61,61,61,Ventilator associated pneumonia and infection control,14.781146,10.078921,2006-04-06,"Ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in intensive care units. The incidence of VAP varies from 7% to 70% in different studies and the mortality rates are 20–75% according to the study population. Aspiration of colonized pathogenic microorganisms on the oropharynx and gastrointestinal tract is the main route for the development of VAP. On the other hand, the major risk factor for VAP is intubation and the duration of mechanical ventilation. Diagnosis remains difficult, and studies showed the importance of early initiation of appropriate antibiotic for prognosis. VAP causes extra length of stay in hospital and intensive care units and increases hospital cost. Consequently, infection control policies are more rational and will save money.","Alp, Emine; Voss, Andreas",Ann Clin Microbiol Antimicrob,47,1

Data on risk factors associated with death of pregnant women and neonates with pH1N1 infections are limited outside of developed countries. METHODS: Retrospective observational study in 394 severe or critical pregnant women admitted to a hospital with pH1N1 influenza from Sep. 1, 2009 to Dec. 31, 2009. rRT-PCR testing was used to confirm infection. In-hospital mortality was the primary endpoint of this study. Univariable logistic analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to investigate the potential factors on admission that might be associated with the maternal and neonatal mortality. RESULTS: 394 pregnant women were included, 286 were infected with pH1N1 in the third trimester. 351 had pneumonia, and 77 died. A PaO(2)/FiO(2 )≤ 200 (odds ratio (OR), 27.16; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.64-279.70) and higher BMI (i.e. ≥ 30) on admission (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.47) were independent risk factors for maternal death. Of 211 deliveries, 146 neonates survived. Premature delivery (OR, 4.17; 95% CI, 1.19-14.56) was associated neonatal mortality. Among 186 patients who received mechanical ventilation, 83 patients were treated with non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and 38 were successful with NIV. The death rate was lower among patients who initially received NIV than those who were initially intubated (24/83, 28.9% vs 43/87, 49.4%; p = 0.006). Septic shock was an independent risk factor for failure of NIV. CONCLUSIONS: Severe hypoxemia and higher BMI on admission were associated with adverse outcomes for pregnant women. Preterm delivery was a risk factor for neonatal death among pregnant women with pH1N1 influenza infection. NIV may be useful in selected pregnant women without septic shock.","Zhang, Peng-jun; Li, Xiao-li; Cao, Bin; Yang, Shi-gui; Liang, Li-rong; Gu, Li; Xu, Zhen; Hu, Ke; Zhang, Hong-yuan; Yan, Xi-xin; Huang, Wen-bao; Chen, Wei; Zhang, Jing-xiao; Li, Lan-juan; Wang, Chen",BMC Infect Dis,47,3
836,836,836,Distinct immunoregulatory cytokine pattern in Egyptian patients with occult Hepatitis C infection and unexplained persistently elevated liver transaminases,14.40531,10.15049,2012,"BACKGROUND/AIM: The immunopathogenesis of occult Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a matter of great controversy and has been suggested to involve a complex balance between cytokines with pro- and anti-inflammatory activity. This work aimed at studying the serum Th1 and Th2 cytokine production in patients with occult HCV infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serum levels of cytokines of Th1 (interleukin [IL]-2, INF-γ) and Th2 (IL-4) were measured in 27 patients with occult HCV infection and 28 patients with chronic hepatitis C infection. RESULTS: The levels of IL-2 and interferon-γ were highly significantly increased in patients with chronic HCV infection (P<0.001). IL-4 was highly significantly increased in occult HCV infection (P<0.001). Significant increases were noted in chronic HCV infection regarding bilirubin (P<0.001), ALT (P = 0.009), AST (P = 0.013), AFP (P<0.001), while serum albumin was significantly higher in occult HCV infection (P<0.001). Necroinflammation (P<0.001), fibrosis (P<0.001), and cirrhosis (P = 0.03) were significantly increased in chronic HCV infection. CONCLUSION: Our data revealed a high prevalence of occult HCV infection (25%) in patients with unexplained persistently abnormal liver function test results. Those patients exhibited a distinct immunoregulatory cytokine pattern, favoring viral persistence and explaining the less aggressive course of this disease entity than chronic HCV infection.","Gad, Yahia Z.; Mouas, Narres; Abdel-Aziz, Azza; Abousmra, Nashwa; Elhadidy, Mona",Asian J Transfus Sci,47,1
1224,1224,1224,Using the Electronic Medical Record to Identify Community-Acquired Pneumonia: Toward a Replicable Automated Strategy,14.40873,9.859675,2013-08-13,"BACKGROUND: Timely information about disease severity can be central to the detection and management of outbreaks of acute respiratory infections (ARI), including influenza. We asked if two resources: 1) free text, and 2) structured data from an electronic medical record (EMR) could complement each other to identify patients with pneumonia, an ARI severity landmark. METHODS: A manual EMR review of 2747 outpatient ARI visits with associated chest imaging identified x-ray reports that could support the diagnosis of pneumonia (kappa score = 0.88 (95% CI 0.82∶0.93)), along with attendant cases with Possible Pneumonia (adds either cough, sputum, fever/chills/night sweats, dyspnea or pleuritic chest pain) or with Pneumonia-in-Plan (adds pneumonia stated as a likely diagnosis by the provider). The x-ray reports served as a reference to develop a text classifier using machine-learning software that did not require custom coding. To identify pneumonia cases, the classifier was combined with EMR-based structured data and with text analyses aimed at ARI symptoms in clinical notes. RESULTS: 370 reference cases with Possible Pneumonia and 250 with Pneumonia-in-Plan were identified. The x-ray report text classifier increased the positive predictive value of otherwise identical EMR-based case-detection algorithms by 20–70%, while retaining sensitivities of 58–75%. These performance gains were independent of the case definitions and of whether patients were admitted to the hospital or sent home. Text analyses seeking ARI symptoms in clinical notes did not add further value. CONCLUSION: Specialized software development is not required for automated text analyses to help identify pneumonia patients. These results begin to map an efficient, replicable strategy through which EMR data can be used to stratify ARI severity.","DeLisle, Sylvain; Kim, Bernard; Deepak, Janaki; Siddiqui, Tariq; Gundlapalli, Adi; Samore, Matthew; D'Avolio, Leonard",PLoS One,47,17
1862,1862,1862,Dietary Sodium Suppresses Digestive Efficiency via the Renin-Angiotensin System,14.479692,10.264239,2015-06-11,"Dietary fats and sodium are both palatable and are hypothesized to synergistically contribute to ingestive behavior and thereby obesity. Contrary to this hypothesis, C57BL/6J mice fed a 45% high fat diet exhibited weight gain that was inhibited by increased dietary sodium content. This suppressive effect of dietary sodium upon weight gain was mediated specifically through a reduction in digestive efficiency, with no effects on food intake behavior, physical activity, or resting metabolism. Replacement of circulating angiotensin II levels reversed the effects of high dietary sodium to suppress digestive efficiency. While the AT(1) receptor antagonist losartan had no effect in mice fed low sodium, the AT(2) receptor antagonist PD-123,319 suppressed digestive efficiency. Correspondingly, genetic deletion of the AT(2) receptor in FVB/NCrl mice resulted in suppressed digestive efficiency even on a standard chow diet. Together these data underscore the importance of digestive efficiency in the pathogenesis of obesity, and implicate dietary sodium, the renin-angiotensin system, and the AT(2) receptor in the control of digestive efficiency regardless of mouse strain or macronutrient composition of the diet. These findings highlight the need for greater understanding of nutrient absorption control physiology, and prompt more uniform assessment of digestive efficiency in animal studies of energy balance.","Weidemann, Benjamin J.; Voong, Susan; Morales-Santiago, Fabiola I.; Kahn, Michael Z.; Ni, Jonathan; Littlejohn, Nicole K.; Claflin, Kristin E.; Burnett, Colin M.L.; Pearson, Nicole A.; Lutter, Michael L.; Grobe, Justin L.",Sci Rep,47,1
2416,2416,2416,Two case reports: Whole genome sequencing of two clinical macrolide-resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae isolates with different responses to azithromycin,14.30341,10.24856,2016-09-23,"BACKGROUND: Cases of macrolide-resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae have increased rapidly since 2000, especially in Asia. Patients infected with macrolide-resistant M pneumoniae usually present with severe M pneumoniae pneumonia. The aim of this study was to identify indicators for whether children at an early stage of M pneumoniae infection develop mild or severe pneumonia. CASE SUMMARY: Herein, we retrospectively reviewed 2 pediatric cases caused by macrolide-resistant M pneumoniae, but with markedly different severity of pneumonia. First, we compared the clinical courses of the patients, then isolated the pathogens and tested their response to macrolides, then finally, carried out whole genome sequencing of these isolates. Despite the difference in clinical presentation of the infection, both isolates exhibited a high level of resistance to macrolide antibiotics. Analysis of clinical data showed that the erythrocyte sedimentation rate in blood samples of the patients in the early stages of disease varied greatly. Genome sequence analysis revealed single nucleotide polymorphisms mainly focused on adhesin P1, which is involved in the pathogenicity of M pneumoniae. CONCLUSION: The differences of erythrocyte sedimentation rate in the early stage of M pneumoniae pneumonia and mutations in P1 protein may help us to distinguish between severe or mild disease after infection with macrolide-resistant M pneumoniae. These findings could lead to the development of screening assays that will allow us to distinguish severe or mild M pneumoniae pneumonia early.","Li, Shaoli; Sun, Hongmei; Liu, Fei; Feng, Yanling; Zhao, Hanqing; Xue, Guanhua; Yan, Chao",Medicine (Baltimore),47,19
2745,2745,2745,"Prevalence, pathogenesis, therapy, and prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with community-acquired pneumonia",14.738962,10.132542,2016-07-21,"It is now well recognised that cardiac events occur relatively commonly in patients with acute community-acquired pneumonia. While these events are more frequent in patients with underlying risk factors—such as those with underlying chronic cardiovascular and respiratory comorbidities, the elderly, and in nursing home residents—they also occur in patients with no underlying risks other than severe pneumonia. Recent research elucidating the underlying pathogenic mechanisms related to these cardiac events has indicated a probable role for platelet activation, which is possibly exacerbated by pneumolysin in the case of pneumococcal infections. This, in turn, has resulted in the identification of possible therapeutic strategies targeting platelet activation, as well as the cardio-toxic activity of pneumolysin. These issues represent the primary focus of the current review.","Feldman, Charles; Anderson, Ronald",Pneumonia (Nathan),47,1
2959,2959,2959,Role of Incretin Axis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease,14.358965,10.247493,2017-12-06,"The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), including Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract and involve a complicated reciprocity of environmental, genetic, and immunologic factors. Despite substantial advances in the foundational understanding of the immunological pathogenesis of IBD, the detailed mechanism of the pathological progression in IBD remains unknown. In addition to Th1/Th2 cells, whose role in IBD has been previously well defined, recent evidence indicates that Th17 cells and Tregs also play a crucial role in the development of IBD. Diets which contain excess sugars, salt, and fat may also be important actors in the pathogenesis of IBD, which may be the cause of high IBD incidence in western developed and industrialized countries. Up until now, the reason for the variance in prevalence of IBD between developed and developing countries has been unknown. This is partly due to the increasing popularity of western diets in developing countries, which makes the data harder to interpret. The enterocrinins glucagon-like peptides (GLPs), including GLP-1 and GLP-2, exhibit notable benefits on lipid metabolism, atherosclerosis formation, plasma glucose levels, and maintenance of gastric mucosa integrity. In addition to the regulation of nutrient metabolism, the emerging role of GLPs and their degrading enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) in gastrointestinal diseases has gained increasing attention. Therefore, here we review the function of the DPP-4/GLP axis in IBD.","Duan, Lihua; Rao, Xiaoquan; Braunstein, Zachary; Toomey, Amelia C.; Zhong, Jixin",Front Immunol,47,17

We investigated the prevalence and the clinical impact of respiratory virus infection in adult patients with HCAP. METHODS: Patients admitted with HCAP or CAP, between January and December 2016, to a tertiary referral hospital in Korea, were prospectively enrolled, and virus identification was performed using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: Among 452 enrolled patients (224 with HCAP, 228 with CAP), samples for respiratory viruses were collected from sputum or endotracheal aspirate in 430 (95.1%) patients and from nasopharyngeal specimens in 22 (4.9%) patients. Eighty-seven (19.2%) patients had a viral infection, and the proportion of those with viral infection was significantly lower in the HCAP than in the CAP group (13.8% vs 24.6%, p = 0.004). In both the HCAP and CAP groups, influenza A was the most common respiratory virus, followed by entero-rhinovirus. The seasonal distributions of respiratory viruses were also similar in both groups. In the HCAP group, the viral infection resulted in a similar length of hospital stay and in-hospital mortality as viral–bacterial coinfection and bacterial infection, and the CAP group showed similar results. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of viral infection in patients with HCAP was lower than that in patients with CAP, and resulted in a similar prognosis as viral–bacterial coinfection or bacterial infection.","Kim, Eun Sun; Park, Kyoung Un; Lee, Sang Hoon; Lee, Yeon Joo; Park, Jong Sun; Cho, Young-Jae; Yoon, Ho Il; Lee, Choon-Taek; Lee, Jae Ho",PLoS One,47,1

We link a deterministic zonal ventilation model for the airborne distribution of infectious material in a hospital ward, with a Markovian multicompartment SIS model for the infection of individuals within this ward, in order to conduct a parametric study on ventilation rates and their effect on the epidemic dynamics. Our stochastic model includes arrival and discharge of patients, as well as the detection of the outbreak by screening events or due to symptoms being shown by infective patients. For each ventilation setting, we measure the infectious potential of a nosocomial outbreak in the hospital ward by means of a summary statistic: the number of infections occurred within the hospital ward until end or declaration of the outbreak. We analytically compute the distribution of this summary statistic, and carry out local and global sensitivity analysis in order to identify the particular characteristics of each ventilation regime with the largest impact on the epidemic spread. Our results show that ward ventilation can have a significant impact on the infection spread, especially under slow detection scenarios or in overoccupied wards, and that decreasing the infection risk for the whole hospital ward might increase the risk in specific areas of the health‐care facility. Moreover, the location of the initial infective individual and the protocol in place for outbreak declaration both form an interplay with ventilation of the ward.","López‐García, Martín; King, Marco‐Felipe; Noakes, Catherine J.",Risk Anal,47,1

Oncological surgeries are conventionally more challenging and complex compared with most nononcological ones.

A validation study was done by in another cohort of 100 patients; however, only 70% of them had pathologically confirmed malignancies (Ann Surg 240(2):205–213, 2004). We attempt to assess SAS as a tool to predict postoperative complications in a series of 100 gynecological oncological patients operated at tertiary care center. SAS score of 100 patients with gynecologic malignancies, undergoing surgery at a tertiary care center, was prospectively collected over 4 years. These patients were observed for development of any complications occurring up to 30 days postsurgery. The complication events were graded as per Clavien-Dindo classification (Indian J Gynecol Oncolog 15:49, 2017). The data obtained was statistically analyzed by chi-square test. Thirty complication events were recorded in these 100 patients over a period of 4 years. Majority of complication events were grade IIIa or less (22 out of 30); there was only one death on 8th postoperative day. Fifty percent of patients were with SAS score of 5 or less developed complications compared with just 22.9% in patients with a score of 6 or more. Lower SAS score might be associated with higher postoperative complications in patients undergoing gynecologic oncological surgeries. Thus, patients with lower scores may benefit from a triage to more intensive postoperative care.","Bhandoria, Geetu; Mane, Jitendra D.",Indian J Surg Oncol,47,22

The paper begins with a clear statement for the new public health approach that includes self-protection and the protection of civil rights.

On this background, the paper examines from an ethical perspective to what extent people with HIV have a responsibility in HIV prevention. The paper argues that a person with HIV has a responsibility to protect his/her partner in the case of a relationship of love.

However, rapid diagnostic methods with high accuracy for tuberculous pleurisy are urgently needed. In the present study, we evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF, LAMP and SAT-TB assay with pleural fluids from culture-positive TBP patients. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 300 patients with exudative pleural effusions used as the samples for Xpert MTB/RIF, LAMP and SAT-TB assay. Of these, 265 including 223 patients diagnosed with TBP and 42 non-TBP patients used as controls were analyzed. RESULTS: The sensitivities of Xpert MTB/RIF (27.4%), LAMP (26.5%) and SAT-TB assay (32.3%) were significantly higher than that of pleural effusion smear (14.3%, X(2) = 20.65, P < 0.001), whereas they were much lower than expected for the analysis of pleural effusion samples. Both SAT-TB assay and Xpert MTB/RIF demonstrated high specificities (100%) and PPVs (100%), but the NPVs of all of the tests were < 22%. The area under ROC curve of pleural effusion smear, LAMP, Xpert MTB/RIF and SAT-TB assays was 0.524 (95% CI 0.431–0.617), 0.632 (95% CI 0.553–0.71), 0.637 (95% CI 0.56–0.714) and 0.673 (95% CI 0.6–0.745).

Using a commercial CFD code FLUENT, we also simulated the effects of the three inlet/outlet configurations on the particle capture in terms of particle trajectories, velocities and travel times. This simulation was in a good agreement with measurements that the FO configuration is the most favorable to particle capture among the tested configurations at a flow rate of 1.1 l min(−1). The effects of particle diameters on the capture will also be discussed. This collector can be used for real-time monitoring of bioaerosols along with cantilever biosensors.","Jang, Jaesung; Akin, Demir; Bashir, Rashid",Meas Sci Technol,47,1

METHODS: A literature search was conducted using the MEDLINE (1966–August 2004) and InternationalPharmaceutical Abstracts (1970–August 2004) databases with the search terms daptomycin, LY146032, and lipopeptide antibiotics. Abstracts of the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy and documents submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration were also reviewed. RESULTS: Phase III study results suggest no difference in efficacy or tolerability between daptomycin 4 mg/kgIV QD and vancomycin or semisynthetic penicillins for complicated skin and skin-structure infections. Animal studies suggest daptomycin may be useful for the treatment of endocarditis. Daptomycin is not indicated for pneumonia, with poorer outcomes than conventional treatment It is available as an IV medication and exhibits 92% plasma protein binding in vitro. In healthy adult humans, daptomycin has a volume of distribution of 0.1 Ukg and a plasma elimination half-life of ∼9 hours, and is eliminated primarily by renal excretion (∼54%). In patients with reduced renal function, including those receiving hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, the dose interval should be 48 hours. No dosage adjustment appears to be necessary for mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The use of daptomycin in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been assessed. The most commonly reported adverse events include constipation, nausea, injection-site reactions, headache, and diarrhea. Patients should also be monitored regularly for skeletal muscle toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Daptomycin may be useful for complicated skin and skin-structure infections and gram-positive pathogens resistant to conventional antimicrobials. However, limited data are currently available for duration of treatment beyond 14 days and at doses >4 mg/kg QD.","Jeu, LilyAnn; Fung, Horatio B.",Clin Ther,47,17

Our previous work demonstrated that resistance by primary SJL/J glial cultures may involve events subsequent to viral gene expression, possibly due to a defect in cell-to-cell spread of the infection. Since S, the virion's major spike glycoprotein, is known to facilitate the spread of infection due to its syncytiogenic properties, we decided to investigate the role of this viral structural protein in resistance by primary SJL/J glial cells. Variants possessing deletions within the S coding region were able to grow in SJL/J glial cells 10–100 times easier and fuse five-times more efficiently than wt virus. Induction of neurologic disease in SJL/J mice following intracranial inoculation with either wt JHMV or the S deletion variant, AT11f cord, was age-dependent, occurring only in animals inoculated under 4 weeks of age. Resistance in older animals to wt and variant viruses could be abrogated by immunosuppression with cyclosporin A. However, both disease incidence and viral brain titers were higher in animals receiving the JHM variant AT11f cord virus, suggesting that SJL/J resistance to neurologic disease may manifest itself through interactions between inefficient cell-to-cell spread of the infection and protective aspects of the immune response.","Pasick, John M.M.; Wilson, Greame A.R.; Morris, Vincent L.; Dales, Samuel",Microb Pathog,47,1

Initial studies of SAFV focused on respiratory and gastrointestinal infection; however, it has also recently been associated with diverse clinical symptoms including the endocrine, cardiovascular, and neurological systems. Given the systemic nature of SAFV, and its high prevalence, understanding its pathogenicity and clinical impact is of utmost importance. This comprehensive review highlights and discusses recent developments in epidemiology, human pathogenicity, animal, and molecular studies related to SAFV. It also provides detailed insights into the neuropathogenicity of SAFV. We argue that human studies have been confounded by coinfections and therefore require support from robust molecular and animal research.

Transcripts were analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. RESULT: The composition of transport teams varied widely. There was strong thematic resonance to suggest that the nature of emergent neonatal transports is unpredictable and poses several significant challenges including staffing, ambulance availability, and administrative support. Teams reported dealing with this unpredictability by engaging in teamwork, gathering experience with staff at referral hospitals, planning for a wide variety of circumstances, specialized training, debriefing after events, and implementing quality improvement strategies. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest potential opportunities for improvement in neonatal transport.

This survey aimed to identify the most accurate definition of regulatory science, to define strategic areas of the regulation of healthcare innovation which can be informed through regulatory science and to explore the training and infrastructure needed to advance UK and international regulatory science. METHODS: A survey was distributed to UK healthcare professionals, academics, patients, health technology assessment agencies, ethicists and trade associations, as well as international regulators, pharmaceutical companies and small or medium enterprises which have expertise in regulatory science and in developing or applying regulation in healthcare. Subsequently, a descriptive quantitative analyses of survey results and directed thematic analysis of free-text comments were applied. RESULTS: Priority areas for UK regulatory science identified by 145 participants included the following: flexibility: the capability of regulations to adapt to novel products and target patient outcomes; co-development: collaboration across sectors, e.g. patients, manufacturers, regulators, and educators working together to develop appropriate training for novel product deployment; responsiveness: the preparation of frameworks which enable timely innovation required by emerging events; speed: the rate at which new products can reach the market; reimbursement: developing effective tools to track and evaluate outcomes for “pay for performance” products; and education and professional development.

Yet, in contrast to studies of single substances, little is known about patterns of polysubstance use in this population. Moreover, other risk factors (e.g., financial hardship, incarceration, homelessness, and mental health distress) are also prevalent and complicate HIV management. The present study drew on a cross-sectional survey with African American/Black and Latino (AABL) adult PLWH from low socioeconomic status backgrounds in New York City who were insufficiently engaged in HIV care and evidenced detectable HIV viral load (N = 512). We used latent class analysis (LCA) to explore patterns of polysubstance use and their relationships to financial hardship, incarceration, homelessness, and mental health. LCA yielded three substance use classes: Class 1, a high polysubstance use/high-risk substance use class (9%); Class 2, a polysubstance use/moderate substance use risk class (18%); and Class 3, a moderate polysubstance use/moderate-to-low-risk substance use class (74%). Mental health symptoms were prevalent in all classes, but Class 1 had greater mental health distress than the other two classes. Current homelessness was more prevalent in Classes 1 and 2. We cannot end the HIV epidemic without engaging and treating AABL PLWH who have serious barriers to engagement along the HIV care continuum, and who evidence polysubstance use along with co-occurring risk factors. Clinical settings can develop outreach and engagement approaches to bring this subpopulation of PLWH into care settings, and further, specialized services are needed to successfully screen, treat, and retain them.","Cleland, Charles M.; Gwadz, Marya; Collins, Linda M.; Wilton, Leo; Sherpa, Dawa; Dorsen, Caroline; Leonard, Noelle R.; Cluesman, Sabrina R.; Martinez, Belkis Y.; Ritchie, Amanda S.; Ayvazyan, Mariam",AIDS Behav,47,22

Previous literature reports significant improvement in IBS symptoms with initiation of a low FODMAP diet (LFD) and monitored reintroduction. However, dietary adherence to the LFD is difficult, with patients stating that the information given by health care providers is often generalized and nonspecific, requiring them to search for supplementary information to fit their needs. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to determine whether Heali, a novel artificial intelligence dietary mobile app can improve adherence to the LFD, IBS symptom severity, and quality of life outcomes in adults with IBS or IBS-like symptoms over a 4-week period. METHODS: Participants were randomized into 2 groups: the control group (CON), in which participants received educational materials, and the experimental group (APP), in which participants received access to the mobile app and educational materials. Over the course of this unblinded online trial, all participants completed a battery of 5 questionnaires at baseline and at the end of the trial to document IBS symptoms, quality of life, LFD knowledge, and LFD adherence. RESULTS: We enrolled 58 participants in the study (29 in each group), and 25 participants completed the study in its entirety (11 and 14 for the CON and APP groups, respectively). Final, per-protocol analyses showed greater improvement in quality of life score for the APP group compared to the CON group (31.1 and 11.8, respectively; P=.04). Reduction in total IBS symptom severity score was 24% greater for the APP group versus the CON group. Although this did not achieve significance (–170 vs –138 respectively; P=.37), the reduction in the subscore for bowel habit dissatisfaction was 2-fold greater for the APP group than for the CON group (P=.05). CONCLUSIONS: This initial study provides preliminary evidence that Heali may provide therapeutic benefit to its users, specifically improvements in quality of life and bowel habits. Although this study was underpowered, findings from this study warrant further research in a larger sample of participants to test the efficacy of Heali app use to improve outcomes for patients with IBS.

Current treatments for leishmaniasis are long, toxic, and expensive and are not available in some endemic regions. Attempts to develop an effective vaccine are feasible, but no vaccine is in active clinical use. In this study, the LmxMBA gene of Leishmania mexicana was selected as a possible vaccine candidate using the reverse vaccinology approach, and the prophylactic effect generated by DNA vaccination with this gene in a murine model of cutaneous leishmaniasis was evaluated. The results showed that prophylactic vaccination with pVAX1::LmxMBA significantly reduced the size of the lesion and the parasitic load on the footpad, compared to the control groups. At a histological level, a smaller number of parasites were evident in the dermis, as well as the absence of connective tissue damage.

Attributed to the PRRSV extensive genetic and antigenic variation and rapid mutability and evolution, nearly worldwide epidemics have been sustained by a set of emerging and re-emerging virus strains. Since the first modified live virus (MLV) vaccine was commercially available, it has been widely used for more than 20 years, for preventing and controlling PRRS. On the one hand, MLV can induce a protective immune response against homologous viruses by lightening the clinical signs of pigs and reducing the virus transmission in the affected herd, as well as helping to cost-effectively increase the production performance on pig farms affected by heterologous viruses. On the other hand, MLV can still replicate in the host, inducing viremia and virus shedding, and it fails to confer sterilizing immunity against PRRSV infection, that may accelerate viral mutation or recombination to adapt the host and to escape from the immune response, raising the risk of reversion to virulence. The unsatisfied heterologous cross-protection and safety issue of MLV are two debatable characterizations, which raise the concerns that whether it is necessary or valuable to use this leaky vaccine to protect the field viruses with a high probability of being heterologous. To provide better insights into the immune protection and safety related to MLV, recent advances and opinions on PRRSV attenuation, protection efficacy, immunosuppression, recombination, and reversion to virulence are reviewed here, hoping to give a more comprehensive recognition on MLV and to motivate scientific inspiration on novel strategies and approaches of developing the next generation of PRRS vaccine.","Zhou, Lei; Ge, Xinna; Yang, Hanchun",Vaccines (Basel),47,1

The efficiency of earthworms in ecology varies along with species. Therefore, the role of taxonomy in earthworm study is significant. The taxonomy of earthworms cannot reliably be established through morphological characteristics because the small and simple body plan of the earthworm does not have anatomical complex and highly specialized structures. Recently, molecular techniques have been adopted to accurately classify the earthworm species but these techniques are time-consuming and costly. To combat this issue, in this study, we propose a machine learning-based earthworm species identification model that uses digital images of earthworms. We performed a stringent performance evaluation not only through 10-fold cross-validation and on an external validation dataset but also in real settings by involving an experienced taxonomist. In all the evaluation settings, our proposed model has given state-of-the-art performance and justified its use to aid earthworm taxonomy studies.

Consumption of the conventional drugs has shown several side effects and drug resistance. This study was aimed to screen some Iranian medicinal plants extracts and their fractions against influenza A virus. METHODS: Glycyrrhiza glabra (rhizome), Myrtus commonis (leaves), Melissa officinalis (leaves), Hypericum perforatum (aerial parts), Tilia platyphyllos (flower), Salix alba (bark), and Camellia sinensis (green and fermented leaves) were extracted with 80% methanol and fractionated with chloroform and methanol, respectively. The cytotoxicity of the compounds were determined by MTT colorimetric assay on MDCK cells. The effective concentrations (EC(50)) of the compounds were calculated from the MTT results compared to the negative control with no significant effects on cell viability. The effects of EC(50) of the compounds on viral surface glycoproteins and viral titer were tested by HI and HA virological assays, respectively and compared with oseltamivir and amantadine. Preliminary phytochemical analysis were done for promising anti-IAV extracts and fractions. RESULTS: The most effective samples against IAV titer (P ≤ 0.05) were crude extracts of G. glabra, M. officinalis and S. alba; methanol fractions of M. communis and M. officinalis; and chloroform fractions of M. communis and C. sinensis (fermented) mostly in co- and pre-penetration combined treatments. The potential extracts and fractions were rich in flavonoids, tannins, steroids and triterpenoids. CONCLUSION: The outcomes confirmed a scientific basis for anti-influenza A virus capacity of the extracts and fractions from the selected plants for the first time, and correlated their effects with their phytochemical constituents. It is worth focusing on elucidating pure compounds and identifying their mechanism(s) of action.

Previous transcriptomic analyses revealed upregulation of TGFB1, cell death and Toll-like receptor signalling, T-cell activation, and inhibition of nitric oxide production in macrophages in response to infection. However, the differences between ovine and bovine responses have not yet been explored. The objective of this study was to further investigate the transcriptomic response of ovine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to F. hepatica infection, and to elucidate the differences between ovine and bovine PBMC responses. Sixteen male Merino sheep were randomly assigned to infected or control groups (n = 8 per group) and orally infected with 120 F. hepatica metacercariae. Transcriptomic data was generated from PBMC at 0, 2 and 16 weeks post-infection (wpi), and analysed for differentially expressed (DE) genes between infected and control animals at each time point (analysis 1), and for each group relative to time 0 (analysis 2). Analysis 2 was then compared to a similar study performed previously on bovine PBMC. A total of 453 DE genes were found at 2 wpi, and 2 DE genes at 16 wpi (FDR < 0.1, analysis 1). Significantly overrepresented biological pathways at 2 wpi included role of PKR in interferon induction and anti-viral response, death receptor signalling and RIG-I-like receptor signalling, which suggested that an activation of innate response to intracellular nucleic acids and inhibition of cellular apoptosis were taking place. Comparison of analysis 2 with the previous bovine transcriptomic study revealed that anti-inflammatory response pathways which were significantly overrepresented in the acute phase in cattle, including IL-10 signalling, Th2 pathway, and Th1 and Th2 activation were upregulated only in the chronic phase in sheep. We propose that the earlier activation of anti-inflammatory responses in cattle, as compared with sheep, may be related to the general absence of acute clinical signs in cattle. These findings offer scope for “smart vaccination” strategies for this important livestock parasite.","Niedziela, Dagmara A.; Naranjo-Lucena, Amalia; Molina-Hernández, Verónica; Browne, John A.; Martínez-Moreno, Álvaro; Pérez, José; MacHugh, David E.; Mulcahy, Grace",Front Immunol,47,1

These include an acute increase in one or more of the following cardinal symptoms, beyond day to day variability: dyspnea, increased frequency or severity of cough and increased volume or change in character of sputum, which represent an acute increase in airway inflammation. The role of infection in the pathogenesis of COPD, acute exacerbation and disease progression has been a clinical and research question for many years, and the pendulum has swung from infection as a major cause of acute exacerbation and COPD (British Hypothesis) [2], to infection as an unrelated epiphomenon in acute exacerbation [3–5], and back again to infection as integral in the development of AECOPD and likely an important contributor to COPD progression [6–19]. Upwards of 80 % of AECOPD are driven by infectious stimuli, with 40–50 % associated with bacterial infection and 30–50 % associated with acute viral infection, with some exacerbations having dual bacterial and viral causation [20]. Much of the advancement in our understanding of the role of infection is AECOPD is due to the advancement of clinical and research tools that have allowed researchers to accurately characterize the microbial pathogens, and better understand the host-pathogen interactions (Table 1).","Provost, Karin; Desai, Himanshu; Sethi, Sanjay",Smoking and Lung Inflammation,47,11

It explains the nature and mechanisms of this mental disorder. These findings lay the ground to analyse the proportionality review: judicial views are contrasted with empirical findings. It is shown that the Court of Justice's – legally relevant(!) – assumptions on gambling addiction are (only) partly supported by empirical evidence. The chapter also establishes that different standards of review have applied to different aspects of gambling regulation, with the most lenient review being applied to national choices of licensing models and the strictest to penalties and procedural requirements in licensing tenders. In a next step, the Court’s review practice is compared to judgments in other areas that involved similar consumer protection concerns (alcohol addiction and youth drinking; internet threats). Again, a diverging standard of review is noted. The chapter inquires the causes for the Court’s peculiar approach to gambling issues. It analyses in particular the political context of the early case law and it identifies passages in the jurisprudence that illustrate a subjective-moral rather than objective-scientific perspective on gambling-related risks. Finally, the chapter addresses the consequences of the Court’s diverging approach. Dealing with gambling as a ‘peculiar issue’ and a topos of public morality led to a lack of a science-informed assessment of gambling-related risks. The chapter notes a ‘judicial vacuum’ in the review practice; the numerous cases referred to the Court of Justice are an expression of this problem as predicted by the late Advocate General Colomer.","Planzer, Simon",Empirical Views on European Gambling Law and Addiction,47,2

Deep neural networks perform this classification task particularly well by utilizing dense document representation in terms of word embeddings. However, this representation model does not consider the sentiment polarity or sentiment intensity of the words. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel model of deep neural network with word-sentiment associations. This model produces richer document representation that incorporates both word context and word sentiment. Specifically, our model utilizes pre-trained word embeddings and lexicon-based sentiment indicators to provide inputs to a deep feed-forward neural network. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, a benchmark dataset of Amazon reviews is used. Our results strongly support integrated document representation, which shows that the proposed model outperforms other existing machine learning approaches to opinion mining of consumer reviews.","Hajek, Petr; Barushka, Aliaksandr; Munk, Michal",Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations,47,1

For efficient management of epidemiological data, it is advisable to use a Geographic Information System (GIS), in which data can be managed based on their geographical component. The advantages of GIS are not only all tools for managing an ordinary database but also functions typical for geographic data. Technical University of Liberec (Czech Republic) with the support of the Technology Agency of the Czech Republic guarantees the design and building of an information system with GIS features designed for the solution of epidemics within the chosen region of the Czech Republic (Regional Hygiene Station of the Liberec Region). The concept of the information system is based on the requirement to use Open Source tools without the need for future license fees. A substantial part of the system is programmed (R language). Data input will be provided by forms and questionnaires (pre-prepared, editable). The database will be based on demographic data along with multiple time and geographical data (useful for the construction of epidemiological curves and data representation in maps). Data input is possible via any platform (desktop, smartphones, mobile GIS for fieldwork). The output console is designed to work with data organized in maps. After the necessary anonymization and aggregation of data, some of the data is designed to be made available to the general public. Emphasis is placed on the communication role of the information system in providing information from and to the public. The research team is multidisciplinary (epidemiologists, geographers, programmers, sociologists). The development of the information system has been started in 2019 on the example of alimentary diseases. A part of it has been used since March 2020 for monitoring COVID-19 within the Liberec Region. Full completion and commissioning are set for 2021. KEY MESSAGES: Geographic Information System is an effective database, analytical and communication tool for epidemilogy. The information system must enable communication with experts and the general public.","Smida, J; Loosova, J; Prattingerova, J; Zabka, V; Vrbik, D; Harman, J; Vaclavikova, L; Sembera, J",Eur J Public Health,47,0

Ultimately, their justification is an ethical one: the duty to save human lives. But while individual policies are intensely discussed, an analysis of the discourse from a meta-perspective remains a desideratum. This paper seeks to contribute to such an analysis. It shows that structurally, the discussion is engaged in a risk-benefit-analysis. Within this analysis the fact that the containment policy itself causes deaths is insufficiently taken into account. In paralleling the current situation with the trolley problem and a ruling of the German Constitutional Court concerning the Luftsicherheitsgesetz (Aviation Security Act), the paper argues that the pandemic presents politicians with the choice to either not prevent the death of some, or sacrifice the lives of others in order to save them. As the latter is ethically dubious and unconstitutional, some of the policies already implemented need to be reevaluated. However, the argument does not imply that any action to mitigate the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic is illegitimate. Thus, the paper closes by examining the ethical conditions for political action in this case.","Schulze Heuling, Dagmar",Z Politikwiss,47,0

This study was designed to assess effect of COVID-19 stressors on healthcare workers’ performance and attitude. A descriptive cross sectional research design was used. A convenient sample (all available healthcare workers) physicians “112,”, nurses “183,” pharmacists “31,” and laboratory technicians “38” was participated to conduct aim of the study. Utilize the study with two tools; online self-administrated questionnaire to assess level of knowledge, attitude, and infection control measures regarding coronavirus disease 2019 and COVID-19 stress scales to assess the varied stressors among healthcare workers. RESULTS: More than three quarter of the studied participants had satisfactory level of knowledge and infection control measures. Approximately all of the studied participants had positive attitude regarding COVID-19. A total of 57.4% of the studied medical participants had moderate COVID-19 psychological stress levels, while 49.1% of the studied paramedical participants had moderate COVID-19 psychological stress levels. But less than one quarter had severe COVID-19 psychological stress levels. There is a significant correlation between COVID-19 psychological stressor levels and satisfactory level of knowledge among medical participants. CONCLUSION/IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Most of healthcare workers had satisfactory level of knowledge, infection control measures, and positive attitude regarding COVID-19. Most of them had moderate COVID-19 psychological stress levels.","Elbqry, Mohammed Goda; Elmansy, Fatma Mohmed; Elsayed, Abeer Ezzat; Mansour, Bassam; Tantawy, Ashraf; Eldin, Maged Bahi; Sayed, Haydy Hassan",Middle East Curr Psychiatry,47,1

Since the composition of the gut microbiome might disturb the normal interaction with the immune system and contribute to altered immune responses, the restoration of normal microbiota composition constitutes a new target for the prevention and treatment of diabetes. Thus, the interaction of gut microbiome and diabetes, focusing on mechanisms connecting gut microbiota with the occurrence of the disorder, is discussed in the present review. Finally, the challenge of functional food diet on maintaining intestinal health and microbial flora diversity and functionality, as a potential tool for the onset inhibition and management of the disease, is highlighted by reporting key animal studies and clinical trials.

Materials & methods: We collected 113 confirmed COVID-19 patients. The dynamic changes of CK, LDH and α-HBDH in patients were studied retrospectively, the correlation between myocardial enzyme index, clinical classification and outcome of patients and its significance to prognosis. Results: There are significant statistical differences between LDH, α-HBDH, CK and the clinical classification, and patient’s outcome. In the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, LDH, α-HBDH and CK have a good diagnostic value for the death outcome of patients. Conclusion: LDH, α-HBDH and CK were the components of myocardial enzyme profiles, and our results found that they were significantly positively correlated with clinical classification and prognosis of COVID-19 patients. The values of LDH, α-HBDH and CK increased with the increase of the severity of admission clinical classification and the deterioration of outcome. Therefore, we propose that continuous monitoring of LDH, α-HBDH and CK indicators can warn the deterioration of COVID-19 to a certain extent, regardless of whether patients with cardiovascular diseases are combined or not, and prompt early intervention.","Cheng, Jingping; Liu, Wanxin; Chen, Siyang; Hu, Xiafen; Xiang, Xiaochen; Cheng, Zhongliang; Cai, Shaoqian; Guo, Kaiwen; Wang, Qiang; Liu, Xiaoliu; Wu, Qingming",,47,22

It is believed to be the foremost common pediatric brain tumor causing death. Early and accurate classification of childhood MB and its classes are of great importance to help doctors choose the suitable treatment and observation plan, avoid tumor progression, and lower death rates. The current gold standard for diagnosing MB is the histopathology of biopsy samples. However, manual analysis of such images is complicated, costly, time-consuming, and highly dependent on the expertise and skills of pathologists, which might cause inaccurate results. This study aims to introduce a reliable computer-assisted pipeline called CoMB-Deep to automatically classify MB and its classes with high accuracy from histopathological images. This key challenge of the study is the lack of childhood MB datasets, especially its four categories (defined by the WHO) and the inadequate related studies. All relevant works were based on either deep learning (DL) or textural analysis feature extractions. Also, such studies employed distinct features to accomplish the classification procedure. Besides, most of them only extracted spatial features. Nevertheless, CoMB-Deep blends the advantages of textural analysis feature extraction techniques and DL approaches. The CoMB-Deep consists of a composite of DL techniques. Initially, it extracts deep spatial features from 10 convolutional neural networks (CNNs). It then performs a feature fusion step using discrete wavelet transform (DWT), a texture analysis method capable of reducing the dimension of fused features. Next, the CoMB-Deep explores the best combination of fused features, enhancing the performance of the classification process using two search strategies. Afterward, it employs two feature selection techniques on the fused feature sets selected in the previous step. A bi-directional long-short term memory (Bi-LSTM) network; a DL-based approach that is utilized for the classification phase. CoMB-Deep maintains two classification categories: binary category for distinguishing between the abnormal and normal cases and multi-class category to identify the subclasses of MB. The results of the CoMB-Deep for both classification categories prove that it is reliable. The results also indicate that the feature sets selected using both search strategies have enhanced the performance of Bi-LSTM compared to individual spatial deep features. CoMB-Deep is compared to related studies to verify its competitiveness, and this comparison confirmed its robustness and outperformance. Hence, CoMB-Deep can help pathologists perform accurate diagnoses, reduce misdiagnosis risks that could occur with manual diagnosis, accelerate the classification procedure, and decrease diagnosis costs.","Attallah, Omneya",Front Neuroinform,47,0

However, we know little about OEND implementation outcomes (i.e., indicators of implementation success), specifically the fidelity of training delivery, and how these may relate to intervention outcomes (i.e., indicators of the success or effectiveness of an intervention), such as overdose knowledge and attitudes. This study evaluated 16 OEND trainings conducted at different Opioid Overdose Prevention Programs in New York City. Trainees (N = 75) completed the Opioid Overdose Knowledge and Attitude Scales before and after training (intervention outcomes). Implementation outcomes were fidelity (competence and adherence of the trainer, N = 10; modified Fidelity Checklist) and acceptability of OEND (Acceptability of Intervention Measure), assessed from multiple perspectives (trainees, trainers, and an independent observer). Trainees’ overdose knowledge, t(71) = − 8.12, p < 0.001, 95% CI [− 6.54, − 3.96], and attitudes, t(65) = − 6.85, p < 0.001, 95% CI [− 0.59, − 0.33], improved significantly from pre- to post-training. Stepwise multiple regression models indicated that adherence of the trainer rated from the observer perspective added significantly to the prediction of changes in overdose knowledge, F(1, 67) = 9.81, p = 0.003, and explained 13% of the variance in outcome. However, fidelity measures from the perspective of trainees or trainers and acceptability of OEND were not associated with changes in trainees’ overdose knowledge or attitudes. OEND implementation outcomes and their relationship with intervention outcomes differed depending on the role of the fidelity rater in relation to the intervention. Specifically, our findings indicate that fidelity should be measured from an independent perspective (i.e., an individual who is experienced with fidelity rating but not directly involved in the intervention).

In this study, we propose a within-host mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 infection considering innate and adaptive immune responses. We analyze the equilibrium points of the proposed model and obtain an expression of the basic reproduction number. We then numerically show the existence of a transcritical bifurcation. The proposed model is calibrated to real viral load data of two COVID-19 patients. Using the estimated parameters, we perform global sensitivity analysis with respect to the peak of viral load. Finally, we study the efficacy of antiviral drugs and vaccination on the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results suggest that blocking the virus production from infected cells can be an effective target for antiviral drug development. Finally, it is found that vaccination is more effective intervention as compared to the antiviral treatments.","Ghosh, Indrajit",SN Comput Sci,47,20

Thus, pharmaceutical formulators are constantly looking for new, biologically acceptable, and low-cost armamentarium for parenteral formulation development. Cyclodextrins (CDs) are enabling pharmaceutical excipients that can temporarily camouflage undesirable physiochemical drug properties such as low aqueous solubility through formation of drug/CD inclusion complexes. CDs are cyclic oligosaccharides that have similar physiological and biological properties like linear saccharides of comparable molecular weight. Due to their very favorable toxicological and pharmacokinetic profiles their usage in parenteral drug formulations is frequently preferred over other solubilizing techniques. Here the physiochemical and biological properties of CDs are reviewed as well as their pharmacokinetics after intravenous administration. Their regulatory status is briefly reviewed and their tendency to self-assemble to form clusters or aggregates discussed. Finally, some examples are given of how CDs are applied in aqueous parenteral formulations, how their solubilizing effect has been enhanced and how their target concentration is determined.","Loftsson, Thorsteinn",Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,47,12

Until now, no data exist concerning the extent of oesophageal insufflation when oropharyngeal leak pressures are exceeded. METHODS Laryngeal masks LMA-Supreme™ and LMA-ProSeal™, laryngeal tubes LTS-D and LTS II, Combitube™, and I-Gel were inserted into unfixed human cadavers. The oesophagus was connected to a volumeter, while the trachea was closed surgically to simulate complete airway obstruction. Volumes of oesophageal insufflation resulting from pressure-controlled ventilation at inspiratory pressures of 20, 40, and 60 mbar were measured. RESULTS No oesophageal insufflation could be detected at a ventilation pressure of 20 mbar in any device. Using inspiratory pressures of 40 and 60 mbar, oesophageal insufflation occurred in all devices, with significantly higher volumes of intraoesophageal air for both laryngeal tubes. CONCLUSIONS The use of SADs with inspiratory pressures of 20 mbar appears to be safe regarding the risk of intragastric insufflation.

Emerging data related to mechanism of severity and potential therapies for patients presenting with severe symptoms are scattered and therefore require a comprehensive analysis to focus research on developing effective therapeutics. A critical literature review suggests that the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with dysregulation of inflammatory immune responses, which in turn inhibits the development of protective immunity to the infection. Therefore, the use of therapeutics that modulate inflammation without compromising the adaptive immune response could be the most effective therapeutic strategy.","Manjili, Rose H; Zarei, Melika; Habibi, Mehran; Manjili, Masoud H",Journal of immunology,47,16

We conclude that in the presence of overwhelming hemolysis, plasma can become so icteric that optimetric laboratory evaluation is impossible. In this setting, PEX can be used to clear the plasma, restoring the ability to perform routine laboratory assessments.","Said, Ahmed; Hmiel, Paul; Goldsmith, Matthew; Dietzen, Dennis; Hartman, Mary E",Pediatrics,47,1

Hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HDX) reaction coupled with top-down mass spectrometric (MS) analysis provides a means to characterize protein higher-order structures and dynamics in a conformer-specific manner. The conformational resolving power of this technique is highly dependent on the efficiencies of separating protein states at the intact protein level and minimizing the residual non-deuterated protic content during the HDX reactions. Here we describe a capillary electrophoresis (CE)-based variant of the HDX MS approach that aims to improve the conformational resolution. In this approach, proteins undergo HDX reactions while migrating through a deuterated background electrolyte solution (BGE) during the capillary electrophoretic separation. Different protein states or proteoforms that coexist in solution can be efficiently separated based on their differing charge-to-size ratios. The difference in electrophoretic mobility between proteins and protic solvent molecules minimizes the residual non-deuterated solvent, resulting in a nearly complete deuterating environment during the HDX process. The flow-through microvial CE-MS interface allows efficient electrospray ionization of the eluted protein species following a rapid mixing with the quenching and denaturing modifier solution at the outlet of the sprayer. The online top-down MS analysis measures the global deuteration level of the eluted intact protein species, and subsequently, the deuteration of their gas-phase fragments. This paper demonstrates this approach in differential HDX for systems, including the natural protein variants coexisting in milk.","Chaihu, Lingxiao; Yao, Xiaopeng; Xu, Xiang; Zhu, Zhongqin; Chen, David D Y; Wang, Guanbo",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,47,1

However, no specific antiviral drugs are available to prevent or treat HCoV infections to date. Here, we developed four infectious recombinant HCoVs-OC43 (rHCoVs-OC43) which express the Renilla luciferase (Rluc) reporter gene. Among these four rHCoVs-OC43, rOC43-ns2DelRluc (generated by replacing ns2 with the Rluc gene) showed robust luciferase activity with only a slight impact on its growth characteristics. Additionally, this recombinant virus remained stable for at least 10 passages in BHK-21 cells. rOC43-ns2DelRluc was comparable to its parental wild-type virus (HCoV-OC43-WT) with respect to the quantity of the antiviral activity of chloroquine and ribavirin. We showed that chloroquine strongly inhibited HCoV-OC43 replication in vitro, with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.33 μM. However, ribavirin showed inhibition of HCoV-OC43 replication only at high concentrations which may not be applicable to humans in clinical treatment, with an IC50 of 10 μM. Furthermore, using a luciferase-based small interfering RNA (siRNA) screening assay, we identified double-stranded-RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) and DEAD box RNA helicases (DDX3X) that exhibited antiviral activities, which were further verified by the use of HCoV-OC43-WT. Therefore, rOC43-ns2DelRluc represents a promising safe and sensitive platform for high-throughput antiviral screening and quantitative analysis of viral replication.","Shen, Liang; Yang, Yang; Ye, Fei; Liu, Gaoshan; Desforges, Marc; Talbot, Pierre J; Tan, Wenjie",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,47,1

Quarantine measures have influenced pregnant women's daily lives. The aim of this study is to understand the impact of the changes imposed by COVID-19 emergency on the wellbeing of pregnant women and how the transformation of Schiavonia Hospital into a dedicated Covid Hospital affected their pregnancy experience. METHODS A cross-sectional survey was conducted. Pregnant women who gave birth in Schiavonia Hospital during the period May-September 2020 have been included. The assessment examined clinical characteristics, attitudes in relation to the pandemic and how it affected birth plans, perception of information received and attitudes regards giving birth in a Covid Hospital. RESULTS 104 women responded to the survey, with an enrolment rate of 58%. About the influence of COVID-19 pandemic, 51% of respondents reported changing some aspect of their lifestyle. The identification of Schiavonia hospital as Covid Hospital did not modify the trust in the facility and in the Obstetrics Ward for the 90% of women, in fact for the 85,6% it was the planned Birth Centre since the beginning of pregnancy. The communication was complete and exhaustive for 82,7% of the respondents. CONCLUSIONS Despite the Covid Hospital transformation, the women who came to give birth at Schiavonia Birth Centre rated the healthcare assistance received at high level, evidencing high affection for the structure and the healthcare workers.","Dorizzi, Carlo; Scotton, Francesca; Merlin, Federica; Guidetti, Giulia; Marcon, Elena; Montemurro, Domenico; Rigo, Alberto; Benini, Patrizia",Minerva ginecologica,47,16

We investigated the infectious etiologies in respiratory specimens from pediatric patients with unexpected cardiopulmonary deterioration using next-generation sequencing. DESIGN Retrospective, single-center, observational study. SETTING Tertiary care, a children's hospital. SUBJECTS The study enrolled a total of 16 pediatric patients with unexpected cardiopulmonary deterioration who were admitted to the PICU. Ten bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and six transtracheal aspirate samples were analyzed. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS RNA libraries were prepared from specimens and analyzed using next-generation sequencing. One or more bacterial/viral pathogens were detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid or transtracheal aspirate specimens from 10 patients. Bacterial and viral coinfection was considered in four cases. Compared with the conventional culture and viral antigen test results, an additional six bacterial and four viral pathogens were identified by next-generation sequencing. Conversely, among 18 pathogens identified by the conventional methods, nine pathogens were detected by next-generation sequencing. Candidate pathogens (e.g., coxsackievirus A6 and Chlamydia trachomatis) were detected by next-generation sequencing in four of 10 patients in whom no causative pathogen had been identified by conventional methods. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that viral and bacterial infections are common triggers in unexpected cardiopulmonary deterioration in pediatric patients. Next-generation sequencing has the potential to contribute to clarification of the etiology of pediatric critical illness.","Takeuchi, Suguru; Kawada, Jun-Ichi; Horiba, Kazuhiro; Yamaguchi, Makoto; Okumura, Toshihiko; Suzuki, Takako; Torii, Yuka; Kawabe, Shinji; Wada, Sho; Ikeyama, Takanari; Ito, Yoshinori",Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies,47,26

If it exceeds 1, the number of incident cases will inevitably grow over time, and a large epidemic is possible. To prevent the expansion of an epidemic, R must be reduced to a level below 1. To estimate the reproduction number, the probability distribution function of the generation interval of an infectious disease is required to be available; however, this distribution is often unknown. In this paper, given the incomplete information for the generation interval, we propose a maximum entropy method to estimate the reproduction number. Based on this method, given the mean value and variance of the generation interval, we first determine its probability distribution function and in turn estimate the real-time values of the reproduction number of COVID-19 in China and the United States. By applying these estimated reproduction numbers into the susceptible-infectious-removed epidemic model, we simulate the evolutionary tracks of the epidemics in China and the United States, both of which are in accordance with that of the real incident cases.","Tao, Yong",Physical review.

METHODS Cross-sectional data from 242 adolescent participants in the Teen-Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (Teen-LABS) study before weight loss surgery were analyzed. Kidney status was assessed by measuring urine albumin creatinine ratio to determine microalbuminuria and by calculating serum cystatin C-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) to assess kidney function. RESULTS Mean age and median body mass index (BMI) were 17.1 years and 50.5 kg/m(2) , respectively; 76% were females and 65% were non-Hispanic white race. Fourteen percent of the cohort had microalbuminuria, and 3% had macroalbuminuria; 3% had eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) , and 7.1% had eGFR > 150 ml/min/1.73 m(2) . In adjusted analyses, female gender and increasing ferritin levels were significantly associated with the presence of microalbuminuria/macroalbuminuria. Increasing BMI and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance values were significantly associated with lower eGFR.

The robot's contribution of increased stability and dexterity may be beneficial in technically challenging surgeries, namely, inguinal hernia repair. The aim of this project is to contribute to the growing body of literature on robotic technology for inguinal hernia repair (RIHR) by sharing our experience with RIHR at a large, academic institution. We performed a retrospective chart review spanning from March 2015 to April 2018 on all patients who had undergone RIHR at our university hospital. Extracted data include preoperative demographics, operative features, and postoperative outcomes. Data were analyzed with particular focus on complications, including hernia recurrence. A total of 43 patients were included, 40 of which were male. Mean patient age was 56 (range 18-85 years) and mean patient BMI was 26.4 (range 17.5-42.3). Bilateral hernias were diagnosed in 13 patients. All of the patients received transabdominal approaches, and all but one received placement of synthetic polypropylene mesh. There was variety in mesh placement with 23 patients receiving suture fixation and 14 receiving tack fixation. Several patients received a combination of suture, tacks, and surgical glue. Mean patient in-room time was 4.0 h, mean operative time was 2.9 h, and mean robotic dock time was 2.0 h. Regarding intraoperative complications, there was one bladder injury, which was discovered intraoperatively and repaired primarily. Same-day discharges were achieved in 32 patients (74.4%) of patients. One patient was admitted overnight for management of urinary retention. Additional ten patients were admitted for observation. Post-operatively, none of the cases resulted in wound infections. Eleven patients developed seromas and one patient was diagnosed with a groin hematoma. Median follow-up was 37.5 days, and one recurrence was reported during this time. The recurrent hernia in this case was initially discovered during a separate case and was repaired with temporary mesh. The use of the robot is safe and effective and should be considered an acceptable approach to inguinal hernia repair. Future prospective studies will help define which patients will benefit most from this technology.","Maas, Marissa C; Alicuben, Evan T; Houghton, Caitlin C; Samakar, Kamran; Sandhu, Kulmeet K; Dobrowolsky, Adrian; Lipham, John C; Katkhouda, Namir; Bildzukewicz, Nikolai A",Journal of robotic surgery,47,16

BACKGROUND During the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak, Spanish and Italian intensive care units were overwhelmed by the demand for admissions. This fact revealed a crucial problem of shortage of health resources and rendered that decision-making was highly complex. SOURCES OF EVIDENCE Applying a nominal group technique this manuscript identifies a series of factors that may have played a role in the emergence of the ethical conflicts in critical care units during the COVID-19 pandemic, considering ethical principles and responsibilities included in the International Council of Nurses Code of Ethics. The five factors identified were the availability of resources; the protection of healthcare workers; the circumstances surrounding decision-making, end-of-life care, and communication. DISCUSSION The impact of COVID-19 on health care will be long-lasting and nurses are playing a central role in overcoming this crisis. Identifying these five factors and the conflicts that have arisen during the COVID-19 pandemic can help to guide future policies and research. CONCLUSIONS Understanding these five factors and recognizing the conflicts, they may create can help to focus our efforts on minimizing the impact of the ethical consequences of a crisis of this magnitude and on developing new plans and guidelines for future pandemics. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE AND POLICY Learning more about these factors can help nurses, other health professionals, and policymakers to focus their efforts on minimizing the impact of the ethical consequences of a crisis of this scale. This will enable changes in organizational policies, improvement in clinical competencies, and development of the scope of practice.","Falcó-Pegueroles, Anna; Zuriguel-Pérez, Esperanza; Via-Clavero, Gemma; Bosch-Alcaraz, Alejandro; Bonetti, Loris",International nursing review,47,1

In our previous study, we found elevated plasma levels of IL-38 in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, the clear relationship of IL-38 expression in plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and clinical and laboratory features needs elucidation. Additionally, we evaluated the possible role of IL-38 in regulating production of inflammatory cytokines in PBMCs in vitro. A pristane-induced murine lupus model was used to further demonstrate the effects of IL-38 on cytokines in vivo and discuss the significance of IL-38 in lupus development. The results showed that mRNA expression of IL-38 in PBMCs of patients with SLE was elevated compared with volunteers, and expression of IL-38 in both plasma and PBMCs was strongly related to clinical features, such as haematuria and proteinuria, and correlated with a SLEDAI score. Plasma levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-23 were elevated in patients with SLE and were related to plasma levels of IL-38. In vitro, PBMCs of patients with SLE stimulated with IL-38 showed a decreased expression of the four inflammatory cytokines compared with PBMCs of patients without treatment. Interestingly, IL-38 administration in lupus mice significantly reduced the development of lupus, such as reduced proteinuria, improved histological examinations of the kidneys and down-regulated inflammatory cytokines. In conclusion, IL-38 may suppress synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines and therefore regulate lupus pathogenesis.","Xu, Wang-Dong; Su, Lin-Chong; Liu, Xiao-Yan; Wang, Jia-Min; Yuan, Zhi-Chao; Qin, Zhen; Zhou, Xi-Ping; Huang, An-Fang",Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,47,1

However, the commonly used methods for anchoring the transplanted tendon have some drawbacks. Therefore, we developed a new tendon-anchoring method to improve fixation of the transferred tendon and reduce the related complications. The new method entails tying the anchoring suture to the navicular bone instead of the button on the plantar foot to avoid wound complications. It requires no additional skin incisions or special equipment. We retrospectively evaluated 24 feet of 19 pediatric patients (13 [68.4%] females and 6 [31.6%] males) who had undergone anterior transfer of the tibialis posterior tendon with our new method from 2000 to 2013. All patients were clinically followed up. At the final follow-up visit, they were evaluated while standing and walking, and the range of motion of the foot was evaluated. The mean age at surgery was 7.8 (range 2 to 16) years. At the longest follow-up point, all the patients exhibited improved gait, except for 1 patient who required a secondary procedure. All the transferred tibialis posterior tendons could be palpated with certainty during active dorsiflexion or withdrawal of the foot. No tendon displacements, wound infections, or postoperative complications were observed. Fixation of a transferred tibialis posterior tendon by tying the suture to the navicular bone is simple and reliable. This technique can efficiently prevent the plantar ulcers that can develop with the traditional pull-out button method and provides a solution when appropriate-size bioabsorbable interference screws are unavailable.","Shen, Po-Chih; Chou, Shih-Hsiang; Chen, Jian-Chih; Chen, Shu-Jung; Tien, Yin-Chun",The Journal of foot and ankle surgery : official publication of the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons,47,17

Several machine learning algorithms (ML) and AI approaches have been developed for systematic identification of drug repurposing leads based on big data resources, hence further accelerating and de-risking the drug development process by computational means. Areas covered: The authors focus especially on supervised ML and AI methods that make use of publicly available databases and information resources. While most of the example applications are in the field of anticancer drug therapies, the methods and resources reviewed are widely applicable also to other indications including COVID-19 treatment. A particular emphasis is placed on the use of comprehensive target activity profiles of drugs that enable systematic repurposing process by extending the target profile of a drug to include potent off-targets with therapeutic potential for a new indication. Expert opinion: The scarcity of clinical patient data and the current focus on genetic aberrations as the primary drug targets may limit the performance of anticancer drug repurposing approaches that rely solely on genomics-based information. Functional testing of cancer patient cells exposed to large number of targeted therapies and their combinations provides an additional source of repurposing information for tissue-aware AI approaches.","Tanoli, Ziaurrehman; Vähä-Koskela, Markus; Aittokallio, Tero",Expert opinion on drug discovery,47,31

Graphene oxide (GO) is widely used for gene delivery for the distinct physiochemical properties and minimal cytotoxicity. Methods Polyethyleneimine (PEI)-functionalized GO complex was well-prepared and loaded with miR-214 inhibitor at different concentrations. The load efficacy was tested by gel retardation assay and the cy3-labeled fluorescence of cellular uptake. The experiments of wound healing, immunofluorescence staining, Western blot, qRT-PCR and immunohistochemical staining were performed to measure the inhibitory effect of the miR-214 inhibitor systematically released from the complexes against MG63, U2OS cells and xenograft tumors. Results The systematic mechanistic elucidation of the efficient delivery of the miR-214 inhibitor by GO-PEI indicated that the inhibition of cellular miR-214 caused a decrease in osteosarcoma cell invasion and migration and an increase in apoptosis by targeting phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). The synergistic combination of the GO-PEI-miR-214 inhibitor and CDDP chemotherapy showed significant cell death. In a xenograft mouse model, the GO-PEI-miR-214 inhibitor significantly inhibited tumor volume growth. Conclusion This study indicates the potential of functionalized GO-PEI as a vehicle for miRNA inhibitor delivery to treat osteosarcoma with low toxicity and miR-214 can be a good target for osteosarcoma therapy.","Ou, Lingling; Lin, Haiyingjie; Song, Yuwei; Tan, Guoqiang; Gui, Xiujuan; Li, Jinyuan; Chen, Xiaoting; Deng, Zhendong; Lin, Shaoqiang",International journal of nanomedicine,47,31

Positive ureteric margins were found in 8.9% of patients. The average follow-up was 27.5 months (1-52). Daytime continence could be achieved in 89.2% of patients who underwent intracorporeal neobladder. The 3-year cancer specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) was 80.2% and 69.8% respectively. CONCLUSIONS RARC with intracorporeal diversion is safe and reproducible in 'non-pioneer' tertiary centers with robotic expertise having acceptable operative time and complications as well as comparable functional and oncologic outcomes.","Sim, Allen; Balbay, Mevlana Derya; Todenhöfer, Tilman; Aufderklamm, Stefan; Halalsheh, Omar; Mischinger, Johannes; Böttge, Johannes; Rausch, Steffen; Bier, Simone; Stenzl, Arnulf; Gakis, Georgios; Schwentner, Christian; Canda, Abdullah Erdem",Central European journal of urology,47,24

PSARP bisects the sphincter muscle complex, introducing muscle injury and scarring. LAARP uses a straight trocar to traverse an often non-linear sphincter muscle complex. MRI-assisted LAARP (MRI-LAARP) guides the neorectum precisely through the middle of the entire sphincter complex along its trajectory. We present our experience utilizing MRI intraoperatively during LAARP. METHODS/PROCEDURE Ten children underwent MRI-LAARP procedures. Intraoperative MRI was performed to delineate the sphincter complex, and to guide the advancement of an MRI-compatible needle through the center of the complex from skin to the peritoneal cavity. The remainder of the procedure was completed using the standard LAARP technique. RESULTS All had successful MRI needle placement through the sphincter complex. Nine patients had successful laparoscopic pull-through procedures; one was converted to open due to severe intraperitoneal adhesions. Postoperative stay averaged 5.4 ± 4.4 days. Out of the ten patients, one child had mild dehiscence of the anal anastomosis requiring revision 11 days postoperatively. CONCLUSION The theoretical advantage of the MRI-LAARP is placing the neorectum through the entire sphincter complex without transecting the muscle. Follow-up of these patients shows good short-term results; however, long-term follow-up will be needed to best assess sphincter and bowel function.","Thomas, Tina T; Teitelbaum, Daniel H; Smith, Ethan A; Dillman, Jonathan R; Vellody, Ranjith; Jarboe, Marcus D",Pediatric surgery international,47,12

It is much less invasive with short hospital stays and presents similar results compared with SAVR. Different ""minimalist approach strategies"" were proposed in order to obtain this performance. In these settings, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) became less relevant for the TAVR procedure. The present review provides an update regarding the safety of TAVR without intraprocedural TEE. RECENT FINDINGS Transthoracic echocardiography and fluoroscopy are the primary imaging tools during TAVR. Several studies proved that TAVR under local anesthesia without TEE is as safe as that performed under TEE guidance. However, not all patients have a proper window for TTE, and particular cases with complex anatomy can benefit from TEE support during the intervention. Intraprocedural TEE no longer plays a crucial role in the TAVR procedure, but in some instances, it remains of great help to detect and avoid complications.","Gheorghe, Livia; Brouwer, Jorn; Gutierrez, Alejandro; Rensing, Benno J W M; Rana, Bushra S; Ten Berg, Jurrien M; Eefting, Frank D; Timmers, Leo; Swaans, Martin J",Current cardiology reports,47,12

However, there was no significant difference in the content of (+2)DTA, a metabolite of (+2)AA, among all the groups. These results suggest that dietary (+2)DTA and (+2)AA pass through the blood-brain barrier and dietary (+2)AA is rather stored in the brain than converted to (+2)DTA.","Yoshinaga, Kazuaki; Ishikawa, Haruna; Beppu, Fumiaki; Gotoh, Naohiro",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,47,1

A dataset with 44 variants and records of seven meat traits in 192 lambs (pH0, pH24, a*, b*, L*, tenderness assessed by shear force, and water-holding capacity) was used. Single-locus and haplotype association analyses were performed, and the significance threshold was established according to Bonferroni's method. Single-locus analysis revealed two associations at a Bonferroni level, where the variant c.935-185C > G in MyoD1 had an additive effect (-4.31 ± 1.08 N) on tenderness, while the variant c.464 + 185G > A in MyoG had an additive effect (-2.86 ± 0.64) on a*. Additionally, the haplotype replacement GT>AC in MSTN was associated with pH0 (1.26 ± 0.31), pH24 (1.07 ± 0.27), a* (-1.40 ± 0.51), and tenderness (3.83 ± 1.22 N), while the replacement GT > AG in MyoD1 was associated with pH0 (1.43 ± 0.26), pH24 (1.25 ± 0.22), b* (-1.06 ± 0.39), and tenderness (-4.13 ± 1.16 N).

It is recommended that unnecessary casting be avoided in the events that alternative methods can be applied such as in stable ankle fractures, and hindfoot/midfoot/forefoot injuries. Fiberglass casts are suboptimal because they require a follow up for cast removal while a conventional plaster cast is amenable to self-removal by submerging in water and cutting the cotton bandages with scissors. At present, only fiberglass casts are widely available to allow waterproof casting. To reduce the contact time during casting, a custom-made 3D printed casts/splints can be ordered remotely which reduces the number of visits and shortens the contact time while it allows for self-removal by the patient. The cast is printed after the limb is 3D scanned in 5-10 seconds using the commercially available 3D scanners. In contrast to the conventional casting, a 3D printed cast/splint is washable which is an advantage during an infectious crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sedigh, Ashkan; Kachooei, Amir R; Beredjiklian, Pedro K; Vaccaro, Alexander R; Rivlin, Michael",The archives of bone and joint surgery,47,17

In situ stabilization is an effective and low-cost method to remediate heavy metal-contaminated sediment. In this study, a red mud-based low-cost composite (RMM) was used to stabilize heavy metal-contaminated sediment. RMM was mixed with heavy metal-contaminated sediment at the doses of 0%, 1%, 3% and 5%. The CaCl2-extractable, DTPA-extractable, leachability (TCLP) and heavy metal fractions were analysed to evaluate the stabilization efficiency of RMM for heavy metals. The selected properties and microbial activities of the sediment were analysed to verify the safety of RMM to sediment. The results showed that RMM reduced the DTPA-, CaCl2- and TCLP-extractable heavy metals in sediment. At an RMM dose of 5%, DTPA-, CaCl2- and TCLP- extractable heavy metals were reduced by 7.60%, 72.34% and 69.24% for Pb; 18.20%, 76.7% and 23.57% for Cd; 32.7%, 96.50% and 49.64% for Zn; and 35.0%, 61.20% and 55.27% for Ni, respectively. TCLP- and DTPA-extractable Cu was reduced by 71.15% and 12.90%, respectively. In contrast, CaCl2-extractable Cu increased obviously after the application of RMM. RMM reduced the acid-soluble fraction of Zn by 6.99% and increased the residual fraction of Ni by 4.28%. However, the influence of RMM on the fractions of Pb, Cd and Cu was nonsignificant. In addition, the application of RMM increased the pH values of the sediment, and the microbial activity in the sediment was also obviously enhanced. These results indicated that RMM has great potential in the remediation of heavy metal-contaminated sediment.","Ma, Xiaoyu; Ren, Qiang; Zhan, Wenhao; Hu, Chao; Zhao, Mengke; Tian, Yuan; Liao, Qi; Yang, Zhihui; Wang, Yangyang",Environmental science and pollution research international,47,1

There will most likely be significant oscillations in numbers of cases for the foreseeable future, based on the regional epidemiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Less affected hospitals and facilities will attempt to progressively resume elective procedures and surgery. Ramping up elective care in hospitals that deliberately curtailed elective care to focus on SARS-CoV-2-infected patients will present unique and serious challenges. Among the challenges will be protecting patients and providers from recurrent outbreaks of disease while increasing procedure throughput. Anesthesia providers will inevitably be exposed to SARS-CoV-2 by patients who have not been diagnosed with infection. This is particularly concerning in consideration that aerosols produced during airway management may be infective. In this article, we recommend an approach to routine anesthesia care in the setting of persistent but variable prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We make specific recommendations for personal protective equipment and for the conduct of anesthesia procedures and workflow based on evidence and expert opinion. We propose practical, relatively inexpensive precautions that can be applied to all patients undergoing anesthesia. Because the SARS-CoV-2 virus is spread primarily by respiratory droplets and aerosols, effective masking of anesthesia providers is of paramount importance. Hospitals should follow the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for universal masking of all providers and patients within their facilities. Anesthesia providers should perform anesthetic care in respirator masks (such as N-95 and FFP-2) whenever possible, even when the SARS-CoV-2 test status of patients is negative. Attempting to screen patients for infection with SARS-CoV-2, while valuable, is not a substitute for respiratory protection of providers, as false-negative tests are possible and infected persons can be asymptomatic or presymptomatic. Provision of adequate supplies of respirator masks and other respiratory protection equipment such as powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs) should be a high priority for health care facilities and for government agencies. Eye protection is also necessary because of the possibility of infection from virus coming into contact with the conjunctiva. Because SARS-CoV-2 persists on surfaces and may cause infection by contact with fomites, hand hygiene and surface cleaning are also of paramount importance.","Bowdle, Andrew; Jelacic, Srdjan; Shishido, Sonia; Munoz-Price, L Silvia",Anesthesia and analgesia,47,1

METHODS Peripheral blood samples were collected from the proband and his pedigree members for the extraction of genomic DNA. Mutational analysis was performed on the proband through whole-exome sequencing. Suspected variant was verified by Sanger sequencing. A series of molecular methods including PCR amplification, restriction enzyme digestion, ligation and transformation were also used to construct wild-type and mutant eukaryotic expression vectors of the PKD2 gene, which were transfected into HEK293T and HeLa cells for the observation of protein expression and cell localization. RESULTS The proband was found to harbor a c.2051dupA (p. Tyr684Ter) frame shift mutation of the PKD2 gene, which caused repeat of the 2051st nucleotide of its cDNA sequence and a truncated protein. Immunofluorescence experiment showed that the localization of the mutant protein within the cell was altered compared with the wild-type, which may be due to deletion of the C-terminus of the PKD2 gene.

The removal of ubiquitin from innate immunity signaling factors by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) therefore provides a potential opportunity for viruses to evade this host defense system. It was previously found that specific proteases encoded by the unrelated arteri- and nairoviruses resemble the ovarian tumor domain-containing (OTU) family of DUBs. In arteriviruses, this domain has been characterized before as a papain-like protease (PLP2) that is also involved in replicase polyprotein processing. In nairoviruses, the DUB resides in the polymerase protein but is not essential for RNA replication. Using both in vitro and cell-based assays, we now show that PLP2 DUB activity is conserved in all members of the arterivirus family and that both arteri- and nairovirus DUBs inhibit RIG-I-mediated innate immune signaling when overexpressed. The potential relevance of RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling for the innate immune response against arterivirus infection is supported by our finding that in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, the production of beta interferon primarily depends on the recognition of arterivirus RNA by the pattern-recognition receptor MDA5. Interestingly, we also found that both arteri- and nairovirus DUBs inhibit RIG-I ubiquitination upon overexpression, suggesting that both MDA5 and RIG-I have a role in countering infection by arteriviruses. Taken together, our results support the hypothesis that arteri- and nairoviruses employ their deubiquitinating potential to inactivate cellular proteins involved in RLR-mediated innate immune signaling, as exemplified by the deubiquitination of RIG-I.","van Kasteren, Puck B; Beugeling, Corrine; Ninaber, Dennis K; Frias-Staheli, Natalia; van Boheemen, Sander; García-Sastre, Adolfo; Snijder, Eric J; Kikkert, Marjolein",Journal of virology,47,12

Amid this public health emergency, the urgent need for palliative care integration throughout critical care settings has never been more crucial. OBJECTIVE To promote palliative care engagement in critical care; share palliative care resources to support critical care nurses in alleviating suffering during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic; and make recommendations to strengthen nursing capacity to deliver high-quality, person-centered critical care. Methods Palliative and critical care literature and practice guidelines were reviewed, synthesized, and translated into recommendations for critical care nursing practice. RESULTS Nurses are ideally positioned to drive full integration of palliative care into the critical care delivery for all patients, including those with coronavirus disease 2019, given their relationship-based approach to care, as well as their leadership and advocacy roles. Recommendations include the promotion of healthy work environments and prioritizing nurse self-care in alignment with critical care nursing standards. CONCLUSIONS Nurses should focus on a strategic integration of palliative care, critical care, and ethically based care during times of normalcy and of crisis. Primary palliative care should be provided for each patient and family, and specialist services sought, as appropriate. Nurse educators are encouraged to use these recommendations and resources in their curricula and training. Palliative care is critical care. Critical care nurses are the frontline responders capable of translating this holistic, person-centered approach into pragmatic services and relationships throughout the critical care continuum.","Rosa, William E; Ferrell, Betty R; Wiencek, Clareen",Critical care nurse,47,0

The purpose of this study was to present the angioarchitectural and clinical phenotypes of a foramen magnum region AVF from a large, single-center experience. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed cases from a 10-year neurointerventional data base. Arterial and venous angioarchitectural features and clinical presentation were extracted from the medical record. Venous drainage patterns were stratified into 4 groups as follows: type 1 = unrestricted sinus drainage, type 2 = sinus reflux (including the inferior petrosal sinus), type 3 = reflux involving sinuses and cortical veins, and type 4 = restricted cortical vein outflow or perimedullary congestion. RESULTS Twenty-eight patients (mean age, 57.9 years; 57.1% men) had 29 foramen magnum region AVFs. There were 11 (37.9%) type 1, nine (31.0%) type 2, six (20.7%) type 3, and 3 (10.3%) type 4 fistulas. Pulsatile tinnitus was the most frequent symptom (82.1%), followed by orbital symptoms (31.0%), subarachnoid hemorrhage (13.8%), cranial nerve XII palsy (10.3%), and other cranial nerve palsy (6.9%). The most frequent arterial supply was the ipsilateral ascending pharyngeal artery (93.1% ipsilateral, 55.5% contralateral), vertebral artery (89.7%), occipital artery (65.5%), and internal carotid artery branches (48.3%). CONCLUSIONS We present the largest case series of foramen magnum region AVFs to date and show that clinical features relate to angioarchitecture. Orbital symptoms are frequent when sinus reflux is present.

The average contact times were 12 (7,16) and the average cumulative contact time was 2 (1.5,2.7) h.Clinical symptoms of these patients were fever in 23 patients (76.67%) , headache in 16 petients (53.33%) , fatigue or myalgia in 21patients (70%) , nausea, vomiting or diarrhea in 9 petients (30%) , cough in 25 petients (83.33%) , and dyspnea in 14 petients (46.67%) .Routine blood test revealed WBC<4.0×10(9)/L in 8 petients (26.67%) , (4-10) ×10(9)/L in 22 petients (73.33%) , and WBC>4.0×10(9)/L in 4 petients (13.33%) during the disease.Lymphocyte count<1.0×10(9)/L occurred in 12 petients (40%),abnormal liver function in 7 petients (23.33%) ,myocardial damage in 5 petients(16.67%), elevated D-dimer (>0.5mg/l) in 5 patients (16.67%). Compared with normal patients, the average exposure times, cumulative exposure time, BMI, Fever time, white blood cell count, liver enzyme, LDH, myoenzyme and D-dimer were significantly increased in severe patients, while the lymphocyte count and albumin levels in peripheral blood were significantly decreased.Chest CT mainly showed patchy shadows and interstitial changes.According to imaging examination, 11 patients (36.67%) showed Unilateral pneumonia and 19 patients (63.33%) showed bilateral pneumonia,4 patients (13.33%) showed bilateral multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity.Compared with the patients infected in the protected period, the proportion of severe infection and bilateral pneumonia were both increased in the patients infected in unprotected period. Conclusion: Medical staffs are at higher risk of infection.Infection rates are associated with contact time, the amount of suction virus. Severe patients had BMI increased, heating time prolonged, white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, D-dimer and albumin level significantly changed and were prone to be complicated with liver damage and myocardial damage.Strict protection measures is important to prevent infection for medical workers.","Liu, M; He, P; Liu, H G; Wang, X J; Li, F J; Chen, S; Lin, J; Chen, P; Liu, J H; Li, C H",Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases,47,31

The constellation of little public health infrastructure, low levels of health literacy, limited acute care and infection prevention and control resources, densely populated areas, and a highly transmissible and lethal viral infection have led to thousands of confirmed, probable, or suspected cases thus far. Ebola virus disease is characterized by a febrile severe illness with profound gastrointestinal manifestations and is complicated by intravascular volume depletion, shock, profound electrolyte abnormalities, and organ dysfunction. Despite no proven Ebola virus-specific medical therapies, the potential effect of supportive care is great for a condition with high baseline mortality and one usually occurring in resource-constrained settings. With more personnel, basic monitoring, and supportive treatment, many of the sickest patients with Ebola virus disease do not need to die. Ebola virus disease represents an illness ready for a paradigm shift in care delivery and outcomes, and the profession of critical care medicine can and should be instrumental in helping this happen.","Fowler, Robert A; Fletcher, Thomas; Fischer, William A; Lamontagne, Francois; Jacob, Shevin; Brett-Major, David; Lawler, James V; Jacquerioz, Frederique A; Houlihan, Catherine; O'Dempsey, Tim; Ferri, Mauricio; Adachi, Takuya; Lamah, Marie-Claire; Bah, Elhadj Ibrahima; Mayet, Thierry; Schieffelin, John; McLellan, Susan L; Senga, Mikiko; Kato, Yasuyuki; Clement, Christophe; Mardel, Simon; Vallenas Bejar De Villar, Rosa Constanza; Shindo, Nahoko; Bausch, Daniel",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,47,1

STUDY DESIGN Cross-sectional study. METHODS Using billing data from 8 acute care hospitals, we identified 9 principal medical diagnoses from International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes across 4 medical specialties (cardiology, gastroenterology, neurology, and urology). In addition, we defined a combined obstetrical falsification end point. We compared daily admission rates during the pandemic period (3/1/2020-4/30/2020) with the same dates in 2019 (3/1/2019-4/30/2019). As a reference, we also compared a prepandemic period in the same years (1/1/2019-2/28/2019 and 1/1/2020-2/29/2020). We compared admission rates between years using t tests. RESULTS There were 3219 admissions for the conditions of interest during the study period in 2019 and 2661 in 2020. There was no difference in prepandemic daily admission rates in 2020 compared with 2019 (29.04 vs 27.63 admissions per day; -4.9%; P = .50). During the pandemic period, there was a 33.7% decrease in admission rates for all conditions combined in 2020 compared with 2019 (24.68 vs 16.37; -33.7%; P = .03). By specialty, the combined gastroenterology (10.22 vs 7.20; -29.6%; P = .02) and cardiovascular (2.34 vs 1.29; -44.7%; P = .05) end points demonstrated reduction in daily admission rates. CONCLUSIONS Daily admission rates during the COVID-19 pandemic were lower for these acute medical conditions.

A set of five specific primers, two inner and two outer primers and a loop primer, were designed on the basis of the major capsid protein gene of LCDV. The reaction time and temperatures were optimized for 60 min at 63 degrees C, respectively. LAMP amplification products were detected by a ladder-like appearance on agarose gel electrophoresis or a naked-eye inspection of a color change in the reaction tube by addition of SYBR Green I. The assay was specific for LCDV, and there was no cross-reactivity with white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) or six other Iridoviridae viruses (epizootic hematopoietic necrosis virus, EHNV; tiger frog virus, TFV; Bohle iridovirus, BIV; soft-shelled turtle iridovirus, STIV; infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus, ISKNV; red sea bream iridovirus, RSIV). The detection limit of the LAMP assay was 15 fg, which was similar to that of real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and 10-fold higher than the conventional PCR. The LAMP assay was evaluated using 109 clinical samples, and the results indicated the suitability and simplicity of the test as a rapid, field diagnostic tool for detection of LCDV. The LCDV LAMP assay has potential for early diagnosis of LCDV infection.","Li, Qiong; Yue, Zhiqin; Liu, Hong; Liang, Chengzhu; Zheng, Xiaolong; Zhao, Yuran; Chen, Xiao; Xiao, Xizhi; Chen, Changfu",Journal of virological methods,47,1

However, proof of a beneficial effect on functional outcome is lacking. METHODS We randomly assigned eligible patients to either intraarterial treatment plus usual care or usual care alone. Eligible patients had a proximal arterial occlusion in the anterior cerebral circulation that was confirmed on vessel imaging and that could be treated intraarterially within 6 hours after symptom onset. The primary outcome was the modified Rankin scale score at 90 days; this categorical scale measures functional outcome, with scores ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (death). The treatment effect was estimated with ordinal logistic regression as a common odds ratio, adjusted for prespecified prognostic factors. The adjusted common odds ratio measured the likelihood that intraarterial treatment would lead to lower modified Rankin scores, as compared with usual care alone (shift analysis). RESULTS We enrolled 500 patients at 16 medical centers in The Netherlands (233 assigned to intraarterial treatment and 267 to usual care alone). The mean age was 65 years (range, 23 to 96), and 445 patients (89.0%) were treated with intravenous alteplase before randomization. Retrievable stents were used in 190 of the 233 patients (81.5%) assigned to intraarterial treatment. The adjusted common odds ratio was 1.67 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.21 to 2.30). There was an absolute difference of 13.5 percentage points (95% CI, 5.9 to 21.2) in the rate of functional independence (modified Rankin score, 0 to 2) in favor of the intervention (32.6% vs. 19.1%). There were no significant differences in mortality or the occurrence of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS In patients with acute ischemic stroke caused by a proximal intracranial occlusion of the anterior circulation, intraarterial treatment administered within 6 hours after stroke onset was effective and safe.

However, the reusables clearly offer two other important benefits, lower annual cost and lower environmental impact. The objectives of this paper are to now provide quantitative reusable product benefits on a U.S. national environmental and economic basis. This is the first quantitative, novel multi-user economic evaluation of selecting cleanroom reusables over disposables. For personal protection equipment (PPE), these cost and environmental-benefits indicate there is also an improved environmental and economic aspect to the increased national demand for reusables related to Covid-19, while easily achieving necessary cleaning with approved detergents. The current reusable cleanroom market (14.1 million packages) was estimated to be 60% nonsterile and 40% sterilized. The total market is about 50% reusable and 50% disposable. This research documents there is an annual cost reduction of about 58% when selecting reusables over disposables giving an economic savings to the U.S. cleanroom sector from reusables of about $1.2 billion in the next decade. This is also saving the total U.S. about 136 million MJ natural resource energy/year (38 million kWh) and about 8.4 million kg CO2eq annually (removal of about 1,650 cars/yr). In a maximum hypothetical case for reusables at 87.5% of the market (12.5% are mandatory Hazmat disposable) would yield a U.S. national savings of nearly $2.1 billion/decade to the cleanroom sector bottom line, as well as 2.4 billion MJ nre savings in energy or removal of about 29,000 cars/decade. These results indicate there are effective, verifiable, and easily obtained environmental and economic benefits by the basic transition by diverse cleanrooms in deciding to select reusable garments.","Overcash, Michael; Griffing, Evan",PDA journal of pharmaceutical science and technology,47,19

METHODS Perioperative variables were reviewed in 21 patients who underwent LDLLT at our institution. Recipients were kept intubated for at least two d after LDLLT to maintain optimal expansion of the implanted lobes. Subsequently, if weaning from artificial ventilation could be tolerated, extubation was considered with the assistance of non-invasive ventilation (NIV). If this could not be tolerated, early tracheostomy was considered. RESULTS All 21 recipients were weaned from artificial ventilation. Twelve patients underwent tracheotomy 4.4 ± 1.8 d after LDLLT and were weaned from artificial ventilation 24.3 ± 17.0 d after LDLLT. Eleven patients were extubated 3.6 ± 1.7 d after LDLLT with NIV, but two of them were reintubated, and finally weaned from artificial ventilation via tracheostomy. Excluding these two patients, NIV was required for 3.8 ± 3.9 d after extubation. The early postoperative course was significantly eventful in patients with tracheostomies, and artificial ventilation, ventilatory support, and intensive care unit stays were longer. Twenty patients (95%) showed survival at 24.4 ± 13.4 months of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Postoperative respiratory management with NIV and early tracheostomy were useful after LDLLT.","Chen, Fengshi; Chin, Kazuo; Sato, Masaaki; Aoyama, Akihiro; Murase, Kimihiko; Azuma, Masanori; Bando, Toru; Date, Hiroshi",Clinical transplantation,47,1

In this study, we identified the activating receptor NKp46 (CD335) in swine with newly developed monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for more detailed studies on NK cells in this species. The NKp46 mAbs showed a specific reactivity with a distinct population of perforin(+) CD2(+) CD3(-) CD8α(+) CD16(+) lymphocytes. In spleen and liver, an additional subset of CD8α(dim/-) lymphocytes with increased NKp46 expression was observed. Surprisingly, we could identify NKp46(-) cells with an NK cell phenotype in all animals analyzed. These lymphocytes showed comparable cytolytic activity against xenogeneic and allogeneic target cells as NKp46(+) NK cells. In contrast, NKp46(+) NK cells produced several fold higher levels of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) than the NKp46(-) cells after cytokine stimulation. Furthermore, an activation-dependent induction of NKp46 expression in formerly NKp46(-) cells after stimulation with interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-12, and IL-18 could be shown. In summary, our data indicate that NKp46 is not expressed by all porcine NK cells and that NKp46 discriminates porcine NK cells differing in regard to cytokine production, which challenges the paradigm of NKp46 as a comprehensive marker for NK cells across different mammalian species.","Mair, Kerstin H; Essler, Sabine E; Patzl, Martina; Storset, Anne K; Saalmüller, Armin; Gerner, Wilhelm",European journal of immunology,47,19

METHODS We conducted searches in Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from January 1960 to August 2019 to identify observational studies that examined the association between SRCs and any aortic diseases, including aortic aneurysms and dissection. Two reviewers independently extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias. The meta-analysis was performed by STATA 14.1. RESULTS In total, 11 observational studies with 19 719 participants were included in this meta-analysis. Compared to individuals without SRCs, patients with SRCs had higher odds of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) (adjusted OR = 2.61, 95% CI 2.34-2.91, P < 0.001, I2 = 0%), ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) (adjusted OR = 1.98, 95% CI 1.09-3.63, P = 0.03, I2 = 90.1%), descending TAA (adjusted OR = 3.44, 95% CI, 2.67-4.43, P < 0.001, I2 = 0%), type A aortic dissection (AD) (adjusted OR = 1.98, 95% CI 1.32-2.96, P = 0.001, I2 = 12.9%), and type B AD (adjusted OR = 2.55, 95% CI, 1.31-4.96, P = 0.006, I2 = 76.2%).

MATERIALS AND METHODS Between July 2009 and April 2013, we treated 200 clinically localized prostate cancer patients with high-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy±intensity modulated radiation therapy. Half of the patients received a transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided transperineal injection of 10mL PEG hydrogel (DuraSeal™ Spinal Sealant System; Covidien, Mansfield, MA) in their anterior perirectal fat immediately prior to the first HDR brachytherapy treatment and 5mL PEG hydrogel prior to the second HDR brachytherapy treatment. Prostate, rectal, and bladder doses and prostate-rectal distances were calculated based upon treatment planning CT scans. RESULTS There was a success rate of 100% (100/100) with PEG hydrogel implantation. PEG hydrogel significantly increased the prostate-rectal separation (mean±SD, 12±4mm with gel vs. 4±2mm without gel, p<0.001) and significantly decreased the mean rectal D2 mL (47±9% with gel vs. 60±8% without gel, p<0.001). Gel decreased rectal doses regardless of body mass index (BMI). CONCLUSIONS PEG hydrogel temporarily displaced the rectum away from the prostate by an average of 12mm and led to a significant reduction in rectal radiation doses, regardless of BMI.","Strom, Tobin J; Wilder, Richard B; Fernandez, Daniel C; Mellon, Eric A; Saini, Amarjit S; Hunt, Dylan C; Pow-Sang, Julio M; Spiess, Phillipe E; Sexton, Wade J; Poch, Michael A; Biagioli, Matthew C",Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology,47,17

As a result, surge models that rely on case counts to forecast hospital demand may be inaccurately influencing policy and decision-maker action. OBJECTIVE Based on SARS-CoV-2 prevalence data derived from a statewide random sample (as opposed to relying on reported case counts), we determine the infection-hospitalization ratio (IHR), defined as the percentage of infected individuals who are hospitalized, for various demographic groups in Indiana. Furthermore, for comparison, we show the extent to which case-based hospitalization ratios, compared with the IHR, overestimate the probability of hospitalization by demographic group. DESIGN Secondary analysis of statewide prevalence data from Indiana, COVID-19 hospitalization data extracted from a statewide health information exchange, and all reported COVID-19 cases to the state health department. SETTING State of Indiana as of April 30, 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Demographic-stratified IHRs and case-hospitalization ratios. RESULTS The overall IHR was 2.1% and varied more by age than by race or sex. Infection-hospitalization ratio estimates ranged from 0.4% for those younger than 40 years to 9.2% for those older than 60 years. Hospitalization rates based on case counts overestimated the IHR by a factor of 10, but this overestimation differed by demographic groups, especially age. CONCLUSIONS In this first study of the IHR based on population prevalence, our results can improve forecasting models of hospital demand-especially in preparation for the upcoming winter period when an increase in SARS CoV-2 infections is expected.","Menachemi, Nir; Dixon, Brian E; Wools-Kaloustian, Kara K; Yiannoutsos, Constantin T; Halverson, Paul K",Journal of public health management and practice : JPHMP,47,1

The protocol is built on the foundation of low-tidal-volume ventilation, use of a combined PEEP and F(IO(2)) table, and managing alveolar end-inspiratory pressure by limiting the plateau airway pressure to ≤ 30 cm H(2)O. Although this strategy, to date, is the only method that significantly improves ALI/ARDS survival, alternative methods of improving hypoxemia and minimizing ventilator-induced lung injury, in conjunction with low-tidal-volume ventilation, can be used for life-threatening ARDS. We present a case in which we customized the use of alveolar recruitment maneuvers by analyzing the hysteresis of the pressure-volume curve to assess lung recruitability, decremental PEEP to sustain lung recruitment, and careful use of plateau pressure ≥ 30 cm H(2)O, which improved our patient's life-threatening hypoxemia within the first 36 min of arrival to our ICU.","Grooms, David A; Sibole, Stephen H; Tomlinson, James R; Marik, Paul E; Chatburn, Robert L",Respiratory care,47,16

As a result, in North America and elsewhere, older adults have been strongly advised to shelter in place. Older adults also represent the fastest growing segment of licensed drivers. OBJECTIVE We examined the change in injuries and fatalities sustained by younger and older drivers and pedestrians during the first month of the COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesized that adults ages 80 years and over would have a proportionally larger reduction than the other drivers and pedestrians. METHODS Using a cohort design, we compared the proportion of drivers and pedestrians involved in injuries and fatalities attributable to individuals aged 80 years and over, as recorded in the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (Canada) database, between the 30 days prior to shelter-in-place related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent 30 days. By way of comparison, we conducted a similar comparison for younger age cohorts (16-24 years, 25-34 years, 35-54 years, 55-64 years, and 65-79 years). RESULTS Drivers aged 80 years and over represented 21 per 1000 injuries and fatalities in the 30 days prior to March 17, 2020 (95 % CI: 15-29), and 8 per 1000 injuries and fatalities in the 30 days beginning on that date (95 % CI: 2-20), a 64.7 % reduction (exp (β) post 0.353, 95 % CI 0.105-0.892). Drivers in the 35-54 year age range underwent a significant but smaller reduction of 22.9 %; no significant changes were seen for drivers in other age groups, or for pedestrians of any age. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The physical distancing measures that aimed to reduce the spread of COVID-19 resulted in a marked reduction in driver injuries and fatalities in the oldest old, illustrating the impact of physical distancing recommendations in this population. The excess mortality burden faced by the oldest adults during the COVID-19 pandemic, by direct exposure to the virus, may be indirectly mitigated by the reduction in road-related deaths in this cohort.","Rapoport, Mark J; Chee, Justin N; Aljenabi, Nadia; Byrne, Patrick A; Naglie, Gary; Ilari, Frances; Elzohairy, Yoassry; Vingilis, Evelyn; Mulsant, Benoit H",Accident; analysis and prevention,47,16

The purpose of this paper was to present our initial experience of enterotomy closure with barbed sutures in upper gastrointestinal and bariatric surgeries, and share optimal technique of using such sutures for enterotomy closure. METHODS Fifty patients who underwent laparoscopic closure of enterotomies using barbed sutures were identified in two institutions in Singapore from January 2012 to December 2013. Patient demographics, short-term operative outcomes including anastomotic time, onset of diet, hospital stay, and early post-operative complications are reported. RESULTS In 50 patients a total of 62 anastomotic sites were closed with barbed sutures. The barbed sutures appear to reduce mean anastomotic suturing time of the Roux-en-Y gastrojejunal closure (17.34 vs 44.55 min, p value 0.0001) and jejunojejunal closure (19.46 vs 31.01 min, p value 0.0013) when compared to a subgroup of patients with the same anastomotic sites closed using the standard non-barbed suture. The mean onset to start on diet was 2 ± 1.5 days and mean duration of hospital stay is 7 + 5.3 days. One (1.6%) anastomotic leak was observed day 3 after a gastric bypass in the series. This leak was the result of a technical error due to inappropriate suturing technique. There were no mortalities, other complications or readmission. While applying traction on the suture brings two tissue edges closer, we observed that pushing the tissues toward each other provided more apposition and prevented unnecessary tearing of tissues that could potentially result in complications CONCLUSIONS Barbed closure sutures appear to be safe and effective in laparoscopic upper gastrointestinal procedures for closing enterotomies provided appropriate technique is used. The potential benefit is simplifying intracorporeal enterotomy closure.","Bautista, Therese; Shabbir, Asim; Rao, Jaideepraj; So, Jimmy; Kono, Koji; Durai, Pradeep",Surgical endoscopy,47,24

The most likely role of this layer is to prevent the creation of overlapping suture lines. Many hypospadias surgeons use a dartos fascia interposition flap for this purpose. However, raising a dartos fascia flap adds time to the procedure, can result in devascularization of the overlying skin, and can create unsightly torsion of the penis, which may be hard to correct. To avoid these problems, the senior author has started to use dCELL (decellularized human dermis) as an alternative to dartos fascia to separate the suture lines. Methods Between March and July 2018, a pilot study was performed in 8 patients undergoing closure of a urethrocutaneous fistula or glans dehiscence combined with dCELL. Data on infections, wound breakdown, length of stay and catheterization, surgical time, and hospital stay were collected. Results All patients had a successful reconstruction. One patient developed a urinary tract infection, possibly related to prolonged catheterization following his repair. Conclusion Our results suggest that dCELL may be useful in the repair of urethrocutaneous fistulas and glans dehiscence after hypospadias surgery.","Naderi, Naghmeh; Joji, Nikita; Venantius Kang, Norbert",Plastic and reconstructive surgery.

Scenarios are integral to the international standard for usability engineering of medical devices (IEC 62366:2007), and are also applied to the development of health software (draft standard IEC 82304-1). The 62366 standard lays out a process for mitigating risk during normal use (i.e. use as per the instructions, or accepted medical practice). However, this begs the question of whether ""real use"" (that which occurs in practice) matches ""normal use"". In this paper, we present an overview of the product lifecycle and how it impacts on the type of scenario that can be practically applied. We report on the development and testing of a set of scenarios intended to inform the design of infusion pumps based on ""real use"". The scenarios were validated by researchers and practitioners experienced in clinical practice, and their utility was assessed by developers and practitioners representing different stages of the product lifecycle. These evaluations highlighted previously unreported challenges and opportunities for the use of scenarios in this context. Challenges include: integrating scenario-based design with usability engineering practice; covering the breadth of uses of infusion devices; and managing contradictory evidence. Opportunities included scenario use beyond design to guide marketing, to inform purchasing and as resources for training staff.

Some versions are being specifically designed and tested in patients with osteosarcoma, though due to their generalized mechanism of action most are being tested in patients across a broad range of cancer types. The activity of these viruses is impacted not only by the susceptibility of tumor cells to infection but also by the tumor microenvironment (TME) and by tumor immunogenicity. Here we review the field of oncolytic viruses with a particular emphasis on highlighting any available data in preclinical osteosarcoma models or in patients with osteosarcoma. While in general the viruses have been shown safe to administer to patients by a variety of routes, their therapeutic efficacy to date has been limited. Given the low rate of adverse events and the likely absence of long-term side effects, the utility of oncolytic viruses will most likely be realized when used in combination with other agents.","Wedekind, Mary Frances; Cripe, Timothy P",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,47,1

The molecular mechanisms by which combinations of mutations, especially those remote from the active site, alter drug binding to confer resistance are poorly understood and thus difficult to counteract. A machine learning strategy was developed that coupled parallel molecular dynamics simulations with experimental potency to identify specific conserved mechanisms underlying resistance. Physical features were extracted from the simulations, analyzed, and integrated into one consistent and interpretable elastic network model. To rigorously test this strategy, HIV-1 protease variants with diverse mutations were used, with potencies ranging from picomolar to micromolar to the drug darunavir. Feature reduction resulted in a model with four specific features that predicts for both the training and test sets inhibitor binding free energy within 1 kcal/mol of the experimental value over this entire range of potency. These predictive features are physically interpretable, as they vary specifically with affinity and diagonally transverse across the protease homodimer. This physics-based strategy of parallel molecular dynamics and machine learning captures mechanisms by which complex combinations of mutations confer resistance and identify critical features that serve as bellwethers of affinity, which will be critical in future drug design.","Leidner, Florian; Kurt Yilmaz, Nese; Schiffer, Celia A",Journal of chemical theory and computation,47,1

In this paper, we summarize the current evidence to answer the common questions raised by clinicians about this new aerosol delivery route and best practices of administration. Benefits of trans-nasal aerosol delivery include increased comfort, ability to speak, eat, and drink for patients while meeting a range of oxygen requirements, particularly for those who need to inhale aerosolized medication for long periods. Aerosol administration via HFNC has been shown to be well tolerated by children and adults, with comparable or better delivery efficacy than other interfaces, ranging from 2-20%. In vitro and in vivo scintigraphy studies among pediatric and adult populations reported that the inhaled dose delivered via a vibrating mesh nebulizer is 2 to 3 fold greater than that via a jet nebulizer. For adults, placement of nebulizer at the inlet of humidifier increases inhaled dose while reducing rainout obstructing nasal prongs. When HFNC gas flow is set below patient inspiratory flow, aerosol deposition is higher than when the gas flow exceeds patient inspiratory flow; thus, if tolerated, titrating down HFNC gas flow during trans-nasal aerosol delivery, with close monitoring and the use of unit dose with high concentration are recommended. Trans-nasal pulmonary aerosol delivery has not been shown to increase bioaerosols generated by patients, but gas flow may disperse aerosols. Placement of a surgical or procedure mask over HFNC might reduce aerosol dispersion.","Li, Jie; Fink, James B",Annals of translational medicine,47,31

IgM and IgG-based serological detection methods are the most common approaches used for laboratory diagnosis of hantaviruses. Such emerging viral pathogens emphasizes the need for improved rapid diagnostic devices and vaccines incorporating pan-specific epitopes of genotypes. We predicted linear B-cell epitopes for hantaviruses that are specific to genotypes causing HCPS in humans using in silico prediction servers. We modeled the Andes and Sin Nombre hantavirus nucleocapsid protein to locate the identified epitopes. Based on the mean percent prediction probability score, epitope IMASKSVGS/TAEEKLKKKSAF was identified as the best candidate B-cell epitope specific for hantaviruses causing HCPS.

Participants were randomly assigned into three groups; Intervention 1 (two 30-min massages at the effective point of pain for each sole), intervention 2 (one 30-min massage at the effective point of pain and one 30-min massage at the heel for each sole), and control (two 30-minute heel massages). Massage was performed once in 4-cm dilatation and the second time in 7-cm dilatation. The severity of pain and childbirth experience were measured by Visual Analogue Scale and Labor Agentry Scale, respectively. Partograph chart was used to measure the length of labor stages. RESULTS The severity of pain in intervention group 1 was significantly lower than the control group (AMD: -1.7; 9% confidence interval: -2.8 to -0.6; p = 0.001), but there was no significant difference between intervention groups 1 and 2 (p = 0.066) and intervention group 2 and control (p = 0.336).

First, an algorithmic approach partitions each country or state's COVID-19 time series into a first wave and subsequent period. Next, offsets between case and death time series are learned for each country via a normalized inner product. Combining these with additional calculations, we can determine which countries have most substantially reduced the mortality rate of COVID-19. Finally, our paper identifies similarities in the trajectories of cases and deaths for European countries and U.S. states. Our analysis refines the popular conception that the mortality rate has greatly decreased throughout Europe during its second wave of COVID-19; instead, we demonstrate substantial heterogeneity throughout Europe and the U.S. The Netherlands exhibited the largest reduction of mortality, a factor of 16, followed by Denmark, France, Belgium, and other Western European countries, greater than both Eastern European countries and U.S. states. Some structural similarity is observed between Europe and the United States, in which Northeastern states have been the most successful in the country. Such analysis may help European countries learn from each other's experiences and differing successes to develop the best policies to combat COVID-19 as a collective unit.","James, Nick; Menzies, Max; Radchenko, Peter",Chaos,47,21

This is most apparent when caregivers face high levels of stress or life adversity. To study this phenomenon in the current global context, this study examined the relation between stress/disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic and the mental health of female and male caregivers. Pre-pandemic childhood adversity was considered as a moderator of this association. A multi-national sample (United Kingdom, 76%; United States, 19%; Canada, 4%, and Australia, 1%) was recruited in May 2020, of whom 348 female and 143 male caregivers of 5-18 year-old children provided data on the constructs of interest. At this time, caregivers reported on their history of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and COVID stress/disruption. About two months later (July 2020) caregiver mental health was evaluated. We examined differences between female and male caregivers on ACEs, COVID stress/disruption, and mental health (distress, anxiety, substance use, and posttraumatic stress). Main and interactive effects of ACEs and COVID stress/disruption on each mental health outcome were examined. Female caregivers reported higher COVID stress/disruption, more ACEs, and greater distress, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress symptoms compared to male caregivers. Among female caregivers, higher COVID stress/disruption and more adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) independently predicted all mental health outcomes, consistent with a stress accumulation model. Among male caregivers, a pattern of interactions between COVID stress/disruption and ACEs suggested that the effects of COVID stress/disruption on mental health was stronger for those with higher ACEs, especially for substance use, consistent with a stress sensitization model. Higher levels of stress and mental health difficulties among female caregivers suggests a disproportionate burden due to pandemic-related disruption compared to male caregivers. Findings speak to the disparate effects of COVID-19 on the mental health of female compared to male caregivers, and the role of pre-existing vulnerabilities in shaping current adaptation.","Wade, Mark; Prime, Heather; Johnson, Dylan; May, Shealyn S; Jenkins, Jennifer M; Browne, Dillon T",Social science & medicine,47,10

However, there is little understanding of how urban growth in these regional towns will impact urban runoff. We used the case study of Wangaratta, located in South-East Australia, between 2006 and 2016, to investigate land cover changes and their impacts on urban runoff discharge. Detailed spatio-temporal analysis (including neighbourhood composition analysis and supervised classification of aerial imagery) identified that population, land use and land cover changes in Wangaratta, although subtle, were mostly driven by residential growth in the outskirts of the town, where there were large increases in impervious surface area. Overall, the urban growth was minimal. However, in spite of these small changes, a sub-catchment only SWMM model showed that the increase in impervious surface area nevertheless resulted in a statistically significant increase in total runoff across the town. Particularly, this increase was most pronounced for frequent and shorter storms. The analysis of urban development pattern changes coupled with urban hydrological modelling indicated that land cover changes in regional towns, especially when analysed in detail, may result in hydrological changes in the urban region (likely to be exacerbated in coming years by changing climate) and that adaptation efforts will need to adopt a variety of approaches in both existing and growth zones. Our findings highlight the necessity of detailed fine-scale analyses in small towns as even subtle changes will have substantial future implications and robust planning and adaptation decisions are even more important when compared to larger cities due to the greater economic constraints that small towns face and their important relationship with the surrounding hinterlands.","Browne, Spencer; Lintern, Anna; Jamali, Behzad; Leitão, João P; Bach, Peter M",The Science of the total environment,47,1

OBJECTIVES The objective of this study was to determine the relation of ApoA-IV with changes in glucose metabolism and weight after bariatric surgery. SETTING University Hospital. METHODS The patients (n = 49) included lean controls (n = 8) and patients before and after a mean of 7 months after laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB, n = 12), laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB, n = 22), or laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG, n = 11). ApoA-IV and other hormone assays were performed in the fasting and the postprandial state. Pearson's correlation analyses controlled for baseline BMI and percent excess weight loss (EWL) were used to determine relationships between ApoA-IV levels and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). RESULTS With all bariatric procedures combined, the change in ApoA-IV [533 versus 518 microg/L, P = .813] or ApoA-IV area under the curve (AUC - 1072 versus 1042, P = .939) was not significant. None of the surgeries individually affected levels of fasting or ApoA-IV AUC. Bariatric surgery resulted in a decrease in HOMA-IR (5.3 versus 2.0, P<.001). In the RYGB group, higher baseline ApoA-IV levels correlated with decrease in HOMA-IR [r = -.6, P = .008]. This relationship was independent of EWL and was not observed in the LAGB or SG group. There was no association of ApoA-IV levels with EWL, insulin secretion, Peptide-YY, or leptin levels. CONCLUSION Preoperative ApoA-IV levels, rather than changes in levels, positively correlate with improvements in insulin sensitivity independent of weight loss after RYGB.","Rao, Raghavendra; Roche, Alexander; Febres, Gerardo; Bessler, Marc; Tso, Patrick; Korner, Judith",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,47,1

The 2020 China COVID-19 Survey was administered anonymously via social media (WeChat). It was completed by 10 545 adults in all of mainland China's 31 provinces. The survey consisted of 74 items covering sociodemographic characteristics, preventive measures for COVID-19, lifestyle behaviors, and health-related outcomes during the period of quarantine. Regression models examined associations among study variables. Diabetes was associated with a six-fold increased risk of reporting COVID-19 infection among respondents or their family members. Among people with diabetes, individuals who rarely wore masks had double the risk of suspected COVID-19 infection compared with those who always wore masks, with an inverse J-shaped relationship between face mask wearing and suspected COVID-19 infection. People with diabetes tended to have both poor knowledge of COVID-19 and poor compliance with preventive measures, despite perceiving a high risk of personal infection (40.0% among respondents reporting diabetes and 8.0% without diabetes). Only 54-55% of these respondents claimed to consistently practice preventive measures, including wearing face masks. Almost 60% of those with diabetes experienced food or medication shortages during the quarantine period, which was much higher than those without diabetes. Importantly, respondents who experienced medication shortages reported a 63% higher COVID-19 infection rate. Diabetes was associated with an increased risk of self-reported personal and family member COVID-19 infection, which is mitigated by consistent use of face masks.","Shi, Zumin; Yan, Alice; Zimmet, Paul; Sun, Xiaoming; Cristina do Vale Moreira, Nayla; Cheskin, Lawrence J; Wang, Liming; Qu, Weidong; Yan, Hong; Hussain, Akhtar; Wang, Youfa",Hormone and metabolic research = Hormon- und Stoffwechselforschung = Hormones et metabolisme,47,29

Single-incision laparoscopic (SIL) surgery, the most recent development in minimally invasive surgery, allows operations to be carried out through only a single incision using special ports. SIL surgery combines in part the cosmetic advantage and decreases the parietal trauma of natural orifice surgery, but allows operative realisation with standard and validated laparoscopic instruments. We report here the feasibility and surgical technique of a transumbilical SIL sigmoidectomy. INDICATION We describe a 40-year-old man (BMI 30 kg/m2) with previously documented diverticular abscess and recurrent diverticulitis. METHOD The multichannel 50-mm single port (OCTO-Port®, AFS Medical, Austria) was placed at the umbilicus. Transumbilical SIL sigmoidectomy was feasible with conventional laparoscopic instruments. Operative time for SIL sigmoidectomy was 159 min. A total of 25 cm sigmoid was resected. Oral diet was resumed on postoperative day one. No intraoperative or postoperative complications were recorded. The patient convalesced without complication and went home 6 days after surgery. At the 1-month review, he was fully recovered and his single umbilical scar was well healed. CONCLUSION Transumbilical SIL sigmoidectomy is feasible by experienced laparoscopic surgeons using conventional laparoscopic instruments and staplers. Further studies are certainly warranted for this promising technique. It has to be determined whether SIL offers benefit to the patient, besides cosmesis, compared with standard laparoscopic sigmoidectomy.","Mittermair, R; Pratschke, J; Sucher, R",Zentralblatt fur Chirurgie,47,31

Despite the fact that data on the safety of IOM are available, the significance and predictive value of the procedure are still under discussion. Moreover, cases of false-negative monitoring affect the surgeon's confidence in IOM. OBJECTIVE To examine cases of false-negative IOM to reveal structural explanations. METHODS Between 2007 and 2010, we resected 115 consecutive supratentorial gliomas in or close to eloquent motor areas using direct cortical stimulation for monitoring of motor evoked potentials (MEPs). The monitoring data were reviewed and related to new postoperative motor deficit and postoperative imaging. Clinical outcomes were assessed during follow-up. RESULTS Monitoring of MEPs was successful in 112 cases (97.4%). Postoperatively, 30.3% of patients had a new motor deficit, which remained permanent in 12.5%. Progression-free follow-up was 9.7 months (range, 2 weeks-40.6 months). In 65.2% of all cases, MEPs were stable throughout the operation, but 8.9% showed a new temporary motor deficit, whereas 4.5% (5 patients) presented with permanently deteriorated motor function representing false-negative monitoring at first glance. However, these cases were caused by secondary hemorrhage, ischemia, or resection of the supplementary motor area. CONCLUSION Continuous MEP monitoring provides reliable monitoring of the motor system, influences the course of operation in some cases, and has to be regarded as the standard for IOM of the motor system. In our series, we found no false-negative MEP results.","Krieg, Sandro M; Shiban, Ehab; Droese, Doris; Gempt, Jens; Buchmann, Niels; Pape, Haiko; Ryang, Yu-Mi; Meyer, Bernhard; Ringel, Florian",Neurosurgery,47,1

Historically in the UK, the high-risk regimens used have been M-EA (Sheffield) and EMA-CO (Charing Cross, London) with prior published data suggesting no difference in survival between these. Our Sheffield treatment policy changed in 2014, switching from M-EA to EMA-CO, aiming to reduce time in hospital, and harmonise UK practice. We aimed to report the toxicities, response rates and survival outcomes for 79 patients with high-risk GTN treated in the first-line setting with either M-EA (n=59) or EMA-CO (n=20) from 1998-2018. Median duration of treatment was similar (M-EA, 17.3 weeks (IQR 13.9-22.6) and 17.6 weeks (IQR 13.4-20.7) with EMA-CO. For M-EA, overall hCG complete response (CR) rate was 84.7% (n=50/59). 2 patients died of drug-resistant disease after several lines of multi-agent chemotherapy; overall survival is 96.6% (median follow-up 10.4 years). For EMA-CO, overall hCG CR rate was 70%, overall survival is 100% (median follow-up 4 years). In our experience, patients treated with EMA-CO experienced an apparent increased incidence of neutropenia, non-neutropenic grade 3-4 infection, peripheral neuropathy and more treatment delays and nights in hospital. GCSF, after both EMA and CO arms, titrated to baseline neutrophil count improved the toxicity profile. Both treatment regimens are associated with excellent prognosis; selection of regimen may be further guided by individual patients' personal, social and family circumstances. There is further rationale to explore whether these regimens can be refined, such as 2-weekly EMA, to optimise patient experience and reduce toxicity while maintaining efficacy.

To elucidate responses to early HIV-1 replication, we studied blood pDCs in 29 HIV-infected participants who initiated antiretroviral therapy during acute infection and underwent analytic treatment interruption (ATI). An increased frequency of partially activated pDCs was observed in the blood prior to detection of HIV RNA. Concurrent with peak pDC frequency, there was a transient decline in the ability of pDCs to produce IFNα in vitro, which correlated with decreased interferon regulatory factory 7 (IRF7) and NF-kB phosphorylation. Levels of phosphorylated IRF7 and NF-kB inversely correlated with plasma IFNα2 levels, implying that pDCs were refractory to in vitro stimulation after IFNα production in vivo. After ATI, decreased expression of IFN genes in pDCs inversely correlated with time to viral detection, suggesting that pDC IFN loss is part of an effective early immune response. These data, from a limited cohort, provide a critical first step in understanding the earliest immune response to HIV-1 and suggest that changes in blood pDC frequency and function can be used as an indicator of viral replication before detectable plasma viremia.","Mitchell, Julie L; Takata, Hiroshi; Muir, Roshell; Colby, Donn J; Kroon, Eugene; Crowell, Trevor A; Sacdalan, Carlo; Pinyakorn, Suteeraporn; Pattamaswin, Suwanna; Benjapornpong, Khunthalee; Trichavaroj, Rapee; Tressler, Randall L; Fox, Lawrence; Polonis, Victoria R; Bolton, Diane L; Maldarelli, Frank; Lewin, Sharon R; Haddad, Elias K; Phanuphak, Praphan; Robb, Merlin L; Michael, Nelson L; de Souza, Mark; Phanuphak, Nittaya; Ananworanich, Jintanat; Trautmann, Lydie",The Journal of clinical investigation,47,1

Sixty-six therapists completed a survey about their experiences of delivering therapy via video. RESULTS The lockdown in March 2020 precipitated a dramatic shift from face-to-face to telephone and video-delivered sessions. Most clinicians (89%) found video-based sessions acceptable. Barriers to effective delivery included technological issues, problems with online platforms, and feeling more tired after sessions. Benefits included generalised learning from behavioural work, improvements in efficiency and in the therapeutic relationship, particularly in comparison with telephone-based sessions. Tutorials and support guides were recommended to maximise use of sessions via video. CONCLUSIONS Video-delivered therapy was liked by clinicians and preferred to telephone-based sessions.

Accordingly, the authors initiated a survey among the major poultry producers in Hungary in order to reveal the prevailing IBV serotypes in the country. Tracheal swabs and organ samples (caecal tonsils, kidneys, and trachea) were collected from broiler, layer, and meat-type breeder flocks, and were subjected to IBV detection by virus isolation and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The IBV-positive samples were further characterised by nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of a portion of the S1 IBV gene. Seventeen out of the 26 submitted samples proved to be positive for IBV. Sequence analyses revealed ten 4/91 and six QX serotypes, and a single D274 type IB virus. One sample contained a mixture of QX and Massachusetts serotype viruses. Presumably most of the 4/91 and D274 type viruses were vaccine strains. The proportion of QX type viruses and their observed variation are in good agreement with the situation in a few other European countries. The detected viruses clustered largely according to their geographic origin, with a few exceptions. If updated regularly, the preliminary 'virus map' will be useful for the adjustment of vaccination protocols.","Kiss, István; Mató, Tamás; Homonnay, Zalán G; Kojer, Judit; Farsang, Attila; Bálint, Ádám; Palya, Vilmos",Acta veterinaria Hungarica,47,1

To emulate general practice, allowing multiple encounters with a single patient, a new longitudinal virtual patient (LVP) was developed. METHODS The LVP was integrated into 2nd year at a graduate-entry medical school, in the 2019/2020 academic year. Students were asked about their prior experience and expectations of LVPs, before they engaged with two consultations and one results session. Data were collected from this survey and from the engagement with the LVP. Feedback was collected and thematically grouped. RESULTS Survey responses indicated that 1.7% (2/120) had previous experience with virtual patients, and the majority expected the LVP to make a difference to their clinical reasoning. Out of the 142 students engaged with the LVP, 53% completed over 75% of the work. Informal feedback arose around accessibility, professional learning and development, and engagement with the LVP module. DISCUSSION The data indicate that LVPs are agreeable to medical students, with good engagement and positive reports of clinical learning.

METHODS We used data from a population-based cohort comprising 66 820 older (≥65 years) participants with a follow-up period from 1998 to 2012. The impact of influenza activity on respiratory mortality rates was estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for comorbidities, meteorological factors, and other co-circulating respiratory viruses. We also tested whether the association of influenza with respiratory mortality varied with obesity and/or health status. As a control outcome, we similarly assessed the association of influenza with deaths from external causes, because these deaths should be unrelated to influenza. RESULTS Seasonal influenza activity was associated with higher respiratory mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.13 for influenza activity in the influenza season vs noninfluenza season; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-1.22). The effect of seasonal influenza was 19% greater in obese individuals than normal-weight individuals (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.01-1.42). The marginally significant and greater effect modification of obesity status on the association between seasonal influenza and respiratory mortality was also observed among older people in good health (HR, 1.35; 95% CI, .97-1.87). No such relations were observed for death from external causes. CONCLUSIONS Obesity aggravates the effect of seasonal influenza on respiratory mortality. Priority for influenza vaccine should be considered for obese older people to decrease the burden of influenza.","Zhou, Ying; Cowling, Benjamin J; Wu, Peng; Chan, Wai Man; Lee, Siu Yin; Lau, Eric H Y; Schooling, C Mary",Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,47,31

A less well-studied aspect of school calendars that influences disease dynamics is that all children enter school on the same day each year. Rather than a continuous inflow, there is a sudden increase in the number of susceptible individuals in schools at the start of the school year. Based on the standard susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model, we show that school cohort entry alone is sufficient to generate a biennial epidemic pattern, similar to many observed time series of measles incidence. In addition, cohort entry causes an annual decline in the effective transmission that is evident in observed time series, but not in models without the cohort effect. Including both cohort entry and school terms yields a model fit that is significantly closer to observed measles data than is obtained with either cohort entry or school terms alone (and just as good as that obtained with Schenzle's realistic age-structured model). Nevertheless, we find that the bifurcation structure of the periodically forced SEIR model is nearly identical, regardless of whether forcing arises from cohort entry, school terms and any combination of the two. Thus, while detailed time-series fits are substantially improved by including both cohort entry and school terms, the overall qualitative dynamic structure of the SEIR model appears to be insensitive to the origin of periodic forcing.","He, Daihai; Earn, David J D","Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",47,19

We performed Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression to determine survival times and independent predictors of mortality. RESULTS A total of 324 patients were included. Seventy-seven patients (23.8%) had acute myocardial injury. The primary outcome measure, namely death, occurred in 54.5% and 3.2% of the patients with and without myocardial injury, respectively. Notably, 75.3% of the patients with myocardial injury and 6.5% of the patients without myocardial injury developed ARDS. Overall, 50 out of 324 patients (15.4%) died during the study period. The mortality rate was 54.5% in patients with myocardial injury and 3.2% in patients without myocardial injury. Mean survival times were significantly different between the groups (15.1±0.9 days in patients with myocardial injury and 24.4±0.7 days in patients without myocardial injury, log-rank test p-value <0.001). CONCLUSIONS The presence of chronic kidney disease and application of invasive mechanical ventilation were found to be independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. The presence of acute myocardial injury was common but not independently associated with mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients.","Karahan, S; Katkat, F; Ozcan, S; Sahin, I; Okuyan, E",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,47,29

Following intranasal administration, the virus replicated in the lungs, with peak titers on day 2 postinfection. Enhanced production of cytokines (tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-alpha] and interleukin-6 [IL-6]) and chemokines (CXCL10, CCL2, CCL3, and CCL5) correlated with migration of NK cells, macrophages, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) into the lungs. By day 7, histopathologic evidence of pneumonitis was seen in the lungs when viral clearance occurred. At this time, a second wave of enhanced production of cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6, gamma interferon [IFN-gamma], IL-2, and IL-5), chemokines (CXCL9, CXCL10, CCL2, CCL3, and CCL5), and receptors (CXCR3, CCR2, and CCR5), was detected in the lungs, associated with an influx of T lymphocytes. Depletion of CD8(+) T cells at the time of infection did not affect viral replication or clearance. However, depletion of CD4(+) T cells resulted in an enhanced immune-mediated interstitial pneumonitis and delayed clearance of SARS-CoV from the lungs, which was associated with reduced neutralizing antibody and cytokine production and reduced pulmonary recruitment of lymphocytes. Innate defense mechanisms are able to control SARS-CoV infection in the absence of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and antibodies. Our findings provide new insights into the pathogenesis of SARS, demonstrating the important role of CD4(+) but not CD8(+) T cells in primary SARS-CoV infection in this model.","Chen, Jun; Lau, Yuk Fai; Lamirande, Elaine W; Paddock, Christopher D; Bartlett, Jeanine H; Zaki, Sherif R; Subbarao, Kanta",Journal of virology,47,1

METHODS one hundred nineteen intracranial aneurysms (38 ruptured, 81 unruptured) were analyzed from 3-dimensional angiographic images and computational fluid dynamics. Six morphological and 7 hemodynamic parameters were evaluated for significance with respect to rupture. Receiver operating characteristic analysis identified area under the curve (AUC) and optimal thresholds separating ruptured from unruptured aneurysms for each parameter. Significant parameters were examined by multivariate logistic regression analysis in 3 predictive models-morphology only, hemodynamics only, and combined-to identify independent discriminants, and the AUC receiver operating characteristic of the predicted probability of rupture status was compared among these models. RESULTS morphological parameters (size ratio, undulation index, ellipticity index, and nonsphericity index) and hemodynamic parameters (average wall shear stress [WSS], maximum intra-aneurysmal WSS, low WSS area, average oscillatory shear index, number of vortices, and relative resident time) achieved statistical significance (P<0.01). Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated size ratio to be the only independently significant factor in the morphology model (AUC, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.75 to 0.91), whereas WSS and oscillatory shear index were the only independently significant variables in the hemodynamics model (AUC, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.78 to 0.93). The combined model retained all 3 variables, size ratio, WSS, and oscillatory shear index (AUC, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.82 to 0.96). CONCLUSIONS all 3 models-morphological (based on size ratio), hemodynamic (based on WSS and oscillatory shear index), and combined-discriminate intracranial aneurysm rupture status with high AUC values. Hemodynamics is as important as morphology in discriminating aneurysm rupture status.","Xiang, Jianping; Natarajan, Sabareesh K; Tremmel, Markus; Ma, Ding; Mocco, J; Hopkins, L Nelson; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Levy, Elad I; Meng, Hui",Stroke,47,8

For poultry vaccines, these tests are often performed in laboratory chickens by vaccination-challenge trials or serological assays. The aim of this study was to investigate innate immune responses against inactivated poultry vaccines and identify candidate immune parameters for in vitro quality tests as alternatives for animal-based quality tests. For this purpose, we set up assays to measure nitric oxide production and phagocytosis by the macrophage-like cell line HD11, upon stimulation with inactivated poultry vaccines for infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), and egg drop syndrome virus (EDSV). In both assays, macrophages became activated after stimulation with various toll-like receptor agonists. Inactivated poultry vaccines stimulated HD11 cells to produce nitric oxide due to the presence of mineral oil adjuvant. Moreover, inactivated poultry vaccines were found to enhance Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis due to the presence of allantoic fluid in the vaccine antigen preparations. We showed that inactivated poultry vaccines stimulated nitric oxide production and Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis by chicken macrophages. Similar to antigen quantification methods, the cell-based assays described here can be used for future assessment of vaccine batch-to-batch consistency. The ability of the assays to determine the immunopotentiating properties of inactivated poultry vaccines provides an additional step in the replacement of current in vivo batch-release quality tests.","Biggelaar, Robin H G A van den; van Eden, Willem van; Rutten, Victor P M G; Jansen, Christine A",Vaccines,47,28

Oncological outcomes for partial nephrectomy are equivalent to radical nephrectomy, however, clamping of the hilar vessels to allow resection of tumours during partial nephrectomy may cause ischaemic damage to the kidney and result in long-term renal impairment. AIM We carried out a retrospective review of 43 patients undergoing laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN) and assessed functional and oncological outcomes. METHODS The operative technique initially utilised a thulium laser, with later cases using the LigaSure™ vessel sealing device. All patients underwent preoperative cross sectional imaging and anatomical classification accordingly. RESULTS Forty three patients underwent LPN in our unit from 2006 to 2014. The mean (range) tumour diameter on preoperative cross sectional imaging was 28.2 (12-49) mm. All cases had a warm ischaemia time of zero, as hilar vessels were not clamped in any case. The mean (range) preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 73 (37 to >90) ml/min/1.73 m2 and was not significantly different to the post-operative mean (range) eGFR of 71 (31 to >90) ml/min/1.73 m2. 34 (79%) of the tumours were found to be malignant. Positive surgical margins were found in one case. The mean (range) follow-up time in our cohort was 61.6 (24-127) months and no patient has had a local or distant recurrence. CONCLUSION Zero ischaemia laparoscopic partial nephrectomy appears to be a safe and oncologically satisfactory procedure for the management of small localised kidney tumours.","Browne, C; Lonergan, P E; Bolton, E M; D'Arcy, F; Lynch, T H",Irish journal of medical science,47,1

Recently, Futbol Club Barcelona's medical department proposed a new muscle injury classification in which muscle gap plays an important role, with the drawback that it is not always possible to identify by MRI. Localized bioimpedance measurement (L-BIA) has emerged as a non-invasive technique for supporting US and MRI to quantify the disrupted soft tissue structure in injured muscles. OBJECTIVE To correlate the severity of the injury according to the gap with the RTP, through the percent of change in resistance (R), reactance (Xc) and phase-angle (PA) by L-BIA measurements in 22 muscle injuries. MAIN RESULTS After grouping the data according to the muscle gap (by MRI exam), there were significant differences in R between grade 1 and grade 2f (myotendinous or myofascial muscle injury with feather-like appearance), as well as between grade 2f and grade 2g (myotendinous or myofascial muscle injury with feather and gap). The Xc and PA values decrease significantly between each grade (i.e. 1 versus 2f, 1 versus 2g and 2f versus 2g). In addition, the severity of the muscle gap adversely affected the RTP with significant differences observed between 1 and 2g as well as between 2f and 2g. SIGNIFICANCE These results show that L-BIA could aid MRI and US in identifying the severity of an injured muscle according to muscle gap and therefore to accurately predict the RTP.","Nescolarde, L; Yanguas, J; Terricabras, J; Lukaski, H; Alomar, X; Rosell-Ferrer, J; Rodas, G",Physiological measurement,47,30

However, two significant limitations remain-the need for 0.027"" microcatheters required for delivery of most flow diverting stents (FDS), and long-term dual anti-platelet therapy (DAPT) in order to prevent FDS-associated thromboembolism, at the cost of increasing the risk for hemorrhage. This study reports the experience of three neurovascular centers with the p64MW-HPC, a FDS with anti-thrombotic coating that is implantable via a 0.021"" microcatheter. Materials and methods: Three neurovascular centers contributed to this retrospective analysis of patients that had been treated with the p64MW-HPC between March 2020 and March 2021. Clinical data, aneurysm characteristics, and follow-up results, including procedural and post-procedural complications, were recorded. The hemodynamic effect was assessed using the O'Kelly-Marotta Scale (OKM). Results: Thirty-two patients (22 female, mean age 57.1 years) with 33 aneurysms (27 anterior circulation and six posterior circulation) were successfully treated with the p64MW-HPC. In 30/32 patients (93.75%), aneurysmal perfusion was significantly reduced immediately post implantation. Follow-up imaging was available for 23 aneurysms. Delayed aneurysm perfusion (OKM A3: 8.7%), reduction in aneurysm size (OKM B1-3: 26.1%), or sufficient separation from the parent vessel (OKM C1-3 and D1: 65.2%) was demonstrated at the last available follow-up after a mean of 5.9 months. In two cases, device thrombosis after early discontinuation of DAPT occurred. One delayed rupture caused a caroticocavernous fistula. The complications were treated sufficiently and all patients recovered without permanent significant morbidity. Conclusion: Treatment with the p64MW-HPC is safe and feasible and achieves good early aneurysm occlusion rates in the proximal intracranial circulation, which are comparable to those of well-established FDS. Sudden interruption of DAPT in the early post-interventional phase can cause in-stent thrombosis despite the HPC surface modification. Deliverability via the 0.021"" microcatheter facilitates treatment in challenging vascular anatomies.","Winters, Helge; Schüngel, Marie-Sophie; Scherlach, Cordula; Mucha, Dirk; Thalwitzer, Jörg; Härtig, Wolfgang; Donitza, Aneta; Bailis, Nikolaos; Maybaum, Jens; Hoffmann, Karl Titus; Quäschling, Ulf; Schob, Stefan",Frontiers in neurology,47,1

Pathobiological transitions and clinical stages of the COVID-19 syndrome following the attack of SARS-CoV-2 on the human body have not been fully explored. The aim of this review is to outline the three critical prominent phase regarding the clinicogenomics course of the COVID-19 immune syndrome. MATERIALS AND METHODS In the clinical setting, the COVID-19 process presents as ""asymptomatic/pre-symptomatic phase"", ""respiratory phase with mild/moderate/severe symptoms"" and ""multi-systemic clinical syndrome with impaired/disproportionate and/or defective immunity"". The corresponding three genomic phases include the ""ACE2, ANPEP transcripts in the initial phase"", ""EGFR and IGF2R transcripts in the propagating phase"" and the ""immune system related critical gene involvements of the complicating phase"". RESULTS The separation of the phases is important since the genomic features of each phase are different from each other and these different mechanisms lead to distinct clinical multi-systemic features. Comprehensive genomic profiling with next generation sequencing may play an important role in defining and clarifying these three unique separate phases for COVID-19. From our point of view, it is important to understand these unique phases of the syndrome in order to approach a COVID-19 patient bedside. CONCLUSIONS This three-phase approach may be useful for future studies which will focus on the clinical management and development of the vaccines and/or specific drugs targeting the COVID-19 processes. ANPEP gene pathway may have a potential for the vaccine development. Regarding the specific disease treatments, MAS agonists, TXA127, Angiotensin (1-7) and soluble ACE2 could have therapeutic potential for the COVID-19 course. Moreover, future CRISPR technology can be utilized for the genomic editing and future management of the clinical course of the syndrome.","Turk, C; Turk, S; Malkan, U Y; Haznedaroglu, I C",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,47,1

We sought to examine whether the incidence of cerebral oxygen desaturation in elderly patients (≥68 years of age) undergoing spine surgery in the prone position was more common than patients undergoing major surgery in the supine position. METHODS We performed a retrospective cohort study of 205 patients; 63 patients underwent surgery in the prone position and 142 in the supine position. Patients were evaluated for cerebral desaturation with bilateral cerebral oximetry. The primary predictor was position, secondary were: length of the surgery, incidence and duration of cerebral desaturation episodes at several thresholds, average time of Bispectral index below threshold of 45 in minutes, average electroencephalogram suppression ratio >0, amount of blood transfused, and the incidence of hypotension and hypertension. RESULTS Elderly spine surgery patients in the prone position were more than twice as likely to experience mild cerebral desaturation as patients in the supine position. Patients in the prone position had longer surgeries; however cerebral desaturation in the prone position was significantly more common even when adjusted for surgery time and the occurrence of intraoperative hypotension. CONCLUSION Cerebral desaturation is related to the prone position in elderly surgery patients. Future studies are necessary to determine whether this translates to a higher incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction and delirium.","Deiner, Stacie; Chu, Isaac; Mahanian, Michelle; Lin, Hung-Mo; Hecht, Andrew C; Silverstein, Jeffrey H",PloS one,47,16

Pre-Tdap era data suggest that maternal pertussis antibodies in infants have a half-life of approximately 5-6 weeks. METHODS 34 mother-infant pairs had blood collected before maternal Tdap vaccination, 4 weeks later, at delivery (maternal and cord), and at infant ages 3 and 6 weeks from June 2014-March 2015. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) to pertussis toxin (PT), filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA), fimbrial proteins (FIM) and pertactin (PRN) was quantified by multiplex luminex assay (IU/ml). Geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) with 95% confidence intervals (C.I.) and half-life of pertussis antibodies were calculated. RESULTS Tdap was administered to 34 women (mean age 31.1 years) at mean gestation 30.7 weeks (28-32.7). Mean neonatal gestation was 39.1 weeks (36-41.1) and mean birthweight was 3379 g (2580-4584). Four weeks post-Tdap vaccination, maternal pertussis-specific IgG GMCs increased ≥4-fold in 59%, 41%, 29% and 44% of women for PT, FHA, FIM and PRN, respectively, and then waned. The transplacental transport ratio of pertussis antibodies was 1.35 for PT, 1.41 for FHA, 1.31 for FIM and 1.36 for PRN. Between birth and age 6 weeks, infant serum GMC for PT-specific IgG decreased from 55.1 IU/mL (38.6-78.6) to 21.1 IU/ml (14.7-30.2), and the proportion of infants with PT levels ≥10 IU/ml fell from 97% to 67%.

A fast and label free detection method for the novel coronavirus needs to be developed along with the existing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) based methods. AREAS COVERED In this report, biophysical aspects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike glycoprotein are outlined based on its recent reported electron microscopy structure. Protein binding sites are analyzed theoretically, which consisted of hydrophobic and positive charged amino acid residues. Different strategies to form mixed self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of hydrophobic (CH3) and negatively charged (COOH) groups are discussed to be used for the specific and strong interactions with spike protein. Bio-interfacial interactions between the spike protein and device (sensor) surface and its implications towards designing suitable engineered surfaces are summarized. EXPERT OPINION Implementation of the engineered surfaces in quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) based detection techniques for the diagnosis of the novel coronavirus from oral swab samples is highlighted. The proposed strategy can be explored for the label free and real time detection with sensitivity up to ng level. These engineered surfaces can be reused after desorption.","Pandey, Lalit M",Expert review of proteomics,47,25

We aimed to understand family caregivers' perspectives on home care workers. METHODS This qualitative study took place at an academic medical center in New York, N.Y. We interviewed family caregivers of community-dwelling older adults about their experiences with home care workers. We analyzed transcripts thematically. RESULTS We interviewed 17 family caregivers and identified four major themes: (a) home care workers provide functional and emotional support; (b) home care is logistically challenging; (c) finding the right fit between home care workers, older adults, and families is essential; and (d) home care workers and family caregivers coordinate care well beyond the initiation of home care. CONCLUSION Despite its logistical challenges, home care benefits patients and family caregivers. Given the growing prevalence of caregiving, clinicians and family caregivers might benefit from training and support about working with home care workers.","Shaw, Amy L; Riffin, Catherine A; Shalev, Ariel; Kaur, Harveen; Sterling, Madeline R",Journal of applied gerontology : the official journal of the Southern Gerontological Society,47,19

Thermo transient receptor potential (thermoTRP) channels are some of the most intensely pursued therapeutic targets of the past decade. They are considered promising targets of numerous diseases including chronic pain and cancer. Modulators of these proteins, in particular TRPV1-4, TRPM8 and TRPA1, have reached clinical development, but none have been approved for clinical practice yet. AREAS COVERED . The therapeutic potential of targeting thermoTRP channels is discussed. The discussion is centered on our experience and on available data found in SciFinder, PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov database from the past decade. This review focuses on the therapeutic progress concerning this family of channels, including strategies to improve their therapeutic index for overcoming adverse effects. EXPERT OPINION . Although thermoTRPs are pivotal drug targets, translation to the clinic has faced two key problems, (i) unforeseen side effects in Phase I trials and, (ii) poor clinical efficacy in Phase II trials. Thus, there is a need for (i) an enhanced understanding of the physiological role of these channels in tissues and organs and (ii) the development of human-based pre-clinical models with higher clinical translation. Furthermore, progress in nanotechnology-based delivery strategies will positively impact thermoTRP human pharmacology.","Fernández-Carvajal, Asia; González-Muñiz, Rosario; Fernández-Ballester, Gregorio; Ferrer-Montiel, Antonio",Expert opinion on investigational drugs,47,31

SNOMED CT is the terminology of choice in the NHS for communicating, sharing and storing information about patients' healthcare episodes. Harmonisation of GMDN and SNOMED CT will encourage use of single terminology throughout the lifetime of a device; from regulatory approval through clinical use and post-marketing surveillance. Manufacturers will be required to register medical devices with a European device database (Eudamed) and to fit certain devices with a Unique Device Identifier; both are efforts to improve transparency and traceability of medical devices.

The aim was to characterise headache and investigate the association with intracranial pressure. METHODS IIH:WT was a randomised controlled parallel group multicentre trial in the United Kingdom investigating weight management methods in IIH. Participants with active IIH (evidenced by papilloedema) and a body mass index (BMI) ≥35 kg/m2 were recruited. At baseline, 12 months and 24 months headache characteristics and quality of life outcome measures were collected and lumbar puncture measurements were performed. RESULTS Sixty-six women with active IIH were included with a mean age of 32.0 years (SD ± 7.8), and mean body mass index of 43.9 ± 7.0 kg/m2. The headache phenotype was migraine-like in 90%. Headache severity correlated with ICP at baseline (r = 0.285; p = 0.024); change in headache severity and monthly headache days correlated with change in ICP at 12 months (r = 0.454, p = 0.001 and r = 0.419, p = 0.002 respectively). Cutaneous allodynia was significantly correlated with ICP at 12 months. (r = 0.479, p < 0.001). Boot strap analysis noted a positive association between ICP at 12 and 24 months and enabled prediction of both change in headache severity and monthly headache days. ICP was associated with significant improvements in quality of life (SF-36). CONCLUSIONS We demonstrate a positive relationship between ICP and headache and cutaneous allodynia, which has not been previously reported in IIH. Those with the greatest reduction in ICP over 12 months had the greatest reduction in headache frequency and severity; this was associated with improvement of quality of life measures.

However, accurate and consistent measurement is challenged by contextual differences between and within countries on the definition of SBA, including the education, training, competencies, and functions they are qualified to perform. This scoping review identifies and maps the health personnel considered SBA in low-to-middle-income-countries (LMIC). METHODS AND ANALYSIS A search was conducted inclusive to the years 2000 to 2015 in PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL Complete, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, POPLINE and the World Health Organization Global Index Medicus. Original primary source research conducted in LMIC that evaluated the skilled health personnel providing interventions during labour and childbirth were considered for inclusion. All studies reported disaggregated data of SBA cadres and were disaggregated by country. RESULTS The search of electronic databases identified a total of 23,743 articles. Overall, 70 articles were included in the narrative synthesis. A total of 102 unique cadres names were identified from 36 LMIC countries. Of the cadres included, 16% represented doctors, 16% were nurses, and 15% were midwives. We found substantial heterogeneity between and within countries on the reported definition of SBA and the education, training, skills and competencies that they were able to perform. CONCLUSION The uncertainty and diversity of reported qualifications and competency of SBA within and between countries requires attention in order to better ascertain strategic priorities for future health system planning, including training and education. These results can inform recommendations around improved coverage measurement and monitoring of SBA moving forward, allowing for more accurate, consistent, and timely data able to guide decisions and action around planning and implementation of maternal and newborn health programmes.","Hobbs, Amy J; Moller, Ann-Beth; Kachikis, Alisa; Carvajal-Aguirre, Liliana; Say, Lale; Chou, Doris",PloS one,47,1

Although recent studies have revealed the ability of these stem cells in multipotential attribute, their efficiency of hepatic lineage differentiation has not been addressed so far. The aim of this study is to investigate hepatic lineage fate competence of periodontal ligament stem cells through direct media induction. Differentiation of periodontal ligament stem cells into hepatocyte-like cells was conducted by the exposure of two phase media induction. First phase was performed in the presence of hepatocyte growth factors to induce a definitive endoderm formation. In the subsequent phase, the cells were treated with oncostatin M and dexamethosone followed by insulin and transferrin to generate hepatocyte-like cells. Hepatic-related characters of the generated hepatocyte-like cells were determined at both mRNA and protein level followed by functional assays. Foremost changes observed in the generation of hepatocyte-like cells were the morphological features in which these cells were transformed from fibroblastic shape to polygonal shape. Temporal expression of hepatic markers ranging from early endodermal up to late markers were detected in the hepatocyte-like cells. Crucial hepatic markers such as glycogen storage, albumin, and urea secretion were also shown. These findings exhibited the ability of periodontal ligament stem cells of dental origin to be directed into hepatic lineage fate. These cells can be regarded as an alternative autologous source in the usage of stem cell-based treatment for liver diseases.","Vasanthan, Punitha; Jayaraman, Pukana; Kunasekaran, Wijenthiran; Lawrence, Anthony; Gnanasegaran, Nareshwaran; Govindasamy, Vijayendran; Musa, Sabri; Kasim, Noor Hayaty Abu",Die Naturwissenschaften,47,16

Open partial nephrectomy is the standard operative technique. The use of minimally-invasive strategies such as laparoscopic, robot-assisted partial nephrectomy or laparoendoscopic single site (LESS) partial nephrectomy has increased in recent years. PATIENTS/MATERIAL AND METHODS In this retrospective study, patients undergoing laparoscopic partial nephrectomy between December 2008 and November 2013 were evaluated. All patients presented with renal lesions suspicious for malignancy. Operations were performed as conventional laparoscopic transperitoneal partial nephrectomies (cLPN) or LESS partial nephrectomies (LESS-PN) in SITUS technique (single incision transumbilical surgery). The aim of the study was to compare perioperative outcome parameters such as duration of surgery, time of ischaemia, complications, need for transfusion, conversion rates, changes in renal function and duration of hospital stay in both groups. RESULTS A total of 85 laparoscopic partial nephrectomies were performed in this study (72 cLPN and 13 LESS-PN). The average tumour size was 2.68±1.47 cm (cLPN) vs. 2.46±1.11 cm (LESS-PN). The mean duration of surgery was 175.17±50.026 min (cLPN) and 185.77±35.991 min (LESS-PN). 45 (62.5%) operations (cLPN) vs. 10 (76.9%) (LESS-PN) were performed in zero-ischaemia technique. There were no significant differences in perioperative outcome parameters between both groups. Postoperative complication rates (Clavien-Dindo≥3) were 11.1% (cLPN) vs. 7.7% (LESS-PN).

First is the specificity of the measurement of CO2 within the device, and second is the dilution effect of supplemental gases in the ambient air during CO2 sampling by the device. Our goal was to determine if variables such as inhaled gas composition, gas flows delivered via non-rebreather mask, and mouth open or closed affect measurements of end-tidal CO2 pressure (PETCO2) measured with the Capnostream 20 capnograph. METHODS We measured PETCO2 and breathing frequency by capnography in 20 adult normal subjects, with coaching to maintain respiratory frequency between 10 and 20 breaths/min. SpO2 was monitored to detect hypoxemia. A 6 min wash-out period occurred between each 6 min level of testing. RESULTS A mixed models analysis revealed that the mean ± SD PETCO2 for all subjects and flows while breathing heliox (37 ± 5 mm Hg) was not different (P = .50) from the value while breathing room air (36 ± 5 mm Hg). Repeated measurements with given subjects over 6 min periods of breathing spontaneously 0 L/min, with 10 L/min, and with 15 L/min of either air or heliox showed no difference in PETCO2 related to flow: P = .97 for 0 L/min vs 10 L/min, P = .87 for 0 L/min vs. 15 L/min. CONCLUSIONS In normal subjects, PETCO2 measurements with the Capnostream 20 were not affected by heliox or gas flow at 10 or 15 L/min through a non-rebreathing mask.","Waugh, Jonathan B; Gardner, Donna D; Vines, David L",Respiratory care,47,17

The aim of this study was to evaluate short- and long-term outcomes after LPG-DFT and LSTG. METHODS Patients who underwent LPG-DFT or LSTG at the Cancer Institute Hospital in Tokyo between January 2006 and April 2015 were included in this retrospective study. Operative procedures were selected based on the distance from the cardia to the proximal boundary of the tumour, tumour location and predicted remnant stomach volume. Patient characteristics, surgical data, markers of postoperative nutritional status, such as blood chemistry and bodyweight loss, and endoscopic findings were compared between procedures. The main study outcome was nutritional status. RESULTS A total of 161 patients (LPG-DFT 51, LSTG 110) were included. Types of postoperative complication occurring more than 30 days after surgery differed between the two procedures. Remnant stomach ulcers, including anastomotic ulcers, were observed only after LPG-DFT, whereas complications involving the small intestine, such as internal hernia or small bowel obstruction, occurred more frequently after LSTG. Values for total protein, albumin, prealbumin and bodyweight loss were comparable between the two procedures at 36 months after surgery. Haemoglobin concentrations were higher after LPG-DFT than after LSTG at 24 months (13·4 versus 12·8 g/dl respectively; P = 0·045) and 36 months (13·5 versus 12·8 g/dl; P = 0·007) after surgery.

OBJECTIVE To demonstrate the feasibility of the endonasal endoscopic approach in a variety of age groups and to perform measurements of the corridors and spaces available for surgery as a guide for case selection. METHODS Only patients <18 years were included. The choice of operative corridor/approach is described in relation to pathological entity and location. Preoperative/postoperative visual fields and endocrine panels, extent of resection, as well as postoperative long-term complications are described. Prospective magnetic resonance image-based anatomic measurements of key distances were performed to determine age-dependent surgical indications and limitations. RESULTS Forty purely endoscopic procedures were performed in 33 pediatric patients (5-18 years of age) harboring a variety of skull base lesions, from benign tumors to congenital malformations. For the 20 patients in whom gross total resection was the intended goal of surgery, gross total resection was attained in 15 (75%). There were 2 infections (5%) and no cerebrospinal fluid leaks. Significant improvement was shown in 58.3% of patients with visual deficits. Hormone overproduction resolved in 75% of patients, while preoperative hormone insufficiency only improved in 29.2%. Wider intercarotid distance at the superior clivus (P = .01) and shorter nare-dens working distance (P = .001) predicted improved outcomes and fewer postoperative complications. CONCLUSION Endonasal endoscopic skull base approaches are viable in the pediatric population, they are not impeded by sphenoid sinus aeration, and they have minimal risk of cerebrospinal fluid leak and meningitis. Outcomes and complications can be predicted based on specific radio anatomical skull base measurements rather than age.","Banu, Matei A; Rathman, Allison; Patel, Kunal S; Souweidane, Mark M; Anand, Vijay K; Greenfield, Jeffrey P; Schwartz, Theodore H",Neurosurgery,47,8

Even when interventions produce the desired outcomes in attitudes, it is often challenging to translate those psychological changes into subsequent behaviors. Previous research has shown that elaboration (amount of thinking) is a critical construct for understanding the ability of attitudes to guide behavior. Instead of looking directly at objective elaboration, this study examined attitude-behavior correspondence as a function of subjective elaboration. METHOD Participants were first randomly assigned to generate positive or negative arguments with regard to taxing junk food. After this experimental manipulation, participants reported their subjective elaboration (as an additional predictor), and their attitudes and behavioral intentions regarding the proposal (as dependent measures). RESULTS As hypothesized, the results showed that the greater perceived elaboration, the larger the ability of attitudes to guide behavioral intentions. That is, attitudes were more predictive of behavioral intentions in participants with higher levels of perceived elaboration compared to those with relatively lower levels of subjective thinking.

To date, mechanical sensors and surface electromyography (EMG) have been the primary sensing modalities used to classify ambulation. Ultrasound (US) imaging can be used to detect user-intent by characterizing structural changes of muscle. Our study evaluates wearable US imaging as a new sensing modality for continuous classification of five discrete modes: level, incline, decline, stair ascent, and stair descent ambulation, and benchmarks performance relative to EMG sensing. Ten subjects were equipped with a wearable US scanner and eight unilateral EMG sensors. Time-intensity features were recorded from US images of three thigh muscles. Features from sliding windows of EMG signals were analyzed in two configurations: one including 5 EMG sensors on muscles around the thigh, and another with 3 additional sensors placed on the shank. Linear discriminate analysis was implemented to continuously classify these phase-dependent features of each sensing modality as one of five modes. Five-fold cross-validation was used for each modality and subject. US-based sensing statistically improved mean classification accuracy to 99.8% (99.5×100% CI) compared to 8-EMG sensors (85.8%; 84.0×87.6% CI) and 5-EMG sensors (75.3%; 74.5×76.1% CI). Further, separability analyses show the importance of superficial and deep US information for stair classification relative to other modes. These results are the first to demonstrate the ability of US-based sensing to classify discrete ambulation modes, highlighting the potential for improved assistive device control using less widespread, less superficial and higher resolution sensing of skeletal muscle.","Rabe, Kaitlin G; Jahanandish, M Hassan; Boehm, Jacob R; Majewicz Fey, Ann; Hoyt, Kenneth; Fey, Nicholas P",IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,47,33

Stromal cells have been tested as therapy for HC. Decidua stromal cells (DSCs) protect the fetus from the mother's immune system. METHODS Eleven patients with HC of grades 3-4 were treated with DSCs after HSCT. The median age was 33 years (range 8-50), and the median dose of DSCs was 1.5 × 106/kg (range 0.7-2.5). The patients were given 1 dose (1-4). RESULTS In 5 patients, HC disappeared within 5 days after DSC infusion. Patients who received DSCs within 3 days after the start of HC had a duration of HC of 5 days and a shorter duration of pain than patients who were given DSCs later (p = 0.02). Three patients received DSCs prepared in albumin instead of AB-plasma and tended to have a shorter duration of pain (p = 0.07). There was no infusion toxicity. Adverse events were those often seen after HSCT. Nine of the 11 patients (82%) were alive 1 year after HSCT. CONCLUSIONS Based on this pilot study, we started a randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind study using 2 doses of 1 × 106 DSCs/kg suspended in albumin for treatment of early HC.","Aronsson-Kurttila, Wictor; Baygan, Arjang; Moretti, Gianluca; Remberger, Mats; Khoein, Bita; Moll, Guido; Sadeghi, Behnam; Ringdén, Olle",Acta haematologica,47,16

By thematically classifying the most common concussive clinical presentations into concussion subtypes (cognitive, ocular-motor, headache/migraine, vestibular, and anxiety/mood) and associated conditions (cervical strain and sleep disturbance), we derive useful definitions amenable to future targeted treatments. OBJECTIVE To use evidence-based methodology to characterize the 5 concussion subtypes and 2 associated conditions and report their prevalence in acute concussion patients as compared to baseline or controls within 3 d of injury. METHODS A multidisciplinary expert workgroup was established to define the most common concussion subtypes and their associated conditions and select clinical questions related to prevalence and recovery. A literature search was conducted from January 1, 1990 to November 1, 2017. Two experts abstracted study characteristics and results independently for each article selected for inclusion. A third expert adjudicated disagreements. Separate meta-analyses were conducted to do the following: 1) examine the prevalence of each subtype/associated condition in concussion patients using a proportion, 2) assess subtype/associated conditions in concussion compared to baseline/uninjured controls using a prevalence ratio, and 3) compare the differences in symptom scores between concussion subtypes and uninjured/baseline controls using a standardized mean difference (SMD). RESULTS The most prevalent concussion subtypes for pediatric and adult populations were headache/migraine (0.52; 95% CI = 0.37, 0.67) and cognitive (0.40; 95% CI = 0.25, 0.55), respectively. In pediatric patients, the prevalence of the vestibular subtype was also high (0.50; 95% CI = 0.40, 0.60). Adult patients were 4.4, 2.9, and 1.7 times more likely to demonstrate cognitive, vestibular, and anxiety/mood subtypes, respectively, as compared with their controls (P < .05). Children and adults with concussion showed significantly more cognitive symptoms than their respective controls (SMD = 0.66 and 0.24; P < .001). Furthermore, ocular-motor in adult patients (SMD = 0.72; P < .001) and vestibular symptoms in both pediatric and adult patients (SMD = 0.18 and 0.36; P < .05) were significantly worse in concussion patients than in controls. CONCLUSION Five concussion subtypes with varying prevalence within 3 d following injury are commonly seen clinically and identifiable upon systematic literature review. Sleep disturbance, a concussion-associated condition, is also common. There was insufficient information available for analysis of cervical strain. A comprehensive acute concussion assessment defines and characterizes the injury and, therefore, should incorporate evaluations of all 5 subtypes and associated conditions.","Lumba-Brown, Angela; Teramoto, Masaru; Bloom, O Josh; Brody, David; Chesnutt, James; Clugston, James R; Collins, Michael; Gioia, Gerard; Kontos, Anthony; Lal, Avtar; Sills, Allen; Ghajar, Jamshid",Neurosurgery,47,5

Sporozoites are motile and move in the skin to find and enter blood vessels to be carried to the liver. Here, we present the first characterization of P. falciparum sporozoites in vivo, analyzing their motility in mouse skin and human skin xenografts and comparing their motility to two rodent malaria species. These data suggest that in contrast to the liver and blood stages, the skin is not a species-specific barrier for Plasmodium. Indeed, P. falciparum sporozoites enter blood vessels in mouse skin at similar rates to the rodent malaria parasites. Furthermore, we demonstrate that antibodies targeting sporozoites significantly impact the motility of P. falciparum sporozoites in mouse skin. Though the sporozoite stage is a validated vaccine target, vaccine trials have been hampered by the lack of good animal models for human malaria parasites. Pre-clinical screening of next-generation vaccines would be significantly aided by the in vivo platform we describe here, expediting down-selection of candidates prior to human vaccine trials.","Hopp, Christine S; Kanatani, Sachie; Archer, Nathan K; Miller, Robert J; Liu, Haiyun; Chiou, Kevin K; Miller, Lloyd S; Sinnis, Photini",EMBO molecular medicine,47,30

A computed tomography of the brain with CT-angiography should be the minimal standard imaging modality in acute ischemic stroke patients. Diffusion-weighted/imaging-fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)-mismatch magnetic resonance imaging can be useful in patients with wake-up stroke to select patients for recanalisation therapies. Systemic thrombolysis with rt-PA within 4.5 hours after symptom onset and mechanical thrombectomy with stent retrievers within 6 hours and proven occlusion of a large vessel in the anterior brain circulation are both evidence-based treatments. In contrast, there are no major therapeutic advances in patients with hemorrhagic stroke. The systolic blood pressure should be lowered < 140 mm Hg in these patients within one hour. Both acute ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke and patients with a transient ischemic attack should be monitored and treated on a stroke unit due to an improved outcome.

To address this issue, we report a microemulsion system based on tripterine, brucea oil, and glycyrrhizin, and dual modified with both transferrin and cell-penetrating peptide SA-R6H4 (Tf/SA-R6H4-TBG-MEs) for combinational and tumor-targeted cancer therapy. Such a microemulsion exhibited a spherical shape with a size of ~50 nm and a mildly-negative charge. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of Tf/SA-R6H4-TBG-MEs against ovarian cancer SKOV3 cells was 0.27 ± 0.43 μg tripterine/mL, which was 5.85 times lower than that of free tripterine. The cellular uptake of tripterine after treatment with Tf/SA-R6H4-TBG-MEs was 1.56 times higher than that of TBG-MEs (non-modified microemulsion). In pharmacokinetics studies, the area under the curve of Tf/SA-R6H4-TBG-MEs increased by 1.97 times compared with that of the physical mixture group. The tumoral accumulation of tripterine was significantly improved in Tf/SA-R6H4-TBG-MEs group than TBG-MEs-treated group. In antitumor efficacy in vivo, Tf/SA-R6H4-TBG-MEs exhibited the strongest inhibition of tumor growth and the longest survival period among all the groups, which is associated with the rational combination, microemulsion system, and dual modification with tumor-targeted ligands. Importantly, Tf/SA-R6H4-TBG-MEs significantly reduced the toxicity of tripterine against the liver and kidney. Our design provides a new approach for efficient and safe ovarian cancer therapy based on a multicomponent combination.","Zhao, Haijun; Chen, Mengyuan; Zhao, Zhujiang; Zhu, Linjia; Yuan, Shaofei",Drug delivery and translational research,47,1

Literature supports the single- and multi-staged approaches including the use of biological meshes for these difficult patients with their associated benefits and limitations. PATIENTS AND METHODS This is a retrospective analysis of a prospective study of five patients who were successfully treated through a multi-staged approach but in the same hospital admission, not previously described, for the repair of contaminated primary and recurrent giant incisional herniae in a district general hospital between 2009 and 2012. Patient demographics including their BMI and ASA, previous and current operative history including complications and follow-up were collected in a secure database. The first stage involved the eradication of contamination, and the second stage was the definitive hernia repair with the new generation-coated synthetic meshes. RESULTS Of the five patients, three were men and two women with a mean age of 58 (45-74) years. Two patients had grade 4 while the remaining had grade 3 hernia as per the hernia grading system with a mean BMI of 35 (30-46). All patients required extensive adhesiolysis, bowel resection and anastomoses and wash out. Hernial defect was measured as 204* (105-440) cm(2), size of mesh implant was 568* (375-930) cm(2) and the total duration of operation (1st + 2nd Stage) was 354* (270-540) min. Duration of hospital stay was 11* (7-19) days with a follow-up of 17* (6-36) months. CONCLUSION We believe that our multi-staged approach in the same hospital admission (for the repair of contaminated primary and recurrent giant incisional herniae), excludes the disadvantages of a true multi-staged approach and simultaneously minimises the risks and complications associated with a single-staged repair, can be adopted for these challenging patients for a successful outcome (* indicates mean).","Siddique, K; Shrestha, A; Basu, S",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,47,19

In this study, subcellular proteomic profiles of human A549 cells inoculated with H3N2 subtype SIV were used to characterize dynamic cellular responses to infection. By 2DE and MS, 27 differentially expressed (13 upregulated, 14 downregulated) cytoplasmic proteins and 20 differentially expressed (13 upregulated, 7 downregulated) nuclear proteins were identified. Gene ontology analysis suggested that these differentially expressed proteins were mainly involved in cell death, stress response, lipid metabolism, cell signaling, and RNA PTMs. Moreover, 25 corresponding genes of the differentially expressed proteins were quantitated by real time RT-PCR to examine the transcriptional profiles between mock- and virus-infected A549 cells. Western blot analysis confirmed that changes in abundance of identified cellular proteins heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) U, hnRNP C, ALDH1A1, tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase, IFI35, and HSPB1 in H3N2 SIV-infected cells were consistent with results of 2DE analysis. By confocal microscopy, nucleus-to-cytoplasm translocation of hnRNP C and colocalization between the viral nonstructural protein 1 and hnRNP C as well as N-myc (and STAT) interactor were observed upon infection. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed that cellular proteins altered during infection were grouped mainly into NFκB and interferon signaling networks. Collectively, these identified subcellular constituents provide an important framework for understanding host/SIV interactions and underlying mechanisms of SIV cross-species infection and pathogenesis.","Wu, Xiaopeng; Wang, Sanying; Yu, Yang; Zhang, Jinyang; Sun, Zeyu; Yan, Yan; Zhou, Jiyong",Proteomics,47,1

In addition, the complexities of sample acquisition, processing, and analysis, even in developed regions, can be rate limiting. Therefore, new strategies to survey human populations for emerging pathogens are necessary. Xenosurveillance is a method that utilizes mosquitoes as sampling devices to search for genetic signatures of pathogens in vertebrates. Previously we demonstrated that xenosurveillance can detect viral RNA in both laboratory and field settings. However, its ability to detect bacteria and parasites remains to be assessed. Accordingly, we fed Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes blood that contained Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and Bacillus anthracis. In addition, we determined whether two additional emerging viruses, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus and Zika virus could be detected by this method. Pathogen-specific real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to evaluate the sensitivity of xenosurveillance across multiple pathogen taxa and over time. We detected RNA from all pathogens at clinically relevant concentrations from mosquitoes processed up to 1 day postbloodfeeding. These results demonstrate that xenosurveillance may be used as a tool to expand surveillance for viral, parasitic, and bacterial pathogens in resource-limited areas.","Fauver, Joseph R; Gendernalik, Alex; Weger-Lucarelli, James; Grubaugh, Nathan D; Brackney, Doug E; Foy, Brian D; Ebel, Gregory D",The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,47,12

International recommendations for the control of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic emphasize the central role of laboratory testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent, at scale. The availability of testing reagents, laboratory equipment and qualified staff are important bottlenecks to achieving this. Elsewhere, pooled testing (i.e. combining multiple samples in the same reaction) has been suggested to increase testing capacities in the pandemic period. Methods. We discuss our experience with SARS-CoV-2 pooled testing using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on the Kenyan Coast. Results. In mid-May, 2020, our RT-PCR testing capacity for SARS-CoV-2 was improved by ~100% as a result of adoption of a six-sample pooled testing strategy. This was accompanied with a concomitant saving of ~50% of SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test kits at both the RNA extraction and RT-PCR stages. However, pooled testing came with a slight decline of test sensitivity. The RT-PCR cycle threshold value (ΔCt) was ~1.59 higher for samples tested in pools compared to samples tested singly.

METHODS Twelve healthy men participated in two experimental conditions (randomized crossover design): extended sleep (EXT, 9.8 ± 0.1 h time in bed) and habitual sleep (HAB, 8.2 ± 0.1 h time in bed). In each condition, subjects performed six nights of either EXT or HAB at home followed by an assessment of motor performance and neuromuscular function at baseline (D0) and after one night of TSD, i.e., 34-37 h of continuous wakefulness (D1). Maximal voluntary contractions with superimposed femoral nerve electrical and transcranial magnetic stimulations and stimulations on relaxed muscles were investigated before and after submaximal isometric knee extensor exercises performed until task failure. RESULTS Time to exhaustion was longer in EXT compared with HAB (+3.9% ± 7.7% and +8.1% ± 12.3% at D0 and D1, respectively). Performance at D1 decreased from D0 similarly between conditions (-7.2% ± 5.6% and -3.7% ± 7.3% in HAB and EXT, respectively). At D1, the RPE during exercise was lower in EXT compared with HAB (-7.2% ± 7.5%) with no difference at D0. No difference was observed in voluntary activation between the two conditions. CONCLUSIONS Six nights of sleep extension improved sustained contraction time to exhaustion, and this result cannot be explained by smaller reductions in voluntary activation, measured by both nerve and transcranial magnetic stimulation. The beneficial effect on motor performance in the EXT condition was likely due to reduced RPE after TSD.","Arnal, Pierrick J; Lapole, Thomas; Erblang, Mégane; Guillard, Mathias; Bourrilhon, Cyprien; Léger, Damien; Chennaoui, Mounir; Millet, Guillaume Y",Medicine and science in sports and exercise,47,1

METHODS A prospective cohort study during 4 winter seasons (2012-2016) was conducted in a Dutch general pediatric ward including otherwise healthy children <2 years of age hospitalized for bronchiolitis. Patients shared a 1-to-4-bed hospital room irrespective of virological diagnosis. The main outcome measures were HAIs assessed through multiplex polymerase chain reaction and disease severity. RESULTS HAIs occurred in 28 of 218 included patients (12.8%), most frequently with rhinovirus (17 of 28; 60.7%). In 3 (10.7%) of 28 HAIs, the same virus was identified in roommates. Only 1 patient became cross-infected with respiratory syncytial virus, although this patient never shared a room with a patient infected with respiratory syncytial virus. HAI was not associated with more severe disease. The median length of hospitalization was 3.5 days (interquartile range [IQR] 1-6) compared with 3 days (IQR 2-6; P = .86); the number of PICU admissions was 0% versus 5.3% (P = .21); the median days of oxygen supplementation was 2.5 (IQR 1-4) versus 2 (IQR 1-4; P = .58); the median days of tube feeding was 2 (IQR 0-5) versus 2 (interquartile range: 0-5; P = .77); and the readmission rate was 0% versus 5.8% (P = .19) in patients with and without HAI, respectively. CONCLUSIONS HAIs among patients with bronchiolitis are common but not associated with more severe disease. Room sharing with appropriate hygiene does not play a relevant role in the transmission of viruses between patients with bronchiolitis, regardless of the viruses involved. On the basis of these findings, we suggest that room sharing of patients with bronchiolitis is safe.","Bekhof, Jolita; Wessels, Mirjam; Ten Velde, Eline; Hoekstra, Minke; Langenhorst, Veerle; Bruijnesteijn, Lesla; Brand, Paul L P; Ruijs, Gijs J H M",Hospital pediatrics,47,1

METHODS Fifteen anesthetized pigs were randomized to receive either nonselective endothelin-1 (ET-1) blocker tezosentan (TG, n = 7) or saline (CG, n = 8). Helium was insufflated to increase IAP from 0 to 25 mmHg. Stroke volume variability was maintained ≤ 12% with colloid infusion. Total liver blood flow (TLBF), hepatic microcirculatory blood flow (MBF), hepatic tissue oxygenation (HpO(2)), hyaluronic acid and plasma disappearance rate (PDR) of indocyanine green (ICG) were recorded. RESULTS TLBF remained mostly unaltered in both groups at low IAP and decreased only in CG at the IAP of 25 mmHg. As IAP increased, a significant decline in MBF was observed without correlation with cardiac output or TLBF. In CG, HpO(2) decreased as early as IAP of 10 mmHg to high levels of pressure. However, in TG the decrease was significant only at the IAP of 25 mmHg. PDR of ICG decreased in both groups at IAP of 25 mmHg (P = 0.046 and P = 0.009 in TG and CG, respectively).

STUDY DESIGN Longitudinal 7-month retrospective review of sequential tonsil and adenoid surgery at a university pediatric tertiary care hospital. METHODS All children aged 2 to 12 years who underwent adenotonsillectomy from May 2008 to October 2008 had charts and billing records analyzed for variations in charges and times of adenotonsillectomy according to patient age, body mass index for age (BMIFA), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) status, surgical indication, technology used, and teaching status of case. A total of 214 children had records reviewed. RESULTS Statistically significant variations were observed for all measured parameters except for indications for surgery. Children 3 years and younger had shorter procedures (P = .005) and total operating room times (P = .037). Charges for supplies were lower for ASA 1 patients than for ASA 2 patients (P = .010). Obese children with elevated BMIFA required longer procedures (P = .039) and more expensive surgery (P = .003). Procedure times were shorter for Coblation (ArthroCare, Austin, TX) compared with electrocautery (P = .27) and for microdebrider compared with electrocautery (P < .001). Charges for Coblation were substantially higher (P < .001). Teaching cases took longer (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS Charges and times for adenotonsillectomy surgery varied by patient age, BMIFA, ASA status, tonsillectomy technique, and teaching case status. Clinically salient differences were noted for ASA status, BMIFA, and surgical technique. This method of cost analysis provides useful information for resource management in tonsillectomy.","Shah, Udayan K; Theroux, Zachary; Shah, Gopi B; Parkes, William J; Schuck, Christine",The Laryngoscope,47,19

However, there are concerns about dampened immune responses to COVID-19 vaccination among immunocompromised patients, including people living with HIV (PLWH), which may blunt the vaccine's efficacy and durability of protection. This study aimed to assess the qualitative SARS-CoV-2 vaccine immunogenicity among PLWH after vaccination. METHODS We conducted targeted COVID-19 vaccination (all received BNT162b2 vaccine) of PLWH (aged ≥ 55 years per state guidelines) at Yale New Haven Health System and established a longitudinal survey to assess their qualitative antibody responses at 3 weeks after the first vaccination (and prior to receipt of the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine) (visit 1) and at 2-3 weeks after the second vaccination (visit 2) but excluded patients with prior COVID-19 infection. Our goal was to assess vaccine-induced immunity in the population we studied. Qualitative immunogenicity testing was performed using Healgen COVID-19 anti-Spike IgG/IgM rapid testing. Poisson regression with robust standard errors was used to determine factors associated with a positive IgG response. RESULTS At visit 1, 45 of 78 subjects (57.7%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 anti-Spike IgG after the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine. Thirty-nine subjects returned for visit 2. Of these, 38 had positive IgG (97.5%), including 20 of 21 subjects (95.2%) with an initial negative anti-Spike IgG. Our bivariate analysis suggested that participants on an antiretroviral regimen containing integrase strand transfer inhibitors [relative risk (RR) = 1.81, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.92-3.56, p = 0.085] were more likely to seroconvert after the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, while those with a CD4 count < 500 cells/μL (RR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.33-1.05, p = 0.071), and those diagnosed with cancer or another immunosuppressive condition (RR = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.18-1.28, p = 0.15) may have been less likely to seroconvert after the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. The direction of these associations was similar in the multivariate model, although none of these findings reached statistical significance (RRintegrase inhibitor = 1.71, 95% CI: 0.90-3.25, p = 0.10; RRCD4 count = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.39-1.19, p = 0.18; RRcancer or another immunosuppressive condition = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.19-1.33, p = 0.16). With regard to immunogenicity, we were able to record very high rates of new seroconversion following the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. CONCLUSIONS Our study suggests that completing a two-dose series of BNT162b2 vaccine is critical for PLWH given suboptimal seroconversion rates after the first dose and subsequent improved seroconversion rates after the second dose.","Tuan, Jessica J; Zapata, Heidi; Critch-Gilfillan, Terese; Ryall, Linda; Turcotte, Barbara; Mutic, Suzana; Andrews, Laurie; Roh, Michelle E; Friedland, Gerald; Barakat, Lydia; Ogbuagu, Onyema",HIV medicine,47,16

Researchers often lack guidance on an approach to select the best outcomes when evaluating this critically ill population. Studies would be enhanced by incorporating multi-stakeholder preferences to better evaluate clinical care. This manuscript outlines the methodology currently being used to develop a PICU Core Outcome Set (COS). This PICU COS utilizes mixed methods, an inclusive stakeholder approach, and a modified Delphi consensus process that will serve as a resource for PICU research programs. METHODS A Scoping Review of the PICU literature evaluating outcomes after pediatric critical illness, a qualitative study interviewing PICU survivors and their parents, and other relevant literature will serve to inform a modified, international Delphi consensus process. The Delphi process will derive a set of minimum domains for evaluation of outcomes of critically ill children and their families. Delphi respondents include researchers, multidisciplinary clinicians, families and former patients, research funding agencies, payors, and advocates. Consensus meetings will refine and finalize the domains of the COS, outline a battery instruments for use in future studies, and prepare for extensive dissemination for broad implementation. DISCUSSION The PICU COS will be a guideline resource for investigators to assure that outcomes most important to all stakeholders are considered in PICU clinical research in addition to those deemed most important to individual scientists.

The D614G mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is known to markedly enhance viral infectivity but is difficult to detect. Here, we report an effective approach called ""synthetic mismatch integrated crRNA guided Cas12a detection"" (symRNA-Cas12a) to detect the D614 and G614 variants effectively. Using this method, we systemically screened a pool of crRNAs that contain all the possible nucleotide substitutions covering the -2 to +2 positions around the mutation and identify one crRNA that can efficiently increase the detection specificity by 13-fold over the ancestral crRNA. With this selected crRNA, the symRNA-Cas12a assay can detect as low as 10 copies of synthetic mutant RNA and the results are confirmed to be accurate by Sanger sequencing. Overall, we have developed the symRNA-Cas12a method to specifically, sensitively and rapidly detect the SARS-CoV-2 D614G mutation. This article is protected by copyright.

Participants viewed computerized images of food and used computerized visual analogue scales to rate food cravings and inability to resist foods before, during, and after receiving either real or sham tDCS. This study employed a randomized within-subject crossover design; participants received both real and sham tDCS and were blind to the condition. Food cravings ratings were reduced in both conditions, however, the percent change in cravings ratings from pre- to post-stimulation was significantly greater for real stimulation than for sham. The percent change in inability to resist food from pre- to post-stimulation also showed a greater decrease in the real condition than for sham. Post hoc analyses suggest that active prefrontal tDCS acutely and significantly decreased food cravings ratings for sweet foods and carbohydrates more so than sham tDCS. No significant differences were seen in the amount of food ingested between real and sham tDCS. These findings in healthy subjects indicate that tDCS is able to temporarily reduce food cravings and improve the self-reported ability to resist foods.","Goldman, Rachel L; Borckardt, Jeffrey J; Frohman, Heather A; O'Neil, Patrick M; Madan, Alok; Campbell, Laura K; Budak, Amanda; George, Mark S",Appetite,47,1

Presented herein is a study on the comparison of the short-term outcomes, QoL of the patients with the focus on the incidence of RE after both linear and circular stapling in LTG. METHODS From January 2014 to October 2018, 120 patients were analyzed; of these, 42 patients underwent laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy (LATG) with CS (CS group) and 78 patients who underwent totally laparoscopic total gastrectomy (TLTG) with LS (LS group). We examined the results obtained in terms of perioperative outcomes, reflux-related assessments (GerdQ questionnaire and endoscopy findings with all cases; 24-h pH monitoring with limited cases), and EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-STO22. In addition, questionnaires were also supplied to patients and the results were recorded. RESULTS The incidence of anastomotic stenosis (7.1% vs. 0; P < 0.05) and the median intraoperative blood loss (180.0 vs. 100.0 mL; P < 0.05) of the CS group were higher than the LS group. The factor aside, no significant differences were observed between the two groups with regard to the incidence of RE assessed by the QLQ-STO22 reflux scale, the GerdQ scores, endoscopy (in all cases), or the percent time of pH > 7 (in limited cases) (P > 0.05). In the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-STO22, it was noted that the score of constipation [0 (0, 0) vs. 0 (0, 33.3); P = 0.028] and postoperative dysphagia [0 (0, 0) vs. 0 (0, 22.2); P = 0.046] of the LS group in a 1-year follow-up were lower than the CS group. CONCLUSIONS TLTG with LS generated better results than LATG with CS in terms of the incidence of anastomotic stenosis, intraoperative blood loss, and postoperative constipation and dysphagia. Furthermore, when compared with circular stapling, linear stapling in EJS did not increase the incidence of RE assessed by the QLQ-STO22 reflux scale, the GerdQ scores, endoscopy (in all cases), or the percent time of pH > 7 (in limited cases).","Wei, Mingguang; Wang, Nan; Yin, Zhiyuan; Wu, Tao; Zhou, Shuai; Dang, Ling; Zhang, Zhansheng; Wu, Di; Gao, Peng; Zhang, Bo; Yang, Ying; Jia, Guozhan; Wang, Ke; Qiao, Qing; He, Xianli",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,47,28

Although there is abundant information on the epidemiology, risk factors, pathophysiology, and many clinical features of strokes, there is a glaring lack of specific numerical quantitation on the neuroanatomical distribution of strokes.Methods: This retrospective study utilized de-identified reports of radiologic imaging to determine the neurovascular anatomical location of acute ischemic cerebral infarcts in a 637-bed regional hospital in a rural area during the one year interval from October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2019.Results: In this study, during a one-year period, there were 418 acute ischemic strokes and 54.6% (228/418) were in the territory of a single large vessel. Of the single large vessel strokes, 62.3% (142/228) were in a middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory, 12.1% (29/228) in a posterior cerebral artery (PCA) territory, 8.8% (20/228) in a basilar artery distribution, 7.5% (17/228) in a posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) distribution, 6.6% (15/228) in an anterior cerebral artery (ACA) distribution, 1.8% (4/228) in a superior cerebellar artery (SCA) distribution and 0.4% (1/228) in an anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) territory. Subcortical motor strokes accounted for 17.7% (74/418) of the total, subcortical brainstem strokes for 8.1% (34/418) and subcortical sensory strokes for 5% (21/418) of the infarctions. Watershed infarctions accounted for 2.9% (12/418) of the strokes, 9 in the MCA/PCA watershed area and 3 in the MCA/ACA watershed area.Conclusion: This small pilot study illustrates a methodology for collecting the data to substitute specific numerical quantitation for vague generalities about the neuroanatomical distribution of strokes. Such quantification can enable evidence-based data-driven improvements in the care of stroke patients.","Nichols, Larry; Bridgewater, Joshua C; Wagner, Nicholas B; Karivelil, Mathew; Koelmeyer, Himara; Goings, Denise; Hope, Thomas D",Clinical medicine & research,47,16

Imaging HER2 expression in malignant tumors can provide important prognostic and predictive diagnostic information. The use of anti-HER2 tracers labeled with positron-emitting radionuclides may increase the sensitivity of HER2 imaging. The goal of this study was to compare directly 2 approaches for developing anti-HER2 PET tracers: a (124)I-labeled monoclonal antibody and a small (7-kDa) scaffold protein, the Affibody molecule. METHODS The anti-HER2 Affibody Z(HER2:342) and humanized monoclonal antibody trastuzumab were labeled with (124/125)I using p-iodobenzoate (PIB) as a linker. Cellular processing of both tracers by HER2-expressing cells was investigated. The biodistributions of (124)I-PIB-Z(HER2:342) and (125)I-PIB-trastuzumab were compared in BALB/C nu/nu mice bearing HER2-expressing NCI-N87 xenografts using paired labels. Small-animal PET of (124)I-PIB-Z(HER2:342) and (124)I-PIB-trastuzumab in tumor-bearing mice was performed at 6, 24, and 72 h after injection. RESULTS Both radioiodinated Z(HER2:342) and trastuzumab bound specifically to HER2-expressing cells in vitro and specifically targeted HER2-expressing xenografts in vivo. Radioiodinated trastuzumab was more rapidly internalized and degraded, which resulted in better retention of radioactivity delivered by Z(HER2:342). Total uptake of trastuzumab in tumors was higher than that of (124)I-PIB-Z(HER2:342). However, tumor-to-organ ratios were appreciably higher for (124)I-PIB-Z(HER2:342) due to the more rapid clearance of radioactivity from blood and normal organs. The ex vivo results were confirmed by small-animal PET. CONCLUSION The use of the small scaffold targeting Affibody provides better contrast in HER2 imaging than does the monoclonal antibody.","Orlova, Anna; Wållberg, Helena; Stone-Elander, Sharon; Tolmachev, Vladimir","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",47,33

There have been a percentage of poor results due to reappearance, persistence or appearance of new symptoms. Reinterventions of the hiatus are more complicated and are not always accompanied by a satisfactory clinical response. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the long-term results of a series of 20 patients reintervened by laparoscopy and their quality of life. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 20 patients operated on between February 1998 and December 2008 after previous surgery for the hiatus. The mean age of the patients was 56 (19-77) years. A total of 18 patients had been operated on due to GORD or POHH and 2 due to achalasia. They were followed up until December 2008 and a quality of life GIQLI test was performed. RESULTS Of the 20 patients, 13 were operated on by laparoscopy and 7 by laparotomy. The mean pre-operative time was 74 (1-24) months. The reintervention was for GORD and HH in 12 (63%); dysphagia in 4 (21%) and POHH (3). Conversion was 10% and the operating time was 180 (105-300)min. The procedures were: pillar closure and re-Nissen (10), re-Nissen (2), Toupet (2), Collis (1), mesh removal (1), re-myotomy (2), and pexy (1). There was 16% morbidity and no mortality. After a follow up of 68 (1-116) months, 14 patients were symptom-free. The GIQLI score was 106 (97-124), which was less than standard (125). CONCLUSIONS Reintervention of hiatus is reliable and effective over the long-term, but quality of life scores were lower than normal.","Ortiz, Inmaculada; Targarona, Eduard M; Pallares, Lluis; Marinello, Franco; Balague, Carmen; Trias, Manuel",Cirugia espanola,47,11

METHODS A field audit was conducted in five Lower Layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs) in the North East of England. LSOAs were purposively selected from the top and bottom quintiles of the Index of Multiple Deprivation and from urban and rural areas. The FHRS data validity against the field data was measured as Positive Predictive Values (PPV) and sensitivity. Spatial accuracy was evaluated via mean difference in straight line distances between the FHRS coordinates and the field coordinates. RESULTS In all, 182 premises were present in the field, of which 162 were in the FHRS data giving a sensitivity of 89%. Eight outlets recorded in the FHRS data were absent in the field, giving a PPV of 95%.The mean difference in the geographical coordinates of the field audit compared to the FHRS was 110 m, and <100 m for 77% of outlets. CONCLUSIONS After an evaluation of the validity and spatial accuracy of the FHRS data, the results suggest that it is a useful dataset for surveillance of the food environment and for intervention evaluation.","Kirkman, Scott; Hollingsworth, Bruce; Lake, Amelia; Hinke, Stephanie; Sorrell, Stewart; Burgoine, Thomas; Brown, Heather",Journal of public health,47,27

However, only percent food insecurity (IRR = 5.98 * 104, (3.59, 1.07*109)) and percent Black population (IRR = 0.94, (0.90, 0.97)) displayed substantial effects on the test positivity rate. CONCLUSIONS Findings highlight disparities in coronavirus testing among communities with rural minorities. Limited testing in these communities may misrepresent coronavirus incidence.","Hendricks, Brian; Paul, Rajib; Smith, Cassie; Wen, Sijin; Kimble, Wes; Amjad, Ayne; Atkins, Amy; Hodder, Sally",Annals of epidemiology,47,17

METHODOLOGY Otherwise healthy 152 patients, presenting to outpatient clinics with ILI/ARI, were included. Patients had history & physical, CRP, hemogram and nasopharyngeal swabs for rhinovirus A/B, influenza A/B, adenovirus A/B/C/D/E, coronavirus 229E/NL63 and OC43, parainfluenza virus 1/2/3, respiratory syncytial virusA/B, metapneumovirus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila and Bordetella pertussis by PCR and for ABHS culture. RESULTS Median (IR) age was 26.5 (16.5). Time to presentation was shorter in men (p = 0.027). Patients with rhinovirus had lower rates (20%) of myalgia (p = 0.043). Patients with influenza virus had higher rates (97%) of elevated CRP (p = 0.016). Logistic regression revealed that patients with ILI/ARI and CRP ≥ 5 mg/L were 60 times more likely to have influenza virus infection than other viral agents (OR = 60.0, 95% CI = 2.65 to 1,358.2, p = 0.010). Rhinovirus predominated in December (54%), March (36%), and April (33%). Influenza virus predominated in January (51%). Fever was most common with adenovirus (p = 0.198). All GABHS cultures were negative. Atypical organisms and Bordetella pertussis were negative in all but one patient. CONCLUSIONS Influenza virus is the most likely pathogen in ILI/ARI when CRP ≥ 5 mg/L. This might be explained by tissue destruction. Myalgia is rare with rhinovirus probably due to absence of viremia. Negative bacteria by PCR and culture suggest unnecessary antibiotic use in ILI/ARI.","Cinemre, Hakan; Karacer, Cengiz; Yücel, Murat; Öğütlü, Aziz; Cinemre, Fatma Behice; Tamer, Ali; Karabay, Oguz",Journal of infection in developing countries,47,19

Elite cues embedded in mainstream media can influence public opinion on climate change, so it is important to understand whose perspectives are most likely to be represented. Here, I use plagiarism-detection software to analyze the media coverage of a large random sample of business, government, and social advocacy organizations' press releases about climate change (n = 1,768), examining which messages are cited in all articles published about climate change in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and USA Today from 1985 to 2014 (n = 34,948). I find that press releases opposing action to address climate change are about twice as likely to be cited in national newspapers as are press releases advocating for climate action. In addition, messages from business coalitions and very large businesses are more likely than those from other types of organizations to receive coverage. Surprisingly, press releases from organizations providing scientific and technical services are less likely to receive news coverage than are other press releases in my sample, suggesting that messages from organizations with greater scientific expertise receive less media attention. These findings support previous scholars' claims that journalistic norms of balance and objectivity have distorted the public debate around climate change, while providing evidence that the structural power of business interests lends them heightened visibility in policy debates.","Wetts, Rachel",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,47,1

The purpose of the present review is to focus on the safety and the potential advantages of minimally invasive conduit harvesting in coronary surgery. RECENT FINDINGS There is ample evidence in literature that the use of a less invasive approach for conduit (either saphenous vein or radial artery) procurement could yield consistent advantages over the conventional approach, in particular with respect to a lower incidence of wound complications, pain reduction and improved cosmetic results. Nevertheless, some recent studies raised concerns in terms of potential damage occurring to the harvested conduits with the endoscopic approach, which could therefore jeopardize the longevity of the graft itself. SUMMARY Endoscopic conduit harvesting is a well-tolerated and effective procedure. The majority of scientific reports depicted that the minimally invasive approach does not compromise the quality of the harvested conduits and therefore does not lead to a higher incidence of graft failure or cardiac-related events in the mid-long term. The endoscopic technique should be the approach of choice for saphenous vein and radial artery procurement in CABG surgery; recent technical and technological advancements could further improve outcomes.","Bisleri, Gianluigi; Moggi, Annalisa; Muneretto, Claudio",Current opinion in cardiology,47,24

Tremendous efforts and resources have been invested in developing diagnosis, prognosis and treatment strategies to combat the disease. Although nucleic acid detection has been mainly used as the gold standard to confirm this RNA virus-based disease, it has been shown that such a strategy has a high false negative rate, especially for patients in the early stage, and thus CT imaging has been applied as a major diagnostic modality in confirming positive COVID-19. Despite the various, urgent advances in developing artificial intelligence (AI)-based computer-aided systems for CT-based COVID-19 diagnosis, most of the existing methods can only perform classification, whereas the state-of-the-art segmentation method requires a high level of human intervention. In this paper, we propose a fully-automatic, rapid, accurate, and machine-agnostic method that can segment and quantify the infection regions on CT scans from different sources. Our method is founded upon two innovations: 1) the first CT scan simulator for COVID-19, by fitting the dynamic change of real patients' data measured at different time points, which greatly alleviates the data scarcity issue; and 2) a novel deep learning algorithm to solve the large-scene-small-object problem, which decomposes the 3D segmentation problem into three 2D ones, and thus reduces the model complexity by an order of magnitude and, at the same time, significantly improves the segmentation accuracy. Comprehensive experimental results over multi-country, multi-hospital, and multi-machine datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method over the existing ones and suggest its important application value in combating the disease.","Zhou, Longxi; Li, Zhongxiao; Zhou, Juexiao; Li, Haoyang; Chen, Yupeng; Huang, Yuxin; Xie, Dexuan; Zhao, Lintao; Fan, Ming; Hashmi, Shahrukh; Abdelkareem, Faisal; Eiada, Riham; Xiao, Xigang; Li, Lihua; Qiu, Zhaowen; Gao, Xin",IEEE transactions on medical imaging,47,20

Here, we propose and review evidence for a novel mode of innate immunity whereby live, infected host cells induce phagocytes to phagocytose the infected cell, thereby potentially reducing infection. We discuss evidence that host cells, infected by virus, bacteria, or other intracellular pathogens: i) release nucleotides and chemokines as find-me signals, ii) expose on their surface phosphatidylserine and calreticulin as eat-me signals, iii) release and bind opsonins to induce phagocytosis, and iv) downregulate don't-eat-me signals CD47, MHC1 and sialic acid. As long as the pathogens of the host cell are destroyed within the phagocyte, then infection can be curtailed, and if antigens from the pathogens are cross-presented by the phagocyte then an adaptive response would also be induced. Phagocytosis of live, infected cells may thereby mediate innate immunity.","Birkle, T; Brown, G C",Infection and immunity,47,1

Both coiling and the Pipeline embolization device (PED) have been shown to be safe and clinically effective for the treatment of unruptured large and giant intracranial aneurysms; however, the relative cost-to-outcome ratio is unknown. The authors present the first cost-effectiveness analysis to compare the economic impact of the PED compared with coiling or no treatment for the endovascular management of large or giant intracranial aneurysms. METHODS A Markov model was constructed to simulate a 60-year-old woman with a large or giant intracranial aneurysm considering a PED, endovascular coiling, or no treatment in terms of neurological outcome, angiographic outcome, retreatment rates, procedural and rehabilitation costs, and rupture rates. Transition probabilities were derived from prior literature reporting outcomes and costs of PED, coiling, and no treatment for the management of aneurysms. Cost-effectiveness was defined, with the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) defined as difference in costs divided by the difference in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The ICERs < $50,000/QALY gained were considered cost-effective. To study parameter uncertainty, 1-way, 2-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS The base-case model demonstrated lifetime QALYs of 12.72 for patients in the PED cohort, 12.89 for the endovascular coiling cohort, and 9.7 for patients in the no-treatment cohort. Lifetime rehabilitation and treatment costs were $59,837.52 for PED; $79,025.42 for endovascular coiling; and $193,531.29 in the no-treatment cohort. Patients who did not undergo elective treatment were subject to increased rates of aneurysm rupture and high treatment and rehabilitation costs. One-way sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the model was most sensitive to assumptions about the costs and mortality risks for PED and coiling. Probabilistic sampling demonstrated that PED was the cost-effective strategy in 58.4% of iterations, coiling was the cost-effective strategy in 41.4% of iterations, and the no-treatment option was the cost-effective strategy in only 0.2% of iterations. CONCLUSIONS The authors' cost-effective model demonstrated that elective endovascular techniques such as PED and endovascular coiling are cost-effective strategies for improving health outcomes and lifetime quality of life measures in patients with large or giant unruptured intracranial aneurysm.","Wali, Arvin R; Park, Charlie C; Santiago-Dieppa, David R; Vaida, Florin; Murphy, James D; Khalessi, Alexander A",Neurosurgical focus,47,31

MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective analysis of 23 patients (16 men and 7 women; median age, 70 years) with biopsy-proven multifocal renal cell carcinoma (RCC) masses treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA), cryoablation, or microwave ablation (MWA) was performed. Preablation, postablation, and follow-up serum blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) levels were recorded to evaluate the stability of renal function. Technical success, complications, treatment response, oncologic outcome, and overall survival were assessed. RESULTS Biopsy-proven RCCs were treated in 23 patients. Median tumor size was 2.3 cm (range, 1.0-4.0 cm). The mean RENAL (radius, exophytic vs endophytic properties, nearness of tumor to the collecting system or sinus, anterior vs posterior, location relative to polar lines) nephrometry score was 6.3 (range, 4.0-10.0); mean PADUA (preoperative aspects and dimensions used for anatomical) score, 7.8 (range, 6.0-11.0); and mean centrality index (C-index), 3.1 (range, 0.7-6.8). The mean ablation time was 23 minutes (range, 3-24 minutes). Technical success was achieved for 100% of tumors. Of the 49 complications, nine (18%) were classified as Clavien-Dindo grade I complications. Complete response was achieved in 41 of the 49 (84%) tumors. Local progression-free, RCC-specific disease-free, and overall survival rates during the imaging follow-up time (mean, 3.1 years; range, 0.1-9.6 years) were 96% (22/23), 100% (23/23), and 91% (21/23), respectively. CONCLUSION CT-guided percutaneous thermal ablation is a safe, effective, and durable treatment intervention for multifocal renal masses.","Zhou, Wenhui; Uppot, Raul N; Feldman, Adam S; Arellano, Ronald S",AJR.

We sought to understand the impact of geography on aneurysm retreatment in patients enrolled in the Matrix and Platinum Science Trial. MATERIALS AND METHODS Post hoc analysis was performed on data from the Matrix and Platinum Science trial. Patients were stratified as either North American or international. Baseline patient demographics, comorbidities, aneurysm characteristics, procedural complications, and clinical and angiographic outcomes were compared. RESULTS We evaluated 407 patients from 28 North American sites and 219 patients from 15 international sites. Patient demographics differed significantly between North American and international sites. Aneurysms were well occluded postprocedure more often at international than North American sites (P < .001). Stents were used significantly more often at North American sites (32.7% [133 of 407]) compared with international sites (10.0% [22 of 219]; P < .001). At 455 days, there was no difference in the proportion of patients alive and free of disability (P = .56) or with residual aneurysm filling (P = .10). Ruptured aneurysms were significantly more likely to have been retreated at North American sites within the first year (P < .001) and at 2 years (P < .001). Among all patients for whom the treating physician believed there to be Raymond 3 aneurysm filling at follow-up, absolute rates of retreatment at international and North American sites were similar by 2-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Data from the Matrix and Platinum Science Trial demonstrate that aneurysm retreatment occurs with different frequency and at different times in different regions of the world. This trend has critical value when interpreting trials reporting short-term outcomes, especially when judgment-based metrics such as retreatment are primary end points that may or may not take place within the defined study follow-up period. Though these variations can be controlled for and balanced within a given randomized trial, such differences in practice patterns must be accounted for in any attempt to compare outcomes between different trials. Despite these differences, endovascular-treated intracranial aneurysms around the world have similar clinical outcomes.","Turk, A S; Johnston, S C; Hetts, S; Mocco, J; English, J; Murayama, Y; Prestigiacomo, C J; Lopes, D; Gobin, Y P; Carroll, K; McDougall, C",AJNR.

Thoracic radiography and echocardiography at that time revealed an enlarged cardiac silhouette and pericardial effusion; abdominal radiography and ultrasonography revealed ascites. CLINICAL FINDINGS At the initial referral examination 5 weeks later, the dog weighed 37.5 kg (82.5 lb) and appeared clinically normal. The only abnormality detected was a grade I/VI systolic murmur on the left side of the thorax. Echocardiography revealed a large fat- and fluid-filled cystic structure located next to the right ventricle with scant pericardial effusion. Computed tomography revealed a bilobed peripherally contrast-enhancing structure within the right ventral aspect of the pericardium; the right ventricle appeared compressed by the cyst. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME Initial treatment consisted of pericardiocentesis and abdominocentesis to alleviate clinical signs. Thoracoscopic subtotal pericardectomy was performed 6 weeks after the initial treatment. The cyst was completely excised, and multiple adhesions between the visceral and parietal pericardium were transected, without surgical or anesthetic complications. Histologic examination of the cyst revealed chronic inflammation with histiocytic infiltration, suggesting possible foreign body reaction or chronic inflammation and hemorrhage. These findings supported a diagnosis of cystic hematoma of the pericardium. The dog remained clinically normal for at least 16 months after surgery. CLINICAL RELEVANCE This report represents a rare case of intrapericardial cystic hematoma in a dog. Minimally invasive surgery was performed without complications, suggesting that thoracoscopic subtotal pericardectomy is a feasible treatment option for affected dogs.","Chen, Chi-Ya; Fransson, Boel A; Nylund, Adam M",Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,47,19

Despite the unique conditions of these ecosystems, reports on their bacterial diversity are still fragmentary. From this perspective, 60 samples from 14 localities were analyzed. These localities were distributed in coastal sites with differently developed biological soil crusts, inner sites in the McMurdo Dry Valleys with soils lacking of plant coverage, and a site called Icarus Camp, with a crust developed on a thin locally weathered substrate of the underlying parent granitic-rock. Bacterial diversity was studied through 16S rRNA metabarcoding sequencing. Communities diversity, composition and the abundance and composition of different taxonomic groups were correlated to soil physicochemical characteristics. Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria and Proteobacteria dominated these communities. Most phyla were mainly driven by soil granulometry, an often disregarded parameter and other abiotic parameters. Bacterial composition differed greatly among the three macrohabitats, each having a distinct bacterial profile. Communities within the two main habitats (coastal and inner ones) were well differentiated from each other as well, therefore depending on site-specific physicochemical characteristics.

METHODS A randomized and triple-blind (patient, surgeon, and examiner) clinical trial was designed. The individuals were randomly allocated to 2 groups: test and placebo. In the test group, 2 capsules of 4 mg dexamethasone were administered orally. In the placebo group, subjects received 2 capsules with the same characteristics. In both groups, the administration took place 1 hour before the procedure. OHRQoL was assessed by the Brazilian version of Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14). The OHIP-14 questionnaire and the assessment methods for clinical parameters were collected preoperatively and postoperatively. Multilevel linear regression models fitted the associations between preoperative use of corticosteroids and overall and domain-specific OHIP-14 scores over time. RESULTS One hundred fourteen patients were selected for study; however, 21 were excluded for not returning to postoperative control on the seventh day, resulting in 93 patients assessed (test = 44 and placebo = 49). The pain had a negative impact on OHRQoL (P < .01); however, the use of the drug had no statistically significant influence on OHRQoL (P = .62) and the clinical outcomes of pain (P = .63), mouth aperture (P = .05), and edema (P = .69). CONCLUSIONS The use of the 8 mg dexamethasone administered orally before the procedure was not effective on the improvement of the quality of life of patients undergoing dental extraction. However, using the medication seems to result in an improvement in the postoperative period of patients who had impacted teeth. Further research involving the analysis of OHRQoL must be performed, and other dosages and means of administration must be tested.","Pansard, Heitor B; Prado, Mayara C; Marchi, Gabriel F; Sfreddo, Camila S; Skupien, Jovito A",Journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery : official journal of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons,47,29

However, despite the proven safety profile, reported lower complication rates, and technical benefits of robotic surgery, only a few centers in the USA have consistently applied this technology to bariatric surgery. In addition, there are limited studies with relatively small sample sizes comparing robotic-assisted Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RRYGB) with laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB). METHODS Through a retrospective analysis of our database, we compared outcomes of RRYGB versus LRYGB in the treatment of morbid obesity. All patients who underwent RRYGB and LRYGB through the Comprehensive Weight Management Program of the Queen's Medical Center (Honolulu, HI) from January 2007 to December 2009 were included. Outcomes data included weight loss, operative times, and hospital length of stay. All complications were reported. RESULTS 105 patients who underwent RRYGB were compared with 195 patients who received LRYGB. Excess weight loss, estimated blood loss, and length of hospital stay were similar in both groups. There were no mortalities in either group. The RRYGB group experienced a 9.5% complication rate versus 9.7% in LRYGB patients. Operative time was the only statistically significant difference, being approximately 17 min in favor of LRYGB. However, there was a steady decrease in RRYGB operative time with increasing experience. CONCLUSION Our study demonstrates a favorable safety profile with nearly equivalent outcomes and some previously unidentified qualitative benefits of the RRYGB approach to bariatric surgery in a community setting. These results are despite our early experience with the robotic surgery platform and confirm noninferiority of RRYGB versus LRYGB. While the RRYGB operative time was longer than LRYGB, the demonstrated decrease in operative time commensurate with increase in operative experience holds tremendous promise for the future.","Park, Chan W; Lam, Edward C F; Walsh, Teresa M; Karimoto, Maxine; Ma, Adrienne T; Koo, Matthew; Hammill, Chet; Murayama, Kenric; Lorenzo, Cedric S F; Bueno, Racquel",Surgical endoscopy,47,19

Here we present a novel clustering approach, omeClust, for community detection in omics profiles by simultaneously incorporating similarities among measurements and the overall complex structure of the data. RESULTS We show that omeClust outperforms published methods in inferring the true community structure as measured by both sensitivity and misclassification rate on simulated datasets. We further validated omeClust in diverse, multiple omics datasets, revealing new communities and functionally related groups in microbial strains, cell line gene expression patterns, and fetal genomic variation. We also derived enrichment scores attributable to putatively meaningful biological factors in these datasets that can serve as hypothesis generators facilitating new sets of testable hypotheses. AVAILABILITY omeClust is open-source software, and the implementation is available online at http://github.com/omicsEye/omeClust.

This has prompted calls for key workers to receive a variety of special benefits over and above their normal pay. Here, we consider whether two such benefits are justified: a no-fault compensation scheme for harm caused by an epidemic and hazard pay for the risks and burdens of working during an epidemic. Both forms of benefit are often made available to members of the armed forces for the harms, risks and burdens that come with military service. We argue from analogy that these benefits also ought to be provided to key workers during an epidemic because, like the military, key workers face unavoidable harms, risks and burdens in providing essential public good. The amount of compensation should be proportional to the harm suffered and the amount of hazard pay should be proportional to the risk and burden endured. Therefore, key workers should receive the same amount of compensation and hazard pay as the military where the harms, risks and burdens are equivalent. In the UK, a form of no-fault compensation has recently been made available to the surviving families of key workers who suffer fatal COVID-19 infections. According to our argument, however, it is insufficient because it offers less to key workers than is made available to the families of armed services personnel killed on duty.","McConnell, Doug; Wilkinson, Dominic",Journal of medical ethics,47,9

However, there is a lack of understanding of what infectious diseases could be affected by tropical cyclones. This study aimed to examine the impacts of tropical cyclones on notifiable infectious diseases in southeast China. Disease data between 2005 and 2011 from four coastal provinces in southeast China, including Guangdong, Hainan, Zhejiang, and Fujian province, were collected. Numbers of cases of 14 infectious diseases were compared between risk periods and reference periods for each tropical cyclone. Risk ratios (RRs) were calculated to estimate the risks. TCs were more likely to increase the risk of bacillary dysentery, paratyphoid fever, dengue fever and acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (ps < 0.05) than to decrease the risk, more likely to decrease the risk of measles, mumps, varicella and vivax malaria (ps < 0.05) than to increase the risk. In conclusion, TCs have mixed effects on the risk of infectious diseases. TCs are more likely to increase the risk of intestinal and contact transmitted infectious diseases than to decrease the risk, and more likely to decrease the risk of respiratory infectious diseases than to increase the risk. Findings of this study would assist in developing public health strategies and interventions for the reduction of the adverse health impacts from tropical cyclones.","Zheng, Jietao; Han, Weixiao; Jiang, Baofa; Ma, Wei; Zhang, Ying",International journal of environmental research and public health,47,25

The dosage recommendations for bevacizumab are determined on the basis of body weight, and the drug is administered after defined time intervals, when it is presumed to still be above its minimum effective serum concentration. Interindividual and disease-stage-related variations in bevacizumab catabolism, however, can affect the proper dosing of patients, resulting in plasma concentrations which may not be within the optimal therapeutic window for the drug. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) enables the assessment of patients' serum concentrations and allows personalized dosing which has the potential to improve efficacy and reduce side effects. While TMD is often performed using ligand-based assays, mass spectrometry (MS)-based TDM offers improved specificity. Here, we present a robust multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)-MS-based TDM method for the precise quantification of bevacizumab plasma concentrations, based on the controlled oxidation of the methionine-containing peptide, STAYLQMNSLR. The assay shows good linearity (r 2 = 0.9951), robustness, and precision (CVs < 20%) for the quantification of bevacizumab, with a lower limit of quantification (S/N > 10) of 1.8 μg/mL of plasma, without the need for enrichment and requiring less than 1 μL of plasma and less than 6 h from sampling to result.","Gaspar, Vanessa P; Ibrahim, Sahar; Sobsey, Constance A; Richard, Vincent R; Spatz, Alan; Zahedi, René P; Borchers, Christoph H",ACS pharmacology & translational science,47,16

BACKGROUND Vitex negundo L. (VNL) is a medicinal plant with reported efficacy against respiratory diseases and some of the COVID-19 symptoms. Funded by the Department of Science and Technology (DOST), the University of the Philippines - Philippine General Hospital (UP-PGH) is currently conducting clinical trials of VNL and other medicinal plants as adjuvant therapeutic agents against mild cases of COVID-19. The basis for the clinical trials is primarily the pharmacological efficacy of the medicinal plants against respiratory disorders and associated COVID-19 symptoms. OBJECTIVE This study assessed the in silico potential of VNL components against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), an enzyme that plays an important role in COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2. METHOD Phytochemical mining of VNL components from the literature was conducted. A database consisting of 250 known compounds from different parts of VNL was created and screened against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro using the PyRx virtual screening tool. The most promising components were further subjected to in silico absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) analyses using the SwissADME web server and Toxtree software. RESULTS Virtual screening revealed that 102 VNL components in the database had comparable to or better binding affinities toward SARS-COV-2 Mpro than known chemical inhibitors (e.g. N3 and carmofur). It was determined that the active site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro receptor consists of multiple H-donor and acceptor sites; hence, the most stable receptor-ligand complexes are generally formed by VNL ligands that establish effective H-bonding with the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The promising components, representing a ""cocktail"" of potential inhibitors also revealed interesting ADMET properties. CONCLUSION This in silico study identified VNL as a potential single source of a cocktail of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors and a promising adjuvant therapeutic agent against COVID-19 or its symptoms. Furthermore, the study offers a rationale on phytochemical mining from medicinal plants as a means that can be implemented in the early stage of a drug discovery and development program.","Cayona, Ruel; Creencia, Evelyn",Medicinal chemistry (Shariqah (United Arab Emirates)),47,24

Opioids are used to block stimulus of cranial pinning in neurosurgery. We investigated the effect of different infusion rates of sufentanil on SSI during cranial pinning in children under general anaesthesia. METHODS Forty-nine children (2-12 years of age) underwent neurosurgery with pinning. The children were randomized into three groups based on the rate of sufentanil infusion: 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 μg·kg-1·hr.-1. Continuous sufentanil infusion began following neuromuscular blockade administration, at a rate determined by each patient's assigned treatment group. Following preparation for surgery, cranial pinning was performed. Systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressures, along with heart rate and photoplethysmographic data, were continuously recorded from 1 min prior to cranial pinning through 5 min after cranial pinning, in 1-min intervals. SSI was calculated following the completion of surgery. Differences in measured outcomes over time among the three groups were evaluated using a generalized estimation equation. Differences in pinning outcomes in the same group were evaluated with Freidman test. RESULTS We found no statistical differences in long-term SSI that were associated with different infusion rates of sufentanil during cranial pinning. Blood pressures in all groups increased for 2 min after cranial pinning, and then decreased; we found no statistical difference in long-term blood pressure values among the groups. Heart rate increased after pinning in the group that received a low-dose infusion of sufentanil. CONCLUSIONS Since SSI was intended to measure the blunting effects of sufentanil towards the noxious stimulus of cranial pinning, our results suggest that SSI might not be sufficiently sensitive to monitor the nociceptive response in children.

In this context, different factors could worsen sleep quality, but the impact of the pandemic and lockdown on sleep is still mostly unknown. In this cross-sectional study, we describe self-reported sleep disturbances in people without mental health disorders from a large Spanish sample (n = 15,070).Methods: During the early phase of the lockdown (19-26 March), an online survey was launched using a snowball sampling method and included sociodemographic and clinical data along with the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and the Impact of Event Scale (IES). Two items of the IES were employed to assess sleep characteristics. Descriptive and bivariate analysis and logistic regression models were performed.Results: Difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep were reported by 23.9% of the sample and was associated in the regression model with age (OR = 1.008, p = .003), female sex (OR = 1.344, p < .001), an income reduction >50% (OR = 1.248, p = .037), having one (OR = 1.208, p = .029) and two or more (OR = 1.299, p = .035) elderly dependents, drinking alcohol (OR = 1.129, p = .024), and a higher score on DASS-21 depression (OR = 1.148, p < .001), anxiety (OR = 1.218, p < .001), or stress (OR = 1.302, p < .001) subscales, whereas being able to enjoy free time (OR = 0.604, p < .001) and painting or listening to music (OR = 0.853, p = .012) were protective factors.

Our team conducted inductive content analysis to identify emergent themes that characterize shifts in public health risk communication efforts. As a result, we found 7 distinct periods of communication in the first 60 days of the pandemic, each characterized by a differing emphasis on communicating information, individual and collection action, sustaining motivation, and setting social norms. We found that longitudinal risk communication in response to the COVID-19 pandemic shifted as secondary threats arose, while continuing to promote pro-social activities to reduce impact on vulnerable populations. Identifying patterns of risk communication longitudinally allows public health communicators to observe changes in topics and priorities.

At first, whole pathogens were used as vaccine agents, either inactivated or attenuated, to reduce virulence in humans. Safety and tolerability were increased by including only specific proteins as antigens and using cell culture methods, while novel vaccine strategies, like nucleic acid- or vector-based vaccines, hold high promise for the future. Vaccines have generally not been employed as the primary tools in outbreak response, but this might change since advances in medical technology in the last decades have made the concept of developing vaccines against novel pathogens a realistic strategy. Wandering the uncharted territory of a novel pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), we can learn from other human Betacoronaviridae that emerged in the last decades, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. We can identify the most likely target structures of immunity, establish animal models that emulate human disease and immunity as closely as possible, and learn about complex mechanisms of immune interaction such as cross-reactivity or antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). However, significant knowledge gaps remain. What are the correlates of protection? How do we best induce immunity in vulnerable populations like the elderly? Will the immunity induced by vaccination (or by natural infection) wane over time? To date, at least 149 vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 are under development. At the time of writing, at least 17 candidates have already progressed past preclinical studies (in vitro models and in vivo animal experiments) into clinical development. This chapter will provide an overview of this rapidly developing field.","Koch, Till; Fathi, Anahita; Addo, Marylyn M",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,47,6

We analyzed data from field investigations and genetic sequencing to describe the evidence and characteristics of human-to-human transmission in Guangdong Province. Methods: A confirmed COVID-19 case was defined if a suspected case was verified with positive of SARS-CoV-2 in throat swabs, nasal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), or endotracheal aspirates by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR) or genetic sequencing. Field investigations were conducted for each confirmed case. Clinical and demographic data of confirmed cases were collected from medical records. Exposure and travel history were obtained by interview. Results: A total of 1,151 confirmed cases were identified as of February 10, 2020 in Guangdong Province, China. Of them, 697 (60.1%) cases were from 234 cluster infections. Two hundred and fourteen (18.6%) were secondary cases, in which 144 cases were from family cluster infections. With the epidemic continuing, although familial cluster events were dominated, community cluster events increased with a nosocomial event. The whole genomes within the same family cluster infections were identical, and presented a few unique single nucleotide variants (SNVs) compared with SARS-CoV-2 identified on December 2019 in Wuhan. Conclusions: We observed evident human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 in Guangdong, China. Although most of them were from family cluster infections, community and nosocomial infections were increasing.

This paper considers these movement restrictions from a regional point of view. Regions where COVID-19 infection is widespread are considered to be uniform. One of the main factors in the spread of Covid-19 is human mobility. The range of human activity is considered to be the nodal point. However, when movement regulations were established by the government, they were imposed on a formal regional basis, using prefectural borders as clear boundaries, although there were no means of legal enforcement. This resulted in a regional discrimination, that was particularly detrimental to rural areas.

Recent studies indicated critical roles of macrophages and monocytes in CAR-T induced CRS. Here, we report rapid dissipation of CAR-T induced CRS in two patients after receiving Tripterygium glycosides (TG). Effects of triptolide, the major active component of TG, on macrophages and monocytes were examined in animal models. Methods Two patients with CRS after CAR-T cell therapy (for hematological malignancy) received TG (50 mg, p.o.). Flow cytometry analysis and single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) were conducted to examine the effects of TG on immune cells. Potential effects of triptolide were also examined ex vivo using patient-derived monocytes, as well as in mice. Findings Rapid alleviation of fever and cytokine storm was observed within 72 hours after TG treatment. Blood concentration of triptolide ranged from 21 to 154 ng/mL during treatment. Flow cytometry and scRNAseq showed selective depletion of monocytes with minimal impact on CAR-T cells in both patients.

We therefore set out to analyze serial blood samples from mild-to-moderately ill patients in order to define the immune landscapes for differently progressed disease stages. Methods: Twenty-two COVID-19 patients were subjected to consecutive venipuncture within seven days after diagnosis or admittance to hospital. Flow cytometry was performed to analyze peripheral blood immune cell compositions and their activation as were plasma levels of cytokines and SARS-CoV-2 specific immunoglobulins. Healthy donors served as controls. Results: Integrating the kinetics of plasmablasts and SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies allowed for the definition of three disease stages of early COVID-19. The incubation phase was characterized by a sharp increase in pro-inflammatory monocytes and terminally differentiated cytotoxic T cells. The latter correlated significantly with elevated concentrations of IP-10. Early acute infection featured a peak in PD-1+ cytotoxic T cells, plasmablasts and increasing titers of virus specific antibodies. During late acute infection, immature neutrophils were enriched whereas all other parameters returned to baseline. Conclusion: Our findings will help to define landmarks that are indispensable for the refinement of new anti-viral and anti-inflammatory therapeutics, and may also inform clinicians to optimize treatment and prevent fatal outcome.","MuÌller, M.; Volzke, J.; Subin, B.; Schmidt, C.

Nearly 1.5 billion children - more than half of the world's student population - are being kept away from school due to pandemic response measures. Nationwide school closures are in force in more than 180 countries while in many others there are localized closures which threaten to become countrywide. The disruption and closure of schools around the world will have a negative impact not just on children's right to education but on other human rights including their right to adequate food. More than 350 million schoolchildren in countries with nationwide and localized closures, might not have access to regular school feeding and nutrition services during the pandemic. In countries where schools remain open, families may also be affected by economic slowdown and fluctuating food prices, and it will be more important to ensure that children have access to nutritious school meals and nutrition services. Where school feeding services continue, there are concerns over gaps in water and sanitation infrastructure and the inability to comply with physical distancing and hygiene measures, as required by governments and by the World Health Organization (WHO). In some cases, fear of infection can also keep children away from school and from having access to school feeding.

Since it was first identified, COVID-19 has infected more than one hundred million people worldwide, with more than two million fatalities. This study focuses on the interpretation of the distribution of COVID-19 in Egypt to develop an effective forecasting model that can be used as a decision-making mechanism to administer health interventions and mitigate the transmission of COVID-19. Methods: A model was developed using the data collected by the Egyptian Ministry of Health and used it to predict possible COVID-19 cases in Egypt. Results: Statistics obtained based on time-series and kinetic model analyses suggest that the total number of CO?VID-19 cases in mainland Egypt could reach 11076 per week (March 1, 2020 through January 24, 2021) and the number of simple regenerations could reach 12. Analysis of the ARIMA (2, 1, 2) and (2, 1, 3) sequences shows a rise in the number of COVID-19 events. Conclusion: The developed forecasting model can help the government and medical personnel plan for the imminent conditions and ensure that healthcare systems are prepared to deal with them.","Sabry, Ibrahim ElWakil Mohamed Amir Hussain Idrisi Abdel-Hamid Ismail Mourad",Eurasian Journal of Medicine and Oncology,47,1

As we all know that we are in global pandemic due to Covid-19 situation now, hence, there is a demand occurring in health care services and continuous monitoring. Moreover, prediction of abnormalities at an early stage will be crucial for a person in diagnosis. Hence, in this paper we have developed and compared the performance of three machine learning algorithms such as Decision Tree Classifier (DTC), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Random Forest (RF). Each algorithm is tested with datasets of 100, 200, 500 & 1000 users respectively. Further, threshold values have been identified by consulting with doctors for accurate disease prediction based on the vital signals collected by various sensors. The three algorithms used are based on supervised learning, where the output is predicted based on the training of the developed classifier. From the results, it is observed that the accuracy in disease prediction using RF is 0.99 & outperformed when compared with state of the art for datasets of 1000 users. © 2021 IEEE.","Priya, B.

Our framework adapts key neural architecture parameters to search for an embedded DNN with a low hardware overhead, which can be deployed in wearable edge devices to analyse the bio-signal data and to extract the relevant information, such as arrhythmia and seizure. Our framework also enables hardware-aware DNN architecture search using genetic algorithms by imposing user requirements and hardware constraints (storage, FLOPs, etc.) during the exploration stage, thereby limiting the number of networks explored. Moreover, BioNetExplorer can also be used to search for DNNs based on the user-required output classes; for instance, a user might require a specific output class due to genetic predisposition or a pre-existing heart condition. The use of genetic algorithms reduces the exploration time, on average, by 9x, compared to exhaustive exploration. We are successful in identifying Pareto-optimal designs, which can reduce the storage overhead of the DNN by ~30MB for a quality loss of less than 0.5%. To enable low-cost embedded DNNs, BioNetExplorer also employs different model compression techniques to further reduce the storage overhead of the network by up to 53x for a quality loss of<0.2%.","Prabakaran, Bharath Srinivas; Akhtar, Asima; Rehman, Semeen; Hasan, Osman; Shafique, Muhammad",,47,28

We used the Failure Modes and Effect Analysis tool (a systematic, prospective method of process mapping) to identify how a complex task might fail and assess the relative impact of different failures. The decision-to-delivery was 17 minutes, which we considered to be successful. However, a number of operational deficiencies were identified. The main failures related to lack of situational awareness, ill-fitting personal protective equipment and difficulties communicating between theatre and the neonatal teams located outside, posing serious potential risks to safe neonatal care. Subsequently, we have modified our SOP to include a communication check, implemented communication training for the neonatal team and organised further simulation training for theatre staff unfamiliar with COVID-19 considerations.","Curtis, S.; Flower, R.; Emanuel-Kole, L.; Nadarajah, P.",Bmj Simulation &amp; Technology Enhanced Learning,47,16

Our objectives were to analyze mortality and its independent risk factors, and to assess the occurrence of a favorable evolution, defined as hospital discharge, or stay at the ward, or transfer from ICU to ward. Patients were stratified int o 4 subgroups: admission to the ward with pneumonia and/or oxygen requirement (WARD; n = 100); ICU admission (ICU; n = 87); ICU admission with requirement of mechanical ventilation (ICU-MV; n = 56), and ICU-MV plus septic shock (ICU-MV-SS; N = 29). Mortality at 28 days was 26.1% for the entire group, 14.0% for WARD group, 18.4% for ICU, 44.6% for ICU-MV, and 55.2% for ICU-MV-SS. Mean survival time (days) was 25.6 ± 0.6 (WARD); 25.3 ± 0.7 (ICU); 20.8 ± 1.2 (ICU-MV) and 18.2 ± 1.8 (ICU-MV-SS). Independent predictors of mortality were MV, septic shock and weight.

The combined regimen of rituximab (RTX) and tacrolimus (TAC) has an excellent effect on this kind of non-responsive iMN patients; however, the optimal dose is still unclear. In this retrospective study, we comapred the efficacy and safety of ultra-low dose RTX plus low-dose TAC therapy versus standard TAC monotherapy in patients with non-responsive iMN. MATERIALS AND METHODS Sixty-seven Chinese non-responsive iMN patients were included. There were 41 patients received standard tacrolimus monotherapy (TAC) and 26 patients received ultra-low dose rituximab plus low dose tacrolimus (RTX/TAC) combination therapy. All patients were observed for 12 months. RESULTS 18 patients (18/26, 69.2%) in the RTX/TAC group and 17 patients (17/41, 41.5%) in the TAC group achieved clinical response after 12-month follow-up (P=0.044). The median time for achieving response in the two groups was 3.0 months. As indicated by Kaplan-Meier curve, the response rate in the RTX/TAC group was higher than that in the TAC group (P=0.015). 24-hour proteinuria, serum albumin, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and serum creatinine in the two groups were comparable at baseline; howerver, after 12-month follow up, they were significantly improved in the RTX/TAC group compared with the TAC group (P<0.05). B-cell depletion was achieved in all patients in the RTX/TAC group during the whole follow-up period. Pneumonia, urinary tract infections and glucose intolerance were the major side effects observed in this study. All adverse events were mild, and the cumulative incidence was lower in the RTX/TAC group compared with that in the TAC group (9 (34.6%) vs 27 (65.9%), P=0.023). CONCLUSION The combination of ultra-low dose rituximab and low dose tacrolimus is more effective in inducing proteinuria response, improving eGFR and serum albumin in non-responsive iMN patients than standard tacrolimus monotherapy. The combined treatment also has higher safty.","Zhu, Fan; Chu, Xiaoxin; Guo, Yi; Li, Yinzheng; Cao, Chujin; Wu, Jianliang; Xu, Huzi; Deng, Xuan; Li, Junhua; Liu, Xiaocheng; Yao, Ying; Zeng, Rui",American journal of translational research,47,12

Many hospitals continue to experience problems months or years after occupying the new premises; some of these could have been avoided by infection control involvement earlier in the project. The importance of infection control must be recognized by the chief executive of the hospital trust and project teams overseeing the development. Clinical user groups and contractors must also be made aware of infection control issues. It is vital that good working relationships are built up between the infection control team (ICT) and all these parties. ICTs need the authority to influence the process. This may require their specific recognition by the Private Finance Initiative National Unit, the Department of Health or other relevant authorities. ICTs need training in how to read design plans, how to write effective specifications, and in other areas with which they may be unfamiliar. The importance of documentation and record keeping is paramount. External or independent validation of processes should be available, particularly in commissioning processes. Building design in relation to infection control needs stricter national regulations, allowing ICTs to focus on more local usage issues.

Recrudescence of neurotropic coronavirus due to loss of T cell-mediated immune control provided an experimental model to test T cell vaccination efficacy in the absence of Ab. Challenge virus was rapidly controlled in vaccinated Ab-deficient mice coincident with accelerated recruitment of memory CD8+ T cells and enhanced effector function compared with primary CD8+ T cell responses. In contrast to primary effectors, reactivated memory cells persisted in the CNS at higher frequencies and retained ex vivo cytolytic activity. Nevertheless, despite earlier and prolonged T cell-mediated control in the CNS of vaccinated mice, virus ultimately reactivated. Apparent loss of memory CD8+ effector function in vivo was supported by a prominent decline in MHC expression on CNS resident target cells, presumably reflecting diminished IFN-gamma. Severely reduced MHC expression on glial cells at the time of recrudescence suggested that memory T cells, although fully armed to exert antiviral activity upon Ag recognition in vitro, are not responsive in an environment presenting few if any target MHC molecules. Paradoxically, effective clearance of viral Ag thus affords persisting virus a window of opportunity to escape from immune surveillance. These studies demonstrate that vaccine-induced T cell memory alone is unable to control persisting virus in a tissue with strict IFN-dependent MHC regulation, as evident in immune privileged sites.","Ramakrishna, Chandran; Atkinson, Roscoe A; Stohlman, Stephen A; Bergmann, Cornelia C",Journal of immunology,47,1

In some cases, this may be a life-saving transfer to a higher level of care. US Central Command (CENTCOM) has provided valuable guidance for COVID-19 management in the operational environment,1 and has proposed the National Early Warning System 2 (NEWS2) scoring tool as a useful adjunct to gauging illness severity. NEWS2, however, does not consider co-morbidities, such as diabetes or chronic cardiac disease, which could worsen the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 patients. Thus, NEWS2 fails to address such factors during the risk stratification of patients to a higher level of care. To address this concern, June 2020, 3rd Medical Brigade, Operation Spartan Shield (OSS) developed the COVID-19 Army Rapid Assessment Tool (CARAT) with inputs from clinicians and researchers (The Team). The CARAT is a clinical scoring system, modified from the NEWS2, which combines the effects of co-morbid disease with the current physiological condition of a COVID-19 patient. The Team obtained clinical data for 105 patients from the CENTCOM area of responsibility (AOR), who presented to a military treatment facility (MTF) symptomatic for, and testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, during the time period of June to mid-August 2020. Each patient was retrospectively assigned a CARAT score based on his or her initial presentation. Preliminary review of data suggested a CARAT value of 4 or greater was an indicator for risk of further deterioration. Patients were then grouped into two categories: patients who received transfer to a higher level of care, versus ""stay-in-place"" supportive care. Results showed that 100% of patients with a score ≥4 had been transferred to a higher echelon of care, compared to 2% of patients with scores less than 4. A Fisher's exact test demonstrated a statistically significant difference between these two groups (p is less than 0.001). Interestingly, when compared with the NEWS2 score, the CARAT identified 9 individuals for transfer to a higher level of care, of whom only one patient was identified by the NEWS2, clearly underscoring the significance of CARAT despite small sample size. We therefore recommend that CARAT be further validated in predicting disease severity and need for emergent evacuation in larger patient settings.","Walters, Michael J; Aden, Brandon L; Kliewer, Maurice L; Bruehl, Charles L; Mannion, Elizabeth M; Smith, Angela L; Clark, Adam D; Sachdeva, Mohit; Teplicki, Henry R; Honea, Christopher W; Ward, Donna E; Venable, Chuck A; Wolloff, Stephanie A",Medical journal,47,29

Cytokine responses were correlated with virus replication. Virus was detected in plasma and tissue from day 14 postinfection (p.i.) onward, peaked at 56 to 70 days, and declined greatly by 70 days. Virus replication was highest in the thymus, followed by spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, and cervical lymph nodes. Baseline cytokine levels were highest in the mesenteric lymph nodes and lowest in the cervical lymph nodes. Cytokine upregulation after FIV infection was most dramatic in the cervical lymph nodes, with the greatest increase in interleukin-10 (IL-10) and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma). Cytokine transcription in the mesenteric lymph node increased above baseline by day 14 p.i. for IFN-gamma, IL-12p40, IL-4, and IL-10, while elevations in the spleen were mainly for IFN-gamma, IL-12p40 and IL-10. An increase in IFN-gamma, IL-10, and IL-12p40 occurred in the thymus at day 56 p.i., concomitant with the onset of thymitis. In general, type 2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) were increased greater than 1 log over baseline, while the elevations in type 1 cytokines were less than 1 log. In the tissues tested, CD4(+) cells were the primary source of IL-2, IL-4, and IL-10. Both CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells produced IFN-gamma, while no cytokine mRNA was detected in B cells. These results demonstrate the presence of a heterogeneous cytokine response in lymphoid tissues during the primary stage of FIV infection. The nature and intensity of the response differed from one compartment to the other and, in the case of the thymus, also with inflammatory changes. Although limited in scope, the present study confirms the usefulness of the FIV infection model in studying early cytokine events that lead to the secondary subclinical carrier state typical of most lentivirus infections.","Dean, G A; Pedersen, N C",Journal of virology,47,17

The response within the newborn group was homogeneous, resulting in high virus titers, maximal villous atrophy and comparatively slow regeneration. In general, virus titers were lower, villous atrophy was less severe and regeneration more rapid in both older groups than in the newborn pigs. However, the response varied greatly in the older groups. The 3-week-old group was divided into two populations. The major population had low virus titers and developed partial villous atrophy, whereas the minor population had marked villous atrophy and virus titers comparable to those of the newborn pigs. These observations support the hyposthesis that the accelerated replacement of villous epithelium in the small intestine of pigs during the first 3 weeks contributes to the innate age-dependent resistance to transmissible gastroenteritis. The accelerated replacement of villous epithelial cells in older pigs contributes to resistance in two ways. The increased proliferative capacity of crypt epithelium results in a more rapid regeneration of atrophic villi; and the comparatively young villous absorptive cells resulting from accelerated replacement produce less virus per cell than the older ones of the newborn pig.","Moon, H W; Kemeny, L J; Lambert, G; Stark, S L; Booth, G D",Veterinary pathology,47,1

RESULTS Responses were received from 76 departments (88%): 73 reported that their ED had a disaster plan, with 60 (79%) having a contingency plan for chemical, 57 (75%) for biological, and 53 (70%) for radiological incidents. Specific staff training for managing patients from a conventional mass casualty incident was given in 83% of EDs, falling to 66% for a CBR incident. Forty-three per cent reported that their plan involved staff managing contaminated patients, but availability of personal protective equipment and decontamination facilities varied widely. Although 41% believed their ED could cope with a maximum of 20 patients in the first 2 hours after a conventional incident, this increased to 71% for a CBR incident. Staff training was considered the main funding priority (59%). CONCLUSIONS This survey raises significant questions about the level of preparedness of Australian EDs for dealing with patients from both conventional and CBR incidents. Hospitals need to review their plans and functionality openly and objectively to ensure that their perceived preparedness is consistent with reality. In addition, they urgently require guidance as to reasonable expectations of their capacity. To that end, we recommend further development of national standards in hospital disaster planning and preparedness.","Edwards, Nicholas A; Caldicott, David G E; Aitken, Peter; Lee, Christine C; Eliseo, Tony",Critical care and resuscitation : journal of the Australasian Academy of Critical Care Medicine,47,17

In this paper, a novel phylogenomic method, named as Base-Base Correlation (BBC), has been proposed to infer phylogenetic relationships from complete genomes, with particular emphasis on coronavirus phylogeny. Following the high-profile publicity of SARS outbreaks, a renewed interest in coronavirus has been promoted and two novel human coronaviruses (NL63 and HKU1) have been identified. Coronavirus phylogenomics based on BBC is well consistent with that of previous studies.

This report summarizes the results of this ongoing investigation, which, as of December 30, had identified 85 S. Typhimurium human isolates with the outbreak strain from 31 states. In a multistate case-control study, exposure to frogs was found to be significantly associated with illness (63% of cases versus 3% of controls; matched odds ratio [mOR] = 24.4). Among 14 case-patients who knew the type of frog, all had exposure to an exclusively aquatic frog species, the African dwarf frog. Environmental samples from aquariums containing aquatic frogs in four homes of case-patients yielded S. Typhimurium isolates matching the outbreak strain. Preliminary traceback information has indicated these frogs likely came from the same breeder in California. Reptiles (e.g., turtles) and amphibians (e.g., frogs) have long been recognized as Salmonella carriers, and three multistate outbreaks of human Salmonella infections associated with turtle contact have occurred since 2006.

Mortality rates reached 50 percent by 1968 and 75 percent by 1970. Contaminated samples of T. pallidum were brought to the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, a World Health Organization center for the study of treponematoses. There it was established that the causative agent was filterable, the heart was the target organ, and the agent was determined by electron microscopy to be a coronavirus. Also, complement fixing antibodies to the human coronaviruses 229E (two way cross) and 0C43 (one way cross) were demonstrated in surviving rabbits. Immunofluorescent staining with anti-229E serum localized fluorescence in the interstitial tissue of the myocardium. Antiserum to RbCV cross reacted with coronaviruses of three other diseases, feline infectious peritonitis (FIPV), canine coronavirus diarrhea (CCV), and transmissible gastroenteritis (TGEV) by radioimmunoassay. In plaque neutralization tests, a slight reduction was observed against TGE and CCV but not against FIP. Antiserum to 229EV, CCV, FIPV and to a lesser degree TGEV partially blocked the clinical course of the disease and reduced mortality. Slight protection was afforded rabbits by vaccination with, in descending order of survivors, CCV, FIPV, and TGEV. Vaccination with calf diarrhea coronavirus (CDCV) provided no protection.","Small, J D; Woods, R D",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,47,1

A heptamer, CCCUUUA, and a potential pseudoknot found in the overlap were predicted to be required for the frameshift. A 68-nucleotide (nt) cDNA fragment containing these elements was inserted between the GLV 5' 631-nt cDNA and the out-of-frame luciferase gene that required a -1 frameshift within the 68-nt fragment for expression. Giardia lamblia trophozoites transfected with the transcript of this construct showed a frameshift frequency at 1.7%, coinciding with the polymerase-to-capsid protein ratio in GLV. The heptamer is required for the frameshift but can be replaced with other sequences of the same motif. Mutations placing stop codons in the 0 or -1 frame, located directly before or after the heptamer, implicated the latter as the site for the -1 frameshift. Shortening or destroying the putative stem decreased the frameshift efficiency threefold; the efficiency was fully recovered by mutations to restore the stem. Deleting 18 nt from the 3' end of the 68-nt fragment, which formed the second stem in the putative pseudoknot, had no effect on the frequency of the frameshift. Chemical probing of the RNA secondary structure in the frameshift region showed that bases resistant to chemical modification were clustered in the putative stem structures, thus confirming the presence of the postulated stem-loop, while all the bases in the loop were chemically modified, thus ruling out their capability of forming a pseudoknot. These results confirmed the conclusion based on data from the mutation study that there is but a simple stem-loop downstream from the heptamer. Together, they constitute the structural elements for a -1 ribosomal frameshift in the GLV transcript.","Li, L; Wang, A L; Wang, C C",Journal of virology,47,16

We aimed to investigate survival rates, clinical outcomes and costs of anti-TNF agents in a large population of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS Health insurance data from 22,082 IBD patients were provided by Achmea Healthcare. Time to anti-TNF discontinuation, treatment intensification, corticosteroid initiation and hospitalisation were analysed in patients starting on anti-TNF treatment from January 2008 until December 2014. Treatment regimens were analysed at different time points. RESULTS In this cohort, 855 and 1199 subjects started infliximab and adalimumab treatment, respectively. The median time to anti-TNF discontinuation was 600 days (IQR 156-1693). The proportion of subjects receiving intensified treatment increased over time (infliximab at 3 vs. 24 months: 22.2% vs. 33.6%, p = 0.01; adalimumab at 3 vs. 24 months: 10.5% vs. 19.3%, p < 0.001). Cessation of anti-TNF treatment was less common in Crohn's disease patients (HR 0.79, p = 0.001) and in patients receiving intensified treatment (HR 0.62, p = 0.001). Immunomodulator use was associated with a longer time to corticosteroid initiation (HR 0.80, p = 0.048), but not with longer drug survival (HR 0.99, p = 0.617). Hospitalisation was more common in Crohn's patients (HR 1.49, p = 0.011). Corticosteroid initiation was lower in Crohn's patients (HR 0.57, p < 0.001) and in patients using infliximab (HR 0.55, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Discontinuation of anti-TNF therapy occurred earlier than previously reported and was associated with a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis and non-intensified anti-TNF treatment. Immunomodulator use at the start of anti-TNF treatment was associated with a longer time to corticosteroid initiation, but not with longer drug survival.","Bots, S J A; Hoekman, D R; Benninga, M A; Ponsioen, C Y; D'Haens, G R; Löwenberg, M",The Netherlands journal of medicine,47,22

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the safety of percutaneous biliary stenting and to analyze whether percutaneous biliary stenting combined with radiotherapy (RT) prolonged the stent patency and survival time of patients. In total, the cases of 38 patients with unresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma that underwent percutaneous biliary stenting at the Navy General Hospital were retrospectively reviewed in the present study. Uncovered metallic stenting (UMS) combined with RT was administered to 25 patients, and UMS alone was administered to 13 patients. The records of early complications subsequent to percutaneous biliary stenting were collected, and the stent patency and survival times of patients were analyzed and compared between the two groups. The technical success rate of the procedure was 100% and the successful drainage rate was 86.8%. The overall early complication rate was 15.8% and the procedure-associated mortality rate was 2.6%. The median stent patency was 326 days in the UMS+RT group and 196 days in the UMS group (P=0.022). The UMS+RT group (median, 367 days) demonstrated a longer survival time compared with the UMS group (median, 267 days; P=0.025).

Age-matched uninfected calves were used for comparison. Ileal mucosal lymphocytes were collected, quantitated, and phenotyped to determine whether changes in lymphocyte composition occurred in infected animals. We observed significantly larger numbers of intraepithelial CD8+ T lymphocytes in ileal mucosae from acutely infected calves compared with those from control animals. In addition, a proportion of intraepithelial CD4+ T cells from acutely infected calves coexpressed CD25, whereas there was an absence of coexpressed CD25 on CD4+ T cells from control calves. Ex vivo reverse transcriptase PCR of RNA from intraepithelial lymphocytes from control calves showed a cytokine expression pattern consisting of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), while intraepithelial lymphocytes from calves with cryptosporidiosis expressed IFN-gamma but not TNF-alpha. Together, the results indicate that changes occur in the ileal intraepithelial lymphocyte population coincidently with Cryptosporidium parvum-induced enteric disease.","Wyatt, C R; Brackett, E J; Perryman, L E; Rice-Ficht, A C; Brown, W C; O'Rourke, K I",Infection and immunity,47,33

Method: A 62-year-old female with history of GBD and inactive Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO) was admitted with progressive exophthalmos in her right eye (RE) and diagnosed with GO reactivation the previous month. Results: On examination, dilated and tortuous conjunctival blood vessels, chemosis and exophthalmos were observed in the RE. There was an asymmetry in the intraocular pressures of 20 mmHg in the RE and 10 mmHg in the LE. Laboratory results showed normal thyroid function and positivity of some of the antibodies related to immune thyroid disorders. Neuroimaging showed an early and abnormal filling of the cavernous sinus (CS) and an enlarged superior ophthalmic vein. Consequently, the diagnosis of CCF was established. Interventional treatment was performed with good clinical outcome and no recurrence after 6 months of follow-up. Conclusions: CCFs are abnormal arteriovenous connections between the carotid arteries and CS. CCF picture can mimic the GO's manifestations. Thus, CCF should be considered in the differential diagnosis of GO, especially in unilateral, asymmetric, and atypical cases. We reported herein a case of CCF in a patient diagnosed with GBD, having a previous history of inactive GO, a diagnostic challenge, since the first presumed diagnosis in patients with GBD is always GO.

Inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) cause acute liver injury while serum detectability indicates systemic inflammation. AIMS: We explored a link between systemic IL-6, related acute phase proteins and liver injury in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: 655 patients with suspected COVID-19 were screened in the emergency department at the University Hospital of Innsbruck, Austria, between February and April 2020. 96 patients (â¼15%) were hospitalized with COVID-19. 15 patients required intensive-care treatment (ICT). Plasma aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and gamma glutamyl transferase, as well as IL-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were determined by standard clinical assays. RESULTS: Of all hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 41 (42%) showed elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) concentration. COVID-19 patients with elevated AST exhibited significantly higher IL-6 (p < 0.001), ferritin (p < 0.001), LDH (p < 0.001) and CRP (p < 0.05) serum concentrations compared to patients with normal AST. Liver injury correlated with systemic IL-6 (p < 0.001), CRP (p < 0.001), ferritin (p < 0.001) and LDH (p < 0.001) concentration. In COVID-19 patients requiring ICT, correlations were more pronounced.

A meme may be perceived as unique since it has the ability to express numerous points of view, such as one?s or a group of society?s political view. The COVID-19 pandemic which is currently threatening the world?s public health starting from the end of 2019 introduces an enormous disruption in various fields, including the social aspect in Indonesia. One of the difficulties that the citizens felt is their obligation to do their work from home, as a form of health quarantine, along with physical distancing avoiding interactions that occurred in workplaces. As a government policy, it?s only normal that a pro-contra rises in the society. One of the flaws in the policy is the existence of professions which doesn?t allow their work to be done at home, specifically for professions such as fishermen, farmers, and construction workers that are also found at the memes which this study analysed. To look at how a public discourse is done through a meme, the study uses Barthes? Semiotic Analysis Model in revealing the myth that exists in the meme found in the social media platforms during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study finds how the memes in the analysis represent a perceived flaw in the Work From Home policy when the policy is directed to several types of professions in Indonesia, as well as it is a form of political critique.Keywords: Work From Home, COVID-19, semiotic, meme�ABSTRAKSuatu meme mampu menggambarkan sebuah fenomena yang pada umumnya dirangkai melalui suatu gambar yang diikuti dengan deskripsi yang mendukung representasi suatu makna yang hendak disampaikan seorang pembuat meme. Meme juga dianggap unik oleh karena kemampuannya mengekspresikan berbagai sudut pandang, seperti pandangan politik seseorang atau sekelompok masyarakat. Pandemi COVID-19 yang tengah mengancam kesehatan masyarakat dunia sejak akhir tahun 2019 menghadirkan disrupsi yang besar dalam berbagai sektor, termasuk aspek sosial di Indonesia. Salah satu kesulitan yang dialami masyarakat adalah kewajiban setiap individu untuk melaksanakan pekerjaan mereka dari rumah masing-masing atau yang sering disebut sebagai ?Work From Home?, sebagai bentuk kekarantinaan kesehatan dengan pembatasan fisik dari interaksi yang terjadi di tempat berbagai pekerjaan dilakukan. Selayaknya suatu kebijakan pemerintah, resolusi kesehatan ini menimbulkan pro-kontra bagi masyarakat Indonesia. Salah satu kekurangan dari kebijakan ini adalah keberadaan profesi yang tidak memungkinkan pekerjaannya untuk dikerjakan di rumah, khususnya untuk profesi seperti nelayan, petani, dan tukang bangunan yang juga ditemukan pada ketiga meme yang dianalisis pada penelitian ini.

Traditional medicines represent likely sources of relatively inexpensive drugs for symptomatic management as well as potential libraries of new therapeutic approaches. Leveraging this potential requires hard evidence for efficacy that separates science from pseudoscience. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a review of non-Western medical systems and developed case studies that illustrate the epistemological and practical translative barriers that hamper their transition to integration with Western approaches. We developed a new data analytics approach, in silico convergence analysis, to deconvolve modes of action, and potentially predict desirable components of TM-derived formulations based on computational consensus analysis across cultures and medical systems. RESULTS: Abstraction, simplification and altered dose and delivery modalities were identified as factors that influence actual and perceived efficacy once a medicine is moved from a non-Western to Western setting. Case studies on these factors highlighted issues with translation between non-Western and Western epistemologies, including those where epistemological and medicinal systems drive markets that can be epicenters for zoonoses such as the novel Coronavirus. The proposed novel data science approach demonstrated the ability to identify and predict desirable medicinal components for a test indication, pain. CONCLUSIONS: Relegation of traditional therapies to the relatively unregulated nutraceutical industry may lead healthcare providers and patients to underestimate the therapeutic potential of these medicines. We suggest three areas of emphasis for this field: First, vertical integration and embedding of traditional medicines into healthcare systems would subject them to appropriate regulation and evidence-based practice, as viable integrative implementation mode. Second, we offer a new Bradford-Hill-like framework for setting research priorities and evaluating efficacy, with the goal of rescuing potentially valuable therapies from the nutraceutical market and discrediting those that are pseudoscience. Third, data analytics pipelines offer new capacity to generate new types of TMS-inspired medicines that are rationally-designed based on integrated knowledge across cultures, and also provide an evaluative framework against which to test claims of fidelity and efficacy to TMS made for nutraceuticals.","Jansen, C; Baker, J D; Kodaira, E; Ang, L; Bacani, A J; Aldan, J T; Shimoda, L M N; Salameh, M; Small-Howard, A L; Stokes, A J; Turner, H; Adra, C N",J Ethnopharmacol,47,32

METHODS: Multicentre randomised case-control study that involved 18 patients with COVID-19 related anosmia or severe hyposmia for more than 30 days. Nine patients were prescribed systemic prednisone and nasal irrigation with betamethasone, ambroxol and rinazine for 15 days. The other 9, untreated, patients were used as controls. The olfactory function was evaluated with CCCRC test at 20 and 40 days from the first evaluation. RESULTS: In the control group, a median olfactory score of 20 (IQR 30) was detected at baseline. At the 20-day control there was no significant improvement in olfactory function. The improvement in olfactory performance became significant at the 40-day follow-up compared to baseline scores [60 (IQR 60) versus 20 (IQR 30)]. In the treatment group, patients had a mean olfactory score of 10 (IQR 15) at initial control.

This project has evaluated if the schedule of LC screening or procedures has been interrupted /delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An international survey evaluated the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on clinical practice and clinical trials from March 2020 to June 2020, as the first phase of a multicentre, international and observational project. The focus was on patients with hepatocellular carcinoma or intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, cared for around the world during the first COVID-19 pandemic wave. RESULTS: Ninety-one centres expressed interest to participate and 76 were included in the analysis, from Europe, South America, North America, Asia and Africa (73.7%, 17.1%, 5.3%, 2.6% and 1.3% per continent, respectively). Eighty-seven per cent of the centres modified their clinical practice: 40.8% the diagnostic procedures, 80.9% the screening program, 50% cancelled curative and/or palliative treatments for LC, and 44.0% cancelled the liver transplantation program. Forty-five out 69 (65.2%) centres in which clinical trials were running modified their treatments in that setting, but 58.1% were able to recruit new patients. The phone call service was modified in 51.4% of centres which had this service prior to COVID-19 pandemic (n=19/37). CONCLUSION: The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic had a tremendous impact on the routine care of patients with LC. Modifications in screening, diagnostic and treatment algorithms may have significantly impaired the outcome of patients. Ongoing data collection and future analyses will report the benefits and disadvantages of the strategies implemented, aiding future decision making.","Muñoz-Martínez, Sergio; Sapena, Victor; Forner, Alejandro; Nault, Jean-Charles; Sapisochin, Gonzalo; Rimassa, Lorenza; Sangro, Bruno; Bruix, Jordi; Sanduzzi-Zamparelli, Marco; Holówko, Waclaw; El Kassas, Mohamed; Mocan, Tudor; Bouattour, Mohamed; Merle, Philippe; Hoogwater, Frederik J H; Alqahtani, Saleh A; Reeves, Helen L; Pinato, David J; Giorgakis, Emmanouil; Meyer, Tim; Villadsen, Gerda Elisabeth; Wege, Henning; Salati, Massimiliano; Mínguez, Beatriz; Di Costanzo, Giovan Giuseppe; Roderburg, Christoph; Tacke, Frank; Varela, María; Galle, Peter R; Alvares-da-Silva, Mario Reis; Trojan, Jörg; Bridgewater, John; Cabibbo, Giuseppe; Toso, Christian; Lachenmayer, Anja; Casadei-Gardini, Andrea; Toyoda, Hidenori; Lüdde, Tom; Villani, Rosanna; Matilla Peña, Ana María; Guedes Leal, Cassia Regina; Ronzoni, Monica; Delgado, Manuel; Perelló, Christie; Pascual, Sonia; Lledó, José Luis; Argemi, Josepmaria; Basu, Bristi; da Fonseca, Leonardo; Acevedo, Juan",JHEP Rep,47,1

A decade ago, we discovered that interferons also play an important role in the biology of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which are responsible for lifelong blood production. Though we have learned a great deal about the role of interferons on HSC quiescence, differentiation, and self-renewal, there remains some controversy regarding how interferons impact these stem cells, with differing conclusions depending on experimental models and clinical context. Here, we review the contradictory roles of Type 1 and 2 interferons in hematopoiesis. Specifically, we highlight the roles of interferons in embryonic and adult hematopoiesis, along with short-term and long-term adaptive and maladaptive responses to inflammation. We discuss experimental challenges in the study of these powerful yet short-lived cytokines and strategies to address those challenges. We further review the contribution by interferons to disease states including bone marrow failure and aplastic anemia as well as their therapeutic use to treat myeloproliferative neoplasms and viral infections, including SARS-CoV2. Understanding the opposing effects of interferons on hematopoiesis will elucidate immune responses and bone marrow failure syndromes, and future therapeutic approaches for patients undergoing HSC transplantation or fighting infectious diseases and cancer.","Demerdash, Yasmin; Kain, Bailee; Essers, Marieke A G; King, Katherine Y",Exp Hematol,47,2

Unfortunately, no successful vaccines or antiviral drugs are currently available which leaves the scientific community under huge pressure to tackle this pandemic. Among the identified promising druggable targets, specific to this virus, is the main protease (Mpro) enzyme, which is vital for viral replication, transcription and packaging within the host cells. In this study, selective inhibition of the Mpro was sought via thorough analysis of its available structural data in the Protein Data Bank. To this end, COVID-19 Mpro crystal complexes were explored and the key interacting residues (KIRs) within its active site, that are expected to be vital for effective ligand binding, were identified. Based on these KIRs, 3D pharmacophore models were generated and used in virtual screening of different databases. Retrieved hits were docked into the active site of the enzyme and their MM-PBSA based free binding energies were calculated. Finally, ADMET descriptors were calculated to aid the selection of top scoring hits with best ADMET properties. Nine compounds with different chemotypes were identified as potential Mpro inhibitors. Further, MD simulations of a virtual complex of Mpro with one of the promising hits revealed stable binding which is indicative of good inhibitory potential. The identified compounds in this study are expected to support the global drug discovery efforts in fighting against this highly contagious virus by narrowing the searchable chemical space for potential effective therapeutics.

To model the pedestrian dynamics we consider a kinetic equation for multi-group pedestrian flow based on a social force model coupled with an Eikonal equation. This model is coupled with a non-local SEIS contagion model for disease spread, where besides the description of local contacts also the influence of contact times has been modelled. Hydrodynamic approximations of the coupled system are derived. Finally, simulations of the hydrodynamic model are carried out using a mesh-free particle method.

Existing studies have examined this association across intervals ranging from days to years, leaving it unclear as to what extent differences in timing may explain differences across studies. In the present study, we used continuous time structural equation models (i.e., CT-SEM) to examine cross-lagged relations between the constructs, and also distinguished between-person differences from within-person processes (i.e., RI-CT-SEM). We analyzed 10 years of annual data from the Longitudinal Internet Studies of the Social Sciences (N = 14,741). When using CT-SEM, we found a bidirectional positive relation between self-esteem and satisfaction with social relationships, with larger effects over longer intervals. When using RI-CT-SEM, we found the largest effects of self-esteem and satisfaction with social relationships across intervals of 1 year, with smaller effect sizes at both shorter and longer intervals. In addition, the effect of fluctuations in people's satisfaction with social relationships on fluctuations in their self-esteem was greater than the reverse effect.

The follow-up was carried out by the daily data from the technical bulletins provided by the State of Pará Public Health Secretary (SESPA). On 18 March 2020, Pará notified the first case of COVID-19. After 7 weeks, the number of confirmed cases reached 4756 with 375 deaths.

The association between social isolation, quarantine and lockdown as an action to contain the infection was effective in reducing the region's new cases registration of COVID-19 in the short-term. However, short periods of lockdown may have promoted the virus spread among peripheral municipalities of the capital, as well as to inland regions.","Lélis da Silva, Félix; Dias Pita, Javier; Gomes, Maryjane Diniz A; Lélis da Silva, Andréa P; da Silva, Gabriel Lélis P",Epidemiol Infect,47,32

This study was aimed at determining asymptomatic spread of SARS-CoV-2 in a suburban, Southern U.S. population during a period of state restrictions and physical distancing mandates. This is one of the first published seroprevalence studies from North Carolina and included multicenter, primary care, and emergency care facilities serving a low-density, suburban and rural population since description of the North Carolina state index case introducing the SARS-CoV-2 respiratory pathogen to this population. To estimate point seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among asymptomatic individuals over time, two cohort studies were examined. The first cohort study, named ScreenNC, was comprised of outpatient clinics, and the second cohort study, named ScreenNC2, was comprised of inpatients unrelated to COVID-19. Asymptomatic infection by SARS-CoV-2 (with no clinical symptoms) was examined using an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)-approved antibody test (Abbott) for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG. This assay as performed under CLIA had a reported specificity/sensitivity of 100%/99.6%. ScreenNC identified 24 out of 2,973 (0.8%) positive individuals among asymptomatic participants accessing health care during 28 April to 19 June 2020, which was increasing over time. A separate cohort, ScreenNC2, sampled from 3 March to 4 June 2020, identified 10 out of 1,449 (0.7%) positive participants.IMPORTANCE This study suggests limited but accelerating asymptomatic spread of SARS-CoV-2. Asymptomatic infections, like symptomatic infections, disproportionately affected vulnerable communities in this population, and seroprevalence was higher in African American participants than in White participants. The low, overall prevalence may reflect the success of shelter-in-place mandates at the time this study was performed and of maintaining effective physical distancing practices among suburban populations. Under these public health measures and aggressive case finding, outbreak clusters did not spread into the general population.","Barzin, Amir; Schmitz, John L; Rosin, Samuel; Sirpal, Rameet; Almond, Martha; Robinette, Carole; Wells, Samantha; Hudgens, Michael; Olshan, Andrew; Deen, Stephanie; Krejci, Patrick; Quackenbush, Eugenia; Chronowski, Kevin; Cornaby, Caleb; Goins, Janette; Butler, Linda; Aucoin, Julia; Boyer, Kim; Faulk, Janet; Alston-Johnson, Devena; Page, Cristen; Zhou, Yijun; Fiscus, Lynne; Damania, Blossom; Dittmer, Dirk P; Peden, David B",mBio (Online),47,16

We reported clinical and viroimmunological data of all HIV-positive patients admitted to our center with COVID-19 from March 1 to May 12, 2020. Overall, five patients were included: all were virologically-suppressed on antiretroviral therapy and CD4+ count was greater than 350 cell/mm3 in all but two patients. Although all patients had evidence of pneumonia on admission, only one developed respiratory failure. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was never detected from nasopharyngeal swabs in two patients, whereas in the others, viral clearance occurred within a maximum of 43 days. Immunoglobulin G production was elicited in all patients and neutralizing antibodies in all but one patient. Specific-T-cell response developed in all patients but was stronger in those with the more severe presentations. Similarly, the highest level of proinflammatory cytokines was found in the only patient experiencing respiratory failure. Despite a mild presentation, patients with more pronounced immunosuppression showed high degrees of both cytokines production and immune activation. Our study did not find an increased risk and severity of COVID-19 in PLWH. Adaptative cellular immune response to SARS-CoV-2 appeared to correlate to disease severity. The mild clinical picture showed in advanced HIV patients, despite a significant T-cell activation and inflammatory profile, suggests a potential role of HIV-driven immunological dysregulation in avoiding immune-pathogenetic processes. However, other possible explanations, as a protective role of certain antiretroviral drugs, should be considered. Further larger studies are needed to better clarify the impact of HIV infection on COVID-19.","Mondi, Annalisa; Cimini, Eleonora; Colavita, Francesca; Cicalini, Stefania; Pinnetti, Carmela; Matusali, Giulia; Casetti, Rita; Maeurer, Markus; Vergori, Alessandra; Mazzotta, Valentina; Gagliardini, Roberta; De Zottis, Federico; Schininà, Vincenzo; Girardi, Enrico; Puro, Vincenzo; Ippolito, Giuseppe; Vaia, Francesco; Capobianchi, Maria Rosaria; Castilletti, Concetta; Agrati, Chiara; Antinori, Andrea",J. med. virol,47,33

METHODS: We enumerated SARS-CoV-2-specific interferon-Î³-producing CD69 CD4 and CD8 T-cells at months 4 and 6 from the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in 21 KT recipients by intracellular cytokine staining. Overlapping peptides encompassing the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein N-terminal 1- to 643-amino acid sequence and the membrane protein were used as stimulus. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies targeting the S1 protein were assessed by ELISA at month 6. RESULTS: Detectable (&#8805;0.1%) SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T-cell response was found in 57.1% and 47.4% of patients at months 4 and 6. Corresponding rates for CD8 T-cells were 19.0% and 42.1%, respectively. Absolute SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell counts increased from month 4 to month 6 in CD8 (P-value = 0.086) but not CD4 subsets (P-value = 0.349). Four out of 10 patients with any detectable response at month 4 had lost SARS-CoV-2-CMI by month 6, whereas 5 out of 9 patients mounted SARS-CoV-2-CMI within this period. All but two patients (89.5%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Patients lacking detectable SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 response by month 6 were more likely to be under tacrolimus (100.0% versus 66.7%; P-value = 0.087) and to have received tocilizumab for the previous COVID-19 episode (40.0% versus 0.0%; P-value = 0.087).

Commonly used phylogenetic trees based on alignments can be used to visualize only a limited number of protein sequences. DGraph, introduced here, is an application developed to generate 2-dimensional (2D) maps based on similarity scores for sequences. The program automatically calculates and graphically displays property distance (PD) scores based on physico-chemical property (PCP) similarities from an unaligned list of FASTA files. Such ""PD-graphs"" show the interrelatedness of the sequences, whereby clusters can reveal deeper connectivities. Results: Property distance graphs generated for flavivirus (FV), enterovirus (EV), and coronavirus (CoV) sequences from complete polyproteins or individual proteins are consistent with biological data on vector types, hosts, cellular receptors, and disease phenotypes. Property distance graphs separate the tick- from the mosquito-borne FV, cluster viruses that infect bats, camels, seabirds, and humans separately. The clusters correlate with disease phenotype. The PD method segregates the β-CoV spike proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) sequences from other human pathogenic CoV, with clustering consistent with cellular receptor usage. The graphs also suggest evolutionary relationships that may be difficult to determine with conventional bootstrapping methods that require postulating an ancestral sequence.

Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the interleukin-6 receptor, is being administered off-label to some patients with COVID-19, and although early small studies suggested a benefit, there are no conclusive data proving its usefulness. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 with or without treatment with Tocilizumab. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective study of 1938 patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to hospitals within the Jefferson Health system in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, between March 25, 2020 and June 17, 2020, of which 307 received Tocilizumab. EXPOSURES: Confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcomes data related to length of stay, admission to intensive care unit (ICU), requirement of mechanical ventilation, and mortality were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: The average age was 65.2, with 47% women; 36.4% were African-American. The average length of stay was 22 days with 26.3% of patients requiring admission to the ICU and 14.9% requiring mechanical ventilation. The overall mortality was 15.3%. Older age, admission to an ICU, and requirement for mechanical ventilation were associated with higher mortality. Treatment with Tocilizumab was also associated with higher mortality, which was mainly observed in subjects not requiring care in an ICU with estimated odds ratio (OR) of 2.9 (p = 0.0004). Tocilizumab treatment was also associated with higher likelihood of admission to an ICU (OR = 4.8, p < 0.0001), progression to requiring mechanical ventilation (OR = 6.6, p < 0.0001), and increased length of stay (OR = 16.2, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Our retrospective analysis revealed an association between Tocilizumab administration and increased mortality, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and length of stay in subjects with COVID-19. Prospective trials are needed to evaluate the true effect of Tocilizumab in this condition.","Li, Michael; Yoo, Erika J; Baram, Michael; McArthur, Melanie; Skeehan, Connor; Awsare, Bharat; George, Gautam; Summer, Ross; Zurlo, John; Jallo, Jack; Roman, Jesse",Am J Med Sci,47,16

This study aims to demonstrate that a combined framework based on telematics and in-person clinical encounter not only ensures medical care but the safety of healthcare professionals and patients. Material and method: Descriptive observational study on the follow-up of patients during the COVID19 Pandemic, combining telephone and traditional. Results: A total of 5031 telephone calls were made, differentiating between medical referrals, specialised primary care visits, and outpatient consultation.They were classified as successful, required an in-person visit, or no successful telephone contact. Furthermore, we divided them into 2 groups: resolved and unresolved.53% of all telematic visits were successful. Conclusions: Telematic medical systems are a feasible option in a orthopedics department and an interesting resource to preserve once the pandemic is resolved.

Newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 (SARS-CoV-2) recognizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to gain entry into different cells. Interestingly, besides SARS-CoV2, four other human coronaviruses (HCoVs) use three different ectopeptidases (ACE2, dipeptidyl peptidase 4, and aminopeptidase N) as receptors independent of their common peptidase activity. This issue has led to the important question ""why do several HCoVs rely on peptidases as their receptors?."" In this paper, we discussed to answer this question. Mostly, it seems that the use of peptidases by HCoVs may be more related to their widespread presence on target cells and also viruses prefer to take advantage of molecules with relatively low affinity for their natural ligands through evolving a stronger binding affinity to the surface receptors for entry and endocytosis. Meanwhile evolutionary conservation of these receptors may allow HCoVs to switch between different host species. Finally, the choice of peptidases by HCoVs may reflect the ""trial and error"" nature of evolution. In conclusion, substantial efforts are needed to get a strong picture of this fascinating question and poorly explored area. Detailed understanding of the entry mechanisms offers opportunities for the development of refined strategies to stop viruses.","Shatizadeh Malekshahi, Somayeh; Yavarian, Jila; Shafiei-Jandaghi, Nazanin-Zahra",Biotechnol. appl. biochem,47,25

In this study, we investigated the possible effect of several local socio-economic factors on the case count and time course of confirmed Covid-19 cases and Covid-19-related deaths across the twenty one counties of New Jersey. Socio-economic and geographic factors considered included population, percentage of elders in the population, percentage of low-income households, access to food and health facilities and distance to New York. We found that the counties could be clustered into three groups based on (a) the case totals, (b) the total number of deaths, (c) the time course of the cases and (d) the time course of the deaths. The four groupings were very similar to one another and could all be largely explained by the county population, the percentage of low-income population, and the distance of the county from New York. As for food and health factors, the numbers of local restaurants and pharmacies significantly influenced the total number of cases and deaths as well as the epidemic's evolution. In particular, the number of cases and deaths showed a decrease with the number of McDonald's within the county in contrast to other fast-food or non-fast food restaurants. Overall, our study found that the evolution of the epidemic was influenced by certain socio-economic factors, which could be helpful for the formulation of public health policies.","Amaratunga, Dhammika; Cabrera, Javier; Ghosh, Debopriya; Katehakis, Michael N; Wang, Jin; Wang, Wenting",Ann Oper Res,47,15

Using GS/BS patients as nature's experiments, we found them to be a human model of endogenous Ang II antagonism with activated Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS), resulting in high Ang II levels with blunted cardiovascular effects. These patients are also characterized by increased and directly correlated levels of both Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and Ang 1-7. Understanding the myriad of distinctive and frequently overlapping clinical presentations of GS/BS arises remains challenging. Efforts to find a treatment for COVID-19 has fueled a recent surge in interest in chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and its effects. Of specific interest are chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine's ability to inhibit SARS-CoV infection by impairing ACE2, the SARS-CoV2 entry point, through terminal glycosylation via effects on TGN/post-Golgi pH homeostasis. Several different studies with a GS or a BS phenotype, along with a nonsyndromic form of X-linked intellectual disability linked to a mutated SLC9A7, provide additional evidence that specific gene defects can act via misregulation of TGN/post-Golgi pH homeostasis, which leads to a common mechanistic basis resulting in overlapping phenotypes. We suggest that linkage between the specific gene defects identified in GS and BS and the myriad of distinctive and frequently overlapping clinical findings may be the result of aberrant glycosylation of ACE2 driven by altered TGN/endosome system acidification caused by the metabolic alkalosis brought about by these salt-losing tubulopathies in addition to their altered intracellular calcium signaling due to a blunted second messenger induced intracellular calcium release that is, in turn, amplified by the RAS system.","Calò, Lorenzo A; Davis, Paul A",Int. j. mol. sci.

PURPOSE: Highly effective coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines have brought hope for ending the pandemic. Unprecedented mass vaccination started first among healthcare workers. The aim of this report is to describe key strategies undertaken by a large hospital pharmacy department to meet the challenges of preparing a large quantity of COVID-19 vaccine doses in a short period of time. SUMMARY: MedStar Washington Hospital Center (MWHC) was in the first group of hospitals in Washington, DC, to receive Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in December 2020. The pharmacy department faced challenges including stringent vaccine storage requirements, a need for specific equipment and workflow, limited funding, and staffing constraints. The pharmacy department's senior leaders defined pharmacy responsibilities, budgeted for equipment, participated in vaccination center design, and instructed pharmacy informatics personnel. The vaccine coordinators were appointed to oversee all vaccination-related operations. An ultra-low temperature freezer was installed 2 weeks before arrival of the first shipment of vaccine. All pharmacy order entry tools and operating procedures were standardized, and staff training and schedules were finalized by December 15. The first dose of the vaccine was administered on December 16 at the vaccination center. Pharmacy staff members dispensed the vaccine doses and monitored patients. By January 6, 2021, MWHC had vaccinated 3,812 employees with their first vaccine dose, with an average of 228 doses administered daily. CONCLUSION: Key strategies such as systemic coordination, early preparation, detailed planning, operating procedure development, and staff education and engagement proved successful in facilitating preparation of thousands of COVID-19 vaccine doses for hospital employees within a short period of time.","Li, Quan; Norman, Sarah; Guthrie, Pauline; Gachoya, Julianna; Sebakijje, Justin; Leftridge, Zetta; Willis, Cynthia G; Kishore, Anil; Breakenridge, Margaret; Spence, Clyde",Am. j. health system pharm,47,16

This polyprotein usually contains at least one protease whose primary function is to process the polyprotein into mature proteins. Such proteases also may have other functions in the replication cycle. For instance, cysteine proteases (PRO) frequently double up as ubiquitin hydrolases (DUB), thus interfering with cellular processes critical for virus replication. We previously reported the crystal structures of such a PRO/DUB from Turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV) and of its complex with one of its PRO substrates. Here we report the crystal structure of TYMV PRO/DUB in complex with ubiquitin. We find that PRO/DUB recognizes ubiquitin in an unorthodox way: It interacts with the body of ubiquitin through a split recognition motif engaging both the major and the secondary recognition patches of ubiquitin (Ile44 patch and Ile36 patch, respectively, including Leu8 which is part of the two patches). However, the contacts are suboptimal on both sides. Introducing a single point mutation in TYMV PRO/DUB aimed at improving Ub-binding led to a much more active DUB. Comparison with other PRO/DUBs from other viral families, particularly coronaviruses, suggests that low DUB activities of viral PRO/DUBs may generally be fine-tuned features of interaction with host factors.","Fieulaine, Sonia; Witte, Martin D; Theile, Christopher S; Ayach, Maya; Ploegh, Hidde L; Jupin, Isabelle; Bressanelli, Stéphane",J. biol. chem,47,16

If a coal mining enterprise loses its SLO, it may face risks in operations, which may lead to value chain risks. One of the causes of enterprise failure as related to coal mining operations is the inability to reliably assess/manage risk holistically and the inability to understand that lack of SLO is a critical risk. Although financial risks are typically assessed for mining projects, lack of SLO risk should also be taken into account starting as early as the bankable feasibility study. Furthermore, as it is difficult to establish a proactive decision-making policy for SLO risk in coal mining operations, the Operational Risk Management (ORM) methodology is probably a good tool to apply towards that goal. For this reason, a Mining Operational Risk Management Model (MORMM) was developed to incorporate risk probabilities and risk severities evaluated by experts. The final risk assessment is coded using Risk Assessment Codes (RACs). A hypothetical scenario was developed utilizing the MORMM model in order to illustrate how risks can be managed during the SLO granting process. This scenario describes a hypothetical coal mining project evaluated by virtual risk evaluators under specific hazard categories. Risk evaluation involves the assessment of risk probability and risk severity. Through this scenario this paper presents ways: (i) to establish a baseline ORM process that will be applicable to any coal mining operation environment, and (ii) to provide a theoretical example to demonstrate how the method can be applied to coal mining operations. The resulting RACs can provide critical information to decision makers regarding the rejection, acceptance or re-engineering of the mining business plan.","Kamenopoulos, S; Agioutantis, Z",,47,16

New diseases emerge annually and place enormous burdens on many countries. Additionally, using humans to handle pandemic situations increases the chances of disease spreading. Therefore, various technologies that do not directly involve humans should be employed to handle pandemic situations. The Internet of Drones (IoDT), artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain are emerging technologies that have revolutionized the modern world. This article presents a blockchain-based AI-empowered pandemic situation supervision scheme in which a swarm of drones embedded with AI is engaged to autonomously monitor pandemic outbreaks, thereby keeping human involvement as low as possible. A use case based on a recent pandemic (i.e., COVID-19) is discussed. Two types of drone swarms are used to handle multiple tasks (e.g., checking face masks and imposing lockdowns). A lightweight blockchain is considered to handle situations in remote areas with poor network connectivity. Additionally, a two-phase lightweight security mechanism is adopted to validate the entities in the proposed scheme. A proof of concept is established using an experimental environment setup and dataset training. An analysis of the experimental results demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed scheme.

Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted using EMBASE, PubMed/Medline, and Google Scholar from January 2020 to 7 January 2021 to identify all studies describing clinical profile, outcome and mortality rates regarding DKA, HHS, DKA/HHS and EDKA cases in COVID-19 patients. The appropriate Joanna Briggs Institute tools were used for quality assessment; quality of evidence was approached using GRADE. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess correlations between clinical characteristics and outcome based on case reports. Combined mortality rates (CMR) were estimated from data reported in case report series, cross-sectional studies, and meta-analyses. The protocol was submitted to PROSPERO (ID: 229356/230737). Results: From 312 identified publications, 44 were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed. Critical COVID-19 necessitating ICU (P = 3 × 10-8), DKA/HHS presence (P = 0.021), and AKI (P = 0.037) were independently correlated with death. Increased COVID-19 severity (P = 0.003), elevated lactates (P < 0.001), augmented anion gap (P < 0.001), and AKI (P = 0.002) were associated with DKA/HHS. SGLT-2i were linked with EDKA (P = 0.004) and negatively associated with AKI (P = 0.023). CMR was 27.1% (95% CI 11.2-46.9%) with considerable heterogeneity (I 2 = 67%). Conclusion: Acute diabetes-related metabolic emergencies in COVID-19 patients lead to increased mortality; key determinants are critical COVID-19 illness, coexistence of DKA/HHS and AKI. Previous SGLT-2i treatment, though associated with EDKA, might preserve renal function in COVID-19 patients.

This virus produces the syndrome of acute respiratory stress that h as been witnessed in other coronaviruses, such as that MERS-CoV in Middle East countries or SARS-CoV which was seen in 2002 and 2003 in China. This virus mediates its entry through its spike (S) proteins interacting with ACE2 receptors in lung epithelial cells, and may promote an inflammatory response by means of inflammasome NLRP3 activation and unfolded protein response (these are possibly consequence of the envelope E protein of COVID-19 virus).

Maternal COVID-19 antibody was detected 2 weeks after positive molecular testing. Antibodies were never detected on cord blood samples from two intrauterine fetal cord blood samples as well as neonatal cord blood at the time of delivery. CONCLUSION: This case demonstrates a lack of passive immunity of COVID-19 antibodies from a positive pregnant woman to her fetus, neither in utero nor at the time of birth. Further studies are needed to understand if passage of antibodies can occur and if that can confer passive immunity in the newborn.

In particular, the focus is to highlight those papers which are using either machine learning or deep learning approaches. Student feedback assessment is a hot topic which has attracted a lot of attention in recent times. The importance has increased manyfold due to the recent pandemic outbreak which pushed many colleges and universities to shift teaching from on-campus physical classes to online via eLearning platforms and tools including massive open online courses (MOOCs). Assessing student feedback is even more important now. This short survey paper, therefore, highlights recent trends in the natural language processing domain on the topic of automatic student feedback assessment. It presents techniques commonly utilized in this domain and discusses some future research directions.","Edalati, Maryam",,47,24

A series of policy shifts by various governmental bodies have been speculated to have contributed to the polarization of face masks. A typical method to investigate the effects of these policy shifts is to use surveys. However, survey-based approaches have multiple limitations: biased responses, limited sample size, badly crafted questions may skew responses and inhibit insight, and responses may prove quickly irrelevant as opinions change in response to a dynamic topic. We propose a novel approach to 1) accurately gauge public sentiment towards face masks in the United States during COVID-19 using a multi-modal demographic inference framework with topic modeling and 2) determine whether face mask policy shifts contributed to polarization towards face masks using offline change point analysis on Twitter data. First, we infer several key demographics of individual Twitter users such as their age, gender, and whether they are a college student using a multi-modal demographic prediction framework and analyze the average sentiment for each respective demographic. Next, we conduct topic analysis using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). Finally, we conduct offline change point discovery on our sentiment time series data using the Pruned Exact Linear Time (PELT) search algorithm. Experimental results on a large corpus of Twitter data reveal multiple insights regarding demographic sentiment towards face masks that agree with existing surveys. Furthermore, we find two key policy-shift events contributed to statistically significant changes in sentiment for both Republicans and Democrats.","Yeung, Neil; Lai, Jonathan; Luo, Jiebo",,47,4

The perspective of end users on the characteristics and clinical use of these assays has not been previously considered. Methods: We surveyed 17,186 health care professions (HCPs) in 29 countries to gauge opinion on the design, use, diagnostic impact and diagnostic accuracy of COVID-19 tests. Results were correlated with national statistics on the burden of disease and testing in individual countries. Results: HCPs overwhelmingly recognized the importance of COVID-19 tests but 37.1% were unsure of the appropriate timing of investigations relative to disease symptoms. Confidence in the diagnostic accuracy of assays varied inversely with COVID-19-related mortality in individual countries but had no relationship with the total number of tests performed. There was global consensus that the most important impact of positive antigen and antibody testing was confidence in returning to work following recovery. Saliva was the preferred sampling fluid for COVID-19 diagnostic tests in all groups surveyed. Conclusions: HCP input can ensure novel assays are fit for purpose in varied global health care settings, but HCPs may require support to effectively use novel diagnostics thus minimizing waste when supplies are limited.","Shields, Adrian M; Brown, Hannah; Phillips, Neil; Drayson, Mark T; Richter, Anton A; Richter, Alex G",Front Public Health,47,21

MATERIALS AND METHODS: All neurological departments with a Stroke Unit in Norway (n = 17) were invited to participate in a questionnaire survey. The study focused on the first lockdown period, and all questions were thus answered in regard to the period between 12 March and 15 April 2020. RESULTS: The responder rate was 94% (16/17). Eighty-one % (13/16) reported that the pandemic affected their department, and 63% (10/16) changed their stroke care pathways. The number of new acute admissions in terms of both strokes and stroke mimics decreased at all 16 departments. Fewer patients received thrombolysis and endovascular treatment, and multidisciplinary stroke rehabilitation services were less available. The mandatory 3 months of follow-up of stroke patients was postponed at 73% of the hospitals. All departments conducting stroke research reported a stop in ongoing projects. CONCLUSION: In Norway, hospital-based stroke care and research were impacted during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, with likely repercussions for patient care and outcomes. In the future, stroke departments will require contingency plans in order to protect the entire stroke treatment chain.","Kristoffersen, Espen Saxhaug; Jahr, Silje Holt; Faiz, Kashif Waqar; Storstein, Anette Margrethe; Winsvold, Bendik Slagsvold; Sandset, Else Charlotte",Acta neurol. scand,47,16

How accurate were the predictions of 'experts'-individuals holding occupations or roles in subject-relevant fields, such as epidemiologists and statisticians-compared with those of the public? We conducted a survey in April 2020 of 140 UK experts and 2,086 UK laypersons; all were asked to make four quantitative predictions about the impact of COVID-19 by 31 Dec 2020. In addition to soliciting point estimates, we asked participants for lower and higher bounds of a range that they felt had a 75% chance of containing the true answer. Experts exhibited greater accuracy and calibration than laypersons, even when restricting the comparison to a subset of laypersons who scored in the top quartile on a numeracy test. Even so, experts substantially underestimated the ultimate extent of the pandemic, and the mean number of predictions for which the expert intervals contained the actual outcome was only 1.8 (out of 4), suggesting that experts should consider broadening the range of scenarios they consider plausible. Predictions of the public were even more inaccurate and poorly calibrated, suggesting that an important role remains for expert predictions as long as experts acknowledge their uncertainty.","Recchia, Gabriel; Freeman, Alexandra L J; Spiegelhalter, David",PLoS One,47,20

Our indicator is based on the chronology of stage-by-stage progress of individual vaccines and related news. We construct a general equilibrium regime-switching model of repeated pandemics and stages of vaccine progress wherein the representative agent withdraws labor and alters consumption endogenously to mitigate health risk. The value of a cure in the resulting asset-pricing framework is intimately linked to the relative labor supply across states. The observed stock market response to vaccine progress serves to identify this quantity, allowing us to use the model to estimate the economywide welfare gain that would be attributable to a cure. In our estimation, and with standard preference parameters, the value of the ability to end the pandemic is worth 5-15% of total wealth. This value rises substantially when there is uncertainty about the frequency and duration of pandemics. Agents place almost as much value on the ability to resolve the uncertainty as they do on the value of the cure itself. This effect is stronger - not weaker - when agents have a preference for later resolution of uncertainty. The policy implication is that understanding the fundamental biological and social determinants of future pandemics may be as important as resolving the immediate crisis.","Acharya, V.

Despite the development of effective vaccines, rollout has been slow. We evaluated the impact of accelerated vaccine distribution on curbing the disease burden of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants. Methods We used an agent-based model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and vaccination to simulate the spread of novel variants with S-Gene Target Failure (SGTF) in addition to the original strain. We incorporated age-specific risk and contact patterns and implemented a two-dose vaccination campaign in accord with CDC-recommended prioritization. As a base case, we projected hospitalizations and deaths at a daily vaccination rate of 1 million doses in the United States (US) and compared with accelerated campaigns in which daily doses were expanded to 1.5, 2, 2.5, or 3 million. Findings We found that at a vaccination rate of 1 million doses per day, an emergent SGTF variant that is 20–70% more transmissible than the original variant would become dominant within 2 to 9 weeks, accounting for as much as 99% of cases at the outbreak peak. Our results show that accelerating vaccine delivery would substantially reduce severe health outcomes. For a SGTF with 30% higher transmissibility, increasing vaccine doses from 1 to 3 million per day would avert 152,048 (95% CrI: 134,772–168,696) hospitalizations and 48,448 (95% CrI: 42,042–54,285) deaths over 300 days. Accelerated vaccination would also prevent additional COVID-19 waves that would otherwise be fuelled by waning adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). Interpretation We found that the current pace of vaccine rollout is insufficient to prevent the exacerbation of the pandemic that will be attributable to the novel, more contagious SARS-CoV-2 variants. Accelerating the vaccination rate should be a public health priority for averting the expected surge in COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths that would be associated with widespread dissemination of the SGTF variants. Our results underscore the need to bolster the production and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, to rapidly expand vaccination priority groups and distribution sites.","Sah, Pratha Vilches Thomas N.; Moghadas, Seyed M.; Fitzpatrick, Meagan C.; Singer, Burton H.; Hotez, Peter J.; Galvani, Alison P.",EClinicalMedicine,47,21

We produce molecumentaries, i.e., molecular documentaries featuring structural models from molecular biology. We employ scalable methods instead of the rigid traditional production pipeline. Our method is motivated by the rapid evolution of interactive scientific visualization, which shows great potential in science dissemination. Without some form of explanation or guidance, however, novices and lay-persons often find it difficult to gain insights from the visualization itself. We integrate such knowledge using the verbal channel and provide it along an engaging visual presentation. To realize the synthesis of a molecumentary, we provide technical solutions along two major production steps: 1) preparing a story structure and 2) turning the story into a concrete narrative. In the first step, information about the model from heterogeneous sources is compiled into a story graph. Local knowledge is combined with remote sources to complete the story graph and enrich the final result. In the second step, a narrative, i.e., story elements presented in sequence, is synthesized using the story graph. We present a method for traversing the story graph and generating a virtual tour, using automated camera and visualization transitions. Texts written by domain experts are turned into verbal representations using text-to-speech functionality and provided as a commentary. Using the described framework we synthesize automatic fly-throughs with descriptions that mimic a manually authored documentary.

It is associated with a high mortality rate and has created a global crisis by straining medical resources worldwide. OBJECTIVES: To develop and validate machine-learning models for prediction of mechanical ventilation (MV) for patients presenting to emergency room and for prediction of in-hospital mortality once a patient is admitted. METHODS: Two cohorts were used for the two different aims. 1980 COVID-19 patients were enrolled for the aim of prediction ofMV. 1036 patients' data, including demographics, past smoking and drinking history, past medical history and vital signs at emergency room (ER), laboratory values, and treatments were collected for training and 674 patients were enrolled for validation using XGBoost algorithm. For the second aim to predict in-hospital mortality, 3491 hospitalized patients via ER were enrolled. CatBoost, a new gradient-boosting algorithm was applied for training and validation of the cohort. RESULTS: Older age, higher temperature, increased respiratory rate (RR) and a lower oxygen saturation (SpO2) from the first set of vital signs were associated with an increased risk of MV amongst the 1980 patients in the ER. The model had a high accuracy of 86.2% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 87.8%. While, patients who required MV, had a higher RR, Body mass index (BMI) and longer length of stay in the hospital were the major features associated with in-hospital mortality. The second model had a high accuracy of 80% with NPV of 81.6%. CONCLUSION: Machine learning models using XGBoost and catBoost algorithms can predict need for mechanical ventilation and mortality with a very high accuracy in COVID-19 patients.","Yu, Limin; Halalau, Alexandra; Dalal, Bhavinkumar; Abbas, Amr E; Ivascu, Felicia; Amin, Mitual; Nair, Girish B",PLoS One,47,16

A key unknown in simulating secondary breakup in turbulent multiphase jets is the inflow size distribution generated within the primary breakup zone near the nozzle exit. A mono-disperse injection inflow condition is commonly used for simplicity, but this choice is often unrealistic. In order to provide more realistic inlet conditions for LES, we develop a one dimensional (1D) parcel model to predict the evolution of the dispersed phase along the jet centerline due to the combined effects of advection, radial turbulent transport and droplet breakup due to turbulence in the regions closer to the jet nozzle that cannot be resolved using coarse LES. The model is validated with experimental data measured far from the nozzle. The 1D model is also used to generate an initial size distribution for use in a coarse-resolution LES of a turbulent jet. Number density fields for each bin of the discretized droplet size distribution are modeled using an Eulerian LES approach and scalar transport equations are solved for each bin. LES results are compared to published experimental data, with good agreement and we examine the statistics of the velocity field and the concentration of the polydisperse oil droplet plumes for two droplet Weber numbers. We find that the centerline decay rate of the concentration for different droplet sizes is modified in the breakup dominated zone. Unlike Reynolds averaged approaches, LES also allows us to quantify size distribution variability due to turbulence. We quantify the radial and axial distributions and the variability of key quantities such as the Sauter mean diameter, total surface area and droplet breakup time-scale and explore their sensitivity to the Weber number.","Aiyer, Aditya; Meneveau, Charles",,47,16

STUDY DESIGN: Anonymous online questionnaire survey. SAMPLE POPULATION: Eighty-one eligible responses were collected in September 2020, including 52 European College of Veterinary Surgeons (ECVS) residents and 29 ECVS Diplomates acting as supervisors. METHODS: Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data. Fisher's exact test was used to test for significance. RESULTS: A reduction in surgical case load was reported by 82% (n = 66/81) of respondents, with 82% (n = 54/66) of those believing that COVID-19 had a mild-to-moderate impact on training. Compared to supervisors, residents were less likely to feel that appropriate guidance, a safe working environment, and measures to preserve training had been provided (p < .01). Only 45% (n = 22/49) of residents reported confidence with performing teleconsultations. Ninety percent (n = 73/81) of respondents considered online ""case presentations"" and ""edited surgical video footage"" as a positive ancillary tool. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has resulted in a reduction in case load and training for the majority of residents. A discrepancy between the opinions of residents and supervisors was noted on various aspects of COVID-19 related effects. IMPACT: Open communication, as well as the use of additional training tools through digital platforms may help to preserve safe and effective training during times of decreased clinical activity. While this study has focused on surgical specialist training, the results could be applied to other disciplines.","Alexander, Akash; Radke, Heidi",Vet Surg,47,26

In this study, patients with inflammatory rheumatic disease were asked in the first weeks of the pandemic on their opinion of their immunomodulating therapy. The result shows that over 90% of the patients followed the recommendation of the rheumatologist to continue the antirheumatic therapy, and only a small percentage of the patients terminated the therapy on their own.

However, low patient compliance and low drug levels compromise its effectiveness. Our group developed a ketorolac-loaded ocular coil for sustained drug delivery up to 28 days. The aim of this study was to gain insight into the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of the ocular coil. The pharmacokinetics of the ketorolac-loaded ocular coil versus eye drops were tested in New Zealand White rabbits by repetitive sampling for 28 days. Efficacy of the ocular coil was also tested in New Zealand White rabbits. Ocular inflammation was induced where after the ocular coil was inserted, or eye drops, or no treatment was provided. The total protein concentration and cytokine levels were measured in tears, aqueous humor, and plasma at 4 h, 8 h, 24 h, 4 d, 7 d, 14 d, 21 d, and 28 d. Four h after inserting the ocular coil in the eye, ketorolac levels in aqueous humor and plasma were higher in the ocular coil group than in the eye drop group. Ketorolac released from the ocular coil could be detected up to 28 d in tears, up to 4 d in aqueous humor and up to 24 h in plasma. After inducing inflammation, both the ocular coil and eye drops were able to suppress prostaglandin E2, TNF&#945; and IL-6 levels in aqueous humor and plasma as compared to the group that received no treatment. To conclude, the ocular coil facilitated a sustained release of the drug and showed similar therapeutic benefit in suppressing post-operative inflammation as eye drops.","Bertens, Christian J F; Gijs, Marlies; Dias, Aylvin A J; van den Biggelaar, Frank J H M; Ghosh, Arkasubhra; Sethu, Swaminathan; Nuijts, Rudy M M A",Drug Deliv,47,2

In addition to the treatment of COVID-19 patients, universities and other acute care hospitals had to provide emergency medical care, including for patients undergoing trauma surgery. The challenge was that no reliable planning figures were available regarding the expected volume for such a crisis situation and therefore no reliable resource planning was possible in this respect. Therefore, the aim of this work was to record the incidence of polytrauma and other injuries during the pandemic crisis in a university trauma surgery clinic and to compare it with the years 2017-2019. METHODS: In this single-center study, a retrospective analysis of the injury incidence during calendar weeks with existing exit restrictions (12th-19th week) for the year 2020 for trauma surgery patients of a university hospital was performed. At first, the treatment of COVID-19 patients was recorded daily in order to objectify the burden and expenditure of inpatient treatment for these patients. Then, for the evaluation period from 20.03.2020 to 06.05.2020, the numbers of 1. polytrauma, 2. work-related accidents and 3. leisure-related trauma patients were recorded and compared with the numbers from 2017-2019 during the same period. RESULTS: In total, 118 patients were treated with COVID-19 as inpatients during the period under study, of which up to 43 patients had to be treated simultaneously in intensive care on 1 day. Overall, the number of polytrauma, work-related accidents and leisure-time accident patients was lower in 2020 than in the previous years. Nevertheless, with a decline of only -28% (22â¯± 4.9 vs. 16), a considerable number of polytrauma patients were recorded, while all work-related accidents (44%, 304â¯± 31.3 vs. 170) and also leisure-time accidents (39%, 173â¯± 22.7 vs. 106) considerably decreased. In the group of leisure-time accidents, there was initially a remarkable decline in the number of cases per week after the initial restrictions began, but as the duration of the restrictions increased, the number per week has risen to the level of previous years. DISCUSSION: Even in exceptional situations such as the corona pandemic, there were a significant number of patients in need of acute treatment, especially polytrauma patients. This should be considered in the future in the event of similar exceptional situations in the inpatient care framework when providing trauma surgery care capacities.","Popp, Daniel; Worlicek, Michael; Koch, Matthias; Kerschbaum, Maximilian; Rupp, Markus; Schicho, Andreas; Künzig, Holger; Zimmermann, Markus; Pfeifer, Christian; Alt, Volker",Unfallchirurg,47,13

All patients diagnosed with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in 2015-2018 in six Dutch large teaching hospitals (Santeon network) were identified and followed-up from date of diagnosis until death or end of data collection. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) from first-line (1L) pembrolizumab and second-line (2L) nivolumab were compared with clinical trial data by calculating hazard ratios (HRs). From 1950 diagnosed patients, 1005 (52%) started with any 1L treatment, of which 83 received pembrolizumab. Nivolumab was started as 2L treatment in 141 patients. For both settings, PFS times were comparable between real-world and trials (HR 1.08 (95% CI 0.75-1.55), and HR 0.91 (95% CI 0.74-1.14), respectively). OS was significantly shorter in real-world for 1L pembrolizumab (HR 1.55; 95% CI 1.07-2.25). Receiving subsequent lines of treatment was less frequent in real-world compared to trials. There is no EE gap for PFS from immunotherapy in patients with stage IV NSCLC. However, there is a gap in OS for 1L pembrolizumab. Fewer patients proceeding to a subsequent line of treatment in real-world could partly explain this.","Cramer-van der Welle, Christine M; Verschueren, Marjon V; Tonn, Merel; Peters, Bas J M; Schramel, Franz M N H; Klungel, Olaf H; Groen, Harry J M; van de Garde, Ewoudt M W",Sci Rep,47,16

This experimental study was done to validate and compare the protection offered by the conventional breath shields and the one described by us in a simulated environment. Methods: In this experimental study, 12 puffs of fine mist were sprayed over a period of 1 minute using ""magenta-colored dye"" and ""cyan-colored dye"" for analyzing proximal barrier and distal barrier respectively. To access the amount of contamination of the slit lamp, caused by sprayed ""magenta"" and ""cyan"" colored dye, we covered the entire slit lamp with appropriately sized white-colored cotton sheet. The stained sheets were individually photographed and then the images were first cropped, then color threshold adjusted and then converted to binary and finally fraction of surface area stained was calculated using the ImageJ software. (Pn Surface Area magenta fraction (%) during analysis of ""proximal barrier"" and Pn Surface Area cyan fraction (%) during the analysis of ""distal barrier"", where Pn refers to various parts of slit lamp. Results: The entire surface area of the cloth covering the slit lamp was 9912.45 cm2. The surface area of the cloth which was stained when using the ""proximal barrier"" was 567.50 cm2 whereas when using the ""distal barrier"" was 222.93 cm2. When using proximal barrier, 97.71% of the staining was present on the slit lamp base, viewing arm, illumination arm and the pivot of the slit lamp. While using the distal breath shield no parts of the viewing arm, illumination arm, the pivot or the mechanical base with joystick were stained. Conclusion: The novel PVC AC curtain shield provides better barrier against the simulated contaminated stream of patient's breath directed towards the working parts of the slit lamp as compared to conventional slit lamp oculars mounted breath shields.","Mannan, Rashim; Pruthi, Archna; Sud, Rouli; Khanduja, Sumeet",Indian J Ophthalmol,47,1

We aimed to assess the effectiveness of azithromycin to treat suspected COVID-19 among people in the community who had an increased risk of complications. METHODS: In this UK-based, primary care, open-label, multi-arm, adaptive platform randomised trial of interventions against COVID-19 in people at increased risk of an adverse clinical course (PRINCIPLE), we randomly assigned people aged 65 years and older, or 50 years and older with at least one comorbidity, who had been unwell for 14 days or less with suspected COVID-19, to usual care plus azithromycin 500 mg daily for three days, usual care plus other interventions, or usual care alone. The trial had two coprimary endpoints measured within 28 days from randomisation: time to first self-reported recovery, analysed using a Bayesian piecewise exponential, and hospital admission or death related to COVID-19, analysed using a Bayesian logistic regression model. Eligible participants with outcome data were included in the primary analysis, and those who received the allocated treatment were included in the safety analysis. The trial is registered with ISRCTN, ISRCTN86534580. FINDINGS: The first participant was recruited to PRINCIPLE on April 2, 2020. The azithromycin group enrolled participants between May 22 and Nov 30, 2020, by which time 2265 participants had been randomly assigned, 540 to azithromycin plus usual care, 875 to usual care alone, and 850 to other interventions. 2120 (94%) of 2265 participants provided follow-up data and were included in the Bayesian primary analysis, 500 participants in the azithromycin plus usual care group, 823 in the usual care alone group, and 797 in other intervention groups. 402 (80%) of 500 participants in the azithromycin plus usual care group and 631 (77%) of 823 participants in the usual care alone group reported feeling recovered within 28 days. We found little evidence of a meaningful benefit in the azithromycin plus usual care group in time to first reported recovery versus usual care alone (hazard ratio 1·08, 95% Bayesian credibility interval [BCI] 0·95 to 1·23), equating to an estimated benefit in median time to first recovery of 0·94 days (95% BCI -0·56 to 2·43). The probability that there was a clinically meaningful benefit of at least 1·5 days in time to recovery was 0·23. 16 (3%) of 500 participants in the azithromycin plus usual care group and 28 (3%) of 823 participants in the usual care alone group were hospitalised (absolute benefit in percentage 0·3%, 95% BCI -1·7 to 2·2). There were no deaths in either study group. Safety outcomes were similar in both groups. Two (1%) of 455 participants in the azothromycin plus usual care group and four (1%) of 668 participants in the usual care alone group reported admission to hospital during the trial, not related to COVID-19. INTERPRETATION: Our findings do not justify the routine use of azithromycin for reducing time to recovery or risk of hospitalisation for people with suspected COVID-19 in the community. These findings have important antibiotic stewardship implications during this pandemic, as inappropriate use of antibiotics leads to increased antimicrobial resistance, and there is evidence that azithromycin use increased during the pandemic in the UK.

As the crisis of its serious increasing dynamic outbreak in all parts of the globe, the forecast maps and analysis of confirmed cases (CS) becomes a vital great changeling task. In this study, a new forecasting model is presented to analyze and forecast the CS of COVID-19 for the coming days based on the reported data since 22 Jan 2020. The proposed forecasting model, named ISACL-MFNN, integrates an improved interior search algorithm (ISA) based on chaotic learning (CL) strategy into a multi-layer feed-forward neural network (MFNN). The ISACL incorporates the CL strategy to enhance the performance of ISA and avoid the trapping in the local optima. By this methodology, it is intended to train the neural network by tuning its parameters to optimal values and thus achieving high-accuracy level regarding forecasted results. The ISACL-MFNN model is investigated on the official data of the COVID-19 reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) to analyze the confirmed cases for the upcoming days. The performance regarding the proposed forecasting model is validated and assessed by introducing some indices including the mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and the comparisons with other optimization algorithms are presented. The proposed model is investigated in the most affected countries (i.e., USA, Italy, and Spain). The experimental simulations illustrate that the proposed ISACL-MFNN provides promising performance rather than the other algorithms while forecasting task for the candidate countries.","Rizk-Allah, Rizk M.; Hassanien, Aboul Ella",,47,10

A neutralizing antibody CC12.1 which was found in SARS-CoV-2 patient samples provides potential protection from disease. The aim of molecular dynamics simulations is to identify key epitopes that are crucial to the antibody binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein receptor binding domain (RBD) to promote the development of superior antibodies. Binding modes of the antibody were investigated and compared with RBD bound receptor ACE2. Key epitopes were revealed and a distal motif of RBD (residue numbers 473-488) was demonstrated by analyzing dynamic trajectories. Compared to the receptor ACE2, conformation of RBD could be better stabilized through additional interaction of antibody with the distal motif of RBD, which was further found driven by electrostatic complementarity. By further analysis of the extensive hydrogen-bonding networks, residues D405, K417, Y421, Y453, L455, R457, Y473, A475, N487, G502, Y505 of RBD, which mainly interacted with CDR H3/L3 and two conserved motifs SNY, SGGS, were identified as key epitopes. Higher binding free energy calculated after point mutations on key residues confirms the crucial role for the specific binding. Subsequently, mutations of VH V98E and VL G68D in CC12.1, which could significantly enhance the binding affinity of the antibody, were also proposed.

Clinical evidence indicates that vitamin D may reduce the risk of both upper and lower respiratory tract infections and offers benefit particularly in people with Vitamin D deficiency. Some evidence exists for a higher incidence of active TB in patients who are deficient in vitamin D. An association between low levels of 25(OH)D (the active form of vitamin D) and COVID-19 severity of illness and mortality has also been reported. In addition, low 25(OH)D levels are associated with poor outcomes in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The cytokine storm experienced in severe COVID-19 infections results from excessive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Due to its immunomodulatory effects, adequate Vitamin D levels may cause a decrease in the pro-inflammatory cytokines and an increase in the anti-inflammatory cytokines during Covid-19 infections. Vitamin D deficiency was found in 82.2% of hospitalized COVID-19 cases and 47.2% of population-based controls (p<0.0001). The available evidence warrants an evaluation of Vitamin D supplementation in susceptible populations with respiratory diseases such as TB, and particularly in those who are deficient in Vitamin D. This may mitigate against serious complications of Covid-19 infections or reduce the impact of ARDS in those who have been infected.","Chetty, Vasudevan V; Chetty, Manoranjenni",Clinical and translational science (Online),47,16

The objective of this review was to identify the incidence of smell and taste dysfunction in COVID-19, determine the onset of their symptoms and the risk factors of anosmia, hyposmia, ageusia or dysgeusia for COVID-19 infection. METHODS: We searched the PubMed and Google Scholar on 15th May 2020, with search terms including SARS-COV-2, coronavirus, COVID-19, hyposmia, anosmia, ageusia and dysgeusia. The articles included were cross sectional studies, observational studies and retrospective or prospective audits, letters to editor and short communications that included a study of a cohort of patients. Case reports, case-series and interventional studies were excluded. DISCUSSION: A total of 16 studies were selected. Incidence of smell and taste dysfunction was higher in Europe (34 to 86%), North America (19 to 71%) and the Middle East (36 to 98%) when compared to the Asian cohorts (11 to 15%) in COVID-19 positive patients. Incidence of smell and taste dysfunction in COVID-19 negative patients was low in comparison (12 to 27%). Total incidence of smell and taste dysfunction from COVID-19 positive and negative patients from seven studies was 20% and 10% respectively. Symptoms may appear just before, concomitantly, or immediately after the onset of the usual symptoms. Occurs predominantly in females. When occurring immediately after the onset of the usual symptoms, the median time of onset was 3.3 to 4.4 days. Symptoms persist for a period of seven to 14 days. Patients with smell and taste dysfunction were reported to have a six to ten-fold odds of having COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Smell and taste dysfunction has a high incidence in Europe, North America, and the Middle East. The incidence was lower in the Asia region. It is a strong risk factor for COVID-19. It may be the only symptom and should be added to the list of symptoms when screening for COVID- 19.","Wong, D K C; Gendeh, H S; Thong, H K; Lum, S G; Gendeh, B S; Saim, A; Salina, H",Med J Malaysia,47,24

In this study, we present the clinical features and treatment outcomes of twenty-seven COVID-19 positive patients with leukemia across seven different centers in Istanbul. From March 1st to December 31st 2020, 116 patients were diagnosed with acute leukemia. Thirty-two cases with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), 82 cases with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and 2 cases with mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) were identified. Of the 27 patients with the COVID-19 infection, seven patients had ALL, 19 patients had AML and one patient had MPAL. The mortality rate was 37% among the patients with AML, whereas there were no deaths in the ALL group. The mortality rate of AML patients with the COVID-19 infection was higher compared to cases without the infection (P<0.05). We could not detect any significant difference in the ALL cohort. This study, which includes one of the largest acute leukemia series in literature proved that acute myeloid leukemia patients with the COVID-19 infection have worse outcomes than patients without the infection. The high mortality among patients with acute leukemias hospitalized with COVID-19 highlight the need for aggressive infection prevention, increased surveillance and protective isolation and even modification of the therapy, in case of minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity.","Buyuktas, D.; Acar, K.; Sucak, G.; Toptas, T.; Kapucu, I.; Bekoz, H.; Erdem, S.; Nalcaci, M.; Atalay, F.; Akay, M.

Here, we have identified interleukin-8 (IL-8) as a biomarker candidate to predict different disease severity and prognosis of COVID-19 patients. While serum IL-6 become obviously elevated in severe COVID-19 patients, serum IL-8 was easily detectible in COVID-19 patients with mild syndromes. Furthermore, lL-8 levels correlated better than IL-6 levels with the overall clinical disease scores at different stages of the same COVID-19 patients.

However, the OER performance is still low, and especially, the overpotential is larger than 200 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm-2 . Herein, an Ir@IrNiO sample is prepared with single-atom (SA) Ir4+ doping and surface metallic Ir nanoparticles loaded onto the NiO. Owing to the bonding of the loaded Ir with surface-exposed Ni2+ , the nearby Ni atoms exist in the +3 valence state, that is, the surface-loaded Ir particles behave like a stabilizer for the Ni3+ sites. Under the synergistic effect of SA Ir4+ and high-valance-state Ni3+ , the Ir@IrNiO nanostructure effectively reduces the overpotential to 195 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 . Moreover, it gives an Ir-content-normalized current density of 0.0457 A mgIr -1 , 72.1 times higher than that of the best commercialized IrO2 (6.33 × 10-4 A mgIr -1 ), under the condition of 1.5 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode.

Data was obtained from a bespoke epilepsy electronic patient record (EPR). METHODS: Predetermined search parameters of well-established broad categories of epilepsy aetiology were used to identify patients with a diagnosis of epilepsy attending Beaumont Hospital, Dublin. There were 3216 patients that met the inclusion criteria for this study. We included living patients with epilepsy attending our institution. We then excluded patients with a diagnosis of pure non-epileptic attack disorder and patients found to have idiopathic generalised epilepsy (IGE) (n = 382) from our final cohort. We excluded IGE due to the complex polygenic basis underlying this patient group. RESULTS: An aetiology was identified in 54.3 % (n = 1747) of the total number of patients studied. Of the symptomatic epilepsies, 41.08 % (n = 1321) were acquired and 13.3 % (n = 426) were predominantly of genetic or developmental aetiology. The most common causes of the acquired epilepsies were hippocampal sclerosis (n = 380; 28.75 %), cerebral tumor (n = 279; 21.06 %), traumatic brain injury (n = 248; 18.77 %), stroke and cerebrovascular disease (n = 151; 11.43 %) and perinatal causes (n = 138; 10.45 %). The leading causes in the genetic / developmental category included cavernous haemangiomas (n = 62, 22.22 %), arteriovenous malformations (n = 59; 21.15 %) and cortical dysplasia (n = 55; 19.71 %). The aetiology of a patient's epilepsy was undetermined in 45.68 % (n = 1469) of individuals. CONCLUSION: This study emphasizes the clinical utility of the ILAE's 2017 revised classification of the epilepsies and highlights the evolving dynamic nature of attributing causality in epilepsy.

Coronaviruses are potentially neurotropic, which renders neuronal tissue vulnerable to infection, especially in elderly individuals or in those with neuro-comorbid conditions. Complaints of ageusia, anosmia, myalgia, and headache; reports of diseases such as stroke, encephalopathy, seizure, and encephalitis; and loss of consciousness in patients with COVID-19 confirm the neuropathophysiological aspect of this disease. The brain is linked to pulmonary organs, physiologically through blood circulation, and functionally through the nervous system. The interdependence of these vital organs may further aggravate the pathophysiological aspects of COVID-19. The induction of a cytokine storm in systemic circulation can trigger a neuroinflammatory cascade, which can subsequently compromise the blood-brain barrier and activate microglia- and astrocyte-borne Toll-like receptors, thereby leading to neuronal tissue damage. Hence, a holistic approach should be adopted by healthcare professionals while treating COVID-19 patients with a history of neurodegenerative disorders, neuropsychological complications, or any other neuro-compromised conditions. Imperatively, vaccines are being developed at top priority to contain the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, and different vaccines are at different stages of development globally. This review discusses the concerns regarding the neuronal complications of COVID-19 and the possible mechanisms of amelioration.","Kumar, Dipak; Jahan, Sadaf; Khan, Andleeb; Siddiqui, Arif Jamal; Redhu, Neeru Singh; Khan, Johra; Banwas, Saeed; Alshehri, Bader; Alaidarous, Mohammed",Mol Neurobiol,47,20

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severely affects aged subjects, determining an important prothrombotic status. The aim of this study was to evaluate mortality-related factors in older AF patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Between March and June 2020, we enrolled &#8805;60 year-old in-hospital COVID-19 patients (n = 806) in GeroCovid, a multicenter observational study promoted by the Italian Society of Gerontology and Geriatric Medicine. RESULTS: The prevalence of AF was 21.8%. In-hospital mortality was higher in the AF group (36.9 vs. 27.5%, p = 0.015). At admission, 51.7, 10.2, and 38.1% of AF cases were taking, respectively, oral anticoagulants (OACs), antiplatelet agents, and no antithrombotic therapy. During hospitalization, 51% patients switched to low-molecular-weight heparins. AF patients who survived were younger (81 ± 8 vs. 84 ± 7 years; p = 0.002) and had a lower CHA2DS2-VASc score (3.9 ± 1.6 vs. 4.4 ± 1.3; p = 0.02) than those who died. OAC use before (63.1 vs. 32.3%; p < 0.001) and during hospitalization (34.0 vs. 12.7%; p = 0.002) was higher among survivors. At multivariable analysis, lower age, higher self-sufficiency, less severe initial COVID-19 presentation, and the use of vitamin K antagonists (odds ratio [OR] = 0.16, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.03-0.84) or direct OACs (OR = 0.22, 95% CI: 0.08-0.56) at admission, or the persistence of OAC during hospitalization (OR = 0.05, 95% CI: 0.01-0.24), were associated with a lower chance of in-hospital death. CONCLUSION: AF is a prevalent and severe condition in older COVID-19 patients. Advanced age, dependency, and relevant clinical manifestations of disease characterized a worse prognosis. Preadmission and in-hospital anticoagulant therapies were positively associated with survival.","Fumagalli, Stefano; Trevisan, Caterina; Del Signore, Susanna; Pelagalli, Giulia; Volpato, Stefano; Gareri, Pietro; Mossello, Enrico; Malara, Alba; Monzani, Fabio; Coin, Alessandra; Bellelli, Giuseppe; Zia, Gianluca; Antonelli Incalzi, Raffaele",Thromb. haemost,47,1

In this study, Aeromonas hydrophila strains with different resistance levels to oxytetracycline (OXY) were induced by sublethal antibiotic selection pressure, and differential expression of proteins were compared among them using iTRAQ based quantitative proteomics. Our following bioinformatic analysis showed that energy metabolism related proteins were down-regulated, while several iron related proteins were up-regulated in high OXY-resistant strains. To further investigate the role of spontaneous OXY resistance evolution, four TonB-dependent receptor coded genes were deleted, and their OXY susceptibility capabilities and antibiotic evolutionary assays were performed, respectively. Our results showed that the deletion of these genes no affected the susceptibility to OXY, but showed different evolution rates in the spontaneous oxytetracycline evolution compared with wild-type strain, especially for AHA_0971 and AHA_4251. Therefore, this study indicated the important role of TonB-dependent receptor proteins during the bacterial antibiotics resistance evolution and may provide a new prophylactic strategy against the development of antibiotic resistance.

Sources of information: We reviewed relevant published literature, program-specific documents, and guidance documents from international societies. An informal survey of Canadian nephrologists was conducted to identify practice patterns and expert opinions. We hosted a national webinar with invited input and feedback after webinar. Methods: The Canadian Society of Nephrology (CSN) Board of Directors invited physicians with expertise in GN to contribute. Specific COVID-19-related themes in GN were identified, and consensus-based recommendations were made by this group of nephrologists. The recommendations received further peer input and review by Canadian nephrologists via a CSN-sponsored webinar. This was attended by 150 kidney health care professionals. The final consensus recommendations also incorporated review by Editors of the Canadian Journal of Kidney Health and Disease. Key findings: We identified 9 areas of GN management that may be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic: (1) clinic visit scheduling, (2) clinic visit type, (3) provision of multidisciplinary care, (4) blood and urine testing, (5) home-based monitoring essentials, (6) immunosuppression, (7) other medications, (8) patient education and support, and (9) employment. Limitations: These recommendations are expert opinion, and are subject to the biases associated with this level of evidence. To expedite the publication of this work, a parallel review process was created that may not be as robust as standard arm's length peer review processes. Implications: These recommendations are intended to provide optimal care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our recommendations may change based on the evolving evidence.","Moran, Sarah M; Barbour, Sean; Dipchand, Christine; Garland, Jocelyn S; Hladunewich, Michelle; Jauhal, Arenn; Kappel, Joanne E; Levin, Adeera; Pandeya, Sanjay; Reich, Heather N; Thanabalasingam, Susan; Thomas, Dorothy; Ma, Jeffrey C; White, Christine",Can J Kidney Health Dis,47,1

This has prompted the emergence of critical just-in-time COVID-19 education, including rapid simulation preparedness, evaluation and training across all healthcare sectors. Simulation has been proven to be pivotal for both healthcare provider learning and systems integration in the context of testing and integrating new processes, workflows, and rapid changes to practice (e.g., new cognitive aids, checklists, protocols) and changes to the delivery of clinical care. The individual, team, and systems learnings generated from proactive simulation training is occurring at unprecedented volume and speed in our healthcare system. Establishing a clear process to collect and report simulation outcomes has never been more important for staff and patient safety to reduce preventable harm. Our provincial simulation program in the province of Alberta, Canada (population = 4.37 million; geographic area = 661,848 km2), has rapidly responded to this need by leading the intake, design, development, planning, and co-facilitation of over 400 acute care simulations across our province in both urban and rural Emergency Departments, Intensive Care Units, Operating Rooms, Labor and Delivery Units, Urgent Care Centers, Diagnostic Imaging and In-patient Units over a 5-week period to an estimated 30,000 learners of real frontline team members. Unfortunately, the speed at which the COVID-19 pandemic has emerged in Canada may prevent healthcare sectors in both urban and rural settings to have an opportunity for healthcare teams to participate in just-in-time in situ simulation-based learning prior to a potential surge of COVID-19 patients. Our coordinated approach and infrastructure have enabled organizational learnings and the ability to theme and categorize a mass volume of simulation outcome data, primarily from acute care settings to help all sectors further anticipate and plan. The goal of this paper is to share the unique features and advantages of using a centralized provincial simulation response team, preparedness using learning and systems integration methods, and to share the highest risk and highest frequency outcomes from analyzing a mass volume of COVID-19 simulation data across the largest health authority in Canada.","Dubé, Mirette; Kaba, Alyshah; Cronin, Theresa; Barnes, Sue; Fuselli, Tara; Grant, Vincent",Adv Simul (Lond),47,26

Despite this, no countries or authorities consider airborne spread of COVID-19 in their regulations to prevent infections transmission indoors.

However, the epidemiology, management, and associated outcomes have varied greatly between studies. The pathophysiology remains unclear. Summary: The etiology of AKI in the setting of COVID-19 appears multifactorial. Systemic effects of sepsis, inflammation, and vascular injury likely play some role. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, highly expressed in the kidney, providing a route for direct infection. Older age, baseline comorbidities, and respiratory failure are strong risk factors for the development of AKI. Regardless of etiology, AKI carries a significantly increased risk for in-hospital mortality, especially in those with critical illness. Currently, management of AKI in patients with COVID-19 remains supportive. Key Messages: AKI is common in patients with COVID-19. Future studies are needed to examine the response to anti-viral treatment as well as long-term renal outcomes in patients with AKI.","Lynch, Matthew R; Tang, Jie",R I Med J (2013),47,22

Since the virus triggers COVID-19 infection through binding to ACE2, we focused on the ACE2 gene family, including ACE. Both ACE2 and ACE are involved in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). In general, ACE causes inflammation and vasoconstriction, while ACE2 leads to anti-inflammation activity and vasodilation. The disturbed balance between these counter-regulatory pathways could influence susceptibility to COVID-19. Notably, dysregulation of the RAS-equilibrium contributes to Alzheimer's disease. Differences in the incidence and symptoms of COVID-19 in diverse populations could be attributed to variability in the human genome. For example, ACE and ACE2 variations could modify the outcome of COVID-19 in different populations. It would be important to conduct genome-wide studies to detect variants influencing COVID-19 presentation, with a special focus on variants affecting immune-related pathways and expression of RAS-related genes.","Haghighi, Mahdi Montazer; Kakhki, Erfan Ghani; Sato, Christine; Ghani, Mahdi; Rogaeva, Ekaterina",Neurosci Insights,47,20

Analysis of B cell epitopes indicates the minor role of the stalk domain of spike protein in viral neutralization due to low surface accessibility. Nevertheless, the accumulation of mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) might reduce the vaccine efficacy in all age groups.

METHODS: Based on the daily reported new cases and the population-movement data between 1 and 31 January, we examined the effects of population outflow from Wuhan on the geographical expansion of the infection in other provinces and cities of China, as well as the impacts of the city closure in Wuhan using different closing-date scenarios. RESULTS: We observed a significantly positive association between population movement and the number of the COVID-19 cases. The spatial distribution of cases per unit of outflow population indicated that the infection in some areas with a large outflow of population might have been underestimated, such as Henan and Hunan provinces. Further analysis revealed that if the city-closure policy had been implemented 2 days earlier, 1420 (95% confidence interval, 1059-1833) cases could have been prevented, and if 2 days later, 1462 (1090-1886) more cases would have been possible.

In our experiments, the males of S. ovinae developed significantly higher forces on smooth surfaces. However, the forces were significantly lower on all the hymenopteran surfaces used in the experiment. The absence of anisotropy in the force grip in cranial/caudal direction relative to the host might indirectly indicate that S. ovinae generate forces rather by adhesion and not by mechanical interlocking with the host hairs. The tolerance of the attachment system of S. ovinae to the substrate chemistry might be explained by the primary contribution of van der Waals interactions and not capillary forces to adhesion in S. ovinae.","Pohl, Hans; Gorb, Elena V; Gorb, Stanislav N",J. exp. biol,47,20

Eligibility criteria for CCP donors includes documentation of evidence of COVID-19 either by viral RNA detection at the time of illness or positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG after recovery if diagnostic testing for COVID-19 was not performed at the time of illness. In addition to analysis of CCP, analysis of SARS-CoV-2 IgG provides information for possible past exposure and may support diagnosis when SARS-CoV-2 PCR is negative and clinical suspicion for COVID-19 is high. Furthermore, assays with high sensitivity and specificity for SARS-CoV-2 IgG are critical for understanding community exposure rates to SARS-CoV-2. Currently, there are several assays that test for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 using a variety of methods, including point-of-care lateral flow-based devices, high throughput immunoassay analyzers, and manual methods such as ELISA. These assays target a number of SARS-CoV-2 antigens, including the nucleocapsid protein (N), full length spike protein (S), S1 subunit, or receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein. Given the heterogeneity among methods for, and antigenic targets used in SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays, it is necessary for careful evaluation of these assays prior to implementation for clinical use. We compared two assays that had received the CE mark of regulatory approval and that used either the N antigen or S1-RBD antigen as the target for analysis of a large set of CCP samples. Our data indicates that sensitivity and specificity vary between these assays and that more than one antigenic target may be required to improve the sensitivity and specificity of IgG detection to SARS-CoV-2.","DomBourian, Melkon G; Annen, Kyle; Huey, Leah; Andersen, Gillian; Merkel, Patricia A; Jung, Sarah; Dominguez, Samuel R; Knight, Vijaya",J Immunol Methods,47,16

Materials and methods: The players from 36 professional football teams (n = 977) among Turkish Super League and First League teams were invited to complete a questionnaire including the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), Impact of Event Scale-Revised Scores (IES-R) and short form of International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Results: The online survey was completed by 237 players (24.3%). The mean number of self-quarantine day of participants was 26.9 ± 6.2 days. The median CES-D Scale and IES-R scores were 6.0 (min:0, max:42) and 23.0 (min:0, max:59), respectively. IPAQ scores of the players showed that four-fifths of the players still maintain high physical activity levels. There were negative, very weak and significant correlations between CES-D score and being married (r = -0.146, p = 0.024), as well as between CES-D score and IPAQ-Walking (r = -0.189, p = 0.004). A significant positive very weak correlation was observed between CES-D score and self-quarantine days (r = 0.148, p = 0.024). IPAQ-Walking was an independent predictor of CES-D. Conclusion: These findings support that maintaining regular physical activity and routinely exercising in a safe home environment is one of the most important strategies to ensure healthy mental state.","Dönmez, Gürhan; Özkan, Ömer; Menderes, Yigitcan; Torgutalp, Serife Seyma; Karaçoban, Levend; Denerel, Nevzad; Kudas, Savas",Phys Sportsmed,47,24

It has been reported previously that reinforcement learning can help realize mathematical models of students learning strategies to maintain a high memory rate. However, optimization using reinforcement learning requires a large number of interactions, and thus it cannot be applied directly to actual students. In this study, we propose a framework for optimizing teaching strategies by constructing a virtual model of the student while minimizing the interaction with the actual teaching target. In addition, we conducted an experiment considering actual instructions using the mathematical model and confirmed that the model performance is comparable to that of conventional teaching methods. Our framework can directly substitute mathematical models used in experiments with human students, and our results can serve as a buffer between theoretical instructional optimization and practical applications in e-learning systems.","Kubotani, Yoshiki; Fukuhara, Yoshihiro; Morishima, Shigeo",,47,22

Celiac disease Adherence Test (CDAT) is a valid English-language questionnaire that is used for assessing the adherence to the GFD. In the present study, we aimed to translate the CDAT questionnaire in Persian and evaluate its validity and reliability. METHODS: In the present cross-sectional study, CDAT was translated and back-translated by three bilingual professional translators. Content validity was evaluated by 12 gastroenterologists and nutritionists. To assess the construct validity, 230 patients with celiac disease were randomly selected from the national celiac disease registry database. Internal consistency of the items and test-retest reliability were assessed by Cronbach's alpha and Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC). To assess the convergent validity of the questionnaire, the correlation coefficient between the CDAT score and anti-tissue transglutaminase immunoglobulin A (anti-t-TG-IgA) titer was assessed. RESULTS: The content validity index, content validity ratio, and impact score of the Persian version of CDAT (Pv-CDAT) were 0.97, 0.95, and 4.61 respectively. Three significant factors were extracted and according to the confirmatory factor analysis the three-factor model had adequate fitness (chi-square p-value of 0.74, root mean error of approximation: 0.001 [95% CI: 0.001-0.083], comparative fit index: 1, standardized root mean squared residual: 0.04, and coefficient of determination: 0.78). The questionnaire had good feasibility with the floor effect of 3.1% and the ceiling effect of 0.4%. Moreover, it has high internal consistency (Cronbach-alpha: 0.71) and test-retest reliability (ICC: 0.78). The correlations between CDAT categories and anti-tTG-IgA categories showed a significant correlation between the two tests (r = 0.53; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study showed that the Pv-CDAT questionnaire with high validity, reliability, and internal consistency can be used for assessing adherence to the GFD in adult celiac patients in Iran.","Nikniaz, Zeinab; Asghari Jafarabadi, Mohammad; Ghaffarifar, Saeideh; Saeedi, Zahra; Akbari Namvar, Zahra; Shirmohammadi, Masood",BMC Gastroenterol,47,25

The fusion peptide (FP), a short peptide segment in the spike protein, plays a central role in the initial penetration of the virus into the host cell membrane, followed by the fusion of the two membranes. Here, we use an array of molecular dynamics simulations that take advantage of the highly mobile membrane mimetic model to investigate the interaction of the SARS-CoV2 FP with a lipid bilayer representing mammalian cellular membranes at an atomic level and to characterize the membrane-bound form of the peptide. Six independent systems were generated by changing the initial positioning and orientation of the FP with respect to the membrane, and each system was simulated in five independent replicas, each for 300 ns. In 73% of the simulations, the FP reaches a stable, membrane-bound configuration, in which the peptide deeply penetrated into the membrane. Clustering of the results reveals three major membrane-binding modes (binding modes 1-3), in which binding mode 1 populates over half of the data points. Taking into account the sequence conservation among the viral FPs and the results of mutagenesis studies establishing the role of specific residues in the helical portion of the FP in membrane association, the significant depth of penetration of the whole peptide, and the dense population of the respective cluster, we propose that the most deeply inserted membrane-bound form (binding mode 1) represents more closely the biologically relevant form. Analysis of FP-lipid interactions shows the involvement of specific residues, previously described as the ""fusion-active core residues,"" in membrane binding. Taken together, the results shed light on a key step involved in SARS-CoV2 infection, with potential implications in designing novel inhibitors.","Gorgun, Defne; Lihan, Muyun; Kapoor, Karan; Tajkhorshid, Emad",Biophys J,47,16

Currently, curative drugs or vaccines are lacking, and the standard of care is limited to symptom management. Natural products like ginger, turmeric, garlic, onion, cinnamon, lemon, neem, basil, and black pepper have been scientifically proven to have therapeutic benefits against acute respiratory tract infections including pulmonary fibrosis, diffuse alveolar damage, pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome, as well as associated septic shock, lung and kidney injury, all of which are symptoms associated with COVID-19 infection. This review highlights the potential of these natural products to serve as home-based, inexpensive, easily accessible, prophylactic agents against COVID-19.","Thota, Sai Manohar; Balan, Venkatesh; Sivaramakrishnan, Venketesh",Phytother. res,47,24

The first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Bangladesh on 8th March, 2020 and consequently the country went into lockdown on 26 March, 2020. This study has made a survey of vegetables farmers through a mobile phone to understand the impact of COVID-19 on vegetables supply chain, gross margin and the future production plan of the growers. In Bangladesh, the lockdown has disrupted the food supply chain and increases the likelihood of food insecurity. Lockdown has impeded vegetable farmers' access to markets, thus limiting their productive and sales capacities. The price of yield has dropped by more than half resulting in huge loss for vegetable growers. The loss incurred by the farmers for producing Brinjal, Cucumber, Pointed gourd, Yardlong beans and Bottle gourd are BDT 4900, BDT 10900, BDT 57400, BDT 52500 and BDT 18500 per acre respectively as a result of COVID-19. The decreased income increases farmers' likelihood of vulnerability and food insecurity and poses a challenge to continued produce. 'Cash support' is more important than 'food support' in order to keep vegetable farmers in farming, to ensure a ready supply of necessary low-cost resources, and to help fight against the upcoming food shortage.","Alam, G M Monirul; Khatun, Most Nilufa",PLoS One,47,24

One safety precaution has been the implementation of universal preoperative screening for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This study examines the results of universal screening on children undergoing orthopaedic surgery. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study evaluating the incidence and symptomatology of COVID-19 in all patients presenting for orthopaedic surgery at 3 pediatric tertiary care children's hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic (March to June 2020). All patients underwent universal screening with a nasopharyngeal swab to detect presence of SARS-CoV-2. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors for positive COVID-19 screening. RESULTS: In total, 1198 patients underwent preoperative screening across all 3 institutions and 7 (0.58%) had detection of SARS-CoV-2. The majority of patients (1/7, 86%) were asymptomatic. Patients that tested positive were significantly more likely to be Hispanic (P=0.046) and had greater number of medical comorbidities (P=0.013), as scored on the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status score. A known COVID-19 positive contact was found to be a significant risk factor in the multivariate analysis (P=0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Early results of universal preoperative screening for COVID-19 demonstrates a low incidence and high rate of asymptomatic patients. Health care professionals, especially those at higher risk for the virus, should be aware of the challenges related to screening based solely on symptoms or travel history and consider universal screening for patients undergoing elective surgery.

Existing literature in international relations rarely focuses on virus outbreaks as factors affecting international relations between superpower countries, nor does research examine an outbreak's potential influence on the public's opinion about their country's foreign policy. To bridge this research gap, this study explores the extent to which the American public may be prone to favor policies that ""punish"" China via existing U.S.-China disputes, such as the South China Sea dispute and the U.S.-China trade war. I conducted an online survey using Amazon's Mechanical Turk and ran multinomial and ordered logit models to estimate the association between an individual's preferred policies and the country or government an individual blame for the impact of the pandemic. After controlling several essential confounding factors, such as one's levels of nationalism and hawkishness, I found strong evidence that there is a positive association between people's attribution of blame to the Chinese government and the likelihood of supporting aggressive policy options in the two disputes with China. That is to say, U.S. citizens who believe that the Chinese government is solely culpable for the outbreak in the U.S., compared to those who think otherwise, are more likely to support hawkish policy options, such as confrontational military actions, economic sanctions, or higher tariff rates. The research provides a glimpse into where Americans may stand in these disputes with China and the potential development of U.S.-China relations in the post-pandemic era.","Lin, Hsuan-Yu",J Chin Polit Sci,47,16

Methods: A multicenter cross-sectional survey was conducted from May 15 to June 15, 2020 in five tertiary eye care hospitals in South India to assess the KAP towards COVID-19. Each of the hospitals belonged to one of the three different zones assigned in India based on number of infections. Red zones represent hotspots and orange/green zones represent regions with medium and lower caseloads, respectively. A validated questionnaire was administered through telephone and responses were recorded on a Google form. Results: Out of the total (n = 6119) participants, 3081 were from hospitals in green zone, 2110 from the orange zone, and 928 from red zone. Majority of participants were above 50 years of age (42%) and 15.54% were illiterate. The mean (percentage) scores of knowledge, attitude, and practice were 21.26 (82%), 9.37 (92%), and 10.32 (86%), respectively. KAP among patients more than 50 years of age and in illiterate individuals was significantly less (P < 0.01) when compared with all other groups. Participants from red zone had a significantly better attitude (P < 0.01) compared to other centers. Conclusion: Although the overall KAP regarding COVID-19 disease was robust (above 80% in all categories) in our participants, the high risk elderly population (>50 years) and illiterate individuals had a significantly lower KAP. These are populations in which education should be emphasized and appropriately delivered as a way to reduce COVID-19 risk.","Christy, Josephine S; Kaur, Kirandeep; Gurnani, Bharat; Hess, Olivia M; Narendran, Kalpana; Venugopal, Anitha; Anuja, J; Manohar, Divya; Raman, Ramalakshmi; Venkatesh, Rengaraj",Indian J Ophthalmol,47,16

A novel coronavirus, the so-called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was found to be responsible for this outbreak potentially originating from pangolins. In China, the outbreak lasted for 1 month until it seemed to be controlled after affecting over 81,000 individuals and causing deaths in over 4200 patients. Subsequently, and after affecting over 118,000 individuals and causing over 4200 deaths, the condition was officially announced as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). In the meantime, the epidemic curve took a downtrend in China, the original epicenter of the pandemic, but started to rise in other countries with a steep slope. Among over 215 affected countries, the USA, European countries (Italy, Germany, Spain, France, the UK), Iran, and South Korea had the highest frequencies in the matters of infected patients and deaths. Importantly, different countries took different policies when encountered with an outbreak, especially in the matter of accuracy of the report and timing of the action. A part of the delays in reporting was expected, including the lag in the chain of reporting, the shortcomings of tests, missed patients, and inadequate testing facilities. However, there were also political and nontechnical reasons that caused the reporting to be inaccurate. Surveillance seems to be less of a reason for the observed in poor management, and it mostly originated from human decision-making failures and political issues. Besides, the culture of populations and their trust in their governments played an important role on how they reacted to the COVID-19 pandemic and acquired policies. Finally, the characteristics of the world today indicate the danger of probable upcoming outbreaks, and policymakers should utilize the existing opportunities, particularly the advancements in technology and media, to prevent or adequately manage them.","Hanaei, Sara; Mohebi, Farnam; Moradi-Lakeh, Maziar; Jabbari, Parnian; Mehta, Surinder Kumar; Kryvenko, Liudmyla S; Luongo, Livio; Dupré, Lodc; Rezaei, Nima",Adv Exp Med Biol,47,26

METHODS: We analyzed annual changes in four aspects of wellbeing over five years (2015-2020): life satisfaction, financial satisfaction, self-rated health, and loneliness in a subsample (n=1071, aged 60-71) from a larger survey of Swedish older adults. The 2020 wave, collected March 26-April 2, included measures of worry, risk perception, and social distancing in response to COVID-19. RESULTS: 1) In relation to COVID-19: 44.9% worried about health, 69.5% about societal consequences, 25.1% about financial consequences; 86.4% perceived a high societal risk, 42.3% a high risk of infection, and 71.2% reported high levels of social distancing. 2) Wellbeing remained stable (life satisfaction and loneliness) or even increased (self-rated health and financial satisfaction) in 2020 compared to previous years. 3) More worry about health and financial consequences was related to lower scores in all four wellbeing measures. Higher societal worry and more social distancing were related to higher wellbeing. DISCUSSION: In the early stage of the pandemic, Swedish older adults on average rated their wellbeing as high as, or even higher than, previous years. However, those who worried more reported lower wellbeing. Our findings speak to the resilience, but also heterogeneity, among older adults during the pandemic. Further research, on a broad range of health factors and long-term psychological consequences, is needed.","Kivi, Marie; Hansson, Isabelle; Bjälkebring, Pär",,47,29

Specifically, we highlight the deployment of telepsychology services during the pandemic by an integrated, trainee-based women & addictions program that provides care via a multidisciplinary team, including an obstetrician, addiction medicine fellow, nurse, behavioral health trainees, violence prevention advocates, and pediatric provider. METHODS: We outline unique adaptations that the program made to shift from in-person psychology trainee services to telepsychology. Additionally, we describe supporting factors and barriers to success for continued treatment planning, service provision, and educational training. RESULTS: The program identified and addressed numerous opportunities for improvement to implement and continue telepsychology within an integrated women & addictions program during the COVID-19 pandemic. The program maintained the unique components of care integration with the proliferation of digital resources for patients and providers, as well as the flexibility of attending physicians and supervising psychologists. CONCLUSIONS: Provision of telepsychology services within an integrated women & addictions program employing trainees is crucial during the COVID-19 pandemic. The program addressed barriers to care in creative ways, through the use of various technologies, to meet patients where they are.

Here we investigated how the COVID-19 pandemic and unprecedented lockdown affected the mental health of young adults in England and Wales. We compared the mental health symptoms of up to 4,000 twins in their mid-twenties in 2018 prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (T1) to those in a four-wave longitudinal data collection during the pandemic in April, July, and October 2020, and in March 2021 (T2-T5). The average changes in mental health were small-to-medium and mainly occurred from 2018 (T1) to March 2020 (T2, one month following the start of lockdown; average Cohen d=0.14). Despite the expectation of catastrophic effects on the pandemic on mental health of our young adults, we did not observe trends in worsening mental health during the pandemic (T3-T5). Young people with pre-existing mental health problems were adversely affected at the beginning of the pandemic, but their increased problems largely subsided as the pandemic persisted. Twin analyses indicated that the aetiology of individual differences did not change during the lockdown. The average heritability of mental health symptoms was 33% across 5 waves of assessment, and the average genetic correlation between T1 and T2-T5 was .95, indicating that genetic effects before the pandemic (T1) are substantially correlated with genetic effects up to a year later (T2-T5).

The pandemic is not only a health crisis but also a crisis of global governance. For example, the nation states in dealing with the crises of the pandemic have turned inwards, toward native and national solutions, and therefore away from the much-needed global cooperation to respond to the pandemic. This is an important concern for systems medicine and integrative biology in both normative and instrumental sense. Moreover, if we are to ""pandemic-proof"" the planet and the life science innovation ecosystem, new ways of understanding global governance are called for. This article examines the ways in which national governments have reacted to the crises triggered and embodied by the COVID-19 pandemic, surfaces the different approaches and conflicts between scientific experts and policy makers, and reveals the failure of science and politics. I analyze the uneven and disjointed way Western democratic governments have responded to the crisis and the way unchecked normative values and ideas have influenced the pandemic policy and prevented effective measures to contain the pandemic. Finally, the complex relationships between politics, knowledge, science, and governments are explored and clarified, and the way the COVID-19 crisis highlighted the long-standing tensions between technocracy and democracy. In conclusion, it is time to think critically and reflexively for all knowledge actors in systems science and innovate both planetary health and its global governance.","Boschele, Marco",OMICS,47,16

This region, where hunting, butchering, and consumption of wild animal meat is frequent, represents a hotspot for disease emergence, and has experienced zoonotic disease spillover events, traced back to close human-animal contact with bats and non-human primates. Using a One Health approach, we conducted wildlife surveillance, human behavioral research, and concurrent human and animal biological sampling to identify and characterize factors associated with zoonotic disease emergence and transmission. Research was conducted through the USAID Emerging Pandemic Threats program between 2010 and 2019 including qualitative studies of bushmeat markets, with selected study sites prioritized based on proximity to bushmeat markets. Sites included two hospitals where we conducted surveillance of individuals with syndromes of acute febrile illness, community sites where we enrolled actors of the animal value chain (ie. hunters, middlemen, transporters), and bushmeat markets, where we enrolled bushmeat vendors, butchers, market managers, cleaners, and shoppers. Mixed methods research was undertaken at these sites and included investigation of bushmeat market dynamics through observational research, focus group discussions, quantitative questionnaires, and interviews. Participants were asked about their risk perception of zoonotic disease transmission and specific activities related to bushmeat trade, local market conditions, and regulations on bushmeat trade in Cameroon. Risks associated with blood contact and animal infection were not well understood by most market actors. As bushmeat markets are an important disease interface, as seen with CoVID19, risk mitigation measures in markets and bushmeat alternative strategies are discussed.","Saylors, Karen E; Mouiche, Moctar M; Lucas, Ashley; McIver, David J; Matsida, Annie; Clary, Catherine; Maptue, Victorine T; Euren, Jason D; LeBreton, Matthew; Tamoufe, Ubald",Soc Sci Med,47,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a case-control study with cases being those with severe disease, defined as ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, death or discharge to hospice, and controls being those with non-severe disease. Predictor variables included patient demographics, symptoms and past medical history. Participants were 556 patients with laboratory confirmed Covid-19 and were included consecutively after presenting to the emergency department at a tertiary care center from March 1, 2020 to April 21, 2020 RESULTS: Most common symptoms included cough (82%), dyspnea (75%), and fever/chills (77%), with 96% reporting at least one of these. Multivariable logistic regression analysis found that increasing age (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.06), dyspnea (OR, 2.56; 95% CI: 1.51-4.33), male sex (OR, 1.70; 95% CI: 1.10-2.64), immunocompromised status (OR, 2.22; 95% CI: 1.17-4.16) and CKD (OR, 1.76; 95% CI: 1.01-3.06) were significant predictors of severe Covid-19 infection. Hyperlipidemia was found to be negatively associated with severe disease (OR, 0.54; 95% CI: 0.33-0.90). A predictive equation based on these variables demonstrated fair ability to discriminate severe vs non-severe outcomes using only this historical information (AUC: 0.76). CONCLUSIONS: Severe Covid-19 illness can be predicted using data that could be obtained from a remote screening. With validation, this model could possibly be used for remote triage to prioritize evaluation based on susceptibility to severe disease while avoiding unnecessary waiting room exposure.","Ryan, Charles; Minc, Alexa; Caceres, Juan; Balsalobre, Alexandra; Dixit, Achal; Ng, Becky KaPik; Schmitzberger, Florian; Syed-Abdul, Shabbir; Fung, Christopher",Am. j. emerg. med,47,1

METHODS: We conducted a survey on daily person-to-person contacts during the early phase of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Finland, one month after strong social distancing measures had been introduced nationwide. We defined a contact as exchange of at least a few words in proximity of another person. We also considered physical (""skin-to-skin"") contacts separately. Based on 3,171 reported contacts by 1,320 participants of 1-79 years of age, we estimated age-stratified contact matrices essential in modeling virus transmission. RESULTS: Compared with contacts during prepandemic conditions, as learned from the Finnish part of the Polymod study, there was a 72% (95% credible interval, CI = 71, 74) reduction in the daily number of all contacts and a 69% (95% CI = 66, 73) reduction in the daily number of physical contacts in April 2020. The largest reduction, of almost 90%, occurred in physical contacts by individuals more than 70 years of age. The estimated reduction in the transmission potential of the virus attributable solely to reduced contact frequencies varied between 59% (whole population; physical contacts; 95% CI = 52, 68) and 77% (over 20-year olds; physical contacts; 95% CI = 70, 89). CONCLUSIONS: We surmise that the large reduction in the daily numbers of social contacts in the early part of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Finland was likely a major contributor to the steady decline of the epidemic in the country since early April.","Auranen, Kari; Shubin, Mikhail; Karhunen, Markku; Sivelä, Jonas; Leino, Tuija; Nurhonen, Markku",Epidemiology,47,22

We describe the patient characteristics, program characteristics, and clinical outcomes of patients in our RPM program. METHODS: We enrolled COVID-19 patients being discharged home from the hospital. Enrolled patients had an app, and were provided with a pulse oximeter and thermometer. Patients self-reported symptoms, O2 saturation, and temperature daily. Abnormal symptoms or vital signs were flagged and assessed by a pool of nurses. Descriptive statistics were used to describe patient and program characteristics. A mixed-effects logistic regression model was used to determine the odds of a combined endpoint of emergency department (ED) or hospital readmission. RESULTS: A total of 295 patients were referred for RPM from five participating hospitals, and 225 patients were enrolled. A majority of enrolled patients (66%) completed the monitoring period without triggering an abnormal alert. Enrollment was associated with a decreased odds of ED or hospital readmission (adjusted odds ratio: 0.54; 95% confidence interval: 0.3-0.97; p = 0.039). Referral without enrollment was not associated with a reduced odds of ED or hospital readmission. CONCLUSION: RPM for COVID-19 provides a mechanism to monitor patients in their home environment and reduce hospital utilization. Our work suggests that RPM reduces readmissions for patients with COVID-19 and provides scalable remote monitoring capabilities upon hospital discharge.

RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is the prime component of viral replication/proliferation machinery and is considered to be a potential drug target against SARS-CoV-2. Present study investigated the anti-RdRp activity of phytochemicals against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Virtual ligand screening was carried out to determine the potent compounds against RdRp. Molecular docking and MD Simulation study was employed to evaluate the spatial affinity of selected phytochemicals for the active sites of RdRp. Structural stability of target compounds was determined using RMSD computational analysis and drug like abilities were investigated using ADMET. Bond distance between ligand and receptor were marked to predict the strength of interaction. Aloe, azadirachtin, columbin, cirsilineol, nimbiol, nimbocinol and sage exhibited highest binding affinity and interacted with active sites of RdRp surpassing the ability of chloroquine, lamivudine, favipiravir and remdesivir to target the same. All the natural metabolites exhibited stable conformation during MD Simulation of 101ns at 310K. Kinetic, potential and electrostatic energy were observed to be least in case of natural metabolites in comparison to synthetic analogs. Deviation and fluctuations were observed to be structurally least in target phytochemicals. Physiochemical and biological properties of these compounds further validated their drug like properties. Non-bonded distance was found to be short enough to form hydrogen bonding or hydrophobic interactions which revealed that these target compounds can strongly bind with RdRp. The study brings forth the potential phytochemicals to disrupt the replication domain of SARS-CoV-2 by hindering RdRp. We therefore anticipate that the current findings could be considered as valuable for development of an efficient preventive/therapeutic expedient against COVID-19.","Balkrishna, Acharya; Mittal, Rashmi; Sharma, Gunjan; Arya, Vedpriya",New Microbes New Infect,47,23

This crisis also reveals the brittleness of existing medical services, such as over-centralization of medical resources, the hysteresis of medical services digitalization, and weak security and privacy protection of medical data. The integration of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) and blockchain is expected to be a panacea to COVID-19 attributed to the ubiquitous presence and the perception of IoMT as well as the enhanced security and immutability of the blockchain. However, the synergy of IoMT and blockchain is also faced with challenges in privacy, latency, and context-absence. The emerging edge intelligence technologies bring opportunities to tackle these issues. In this article, we present a blockchain-empowered edge intelligence for IoMT in addressing the COVID-19 crisis. We first review IoMT, edge intelligence, and blockchain in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. We then present an architecture of blockchain-empowered edge intelligence for IoMT after discussing the opportunities of integrating blockchain and edge intelligence. We next offer solutions to COVID-19 brought by blockchain-empowered edge intelligence from 1) monitoring and tracing COVID-19 pandemic origin, 2) traceable supply chain of injectable medicines and COVID-19 vaccines, and 3) telemedicine and remote healthcare services.

DATA SYNTHESIS: Pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection are at high risk for severe acute respiratory syndrome and adverse outcomes. Pregnant women with severe COVID-19 present increased rates of preterm delivery (<37 gestational weeks), cesarean delivery and neonatal admissions to the intensive care unit. Comorbidity such as diabetes (pregestational or gestational) or obesity further increased maternal and fetal complications. It is known that diabetic or obese patients with COVID-19 present an unfavorable course and a worse prognosis, with a direct association between worse outcome and suboptimal glycol-metabolic control or body mass index (BMI) levels. Critical COVID-19 infection prevention is important for both mother and fetus. Vaccination during pregnancy is a common practice. Vaccines against COVID-19 are distributed across the world with some population considered to have a priority. Since pregnant women are excluded from clinical trials very little information are available on safety and efficacy of COVD-19 vaccines during pregnancy. However, it is well known the concept of passive immunization of the newborn obtained with transplacental passage of protective antibodies into the fetal/neonatal circulation after maternal infection or vaccination. Moreover, it has been reported that COVID-19 vaccine-induced IgG pass to the neonates through breastmilk. Therefore, maternal vaccination can protect mother, fetus and baby. CONCLUSIONS: After an individual risk/benefit evaluation pregnant and lactating women should be counselled to receive COVID-19 vaccines.","Sculli, Maria Angela; Formoso, Gloria; Sciacca, Laura",Nutr Metab Cardiovasc Dis,47,25

OBJECTIVE: To review the extracardiac radiologic findings of MIS-C in a group of children and young adults with a confirmed diagnosis of MIS-C. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a retrospective study from April 1, 2020, to July 31, 2020, we reviewed the imaging studies of 47 children and adolescents diagnosed with MIS-C, 25 females (53%) and 22 males (47%), with an average age of 8.4 years (range 1.3-20 years). Forty-five had chest radiographs, 8 had abdominal radiographs, 13 had abdominal US or MRI, 2 had neck US, and 4 had brain MRI. RESULTS: Thirty-seven of 45 (82%) patients with chest radiographs had findings, with pulmonary opacities being the most common finding (n=27, 60%), most often bilateral and diffuse, followed by peribronchial thickening (n=26, 58%). Eight patients had normal chest radiographs. On abdominal imaging, small-volume ascites was the most common finding (n=7, 54%). Other findings included right lower quadrant bowel wall thickening (n=3, 23%), gallbladder wall thickening (n=3, 23%), and cervical (n=2) or abdominal (n=2) lymphadenopathy. Of the four patients with brain MRI, one had bilateral parieto-occipital abnormalities and another papilledema. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of MIS-C and its distinction from other pathologies should be primarily based on clinical presentation and laboratory evidence of inflammation because imaging findings are nonspecific. However, it should be considered in the setting of bilateral diffuse pulmonary opacities, peribronchial thickening, right lower quadrant bowel inflammation or unexplained ascites in a child presenting with Kawasaki-like symptoms and a history of COVID-19 infection or recent COVID-19 exposure.","Fenlon Iii, Edward P; Chen, Susie; Ruzal-Shapiro, Carrie B; Jaramillo, Diego; Maddocks, Alexis B R",Pediatr. radiol,47,33

Older individuals are deemed to be at higher risk for poor outcomes with COVID-19. Although previous studies have shown a high proportion of older providers nationwide across medical specialties, we are not aware of any previous study that has analyzed the age distribution among the orthopaedic workforce. Therefore, the purposes of the present study were (1) to determine the geographic distribution of U.S. orthopaedic surgeons by age, (2) to compare the distribution with other surgical specialties, and (3) to compare this distribution with the spread of COVID-19. METHODS: Demographic statistics from the most recent State Physician Workforce Data Reports published by the Association of American Medical Colleges were extracted to identify the 2018 statewide proportion of practicing orthopaedic surgeons &#8805;60 years of age as well as age-related demographic data for all surgical specialties. Geospatial data on the distribution of COVID-19 cases were obtained from the Environmental Systems Research Institute. State boundary files were taken from the U.S. Census Bureau. Orthopaedic workforce age data were utilized to group states into quintiles. RESULTS: States with the highest quintile of orthopaedic surgeons &#8805;60 years of age included states most severely affected by COVID-19: New York, New Jersey, California, and Florida. For all states, the median number of providers &#8805;60 years of age was 105.5 (interquartile range [IQR], 45.5 to 182.5). The median proportion of orthopaedic surgeons &#8805;60 years of age was higher than that of all other surgical subspecialties, apart from thoracic surgery. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, the present report provides the first age-focused view of the orthopaedic workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic. States in the highest quintile of orthopaedic surgeons &#8805;60 years old are also among the most overwhelmed by COVID-19. As important orthopaedic acute care continues in addition to COVID-19 frontline service, special considerations may be needed for at-risk staff. Appropriate health system measures and workforce-management strategies should protect the subset of those who are most potentially vulnerable. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level IV.

We dissected its detection efficiency with a large COVID-19 cohort study. Methods: We analyzed SARS-CoV-2 NAT positive rates of 4,275 specimens from 532 COVID-19 patients in Sichuan Province with different disease severities, statuses, and stages, as well as different types and numbers of specimens. Results: The total positive rate of the 4,275 specimens was 37.5%. Among seven specimen types, BALF generated a 77.8% positive rate, followed by URT specimens (38.5%), sputum (39.8%), and feces/rectal swabs (34.1%). Specimens from critical cases generated a 43.4% positive rate, which was significantly higher than that of other severities. With specimens from patients at stable status, the SARS-CoV-2 positive rate was 40.6%, which was significantly higher than that of improved status (17.1%), but lower than that of aggravated status (61.5%). Notably, the positive rate of specimens from COVID-19 patients varied significantly from 85 to 95% during 3 days before and after symptom onset, to 20% at around 18 days after symptom onset. In addition, the detection rate increased from 72.1% after testing one throat swab, to 93.2% after testing three consecutive respiratory specimens from each patient. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 NAT detection rates vary with patient disease severity and status, specimen type, number of specimens, and especially disease progression. Sampling as close to symptom onset as possible, and consecutively collecting more than one respiratory specimen could effectively improve SARS-CoV-2 NAT detection efficiency.","Zhang, Jie; Li, Kecheng; Zheng, Ling; Zhang, Jianbo; Ren, Zhilin; Song, Tiange; Yu, Hua; Yang, Zhenglin; Wang, Li; Jiang, Li",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,47,21

The virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. Human infection with SARS-CoV-2 leads to a wide range of clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic, mild, moderate to severe. The severe cases present with pneumonia, which can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome. The outbreak provides an opportunity for real-time tracking of an animal coronavirus that has just crossed species barrier to infect humans. The outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection is largely determined by virus-host interaction. Here, we review the discovery, zoonotic origin, animal hosts, transmissibility and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 in relation to its interplay with host antiviral defense. A comparison with SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, community-acquired human coronaviruses and other pathogenic viruses including human immunodeficiency viruses is made. We summarize current understanding of the induction of a proinflammatory cytokine storm by other highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, their adaptation to humans and their usurpation of the cell death programmes. Important questions concerning the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and host antiviral defence, including asymptomatic and presymptomatic virus shedding, are also discussed.","Fung, Sin-Yee; Yuen, Kit-San; Ye, Zi-Wei; Chan, Chi-Ping; Jin, Dong-Yan",Emerg Microbes Infect,47,19

METHODS: A randomized, open-label controlled trial of oral favipiravir in adults hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia from June 22nd 2020 to August 13th 2020 was conducted. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either a combination of favipiravir with interferon beta-1b by inhalation aerosol or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). The outcome endpoints included improvement in inflammatory markers, lower length of hospital stay (LOS), discharges and lower overall 14-day mortality. RESULTS: A total of 89 patients underwent randomization with 49% (n = 44) assigned to favipiravir and 51% (n = 45) assigned HCQ. The overall mean age was 55 ± 14 years and 58% (n = 52) were males. There were no significant differences in the inflammatory biomarkers at hospital discharge between the two groups; C-reactive protein (p = 0.413), ferritin (p = 0.968), lactate dehydrogenase (p = 0.259) and interleukin 6 (p = 0.410). There were also no significant differences between the two groups with regards to the overall LOS (7 vs 7 days; p = 0.948), transfers to the ICU (18.2% vs 17.8%; p = 0.960), discharges (65.9% vs 68.9%; p = 0.764) and overall mortality (11.4% vs 13.3%; p = 0.778).

This outbreak threatens not only physical health but also has significant repercussions on mental health. In recent world history, major infectious outbreaks were associated with severe mental health sequelae, including suicide. In this study,we systematically review the literature on suicidal outcomes during major international respiratory outbreaks, including COVID-19. We reviewed descriptive and analytic articles addressing suicide during major international respiratory outbreaks. We searched PubMed, Medline, Embase, Scopus, and PsycInfo databases and then utilized an independent method for study selection by a pair of reviewers. Two reviewers completed data abstraction and conducted a narrative summary of the findings. Our search generated 2,153 articles. Nine studies (three descriptive, five analytical, and one with mixed methodology) were eligible. The included studies were heterogeneous, divergent in methods, and with a low degree of evidence. Deducing an association between pandemics, suicide, and suicide-related outcomes remains thus poorly supported. Future research with better methodological characteristics, the use of longitudinal studies, and a focus on suicide as the primary outcome would allow for an in-depth understanding and formulation of the scope of this problem.","Kahil, Karine; Cheaito, Mohamad Ali; El Hayek, Rawad; Nofal, Marwa; El Halabi, Sarah; Kudva, Kundadak Ganesh; Pereira-Sanchez, Victor; El Hayek, Samer",Asian J Psychiatr,47,22

The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety of treatment with biotechnological drugs in patients suffering from moderate–severe psoriasis and subjected to the prophylactic vaccination against SARS-Cov-2. Additionally, the secondary objective of the research is to investigate the existence of a possible impact of anti-COVID-19 vaccination on the natural chronic-relapsing course and the severity of the psoriatic disease. The study included 436 patients with moderate–severe psoriasis, both male and female, in treatment with biologics. The data were collected using the direct interview method. A reduction of 74.13% of average Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI )compared to baseline (T0) was found in all subjects; this does not differ significantly from the group that underwent vaccination (73.4%). Moreover; at the end of the study, neither mild nor severe adverse events (ADR) were observed among them. In conclusion, biotechnological drugs used in the management of patients with moderate–severe psoriasis demonstrate a high safety profile also in subjects immunized against SARS-Cov-2.","Skroza, Nevena; Bernardini, Nicoletta; Tolino, Ersilia; Proietti, Ilaria; Mambrin, Alessandra; Marchesiello, Anna; Marraffa, Federica; Rossi, Giovanni; Volpe, Salvatore; Potenza, Concetta",J Clin Med,47,3

The study aimed to investigate the antimicrobial activity of propolis against microbial species associated with caries, periodontal disease, and Candida infections. Two commercially available ethanolic extracts of Brazilian and one of European propolis (EEP) were used. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of propolis and controls against eight microbial strains were determined. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM) images visualized the effect of propolis on microorganisms. Subsequently, the activity on three different multi-species biofilms (both formation and existing biofilms) was assessed. All MIC values of the Brazilian EEPs were low against the tested oral species (≤0.1 mg/mL–3.13 mg/mL propolis (Candida albicans)). The European EEP had slightly higher MICs than the Brazilian EEPs. The SEM and TEM images suggest an interaction of propolis with the microbial cell wall. The European EEP exhibited the strongest effect on retarding biofilm formation, whereas the Brazilian EEPs were highly active against preformed biofilms (100 mg/mL propolis of both EEPs reduced colony forming unit counts always by more than 6 log10). The antimicrobial and anti-biofilm activities point to the potential of propolis as an adjunct in oral health care products.","Stähli, Alexandra; Schröter, Hannah; Bullitta, Simonetta; Serralutzu, Francesca; Dore, Antonio; Nietzsche, Sandor; Milia, Egle; Sculean, Anton; Eick, Sigrun",Antibiotics (Basel),47,33

Work overcommitment, work-family conflict, permissiveness toward alcohol in the workplace, and the likelihood of promotion are all implicated but have yet to be systematically investigated. Data were collected from 2,863 lawyers randomly sampled from the California Lawyers Association and D.C. Bar to address this knowledge gap. Findings indicated that the prevalence and severity of depression, anxiety, stress, and risky/hazardous drinking were significantly higher among women. Further, one-quarter of all women contemplated leaving the profession due to mental health concerns, compared to 17% of men. Logistic models were conducted to identify workplace factors predictive of stress, risky drinking, and contemplating leaving the profession. Overcommitment and permissiveness toward alcohol at work were associated with the highest likelihood of stress and risky drinking (relative to all other predictors) for both men and women. However, women and men differed with respect to predictors of leaving the profession due to stress or mental health. For women, work-family conflict was associated with the highest likelihood of leaving, while overcommitment was the number one predictor of leaving for men.

We propose that this is due to a local vascular problem because of activation of bradykinin 1 receptor (B1R) and B2R on endothelial cells in the lungs. SARS-CoV-2 enters the cell via ACE2 that next to its role in RAAS is needed to inactivate des-Arg9 bradykinin, the potent ligand of the B1R. Without ACE2 acting as a guardian to inactivate the ligands of B1R, the lung environment is prone for local vascular leakage leading to angioedema. Here, we hypothesize that a kinin-dependent local lung angioedema via B1R and eventually B2R is an important feature of COVID-19. We propose that blocking the B2R and inhibiting plasma kallikrein activity might have an ameliorating effect on early disease caused by COVID-19 and might prevent acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In addition, this pathway might indirectly be responsive to anti-inflammatory agents.","van de Veerdonk, Frank L; Netea, Mihai G; van Deuren, Marcel; van der Meer, Jos WM; de Mast, Quirijn; Brüggemann, Roger J; van der Hoeven, Hans",eLife,47,1

It posed a significant impact on different health services, including dermatology. Methods and objectives: Two online surveys were conducted to determine the prevalence of personal protective equipment-related skin complications (200 healthcare providers were included) and to demonstrate the outbreak s impact on dermatology practice (100 dermatologists were included). Results: In the first survey, the response rate was 72.46%. PPE- related dermatoses were reported by 147 (73%) participants, including frictional dermatitis (51.9%), mechanical acne (33.1%), contact dermatitis (29.9%), nonspecific rash (17.5%), urticaria (9.1%) and skin infections (3.2%). The response rate of the second survey was 64%. COVID-19 emerging cutaneous manifestations were recognized by 20% of dermatologists, including maculopapular rash (41.67%), urticaria (37.50%), chilblain (25%) and vasculitis (16.67). Telemedicine was provided by 73% of the dermatologists. The relapse rates of psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, rosacea, vitiligo and alopecia areata were noticeably increased as observed by 62%, 50%, 20%, and 4% of dermatologists, respectively. Most dermatologists (89%) reported minimal use of immunosuppressive drugs amid the pandemic. Conclusions: This article highlights the pivotal role of dermatologists in the leading edge during the current health crisis and how they adapt to these unfamiliar circumstances to meet the challenges. It documents the emergence of PPE-related dermatoses among healthcare providers and the impact of COVID-19 on different aspects of dermatology practice.","Shanshal, M.; Ahmed, H.

We aimed to compare the outcomes and severity of pulmonary involvement in patients with and without diabetes. Methods In this cohort study, patients with diabetes, hospitalized due to COVID-19 from February 2020 to May 2020 were recruited. Hospitalized individuals without diabetes were enrolled as control subjects. All patients were followed for 90 days, and clinical findings and patients’ outcomes were reported. Results Over a period of four months, 127 patients with diabetes and 127 individuals without diabetes with a diagnosis of COVID-19 were recruited. The mean age was 65.70±12.51 years. Mortality was higher in population with diabetes (22.8% vs. 15.0%; P=0.109), although not significantly. More severe pulmonary involvement (P=0.015), extended hospital stay (P<0.001), and higher need for invasive ventilation (P=0.029) were reported in this population. Stepwise logistic regression revealed that diabetes was not independently associated with mortality (p=0.092). Older age (OR=1.054, p=0.003), aggravated pulmonary involvement on admission (OR=1.149, p=0.001), presence of comorbidities (OR=1.290, p=0.020) and hypothyroidism (OR=6.576, p=0.021) were associated with mortality. Diabetic foot infection had a strong positive correlation (OR=49.819, p=0.016), whereas insulin therapy had a negative correlation (OR=0.242, p=0.045) with mortality. Conclusions The mortality rate due to COVID-19 did not differ significantly between patients with or without diabetes. Older age, macrovascular complications, and the presence of comorbidities could increase mortality in people with diabetes. Insulin therapy during hospitalization could attenuate the detrimental effects of hyperglycemia and improve prognosis of patients with COVID-19 and diabetes.","Khalili, Shayesteh; Moradi, Omid; Kharazmi, Amir Behnam; Raoufi, Masoomeh; Sistanizad, Mohammad; Shariat, Masoud",Can J Diabetes,47,0

The tracer gas emitted from the single source location represented the potentially infectious aerosol droplets emitted from a single student and was thus a way to examine the influence of one sick student on the rest of the class. Two parameters were adjusted during the testing—the spacing of the desks, which included a spread and compressed configuration, and the inclusion of three-sided clear dividers attached to the student desk surfaces. Tracer dispersion was measured through the use of monitors in 13 locations within the classroom, with eight monitors representing seated student locations, four monitors representing a standing instructor along the classroom front, and one monitor at the return vent in the ceiling. As expected, spacing strongly influenced concentration levels at desks adjacent to the source location. The use of dividers reduced overall student and instructor location tracer concentrations when compared to desks without dividers in most cases. Finally, the influence of air change differences on the results was noted with consistent trends. The experimental construct provides a systematic means for classroom testing that may be broadly applicable to various configurations of classrooms beyond the one tested.

However, their therapeutic potency still shows a gap between preclinical and clinical settings, and distinctive characteristics of specific tissue-derived MSCs and definitive ways to maximize their beneficial functions have not been fully elucidated yet. We previously identified the unique MSCs population from human palatine tonsil (TMSCs) and revealed their superior properties in proliferation and ROS regulation. Based on these findings, we explored further characteristics of TMSCs particularly focused on immunomodulatory function. We found the merit of TMSCs as a therapeutic agent that retains favorable MSCs properties until relatively late passages and revealed that pre-treatment of TNF-α can enhance the immunomodulatory abilities of TMSCs through the upregulation of the PTGS2/PGE(2) axis. TMSCs primed with TNF-α effectively restrained the proliferation and differentiation of T lymphocytes and macrophages in vitro, and more interestingly, these TNF-α-licensed TMSCs exhibited significant prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in a murine model of autoimmune-mediated acute colitis via clinical and histopathological assessment compared to unprimed naïve TMSCs. These findings provide novel insight into the optimization and standardization of MSCs-based anti-inflammatory therapies, especially targeting inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).","Shin, Tae-Hoon; Ahn, Ji-Su; Oh, Su-Jeong; Shin, Ye Young; Yang, Ji Won; Kang, Min-Jung; Kim, Ji Min; Lee, Byung-Joo; Seo, Yoojin; Kim, Hyung-Sik",Biomedicines,47,26

The objectives of this study were to determine the barriers and supports to implementing MDI/spacer research and to identify factors associated with early and late adoption of MDI/spacers in Canadian PEDs. METHODS: Using a comparative case study design, we classified nine tertiary care pediatric hospital PEDs based on their stage of implementation. Data were collected using focus group interviews with physicians, registered nurses (RNs), and respiratory therapists (RTs), and individual interviews with both patient care and medical directors at each site. Initial coding was based on the Ottawa Model of Research Use (OMRU) categories of elements known to influence the uptake of innovations. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty healthcare professionals from nine different healthcare institutions participated in this study. Lack of leadership in the form of a research champion, a lack of consensus about the benefits of MDI/spacers among staff, perceived resistance from patients/parents, and perceived increased cost and workload associated with MDI/spacer use were the most prevalent barriers to the adoption of the MDI/spacer. Common strategies used by early-adopting sites included the active participation of all professional groups in the adoption process in addition to a well-planned and executed educational component for staff, patients, and families. Early adopter sites were also more likely to have the MDI/spacer included in a clinical protocol/pathway. CONCLUSION: Potential barriers and supports to implementation have been identified that will help EDs adopt MDI/spacer use. Future interventions intended to increase MDI/spacer use in PEDs will need to be sensitive to the barriers identified in this study.","Scott, Shannon D; Osmond, Martin H; O'Leary, Kathy A; Graham, Ian D; Grimshaw, Jeremy; Klassen, Terry",Implement Sci,47,26

We aimed to study the clinical presentation, management, and outcome of patients who had abdominal tuberculosis and were treated at Al-Ain Hospital, Al-Ain City, United Arab Emirates. METHODS: All patients who had abdominal tuberculosis and were treated at Al-Ain Hospital between January 2011 and December 2018 were studied. Data were collected retrospectively using a structured protocol including demography, clinical presentation, diagnostic methods, management, and outcome. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients having a median age of 30 years were studied with an incidence of 0.6/100,000 population. The most common symptoms were abdominal pain (95.8%) and malaise (79.2%). Fever was present only in nine patients (37.5%). Laboratory investigations, except for polymerase chain reaction immunoassay, were not helpful. Chest X-ray was abnormal in three patients (12.5%). Ultrasound and abdominal CT scan were non-specific. Thirteen patients needed surgical intervention for diagnosis or therapy. Diagnosis was confirmed by histopathology in 15 patients (62.5%), immunological assays in 7 patients (29.2%), microbiological culture in 1 patient (4%), and therapeutic trial in 1 patient (4%). The most common type of abdominal tuberculosis was gastrointestinal in 13 patients (54.2%) followed by free wet peritonitis in 5 patients (20.8%). All patients had quadruple anti-tuberculous therapy for a minimum of 6 months. The median hospital stay was 6.5 days. None of our patients died.

It has been hypothesized that these drugs might increase the risk of severe Covid-19, but some authors suggested that blocking the renin-angiotensin system might actually decrease this risk. Methods Retrospective cohort study of all the consecutive hypertensive patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in a health area. The outcome variable was hospitalization because of severe Covid-19. Results 539 subjects were diagnosed of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of these, 157 (29.1%) had hypertension and were included in the study. Sixty-nine cases (43.9%) were hospitalized because of severe Covid-19. In multivariable analysis older age, diabetes and hypertensive myocadiopathy were related to a higher risk of hospital admission. ARB treatment was associated with a significantly lower risk of hospitalization (HR: 0.29, 95% CI: 0.10 – 0.88). A similar albeit not significant trend was observed for ACEI. Conclusion ARB or ACEI treatment was not associated with a worse clinical outcome in consecutive hypertensive patients infected by SARS-CoV-2.","Golpe, Rafael; Pérez-de-Llano, Luis A; Dacal, David; Guerrero-Sande, Hector; Pombo-Vide, Beatriz; Ventura-Valcárcel, Pablo",Med Clin (Barc),47,11

Individuals who are symptomatic/asymptomatic or have recovered are reported to have/will have serious health complications in the future, which is going to be huge economic burden globally. Given the wide-spread transmission of SARS-CoV-2 it is almost impossible to test each and every individual for the same and isolate them. Recent reports have shown that sewage can be used as a holistic approach to estimate the epidemiology of the virus. Here we have estimated the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the city of Hyderabad, India which is populated with nearly 10 million people. The sewage samples were collected from all the major sewage treatment plants (STPs) and were processed for detecting the viral genome using the standard RT-PCR method. Based on the average viral particle shedding per individual, the total number of individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 (in a window of 35 days) is about 6.6% of the population, which clearly indicates the rate of community transmission and asymptomatic carriers is higher than the number of reported cases. It is important to note here that the samples collected from the inlet of STPs were positive for SARS-CoV-2, while the outlets were negative indicating the efficient treatment of sewage at STPs. These studies are going to be essential to manage the pandemic better and also to assess the effectiveness of control measure.","Manupati, H.; Kiran, U.; Kuncha, S. K.; Kopperi, H.; C.G., G.; S., V.

This study describes the willingness to be vaccinated for H1N1 among healthcare workers (HCWs) in primary healthcare clinics with and without chronic medical conditions, their reasons for refusing vaccination and whether they sought additional information to make an informed decision for the vaccination. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An anonymous survey was conducted in November 2009 among all medical, nursing, allied health and operations HCWs in nine primary care clinics in Singapore. Participants were asked if they had any chronic medical conditions associated with influenza-related complications (example: asthma, stroke, heart disease, cancer, diabetes mellitus, renal disease), their perception towards vaccination for H1N1 and against seasonal influenza within the preceding 2 years. RESULTS: The initial response rate was 80%, of which 711 (54.7%) of the completed surveys were analysed. Among the 711 respondents, 16.6% reported having at least 1 chronic disease. Asthma (10.8%), hypertension (10.4%) and dyslipidaemia (9.8%) were the main chronic conditions. Only 39.4% of respondents were willing to be vaccinated against H1N1. Males were 2.07 (95% CI 1.19–3.62) times more likely than females to receive the H1N1 vaccination; the 45–54 and 55+ years old were 2.12 (95% CI 1.06–4.24) and 2.44 (95% CI 1.13–5.27) times more willing than those below 25 years old; and those who considered accepting the seasonal influenza vaccine were 7.0 times more likely than those who did not (95%CI 4.48–10.92). The 2 principal barriers were “fear of side effects” and “unsure of vaccine's effectiveness”. Although 78% attended some H1N1-related talks, only 7% of all HCWs felt that they had sufficient information. Most wanted more information about the vaccine's safety profile and contraindications. CONCLUSION: Fewer than 40% of HCWs expressed willingness to receive the H1N1 vaccination, lower than past rates of influenza vaccine. HCWs in primary care clinics who had a chronic condition did not perceive themselves to be at higher risk of developing H1N1-related complications and were not more willing than the rest of the HCWs to accept H1N1 vaccination. Vaccine's side effects and effectiveness were the main concerns. Uptake of H1N1 vaccine may improve with targeted health information covering the vaccine's safety profile.","Toh, Matthias Paul Han Sim; Kannan, Predeebha; Chen, Yongchang; Chng, Florence Liong Cheu; Tang, Wern Ee",Vaccine,47,3

The targeted release of drugs remains a subject of research interest. Moreover, it is important to explore the properties of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) inulin esters because they are less studied. Additionally, HMI has been used to stabilize various dispersion formulations, which have been observed to be safe because inulin is generally recognized as safe (GRAS). However, the results regarding HMI-based dispersion products are dispersed throughout the literature. This comprehensive review is discussed the possible limitations regarding SCFAs inulin esters, real food dispersion formulations, and HMI drugs. The results revealed that SCFAs inulin esters can regulate the human gut microbiota and increase the biological half-life of SCFAs in the human body.

However, the industry in Ghana is yet to take off due to policy uncertainty and regulatory costs. The paper analyzed the key determinants and how they interact to impact the scaling up of wind energy in Ghana, using time series data, the vector auto regression (VAR) model from 2013 to 2019.There were four endogenous variables, grouped under policy, population growth, wind capacity, and electrification rate. The findings revealed the dynamic behavior of the variables from the VAR to a strongly significant positive correlation to deploying wind energy in Ghana. The impulse response functions (IRFs) equally exhibited a positive impact long-run trajectory growth of the variables after a shock to the system. The response of the first lags had differences of log policy and that of the log of GDP produced a curious result from the shock by taking a steady positive growth path in the short run and nosedived to a negative pathway in the long run. On the other hand, the interaction of the first differences of the lags of log wind capacity and log policy is quite instructive, as the headwind produced a negative relationship in the short run and to a positive growth path in the long run. This was anticipated, as the wind capacity installation of Ghana is expected to increase in the long run, when pipeline projects materialize.","Sun, Huaping; Khan, Abdul Razzaq; Bashir, Ahmed; Alemzero, David Ajene; Abbas, Qaiser; Abudu, Hermas",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,47,20

We collected the time series data of the cumulative number of confirmed infected, dead, and cured cases from the health commissions in 31 provinces in mainland China. A descriptive model in a logistic form was formulated to infer the intrinsic epidemic rules of COVID-19, which illustrates robustness spatially and temporally. Our model is robust (R2>0.95) to depict the intrinsic growth rule for the cumulative number of confirmed infected, dead, and cured cases in 31 provinces in mainland China. Furthermore, we compared the intrinsic epidemic rules of COVID-19 in Hubei with that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Beijing, which was obtained from the Ministry of Public Health of China in 2003. We found that the infected case is the earliest to be saturated and has the lowest semi-saturation period compared with deaths and cured cases for both COVID-19 and SARS. All the three types of SARS cases are later to saturate and have longer semi-saturation period than that of COVID-19. Despite the virus caused SARS (SARS-CoV) and the virus caused COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) are homologous, the duration of the outbreak would be shorter for COVID-19.","Han, Chuanliang; Liu, Yimeng; Yang, Saini",,47,9

The country is currently plagued by a huge burden of virusrelated cases and deaths. So far, the disease has highlighted a number of problems, some in common with other Countries and others peculiar to Italy which has suffered from a mortality rate higher than that observed in China and in most Countries in the world. The causes must be sought not only in the average age of the population (one of the oldest in the world), but also in the inconsistencies of the regional health systems (into which the National Health System is divided) and their delayed response, at least in some areas. Ethical issues emerged from the beginning, ranging from restrictions on freedom of movements and restrictions on personal privacy due to the lockdown, further to the dilemma for healthcare professionals to select people for ICU hospitalization in a shortage of beds in Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Organizational problems also emerged, although an official 2007 document from the Ministry of Health had planned not only what measures had to be taken during an epidemic caused by respiratory viruses, but also what had to be done in the inter-epidemic period (including the establishment of DPIs stocks and ventilators), vast areas of Italy were totally unprepared to cope with the disease, as a line of that document was not implemented. Since organizational problems can worsen (and even cause) ethical dilemmas, every effort should be made in the near future to prepare the health system to respond to a similar emergency in a joint, coherent, and homogeneous way across the Country, as planned in the 2007 document. In this perspective, Pulmonary Units and specialists can play a fundamental role in coping with the disease not only in hospitals, as intermediate care units, but also at a territorial level in an integrated network with GPs.","Nardini, Stefano; Sanguinetti, Claudio M.; De Benedetto, Fernando; Baccarani, Claudio; Del Donno, Mario; Polverino, Mario; Annesi-Maesano, Isabella",Multidiscip Respir Med,47,5

As dry air flows over SoCal’s coastal ranges on its way from the elevated Great Basin down to sea level, all SAWs warm adiabatically. Many but not all SAWs produce coastal heat events. The strongest regionally averaged SAWs tend to be cold. In fact, some of the hottest and coldest observed temperatures in coastal SoCal are linked to SAWs. We show that hot and cold SAWs are produced by distinct synoptic dynamics. High-amplitude anticyclonic flow around a blocking high pressure aloft anchored at the California coast produces hot SAWs. Cold SAWs result from anticyclonic Rossby wave breaking over the northwestern U.S. Hot SAWs are preceded by warming in the Great Basin and dry conditions across the Southwestern U.S. Precipitation over the Southwest, including SoCal, and snow accumulation in the Great Basin usually precede cold SAWs. Both SAW flavors, but especially the hot SAWs, yield low relative humidity at the coast. Although cold SAWs tend to be associated with the strongest winds, hot SAWs tend to last longer and preferentially favor wildfire growth. Historically, out of large (> 100 acres) SAW-spread wildfires, 90% were associated with hot SAWs, accounting for 95% of burned area. As health impacts of SAW-driven coastal fall, winter and spring heat waves and impacts of smoke from wildfires have been recently identified, our results have implications for designing early warning systems. The long-term warming trend in coastal temperatures associated with SAWs is focused on January–March, when hot and cold SAW frequency and temperature intensity have been increasing and decreasing, respectively, over our 71-year record.

METHODS: A total of 2321 eligible patients were included in this study from February 4 to April 15, 2020. Two illness conditions, including mild/moderate (M/M) subtype to severe/critical (S/C) and S/C to fatality, were classified. Clinical message was collected and compared, respectively. Kaplan–Meier method, Cox regression model and risk score system were used to predict disease progression in S/C COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 112 of 1761 patients with M/M subtype were progressors (P) and 1649 non-progressors (NP). Increasing disease progression associated with higher levels of neutrophils count (HR=1.958, 95% CI=1.253–3.059, P=0.003), CK (HR=2.203, 95% CI=1.048–4.632, P=0.037), LDH (HR=3.309, 95% CI=2.083–5.256, P<0.001) and CRP (HR=2.575, 95% CI=1.638–4.049, P<0.001), and lower level of lymphocytes count (HR=1.549, 95% CI=1.018–2.355, P=0.041), as well as total lesion volume ratio greater than ≥10% (HR=2.286, 95% CI=1.451–3.601, P<0.001) on admission. In progression to fatality, 56 of the 672 S/C cases died and 616 survived. Increasing fatality associated with lower level of lymphocytes count (HR:2.060, 95% CI:1.000–4.242, P=0.050), higher levels of BUN (HR:2.715, 95% CI:1.539–4.790, P<0.001), CK-MB (HR:3.412, 95% CI:1.760–6.616, P<0.001), LDH (HR:5.578, 95% CI:2.317–13.427, P<0.001), and PT (HR:3.619, 95% CI:2.102–6.231, P<0.001). Furthermore, high risk of neutrophils count, lymphocytes count, CK, LDH, CRP, and total lesion volume ratio was powerfully correlated with the incidence of progression to S/C in patients with NS COVID-19 and high odds of lymphocytes count, BUN, CK-MB, LDH, and PT were significantly associated with death in patients with S/C COVID-19. In addition, the progression and mortality rates increased with increasing risk scores. CONCLUSION: Elevated LDH level and lymphopenia were independent predictors for COVID-19 sustainable management in classifying non-severe patients who progressed to severe condition and identifying S/C patients who deteriorated to fatal outcomes as well. Total lesion volume ratio ≥10% may provide early predictive evidence with COVID-19 patients at high risk of developing into S/C to improve prognosis.","Liu, Miaomiao; Jiang, Hua; Li, Yujuan; Li, Chunmei; Tan, Zhijun; Jin, Faguang; Zhang, Tao; Nan, Yandong",Int J Gen Med,47,22

Millions have succumbed globally to the disease, and the numbers are increasing day by day. The viral genome enters into the human host through interaction between the spike protein (S) and host angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) proteins. S is the common target for most recently rolled-out vaccines across regions. A recent surge in single/multiple mutations in S region is of great concern as it may escape vaccine induced immunity. So far, the treatment regime with repurposed drugs has not been too successful. HYPOTHESIS: Natural compounds are capable of targeting mutated spike protein by binding to its active site and destabilizing the spike-host ACE2 interaction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A hypothetical mutated spike protein was constructed by incorporating twelve different mutations from twelve geographical locations simultaneously into the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and docked with ACE2 and seven phytochemicals namely allicin, capsaicin, cinnamaldehyde, curcumin, gingerol, piperine and zingeberene. Molecular Dynamic (MD) simulation and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were finally used for validation of the docking results. RESULT: The docking results showed that curcumin and piperine were most potent to bind ACE2, mutated spike, and mutated spike-ACE2 complex, thereby restricting viral entry. ADME analysis also proved their drug candidature. The docking complexes were found to be stable by MD simulation. CONCLUSION: This result provides a significant insight about the phytochemicals' role, namely curcumin and piperine, as the potential therapeutic entities against mutated spike protein of SARS-CoV-2.","Nag, Anish; Paul, Subhabrata; Banerjee, Ritesh; Kundu, Rita",Comput Biol Med,47,28

We aimed at identifying homologous peptide sequences by means of two distinct complementary bioinformatics approaches. Pipeline 1 included prediction of MHC Class I and Class II epitopes contained in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome and allergens along with alignment and elaborate ranking approaches. Pipeline 2 involved alignment of SARS-CoV-2 overlapping peptides with known allergen-derived T cell epitopes. Our results indicate a large number of MHC Class I epitope pairs including known as well as de novo predicted allergen T cell epitopes with high probability for cross-reactivity. Allergen sources, such as Aspergillus fumigatus, Phleum pratense and Dermatophagoides species are of particular interest due to their association with multiple cross-reactive candidate peptides, independently of the applied bioinformatic approach. In contrast, peptides derived from food allergens, as well as MHC class II epitopes did not achieve high in silico ranking and were therefore not further investigated. Our findings warrant further experimental confirmation along with examination of the functional importance of such cross-reactive responses.","Balz, Kathrin; Kaushik, Abhinav; Chen, Meng; Cemic, Franz; Heger, Vanessa; Renz, Harald; Nadeau, Kari; Skevaki, Chrysanthi",Sci Rep,47,3

This is particularly true in terms of transport and of protein sorting. For example, the question how cargo proteins are transported through this organelle is still a matter of debate. Emphasis has been put on the role of anterograde and retrograde transport vesicles. These have been proposed to carry cargo from cisterna to cisterna and to recycle components needed for further rounds of transport. Alternatively, anterograde movement of cargo takes place in cisternal membranes rather than transport vesicles. These membranes assemble and mature in a cis to trans direction. In this case, retrograde transport vesicles need to recycle all components of the Golgi apparatus and this demands a highly dynamic and efficient sorting machinery. Here we will discuss possible mechanisms for protein sorting in the context of cisternal maturation and propose that a common mechanism is sufficient to explain both transport of cargo and sorting of resident proteins.","Füllekrug, Joachim; Nilsson, Tommy",Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Cell Res,47,20

OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to investigate acceptance and preferences related to the use of telerheumatology care among German rheumatologists and general practitioners. METHODS: A nationwide, cross-sectional, self-completed, paper-based survey on telerheumatology care was conducted among outpatient rheumatologists and general practitioners during the pre-COVID-19 period. RESULTS: A total of 73.3% (349/476) of survey participants rated their knowledge of telemedicine as unsatisfactory, poor, or very poor. The majority of survey participants (358/480, 74.6%) answered that they do not currently use telemedicine, although 62.3% (291/467) would like to.

Among treatment phases, 64.4% (291/452) of participants would choose to use telemedicine during follow-up. Half of the participants would choose telecounseling as a specific approach to improve rheumatology care (91/170, 53.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Before COVID-19 appeared, our results indicated generally low use but high acceptance of the implementation of telerheumatology among physicians. Participants indicated that the lack of a structural framework was a barrier to the effective implementation of telerheumatology. Training courses should be introduced to address the limited knowledge on the part of physicians in the use of telemedicine. More research into telerheumatology is required. This includes large-scale randomized controlled trials, economic analyses, and the exploration of user preferences.","Muehlensiepen, Felix; Knitza, Johannes; Marquardt, Wenke; Engler, Jennifer; Hueber, Axel; Welcker, Martin",J Med Internet Res,47,10

METHODS: Patients, aged 0 years to 18 years, who presented to our clinic between 21 March 2020 and 31 May 2020 (during curfew) (Group A1, n = 111), between 01 June 2020 and 31 August 2020 (Group A2, n = 214) and during the same periods in 2019 Group B1 (n = 220) and Group B2 (n = 211) were included. Patients with pathological fractures, traumas occurring earlier than the aforementioned date range and those consulted while being hospitalized in another department were excluded from study. Patients’ demographics, the department they presented to, the anatomical region affected by trauma, trauma mechanism, the location of trauma, the treatment applied and the length of hospital stay were recorded. RESULTS: The prevalence of outdoor traumas (72.9% versus 61.1%), high-energy traumas (40.1% versus 26.5%), the rate of the patients treated with surgery (28% versus 17.1%) and the rate of admission to the emergency department (90.2% versus 58.3%) were significantly higher in Group A2 when compared with Group B2 (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The significant increase was observed in the number of outdoor injuries, high-energy traumas and fracture patterns that require surgical treatment during the first three months following the lift of the curfew, in comparison with the corresponding dates from last year.

One reason for this could be the lack of knowledge regarding preventive measures against COVID-19 and the inability of the psychiatric patients to discern misinformation from facts. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study design was cross-sectional. We applied one questionnaire that evaluated knowledge of prevention measures and information about COVID-19 (comprised of two sections, each with five questions). The first section evaluated knowledge regarding the official WHO prevention measures against COVID-19, and the second consisted of false information about COVID-19 which examined the ability to identify misinformation about COVID-19. These questionnaires were applied face-to-face to psychiatric male inpatients from a tertiary psychiatric hospital in Bucharest diagnosed with SMI or severe alcohol disorder (SAUD) and to male controls from the community, matched by age and education. Mean scores of patients and controls were compared using Mann–Whitney test. RESULTS: There were 115 male psychiatric patients in total (65 SMI and 50 SAUD) and 57 controls included after the matching procedure. We found statistically significant lower (P<0.05) scores for psychiatric patients compared to controls regarding the prevention and general knowledge of COVID-19 (P<0.001), the WHO information about prevention measures (P=0.041), and the ability to identify misinformation about COVID-19 (P<0.001). The fact that psychiatric patients have less knowledge about prevention measures against COVID-19 and a reduced capacity to discern misinformation suggests that we need to identify new methods to convey correct information to these patients and also to better equip them to handle misinformation regarding COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Patients with SMI and SAUD are less informed regarding COVID-19 infection and preventive measures compared to controls, while being prone to believing false information about COVID-19 as well.","Matei, Valentin; Pavel, Alexandru; Giurgiuca, Ana; Roșca, Alina; Sofia, Arina; Duțu, Irina; Tudose, Cătălina",Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat,47,20

Conventional medications have limited effects, which makes focus shifted to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Tong-Xie-Yao-Fang, as a classic herbal formula in TCM, is pretty effective and safe for the treatment of diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D), but the underlying therapeutic mechanism remains unknown. We aim to verify the efficacy and safety of TXYF granule (the formula particles mixed together) in IBS-D and elucidate the gene-level mechanism of IBS-D and therapeutic targets of TXYF granule based on whole transcriptome analysis. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled clinical trial consisting of 2 weeks of run-in period, 12 weeks of treatment period, and 8 weeks of follow-up period. We will enroll 120 participants with IBS-D, who will be randomly assigned to the TXYF granule group and the placebo group, and recruit additional 10 healthy individuals as controls for mechanistic outcome. The two groups respectively take TXYF granule or placebo orally for treatment. The primary outcome is the response rate of IBS-Symptom Severity Score (IBS-SSS). The secondary outcomes include adequate relief (AR), IBS-Quality of Life Questionnaire (IBS-QOL), and long-term efficacy. Mechanistic outcome is the whole transcriptome profiling of the intestinal mucosae from IBS participants before and after the treatment and healthy individuals. DISCUSSION: This trial will prove the effectiveness and safety of TXYF granule with high-quality evidence and provide a penetrating and comprehensive perspective on the molecular mechanism of IBS-D by whole transcriptome analysis, which makes us pinpoint specific biomarkers of IBS-D and therapeutic targets of TXYF.

We performed a web search of COVID-19 vaccination policies for pregnant women under two categories: countries bearing a high burden of COVID-19 cases and countries with a high burden of maternal and under-five mortality. Of the top 20 countries affected by COVID-19, 11 allow vaccination of pregnant women, of which two have deemed it safe to vaccinate pregnant women as a high-risk group. In contrast, only five of the 20 countries with high under-five mortality and maternal mortality allow vaccination of pregnant women and none of these countries has included them as part of a high-risk group that should be vaccinated. India and Indonesia, with one-fifth of the world's population, fall under both categories but do not include pregnant women as a priority group for COVID-19 vaccination. To prevent COVID-19 from further aggravating the already heavy burden of maternal and under-five mortality, there is a strong case for including pregnant women as a high-priority group for COVID-19 vaccination. We recommend including COVID-19 vaccination in routine antenatal care in all countries, particularly India and Indonesia in view of their high dual burden.","Sarwal, Yamini; Sarwal, Tanvi; Sarwal, Rakesh",Int. j. gynaecol. obstet,47,20

Provider in triage (PIT) programs—which typically involve, at a minimum, a physician or advanced practice provider conducting an initial screening exam and potentially initiating treatment and diagnostic testing at the time of triage—are frequently endorsed as a mechanism to reduce ED length of stay (LOS) and therefore mitigate crowding, improve patient satisfaction, and improve ED operational and financial performance. However, the peer‐reviewed evidence regarding the impact of PIT programs on measures including ED LOS, wait times, and costs (as variously defined) is mixed. Mechanistically, PIT programs exert their effects by initiating diagnostic work‐ups earlier and, sometimes, by equipping triage providers to directly disposition patients. However, depending on local contextual factors—including the co‐existence of other front‐end interventions and delays in ED throughput not addressed by PIT—we demonstrate how these features may or may not ultimately translate into reduced ED LOS in different settings. Consequently, site‐specific analysis of the root causes of excessive ED LOS, along with mechanistic assessment of potential countermeasures, is essential for appropriate deployment and successful design of PIT programs at individual EDs. Additional motivations for implementing PIT programs may include their potential to enhance patient safety, patient satisfaction, and team dynamics. In this conceptual article, we address a gap in the literature by demonstrating the mechanisms underlying PIT program results and providing a framework for ED decision‐makers to assess the local rationale for, operational feasibility of, and financial impact of PIT programs.","Franklin, Brian J.; Li, Kathleen Y.; Somand, David M.; Kocher, Keith E.; Kronick, Steven L.; Parekh, Vikas I.; Goralnick, Eric; Nix, A.

A survey was administered to gather participants’ perspectives on the needs in pediatric planning, as well as important elements of their organizations’ and regions’ pandemic plans. A thematic analysis was conducted on qualitative survey responses. RESULTS: The majority of existing plans did not adequately address the unique needs of pediatric populations, and mainly focused on medical and policy concerns. Several gaps in plans were identified, including the need for psychosocial supports and ethical decision-making frameworks for children and families. Similarly, survey respondents identified parallel gaps, in their organization's or region's plans. CONCLUSIONS: Although many plans provide guidelines for medical and policy issues in pediatrics, much more work remains in psychosocial and ethical planning. A focus on children and families is needed for pandemic planning in pediatrics to ensure best outcomes for children and families.","Nicholas, David; Patershuk, Clare; Koller, Donna; Bruce-Barrett, Cindy; Lach, Lucy; Zlotnik Shaul, Randi; Matlow, Anne",Health Policy,47,33

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective study in patients undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopy in urology or gynaecology within two academic hospitals. Patients underwent local preoperative COVID-19 screening using a symptoms questionnaire. Patients with suspicious screening underwent coronavirus RT-PCR and were excluded from robotic surgery if positive. Patients with symptoms post-surgery were systematically tested for coronavirus by RT-PCR. One month post-surgery, all patients had a telephone consultation to evaluate COVID-19 symptoms. RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients underwent robotic surgery during the study period (median age: 63-years [IQR: 53-70], 1.8 male: female ratio). Oncology was the main indication for robotic surgery (n=62, 91.2%) and 26 patients (38.2%) received a chest CT-scan prior to surgery. Eleven patients (16.2%) were symptomatic after surgery of whom only one tested positive for coronavirus by RT-PCR (1.5%) and was transferred to COVID-19 unit with no life-threatening condition. No attending surgeon was diagnosed with COVID-19 during the study. CONCLUSIONS: Robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery seemed safe in the era of COVID-19 as long as all recommended precautions are followed. The rate of nosocomial COVID-19 transmission was extremely low despite the fact that we only used RT-PCR testing in symptomatic patients during the preoperative work-up.

This paper starts with a review of the COVID-19 outbreak in Israel, Palestine and Jordan, in the context of the regional health systems, demography and politics. We suggest that Israel and Palestine function as one epidemiological unit, due to extensive border crossing of inhabitants and tourists, resulting in cross-border infections and potential for outbreaks' transmission. Indeed, there is a correlation between the numbers of confirmed cases with a 2–3 weeks lag. In contrast, Jordan has the ability to seal its borders and better contain the spread of the virus. We then discuss comparative public health aspects in relation to the management of COVID-19 and long term adaptation to climate change. We suggest that lessons from the current crisis can inform regional adaptation to climate change. There is an urgent need for better health surveillance, data sharing across borders, and more resilient health systems that are prepared and equipped for emergencies. Another essential and currently missing prerequisite is close cooperation within and across countries amidst political conflict, in order to protect the public health of all inhabitants of the region.","Negev, Maya; Dahdal, Yara; Khreis, Haneen; Hochman, Assaf; Shaheen, Mohammed; Jaghbir, Madi T.A.; Alpert, Pinhas; Levine, Hagai; Davidovitch, Nadav",Sci Total Environ,47,15

In the initial events, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia implemented mandatory quarantine of returning travelers in order to contain COVID-19 cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a longitudinal study of the arriving travelers to Quarantine facilities and the prevalence of positive SARS-CoV-2 as detected by RT-PCR. RESULTS: During the study period, there was a total of 1928 returning travelers with 1273 (66%) males. The age range was 28 days–69 years. Of all the travelers, 23 (1.2%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of the first swab, 14/1928 (0.7%) tested positive. The positivity rate was 0.63% and 0.92% among males and females, respectively (P = 0.57). The second swab was positive in 9 (0.5%) of the other 1914 who were initially negative with a positivity rate of 0.39% and 0.62% among males and females, respectively (P = 0.49). There was no statistical difference in the positivity rates between first and second swab (P = 0.4).

Dromedary camels are the only known reservoir of the virus until now. They shed the virus in their body secretions thus potentiate a risk for human infection. MERS-CoV tropism and replication is mainly affected by the presence of certain receptor ligands on the target tissues. The dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) is believed to act as receptors for MERS-CoV. The main objective of this study was to determine the expression levels of the DPP-4 in various organs of some naturally infected camels. We conducted a surveillance study to identify some positive MERS-CoV infected camels. Three positive animals identified by the Real time PCR. Our results are clearly showing the high level of expression of the DPP-4 in various organs of these animals’ particularly nasal turbinate, trachea, and lungs. The expression level may explain at least in part the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV in these organs. These findings confirm the pivotal roles of the DPP4 in the context of the MER-CoV infection in dromedary camels.

SARS-CoV-2, as other coronaviruses, binds its target cells through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Accordingly, this makes ACE2 research essential for understanding the zoonotic nature of coronaviruses and identifying novel drugs. Here we present a systematic analysis of the ACE2 conservation and co-evolution protein network across 1671 eukaryotes, revealing an unexpected conservation pattern in specific metazoans, plants, fungi, and protists. We identified the co-evolved protein network and pinpointed a list of drugs that target this network by using data integration from different sources. Our computational analysis found widely used drugs such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and vasodilators. These drugs are expected to perturbate the ACE2 network affecting infectivity as well as the pathophysiology of the disease.","Braun, Maya; Sharon, Elad; Unterman, Irene; Miller, Maya; Shtern, Anna Mellul; Benenson, Shmuel; Vainstein, Alexander; Tabach, Yuval",iScience,47,16

The clinical presentation of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) resembles that of other etiologies of community-acquired pneumonia, making diagnosis difficult. Hematological and biochemical abnormalities, particularly lymphopenia, are common in patients with SARS. Methods. With the use of 2 databases, we compared the ability of the absolute lymphocyte count, absolute neutrophil count, lactate dehydrogenase level, creatine kinase level, alanine aminotransferase level, and serum calcium level at hospital admission to discriminate between cases of SARS and cases of community-acquired pneumonia. The SARS database contained data for 144 patients with SARS from the 2003 Toronto SARS outbreak. The community-acquired pneumonia database contained data for 8044 patients with community-acquired pneumonia from Edmonton, Canada. Patients from the SARS database were matched to patients from the community-acquired pneumonia database according to age, and receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed for each laboratory variable. Results. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) demonstrated fair to poor discriminatory ability for all laboratory variables tested except absolute neutrophil count, which had an AUC of 0.80, indicating good discriminatory ability (although there was no cutoff value of the absolute neutrophil count at which reasonable sensitivity or specificity could be obtained). Combinations of any 2 tests did not perform significantly better than did the absolute neutrophil count alone. Conclusions. Routine laboratory tests, including determination of absolute lymphocyte count, should not be used in the diagnosis of SARS or incorporated into current case definitions of SARS. The role of the absolute neutrophil count in SARS diagnosis is likely limited, but it should be assessed further.","Muller, Matthew P.; Tomlinson, George; Marrie, Thomas J.; Tang, Patrick; McGeer, Allison; Low, Donald E.; Detsky, Allan S.; Gold, Wayne L.",Clin Infect Dis,47,21

We conducted a structural characterization of mAbs against the N-terminal domain of nucleocapsid protein (NP(NTD)) from SARS-CoV-2 using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Our solution-based results distinguished the mAbs’ flexibility and how this flexibility impacts the assembly of multiple mAbs on an antigen. By pairing two mAbs that bind different epitopes on the NP(NTD), we show that flexible mAbs form a closed sandwich-like complex. With rigid mAbs, a juxtaposition of the Fabs is prevented, enforcing a linear arrangement of the mAb pair, which facilitates further mAb polymerization. In a modified sandwich ELISA, we show the rigid mAb-pairings with linear polymerization led to increased NP(NTD) detection sensitivity. These enhancements can expedite the development of more sensitive and selective antigen-detecting point-of-care lateral flow devices (LFA), key for early diagnosis and epidemiological studies of SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens.","Hodge, Curtis D.; Rosenberg, Daniel J.; Wilamowski, Mateusz; Joachimiak, Andrzej; Hura, Greg L.; Hammel, Michal",bioRxiv,47,20

Research Design and Methods: The 2020 China COVID-19 Survey was administered anonymously via social media (WeChat) across China. It was completed by 10,545 adults in all of mainland China's 31 provinces. The survey consisted of 74 items covering sociodemographic characteristics, preventive measures for COVID-19, lifestyle behaviors, and health-related outcomes during the period of quarantine. Regression models examined associations among study variables, adjusting for covariates. Results: Diabetes was associated with a six-fold increased risk of reporting COVID-19 infection among respondents or their family members. Among patients with diabetes, individuals who rarely wore masks had double the risk of suspected COVID-19 infection compared with those who always wore masks, with an inverse J-shaped relationship between face mask wearing and suspected COVID-19 infection. People with T2DM tended to have both poor knowledge of COVID-19 and poor compliance with preventive measures, despite perceiving a high risk of personal infection (40.0% among respondents reporting T2DM and 8.0% without T2DM). Only 54-55% of these respondents claimed to consistently practice preventive measures, including wearing face masks. Almost 60% of those with T2DM experienced food or medication shortages during the quarantine period, which was much higher than those without T2DM (22.7 % and 25.8%, respectively). Importantly, respondents who experienced medication shortages reported a 63% higher COVID-19 infection rate.

This virus infects cells in different tissues and causes pulmonary (e.g., pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome), neurological, cardiovascular, and intestinal manifestations, which can be the result of a direct viral effect or secondary to endothelial, thrombotic, or immunological alterations. In this chapter, we discuss recent studies which highlighted the relevance of the intestinal microbiota for other infectious respiratory diseases. We present the ""altered microbiota"" (dysbiotic) as a point of connection between conditions that are risk factors for the development of severe forms of COVID-19.

Community-Based Organizations (CBOs) in five states (California, Colorado, Oregon, Nevada, and Arizona) obtained feedback directly from patients with SCD on managing their care via telehealth during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Phone calls were made by CBOs in five states, to their specific patient database between May 11 - 29, 2020. A series of 17 questions were asked to obtain information from patients with SCD, parents of children with SCD, or caregivers of a person with SCD. All data was de-identified. CBOs that participated in data collection included the Sickle Cell Disease Foundation (California), Colorado Sickle Cell Association, Sickle Cell Anemia Foundation of Oregon, Sickled Not Broken Foundation of Nevada, and Sickle Cell Foundation of Arizona. Results: A total of 199 patients or caregivers of patients living with sickle cell disease were surveyed. Of these individuals, 121 (61%) were female and 78 (39%) were male. The most prevalent SCD hemoglobinopathy reported among patients was Hgb SS (68%) followed by Hgb SC disease at (20%). Hgb SB or other variants were surveyed at (9%), while (3%) were unknown. Participants with Hgb SS disease at (46%) were female while (22%) were male. Overall, the majority of patients fell within the age range of 18-35 (50%). Female patients were 18-35 yrs (30%), 0-17 yrs (18%) or > 36 yrs (13%). Male patients ranged from 18-35 years (20%), 0-17 yrs (12%), and 36 or older (7%). When surveying patients about their primary languages, the majority of participants spoke English (92%), while others spoke Spanish (5%), French (1%), Somali (1%), and Creole (1%). Individuals, who were not fluent in English, desired translated material to assist them in better understanding their disease and managing their care. To understand patient access to care via telehealth platforms during a global pandemic, we asked questions with the following themes: familiarity with telehealth services, the willingness or ability to access services and healthcare utilization patterns during COVID-19. Of those surveyed, 55% indicated that they have heard of or have participated in telehealth services. Importantly, 85% reported familiarity or the ability to download Zoom, and 80% reported interest in connecting with a provider via telehealth services. When asked about access to WiFi and to tools used to navigate online systems, the majority of patients indicated they had access to WiFi (95%) and would access telehealth services through any of the following devices: mobile phones (71%), computers (59%) or tablets (17%). Survey respondents also indicated they had assistance at home with accessing telehealth sessions (64%) while the remaining (46%) indicated that they would be interested in having a Community Health Worker provide them with support in getting started with telehealth services. When asking patients about health care utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic only 35% of patients indicated they went to an emergency room for care while the remaining 65% did not. Of note, 53% of those surveyed reported managing their SCD crisis at home, with 52% of all patients reporting that they reached out to SCD providers (hematologists with expertise in treating patients with sickle cell disease) for advice and care recommendations rather than risking exposure to COVID in the ER. In addition, patients indicated that they had difficulty getting prescriptions refilled or were unable to afford their medications (16%). Lastly, almost all patients indicated an interest in having access to a 24-hour hotline for SCD care (94%). Conclusion: The utilization of CBOs to provide ancillary support services is necessary to continue to understand patient needs, not only during a global crisis but after for routine health care. Our survey demonstrated that most patients have access to the technology needed to connect to their healthcare teams. However, access to a knowledgeable provider should be strengthened to ensure patient competence and comfort with self-management while utilizing telehealth resources. Finally, clinical care teams are recommended to enhance access to telehealth services and provide additional community resources to improve access to care.

Typically, these critical illness-associated microbleeds involve the juxtacortical white matter and corpus callosum. Recently, this pattern was reported in patients with respiratory failure, suffering from COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective single-center study, we listed patients from March 11, 2020 to September 2, 2020, with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, critical illness and cerebral microbleeds. Literature research was conducted through a methodical search on Pubmed databases on critical illness-associated microbleeds and cerebral microbleeds described in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: On 279 COVID-19 admissions, two cases of cerebral microbleeds were detected in critical ill patients with respiratory failure due to COVID-19. Based on review of existing literature critical illness-associated microbleeds tend to predominate in subcortical white matter and corpus callosum. Cerebral microbleeds in patients with COVID-19 tend to follow similar patterns as reported in critical illness-associated microbleeds. Hence, one patient with typical critical illness-associated microbleeds and COVID-19 is reported. However, a new pattern of widespread cortico-juxtacortical microbleeds, predominantly in the anterior vascular territory with relative sparing of deep gray matter, corpus callosum and infratentorial structures is documented in a second case. The possible etiologies of these microbleeds include hypoxia, hemorrhagic diathesis, brain endothelial erythrophagocytosis and/or cytokinopathies. An association with COVID-19 remains to be determined. CONCLUSION: Further systematic investigation of microbleed patterns in patients with neurological impairment and COVID-19 is necessary.","Toeback, Jonas; Depoortere, Sofie DR; Vermassen, Joris; Vereecke, Elke LH; Van Driessche, Veroniek; Hemelsoet, Dimitri M",Clin Neurol Neurosurg,47,1

To initiate the infective cycle, the viral genome must therefore translocate from the viral particle to the cytoplasm. Via distinct proteins or motifs in their outermost shell, the particles attach initially to specific molecules on the host cell surface. These virus receptors thus mediate penetration of the viral genome inside the cell, where the intracellular infective cycle starts. The presence of these receptors on the cell surface is a principal determinant of virus host tropism. Viruses can use diverse types of molecules to attach to and enter into cells. In addition, virus-receptor recognition can evolve over the course of an infection, and virus variants with distinct receptor-binding specificities and tropism can appear. The identification of virus receptors and the characterization of virus-receptor interactions have been major research goals in virology for the last two decades. In this chapter, we will describe, from a structural perspective, several virus-receptor interactions and the active role of receptor molecules in virus entry.","Casasnovas, José M.",Structure and Physics of Viruses,47,26

Medical practitioners have anecdotally reported encounters with patient-held misinformation, but to date we lack evidence that quantifies this phenomenon. We surveyed licensed practitioners in the state of North Carolina to better understand how often patients mention MM in the clinical setting, and if medical practitioners are trained to engage with patients in these specific conversations. We administered an anonymous, online survey to physicians and physician assistants licensed to practice in the state of North Carolina. Questions focused on demographics, clinical encounters with MM, and training to discuss MM with patients. We received over 2800 responses and analyzed 2183 after removing ineligible responses. Our results showed that most respondents encountered MM from patients (94.2% (2047/2183)), with no significant differences between clinical specialty, time spent in practice, or community type. When asked about specific training, 18% (380/2081) reported formal experiences and 39% (807/289) reported informal experiences. MM has been salient due to the COVID-19 pandemic; however, it was present before and will remain after the pandemic. Given that MM is widespread but practitioners lack training on engaging patients in these conversations, a sustained effort to specifically train current and future practitioners on how to engage patients about MM would be an important step toward mitigating the spread of MM.","Wood, Jamie L.; Lee, Grace Y.; Stinnett, Sandra S.; Southwell, Brian G.",Inquiry,47,24

A hypothetical GP5 containing all selected sites was constructed to determine its characteristics. These sequences corresponded to isolates obtained 10 years apart (1991–1995, 18 strains) and a second set (n =46) from 2000 to 2005. Similarity to Lelystad virus (LV) decreased from 95.5% in 1991–1995 to 89.5% in 2000–2005. Three highly variable regions were found in ORF5. Codon usage was different in both sets for leucine, glutamine, serine and proline. Thus, 2000–2005 sequences used codons more similar to those present in highly expressed pig genes compared to the 1991–1995 set. Twenty four sites of positive selection and 20 sites of negative selection were found in GP5, most of them in transmembrane regions. Additional glycosylation in N37 of GP5 was common in 2000–2005 but some sequences lack a glycosylation site in N46. The hypothetical GP5 was only 88.1% similar to LV and was less hydrophobic. Taking together these results suggest that PRRSV is still adapting to pig cells.","Mateu, E.; Díaz, I.; Darwich, L.; Casal, J.; Martín, M.; Pujols, J.",Virus Research,47,1

Targeted therapy has a limited effect on the treatment of advanced stages due to evolving resistance mechanisms. The aim of this study was to assess the distribution of growth factor receptors in oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer (OPSCC) and evaluate their role in the context of the human papillomavirus status, prognosis and possible relevance for targeted therapy. Tissue microarrays of 78 primary OPSCC, 35 related lymph node metastasis, 6 distant metastasis and 9 recurrent tumors were manufactured to evaluate the expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/erbB/Her)1–4 and c-Met by immunohistochemistry. EGFR and c-Met are relevant negative prognostic factors especially in noxae-induced OPSCC. Thus, dual targeting of EGFR and c-Met could be a promising prospective target in OPSCC treatment. Frequent coexpression of assessed receptors represents a possible intrinsic resistance mechanism in targeted therapy. ABSTRACT: This study aimed to assess the distribution of growth factor receptors in oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer (OPSCC) and evaluate their role in the context of human papillomavirus (HPV) status, prognosis and potential relevance for targeted therapy. The protein expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor (Her)1–4 and c-Met were retrospectively assessed using semiquantitative immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays and analyzed for correlations as well as differences in the clinicopathological criteria. Her1–4 and c-met were overexpressed compared to normal mucosa in 46%, 4%, 17%, 27% and 23%, respectively. Interestingly, most receptors were coexpressed. Her1 and c-Met were inversely correlated with p16 (p = 0.04; p = 0.02). Her2 and c-Met were associated with high tobacco consumption (p = 0.016; p = 0.04). High EGFR, Her3, Her4 and c-Met expression were associated with worse overall and disease-free survival (p ≤ 0.05). Furthermore, EGFR and c-Met expression showed raised hazard ratios of 2.53 (p = 0.02; 95% CI 1.24–5.18) and 2.45 (p = 0.02; 95% CI 1.13–5.35), respectively. Her4 was expressed less in distant metastases than in corresponding primary tumors and was correlated to a higher T category. EGFR and c-Met are relevant negative prognostic factors in OPSCC, independent of known clinicopathological parameters. We suggest dual targeting of EGFR and c-Met as a promising strategy for OPSCC treatment.","Deuss, Eric; Gößwein, Dorothee; Gül, Désirée; Zimmer, Stefanie; Foersch, Sebastian; Eger, Claudia S.; Limburg, Ivonne; Stauber, Roland H.; Künzel, Julian",Cancers (Basel),47,21

However, it is unknown whether COVID-19 pandemic has differentially affected sleep and mental health depending on the circadian type. Here, the differences in sleep and mental health between circadian types are examined globally before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The sample collected between May and August 2020 across 12 countries/regions consisted of 19 267 adults with information on their circadian type. Statistical analyses were performed by using Complex Sample procedures, stratified by country and weighted by the number of inhabitants in the country/area of interest and by the relative number of responders in that country/area. RESULTS: Evening-types had poorer mental health, well-being, and quality of life or health than other circadian types during the pandemic. Sleep–wake schedules were delayed especially on working days, and evening-types reported an increase in sleep duration. Sleep problems increased in all circadian types, but especially among evening-types, moderated by financial suffering and confinement. Intermediate-types were less vulnerable to sleep changes, although morningness protected from most sleep problems.

A new method for ensuring communication between different areas, using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks with a well-established mobility schedule is proposed. UAVs fly based on a mission plan using regular polygons covering an area from a map. The area is considered to be equidistantly covered with points, grouped in triangles which are further grouped into hexagons. In this paper, UAVs, including battery charging or battery swapping stations and light weight Wi-Fi boards, are used for the data transfer among drones and stations using delivery protocols. UAV network analysis and evaluation (lengths of the arcs in seconds) based on experimental preliminary flight tests are proposed. Multiple simulations are performed based on six DTN algorithms, single-copy, and multiple-copies algorithms, and the efficiency of data transmission (delivery rate and latency) is analyzed.

Drugs targeting anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins that were originally developed as tumor suppressors have been reported to inhibit multiplication of different types of viruses. However, the mechanisms whereby Bcl-2 inhibitors exert their antiviral activity remain poorly understood. In this study, we have investigated the mechanisms by which obatoclax (OLX) and ABT-737 Bcl-2 inhibitors exhibited a potent antiviral activity against the mammarenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). OLX and ABT-737 potent anti-LCMV activity was not associated with their pro-apoptotic properties, but rather their ability of inducing cell arrest at G0/G1 phase. OLX and ABT-737 mediated inhibition of Bcl-2 correlated with reduced expression levels of thymidine kinase 1 (TK1), cyclin A2 (CCNA2), and cyclin B1 (CCNB1) cell cycle regulators. In addition, siRNA-mediated knock down of TK1, CCNA2, and CCNB1 resulted in reduced levels of LCMV multiplication. The antiviral activity exerted by Bcl-2 inhibitors correlated with reduced levels of viral RNA synthesis at early times of infection. Importantly, ABT-737 exhibited moderate efficacy in a mouse model of LCMV infection, and Bcl-2 inhibitors displayed broad-spectrum antiviral activities against different mammarenaviruses and SARS-CoV-2. Our results suggest that Bcl-2 inhibitors, actively being explored as anti-cancer therapeutics, might be repositioned as broad-spectrum antivirals. IMPORTANCE Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 inhibitors have been shown to exert potent antiviral activities against various types of viruses via mechanisms that are currently poorly understood. This study has revealed that Bcl-2 inhibitors mediated cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, rather than their pro-apoptotic activity, plays a critical role in blocking mammarenavirus multiplication in cultured cells. In addition, we show that Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT-737 exhibited moderate anti-mammarenavirus activity in vivo, and that Bcl-2 inhibitors displayed broad-spectrum antiviral activities against different mammarenaviruses and SARS-CoV-2. Our results suggest that Bcl-2 inhibitors, actively being explored as anti-cancer therapeutics, might be repositioned as broad-spectrum antivirals.","Kim, Yu-Jin; Witwit, Haydar; Cubitt, Beatrice; de la Torre, Juan C.",bioRxiv,47,29

Purpose: Informed by symbolic interactionism and Deweyan transactionalism, the aim of this study was to develop a transactional model of how narrative identity and relationships are promoted through the use of a new technological solution, SENSE-GARDEN, that uses digital technologies and multisensory stimuli to facilitate individualized, meaningful activities. Method: We conducted a qualitative interview study to explore the experiences of people with moderate to advanced dementia and their caregivers in Norway and Portugal. After using SENSE-GARDEN for 12–16 weeks, 20 participants (7 persons with dementia and 13 caregivers) were interviewed. The interviews were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Results: Three themes were generated: openness, learning, and connection. Findings suggest that SENSE-GARDEN can stimulate emotional experiences, preserve narrative identity, and foster interpersonal relationships. These findings are illustrated through a transactional model. Conclusion: This study highlights the complex multitude of factors affecting person-environment interactions in which narrative identity and relationships are constructed. To better understand these factors, future work should adopt a holistic approach to studying new methods of creating meaningful activities in dementia care.","Goodall, Gemma; André, Lara; Taraldsen, Kristin; Serrano, J Artur",International journal of qualitative studies on health and well-being,47,16

Besides the lungs it can also affect other organs like the heart or the liver. Whether there is a pancreatic manifestation as well is currently unclear. METHODS: and aims: We prospectively collected patient information of patients with Covid-19 associated ARDS in a registry (COvid Registry REChts der Isar intensive care Trial – CORRECT) and analyzed this patient cohort for signs of acute pancreatitis (e.g. lipase activity >3 times the upper limit). RESULTS: 12/38 (31.6%) patients with Covid-19 associated ARDS had a serum lipase activity >180 U/l. Median lipase activity was 422 U/l (186–1127). No patient showed typical findings of acute pancreatitis on imaging studies. On hemodynamic monitoring no patient had signs of intravascular fluid demand regarding MAP, GEDVI and therapy with vasopressors. To avoid worsening respiratory function no treatment with crystalloids was initiated. Lipasemia was not explained by gastroenteritis or renal insufficiency, occurred before as well as after viral clearance and 16.1 ± 6.0 days after the first symptoms. No patient developed severe acute pancreatitis during the follow up period of 35.8 ± 8.3 days. CONCLUSION: High lipasemia without typical signs of acute pancreatitis is a frequent finding in severe Covid-19 associated ARDS. Considering the markedly high levels of serum lipase activity, we think impaired microcirculation in severely ill patients can explain this finding rather than extra-pancreatic co-morbidities (UTN: DRKS00021612).","Rasch, Sebastian; Herner, Alexander; Schmid, Roland M.; Huber, Wolfgang; Lahmer, Tobias",Pancreatology,47,1

In addition to their use in the study of virus RNA replication and virus assembly, coronavirus DI RNAs are being used in a major way to study the mechanism of a high-frequency, site-specific RNA recombination event that leads to leader acquisition during virus replication (i.e., the leader fusion event that occurs during synthesis of subgenomic mRNAs, and the leader-switching event that can occur during DI RNA replication), a distinguishing feature of coronaviruses (and arteriviruses).

Binding antibody titers to the spike (S) protein were also determined by a clinically available serological assay (Ortho-Vitros total IG), and an in-house ELISA. The results of these assays were compared to a measurement of antibodies directed to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV2 S protein (Promega Lumit Dx). RESULTS: All measures of antibodies were highly variable, but correlated, to different degrees, with each other. However, the anti-RBD antibodies correlated with viral neutralizing titers to a greater extent than the other antibody assays. DISCUSSION: Our observations support the use of an anti-RBD assay such as the Lumit Dx assay, as an optimal predictor of the neutralization capability of CCP.","Janaka, Sanath Kumar; Clark, Natasha M.; Evans, David T.; Mou, Huihui; Farzan, Michael; Connor, Joseph P.",PLoS One,47,28

The government has increased its expectations on the sports movement and become more result-oriented, which, for example, its revised motives for supporting the sports movement and the establishment of an audit organization can illustrate. However, in contrast to other countries, the Swedish government has not introduced any financial cutbacks in its support for sports. Rather, the opposite is true. The financial support has increased significantly over the last two decades. In the paper, we argue that this contradictory development of Swedish sport policy can be understood as expressions of neoliberalism and social entrepreneurship. As a theoretical concept, social entrepreneurship offers a way of understanding the increased Swedish government support for sport. There are in particular two underlying reasons for this claim. Firstly, sport is considered as a solution to various societal problems, such as social exclusion and refugee crises. Secondly, much of the increased support has been in form of various large-scale, earmarked, and time-limited political initiatives/reforms and project grants, which all have aimed to achieve social change through sport, such as social inclusion. In the paper, we consider these initiatives as expressions of social entrepreneurship. This paper contributes to the ongoing scholarly debate on how neoliberalism and neoliberal policies in the public sector have affected sport organizations. Also, by using social entrepreneurship theory, we provide new theoretical insights into how sport policy can be understood and analyzed.","Bjärsholm, Daniel; Norberg, Johan R.",Front Sports Act Living,47,20

A set of benchmark functions evaluates the performance of this algorithm for discrete and continuous problems by comparing the results with those of other well-known optimization algorithms. The CVO algorithm aims to find suitable solutions to application problems by solving several continuous mathematical functions as well as three continuous and discrete applications.

To present day, however, lack of race-disaggregated individual data has prevented a rigorous assessment of the extent of this phenomenon and the reasons why blacks may be particularly vulnerable to the disease. Using individual and georeferenced death data collected daily by the Cook County Medical Examiner, we provide first evidence that race does affect COVID-19 outcomes. The data confirm that in Cook County blacks are overrepresented in terms of COVID-19 related deaths since - as of June 16, 2020 - they constitute 35 percent of the dead, so that they are dying at a rate 1.3 times higher than their population share. Furthermore, by combining the spatial distribution of mortality with the 1930s redlining maps for the Chicago area, we obtain a block group level panel dataset of weekly deaths over the period January 1, 2020-June 16, 2020, over which we establish that, after the outbreak of the epidemic, historically lower-graded neighborhoods display a sharper increase in mortality, driven by blacks, while no pre-treatment differences are detected. Thus, we uncover a persistence influence of the racial segregation induced by the discriminatory lending practices of the 1930s, by way of a diminished resilience of the black population to the shock represented by the COVID-19 outbreak. A heterogeneity analysis reveals that the main channels of transmission are socioeconomic status and household composition, whose influence is magnified in combination with a higher black share.","Bertocchi, G.; Dimico, A.",,47,20

By about 2010, however, the ‘opioid crisis’, featuring unprecedented use and public health burden, had accelerated into full force in North America, largely muting attention to the psycho-stimulant issue until recently. Recent surveillance data on drug use and related mortality/morbidity from the present decade has documented a marked resurgence of psycho-stimulant use and harms especially in at-risk populations, commonly in direct combination with opioids, across North America, resulting in a ‘twin epidemic’ comprised of opioids and psycho-stimulants We briefly review select epidemiological data indicators for these developments from the United States and Canada; in the latter jurisdiction, related evidence has been less prevalent and systematic but corroborating the same trends. Evidently, the (widely ongoing) focus on the ‘opioid epidemic’ as a ‘mono-type’ drug problem has become an anachronism that requires urgent and appropriate correction. We then briefly consider existing, evidence-based options for – prevention and treatment – interventions targeting psycho-stimulant use and harms, which are substantially more limited and/or less efficacious than those available for problematic opioid use, while presenting major gaps and challenges. The observed resurgence of psycho-stimulants may, indirectly, relate to recent efforts towards curtailing (medical) opioid availability, thereby accelerating demand and supply for both illicit opioids and psycho-stimulants. The presently unfolding ‘twin epidemic’ of opioids and psycho-stimulants, combined with limited intervention resources, presents an acute challenge for public health and may crucially undermine actively extensive efforts to reduce opioid-related health harms in North America.","Fischer, Benedikt; O’Keefe-Markman, Caroline; Lee, Angelica (Min-Hye); Daldegan-Bueno, Dimitri",Subst Abuse Treat Prev Policy,47,20

The world of sport has obviously been severely affected by the pandemic, as authorities progressively canceled all level of competitions, including the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo. In Spain, the initial government-lockdown closed the Sports High-performance Centers, and many other sports facilities. In order to support athlete's health and performance at crises like these, an online questionnaire named RECOVID-19, was designed to assess how athletes were living their lives during such periods of home confinement. The main purpose of the questionnaire was to assess the impact of prolongued confinement on athlete's psychological, emotional, and behavioral performance. One thousand, two hundred forty-eight athletes participated in the survey. They had the fllowing characteristics: (Mean age = 22.31 ± 11.49, Female: 53%), who compete at National (N: 1017, Mean age = 21.58 ± 11.42, Female: 52%) and International level (N: 231, Mean age = 25.56 ± 11.22, Female: 57%). Results showed that during the confinement period, those athletes who lacked motivation reported a higher level of stressful thoughts, more behavioral problems, and greater emotional upheaval (anger, fatigue, tension, and depression). However, those athletes who accepted confinement measures as necessary, and were in favor of respecting the rules of social isolation, fostered positive emotional states such as feelings of friendship. In addition, the availability of some sport equipment together with the ability to continue some training, were (1) protective factors against emotional stress, lack of motivation and behavioral problems; and (2) they were associated with greater respect for, and adherence to, confinement rules. Gender differences, tested by multigroup analysis, revealed that coping activities were more often associated to negative emotional states among women, whereas the ongoing availability of training information and future conditions were equally protective factors for both genders. This study also showed that receiving coaching, support and completing frequent training routines seem to be valuable tools to prevent or reduce some of the harmful effects of isolation on athlete's emotional well-being. The conclusions derived from this research would possibly help sport authorities to design supporting policies and plans to support athletes and trainers in future disruptive health crises.","Jaenes Sánchez, José Carlos; Alarcón Rubio, David; Trujillo, Manuel; Peñaloza Gómez, Rafael; Mehrsafar, Amir Hossien; Chirico, Andrea; Giancamilli, Francesco; Lucidi, Fabio",Front Psychol,47,16

Therefore, this scoping review was performed to determine the prevalence of intention to use COVID-19 vaccines among adults aged 18–60, and to identify the demographic, social, and contextual factors that influence the intention to use COVID-19 vaccines. Methods: This scoping review was conducted by using the methodological framework for scoping review outlined by Arksey and O’Malley. A search strategy was carried out on four electronic databases: PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. All peer-reviewed articles published between November 2019 and December 2020 were reviewed. Data were extracted to identify the prevalence of, and factors that influence, the intention to use COVID-19 vaccines. Results: A total of 48 relevant articles were identified for inclusion in the review. Outcomes presented fell into seven themes: demographics, social factors, vaccination beliefs and attitudes, vaccine-related perceptions, health-related perceptions, perceived barriers, and vaccine recommendations. Age, gender, education level, race/ethnicity, vaccine safety and effectiveness, influenza vaccination history, and self-protection from COVID-19 were the most prominent factors associated with intention to use COVID-19 vaccines. Furthermore, the majority of studies (n = 34/48) reported a relatively high prevalence of intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19, with a range from 60% to 93%. Conclusion: This scoping review enables the creation of demographic, social, and contextual constructs associated with intention to vaccinate among the adult population. These factors are likely to play a major role in any targeted vaccination programs, particularly COVID-19 vaccination. Thus, our review suggests focusing on the development of strategies to promote the intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and to overcome vaccine hesitancy and refusal. These strategies could include transparent communication, social media engagement, and the initiation of education programs.","AlShurman, Bara’ Abdallah; Khan, Amber Fozia; Mac, Christina; Majeed, Meerab; Butt, Zahid Ahmad",Int J Environ Res Public Health,47,1

This study is to investigate the relationship between the massive migration and the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in China. METHODS: The epidemic data between January 25th and February 15th and migration data between Jan 1st and Jan 24th were collected from the official websites. Using the R package WGCNA, we established a scale-free network of the selected cities. Correlation analysis was applied to describe the correlation between the Spring Migration and COVID-19 epidemic. RESULTS: The epidemic seriousness in Hubei (except the city of Wuhan) was closely correlated with the migration from Wuhan between January 10 and January 24, 2020. The epidemic seriousness in the other provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions was largely affected by the immigration from Wuhan. By establishing a scale-free network of the regions, we divided the regions into two modules. The regions in the brown module consisted of three municipalities, nine provincial capitals and other 12 cities. The COVID-19 epidemics in these regions were more likely to be aggravated by migration. CONCLUSIONS: The migration from Wuhan could partly explain the epidemic seriousness in Hubei Province and other regions. The scale-free network we have established can better evaluate the epidemic.

Conformationally unrestricted spacer between the lactone and 1,2,3-triazole units in 8a−8u series had a profound effect on antitumor activity. Besides, the introduction of a long side chain at C-4 of 1,2,3-triazole that led to the synthesis of decyl-substituted 2,3-dibenzyl-l-ascorbic acid 8m accounted for a selective and potent antiproliferative activity on breast cancer MCF-7 cells cells in the nM range.

The IFN-induced transmembrane 3 (IFITM3) has recently been identified as an ISG and plays a pivotal role against enveloped RNA viruses by restricting cell entry. However, the role of IFITM3 in PRRSV replication is unknown. The present study demonstrated that overexpression of IFITM3 suppresses PRRSV replication, while silencing of endogenous IFITM3 prominently promoted PRRSV replication. Additionally, it was shown that IFITM3 undergoes S-palmitoylation and ubiquitination modification, and both posttranslational modifications contribute to the anti-PRRSV activity of IFITM3. Further study showed that PRRSV particles are transported into endosomes and then into lysosomes during the early stages of infection, and confocal microscopy results revealed that PRRSV particles are transported to IFITM3-positive cellular vesicles. By using a single virus particle fluorescent labeling technique, we confirmed that IFITM3 can restrict PRRSV membrane fusion by inducing accumulation of cholesterol in cellular vesicles. Additionally, we found that both endogenous and exogenous IFITM3 are incorporated into newly producing PRRS virions and diminish viral intrinsic infectivity. By using cell coculture systems, we found that IFITM3 effectively restricted PRRSV intercellular transmission, which may have been caused by disrupted membrane fusion and reduced viral infectivity. In conclusion, our results demonstrate, for the first time, that swine IFITM3 interferes with the life cycle of PRRSV, and possibly other enveloped arteritis viruses, at multiple steps. IMPORTANCE Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), which is caused by PRRS virus (PRRSV), is of great economic significance to the swine industry. Due to the complicated immune escape mechanisms of PRRSV, there are no effective vaccines or therapeutic drugs currently available against PRRS. Identification of cellular factors and underlying mechanisms that establish an effective antiviral state against PRRSV can provide unique strategies for developing antiviral vaccines or drugs. As an interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene, the role of IFN-induced transmembrane 3 (IFITM3) in PRRSV infection has not been reported as of yet. In the present study, it was shown that IFITM3 can exert a potent anti-PRRSV effect, and PRRS virions are trafficked to IFITM3-containing cell vesicles, where viral membrane fusion is impaired by cholesterol accumulation that is induced by IFITM3. Additionally, both endogenous and exogenous IFITM3 are incorporated into newly assembled progeny virions, and this decreased their intrinsic infectivity.","Zhang, Angke; Duan, Hong; Zhao, Huijun; Liao, Huancheng; Du, Yongkun; Li, Liangliang; Jiang, Dawei; Wan, Bo; Wu, Yanan; Ji, Pengchao; Zhou, En-Min; Zhang, Gaiping",J Virol,47,30

Although the pandemic affected people from all walks of life, irrespective of age or gender, the way the risk is perceived varies from one person to another. The pandemic risk reduction strategies can only be effective if individuals and communities respond positively to them, and for that, it is important to understand how the risk is perceived and responded to, differently by different groups of people. Gender plays a vital role in shaping risk perceptions and coping strategies, reflecting the predisposition of the public to accept health interventions and take precautionary measures. This study aims to understand the gender differences in COVID-19 risk perception and coping mechanisms – Pakistan is selected as a case study area. Following on from designing the questionnaire, which included 40 indicators grouped into domains (four risk perception and three coping mechanisms domains), an online survey was conducted, and a sample of 389 respondents was collected (248 male and 141 female). An index-based approach was used to quantify risk perception and its domains (fear, behaviour, awareness, and trust), and likewise coping mechanisms and their domains (problem, emotion, and action). Statistical tests were employed to ascertain the differences among both genders, whereas regression modelling was used to measure the effect of gender on overall risk perception and coping mechanisms. Results reveal that perceived fear and trust varied significantly between Pakistani men and women, while coping mechanisms were also notably different between the two genders. Females were found to perceive risks higher, complied more with the government's guidelines, and coped better than males in response to COVID-19. These findings imply that the gender aspect must be incorporated in designing effective communication and risk reduction strategies to efficiently address the current and potential future pandemic situations.","Rana, Irfan Ahmad; Bhatti, Saad Saleem; Aslam, Atif Bilal; Jamshed, Ali; Ahmad, Junaid; Shah, Ashfaq Ahmad",Int J Disaster Risk Reduct,47,26

Whether patients with history of headache suffer more from vaccination-induced headaches is unknown. We aimed to uncover if headache patients develop more headaches after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination than healthy controls. METHODS: We performed a questionnaire survey for nursing staff in our hospital from April to May 2021. Based on baseline characteristics, we divided the participants into migraine, non-migrainous headache, and healthy control, and examined the occurrence and features of headache after COVID-19 vaccinations. RESULTS: We included 171 participants (15.2% migraine and 24.6% non-migrainous headache). Headache incidence after vaccinations was significantly higher in the migraine (69.2%) and non-migrainous headache (71.4%) groups than in the healthy control (37.9%) group. The incidence of headaches was significantly higher after the second dose compared to the first (45.6% vs. 20.5%). CONCLUSION: Migraineurs and non-migrainous headache participants developed more headaches compared to the healthy controls after COVID-19 vaccination.","Sekiguchi, Koji; Watanabe, Narumi; Miyazaki, Naoki; Ishizuchi, Kei; Iba, Chisato; Tagashira, Yu; Uno, Shunsuke; Shibata, Mamoru; Hasegawa, Naoki; Takemura, Ryo; Nakahara, Jin; Takizawa, Tsubasa",Cephalalgia,47,1

This study accordingly explores the perceptions and experiences of staff providing direct caregiving services to the elderly residents at three care homes during the time of the coronavirus pandemic in Karachi, Pakistan. DESIGN: Using a qualitative approach, 27 digitally‐recorded, semi‐structured, face‐to‐face interviews were performed with current and former caregiving staff members. The data was analyzed through qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Analysis highlights various kinds of challenges that were faced by the caregivers and their families during the pandemic. The main theme class identified from the data was “living in anxiety and fear.” The work‐related decisions made by caregivers at that time were mainly influenced by their familial demands and responsibilities. CONCLUSION: Caregivers were at risk of catching the lethal virus through inhalation of or physical contact with infectious particles, but despite that most of them continued to render elderly care services. This study’s findings could be used by government leaders and care home administrations when making coronavirus containment policies, designing economic relief packages, and formulating caregiving training programs in Pakistan or other countries in the world.

S protein mediates the SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cells. The “fusion core” of the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) on S plays a crucial role in the virus infectivity, as it is part of a key membrane fusion architecture. While SARS-CoV-2 was becoming a global threat, scientists have been accumulating data on the virus at an impressive pace, both in terms of genomic sequences and of three-dimensional structures. On 15 February 2021, from the SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences in the GISAID resource, we collected 415,673 complete S protein sequences and identified all the mutations occurring in the HR1 fusion core. This is a 21-residue segment, which, in the post-fusion conformation of the protein, gives many strong interactions with the heptad repeat 2, bringing viral and cellular membranes in proximity for fusion. We investigated the frequency and structural effect of novel mutations accumulated over time in such a crucial region for the virus infectivity. Three mutations were quite frequent, occurring in over 0.1% of the total sequences. These were S929T, D936Y, and S949F, all in the N-terminal half of the HR1 fusion core segment and particularly spread in Europe and USA. The most frequent of them, D936Y, was present in 17% of sequences from Finland and 12% of sequences from Sweden. In the post-fusion conformation of the unmutated S protein, D936 is involved in an inter-monomer salt bridge with R1185. We investigated the effect of the D936Y mutation on the pre-fusion and post-fusion state of the protein by using molecular dynamics, showing how it especially affects the latter one.","Oliva, Romina; Shaikh, Abdul Rajjak; Petta, Andrea; Vangone, Anna; Cavallo, Luigi",Molecules,47,26

This commentary will briefly clear the myth that CBD can ameliorate a wide range of COVID-19 associated health effects including anxiety, depression, or any substance use disorder, and show that there is a clear lack of sufficient unbiased clinical evidence from well-designed double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials to prove the antianxiety or antidepression therapeutic properties of CBD and support its wide use as medicine to treat COVID-19- associated mental health conditions or substance use disorders. Finally, we suggest that addiction physicians must play an important role in dealing with their patients requesting CBD prescription for treating any of these conditions.","Khalsa, Jag H.; Bunt, Greg; Maggirwar, Sanjay B.; Kottilil, Shyam",J Addict Med,47,24

We enrolled 56 SARS-CoV-2-positive pregnant women, of which 46 (82%) were in the third trimester of pregnancy, 6 (10%) in the second and 4 (7%) in the first. QPCR was performed to detect the virus in vaginal and rectal swabs and in plasma samples. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 27% of rectal swabs of pregnant women in the third trimester, while no virus particles were detected in vaginal swabs of the same patients. Furthermore, only 4% plasma samples tested positive to SARS-CoV-2. No virus was detected in newborn’s nasopharyngeal swabs. Despite the low number of subjects enrolled, our data suggest that, while theoretically possible, intrapartum vaginal or orofecal SARS-CoV-2 transmission seems to be unlikely.","Fenizia, Claudio; Saulle, Irma; Di Giminiani, Maria; Vanetti, Claudia; Trabattoni, Daria; Parisi, Francesca; Biasin, Mara; Savasi, Valeria",Reprod Sci,47,8

Epidemiological studies revealed that population has different vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2: severe outcome of COVID-19, with an increased risk of death, is observed in patients with metabolic syndrome, diabetic and heart conditions (frail population). Excessive pro-inflammatory cytokine storm could be the main cause of enlarged vulnerability in frail population. In subjects with diabetes and/or heart disease, a low inflammatory state is often associated with gut dysbiosis. The increase of microbial metabolites (i.e. TMAO and LPS), generating an inflammatory microenvironment is probably associated with an improved risk of severe illness from COVID-19. Nutritional interventions aimed at restoring gut microbial balance could represent preventive strategies to protect frail population from COVID-19. This narrative review presents the possible molecular mechanisms by which intestinal dysbiosis, enhancing inflammatory state, could promote SARS-CoV-2 spreading infection. Some nutritional strategies to counteract inflammation state in frail patients are also analysed.","Terruzzi, Ileana; Senesi, Pamela",Nutrition,47,16

We present a community-led intervention in Latino communities that integrated social services in mental health service delivery for an equity-based response. METHODS: We used tracking sheets to identify 1,436 unique participants (aged 5–86) enrolled in Latino Health Access’s Emotional Wellness program, of whom 346 enrolled in the pre–COVID-19 period (March 2019–February 2020) and 1,090 in the COVID-19 period (March–June 2020). Demographic characteristics and types of services were aggregated to assess monthly trends using Pearson 𝜒(2) tests. Regression models were developed to compare factors associated with referrals in the pre–COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods. RESULTS: During the pandemic, service volume (P < .001) and participant volume (P < .001) increased significantly compared with the prepandemic period. Participant characteristics were similar during both periods, the only differences being age distribution, expanded geographic range, and increased male participation during the pandemic. Nonreferred services, such as peer support, increased during the pandemic period. Type of referrals significantly changed from primarily mental health services and disease management in the prepandemic period to affordable housing support, food assistance, and supplemental income. CONCLUSION: An effective mental health program in response to the pandemic must incorporate direct mental health services and address social needs that exacerbate mental health risk for Latino communities. This study presents a model of how to integrate both factors by leveraging promotor-led programs.","Moon, Kyle J.; Montiel, Gloria Itzel; Cantero, Patricia J.; Nawaz, Saira",Prev Chronic Dis,47,1

This qualitative phenomenological study’s general purpose is to analyze, from a personal perspective, the situations and needs of grandparents who have grandchildren with Down syndrome. The participants’ ages range from 65 to 85, and the ages of their grandchildren with Down syndrome range from 3 to 21 years. All participants had one grandchild with a disability, except for two, who each had two. A sociodemographic questionnaire was administered, and individual interviews were conducted, using open questions, through phone and/or video calls. An analysis of the participants’ speech was carried out, which implied the development of a system of meta-categories and categories. This analysis was developed manually, given the COVID-19 environment. The results indicate a substantial change from negative feelings caused by the knowledge of the diagnosis to feelings related to positive experiences expressed currently. The participants see themselves as a fundamental source of support (informal, instrumental, practical, social, emotional, and economic) for their families and, mainly, for their grandchildren with Down syndrome. A need for information and training was observed when the grandparents talked about first being informed of the diagnosis and their concerns about the future of these grandchildren and their siblings. They made social demands, such as greater government involvement or more significant opportunities to access resources and rights for their grandchildren. The results are discussed, as are possible future research directions.","Sánchez Gómez, María C.; Martín-Sevillano, Rocío; Martín-Cilleros, María V.; Marcos, J. J.

Tyrosine (Tyr) deficiency as well as its excess are issues that can affect mental health and can generate disorders such as depression, anxiety, or stress. Tyr is the amino acid (AA) responsible for maintaining good mental health, and for this reason, the present research presents the development of new electrochemical sensors modified with polypyrrole (PPy) doped with different doping agents such as potassium hexacyanoferrate (II) (FeCN), sodium nitroprusside (NP), and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) for a selective and sensitive detection of Tyr. The development of the sensors was carried out by chronoamperometry (CA) and the electrochemical characterization was carried out by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The detection limits (LOD) obtained with each modified sensor were 8.2 × 10(−8) M in the case of PPy /FeCN-SPCE, 4.3 × 10(−7) M in the case of PPy/NP-SPCE, and of 3.51 × 10(−7) M in the case of PPy/SDS-SPCE, thus demonstrating a good sensitivity of these sensors detecting L-Tyr. The validation of sensors was carried out through quantification of L-Tyr from three pharmaceutical products by the standard addition method with recoveries in the range 99.92–103.97%.
