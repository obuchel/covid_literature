Suppressed protective immunity was shown in these patients. Although several hypotheses have been formulated, the mechanism of DENV-induced immunosuppression remains unclear. Previously, we found that cross-reactive antibodies against tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptor 1 (death receptor 4 [DR4]) were elicited in DHF patients, and that anti-DR4 autoantibody fractions were elicited by nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) immunizations in experimental mice. In this study, we found that anti-DR4 antibodies could suppress B lymphocyte function in vitro and in vivo. Treatment with the anti-DR4 immunoglobulin (Ig) induced caspase-dependent cell death in immortalized B lymphocyte Raji cells in vitro. Anti-DR4 Igs elicited by NS1 and DR4 immunizations markedly suppressed mouse spleen transitional T2 B (IgM(+)IgD(+)), bone marrow pre-pro-B (B220(+)CD43(+)), pre-B (B220(+)CD43(−)), and mature B cell (B220(+)IgD(+)) subsets in mice. Furthermore, functional analysis revealed that the pre-elicitation of anti-NS1 and anti-DR4 Ig titers suppressed subsequently neutralizing antibody production by immunization with DENV envelop protein. Our data suggest that the elicitation of anti-DR4 titers through DENV NS1 immunization plays a suppressive role in humoral immunity in mice.","Tsai, Chung-Lin; Sun, Der-Shan; Su, Mei-Tzu; Lien, Te-Sheng; Chen, Yen-Hsu; Lin, Chun-Yu; Huang, Chung-Hao; King, Chwan-Chuen; Li, Chen-Ru; Chen, Tai-Hung; Chiu, Yu-Hsiang; Lu, Chun-Chi; Chang, Hsin-Hou",Sci Rep,588,24

Due to the importance of the immune system in osteosarcoma disease progression, immunotherapeutic strategies have been explored to potentially improve long-term survival. However, most immunotherapeutics have not reached the level of success hoped would occur in this disease. Understanding the immune system in osteosarcoma will be key to optimizing treatments and improving patient outcomes. Therefore, immunophenotyping can be used as a very powerful tool to help better understand the complexity of the immune response seen in osteosarcoma and in the use of immunotherapy in this malignancy. This book chapter will provide an overview of the known immune responses seen in this disease and potential developments for the future of immunophenotyping. Indeed, it appears that being able to track the immune system throughout the disease and treatment of patients with osteosarcoma could allow for a personalized approach to immunotherapy.","Pratt, Hillary G; Justin, E Markel; Lindsey, Brock A",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,588,17

Each mobile population (e.g. immigrants, refugees, travelers) has certain characteristics that determine public health risk and infectious disease burden. Refugees present unique challenges to public health officials and infectious disease specialists. RECENT FINDINGS Refugee migration to the United States represents the most controlled population movement between countries from a health perspective. Medical screening and programs that provide presumptive treatment for highly prevalent infectious diseases both prior to and after migration alter the infectious disease epidemiology in these populations. SUMMARY Infectious disease specialists must recognize that different characteristics of distinct mobile populations will alter infectious disease burden. This article specifically highlights how recent public health approaches have altered the epidemiology and clinical presentation of malaria, intestinal parasites and tuberculosis in refugee populations.","Stauffer, William M; Weinberg, Michelle",Current opinion in infectious diseases,588,24

However, there is no consensus on the definition of histological mucosal healing. We evaluated histological risk factors for clinical relapse in UC patients with endoscopically normal mucosa to focus on the importance of histological evaluation. Methods Patients with UC who underwent colonoscopy confirming Mayo endoscopic subscore [MES] ≤ 1 with biopsies were enrolled into this retrospective cohort. Three expert pathologists evaluated the presence or absence of chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate, breaches in the surface epithelium, crypt abscesses, mucin depletion, crypt architectural irregularities and basal plasmacytosis. Clinical relapse was defined as partial Mayo score ≥ 3 or modification of induction treatment. Prediction models of clinical relapse were generated, especially in patients with MES 0. Results A total of 194 UC patients were enrolled. Histological abnormalities existed more frequently in patients with MES 1 than those with MES 0, while the vast majority of patients still possessed at least one abnormality. There was no significant difference in time to relapse between MES 0 and 1. Crypt architectural irregularities and mucin depletion were associated with time to relapse in patients with MES ≤ 1. In patients with MES 0, the presence of mucin depletion was the only factor significantly and independently associated with the risk of relapse (hazard ratio, 2.18 [1.16-5.82]; p = 0.03). Conclusions Mucin depletion was shown to be a histological risk factor for clinical relapse in UC patients with MES 0.","Ozaki, Ryo; Kobayashi, Taku; Okabayashi, Shinji; Nakano, Masaru; Morinaga, Shojiroh; Hara, Atsuko; Ohbu, Makoto; Matsuoka, Kentaro; Toyonaga, Takahiko; Saito, Eiko; Hisamatsu, Tadakazu; Hibi, Toshifumi",Journal of Crohn's & colitis,588,24

On one side, there were natural disasters such as the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), desert locusts, floods, and droughts exacerbating the world food crisis, while on the other side, the social development and changes in lifestyles prompted the health industry to gradually shift from a traditional medical model to a new pattern of prevention, treatment, and nourishment. Therefore, this article reviews animal by-products collagen and derived peptide, as important components of innovative sustainable food systems. The review also considered the preparation, identification, and characterization of animal by-product collagen and collagen peptides as well as their impacts on the food system (including food processing, packaging, preservation, and functional foods). Finally, the application and research progress of animal by-product collagen and peptide in the food system along with the future development trend were discussed. This knowledge would be of great significance for a comprehensive understanding of animal by-product collagen and collagen peptides and would encourage the use of collagen in food processing, preservation, and functional foods.","Cao, Changwei; Xiao, Zhichao; Ge, Changrong; Wu, Yinglong",Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,588,17

METHODS A cross-sectional survey based on self-reported vaccine uptake including WLP and KTR ≤ 1½ years post transplantation. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression analyses identifying factors associated with influenza vaccine uptake in the latest season were performed. RESULTS A total of 220 participants were included in the study, 54% KTR and 46% WLP. Self-reported influenza vaccine uptake in the latest season was overall 41.8%. Uptake of influenza vaccine any prior season apart from the latest season was 53.2% and significantly higher among WLP than KTR (p=0.007). Pneumococcal vaccine uptake was only 4% overall. The only factor positively associated with influenza vaccine uptake in the latest season was any prior influenza vaccine uptake (OR 5.79, CI95 2.44-13.76) (p<0.001). Recommendations given by other persons (non-physician) were negatively associated with receiving the influenza vaccination in the latest season (OR 0.34, CI95 0.13-0.92) (p=0.03). Reasons for not being vaccinated were primarily lack of information, perception of own good health and fear of adverse reactions. CONCLUSIONS Influenza and pneumococcal vaccine uptakes were suboptimal among Danish WLP and KTR.

Clinical academic training programmes for nurses to develop research and innovation skills alongside continued development of their clinical practice are becoming increasingly established at national, regional and local levels. Though widely supported, geographical variation in the range and scope of opportunities available remains. It is imperative that clinical academic opportunities for nurses continue to grow to ensure equity of access and opportunity so that the potential of nurse-led clinical academic research to improve quality of care, health experience and health outcomes can be realised. In this paper we describe and report on clinical academic internship opportunities available to nurses to share internationally, a range of innovative programmes currently in operation across the UK. Examples of some of the tangible benefits for patients, professional development, clinical teams and NHS organisations resulting from these clinical academic internships are illustrated. Information from local evaluations of internship programmes were collated to report what has worked well alongside 'real-world' set-up and sustainability challenges faced in practice. Clinical academic internship schemes are often opportunistically developed, making use of hybrid models of delivery and funding responsive to local needs and available resources. Key enablers of successful clinical academic internship programmes for nurses were support from senior clinical leaders and established relationships with local universities and wider organisations committed to research capacity building.","Olive, Philippa; Maxton, Fiona; Bell, Cate Ann; Bench, Suzanne; Tinkler, Linda; Jones, Steph; Kenkre, Joyce",Journal of clinical nursing,588,20

The poll also sought to uncover changes in perception before and after the onset of COVID-19. A random sample was drawn from state voter files proportional to the national registered voter population by state, with quotas set by specific demographics to ensure representativeness. Overall, 1800 individuals participated between the 2 polls and weights were used in the analysis to adjust for nonresponse. From 2018 to 2020, respondents' familiarity with local public health departments rose 11% and their perception of the importance of the public health department to community health increased by 16%. In addition, support for public health departments and services differed significantly by political affiliation. In 2020, 85% of Democrats perceived the public health department to be very important while only 62% of their Republican counterparts felt similarly. Public health advocates have a unique opportunity to demand sustained funding for public health as American voters are more familiar and supportive of public health departments now than they were before the pandemic.

Patients in certain major stereotyped subsets often display remarkably consistent clinicobiological profiles, suggesting that the study of BcR IG stereotypy in CLL has important implications for understanding disease pathophysiology and refining clinical decision-making. Nevertheless, several issues remain open, especially pertaining to the actual frequency of BcR IG stereotypy and major subsets, as well as the existence of higher-order connections between individual subsets. In order to address these issues, we investigated clonotypic IGHV-IGHD-IGHJ gene rearrangements in a series of 29,856 patients with CLL, by far the largest series worldwide. We report that the stereotyped fraction of CLL peaks at 41% of the entire cohort and that all 19 previously identified major subsets retained their relative size and ranking, while 10 new ones emerged; overall, major stereotyped subsets had a cumulative frequency of 13.5%. Higher-level relationships were evident between subsets, particularly for major stereotyped subsets with unmutated IGHV genes (U-CLL), for which close relations with other subsets, termed 'satellites', were identified. Satellite subsets accounted for 3% of the entire cohort. These results confirm our previous notion that major subsets can be robustly identified and are consistent in relative size, hence representing distinct disease variants amenable to compartmentalized research with the potential of overcoming the pronounced heterogeneity of CLL. Furthermore, the existence of satellite subsets reveals a novel aspect of repertoire restriction with implications for refined molecular classification of CLL.","Agathangelidis, Andreas; Chatzidimitriou, Anastasia; Gemenetzi, Katerina; Giudicelli, Veronique; Karypidou, Maria; Plevova, Karla; Davis, Zadie A; Yan, Xiao-Jie; Jeromin, Sabine; Schneider, Christof; Pedersen, Lone Bredo; Tschumper, Renee; Sutton, Lesley A; Baliakas, Panagiotis; Scarfò, Lydia; van Gastel, Ellen J; Armand, Marine; Tausch, Eugen; Biderman, Bella; Baer, Constance; Bagnara, Davide; Navarro, Alba; de Septenville, Anne; Guido, Valentina; Mitterbauer-Hohendanner, Gerlinde; Dimovski, Aleksandar; Brieghel, Christian; Lawless, Sarah; Meggendorfer, Manja; Stranska, Kamila; Ritgen, Matthias; Facco, Monica; Tresoldi, Cristina; Visentin, Andrea; Patriarca, Andrea; Catherwood, Mark; Bonello, Lisa; Sudarikov, Andrey; Vanura, Katrina; Roumelioti, Maria; Skuhrova Francova, Hana; Moysiadis, Theodoros; Veronese, Silvio M; Giannopoulos, Krzysztof; Mansouri, Larry; Karan-Djurasevic, Teodora; Sandaltzopoulos, Raphael; Bödör, Csaba; Fais, Franco; Kater, Arnon P; Panovska-Stavridis, Irina; Rossi, Davide; Alshemmari, Salem; Panagiotidis, Panagiotis; Costeas, Paul A; Espinet, Blanca; Antic, Darko; Foroni, Letizia; Montillo, Marco; Trentin, Livio; Stavroyianni, Niki; Gaidano, Gianluca; Francia di Celle, Paola; Niemann, Carsten Utoft; Campo, Elías; Anagnostopoulos, Achilles; Pott, Christiane; Fischer, Kirsten; Hallek, Michael; Oscier, David Graham; Stilgenbauer, Stephan; Haferlach, Claudia; Jelinek, Diane F; Chiorazzi, Nicholas; Pospisilova, Sarka; Lefranc, Marie-Paule; Kossida, Sofia; Langerak, Anton W; Belessi, Chrysoula; Davi, Frederic; Rosenquist, Richard; Ghia, Paolo; Stamatopoulos, Kostas",Blood,588,1

In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that baicalin, an active compound of medicinal plant, could attenuate HT in cerebral ischemia stroke with delayed t-PA treatment. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 4.5 h and then continuously received t-PA infusion (10 mg/kg) for 0.5 h and followed by 19-h reperfusion.

Delayed t-PA infusion significantly increased the mortality rate, induced HT, blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage, and apoptotic cell death in the ischemic brains and exacerbated neurological outcomes in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion rats at 24 h after MCAO cerebral ischemia. Co-treatment of baicalin significantly reduced the mortality rates, ameliorated the t-PA-mediated BBB disruption and HT. Furthermore, baicalin showed to directly scavenge peroxynitrite and inhibit MMP-9 expression and activity in the ischemic brains with the delayed t-PA treatment. Baicalin had no effect on the t-PA fibrinolytic function indicated by t-PA activity assay.

METHODS This was a retrospective study using a consecutive cohort of 224 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in March 2020. Patients were divided into those admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU group) and those not (no ICU group), and clinical data including usage of tocilizumab were compared. Correlation between IL-6 value and tocilizumab use, as well as clinical outcomes were also investigated. RESULTS The ICU group had higher rates of preexisting comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes and coronary disease, and higher IL-6 than no ICU group (all P<0.05). Age, peak IL-6, and peak d-dimer were significant predictors of in-hospital mortality (1.05 [1.01-1.09], P=0.012, 1.001 [1.000-1.002], P=0.002, 1.10 [1.03-1.18], P=0.008). Receiver operating characteristics curve showed higher predictability of in-hospital mortality with IL-6 at peak than others (area under curve; IL-6 at peak: 0.875 [0.87-0.942], IL-6 at admission: 0.794 [0.699-0.889], d-dimer at peak 0.787 [0.690-0.883], d-dimer at admission 0.726 [0.625-0.827]). Incidence of fungal infections was significantly higher in patients who were given tocilizumab than those who were not (13.0% vs 1.1%, P<0.001). Notably, tocilizumab did not affect in-hospital mortality after adjustment including IL-6 (OR [95% CI]: 1.00 [0.27-3.72, P=0.998]). CONCLUSIONS Age, peak IL-6, and peak d-dimer levels were significant predictors of in-hospital mortality. Tocilizumab did not decrease in-hospital mortality in our cohort.

Measurement of faecal haemoglobin (f-Hb) using faecal immunochemical test (FIT) is well established in adults for detection of colorectal cancer. In adults, f-Hb has been recommended as a reliable tool to aid identification of those at low risk of significant bowel disease and has also been used in inflammatory bowel disease to assess mucosal healing. AIMS We aimed to evaluate the performance of f-Hb in the paediatric population and compare it with FCP. METHODS Children being assessed in the paediatric gastroenterology clinic for bowel symptoms had a sample sent for both FCP and f-Hb. Samples were collected over a 10-month period from November 2018 to September 2019. f-Hb was measured using an OC-Sensor. FCP was measured using LiasonïCalprotectin. RESULTS 143 samples were returned for f-Hb and in 107 a paired FCP was also available. f-Hb correlated with FCP, Spearmanâs rank coefficient 0.656 (p<0.0001). There were 35 patients with f-Hb >20 Âµg/g and in 32 of these patients FCP was >200 Âµg/g. 74 patients with f-Hb and 38 patients with FCP underwent colonoscopy. Patients with normal histology had f-Hb <4 Âµg/g; f-Hb >20 Âµg/g was associated with signification inflammationConclusion: Our study is the first to compare f-Hb and FCP in a paediatric population. Results suggest that f-Hb correlates with FCP and, as in adults, may be useful to rule out significant bowel disease.

Time to union and full weight bearing were the primary study outcomes, with perioperative blood loss, need for transfusion, need for revision surgery, and infection being the secondary outcomes. A retrospective review of 63 patients who sustained Rorabeck Type II periprosthetic femoral fractures was undertaken. Patients were pooled from 3 academic institutions between 2001 and 2009. Patients eligible for the study were identified from the electronic medical record using an IDX query of International Classification of Diseases 9 and Current Procedural Terminology codes for fixation of femur fracture with intramedullary implant or plate and screws. In the series, 35 patients were treated with intramedullary femoral nailing and 28 with a locked screw-plate. The 2 groups were compared for radiographic union at 6, 12, 24, and 36 weeks. At 36 weeks, radiographic union was significantly greater in the locked screw-plate group. Time to full weight bearing was not significantly different. A greater perioperative transfusion rate was observed in the locking plate group, but it also had an overall lower rate of reoperation, for any reason, compared with the intramedullary femoral nailing group. The results support the use of a laterally based locked plate in the treatment of Rorabeck type II distal femur periprosthetic fractures.","Horneff, John G; Scolaro, John A; Jafari, S Mehdi; Mirza, Amer; Parvizi, Javad; Mehta, Samir",Orthopedics,588,1

We sought to evaluate the effectiveness of our delivery room resuscitation protocol across a range of gestational ages in preterm infants born at <29 weeks. METHODS We performed an observational study of prospectively collected video recordings of 73 preterm infants. The percentage of bradycardic patients, time to reach target oxygen saturation and the extent of all interventions were compared between three gestational age groups: 22-24 weeks (n = 22), 25-26 weeks (n = 27) and 27-28 weeks (n = 24). RESULTS Although the same resuscitation protocol was followed for all infants, bradycardic infants born <25 weeks responded poorly and required significantly longer to reach oxygen saturation targets of >70%, >80% and >90% (p < 0.03). They required significantly more interventions and had higher rate of death (p < 0.05) and severe intraventricular haemorrhage (p < 0.03). Significantly lower heart rate and oxygen saturation values were found in infants with intraventricular haemorrhage. CONCLUSION Current recommendations for resuscitation may fail to achieve timely lung aeration in infants born at the borderline of viability, leading to higher mortality and morbidity. Sustained inflation and delayed cord clamping may be effective alternatives.","Lamberska, Tereza; Luksova, Marketa; Smisek, Jan; Vankova, Jana; Plavka, Richard",Acta paediatrica,588,1

Based on bulked segregant analyses for a F2 population generated from the crossing of a tall and a dwarf accession, we identified two QTLs associated with plant height, covering 325 candidate genes. One of these, Rc5NG4-1 encoding a putative IAA transport protein localized in the tonoplast was functionally characterized. A non-synonymous SNP (altering the amino acid sequence from Y to C at position 218) differentiated the tall and dwarf plants and we confirmed, through heterologous yeast transformation, that the IAA uptake capacities of Rc5NG4-1Y and Rc5NG4-1C were significantly different. This study provides insights into the physiological and molecular mechanisms of dwarfing in woody non-timber economically important plants, with potential to aid in the genetic breeding of castor bean and other related crops.","Wang, Zaiqing; Yu, Anmin; Li, Fei; Xu, Wei; Han, Bing; Cheng, Xiaomao; Liu, Aizhong",Scientific reports,588,1

BACKGROUND It has been suggested that patients with DM are more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection and suffer from more severe forms of the disease. METHODS A literature search was performed using PubMed, Scopus and Google search engines. RESULTS Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) is the major receptor of SARS-CoV-2 in the human host. The differential expression of ACE2 in the lungs of patients with DM makes them more susceptible to COVID-19. Additionally, acute or chronic hyperglycemia renders individuals in an immune-suppressive state, with impaired innate and adaptive immunity function, contributing also to the severity of COVID-19 infection among patients with DM. Other factors contributing to a more severe course of COVID-19 include the co-existence of obesity in T2DM; the endothelial inflammation induced by the SARS-CoV-2 infection, which aggravates the endothelial dysfunction observed in both T1DM and T2DM; and the hypercoagulability presented in COVID-19 infection that increases the thrombotic tendency in DM. CONCLUSION This review summarizes the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the co-existence of both pandemics as well as the current recommendations and future perspectives regarding optimal treatment of inpatients and outpatients with DM in the era of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, the current recommended drugs for the treatment of severe COVID-19, dexamethasone and remdesivir, may cause hyperglycemia, an adverse effect that physicians should bear in mind, when caring for patients with DM and COVID-19.","Vallianou, Natalia G; Evangelopoulos, Angelos; Kounatidis, Dimitris; Stratigou, Theodora; Christodoulatos, Gerasimos Socrates; Karampela, Irene; Dalamaga, Maria",Current diabetes reviews,588,29

Radical cystectomy is the standard treatment. However, due to surgery and postoperative complications, the quality of life of patients is seriously affected. Therefore, it is increasingly important to find prognostic markers and new therapeutic targets for MIBC. Here, we investigated the expression of PDK1, a key regulator of glucose metabolism, in bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA) and its effect on prognosis. The expression pattern of PDK1 was examined by bioinformatics analysis and immunohistochemistry. A total of 101 cases of BLCA were selected for tissue microarrays (TMAs) that contained both tumour and paired normal tissues. We demonstrated that PDK1 expression was correlated with tumour grade and Ki67expression in our TMA cohort (all p values < 0.05). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that patients with MIBC with high PDK1 expression had a worse prognosis than patients with low PDK1 expression (p = 0.016). Multifactor risk analysis showed that increased PDK1 expression was an independent prognostic factor affecting the overall survival of MIBC patients. GSEA showed that the mTOR pathway, HIF pathway, glycolysis, PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling, etc. were differentially enriched in the PDK1 high expression phenotype. Hence, PDK1 may be a prognostic and therapeutic target for MIBC.","Zhu, Jinfeng; Zheng, Guihua; Xu, Haifei; Jin, Xiaoxia; Tang, Ting; Wang, Xiaolin",Virchows Archiv : an international journal of pathology,588,1

Lethality in European territories and in territories of some nations with a non-temperate climate was also compared. MATERIALS AND METHODS Lethality was calculated as the rate of deaths in a determinate moment from the outbreak of the pandemic out of the total of identified positives for COVID-19 in a given area/nation, based on the COVID-John Hopkins University website. Lethality of countries located within the 5th parallels North/South on 6 April and 6 May 2020, was compared with that of all the other countries. Lethality in the European areas of The Netherlands, France and the United Kingdom was also compared to the territories of the same nations in areas with a non-temperate climate. RESULTS A lower lethality rate of COVID-19 was found in Equatorial countries both on April 6 (OR=0.72 CI 95% 0.66-0.80) and on May 6 (OR=0.48, CI 95% 0.47-0.51), with a strengthening over time of the protective effect. A trend of higher risk in European vs. non-temperate areas was found on April 6, but a clear difference was evident one month later: France (OR=0.13, CI 95% 0.10-0.18), The Netherlands (OR=0.5, CI 95% 0.3-0.9) and the UK (OR=0.2, CI 95% 0.01-0.51). This result does not seem to be totally related to the differences in age distribution of different sites. CONCLUSIONS The study does not seem to exclude that the lethality of COVID-19 may be climate sensitive. Future studies will have to confirm these clues, due to potential confounding factors, such as pollution, population age, and exposure to malaria.","Carta, M G; Scano, A; Lindert, J; Bonanno, S; Rinaldi, L; Fais, S; Orrù, G",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,588,1

The objective was to determine if TAP catheter provides additional analgesia compared with single-injection TAP block alone for kidney donors. METHODS In this prospective, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial, LLDN patients received a single TAP injection of 30 mL 0.2% ropivacaine and had a catheter inserted into the TAP space. Postoperatively, either 0.2% ropivacaine (TAP catheter group; TAP-C) or saline (TAP saline group; TAP-S) was infused at 10 mL/h. Pain scores, narcotic usage, nausea, and sedation were evaluated at 1, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 h. RESULTS The study population included 70 patients (35 randomly assigned to each group). No differences in pain scores, narcotic usage, nausea, or sedation were observed at any time point (with the exception of lower median pain score for TAP-S at 60 h; 3.2 versus 3.9 for TAP-C; P = .03). CONCLUSIONS The lower pain score for placebo group at 60 h postoperative is likely clinically insignificant. The TAP catheter infusion provided no benefit over a single-injection TAP block, thus the added risk and cost are not supported. Liposomal bupivacaine should be evaluated in future studies.","Yeap, Yar L; Wolfe, John W; Kroepfl, Elizabeth; Fridell, Jonathan; Powelson, John A",Clinical transplantation,588,1

Selection of the anti-microbial ELISA assays was guided by previous RNA sequencing studies that established a multiple sclerosis (MS) microbial candidate list. Microbial antigens included on the ELISA panel were derived from Akkermansia muciniphila, Atopobium vaginae, Bacteroides fragilis, Lactobacillus paracasei, Odoribacter splanchnicus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Cutibacterium (Propionibacterium) acnes, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Streptococcus mutans. Spinal fluid responses from patients with demyelinating diseases (DD, N=14) were compared to those with other neurological diseases (OND, N=8), and non-MS (Control, N=13) control patients. Commercial positive and negative control CSF specimens were run with each assay. ELISA Index values were derived for each specimen against each of the 10 bacterial antigen preparations. Intrathecal production of anti-microbial antibodies was assessed by comparing CSF and comparably diluted serum. CSF reactivity was significantly higher in the DD group compared to the controls against Akkermansia, Atopobium, Bacteroides, Lactobacillus, Odoribacter, and Fusobacterium. Four of the 11 tested DD group subjects had elevated antibody indexes against at least one of the 10 bacterial antigens, suggesting intrathecal production of anti-bacterial antibodies. This CSF serological study supports the hypothesis that several of the previously identified MS candidate microbes may contribute to demyelination in some patients.","Eckman, E.; Laman, J.; Fischer, K.; Lopansri, B.; Martins, T.; Hill, H.; Kriesel, J.

Chest X-ray (CXR) is a faster, widely available, and less expensive imaging modality that may be useful in predicting mortality in COVID-19 patients. Artificial Intelligence (AI) may help expedite CXR reading times, and improve mortality prediction. We sought to develop and assess an artificial intelligence system that used chest X-rays and clinical parameters to predict mortality in COVID-19 patients. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted in Ruby Hall Clinic, Pune, India. The study included patients who had a positive real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for COVID-19 and at least one available chest X-ray at the time of their initial presentation or admission. Features from CXR images and clinical parameters were used to train the Random Forest model. Results: Clinical data from a total of 201 patients was assessed retrospectively. The average age of the cohort was 51.4 {+/-} 14.8 years, with 29.4% of the patients being over the age of 60. The model, which used CXRs and clinical parameters as inputs, had a sensitivity of 0.83 [95% CI: 0.7, 0.95] and a specificity of 0.7 [95% CI: 0.64, 0.77]. The area under the curve (AUC) on receiver operating characteristics (ROC) was increased from 0.74 [95% CI: 0.67, 0.8] to 0.79 [95% CI: 0.72, 0.85] when the model included features of CXRs in addition to clinical parameters. Conclusion: An Artificial Intelligence (AI) model based on CXRs and clinical parameters demonstrated high sensitivity and can be used as a rapid and reliable tool for COVID-19 mortality prediction.","Nanivadekar, A.; Zirpe, K.; Dwivedi, A.; Patel, R.; Pant, R.; Gupte, T.; Lokwani, R.; Shende, D.; Kulkarni, V.; Kharat, A.",,588,1

The presence of delays degrades the performance of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, often to such an extent that algorithms fail to learn anything substantial. This paper formally describes the notion of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with stochastic delays and shows that delayed MDPs can be transformed into equivalent standard MDPs (without delays) with significantly simplified cost structure. We employ this equivalence to derive a model-free Delay-Resolved RL framework and show that even a simple RL algorithm built upon this framework achieves near-optimal rewards in environments with stochastic delays in actions and observations. The delay-resolved deep Q-network (DRDQN) algorithm is bench-marked on a variety of environments comprising of multi-step and stochastic delays and results in better performance, both in terms of achieving near-optimal rewards and minimizing the computational overhead thereof, with respect to the currently established algorithms.","Nath, Somjit; Baranwal, Mayank; Khadilkar, Harshad",,588,26

We used cell type-specific immunolabelings to characterize the lesions. The severity of the cerebellar cortex atrophy followed a general gradient from the midvermis toward the hemispheres and a local gradient from the depth of the folia toward their tip. Along these gradients, Purkinje cells were the first to disappear, followed by basket, Golgi, and stellate cells, and eventually by granule cells. Bergmann glia cells and unipolar brush cells were preserved. Pontine nuclei and the olivary complex were also severely depopulated.

Controversy about safety of MIS procedures during COVID-19 pandemic has been published. Nowadays, our priority should be create agreement in order to restart and organize MIS with safety conditions for patients and healthcare workers. METHODS: Pubmed and web search was conducted with following terms: ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""COVID19"", ""COVID19 Urology"", COVID19 Surgery"", ""COVID19 transmission"", ""SARS-CoV-2 transmission"", ""COVID19 nd minimally invasive surgery"", ""SARS-CoV-2 and CO 2insuflation"". A narrative review of available literature and scientific evidence summary was done. A modify nominal group technique was used to achieve an expert consensus. First draft was circulated amongst authors. Definitive document was approved in May 26th. RESULTS: Non evidence supports higher risk of SARSCoV-2 healthcare workers infection with MIS compared to open surgery. MIS is associated with shorter hospital stay than open surgery. Modify MIS indications to open surgery, with no scientific evidence, could spend valuable resources in detriment to COVID-19 patients. MIS indications should be prioritized attending to available resources and pandemic intensity. SARS-CoV-2screening 72 hours prior to surgery by clinical and epidemiological questionnaire and nasopharyngeal PCRis recommended, in order to prevent nosocomial transmission, professional infections and to minimize postoperative complications. Intraoperative steps should be established to reduce professional exposure to surgical aerosols, including: surgical room reorganization, adequate personal protective equipment, surgical technique optimization and management of CO2 and surgical smoke. CONCLUSIONS In COVID-19 pandemic de-escalation, MIS carried out with optimal safety measurements, could contribute to reduce hospital resources utilization. With current evidence, MIS should not be limited or reconverted to open surgery during COVID-19 pandemic.","Carracedo, David; Alcaraz, Antonio; Allona, Antonio; Gutierrez, José Luis; López-Fando, Luis; Medina, Rafael Antonio; Moncada, Ignacio; Moreno, Jesús; Palou, Joan; Pereira, Jose Gregorio; Ruibal, Manuel; Sánchez, María Dolores; Trilla, Enrique; Sánchez, Miguel",Archivos espanoles de urologia,588,12

The thermodynamics of folding of the MMTV vpk pseudoknot have been compared with a structurally homologous mutant RNA containing a G x U to G-C substitution at the helical junction (U13C RNA), and an A14 deletion mutation in that context (U13CdeltaA14 RNA). Dual wavelength optical melting and differential scanning calorimetry reveal that the unpaired adenosine contributes 0.7 (+/-0.2) kcal mol(-1) at low salt and 1.4 (+/-0.2) kcal mol(-1) to the stability (deltaG(0)37) at 1 M NaCl. This stability increment derives from a favorable enthalpy contribution to the stability deltadeltaH = 6.6 (+/-2.1) kcal mol(-1) with deltadeltaG(0)37 comparable to that predicted for the stacking of a dangling 3' unpaired adenosine on a G-C or G x U base pair. Group 1A monovalent ions, NH4+, Mg2+, and Co(NH3)6(3+) ions stabilize the A14 and deltaA14 pseudoknots to largely identical extents, revealing that the observed differences in stability in these molecules do not derive from a differential or specific accumulation of ions in the A14 versus deltaA14 pseudoknots. Knowledge of this free energy contribution may facilitate the prediction of RNA pseudoknot formation from primary nucleotide sequence (Gultyaev et al., 1999, RNA 5:609-617).","Theimer, C A; Giedroc, D P",RNA,588,1

It plays an important role in innate immunity in the lung and in mediating acute lung injury. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of mechanical ventilation on PTX3 expression in multiple lung injury models. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were challenged with intravenous injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or hemorrhage followed by resuscitation (HS). The animals were then subjected to either relatively higher (12 ml/kg) or lower (6 ml/kg, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH(2)O) volume ventilation for 4 h. High-volume ventilation significantly enhanced PTX3 expression in the lung, either alone or in combination with LPS or hemorrhage. A significant increase of PTX3 immunohistochemistry staining in the lung was seen in all injury groups. The PTX3 expression was highly correlated with the severity of lung injury determined by blood gas, lung elastance, and wet-to-dry ratio. To determine the effects of HS, LPS, or injurious ventilation (25 ml/kg) alone on PTX3 expression, another group of rats was studied. Injurious ventilation significantly damaged the lung and increased PTX3 expression. A local expression of PTX3 induced by high-volume ventilation, either alone or in combination with other pathological conditions, suggests that it may be an important mediator in ventilator-induced lung injury.","Okutani, Daisuke; Han, Bing; Mura, Marco; Waddell, Thomas K; Keshavjee, Shaf; Liu, Mingyao",American journal of physiology.

To understand local hepatic immune responses, the phenotypes of resident hepatic lymphocytes were determined and compared that of splenic and thymic T cell subpopulations during the acute viral hepatitis induced by MHV3 in susceptible C57BL/6 mice. Single positive (SP) CD4+ or CD8+ cells strongly increased in the liver. A specific cell population, the double positive (CD4+ C8+) cells, normally present in liver and thymic cell preparations, decreased in C57BL/6 mice following the viral infection. alpha beta-TcRintermediate T cells shifted toward alpha beta-TcRhigh T cells in the liver and thymus of infected mice, but not in their spleen. The specific alpha beta-TcRint or high lymphocytes occurring in the liver of MHV3-infected mice expressed higher levels of leukocyte function antigen-1 (LFA-1) and Pgp-1 (CD44) activation markers, suggesting that they were either activated or antigen-experienced during the viral infection. No significant changes in T cell subpopulations were detected in the spleen.

Typically, the dogs were coughing chronically, had dyspnoea and tachypnoea of varying severity, and had deteriorated progressively over months to years. The mean (sem) survival time in months from the clinical signs being first noted by the owners was 17.9 (2.3). Most cases had a combination of respiratory signs, but coughing was the predominant sign in 18 cases. Inspiratory crackles were audible on chest auscultation in 28 cases, 10 of which were also wheezing. Rhonchi were the predominant sound in the remaining case. The main radiographic changes were mild to severe increased Interstitial markings in all cases, with additional bronchial markings in 14 of the dogs. Right-sided cardiomegaly (cor pulmonale) was recorded in 15. Bronchoscopic findings in 17 of the dogs were either normal or involved a mild airway mucoid reaction in eight. Chronic mucosal changes were observed in eight, but in two this finding was equivocal. Dynamic changes to the lumen of the airway were present in seven cases. No significant haematological or biochemical changes could be detected in 20 cases, but four cases were hypercholestrolaemic. A histopathological assessment of four cases revealed alveolar septal fibrosis to be the predominant change. Prednisolone, with or without bronchodilators, was the most commonly used therapy, and the response was variable. The condition appears to be associated with significant pulmonary interstitial fibrosis of unknown aetiology and has clinical similarities to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis) in human beings.","Corcoran, B M; Cobb, M; Martin, M W; Dukes-McEwan, J; French, A; Fuentes, V L; Boswood, A; Rhind, S",The Veterinary record,588,1

METHODS: This is a prospective, observational, epidemiologic study in strict adherence to the ""STROBE"" (Strengthening The Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology) guidelines. It is a cross-sectional, multicentric study involving 5 tertiary neurosurgical centers to capture all public neurosurgical admissions in Queensland during the past 3 months (February-April, 2020) of significant public health policy changes to combat COVID-19. RESULTS: An analysis of the 1298 admissions for the Queensland population of 5.07 million Australians demonstrated a decrease in the number of elective and emergency admissions. The decline in elective admissions, particularly degenerative spine, benign neoplasms, and vascular pathologies, was a direct response of government strategy to curb activity to urgent surgical interventions only. Moreover, a trend toward fewer emergency admissions was also noted, partly explained by less trauma and also a decline in vascular pathologies including subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Remarkably, the severity of COVID-19 appears to rise with increasing body mass index (BMI). The association between COVID-19 outcomes and overweight/obesity has biological and physiological plausibility. Potential pathophysiological mechanisms that may explain this strong association include the chronic pro-inflammatory state, the excessive oxidative stress response, and the impaired immunity that is commonly reported in these individuals. The role of cytokines, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and altered natural killer cell polarization in the dangerous liaison between COVID-19 and obesity are discussed here. These pathways can favor and accelerate the deleterious downstream cellular effects of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, obesity is well known to be associated with reduced lung function and poor response to mechanical ventilation, thus placing these individuals at high risk of severe illness and mortality from COVID-19. Furthermore, obesity may lead to other complications, such as renal failure, cardiovascular dysfunction, hypertension, and vascular damage, which in turn can further accelerate negative clinical outcomes from COVID-19. Obese individuals should be shielded against any potential viral exposure to SARS-CoV-2 with consequential considerations for compulsory protection devices and social distancing. Health care providers should be aware that obesity predisposes to severe symptoms and negative prognosis in COVID-19 patients.","Caci, Grazia; Albini, Adriana; Malerba, Mario; Noonan, Douglas M.; Pochetti, Patrizia; Polosa, Riccardo",J.

While it has been proposed that cognitive control is needed to mediate this conflict between reward and our moral self-image, the exact role of cognitive control in (dis)honesty remains elusive. Here we identify this role, by investigating the neural mechanism underlying cheating. We developed a task which allows for inconspicuously measuring spontaneous cheating on a trial-by-trial basis in the MRI scanner. We found that activity in the nucleus accumbens promotes cheating, particularly for individuals who cheat a lot, while a network consisting of posterior cingulate cortex, temporoparietal junction, and medial prefrontal cortex promotes honesty, particularly in individuals who are generally honest. Finally, activity in areas associated with cognitive control (anterior cingulate cortex and inferior frontal gyrus) helped dishonest participants to be honest, whereas it enabled cheating for honest participants. Thus, our results suggest that cognitive control is not needed to be honest or dishonest per se but that it depends on an individual's moral default.","Speer, Sebastian P H; Smidts, Ale; Boksem, Maarten A S",Proc.

According to the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines, as an expert opinion, primary endocrine resistance is defined as relapse while on the first 2 years of adjuvant endocrine treatment (ET), or progressive disease (PD) within first 6 months of first-line ET for advanced breast cancer (ABC), while on ET. This definition is based on endocrine monotherapy used in the adjuvant and metastatic process. It is obvious that the concept of primary endocrine resistance defined by ESMO for adjuvant is still applicable. However, the concept of primary endocrine resistance defined for metastatic disease is no longer viable. We think that a new concept such as ""primary ET + CDK 4/6 resistance"" should be defined. Because the progression-free survival achieved with monotherapies in metastatic disease does not exceed 12 months, this period has reached 27 months with ET + CDK 4/6 inhibitors. We think that the 6 months defined for primary endocrine resistance in patients with ABC during endocrine monotherapy is too short for patients receiving ET + CDK 4/6 inhibitor. Therefore, the concept of novel primary ET + CDK 4/6 inhibitor resistance should be created to be used in patients with ABC.

The confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) were secondary analyses performed in two randomized controlled trial samples: consecutive breast cancer patients and distressed, mainly breast cancer patients. RESULTS: All translations showed comparable and reasonable factor structure results; however, the FCRI factor structure can be improved. The EFA resulted in a four-factor solution: fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) severity, cognitive coping, impact of FCR on functioning and behavioural coping. However, the 4-factor CFAs did not fit the sample 2 and 3 data well. CONCLUSION: Further exploring the FCRI-NL factor structure did not result in a psychometrically stronger FCRI-NL. Therefore, we recommend retaining the 7-factor FCRI-NL.","van Helmondt, Sanne Jasperine; van der Lee, Marije Liesbeth; Bisseling, Else Maria; Lodder, Paul; de Vries, Jolanda",Eur J Cancer Care (Engl),588,16

Our study aims to analyze the outcomes and risk factors from patients treated with ECMO. Methods: This retrospective, single-center study includes seventeen COVID-19 patients treated with ECMO. Univariate andmultivariate parametric survival regression identified predictors of survival. Result: Nine patients (53%) were successfully weaned from ECMO and discharged. The incidence of in-hospital mortalitywas 47%. In a univariate analysis, only four out of 83 pre-ECMO variables were significantly different;IL-6, PCT, and NT-proBNP were significantly higher in non-survivors compared with survivors. The Respiratory Extracorporeal MembraneOxygenation Survival Prediction (RESP) score was significantly lower in survivors. After a multivariate parametric survivalregression, IL-6, NT-proBNP and RESP scores remained significant independent predictors, with hazard ratios (HR) of 1.069[95% CI: 0.986-1.160], p = 0.016 1.001 [95% CI: 1.000-1.001], p = 0.012;and 0.843 [95% CI: 0.564-1.260], p = 0.040,respectively.

Substantial inter-individual variability in individual disease courses is hypothesized to be partially mediated by the differential regulation of the genes that interact with the SARS-CoV-2 virus or are involved in the subsequent host response. Here, we comprehensively investigated non-genetic and genetic factors influencing COVID-19-relevant bronchial epithelial gene expression. METHODS: We analyzed RNA-sequencing data from bronchial epithelial brushings obtained from uninfected individuals. We related ACE2 gene expression to host and environmental factors in the SPIROMICS cohort of smokers with and without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and replicated these associations in two asthma cohorts, SARP and MAST. To identify airway biology beyond ACE2 binding that may contribute to increased susceptibility, we used gene set enrichment analyses to determine if gene expression changes indicative of a suppressed airway immune response observed early in SARS-CoV-2 infection are also observed in association with host factors. To identify host genetic variants affecting COVID-19 susceptibility in SPIROMICS, we performed expression quantitative trait (eQTL) mapping and investigated the phenotypic associations of the eQTL variants. RESULTS: We found that ACE2 expression was higher in relation to active smoking, obesity, and hypertension that are known risk factors of COVID-19 severity, while an association with interferon-related inflammation was driven by the truncated, non-binding ACE2 isoform. We discovered that expression patterns of a suppressed airway immune response to early SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared to other viruses, are similar to patterns associated with obesity, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease, which may thus contribute to a COVID-19-susceptible airway environment. eQTL mapping identified regulatory variants for genes implicated in COVID-19, some of which had pheWAS evidence for their potential role in respiratory infections. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide evidence that clinically relevant variation in the expression of COVID-19-related genes is associated with host factors, environmental exposures, and likely host genetic variation.","Kasela, Silva; Ortega, Victor E; Martorella, Molly; Garudadri, Suresh; Nguyen, Jenna; Ampleford, Elizabeth; Pasanen, Anu; Nerella, Srilaxmi; Buschur, Kristina L; Barjaktarevic, Igor Z; Barr, R Graham; Bleecker, Eugene R; Bowler, Russell P; Comellas, Alejandro P; Cooper, Christopher B; Couper, David J; Criner, Gerard J; Curtis, Jeffrey L; Han, MeiLan K; Hansel, Nadia N; Hoffman, Eric A; Kaner, Robert J; Krishnan, Jerry A; Martinez, Fernando J; McDonald, Merry-Lynn N; Meyers, Deborah A; Paine, Robert; Peters, Stephen P; Castro, Mario; Denlinger, Loren C; Erzurum, Serpil C; Fahy, John V; Israel, Elliot; Jarjour, Nizar N; Levy, Bruce D; Li, Xingnan; Moore, Wendy C; Wenzel, Sally E; Zein, Joe; Langelier, Charles; Woodruff, Prescott G; Lappalainen, Tuuli; Christenson, Stephanie A",Genome Med,588,26

This necessitates a remote examination of such patients without sacrificing information quality. RESEARCH QUESTION: The goal of this study was to assess the feasibility of a 5G-based robot-assisted remote ultrasound system in examining patients with COVID-19 and to establish an examination protocol for telerobotic ultrasound scanning. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-three patients with COVID-19 were included and divided into two groups. Twelve were nonsevere cases, and 11 were severe cases. All patients underwent a 5G-based robot-assisted remote ultrasound system examination of the lungs and heart following an established protocol. Distribution characteristics and morphology of the lung and surrounding tissue lesions, left ventricular ejection fraction, ventricular area ratio, pericardial effusion, and examination-related complications were recorded. Bilateral lung lesions were evaluated by using a lung ultrasound score. RESULTS: The remote ultrasound system successfully and safely performed cardiopulmonary examinations of all patients. Peripheral lung lesions were clearly evaluated. Severe cases of COVID-19 had significantly more diseased regions (median [interquartile range], 6.0 [2.0-11.0] vs 1.0 [0.0-2.8]) and higher lung ultrasound scores (12.0 [4.0-24.0] vs 2.0 [0.0-4.0]) than nonsevere cases of COVID-19 (both, P < .05). One nonsevere case (8.3%; 95% CI, 1.5-35.4) and three severe cases (27.3%; 95% CI, 9.7-56.6) were complicated by pleural effusions. Four severe cases (36.4%; 95% CI, 15.2-64.6) were complicated by pericardial effusions (vs 0% of nonsevere cases, P < .05). No patients had significant examination-related complications. INTERPRETATION: Use of the 5G-based robot-assisted remote ultrasound system is feasible and effectively obtains ultrasound characteristics for cardiopulmonary assessment of patients with COVID-19. By following established protocols and considering medical history, clinical manifestations, and laboratory markers, this system might help to evaluate the severity of COVID-19 remotely.","Ye, Ruizhong; Zhou, Xianlong; Shao, Fei; Xiong, Linfei; Hong, Jun; Huang, Haijun; Tong, Weiwei; Wang, Jing; Chen, Shuangxi; Cui, Ailin; Peng, Chengzhong; Zhao, Yan; Chen, Legao",Chest,588,16

Hence, it is difficult to make an exclusive diagnosis. METHODS: Thirty confirmed cases of COVID-19 and forty-three cases of other aetiology or clinically confirmed non-COVID-19 in a general hospital were included. The clinical data including age, sex, exposure history, laboratory parameters and aetiological diagnosis of all patients were collected. Seven positive signs (posterior part/lower lobe predilection, bilateral involvement, rounded GGO, subpleural bandlike GGO, crazy-paving pattern, peripheral distribution, and GGO +/- consolidation) from significant COVID-19 CT image features and four negative signs (only one lobe involvement, only central distribution, tree-in-bud sign, and bronchial wall thickening) from other non-COVID-19 pneumonia were used. The scoring analysis of CT features was compared between the two groups (COVID-19 and non-COVID-19). RESULTS: Older age, symptoms of diarrhoea, exposure history related to Wuhan, and a lower white blood cell and lymphocyte count were significantly suggestive of COVID-19 rather than non-COVID-19 (p < 0.05). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the combined CT image features analysis revealed that the area under the curve (AUC) of the scoring system was 0.854. These cut-off values yielded a sensitivity of 56.67% and a specificity of 95.35% for a score > 4, a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 23.26% for a score > 0, and a sensitivity of 86.67% and a specificity of 67.44% for a score > 2. CONCLUSIONS: With a simple and practical scoring system based on CT imaging features, we can make a hierarchical diagnosis of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 with different management suggestions.","Luo, Lin; Luo, Zhendong; Jia, Yizhen; Zhou, Cuiping; He, Jianlong; Lyu, Jianxun; Shen, Xinping",BMC Pulm Med,588,26

The article deals with human rights and environmental violations arising from the construction of the Belo Monte Hydroelectric Power Plant in the northern region of Brazil. This paper aims to evidence human rights violations brought by the construction Belo Monte dam, a glimpse of the COVID-19 scenario and how Brazilian regulation allowed those violations. Design/methodology/approach: To achieve the objective of this article, the Brazilian norms, public policies and the current situation of the affected communities were analyzed, focusing on the human rights violations and the historical timeline of this mega-project. The analysis was directed to the hardcore social sciences, considering analytical and qualitative research. Findings: The data gathered and the references consulted proved that many human rights violations occurred and that the vulnerability of indigenous and local people increased with the construction of the Belo Monte Hydroelectric Power Plant in the northern region of Brazil. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated this adverse scenario since indigenous and local people already had their vulnerabilities increased with the construction of Belo Monte. Research limitations/implications: The Belo Monte Dam has had severe and irreversible impacts on the lives of local communities, especially indigenous peoples, as it had destroyed their culture and the environment. The authors were not able to do fieldwork, due to the great distance of the dam. In this sense, the research does not cover all the social–environmental issues, as an ethnographic approach is necessary. Originality/value: The authors intend to bring attention to harms caused to indigenous people and the local communities, expecting to create an alert of what this kind of project can do to vulnerable peoples' life, especially now with the pandemic scenario, which makes indigenous and traditional communities more vulnerable to diseases due to the loss of their territories.","Ribeiro, Heidi Michalski; Morato, Jose Rubens",Disaster Prev.

SARS-CoV-2 replication requires the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex, composed of non-structural proteins (nsp) 7, 8, and 12. Nsp 7 and 8 function as a primase, whereas nsp12 functions as RdRp for replication and transcription. This polymerase is the target of the antiviral drug remdesivir, an adenosine monophosphate analog. During RNA replication catalyzed by RdRp, remdesivir is covalently attached to the growing RNA strand, resulting in chain termination. Here, we designed a 3-dimensional (3D) model of the SARS-COV-2 nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 RdRp complex bound to template-primer double-stranded (ds)RNA and remdesivir using Jmol and PDB 7BV2 cryo-EM structure (Yin et al., 2020). The 3D model shows the nsp12 subunit bound to dsRNA template and growing RNA strand that forms a corkscrew-like structure within the center channel. The model highlights specific residues aspartic acid 760, valine557, and serine861 within the active site and the interactions of the template-primer RNA strands with remdesivir. An additional 3D model illustrates the structural similarity of remdesivir to adenosine monophosphate. These 3D models enable students to visualize complex biomolecules and understand mechanisms of therapeutics.","Davis, Michael Adams Valeanna Barnhill Serena Billings Ryan Brown LeShaundria Lauderdale Tra039; Mya, Karamba Ntirenganyi Van Stry Melanie Jones Carter Candace",The FASEB Journal,588,1

The P.1 variant was first identified in travelers from Brazil during routine airport screening in Tokyo, Japan, in early January 2021 (1). This variant has been associated with increased transmissibility (2), and there are concerns that mutations in the spike protein receptor-binding domain might disrupt both vaccine-induced and natural immunity (3,4). As of February 28, 2021, a total of 10 P.1 cases had been identified in the United States, including the two cases described in this report, followed by one case each in Alaska, Florida, Maryland, and Oklahoma (5).","Firestone, Melanie J; Lorentz, Alexandra J; Meyer, Stephanie; Wang, Xiong; Como-Sabetti, Kathryn; Vetter, Sara; Smith, Kirk; Holzbauer, Stacy; Beaudoin, Amanda; Garfin, Jacob; Ehresmann, Kristin; Danila, Richard; Lynfield, Ruth",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,588,20

The study examines the selection preferences by considering pair-wise non-bonded interaction energies of adjacent and interacting amino acids present at the interacting site, along with their evolutionary history. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For the study, variations in the interacting residues of spike protein (S-Protein) receptor-binding domain (RBD) of different coronaviruses were examined. The MD simulation trajectory analysis revealed that, though all the variants studied were structurally stable at their native and bound confirmations, the RBD of 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 was found to be more flexible and more dynamic. Furthermore, a noticeable change observed in the non-bonded interaction energies of the amino acids interacting with the receptor corroborated their selection at respective positions. KEY FINDINGS: The conformational changes exerted by the altered amino acids could be the reason for a broader range of interacting receptors among the selected proteins. SIGNIFICANCE: The results envisage a strong indication that the residue selection at certain positions is governed by a well-orchestrated feedback mechanism, which follows increased stability and flexibility in the folded structure compared to its evolutionary predecessor.","Rao, S J Aditya; Shetty, Nandini P",Life Sci,588,2

As the rate of infection starts to slow, healthcare facilities and economies attempt to return to normalcy in a graduated manner and the massive pent-up demand for surgeries needs to eventually be addressed in a systematic and equitable manner. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Guidelines from the Alliance of International Organizations of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, Orthopaedic Trauma Association, American College of Surgeons, American Society of Anaesthesiologists, Association of perioperative Registered Nurses, American Hospital Association, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were evaluated and summarized into a working framework, relevant to orthopaedic surgeons. RESULTS: The guiding principles for restarting elective surgeries in a safe and acceptable manner include up-to-date disease awareness, projection and judicious management of equipment and facilities, effective human resource management, a fair and transparent system to prioritize cases, optimization of peri-operative workflows and continuous data gathering and clinical governance. CONCLUSION: The world was ill prepared for the initial COVID-19 outbreak. However, with effective forward planning, institutions can ramp-up elective surgical caseload in a safe and equitable manner.","Ding, Benjamin Tze Keong; Tan, Kelvin Guoping; Oh, Jacob Yoong-Leong; Lee, Keng Thiam",Int J Surg,588,16

We set out to explore the efficacy and safety of Ivermectin in persons infected with COVID19. METHODS: We conducted a translational proof of concept (PoC) randomized, double blind placebo controlled, dose response, parallel group study of IV efficacy in RT - PCR proven COVID 19 positive patients. 62 patients were randomized to 3 treatment groups. (A) IV 6mg regime, (B)IV 12 mg regime (given Q84hrs for 2weeks) (C, control) Lopinavir/Ritonavir. All groups plus standard of Care. RESULTS: The Days to COVID negativity [DTN] was significantly and dose dependently reduced by IV (p = 0.0066). The DTN for Control were, = 9.1+/-5.2, for A 6.0 +/- 2.9, and for B 4.6 +/-3.2 . 2 Way repeated measures ANOVA of ranked COVID 19 +/- scores at 0, 84, 168, 232 hours showed a significant IV treatment effect (p = 0.035) and time effect (p < 0.0001).

They can be used as both a recognition element or/and as building blocks, template/scaffold. In this paper, we studied a bacteriophage selected through phage-display technology. The chosen bacteriophage acted as a building block for creating a carbon nanofiber-based electrode and as a new receptor/binding element that recognizes C-reactive protein (CRP) - one of the markers of inflammatory processes in the human body. The binding efficiency of the selected phage towards CRP is two orders of magnitude higher than in the wild type. We demonstrate that the phage-based sensor is selective against other proteins. Finally, we show that layer-by-layer methods are suitable for deposition of negatively charged phages (wild or CRP-binding) with positively charged carbon nanofibers for electrode surface modification. A three-layered electrode was successfully used for molecular recognition of CRP, and the molecular interactions were studied using electrochemical, biological, and optical methods, including microscopic and spectroscopic analyses.","Szot-Karpinska, Katarzyna; Kudla, Patryk; Szarota, Anna; Narajczyk, Magdalena; Marken, Frank; Niedziólka-Jönsson, Joanna",Bioelectrochemistry,588,20

Provide some initial diagnostic criteria using laboratory markers to stratify these patients. METHODS: This is a prospective observational study, 318 met the inclusion criteria. 64 patients (20.1%) were treated with HDCPT by using at least 1.5mg/kg/24h of methylprednisolone or dexamethasone equivalent. A multivariate Cox regression (controlling for co-morbidities and other therapies) was carried out to determine whether HDCPT (among other interventions) was associated with decreased mortality. We also carried out a 30-day time course analysis of laboratory markers between survivors and non-survivors, to identify potential markers for patient stratification. RESULTS: HDCPT showed a statistically significant decrease in mortality (HR = 0.087 [95% CI 0.021-0.36]; P < 0.001). 30-day time course analysis of laboratory marker tests showed marked differences in pro-inflammatory markers between survivors and non-survivors. As diagnostic criteria to define the patients at risk of developing a COVID-19 hyper-inflammatory response, we propose the following parameters (IL-6 > = 40 pg/ml, and/or two of the following: C-reactive protein > = 100 mg/L, D-dimer > = 1000 ng/ml, ferritin > = 500 ng/ml and lactate dehydrogenase > = 300 U/L). CONCLUSIONS: HDCPT can be an effective intervention to increase COVID-19 survival rates in patients at risk of developing a COVID-19 hyper-inflammatory response, laboratory marker tests can be used to stratify these patients who should be given HDCPT. This study is not a randomized clinical trial (RCT).

Allocating the workforce was necessary to meet the surging needs of the inpatient services due to the COVID-19 outbreak, which had the potential to compromise outpatient services. We present here our approach of restructuring clinical pharmacy services and providing direct patient care in outpatient clinics during the pandemic. DATA SOURCES: We conducted a retrospective review of electronic clinical documentation involving clinical pharmacy specialist patient encounters in 9 outpatient clinics from March 1, 2020 to May 31, 2020. The analysis of the clinical pharmacy specialist interventions and the impact of the interventions was descriptive. DATA SUMMARY: As hospital services were modified to handle the surge due to COVID-19, select clinical pharmacy specialists were redeployed from the outpatient clinics or research blocks to COVID-19 inpatient teams. During these 3 months, clinical pharmacy specialists were involved in 2535 patient visits from 9 outpatient clinics and contributed a total of 4022 interventions, the majority of which utilized telemedicine. The interventions provided critical clinical pharmacy care during the pandemic and omitted 199 in-person visits for medical care.

Recent studies report no effect of (H)CQ on 28-day mortality. We investigated the effect of HCQ and CQ in hospitalized patients on the non-ICU COVID-ward. METHODS: A nationwide, observational cohort study was performed in The Netherlands. Hospitals were given the opportunity to decide independently on the use of three different COVID-19 treatment strategies: HCQ, CQ, or no treatment. We compared the outcomes between these groups. The primary outcomes were 1) death on the COVID-19 ward, and 2) transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU). RESULTS: The analysis included 1064 patients from 14 hospitals: 566 patients received treatment with either HCQ (n = 189) or CQ (n = 377), and 498 patients received no treatment. In a multivariate propensity-matched weighted competing regression analysis, there was no significant effect of (H)CQ on mortality on the COVID ward. However, HCQ was associated with a significantly decreased risk of transfer to the ICU (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.47, 95% CI = 0.27-0.82, p = 0.008) when compared with controls. This effect was not found in the CQ group (HR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.55-1.15, p = 0.207). CONCLUSION: The results of this observational study demonstrate a lack of effect of (H)CQ on non-ICU mortality. However, we show that the use of HCQ - but not CQ - is associated with a 53% reduction in risk of transfer of COVID-19 patients from the regular ward to the ICU. Recent prospective studies have reported on 28-day, all-cause mortality only; therefore, additional prospective data on the early effects of HCQ in preventing transfer to the ICU are still needed.","Lammers, A J J; Brohet, R M; Theunissen, R E P; Koster, C; Rood, R; Verhagen, D W M; Brinkman, K; Hassing, R J; Dofferhoff, A; El Moussaoui, R; Hermanides, G; Ellerbroek, J; Bokhizzou, N; Visser, H; van den Berge, M; Bax, H; Postma, D F; Groeneveld, P H P",Int J Infect Dis,588,20

Without prior notice, they had to switch from traditional education to virtual teaching. This study's objective was to identify the perception of students and professors of the Bachelor in the English Language from the University of Chihuahua, Mexico, during the transition to virtual classes due to the pandemic. Researchers applied a survey of 28 items with a Likert scale to 152 students during the spring semester 2020 and the second instrument of 51 items to 26 professors. The students reported having complications in connectivity (21%) and difficulties interacting with professors and classmates (34%). Many students reported experiencing anxiety (69.1%) and feeling isolated (62.5%). Most agree that they learn better in face-to-face classes (85%). In turn, the professors agree that the students had a lower performance than in a face-to-face semester (69.3%). Despite this, the professors affirm that they followed the program to the letter (92.3%) and completed the programmed contents (84.6%). Besides, 92.3% of the academics are confident to face a new semester in virtual modality, if necessary. Although we can say that the transition from face-to-face to virtual classes in the institution was successful, students and professors encountered difficulties and disadvantages in the use of platforms for online classes. The benefit of this research's findings is understanding the University must have all the necessary elements in place for online teaching. It must establish a formal regulation of virtual programs that includes professor's and student's profile, as well as the strategies to be followed.

Our study examined the association of plasma TMAO level with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS: Patients who were at least 18 years-old and received HD for at least 6 months were enrolled within 6 months. Patients with coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, arrhythmia, or stroke within 3 months before study onset were excluded. The primary endpoints were cardiovascular and all-cause death, and the secondary endpoint was cerebrovascular death. RESULTS: We recruited 252 patients and divided them into a high-TMAO group (>4.73 µg/mL) and a low-TMAO group (&#8804;4.73 µg/mL). The median follow-up time was 73.4 months (interquartile range: 42.9, 108). A total of 123 patients died, 39 from cardiovascular disease, 19 from cerebrovascular disease, and 65 from other causes. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that the high-TMAO group had a greater incidence of cardiovascular death (Log-Rank: p = 0.006) and all-cause death (Log-Rank: p < 0.001). Cox regression analysis showed that high TMAO level was significantly associated with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. After adjustment for confounding, this association remained significant for cardiovascular mortality (TMAO as a continuous variable: HR: 1.18, 95%CI: 1.07, 1.294, p < 0.001; TMAO as a dichotomous variable: HR: 3.44, 95%CI: 1.68, 7.08, p < 0.001) and all-cause mortality (TMAO as a continuous variable: HR: 1.14, 95%CI: 1.08, 1.21, p < 0.001; TMAO as a dichotomous variable: HR: 2.54, 95%CI: 1.71, 3.76, p < 0.001).

It is not yet clear whether the tendency to thrombosis is increased in the mild-to-moderate course of COVID-19. Our research aims to show the clinical benefit of Q-SPECT/CT in diagnosing PD in outpatients treated with mild-to-moderate course of COVID-19 and to determine the frequency of perfusion defects in these patients having relatively lower risk. METHODS: All patients who underwent Q-SPECT/CT with suspicion of embolism were examined retrospectively. Only patients with low clinical probability and mild-to-moderate course of COVID-19 for PE were included in the study. The patients were evaluated comparatively as those with and without perfusion defects. Patients were divided into laboratory suspicion, clinical suspicion, or clinical and laboratory suspicion. RESULTS: In outpatients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 with low clinical probability for PE, PD without CT abnormality was detected with a rate of 36.6% with Q-SPECT/CT performed for complaints of high D-dimer and/or dyspnea. None of the patients had PD at more proximal level than the segment level. PD with no concomitant CT abnormality was observed with a rate of 56.5% in patients with both clinical and laboratory suspicion.

This study aimed to determine the patient demographics, risk factors including comorbidities, and medications used to treat COVID-19, presenting symptoms and signs, and the outcome of management. Methods: This was a retrospective, observational study of patients with COVID-19-associated ROCM managed or co-managed by ophthalmologists in India from January 1, 2020 to May 26, 2021. Results: Of the 2826 patients, the states of Gujarat (22%) and Maharashtra (21%) reported the highest number of ROCM. The mean age of patients was 51.9 years with a male preponderance (71%). While 57% of the patients needed oxygen support for COVID-19 infection, 87% of the patients were treated with corticosteroids, (21% for > 10 days). Diabetes mellitus (DM) was present in 78% of all patients. Most of the cases showed onset of symptoms of ROCM between day 10 and day 15 from the diagnosis of COVID-19, 56% developed within 14 days after COVID-19 diagnosis, while 44% had delayed onset beyond 14 days. Orbit was involved in 72% of patients, with stage 3c forming the bulk (27%). Overall treatment included intravenous amphotericin B in 73%, functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS)/paranasal sinus (PNS) debridement in 56%, orbital exenteration in 15%, and both FESS/PNS debridement and orbital exenteration in 17%. Intraorbital injection of amphotericin B was administered in 22%. At final follow-up, mortality was 14%. Disease stage >3b had poorer prognosis. Paranasal sinus debridement and orbital exenteration reduced the mortality rate from 52% to 39% in patients with stage 4 disease with intracranial extension (p < 0.05). Conclusion: : Corticosteroids and DM are the most important predisposing factors in the development of COVID-19-associated ROCM. COVID-19 patients must be followed up beyond recovery. Awareness of red flag symptoms and signs, high index of clinical suspicion, prompt diagnosis, and early initiation of treatment with amphotericin B, aggressive surgical debridement of the PNS, and orbital exenteration, where indicated, are essential for successful outcome.","Sen, Mrittika; Honavar, Santosh G; Bansal, Rolika; Sengupta, Sabyasachi; Rao, Raksha; Kim, Usha; Sharma, Mukesh; Sachdev, Mahipal; Grover, Ashok K; Surve, Abhidnya; Budharapu, Abhishek; Ramadhin, Abhishek K; Tripathi, Abhishek Kumar; Gupta, Adit; Bhargava, Aditya; Sahu, Animesh; Khairnar, Anjali; Kochar, Anju; Madhavani, Ankita; Shrivastava, Ankur K; Desai, Anuja K; Paul, Anujeet; Ayyar, Anuradha; Bhatnagar, Aparna; Singhal, Aparna; Nikose, Archana Sunil; Bhargava, Arun; Tenagi, Arvind L; Kamble, Ashish; Nariani, Ashiyana; Patel, Bhavin; Kashyap, Bibbhuti; Dhawan, Bodhraj; Vohra, Busaraben; Mandke, Charuta; Thrishulamurthy, Chinmayee; Sambare, Chitra; Sarkar, Deepayan; Mankad, Devanshi Shirishbhai; Maheshwari, Dhwani; Lalwani, Dilip; Kanani, Dipti; Patel, Diti; Manjandavida, Fairooz P; Godhani, Frenali; Agarwal, Garima Amol; Ravulaparthi, Gayatri; Shilpa, Gondhi Vijay; Deshpande, Gunjan; Thakkar, Hansa",Indian J Ophthalmol,588,16

COVID-19 has important impacts on the environment as anthropic interventions to nature has been largely reduced after almost all countries implemented partial or complete blockade to curb the spread of the virus. Up to now, a series of studies have focused on the relationship between COVID-19 and the environment from different cities. In this review, we summarized the latest data on the correlation between COVID-19 and environmental changes. As a result, imposing necessary restrictions can help suppress the virus chain while improving air quality in some countries. The significant reduction in NO2 emission, PM2.5 level and other hazardous factors reflected the promising consequence of the efforts made during the lockdown period. It is, sometimes dark clouds have silver linings. It is worth noting that along with these positive outcomes, secondary pollutants such as ozone, however, remained unchanged or even increased significantly. Additionally, medical wastes and plastics pollutants would be increased substantially. The extensive use of masks in daily life and other medical materials is bound to increase the burden of waste disposal and environmental degradation. For the general public, in addition to the physical lesions caused by SARS-CoV-2, confirmed/suspected cases and even the normal group may suffer from mental problems. Based on those mentioned impacts, the way forward depends largely on our attitude and decision. It is indispensable to assess potential deleterious effects and to take preventive measures in time to respond to the post-pandemic era. In this way, potential silver linings will not become temporary.","Wang, Yan; Xue, Qingwang",NanoImpact,588,28

We aimed to characterize unit culture differences at hospitals that successfully reduced their cesarean rates compared with those that did not. METHODS: A mixed methods study of California hospitals participating in a statewide initiative to reduce cesarean delivery. Participants included nurses, obstetricians, family physicians, midwives, and anesthesiologists practicing at participating hospitals. Hospitals' net change in nulliparous, term, singleton, and vertex cesarean delivery rates classified them as successful if they achieved either a minimum 5 percentage point reduction or rate of fewer than 24%. The Labor Culture Survey was used to quantify differences in unit culture. Key informant interviews were used to explore quantitative findings and characterize additional cultural barriers and facilitators. RESULTS: Out of 55 hospitals, 37 (n = 840 clinicians) meeting inclusion criteria participated in the Labor Culture Survey. Physicians' individual attitudes differed by hospital success on 5 scales: best practices (P = .003), fear (P = .001), cesarean safety (P = .014), physician oversight (P <.001), and microculture (P = .044) scales. Patient ability to make informed decisions showed poor agreement across all hospitals, but was higher at successful hospitals (38% vs 29%, P = .01). Important qualitative themes included: ease of access to shared resources on best practices, fear of bad outcomes, personal resistance to change, collaborative practice and effective communication, leadership engagement, and cultural flexibility. CONCLUSIONS: Successful hospitals' culture and context was measurably different from nonresponders.

The spectrum of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is variable, and amongst its manifestations are neurological implications. Objective: This report aimed to describe electroencephalographic findings in COVID-19 patients from a general tertiary hospital in São Paulo, Brazil. Methods: It was a retrospective, observational, and non-interventional study. Data were collected anonymously, comprising inpatients from Mar 1 to Jun 30, 2020, either confirmed (positive RT-PCR) or probable cases (CO-RADS 4/5) who had performed EEG during hospitalization. Results: Twenty-eight patients were enrolled, 17 (60.7%) women and 11 men, with a median age of 58 (minimum and maximum: 18-86; IQR 23.5). COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed in 22 (78.5%). Twenty-one patients (75%) had severe disease, requiring mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); 16 (57.1%) patients developed adjunct sepsis throughout hospitalization. There was no specific pattern found for COVID-19 in EEG. No patients presented with status epilepticus or electrographic events; most patients developed an encephalopathic pattern, as seen in most studies, with a high prevalence of altered mental status as an indication for EEG. Adjunct sepsis was associated with higher mortality. Conclusions: EEG presents as a useful tool in the context of COVID-19, as in other conditions, to differentiate nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) from encephalopathy and other causes of mental status alterations.

The high levels of stress experienced by nurses during this pandemic may have immediate and long-term effects on their mental health. PURPOSE: To explore the stress and psychological problems of nurses during this pandemic and to identify strategies used by these nurses to relieve stress. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted that included a basic information datasheet, stress of nursing staff during COVID-19 outbreak scale, psychological distress scale, and stress relief methods survey form. Convenience sampling was used and a total of 469 practicing nurses participated in this study. RESULTS: Most of the participants expressed concerns about living problems (72.7%). On the stress questionnaire, the facets of ""burden of taking care of patients"" and ""worries about social isolation"" earned the first and second highest scores, respectively. In terms of items, ""worrying about infecting family members and friends"" and ""worrying about being separated from family after being infected"" earned the two highest scores (2.35 ± 0.79 and 2.17 ± 0.92, respectively). Scores for psychological distress averaged 5.49 ± 3.83, with stress anxiety (1.32 ± 0.84) earning the highest mean subscale score followed by distress and irritability (1.17 ± 0.92) and depression (1.12 ± 0.94).

Barishal division is the ‘grain-basket’ of Bangladesh and a main rice cultivation centre within the country. This study captures perspectives on the environmental socioeconomic stressors impacting primary production in the coastal region of Barishal, and the impact of the first wave of the global pandemic. In our methodology, a cross-sectional survey is carried out amongst agriculture officers and farmers focusing on land management practices, environmental stressors, and the consequences of the pandemic on winter crop harvests and wet season production. A total number of 234 people participated, of which 31 were agriculture officers and 203 were farmers. Government officers completed an online questionnaire, while farmer responses were collected through Focus Group Discussion. The results show that despite the lockdown, 76% of responders claimed that they had harvested more than 80% of the cultivated winter rice. Other crops, such as fruits and vegetables, were less successfully returned. Despite food production pressures, land capacity was not fully utilised, with a significant/notable proportion of fields left fallow, principally due to periodic flooding events that sufferer concurrently from soil organic matter depletion. Upazila, not severely waterlogged, had salinity problems to contend with. While transportation restrictions and labour shortages were key constraints arising from the impact of COVID-19 on both agricultural production and post harvesting (processing, distribution, and utilisation). Current storage facilities for perishable produce, such as fruit, were found to be lacking, which further compounded access to such food items. The COVID-19 pandemic shocked agricultural productivity and food supply within the Barishal division. However, despite managing to return a successful rice harvest during the lockdown, it was found that the pre-existing environmental stressors arising from cyclones and flooding continued to be the primary threat to agriculture, even during a global pandemic. Our findings have been used to inform management options to increase resilience in the region.","Sayeda, Sabrina Ali Md Raju Ahmad Jalal Uddin Mohammad Shoaib Sheik Mohammad Aliuzzaman Mohammad Imam Hoshain Hall Rebecca L.; Macintosh, Katrina A.; Williams, Paul N.",Sustainability,588,16

Based on this, we aimed to show the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of this drug molecule via in vitro, in silico, and molecular techniques. Ribavirin showed antiviral activity in Vero E6 cells following SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas the drug itself did not show any toxic effect over the concentration range tested. In silico analysis suggested that ribavirin has a broad-spectrum impact on SARS-CoV-2, acting at different viral proteins. According to the detailed molecular techniques, ribavirin was shown to decrease the expression of TMPRSS2 at both mRNA and protein levels 48 h after treatment. The suppressive effect of ribavirin in ACE2 protein expression was shown to be dependent on cell types. Finally, proteolytic activity assays showed that ribavirin also showed an inhibitory effect on the TMPRSS2 enzyme. Based on these results, we hypothesized that ribavirin may inhibit the expression of TMPRSS2 by modulating the formation of inhibitory G-quadruplex structures at the TMPRSS2 promoter. As a conclusion, ribavirin is a potential antiviral drug for the treatment against SARS-CoV-2, and it interferes with the effects of TMPRSS2 and ACE2 expression.","Unal, Mehmet Altay; Bitirim, Ceylan Verda; Summak, Gokce Yagmur; Bereketoglu, Sidar; Cevher Zeytin, Inci; Besbinar, Omur; Gurcan, Cansu; Aydos, Dunya; Goksoy, Ezgi; Kocakaya, Ebru; Eran, Zeynep; Murat, Merve; Demir, Nil; Aksoy Ozer, Zeynep Busra; Somers, Julia; Demir, Emek; Nazir, Hasan; Ozkan, Sibel Aysil; Ozkul, Aykut; Azap, Alpay; Yilmazer, Acelya; Akcali, Kamil Can",Can J Physiol Pharmacol,588,10

Characterizing return to baseline health among outpatients with milder COVID-19 illness is important for understanding the full spectrum of COVID-19-associated illness and tailoring public health messaging, interventions, and policy. During April 15-June 25, 2020, telephone interviews were conducted with a random sample of adults aged &#8805;18 years who had a first positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, at an outpatient visit at one of 14 U.S. academic health care systems in 13 states. Interviews were conducted 14-21 days after the test date. Respondents were asked about demographic characteristics, baseline chronic medical conditions, symptoms present at the time of testing, whether those symptoms had resolved by the interview date, and whether they had returned to their usual state of health at the time of interview. Among 292 respondents, 94% (274) reported experiencing one or more symptoms at the time of testing; 35% of these symptomatic respondents reported not having returned to their usual state of health by the date of the interview (median = 16 days from testing date), including 26% among those aged 18-34 years, 32% among those aged 35-49 years, and 47% among those aged &#8805;50 years. Among respondents reporting cough, fatigue, or shortness of breath at the time of testing, 43%, 35%, and 29%, respectively, continued to experience these symptoms at the time of the interview. These findings indicate that COVID-19 can result in prolonged illness even among persons with milder outpatient illness, including young adults.

We aimed to ascertain whether social distancing; difficulty with daily activities; and levels of concern regarding COVID-19 changed after the March 16, 2020 announcement of the nation's first shelter-in-place orders (SIPO) among individuals living in the seven affected counties in the San Francisco Bay Area. METHODS: We conducted an online, cross-sectional social media survey from March 14 -April 1, 2020. We measured changes in social distancing behavior; experienced difficulties with daily activities (i.e., access to healthcare, childcare, obtaining essential food and medications); and level of concern regarding COVID-19 after the March 16 shelter-in-place announcement in the San Francisco Bay Area versus elsewhere in the U.S. RESULTS: In this non-representative sample, the percentage of respondents social distancing all of the time increased following the shelter-in-place announcement in the Bay Area (9.2%, 95% CI: 6.6, 11.9) and elsewhere in the U.S. (3.4%, 95% CI: 2.0, 5.0). Respondents also reported increased difficulty obtaining hand sanitizer, medications, and in particular respondents reported increased difficulty obtaining food in the Bay Area (13.3%, 95% CI: 10.4, 16.3) and elsewhere (8.2%, 95% CI: 6.6, 9.7). We found limited evidence that level of concern regarding the COVID-19 crisis changed following the announcement. CONCLUSION: This study characterizes early changes in attitudes, behaviors, and difficulties. As states and localities implement, rollback, and reinstate shelter-in-place orders, ongoing efforts to more fully examine the social, economic, and health impacts of COVID-19, especially among vulnerable populations, are urgently needed.","Elser, Holly; Kiang, Mathew V; John, Esther M; Simard, Julia F; Bondy, Melissa; Nelson, Lorene M; Chen, Wei-Ting; Linos, Eleni",PLoS One,588,2

Data was collated on breed, sex, age, number of cats at original location, outdoor access, health status, and time spent in the shelter prior to sampling (range 0 to 4 years). Some cats were also tested for feline leukaemia virus antigen, feline immunodeficiency virus, and Toxoplasma gondii antibodies. The effect of these variables on FCoV seropositivity was explored by multivariable logistic regression. FCoV seropositivity in cats that had spent 5 days or less in a shelter at sampling was significantly associated with a multi-cat origin, cats aged 3 years or less, and Persian breed. Whether pet, stray or feral, health status, indoor/outdoor access, and sex had no significant effect. Overall FCoV seropositivity was associated with time spent in a shelter but this association was not linear. Cats that had spent more than 60 days in a shelter were over five times as likely to be seropositive. This may be the result of a change in husbandry from solitary to communal housing for cats remaining in shelters long term. Rescue of cats for less than 60 days was not associated with a significant increasing risk of seropositivity. Significant variation existed in seropositivity between individual shelters overall and in cats rescued for less than 5 days. These findings may reflect inter-shelter variation in cat husbandry and variation in seropositivity of shelter intake respectively.","Cave, Thomas A.; Golder, Matthew C.; Simpson, Joyce; Addie, Diane D.",J Feline Med Surg,588,16

Precedent evidence suggests that deficiency of the element zinc can be associated with similar complications as well as impaired antiviral response. Herein, beyond determining the zinc status, we explore the association between the plasma zinc concentration, the development of CRS, and the clinical outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Methods We conducted a prospective, single-center, observational study in a tertiary university hospital (CUB-Hopital Erasme, Brussels). Hospitalized adult patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled within 72 hours of hospital admission. We assessed the presence and severity of COVID-19-associated hyperinflammatory syndrome (cHIS), an additive six-point clinical scale that we independently validated in the current study. We defined the clinical outcomes as the length of hospitalization, the incidence of mechanical ventilation, and mortality. We recorded the outcomes with a follow-up of 90 days from hospital admission. Results One hundred and thirty-nine eligible patients were included between May 2020 and November 2020 (median age of 65 years [IQR, 54 to 77]). Our cohort's mean plasma zinc concentration was 56.2 mcg/dL (standard deviation [SD], 14.8). The absolute majority of patients (96%) were zinc deficient (<80mcg/dL). The mean plasma zinc concentration was lower in patients with CRS (cHIS [greater double equals] 2)compared to those without CRS (-5 mcg/dL; 95% CI, -10.5 to 0.051; p = 0.048). We observed that the plasma zinc concentration is weakly but significantly correlated with the length of hospital stay (rho = -0.19; p = 0.022). However, the plasma zinc concentration was not significantly associated with the risk of mortality or morbidity. Conclusions Markedly, an absolute majority of hospitalized COVID-19 patients are zinc deficient. We found no significant association between zinc plasma concentration and cHIS. We find a weak (reverse) correlation between plasma zinc concentration and the length of hospital stay, but not with mortality or morbidity. As such, our findings do not support the role of zinc as a robust prognostic factor among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. We encourage further studies to explore the role of zinc as a biomarker for assessing the risk of developing a tissue-damaging CRS and predicting outcomes in patients diagnosed with COVID-19.","Verschelden, G.; Noeparast, M.; Noparast, M.; Michel, C.; Cotton, F.; Goyvaerts, C.; Hites, M.",,588,23

COVID-19 vaccination programme success will rely on public willingness to be vaccinated. Methods: We used a multi-methods approach - involving an online cross-sectional survey and semi-structured interviews - to investigate parents' and guardians' views on the acceptability of a future COVID-19 vaccine. 1252 parents and guardians (aged 16+ years) who reported living in England with a child aged 18 months or under completed the survey. Nineteen survey respondents were interviewed. Findings: Most participants reported they would definitely accept or were unsure but leaning towards accepting a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves (Definitely 55.8%; Unsure but leaning towards yes 34.3%) and their child/children (Definitely 48.2%; Unsure but leaning towards yes 40.9%). Less than 4% of participants reported that they would definitely not accept a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves or their child/children. Participants were more likely to accept a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves than for their child/children. Participants that self-reported as Black, Asian, Chinese, Mixed or Other ethnicity were almost 3 times more likely to reject a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves and their children than White British, White Irish and White Other participants. Respondents from lower income households were also more likely to reject a COVID-19 vaccine. The main reason for vaccine acceptance was for self-protection from COVID-19. Common concerns were around COVID-19 vaccine safety and effectiveness, which were largely prompted by the newness and rapid development of the vaccine. Conclusion: To alleviate concerns, information on how COVID-19 vaccines are developed and tested, including their safety and efficacy, must be communicated clearly to the public. To prevent inequalities in uptake, it is crucial to understand and address factors that may affect COVID-19 vaccine acceptability in ethnic minority and lower-income groups who are disproportionately affected by COVID-19.","Bell, Sadie L; Clarke, Richard; Mounier-Jack, Sandra; Walker, Jemma L; Paterson, Pauline",,588,16

This essay, written in the aftermath of the January 6, 2021 vigilante anti-democratic white supremacist assault on the US Capitol, calls attention to the two-edged sword of data at play, reflecting long histories of support for and opposition to white supremacy and scientific racism. As illustrated by both past and present examples, including COVID-19, at issue are both the non-use (Edge #1) and problematic use (Edge #2) of data on racialized groups. Recognizing that structural problems require structural solutions, in this essay I propose a new two-part institutional mandate regarding the reporting and analysis of publicly-funded work involving racialized groups and health data and documentation as to why the proposed mandates are feasible. Proposal/part 1 is to implement enforceable requirements that all US health data sets and research projects supported by government funds must explicitly explain and justify their conceptualization of racialized groups and the metrics used to categorize them. Proposal/part 2 is that any individual-level health data by membership in racialized groups must also be analyzed in relation to relevant data about racialized societal inequities. A new opportunity arises as US government agencies re-engage with their work, out of the shadow of white grievance politics cast by the Trump Administration, to move forward with this structural proposal to aid the work for health equity.","Krieger, Nancy",Front Public Health,588,16

Interventions to enable people to better cope with such distress should be based on the best available evidence. We therefore performed a scoping review to systematically identify and summarize the available literature of interventions that target the distress of people in the face of highly contagious disease outbreaks. METHODS: MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL, Web of Science (January 2000 to May 7, 2020), and reference lists were systematically searched and screened by two independent reviewers. Quantitative and qualitative studies investigating the effects of psychological interventions before, during, and after outbreaks of highly contagious emerging infectious diseases, such as SARS, MERS, Ebola, or COVID-19 were included. Study effects were grouped (e.g. for healthcare professionals, community members, people at risk) and intervention contents at the individual and organizational level summarized. We assessed the level of evidence using a modified scheme from the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine and the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council. RESULTS: Of 4030 records found, 19 studies were included (two RCTs). Most interventions were delivered during-exposure and face-to-face, focused on healthcare workers and crisis personnel, and combined psychoeducation with training of coping strategies. Based on two high-quality studies, beneficial effects were reported for resilience factors (e.g. positive cognitive appraisal) and professional attitudes of healthcare workers, with mixed findings for mental health (e.g. depression). Across all studies, there was positive qualitative feedback from participants and facilitators. We identified seven ongoing studies mostly using online- and mobile-based deliveries. CONCLUSIONS: There is preliminary evidence for beneficial effects of interventions to enable people to better cope with the distress of highly contagious emerging disease outbreaks. Besides the need for more high-quality studies, the summarized evidence may inform decision makers to plan interventions during the current pandemic and to develop pandemic preparedness plans.","Kunzler, Angela M.; Stoffers-Winterling, Jutta; Stoll, Marlene; Mancini, Alexander L.; Lehmann, Sophie; Blessin, Manpreet; Gilan, Donya; Helmreich, Isabella; Hufert, Frank; Lieb, Klaus",PLoS One,588,22

The present study characterized post-transcriptional gene regulation by global microRNA (miRNA) expression in relation to activated coagulation and inflammation in 21 critically ill SARS-CoV-2 patients. The cohort consisted of patients with moderate respiratory failure (n = 11) and severe respiratory failure (n = 10) at an acute stage (day 0–3) and in the later course of the disease (>7 days). All patients needed supplemental oxygen and severe patients were defined by the requirement of positive pressure ventilation (intubation). Levels of D-dimers, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), C-reactive protein (CRP), and interleukin (IL)-6 were significantly higher in patients with severe compared with moderate respiratory failure. Concurrently, next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis demonstrated increased dysregulation of miRNA expression with progression of disease severity connected to extreme downregulation of miR-320a, miR-320b and miR-320c. Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis revealed involvement in the Hippo signaling pathway, the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling pathway and in the regulation of adherens junctions. The expression of all miR-320 family members was significantly correlated with CRP, IL-6, and D-dimer levels. In conclusion, our analysis underlines the importance of thromboembolic processes in patients with respiratory failure and emphasizes miRNA-320s as potential biomarkers for severe progressive SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Duecker, Ruth P.; Adam, Elisabeth H.; Wirtz, Sarah; Gronau, Lucia; Khodamoradi, Yascha; Eberhardt, Fabian J.; Donath, Helena; Gutmann, Desiree; Vehreschild, Maria J.
