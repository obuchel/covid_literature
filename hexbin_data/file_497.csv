In this article, we assess the safety issues associated with immunomodulatory biologics and discuss the current approaches for predicting and mitigating adverse reactions associated with their use. We also outline how these approaches can inform the development of safer immunomodulatory biologics.

When administered intraperitoneally in divided doses, significant protection from death was conferred at doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg/day given 24 and 17 h pre-virus inoculation, 25–100 mg/kg/day administered 4 h pre- and 3 h post-virus challenge, and 12.5 to 100 mg/kg/day administered 24 and 31 h after virus inoculation. These doses preventing death reduced liver icterus scores, serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels, and liver and serum virus titers relative to placebo controls. Full daily doses administered at 24 h were somewhat less protective to mice than divided daily doses starting at the same time. The initiation of treatment could be delayed as late as 36 h after virus inoculation, resulting in complete protection from mortality at 100 mg/kg/day. This prevention of death occurred despite the acute nature of the infection which resulted in deaths by 96 h in the placebo-treated controls. These results show that 7-thia-8-oxoguanosine has both prophylactic and therapeutic potential as an anti-Phlebovirus agent. Interferon induction appears to be the reason for antiviral activity in this model, since up to 10000 units of interferon/ml were induced in mice 1 h after treatment with 100 mg 7-thia-8-oxoguanosine per kg, and antibody to interferon α/β administered shortly after treatment with the nucleoside negated the antiviral effect.","Smee, Donald F.; Huffman, John H.; Gessaman, Ann C.; Huggins, John W.; Sidwell, Robert W.",Antiviral Res,497,4

These group-level properties emerged from the interactions between cells in a group, and determined the selection pressures experienced by these cells. We investigate the evolution of multicellularity with an evolutionary model where cells search for resources by chemotaxis in a shallow, noisy gradient. Cells can evolve their adhesion to others in a periodically changing environment, where a cell’s fitness solely depends on its distance from the gradient source. We show that multicellular aggregates evolve because they perform chemotaxis more efficiently than single cells. Only when the environment changes too frequently, a unicellular state evolves which relies on cell dispersal. Both strategies prevent the invasion of the other through interference competition, creating evolutionary bi-stability. Therefore, collective behaviour can be an emergent selective driver for undifferentiated multicellularity.","Colizzi, Enrico Sandro; Vroomans, Renske MA; Merks, Roeland MH",,497,15

The ethyl acetate extract of the fungal culture filtrates displayed promising antimicrobial activity against a panel of clinically significant pathogens including Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Bioassay guided purification of the organic extract using column and thin layer chromatography yielded a pure homogenous compound which was identified using spectroscopic methods (essentially by (1)H NMR and MS) as tyrosol, a well-known phenylethanoid present in several natural sources. Besides, molecular docking studies against tyrosyl tRNA synthetases (TyrRS) of S. aureus (PDB ID: 1JIL) and E. coli (PDB ID: 1VBM), and CYP45014α-lanosterol demethylase (CYP51) of C. albicans (PDB ID: 5FSA) revealed tyrosol has a strong binding affinity with the enzyme active site residues. The fungus was identified as Colletotrichum sp. and characterized by its genomic ITS rDNA and ITS2 sequences. Phylogenetic analyses showed clustering of our isolate with Colletotrichum coccodes. Species of Colletotrichum are also reported to be plant pathogens. Therefore, to confirm the endophytic lifestyle of the isolate, ITS2 RNA secondary structure study was undertaken. The result indicated our isolate exhibited differences in the folding pattern as well as in motif structures when compared to those of pathogenic C. coccodes. The findings indicated that endophytic fungi harboring H. cordata could be explored as a potent source of antimicrobial agents.","Talukdar, Rajreepa; Padhi, Srichandan; Rai, Amit K.; Masi, Marco; Evidente, Antonio; Jha, Dhruva Kumar; Cimmino, Alessio; Tayung, Kumananda",Front Bioeng Biotechnol,497,4

Related researches range from annotation tasks description to emotions detection tools. Visualisation of such emotions is traditionally carried out using the most popular layouts, as bar plots or tables, which are however sub-optimal. The classic representation of the Plutchik’s wheel follows the principles of proximity and opposition between pairs of emotions: spatial proximity in this model is also a semantic proximity, as adjacent emotions elicit a complex emotion (a primary dyad) when triggered together; spatial opposition is a semantic opposition as well, as positive emotions are opposite to negative emotions. The most common layouts fail to preserve both features, not to mention the need of visually allowing comparisons between different corpora in a blink of an eye, that is hard with basic design solutions. We introduce PyPlutchik the Pyplutchik package is available as a Github repository (http://github.com/alfonsosemeraro/pyplutchik) or through the installation commands pip or conda.

Notably, PyPlutchik allows users to display also primary, secondary, tertiary and opposite dyads in a compact, intuitive way. We substantiate our claim that PyPlutchik outperforms other classic visualisations when displaying Plutchik emotions and we showcase a few examples that display our module’s most compelling features.","Semeraro, Alfonso; Vilella, Salvatore; Ruffo, Giancarlo",PLoS One,497,4

In the clinic, anti-programmed cell death protein 1/programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have progressed to first-line monotherapies in certain tumor types. However, the efficacy of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 mAbs is still limited due to toxic side effects and de novo or adaptive resistance. Moreover, other immune checkpoint target and biomarkers for therapeutic response prediction are still lacking; as a biomarker, the PD-L1 (CD274, B7-H1) expression level is not as accurate as required. Hence, it is necessary to seek more representative predictive molecules and potential target molecules for immune checkpoint therapy. Fibrinogen-like protein 1 (FGL1) is a proliferation- and metabolism-related protein secreted by the liver. Multiple studies have confirmed that FGL1 is a newly emerging checkpoint ligand of lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG3), emphasizing the potential of targeting FGL1/LAG3 as the next generation of immune checkpoint therapy. In this review, we summarize the substantial regulation mechanisms of FGL1 in physiological and pathological conditions, especially tumor epithelial to mesenchymal transition, immune escape and immune checkpoint blockade resistance, to provide insights for targeting FGL1 in cancer treatment.","Qian, Wenjing; Zhao, Mingfang; Wang, Ruoyu; Li, Heming",J Hematol Oncol,497,4

With an aim to tackle liver cirrhosis, a life-threatening disease, trials of autologous bone marrow cell infusion (ABMi) therapy started in 2003. Clinical studies revealed that ABMi attenuated liver fibrosis and improved liver function in some patients; however, this therapy has some limitations such as the need of general anesthesia. Following ABMi therapy, studies have focused on specific cells such as mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from a variety of tissues such as bone marrow, adipose tissue, and umbilical cord tissues. Particularly, studies have focused on gaining mechanistic insights into MSC distribution and effects on immune cells, especially macrophages. Several basic studies have reported the use of MSCs for liver cirrhosis models, while a number of clinical studies have used autologous and allogeneic MSCs; however, there are only a few reports on the obvious substantial effect of MSCs in clinical studies. Since then, studies have analyzed and identified the important signals or components in MSCs that regulate immune cells, such as macrophages, under cirrhotic conditions and have revealed that MSC-derived exosomes are key regulators. Researchers are still seeking the best approach and filling the gap between basic and clinical studies to treat liver cirrhosis. This paper highlights the timeline of basic and clinical studies analyzing ABMi and MSC therapies for cirrhosis and the scope for future studies and therapy.","Terai, Shuji; Tsuchiya, Atsunori; Watanabe, Yusuke; Takeuchi, Suguru",Inflamm Regen,497,4

Current preventive strategies are not sufficient at all, and available therapeutic drugs are very limited. Indeed, genetic variations of viruses can impair the efficacy of antiviral compounds by the apparition of resistance. Moreover, current delay needed for de novo development of drugs does not allow a rapid response in case of important epidemic or pandemic events. In this context, new therapeutic approaches are necessary. An innovative concept is to repurpose already marketed compounds that can reverse the host cellular transcriptomic response to the infection. By targeting the host, these molecules exhibit a broad-spectrum activity and are potentially effective even against new emergent strains. This strategy implements the characterization of specific host gene expression profiles, the in silico screening of drugs, and their validation in in vitro and in vivo models, until their evaluation in clinical trials.

Firstly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of using traditional retrieval models against the Boolean search of documents in chronological order. In an attempt to capture the complex information needs of users, a learning to rank approach is adopted with user specified relevance criteria as features. This approach, however, only achieves mediocre results compared to the traditional models. However, we find that by fine-tuning a contextualised language model (e.g. BERT), significantly improved retrieval performance can be achieved, providing a flexible solution to satisfying complex information needs without explicit feature engineering.","Sanchez, Luis; He, Jiyin; Manotumruksa, Jarana; Albakour, Dyaa; Martinez, Miguel; Lipani, Aldo",Advances in Information Retrieval,497,4

The chapter describes the diversity of virus genomes, and explains the major genetic mechanisms that affect viruses. The chemistry and structures of virus genomes are more varied than any of those seen in the entire bacterial, plant, or animal kingdoms. Virus genome structures and nucleotide sequences have been intensively studied in the recent decades because the power of recombinant DNA technology has focused a lot of attention in this area. The techniques of molecular biology have been a major influence on the virus genome. It is possible to separate the molecular analysis of virus genomes into two types of approaches: the physical analysis of structure and nucleotide sequence, and a more biological approach to examine the structure–function relationships of intact virus genomes and individual genetic elements. The chapter discusses virus genetics and its mutants, genetic and nongenetic interactions among viruses, small and large DNA genomes, positive and negative-strand RNA viruses, and segmented and multipartite virus genomes. Sequences and structures at the ends of virus genomes are in some ways functionally more significant than the unique coding regions within them. Common patterns of genetic organization seen in virus super-families suggest that many viruses have evolved from common ancestors and that exchange of genetic information among viruses has resulted in solutions to common problems.","Cann, Alan J.",Principles of Molecular Virology,497,4

Mice of all ages can be infected by the EDIM virus but overt disease is restricted to animals up to about 12–13 days of age at the time of first exposure. The EDIM virus is worldwide in distribution.

The acute disease of reovirus 3 infection affects mainly sucklings and weanlings, whereas the chronic disease is encountered in animals over 28 days of age. The MHV virus, on the other hand, has been found to affect cotton rats, rats, and hamsters.","Kraft, Lisbeth M.",Diseases,497,4

Most current and past molecular surveillance studies of animal diseases investigated spatio-temporal and evolutionary dynamics of the viruses in a disjointed analytical framework, ignoring many uncertainties and made joint conclusions from both analytical approaches. Phylodynamic methods offer a uniquely integrated platform capable of inferring complex epidemiological and evolutionary processes from the phylogeny of viruses in populations using a single Bayesian statistical framework. In this study, we reviewed and outlined basic concepts and aspects of phylodynamic methods and attempted to summarize essential components of the methodology in one analytical pipeline to facilitate the proper use of the methods by animal health researchers. Also, we challenged the robustness of the posterior evolutionary parameters, inferred by the commonly used phylodynamic models, using hemagglutinin (HA) and polymerase basic 2 (PB2) segments of the currently circulating human-like H3 swine influenza (SI) viruses isolated in the United States and multiple priors. Subsequently, we compared similarities and differences between the posterior parameters inferred from sequence data using multiple phylodynamic models. Our suggested phylodynamic approach attempts to reduce the impact of its inherent limitations to offer less biased and biologically plausible inferences about the pathogen evolutionary characteristics to properly guide intervention activities. We also pinpointed requirements and challenges for integrating phylodynamic methods in routine animal disease surveillance activities.","Alkhamis, Moh A.; Li, Chong; Torremorell, Montserrat",Front Vet Sci,497,4

Most acute respiratory failure patients use a full face (oronasal) mask with noninvasive ventilation, which is known to impair communication, but its popularity and benefit has led many providers to accept the communication impairment. Medical staff periodically remove masks to communicate with patients, but patients are often limited to short utterances and risk lung derecruitment upon removal of positive pressure. These problems can lead to noninvasive ventilation failure, which is often linked to worse outcomes than first initiating invasive mechanical ventilation and can lead to increased hospitalization costs. DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE and Google Scholar for “speech,” “communication,” “impairment,” “failure,” “complications,” “NIPPV,” “NIV,” and “noninvasive ventilation.” STUDY SELECTION: We included articles with patients in acute respiratory failure. We excluded articles for patients using noninvasive ventilation therapy for obstructive sleep apnea. DATA SYNTHESIS: Communication impairment has been associated with increasing noninvasive ventilation anxiety (odds ratio, 1.25). Of patients using noninvasive ventilation, 48% require early discontinuation, 22% refuse noninvasive ventilation, and 9% are ultimately intubated. Improvements to communication have been shown to reduce fear and anxiety in invasive mechanical ventilation patients. Analogous communication problems exist with effective solutions in other fields, such as fighter pilot masks, that can be easily implemented to enhance noninvasive ventilation patient care, increase adherence to noninvasive ventilation treatment, and improve patient outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Communication impairment is an underappreciated cause of noninvasive ventilation complications and failure and requires further characterization. Analogous solutions—such as throat microphones and mask-based microphones—that can be easily implemented show potential as cost-effective methods to reduce noninvasive ventilation failure.","Wong, An-Kwok Ian; Cheung, Patricia C.; Happ, Mary Beth; Gay, Peter C.; Collop, Nancy A.",Crit Care Explor,497,4

Tree-level planar scattering amplitudes of the theory can be obtained from a weighted sum of the canonical forms of the accordiohedra. In this paper, using results of the recent work [3], we show that in theories with polynomial interactions all the weights can be determined from the factorization property of the accordiohedron. We also extend the projective recursion relations introduced in [4, 5] to these theories. We then give a detailed analysis of how the recursion relations in ϕ(p) theories and theories with polynomial interaction correspond to projective triangulations of accordiohedra.

For example, we can control the virus propagation in an epidemiological network by controlling the behavior of such influential nodes, and amplify the information propagation in a social network by using them as a maximizer. Many indexing methods have been proposed in the literature to identify the influential spreaders in a network. Nevertheless, we have notice that each individual network holds different connectivity structures that we classify as complete, incomplete, or in-between based on their components and density. These affect the accuracy of existing indexing methods in the identification of the best influential spreaders. Thus, no single indexing strategy is sufficient from all varieties of network connectivity structures. This article proposes a new indexing method Network Global Structure-based Centrality (ngsc) which intelligently combines existing kshell and sum of neighbors’ degree methods with knowledge of the network’s global structural properties, such as the giant component, average degree, and percolation threshold. The experimental results show that our proposed method yields a better spreading performance of the seed spreaders over a large variety of network connectivity structures, and correlates well with ranking based on an SIR model used as ground truth. It also out-performs contemporary techniques and is competitive with more sophisticated approaches that are computationally cost.","Namtirtha, Amrita; Dutta, Animesh; Dutta, Biswanath; Sundararajan, Amritha; Simmhan, Yogesh",Sci Rep,497,25

COVID-19 posed increased challenges in terms of analgesia choice and altered follow-up arrangements. This study aimed to assess adherence to the care pathway and improve patient care. METHODOLOGY: We retrospectively analysed all acute traumatic anterior shoulder dislocations at the MTC in Bristol. We collected data during 01/04/2019-31/05/2019 and 01/04/2020-31/05/2020 to analyse the quality of their management. Data parameters collated included examinations and imaging performance, choice of analgesia, follow-up rates, and physiotherapy referrals. RESULTS: We identified 32 patients in 2019, and 24 in 2020. Full neurovascular examinations pre- and post-reduction were poorly documented. Peri-reduction imaging utilization was near 100%. Referral to follow-up was 88% in 2019 but 38% in 2020. Of those assessed in clinic during COVID-19, fewer were mobilised early or referred to outpatient physiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: We have created a proforma/prompt to improve the quality of the management of these injuries, and successfully liaised with the Emergency Department for this to be included in their documentation.

This retrospective audit aims to ascertain if a policy of two valid group and save tests prior to transurethral prostate surgery is necessary and if this resource can be redistributed safely during the ongoing pandemic. METHODS: A retrospective review of electronic patient records for patients that underwent transurethral prostate surgery from June 2017 to June 2018. During a single admission for surgery it was identified how many pre-operative group and save tests, and if a post-operative blood transfusion patients underwent. RESULTS: 146 patients underwent transurethral prostate surgery between June 2017 to June 2018. 97 patients had two valid group and save tests prior to surgery. 49 patients did not have 2 valid group and save tests. 21 patients had expired tests, 20 had only one valid sample, and 8 had no group and save test at all. No patient underwent a blood transfusion during their admission for transurethral prostate surgery. CONCLUSION: This single centre study illustrates pre-operative group and save tests before transurethral prostate surgery are unnecessary as no patient required an associated blood transfusion during admission; and can safely be omitted. The clinical time and resource could be redirected elsewhere for greater patient benefit. £2855.00 of efficiency savings could be made foregoing unneeded group and save tests.

The interaction between SARS‐CoV‐2 spike protein and host cell proteins is the first and decisive step in establishing a COVID‐19 infection. This fact inspired us to create ViruClear, a molecularly designed biomimetic proteolipid bilayer decoy receptor nanosponge (100 nm nanospheres) containing an optimal combination of receptors and factors used by SARS‐CoV‐2 to bind host cells. Antiviral medicine (and most vaccines) often target a single viral target and may be rendered ineffective as the virus accumulates mutations and escapes treatments. By contrast, ViruClear nanosponges display as “decoys” the same set of receptors and factors that the SARS‐CoV‐2 depend on for cellular entry and infection. As such, the ViruClear platform is agnostic to viral mutations and potentially viral variant species, as long as the entry receptors overlap with those of SARS‐CoV‐2. Our preliminary data validate that the ViruClear decoy can multivalently trap viral particles and neutralize SARS‐CoV‐2 infections in animal and human cells. ViruClear is a novel “game changing” decoy receptor nanosponge optimized for multivalent capture of SARS‐CoV‐2 in the body (IV injection) or as a preventive measure in nebulized formats (e.g., molecular PPE). Its preclinical and clinical translation will lead paradigm shifts in countermeasures against SARS‐CoV‐2 and other viruses.","Esmaeli‐Azad, Babak; Federico, Isabella; Rojas, Fernando; Zapf, Jim",FASEB J,497,4

METHODS: We drew on our experience over the past decade with CLHSs as well as qualitative literature review to answer three questions: What kind of phenomena are CLHSs? and what is an appropriate scientific approach? How might we frame CLHSs conceptually? What are potential mechanisms of action? RESULTS: CLHSs are complex adaptive systems in which all stakeholders are able to collaborate, at scale, to create and share resources to satisfy a variety of needs. This is accomplished by providing infrastructure and services that enable stakeholders to act on their inherent motivations. This framing has implications for both research and practice.

Consideration of these risks and potential benefits are necessary when deciding to transfuse. Patient blood management (PBM) guidelines exist to assist in clinical decision-making, but they are underutilised. Exploration of barriers to the implementation and utilisation of the PBM guidelines is required. This study aimed to identify common barriers and implementation strategies used to implement PBM guidelines, with a comparison against current expert opinion. METHODS A restricted review approach was used to identify the barriers to PBM guideline implementation as reported by health professionals and to review which implementation strategies have been used. Searches were undertaken in MEDLINE/PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Scopus and the Cochrane library. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) was used to code barriers. The Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC) tool was used to code implementation strategies, and subsequently, develop recommendations based on expert opinion. RESULTS We identified 14 studies suitable for inclusion. There was a cluster of barriers commonly reported: access to knowledge and information (n = 7), knowledge and beliefs about the intervention ( = 7) and tension for change (n = 6). Implementation strategies used varied widely (n = 25). Only one study reported the use of an implementation theory, model or framework. Most studies (n = 11) had at least 50% agreement with the ERIC recommendations. CONCLUSIONS There are common barriers experienced by health professionals when trying to implement PBM guidelines.

However, because of its large size and shape, it is difficult to perform intubation compared with a single lumen tube. The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to determine whether the McGrath videolaryngoscope has any advantage over the direct Macintosh laryngoscope for DLT intubation in patients with a simulated difficult airway. METHODS Forty-four patients (19-60 years of age); scheduled to undergo general anesthesia with one-lung ventilation were assigned to 1 of 2 groups: DLT intubation with the McGrath videolaryngoscope (ML group [n = 22]); or conventional Macintosh laryngoscope (DL group [n = 22]). After manual in-line stabilization was applied as a way of simulating a difficult airway, the time required for intubation and the quality of glottic view were evaluated. RESULTS The time to successful intubation was not different between the 2 groups (ML group, 45 s [interquartile range, 38-52 s] versus DL group, 54 s [45-59 s]; P = .089). The McGrath videolaryngoscope, however, provided a significantly better glottic view. Modified Cormack and Lehane grade was better (P < .001), and the percentage of glottis opening score was higher in the ML group (P < .001). Overall intubation difficulty scale score was lower in the ML group (1 [0-2]) versus the DL group (3 [2-4]) (P < .001). CONCLUSION The McGrath videolaryngoscope improved glottic view and resulted in lower overall intubation difficulty scale score in patients with in-line stabilization.","Yoo, Ji Young; Park, Sung Yong; Kim, Jong Yeop; Kim, Myungseob; Haam, Seok Jin; Kim, Dae Hee",Medicine,497,1

Stem cell-based therapies are a particularly attractive option for the treatment of intractable lung diseases for which current therapies are essentially palliative. Proof-of-principle experiments in animal models demonstrate the efficacy of exogenous stem cells in mediating lung repair by attenuating fibrotic responses to injury, but also suggest that their ability to contribute to lung epithelial regeneration and repair is limited. Consequently, attention has turned to endogenous lung stem cells as targets or vehicles for the delivery of lung regenerative therapies. In this article, we discuss the potential and promise of endogenous lung stem cells in regenerative medicine, and the problems and challenges faced by researchers and clinicians in harnessing their potential to repair the lung.","Bertoncello, Ivan; McQualter, Jonathan L",Expert review of respiratory medicine,497,26

Methods In the current COVID-19 pandemic, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients have a potentially higher risk of complications from this infectious disease due to the use of immunosuppressant and/or biologic treatments and due to flares of this chronic illness, which often require urgent care and sometimes hospitalization. Moreover, patients undergoing biologic intravenous (IV) treatment visit the hospital for scheduled IV infusions. Discussion In hospitals like ours, where COVID-19 patients are treated, the organization of ""clean circuits"" is essential to minimize the risks of infection for non-COVID-19 patients, such as patients in IBD infusion units. In our hospital, the IBD infusion unit is located within the gastroenterology department, which, under normal circumstances, is very advantageous for patients but in the current context is not. Our goal was to maximize adherence to biologic IV treatment and clinical safety at a time of profound changes in gastroenterology activity and in a department with daily increases in the number of COVID-19 patients. Conclusion To this end, we initiated proactive COVID-19 testing in IBD patients undergoing biologic IV treatment and changed the location of the infusion unit to a ""COVID-free"" institution, maintaining the care of these patients by the dedicated IBD team of our department. The purpose of this report is to show that a patient-centered care strategy allowed us to reach very high levels of patient comfort, satisfaction, and compliance with therapeutics.","Lago, Paula; Caetano, Cidalina; Ferreira, Daniela; Salgado, Marta; Pedroto, Isabel",GE Portuguese journal of gastroenterology,497,7

Prior reviews have adopted a disorder-specific focus. However, trauma is a risk factor for most psychiatric conditions. We adopted a transdiagnostic approach to evaluate the efficacy of MBIs for the consequences of trauma, agnostic to diagnosis. AMED, CINAHL, Central, Embase, Pubmed/Medline, PsycINFO, and Scopus were searched to 30 September 2018 for controlled and uncontrolled trials of mindfulness, yoga, tai chi, and qi gong in people specifically selected for trauma exposure. Of >12,000 results, 66 studies were included in the systematic review and 24 controlled studies were meta-analyzed. There was a significant, pooled effect of MBIs (g = 0.51, 95%CI 0.31 to 0.71, p < .001). Similar effects were observed for mindfulness (g = 0.45, 0.26 to 0.64, p < .001), yoga (g = 0.46, 0.26 to 0.66, p < .001), and integrative exercise (g = 0.94, 0.37 to 1.51, p = .001), with no difference between interventions. Outcome measure or trauma type did not influence the effectiveness, but interventions of 8 weeks or more were more effective than shorter interventions (Q = 8.39, df = 2, p = .02). Mindfulness-based interventions, adjunctive to treatment-as-usual of medication and/or psychotherapy, are effective in reducing trauma-related symptoms. Yoga and mindfulness have comparable effectiveness. Many psychiatric studies do not report trauma exposure, focusing on disorder-specific outcomes, but this review suggests a transdiagnostic approach could be adopted in the treatment of trauma sequelae with MBIs. More rigorous reporting of trauma exposure and MBI treatment protocols is recommended to enhance future research.","Taylor, Jennifer; McLean, Loyola; Korner, Anthony; Stratton, Elizabeth; Glozier, Nicholas",Journal of trauma & dissociation : the official journal of the International Society for the Study of Dissociation,497,0

To minimise this risk, UK Armed Forces (UKAF) recruits receive a prevention-focused dental care intervention during military training (known as 'Project MOLAR') before their entry to the trained strength of the Armed Forces.Aim To evaluate whether Project MOLAR is effective in preventing future dental emergency events and subsequent oral disease in UKAF recruits.Methods This is a retrospective cohort analysis of UKAF recruits who enlisted between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2011, conducted by analysing electronic primary dental care records. Adverse outcomes were defined as: i) incidence of dental emergency events during the five-year follow-up period; and ii) further oral disease at 18 months measured by an increase in Decayed, Missing and Filled Teeth (DMFT).Results In total, 7,361 recruits met the inclusion criteria. The total follow-up time for the cohort was 31,957 person-years (mean follow-up 4.3 years/recruit). Individuals whose treatment was completed under Project MOLAR were found to experience a 30% reduction in dental emergency incidence (RR: 0.70-95% CI: 0.63-0.76) (p <0.001) and a 64% reduction in the odds of DMFT increase at 18 months (OR: 0.36-95% CI: 0.28-0.47) (p <0.001) compared to individuals whose treatment was incomplete.Conclusions Defence dentistry's focus on delivering prevention-focused dentistry early in a recruit's military career confers a downstream benefit to personnel who complete the intervention, such that dental emergency occurrences and DMFT progression are significantly reduced.","Armstrong, Sarah; Dermont, Mark",British dental journal,497,16

High intensity aerobic exercise has been shown to enhance connectivity between basal ganglia nuclei and cortical areas, including the SMA. The aim of this project was to determine the effects of high intensity lower extremity exercise on motor control patterns underlying a manual dexterity task. METHODS PD participants completed eight weeks of high intensity aerobic exercise under forced or voluntary exercise (FE or VE) modalities. Grasping forces for each limb were quantified during a functional bimanual dexterity task. Data were collected while OFF antiparkinsonian medication at baseline, end of treatment (EOT), and eight weeks after exercise cessation (EOT+8). RESULTS Eight weeks of high intensity exercise improved MDS-UPDRS Motor III clinical ratings by more than 4 points (~15%) for the FE and VE groups. Time to complete the task decreased nearly 30% across both groups as well. The control and coordination of grasping forces, simultaneity of force initiation, and rate of grip and load force exhibited significant improvements following exercise. In general, improvements in biomechanical outcomes were sustained following exercise cessation. CONCLUSION High intensity aerobic exercise, achieved via a forced or voluntary mode, improved PD symptoms and bimanual dexterity. Sustained improvement of upper extremity motor control following exercise cessation indicates high intensity exercise enhances CNS functioning and suggests exercise may be a candidate for altering PD progression.","Jansen, A Elizabeth; Koop, Mandy Miller; Rosenfeldt, Anson B; Alberts, Jay L",Parkinsonism & related disorders,497,5

METHODS The medical records of infants under 2 years of age who underwent operation for a CCAM from 2009 to 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS MIS (9 of thoracoscopy and 1 of laparoscopy) was performed for 10 infants (male:female = 7:3) with CCAM. CCAM were discovered prenatally around gestational age of 24.7 weeks. The median gestational age was 38.6 weeks, and the median body weight was 2,817.5 g. None had respiratory distress after birth. The median age at the time of operation was 0.94 years (range: 8 days-1.66 years). Two underwent the operation during the neonatal period; one because of a coexisting large esophageal duplication cyst and the other due to diagnostic uncertainty. While awaiting operation, 5 of CCAM had grown without respiratory symptoms, and 2 infants had experienced pneumonia. The mean operative time was 98 minutes (range: 70-227 minutes), and there were no conversions or perioperative complications. The infants resumed enteral feeding within 2 days and were discharged within 7 days, except for 1 infant who underwent esophageal duplication cyst excision. During the follow-up period, there were no cases of either remnant lesions or respiratory symptoms. CONCLUSION MIS for CCAMs is safe and feasible, with excellent cosmesis and short hospital stays. Increasing experience with various MIS procedures will widen the indications for MIS in lung pathology.","Nam, So Hyun; Cho, Min Jeong; Kim, Dae Yeon",Annals of surgical treatment and research,497,1

OBJECTIVES This study sought to describe VT ablation results and identify factors associated with arrhythmia recurrences in a cohort of patients with myocarditis. METHODS The authors enrolled 125 consecutive patients with myocarditis, undergoing VT ablation. Before ablation, disease stage was evaluated, to identify active (AM) versus previous myocarditis (PM). The primary study endpoint was assessment of VT recurrences by 12-month follow-up. Predictors of VT recurrences were retrospectively identified. RESULTS All patients (age 51 ± 14 years, 91% men, left ventricular ejection fraction 52% ± 9%) had history of myocarditis diagnosed by endomyocardial biopsy (59%) and/or cardiac magnetic resonance (90%). Furthermore, all had multiple episodes of drug-refractory VTs. Multimodal pre-procedural staging identified 47 patients with AM (38%) and 78 patients with PM (62%). All patients showed low-voltage areas (LVA) at electroanatomical map (97% epicardial or endoepicardial); of them, 25 (20%) had wide borderzone (WBZ, constituting >50% of the whole LVA). VT recurrences were documented in 25 patients (20%) by 12 months, and in 43 (34%) by last follow-up (median 63 months; interquartile range: 39 to 87). At multivariable analysis, AM stage was the only predictor of VT recurrences by 12 months (hazard ratio: 9.5; 95% confidence interval: 2.6 to 35.3; p < 0.001), whereas both AM stage and WBZ were associated with arrhythmia recurrences anytime during follow-up. No VT episodes were found after redo ablation was performed in 23 patients during PM stage. CONCLUSION Our findings suggest that VT ablation should be avoided during AM, but is often of benefit for recurrent VT after the acute phase of myocarditis.","Peretto, Giovanni; Sala, Simone; Basso, Cristina; Rizzo, Stefania; Radinovic, Andrea; Frontera, Antonio; Limite, Luca Rosario; Paglino, Gabriele; Bisceglia, Caterina; De Luca, Giacomo; Campochiaro, Corrado; Sartorelli, Silvia; Palmisano, Anna; Esposito, Antonio; Busnardo, Elena; Villatore, Andrea; Baratto, Francesca; Cireddu, Manuela; Marzi, Alessandra; D'Angelo, Giuseppe; Gulletta, Simone; Vergara, Pasquale; De Cobelli, Francesco; Dagna, Lorenzo; Mazzone, Patrizio; Della Bella, Paolo",Journal of the American College of Cardiology,497,31

We investigated the safety and efficacy of D-SOC with electrohydraulic and laser lithotripsy in an international, multicenter study of patients with difficult biliary stones. METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis of 407 patients (60.4% female; mean age, 64.2 years) who underwent D-SOC for difficult biliary stones at 22 tertiary centers in the United States, United Kingdom, or Korea from February 2015 through December 2016; 306 patients underwent electrohydraulic lithotripsy and 101 (24.8%) underwent laser lithotripsy. Univariate and multivariable analyses were performed to identify factors associated with technical failure and the need for more than 1 D-SOC electrohydraulic or laser lithotripsy session to clear the bile duct. RESULTS The mean procedure time was longer in the electrohydraulic lithotripsy group (73.9 minutes) than in the laser lithotripsy group (49.9 minutes; P < .001). Ducts were completely cleared (technical success) in 97.3% of patients (96.7% of patients with electrohydraulic lithotripsy vs 99% patients with laser lithotripsy; P = .31). Ducts were cleared in a single session in 77.4% of patients (74.5% by electrohydraulic lithotripsy and 86.1% by laser lithotripsy; P = .20). Electrohydraulic or laser lithotripsy failed in 11 patients (2.7%); 8 patients were treated by surgery. Adverse events occurred in 3.7% patients and the stone was incompletely removed from 6.6% of patients. On multivariable analysis, difficult anatomy or cannulation (duodenal diverticula or altered anatomy) correlated with technical failure (odds ratio, 5.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.26-21.2; P = .02). Procedure time increased odds of more than 1 session of D-SOC electrohydraulic or laser lithotripsy (odds ratio, 1.02; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.03; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS In a multicenter, international, retrospective analysis, we found D-SOC with electrohydraulic or laser lithotripsy to be effective and safe in more than 95% of patients with difficult biliary stones. Fewer than 5% of patients require additional treatment with surgery and/or extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy to clear the duct.","Brewer Gutierrez, Olaya I; Bekkali, Noor L H; Raijman, Isaac; Sturgess, Richard; Sejpal, Divyesh V; Aridi, Hanaa D; Sherman, Stuart; Shah, Raj J; Kwon, Richard S; Buxbaum, James L; Zulli, Claudio; Wassef, Wahid; Adler, Douglas G; Kushnir, Vladimir; Wang, Andrew Y; Krishnan, Kumar; Kaul, Vivek; Tzimas, Demetrios; DiMaio, Christopher J; Ho, Sammy; Petersen, Bret; Moon, Jong Ho; Elmunzer, B Joseph; Webster, George J M; Chen, Yen-I; Dwyer, Laura K; Inamdar, Summant; Patrick, Vanessa B; Attwell, Augustin; Hosmer, Amy; Ko, Christopher; Maurano, Attilio; Sarkar, Avik; Taylor, Linda J; Gregory, Martin H; Strand, Daniel S; Raza, Ali; Kothari, Shivangi; Harris, Jessica P; Kumta, Nikhil A; Manvar, Amar; Topazian, Mark D; Lee, Yun Nah; Spiceland, Clayton M; Trindade, Arvind J; Bukhari, Majidah A; Sanaei, Omid; Ngamruengphong, Saowanee; Khashab, Mouen A",Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association,497,1

Methods: An online survey was conducted among adults in Israel (n=461), immediately after the first COVID-19 vaccine became available (22/12/2020 to 10/1/2021). Two regressions were performed to investigate determinants of intention to receive the available COVID-19 vaccine and sense of urgency to receive the vaccine. Results: Although many adults were willing to receive available COVID-19 vaccine, only 65% were willing to immediately receive the vaccine, 16% preferred to wait 3 months and 18% preferred to wait a year. The sense of urgency to get vaccinated differed by age, periphery level, perceived barriers, cues to action and availability. Incentives such as monetary rewards or the green pass did not increase the probability of getting vaccination immediately. Conclusions: Providing data on the role of incentives in increasing the intention to immediately receive the available COVID-19 vaccine is important for health policy makers and healthcare providers.

However, many destination management models overlook the role of urban zoning. Little is known about the impacts of land-use zoning on the hospitality and property industries, especially with the current disruption of short-term peer-to-peer accommodation like Airbnb. Euclidean zoning, also known as effects-based planning, has long been criticised in destination management for its exclusionary nature and lack of flexibility. With exclusionary zoning, property owners may only be able to use their land sub-optimally, and cities will be less efficient in responding to market changes in short-term and long-term accommodation demands, but planning intentions can be better controlled, and the property supply can be more stable. Taking Hong Kong as a noteworthy case, this study puts forward a conceptual framework that enables comparison of a novel zoning approach with the traditional zoning approach. This novel zoning approach encompasses both the short- and long-term rental sectors as a continuum of accommodation, ranging from hotels and serviced apartments to Airbnb and rental housing units under a unified regulatory and planning regime to enhance the switching options value. This novel zoning system can gear up the tourism sector with the rapid growth of the sharing economy and aligns with sustainable tourism to ensure long-term socioeconomic benefits to related stakeholders.

Poverty and ACEs are often conflated, which can lead to unintended consequences for children and families and for the implementation of policy and practice. Using some of the COVID-19 crisis response measures in Scotland, in particular the example of the hubs for ‘vulnerable’ children and receipt of free school meals (FSMs), this paper explores how poverty and adversity become conflated and how this can impede children's access to support and even to their legal entitlements. The sole criterion for eligibility to FSMs, outwith the universal entitlement for P1-P3s, is low income and the dignified response to an eligibility based exclusively on low income is to provide cash. Yet, many local authorities have imposed a nonmonetary approach to FSM eligibility, even when this has proved difficult, e.g. in sourcing food. By assuming that parents living in poverty will misspend monies meant for children they conflate poverty with adversity. The policy focus in Scotland should prioritise poverty, using a cash-first approach, and trust the majority of parents to prioritise their children. This would also free up resources to provide dedicated services to children who do in fact experience high levels of adversity.","Treanor, Morag C.",Scottish Affairs,497,26

The potential role of medical students in raising awareness during public health emergencies has been acknowledged. To further explore their potentials as public educators and role models for the communities during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a study is conducted to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice of these students toward COVID-19. Methods. An online cross-sectional survey was conducted among undergraduate medical students in Indonesia. Socio-demographical characteristics, social interaction history, information-seeking behavior, as well as knowledge, attitude, and practice toward COVID-19 were collected through a self-reported questionnaire. A p-value of <0.05 indicated statistical significance. Results. Out of 4870 respondents, 64.9% and 51.5% had positive attitude and practice toward COVID-19 while only 29.8% had adequate knowledge. Knowledge was slightly positively correlated with attitude and practice (rho=0.074 and rho=0.054, respectively; both p<0.001), while attitude was weakly correlated with practice (rho=0.234, p<0.001). Several factors including age, sex, place of residence, institution type, academic level, family income, history of chronic illness, prior volunteering experience, and perceptual awareness on COVID-19 were significantly associated with either knowledge, attitude, and/or practice toward COVID-19. Furthermore, health institution's and the government's press releases, as well as health expert opinions were deemed as the most reliable sources of COVID-19-related information - yet trivially none of these sources were associated with knowledge, attitude, and practice in the study population.

There are no vaccines for these important human pathogens, and existing treatments have limited or no efficacy. Infection by HPIV is initiated by viral glycoprotein-mediated fusion between viral and host cell membranes. A viral fusion protein (F), once activated in proximity to a target cell, undergoes a series of conformational changes that first extend the trimer subunits to allow insertion of the hydrophobic domains into the target cell membrane, and then refold the trimer into a stable postfusion state, driving the merger of the viral and host cell membranes. Lipopeptides derived from the C-terminal heptad repeat (HRC) domain of HPIV3 F inhibit infection by interfering with the structural transitions of the trimeric F assembly. Clinical application of this strategy, however, requires improving the in vivo stability of antiviral peptides. We show that the HRC peptide backbone can be modified via partial replacement of α-amino acid residues with β-amino acid residues to generate α/β-peptides that retain antiviral activity but are poor protease substrates. Relative to a conventional α-lipopeptide, our best α/β-lipopeptide exhibits improved persistence in vivo and improved anti-HPIV3 antiviral activity in animals.","Outlaw, Victor K.; Cheloha, Ross W.; Jurgens, Eric M.; Bovier, Francesca T.; Zhu, Yun; Kreitler, Dale F.; Harder, Olivia; Niewiesk, Stefan; Porotto, Matteo; Gellman, Samuel H.; Moscona, Anne",bioRxiv,497,25

Following a U.K. national lockdown from March 20, 2020, we studied business practices and behaviors in licensed premises to inform COVID-19 policies. To our knowledge, no previous study worldwide has examined these issues. METHOD Before premises reopened in Scotland, we conducted in-depth telephone interviews (May-June 2020) with participants from hospitality trade associations, licensed premises, or in related roles (n = 18). Interviews focused on anticipated business practices and challenges relevant to minimizing COVID-19 transmission. Following reopening (July-August 2020), we conducted observations of relevant practices and behaviors in 29 bars purposively sampled for diversity, using a structured schedule. Interviews and observation reports were analyzed thematically. RESULTS Interviewees generally sought clarity, flexibility, and balance in government guidance on reopening, and they cited commercial and practical challenges to doing so safely. Alcohol consumption was perceived as an additional but potentially manageable challenge. Most observed premises had made physical and operational modifications; however, practices were variable. Observed incidents of concern included close physical interaction between customers and with staff, frequently featuring alcohol intoxication and rarely effectively stopped by staff. CONCLUSIONS Despite the efforts of bar operators and guidance from government, potentially significant risks of COVID-19 transmission persisted in a substantial minority of observed bars, especially when customers were intoxicated.","Fitzgerald, Niamh; Uny, Isabelle; Brown, Ashley; Eadie, Douglas; Ford, Allison; Lewsey, Jim; Stead, Martine",Journal of studies on alcohol and drugs,497,19

Game theory models, as well as empirical studies, suggest that begging conveys information on offspring state, which implies that parental investment can be better translated to fitness by responding to begging when allocating resources rather than by ignoring it. However, this assumption and its underlying mechanisms have received little or no attention. Here we show by experiments with hand-raised house sparrow (Passer domesticus) nestlings that a 'responsive parent' will do better than a hypothetical 'non-responsive' mutant (that provides similar food amounts, but irrespective of begging). This is neither because food-deprived nestlings convert food to mass more efficiently, however, nor because responsiveness reduces costly begging. Rather, responsiveness to begging is adaptive because it reduces two opposing risks: one is wasting time when returning too soon to feed already satiated nestlings and the other is repeatedly overlooking some nestlings as a result of the stochastic nature of a random, non-responsive strategy. This study provides the first experimental evidence for the adaptive value of parental responsiveness to offspring begging.","Grodzinski, Uri; Lotem, Arnon",Proceedings. Biological sciences,497,28

AIM: Implementation of a smoking cessation program for patients and employees of a psychiatric ward of an academic medical center in The Netherlands. METHOD: Prospective, mixed-method study of implementation of a smoking cessation program for patients and employees of a psychiatric academic hospital in Amsterdam. The program consisted of 7 weekly group meetings by certified smoking cessation coaches. Nicotine replacement therapy was provided for free, if necessary. RESULTS: During 14 months, 65 individuals were seeking help to stop smoking: 39 patients and 26 employees. Of these, 29 patients and 16 employees participated in group meetings with an average of 2.6 times per person. There were 20 individuals who visited the group meetings or received individual coaching at least 3 times (6 patients and 14 employees). Fifty-five percent of these individuals reported to be smoke-free at 3 months after joining the first meeting. Employees were much more likely to quit than patients. From interviews with 20 participants, it was noticed that combining patients and employees in one group was perceived as a barrier due to a gap in processing speed. CONCLUSION: On the psychiatric ward of an academic hospital in The Netherlands, there was a positive experience with providing smoking cessation treatment. A small number of employees and patients participated in a smoking cessation program and quitting smoking was reached by only a few patients. Supporting smoking cessation in a psychiatric hospital asks for intensive screening, diagnosing, treatment and smoke-free policies.","Vermeulen, J M; Doedens, P; Schirmbeck, F; van den Brink, W; de Haan, L",Tijdschrift voor psychiatrie,497,16

In this review, we focused on the correlation between COVID-19 infection and the high sensitivity troponin T and I, and their significance in the development of myocarditis.

After adjusting for surveillance capacity and time since first imported case, average temperature had a statistically significant, negative association with COVID-19 incidence for temperatures of −15°C and above. However, temperature only explained a relatively modest amount of the total variation in COVID-19 cases. The effect of relative humidity was not statistically significant. These results suggest that warmer weather may modestly reduce the rate of spread of COVID-19, but anticipation of a substantial decline in transmission due to temperature alone with onset of summer in the northern hemisphere, or in tropical regions, is not warranted by these findings.","Meyer, Anne; Sadler, Rohan; Faverjon, Céline; Cameron, Angus Robert; Bannister-Tyrrell, Melanie",Front.

The risk of infection in indoor environments is typically modelled using the Wells-Riley model or a Wells-Riley-like formulation, usually assuming the pathogen dose follows a Poisson distribution (mono-pathogen assumption). Aerosols that hold more than one pathogen copy, i.e. poly-pathogen aerosols, break this assumption even if the aerosol dose itself follows a Poisson distribution. For the largest aerosols where the number of pathogen in each aerosol can sometimes be several hundred or several thousand, the effect is non-negligible, especially in diseases where the risk of infection per pathogen is high. Here we report on a generalization of the Wells-Riley model and dose-response models for poly-pathogen aerosols by separately modeling each number of pathogen copies per aerosol, while the aerosol dose itself follows a Poisson distribution. This results in a model for computational risk assessment suitable for mono-/poly-pathogen aerosols. We show that the mono-pathogen assumption significantly overestimates the risk of infection for high pathogen concentrations in the respiratory tract fluid. The model also includes the aerosol removal due to filtering by the individuals which becomes significant for poorly ventilated environments with a high density of individuals, and systematically includes the effects of facemasks in the infectious aerosol source and sink terms and dose calculations.","Nordsiek, Freja; Bodenschatz, Eberhard; Bagheri, Gholamhossein",PLoS One,497,4

The perhydrolase (AcT) from Mycobacterium smegmatis catalyzes the perhydrolysis of acetate esters to generate the potent disinfectant, peracetic acid (PAA). In the presence of AcT and its two substrates, propylene glycol diacetate and H2O2, sufficient and continuous PAA is generated over an extended time to kill a wide range of bacteria with the enzyme dissolved in aqueous buffer. For extended self-disinfection, however, active and stable AcT bound onto or incorporated into a surface coating is necessary. In the current study, an active, stable and reusable AcT-based coating was developed by incorporating AcT into a polydopamine (PDA) matrix in a single step, thereby forming a biocatalytic composite onto a variety of surfaces. The resulting AcT-PDA composite coatings on glass, metal and epoxy surfaces yielded up to 7-log reduction of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria when in contact with the biocatalytic coating. This composite coating also possessed potent antiviral activity, and dramatically reduced the infectivity of a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus within minutes. The single-step approach enables rapid and facile fabrication of enzyme-based disinfectant composite coatings with high activity and stability, which enables reuse following surface washing. As a result, this enzyme-polymer composite technique may serve as a general strategy for preparing antibacterial and antiviral surfaces for applications in health care and common infrastructure safety, such as in schools, the workplace, transportation, etc.","Wang, Li-Sheng; Xu, Shirley; Gopal, Sneha; Kim, Eunsol; Kim, Domyoung; Brier, Matthew; Solanki, Kusum; Dordick, Jonathan S",Sci Rep,497,4

Public Health England initiated a study, COVID-19 Surveillance in School KIDs (sKIDs), in primary schools when they partially reopened from June 1, 2020, after the first national lockdown in England to estimate the incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, seroprevalence, and seroconversion in staff and students. METHODS: sKIDs, an active, prospective, surveillance study, included two groups: the weekly swabbing group and the blood sampling group. The swabbing group underwent weekly nasal swabs for at least 4 weeks after partial school reopening during the summer half-term (June to mid-July, 2020). The blood sampling group additionally underwent blood sampling for serum SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to measure previous infection at the beginning (June 1-19, 2020) and end (July 3-23, 2020) of the summer half-term, and, after full reopening in September, 2020, and at the end of the autumn term (Nov 23-Dec 18, 2020). We tested for predictors of SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity using logistic regression. We calculated antibody seroconversion rates for participants who were seronegative in the first round and were tested in at least two rounds. FINDINGS: During the summer half-term, 11 966 participants (6727 students, 4628 staff, and 611 with unknown staff or student status) in 131 schools had 40 501 swabs taken. Weekly SARS-CoV-2 infection rates were 4·1 (one of 24 463; 95% CI 0·1-21·8) per 100 000 students and 12·5 (two of 16 038; 1·5-45·0) per 100 000 staff. At recruitment, in 45 schools, 91 (11·2%; 95% CI 7·9-15·1) of 816 students and 209 (15·1%; 11·9-18·9) of 1381 staff members were positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, similar to local community seroprevalence. Seropositivity was not associated with school attendance during lockdown (p=0·13 for students and p=0·20 for staff) or staff contact with students (p=0·37). At the end of the summer half-term, 603 (73·9%) of 816 students and 1015 (73·5%) of 1381 staff members were still participating in the surveillance, and five (four students, one staff member) seroconverted. By December, 2020, 55 (5·1%; 95% CI 3·8-6·5) of 1085 participants who were seronegative at recruitment (in June, 2020) had seroconverted, including 19 (5·6%; 3·4-8·6) of 340 students and 36 (4·8%; 3·4-6·6) of 745 staff members (p=0·60).

The molecular basis underlying the susceptibility of auditory cortex to loss of afferent input remains largely unknown. The transcription factor early growth response-1 (EGR-1) expression in the visual cortex has been shown to be crucial in the formation of vision, but the role of EGR-1 during the process of auditory function formation is still unclear. In this study, we presented data showing that EGR-1 was expressed in the neurons of the primary auditory cortex (A1) in mice. We observed that the auditory deprivation induced by kanamycin during the auditory critical period leads to laminar-specific alteration of neuronal distribution and EGR-1 expression in A1. In addition, MK-801 administration inhibited the expression of EGR-1 in A1 and aggravated the abnormal cortical electric response caused by kanamycin injection. Finally, we showed that the expression of PI3K, the phosphorylation of Akt, as well as the phosphorylation of cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) were decreased in A1 after kanamycin-induced hearing loss. These results characterized the expression of EGR-1 in A1 in response to the acoustic input and suggested the involvement of EGR-1 in auditory function formation.","Wang, Man; Han, Yuechen; Wang, Xue; Liang, Shuo; Bo, Chuan; Zhang, Zhenbiao; Wang, Mingming; Xu, Lei; Zhang, Daogong; Liu, Wenwen; Wang, Haibo",J. mol. neurosci,497,15

Although demographic and clinical parameters such as sex, age, comorbidities, genetic background and various biomarkers have been identified as risk factors, there is an unmet need to predict the risk and onset of severe inflammatory disease leading to poor clinical outcomes. In addition, very few mechanistic biomarkers are available to inform targeted treatment of severe (auto)-inflammatory conditions associated with COVID-19. Calprotectin, also known as S100A8/S100A9, MRP8/14 (Myeloid-Related Protein) or L1, is a heterodimer involved in neutrophil-related inflammatory processes. In COVID-19 patients, calprotectin levels were reported to be associated with poor clinical outcomes such as significantly reduced survival time, especially in patients with severe pulmonary disease. AREAS COVERED: Pubmed was searched using the following keywords: Calprotectin + COVID19, S100A8/A9 + COVID19, S100A8 + COVID-19, S100A9 + COVID-19, MRP8/14 + COVID19; L1 + COVID-19 between May 2020 and 8 March 2021. The results summarized in this review provide supporting evidence and propose future directions that define calprotectin as an important biomarker in COVID-19. EXPERT OPINION: Calprotectin represents a promising serological biomarker for the risk assessment of COVID-19 patients.","Mahler, Michael; Meroni, Pier-Luigi; Infantino, Maria; Buhler, Katherine A; Fritzler, Marvin J",Expert Rev Clin Immunol,497,10

From 'stay-at-home' orders to the progressive lifting of restrictions, the COVID-19 pandemic has had unprecedented effects on consumer behaviours and waste disposal habits. The purpose of this short communication is to examine time series waste collection and disposal data in a mid-sized Canadian city to understand how behavioural changes have affected municipal waste management. The results suggest that private waste disposal increased during the pandemic. This may be due to people doing home renovations in order to accommodate working from home. Furthermore, it appears that changes in consumer habits destabilized the consistency of waste disposal tonnage when compared to the same time period in 2019. When considering curbside residential waste collection, there was also an increase in tonnage. This may be the result of more waste being generated at home due to changes in eating and cooking habits, and cleaning routine. Finally, the ratio of residential waste collection to total disposal is examined. More residential waste is being generated, which may have environmental and operational effects, especially related to collection and transportation. The results from this study are important from an operational perspective, and will help planners and policy makers to better prepare for changes in the waste stream due to pandemics or other emergencies.","Richter, Amy; Ng, Kelvin Tsun Wai; Vu, Hoang Lan; Kabir, Golam",J Environ Manage,497,27

On the surface, RNC may appear to be a case of the usual NP comparative construction in that two NPs are involved. But, unlike typical NP comparatives, the element bearing the marker of the standard of comparison in RNC does not directly participate in the comparison, i.e., there is a mismatch between the standard and pivot. I argue this is due to the fact that the standard is reduced to leave only the pivot on the surface, hence the name ""reduced"" NP comparatives. I also argue that one of the factors that determines the availability of RNC is the notion of comparability, which is based on whether or not the compared elements can be associated with the same scale, where the scale is part of the semantics of the gradable predicate (Cf. Kennedy 2009). The interesting twist is that RNC is possible only if the relevant elements are not comparable with each other, i.e., they should denote different types of objects that cannot be associated with the same scale. Adopting Merchant's (The syntax of silence: sluicing, islands, and the theory of ellipsis.

The discussion also has implications for NP-ellipsis in Korean.","An, Duk-Ho",J East Asian Ling,497,4

This novel coronavirus disease phenotype ranges from asymptomatic carriage to fulminant cytokine storm with respiratory failure, polyorgan dysfunction and death. Severe disease is characterised by exuberant inflammation resulting from high circulating cytokines such as interleukin-6 and tumour necrosis factor. These inflammatory mediators are responsible for the detrimental effects on the immune, hematologic, respiratory, renal, gastrointestinal and other body systems. In addition to inhibition of viral replication, blunting this inflammatory response before overt cytokine storm is important to improve outcomes. Although there are upcoming promising agents such as remdesivir and convalescent plasma, inexpensive, safe and widely available adjunct treatments to ameliorate disease burden would be welcome. Two potential anti-inflammatory agents include indomethacin, which has been shown in experimental models to decrease canine coronavirus levels in dogs and exhibit antiviral activity against several other viruses and the polyphenol, resveratrol, a potent antioxidant that has shown antiviral activity against several viruses.","Marinella, Mark A",Int J Clin Pract,497,24

We identify potential targets for repurposing of licensed medications: using Mendelian randomisation we found evidence in support of a causal link from low expression of IFNAR2, and high expression of TYK2, to life-threatening disease; transcriptome-wide association in lung tissue revealed that high expression of the monocyte/macrophage chemotactic receptor CCR2 is associated with severe Covid-19. Our results identify robust genetic signals relating to key host antiviral defence mechanisms, and mediators of inflammatory organ damage in Covid-19. Both mechanisms may be amenable to targeted treatment with existing drugs.

We aimed to study the symptoms and comorbidities that associate with this pandemic in 3 different regions of Mexico. METHODS: We analyzed data from SARS-CoV-2 positive patients evaluated at healthcare centers and hospitals of Mexico (n = 1607) including Northwest Mexico (Sinaloa state), Southeast Mexico (Veracruz state) and West Mexico (Jalisco state) between March 1 and July 30, 2020. Mexico consists of a total population that exceeds 128 million. Demographics, comorbidities and clinical symptoms were collected. Statistical descriptive analysis and correlation analyses of symptoms, comorbidities and mortality were performed. RESULTS: A total of 1607 hospitalized patients positive for COVID-19 across all 3 regions of Mexico were included. The average age was 54.6 years and 60.4% were male. A mortality rate of 33.1% was observed. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (43.2%), obesity (30.3%) and diabetes (31.4%). Hypertension was more frequent in West (45%), followed by Northwest (37%) and Southeast Mexico (29%). Obesity was around 30% in Northwest and West whereas an 18% was reported in Southeast. Diabetes was most common in West (34%) followed by Northwest (22%) and Southeast (13%). This might be related to the highest mortality rate in Northwest (31%) and West (37%) when compared to Southeast. Most common symptoms in our overall cohort were fever (80.8%), cough (79.8%), headache (66%), dyspnea (71.1%), myalgia (53.8%), joints pain (50.8%) and odynophagia (34.8%). Diarrhea was the main gastrointestinal (GI) symptom (21.3%), followed by abdominal pain (18%), and nausea/ vomiting (4.5%). Diarrhea and abdominal pain were more common in West (23.1 and 21%), followed by Southeast (17.8, and 9.8%) and Northwest (11.4 and 3.1%). CONCLUSION: Our study showed a high mortality rate likely related to high frequencies of comorbidities (hypertension, obesity and diabetes). Mortality was different across regions. These discrepancies might be related to the differences in the frequencies of comorbidities, and partially attributed to differences in socio-economic conditions and quality of care. Thus, our findings stress the need for improved strategies to get better outcomes in our population.","Pizuorno, Antonio; Fierro, Nora A; Copado-Villagrana, Edgar D; Herrera-Solís, María E; Oskrochi, Gholamreza; Brim, Hassan; Ashktorab, Hassan",BMC Infect Dis,497,1

DesignPopulation-wide register-based cohort study. SettingPrimary and lower secondary schools in Norway have been open during the academic year 2020/2021 with strict infection prevention and control (IPC) measures in place. All identified contacts including student and staff members were urged to get tested following a positive SARS-CoV-2 case in a school. ParticipantsAll students and educational staff in Norwegian primary and lower secondary schools from August 2020 to June 2021. Main outcome measuresOverall secondary attack rate (SAR14) was operationalized as the number of secondary cases (among students and/or staff) in the school by 14 days after the index case, divided by the number of students and staff members in the school. Moreover, we calculated SAR14-to-students, denoting transmission from all index cases to students only, SAR14-to-school staff, denoting transmission from all index cases to staff members only. We also calculated these measures in stratified samples consisting of student index cases or school staff index cases. ResultsFrom August 2020 to June 2021 there were 4,078 index cases, 79% were students and 21% were school staff. In the majority (55%) of schools with an index case, no secondary cases were observed by 14 days, and in 16% of the schools there were only one secondary case within 14 days. Overall SAR14 was found to be 0.33% (95%CI 0.32-0.33). Staff-to-staff transmission (SAR14 0.45%, 95%CI 0.40-0.52) was found to be slightly more common than student-to-student (SAR14 0.33%, 95%CI 0.32-0.34) and student-to-staff (SAR14 0.28%, 95%CI 0.25-0.30) transmission. ConclusionsOur results confirm that schools have not been an important arena of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Norway and therefore support that schools can be kept open with IPC measures in place.","Rotevatn, Torill Alise; Larsen, Vilde Bergstad; Johansen, Tone Bjordal; Astrup, Elisabeth; Suren, Paal; Greve-Isdahl, Margrethe; Telle, Kjetil Elias",,497,4

Human CoVs (HCoVs) have long been known to be the causative agents of mild respiratory illnesses. However, two HCoVs associated with severe respiratory diseases are Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoV (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV). Both viruses resulted in hundreds of deaths after spreading to several countries. Most recently, SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as the third HCoV causing severe respiratory distress syndrome and viral pneumonia (known as COVID-19) in patients from Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Soon after its discovery, SARS-CoV-2 spread to all countries, resulting in millions of cases and thousands of deaths. Since the emergence of SARS-CoV, many research groups have dedicated their resources to discovering effective antivirals that can treat such life-threatening infections. The rapid spread and high fatality rate of SARS-CoV-2 necessitate the quick discovery of effective antivirals to control this outbreak. Since SARS-CoV-2 shares 79% sequence identity with SARS-CoV, several anti-SARS-CoV drugs have shown promise in limiting SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro and in vivo. In this review, we discuss antivirals described for SARS-CoV and provide an update on therapeutic strategies and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.

Infection was diagnosed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in respiratory specimens. The level of viral load was categorized as high, moderate, or low based on the cycle threshold values. There were 109 household members (66 adults and 43 children). The median attack rate per cluster was 60% (range: 33.4%-100%). An adult member with COVID-19 was the first case in 21 (91.3%) clusters.

Methods: Data on baseline characteristics, stroke subtype, initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, the time between last known well (LKW) to emergency department (ED) arrival, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) administration, the involvement of large vessel occlusion (LVO), and whether mechanical thrombectomy (MT) was pursued in patients with acute stroke were extracted from 24 March to 23 April 2020 (the time period of a stay-at-home order was placed due to the COVID-19 pandemic as the study group) at a tertiary care hospital in West Michigan, USA, compared with data from 24 March to 23 April 2019 (control group). Results: Our study demonstrated a reduction in cases of acute ischemic stroke (AIS), although this did not reach statistical significance. However, there was an increase in hemorrhagic stroke (7.5% controls vs. 19.2% study group). The age of stroke patients was significantly younger during the period of the stay-at-home order compared to the control group. We identified a significant overall delay of ED arrivals from LKW in the study group. Additionally, an increased number of AIS patients with LVO in the study group (34.8%) was found compared to the control group (17.5%). A significantly increased number of patients received MT in the study group. Additionally, 11 patients were COVID-19 PCR-positive in the study group, 10 with AIS and only 1 with hemorrhagic stroke. Patients with COVID-19 had a high incidence of atrial fibrillation and hyperlipidemia. One AIS patient with COVID-19 rapidly developed cytotoxic edema with corresponding elevated inflammatory biomarkers. No statistical significance was noted when stroke subtype, LVO, and MT groups were compared. Conclusions: There was a trend of decreasing AIS admissions during the COVID-19 pandemic. There was also a significantly increased number of AIS patients with LVO who received MT, especially those with COVID-19. We conclude that cytokine storm resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection might play a role in AIS patients with COVID-19.","Fnu, Rameez McCarthy Philip Cheng Yao Packard Laurel M.; Davis, Alan T.; Wees, Nabil Khan Nadeem Singer Justin Khan Muhib Min Jiangyong",Cerebrovascular Diseases.

These models allow high precision ASR for domains and words represented in the training material but have difficulties recognising words that are rarely or not at all represented during training, i.e. trending words and new named entities. In this paper, we use a text-to-speech (TTS) engine to provide synthetic audio for out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. We aim to boost the recognition accuracy of a recurrent neural network transducer (RNN-T) on OOV words by using those extra audio-text pairs, while maintaining the performance on the non-OOV words. Different regularisation techniques are explored and the best performance is achieved by fine-tuning the RNN-T on both original training data and extra synthetic data with elastic weight consolidation (EWC) applied on encoder. This yields 57% relative word error rate (WER) reduction on utterances containing OOV words without any degradation on the whole test set.","Zheng, Xianrui; Liu, Yulan; Gunceler, Deniz; Willett, Daniel",,497,1

However, most rely on measurements not readily available. We evaluated hematological and biochemical markers taken on admission and determined how predictive they were of development of critical illness or death. We observed that higher values of readily available tests, including neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio; derived neutrophil index; and troponin I were associated with a higher risk of death or critical care admission (P < 0.001). We show that common hematological tests can be helpful in determining early in the course of illness which patients are likely to develop severe forms, as well as allocating resources to those patients early, while avoiding overuse of limited resources in patients with reduced risk of progression to severe disease.","Núñez, Isaac; Priego-Ranero, Ángel A; García-González, H Benjamín; Jiménez-Franco, Brenda; Bonilla-Hernández, Rebeca; Domínguez-Cherit, Guillermo; Merayo-Chalico, Javier; Crispín, José C; Barrera-Vargas, Ana; Valdés-Ferrer, Sergio Iván",Clin Immunol,497,0

The language used in this letter should be ""easily understood by a lay person."" In February 2019, the authors' institution revised the language of its recall lay letter to the sixth grade reading level. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect of improved readability on patient follow-up rates. METHODS: In this retrospective study, data from all screening mammograms at a single institution with BI-RADS category 0 assessments excluding technical recalls between February 2018 to February 2019 (pre-intervention group) and February 2019 to February 2020 (post-intervention group) were reviewed. The primary outcome measure was the percentage of patients in each intervention group who returned for their diagnostic follow-up examination within 60 days (the standard recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was done to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for follow-up within 60 days. RESULTS: This study included 1,987 patients in the pre-intervention group and 2,211 patients in the post-intervention group. The patient follow-up rate within 60 days increased from 90.1% (1,790 of 1,987) in the pre-intervention group to 93.9% (2,076 of 2,211) in the post-intervention group (P < .001). When controlling for imaging site, patients in the post-intervention group had 1.96-fold increased odds of returning for a diagnostic follow-up examination within 60 days (95% confidence interval, 1.52-2.53).

However, chemotherapy is often omitted either because of physician bias or because of its underlying comorbidity, thus compromising their survival. The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic is compounding this issue because of the fear of immunosuppression induced by chemotherapy on the elderly which makes them more vulnerable to the virus. SUMMARY: Immunotherapy has less effect on the patient bone marrow compared to chemotherapy. The potential synergy between radiotherapy and immunotherapy may improve local control and survival for older patients with selected cancer. Preliminary data are encouraging because of better survival and local control in diseases which are traditionally resistant to radiotherapy and chemotherapy such as melanoma and renal cell carcinoma. Key Message: We propose a new paradigm combining immunotherapy at a reduced dose and/or extended dosing intervals and hypofractionated radiotherapy for older patients with selected cancer which needs to be tested in future clinical trials.","Nguyen, Nam Phong; Baumert, Brigitta G; Oboite, Eromosele; Motta, Micaela; Appalanaido, Gokula Kumar; Arenas, Meritxell; Lara, Pedro Carlos; Bonet, Marta; Zamagni, Alice; Vuong, Te; Popescu, Tiberiu; Karlsson, Ulf; Trigo, Lurdes; Sun Myint, Arthur; Thariat, Juliette; Vinh-Hung, Vincent",Gerontology,497,20

Involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) occurs probably via transsynaptic spread or transfer across the blood-brain barrier. Hypoxia, immune-mediated injury, and vascular damage are the potential mechanisms for the CNS manifestations. Headache, dizziness, chemosensory disturbances, such as loss of smell, taste, encephalopathy, stroke, etc., are among the commonly encountered neurological presentations. Headache is identified as one of the red flag symptoms for COVID-19. Sudden onset of loss of smell and/or taste in the absence of nasal congestion can help in COVID-19 case identification and testing prioritization. Both hemorrhagic and ischemic brain injury is common in patients developing stroke. Besides these, COVID-19-associated CNS involvement demands more careful attention toward patients with existing neurological disorders especially that are managed with immunosuppressant agents. In all, neurological involvement in COVID-19 is not uncommon and may precede, occur concomitantly or after the respiratory involvement. It may also be the sole presentation in some of the patients necessitating high vigilance for COVID-19.

The participants recruited were above 18 years of age residing in Odisha. The participation in the survey was completely voluntary. The survey was conducted during February 2021.Results and discussion: In total, 359 members participated in the survey. Majority of the respondent strongly agree/agree that covid-19 vaccine is safe for adults and children. Significant variation among all the groups was found regarding acquisition of higher immunity following infection rather by vaccination, effectiveness in infection prevention, safety in children, provision of mandatory vaccination by government, and public health protection following government guidelines.Conclusion: The major barrier to the covid-19 vaccination was found to be safety and awareness.

Most of the available data in the literature is derived from Chinese cohorts and we aim to contribute the clinical experience of a single British clinical centre with the characteristics of a British cohort. DESIGN: A prospective case series. SETTING: A single clinical centre in the UK. METHODS: We have collected the demographics and medical characteristics of all COVID-19-positive cases admitted over 2-week period. All cases were diagnosed by PCR. RESULTS: Total of 71 COVID-19 patients were included in this case series. Majority of patients (75%) were &#8805;75 years old and 58% were men. Pre-existing comorbidities was common (85% of patients). Most patients presented with respiratory symptoms such as fever (59%), shortness of breath (56%) and cough (55%). Gastrointestinal symptoms were second-most common presenting compliant such as diarrhoea (10%) and abdominal pain (7%). Opacification in chest X-rays was demonstrated in 45% of patients. All patients received supportive treatment and no specific antiviral therapy was administered in this cohort. So far, 18 (25%) patients have fully recovered, 9 patients (13%) escalated to a higher level of care and 10 (14%) have died. Patients who died were non-significantly older than those who have recovered (78.0 vs 69.2 years, P = .15) but they had a significantly higher clinical frailty scores (5.75 vs 3.36, P = .005). CONCLUSION: This case series demonstrated that the characteristics of British COVID-19 patients were generally similar to what is published in literature, although we report more gastrointestinal symptoms at presentation.

To better explore the infection mechanism and treatment, the three-dimensional structure of human bronchus has been employed in a better in-depth study on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: We downloaded a separate microarray from the Integrated Gene Expression System (GEO) on a human bronchial organoids sample to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGS) and analyzed it with R software. After processing with R software, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto PBMCs of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were analyzed, while a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed to show the interactions and influence relationships between these differential genes. Finally, the selected highly connected genes, which are called hub genes, were verified in CytoHubba plug-in. RESULTS: In this study, a total of 966 differentially expressed genes, including 490 upregulated genes and 476 downregulated genes were used. Analysis of GO and KEGG revealed that these differentially expressed genes were significantly enriched in pathways related to immune response and cytokines. We construct protein-protein interaction network and identify 10 hub genes, including IL6, MMP9, IL1B, CXCL8, ICAM1, FGF2, EGF, CXCL10, CCL2, CCL5, CXCL1, and FN1. Finally, with the help of GSE150728, we verified that CXCl1, CXCL8, CXCL10, CCL5, EGF differently expressed before and after SARS-CoV-2 infection in clinical patients. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we used mRNA expression data from GSE150819 to preliminarily confirm the feasibility of hBO as an in vitro model to further study the pathogenesis and potential treatment of COVID-19. Moreover, based on the mRNA differentiated expression of this model, we found that CXCL8, CXCL10, and EGF are hub genes in the process of SARS-COV-2 infection, and we emphasized their key roles in SARS-CoV-2 infection. And we also suggested that further study of these hub genes may be beneficial to treatment, prognostic prediction of COVID-19.","Fang, Ke-Ying; Cao, Wen-Chao; Xie, Tian-Ao; Lv, Jie; Chen, Jia-Xin; Cao, Xun-Jie; Li, Zhong-Wei; Deng, Shu-Ting; Guo, Xu-Guang",Hum Genomics,497,10

These agents, along with non-scintigraphic biomarkers from blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have provided an opportunity to investigate the pathogenesis, prodromal changes and time course of the disease in living individuals. The current understanding of the neuropathological changes of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) continuum is now known to begin up to 25 years prior to the onset of clinical symptomatology. The opportunities afforded by in-vivo biomarkers of AD, whether by CSF examination or PET, have transformed the design of AD therapeutic trials by shifting focus to the preclinical stages of disease. Future disease modifying therapies, should they be forthcoming, will rely heavily on the use of approved biomarkers or biomarkers currently under investigation to confirm the presence of target pathology. Understanding the progressive neuropathological changes that occur in Alzheimer's Disease, and how scintigraphic findings relate to these changes will serve the interpreting physician to fully appreciate the implications of their findings and provide a basis to interpret their examinations. The recently adopted National Institute of Ageing - Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) guidelines define post mortem AD neuropathological changes as a composite score based upon three elements. These elements are the extent of involvement (spread) by cerebral amyloid based on the progression model defined by the Thal amyloid phases, the extent of involvement (spread) by neurofibrillary tangles (composed of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins) based on the progression model defined by Braak and, thirdly, the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) score, which describes the density of neuritic amyloid plaques based on certain key locations in the neocortex. This paper will review the three elements that define the NIAA-AA scoring system and discuss current evidence as to how they relate to the findings based on amyloid and tau PET scintigraphy.","Koychev, Ivan; Hofer, Monika; Friedman, Nicholas C",J. nucl. med,497,1

Gynecomastia, benign enlargement of the male breast is the most common breast pathology amongst males. The most widely used modality of treatment is liposuction under general anesthesia. To date however there is no published study that specifically addresses to use tumescent anesthesia & use of tranexamic acid in it for excision of gynecomastia. Objective. To evaluate the efficacy of tumescent anesthesia in surgical excision of gynecomastia. Methods. A 4-year study with 100 patients of gynecomastia aged 14 to 47 years were enrolled with follow up for 3 months. All patients were given tumescence anesthesia in each breast comprising subcutaneous infiltration of 500 ml RL, 20 ml 0.5% bupivacaine, 30 ml 2% lignocaine, 1 mg adrenaline & 1 gm tranexamic acid. Breast tissue was excised in each breast by a single infraareolar incision & patients were assessed for intra-op pain and post-op pain by using numeric rating scale (NRS). Results. Bilateral presentation was there in 69 patients and 31 unilateral with 4 recurrent cases. Size of gland excised were 12-14 cms in 53 cases, 15-18 cms in 38 & 19-20 cms in 9 patients. Average surgical time required for each breast was 30 minutes. Intraoperative pain NRS-0 for 66, NRS-1 for 31 & NRS-5 for 03 patients. Postoperative pain for first eight hours was NRS-0 for 69 and NRS-1 for 31 patients. Conclusion. Tumescent anaesthesia for surgical excision of gynecomastia using a periareolar incision is a minimally invasive bloodless and painless technique in which ductal and stromal tissue can be removed resulting in a high level of patient satisfaction. In todays covid era it avoids the use of general anesthesia and electrocautery.","Mohan, Amitabh; Rangwala, Murtuza; Rajendran, Nagamahendran",Surg Innov,497,26

In this study, the aim was to evaluate the relationship between vitamin D levels and clinical severity and inflammation markers in children and adolescents with COVID-19. The clinical and laboratory records of 103 pediatric cases with COVID-19, whose vitamin D levels had been measured, were retrospectively reviewed. The cases were divided into groups according to their clinical severity (asymptomatic, mild, and moderate-to-severe) and vitamin D levels. The moderate-to-severe clinical group had significantly higher inflammation markers (CRP, procalcitonin, fibrinogen, D-dimer) and a lower lymphocyte count compared to both the mild and asymptomatic groups. The 25 OH vitamin D levels were also significantly lower (p < 0.001), and the ratio of vitamin D deficiency was 70.6% in the moderate-to-severe group. The vitamin D-deficient group had a significantly higher age and fibrinogen levels while also having a lower lymphocyte count compared to the insufficient and normal groups. The 25 OH vitamin D level was correlated positively with the lymphocyte count (r = 0.375, p = <0.001), and negatively with age (r = -0.496, p = <0.001), CRP (r = -0.309, p = 0.002) and fibrinogen levels (r = -0.381, p = <0.001). In a logistic regression analysis, vitamin D deficiency, D-dimer, and fibrinogen levels on admission were independent predictors of severe clinical course.Conclusion: This study revealed an association between vitamin D deficiency and clinical severity, in addition to inflammation markers in pediatric COVID-19 cases. Prophylactic vitamin D supplementation may be considered, especially in the adolescent age group.

In the backward step-wise logistic regression analysis, HCWs with anxiety disorder were more likely to be doctors/nurses/hospital assistants, older, female, unmarried, without a leisure activity, report increased alcohol use and suicidal thoughts after pandemic onset, and having a history of receiving mental health interventions. Participants with depression additionally had family distress and hardly ever exercised. To conclude, mental health issues are common among HCWs in India. Interventions need to ensure that HCWs are protected from mental health consequences of working in COVID-19 treatment settings.","Parthasarathy, Rajani; Ts, Jaisoorya; K, Thennarasu; Murthy, Pratima",Asian J Psychiatr,497,16

No specific options (antiviral, monoclonal antibody or vaccine) are available for controlling and treatment of the COVID-19 infection, Convalescent plasma (CP) therapy becomes the first available option to treat this pandemic situation according to the successful use of plasma therapy in a historical corona virus outbreak. Plasma obtained from COVID-19 recovered patients is used as prophylaxis therapy or as a therapeutic option. Plasma collection, preparation, and administration requires a proper procedure to enhance its productivity. Preparation of plasma with adequate neutralizing antibody titer becomes challenging. CP therapy may provide antiviral and immunomodulatory effect to SARS-CoV-2 infected patients by controlling overactive immune system such as cytokine storm, Th1/Th17 ratio, and hypercoagulable state. Based on the available case studies data, the administration of CP is proven to be beneficial in treating critically ill patients of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Passive antibody transfusion may reduce viral load with no severe adverse reaction and provide passive immunity against the virus. However, further well-designed clinical trials are needed to establish true clinical efficacy and safety of plasma therapy.","Jain, Aashi; Haque, Irfanul; Bhyan, Sarita Jangra; Thomas, Besty; Kumari, Amrita; Hamid, Kulsoom; Sreelakshmi, M.; Goel, Nancy; Chauhan, Rashi",Int.

We report on comparisons of sound environments in three sites, before, during, and after the lockdown. The project is conducted in collaboration with the Montreal festival district (Quartier des Spectacles) as part of the Sounds in the City partnership. The analyses rely on continuous acoustic monitoring of three sites. The comparisons are presented in terms of (1) energetic acoustic indicators over different periods of time (Lden, Ld, Le, Ln), (2) statistical acoustic indicators (L10, L90), and (3) hourly, daily, and weekly profiles of sound levels throughout the day. Preliminary analyses reveal sound level reductions on the order of 6-7 dB(A) during lockdown, with differences more or less marked across sites and times of the day. After lockdown, sound levels gradually increased following an incremental relaxation of confinement. Within four weeks, sound levels measurements nearly reached the pre-COVID-19 levels despite a reduced number of pedestrian activities. Long-term measurements suggest a 'new normal' that is not quite as loud without festival activities, but that is also not characterizable as quiet. The study supports reframing debates about noise control and noise management of festival areas to also consider the sounds of such areas when festival sounds are not present.","Steele, Daniel; Guastavino, Catherine",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),497,16

Ravulizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to complement protein C5 and inhibits terminal complement activation, is being evaluated as a treatment for COVID-19-related severe pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome in an ongoing phase 3 randomized controlled trial (ALXN1210-COV-305). To address the overactivation of terminal complement in severe COVID-19 compared to the diseases in which ravulizumab is currently approved, a modified dosing regimen was adopted. This analysis evaluates preliminary pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data to confirm the modified dosing regimen. METHODS: Weight-based ravulizumab doses were administered on days 1, 5, 10, and 15. Serum levels of ravulizumab and free C5 were measured before and after administration of ravulizumab and any time on day 22. Free C5 levels < 0.5 µg/mL indicate complete C5 inhibition. The pharmacokinetic target was defined as ravulizumab concentrations at the end of the dosing interval > 175 µg/mL, the concentration above which C5 is completely inhibited. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were included in this evaluation. At baseline, mean C5 concentration was 240 ± 67 µg/mL. In all patients and at all individual timepoints after the first dose was administered, ravulizumab concentrations remained > 175 µg/mL and free C5 concentrations remained < 0.5 µg/mL. CONCLUSION: High levels of baseline C5 observed in patients with severe COVID-19 contribute to the growing body of evidence that suggests this disease is marked by amplification of terminal complement activation. Data from this preliminary pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic evaluation of 22 patients with severe COVID-19 show that the modified ravulizumab dosing regimen achieved immediate and complete terminal complement inhibition, which can be sustained for up to 22 days. These data support the continued use of this dosage regimen in the ongoing phase 3 study.

Method: The Depression Anxiety Stress Scales 21 (DASS-21) questionnaire was distributed via the university students' emails. Of the 71,945 full-time undergraduate university students, 3,515 respondents completed the questionnaire. The questionnaire also included demographic information, such as age, gender, source of income, living arrangements, smoking status, and weekly physical exercise. Results: Nearly half of the participants experienced normal levels of stress (40.5%, n=1425) and anxiety (42.4%, n=1492). In terms of depression, nearly one-third were classified as normal (29.3%, n=1031);however, one-fourth were classified as extremely severe (23.8%, n=838). There were significantly higher levels of stress among female students. Additionally, a significantly higher rate of male students (50.4%, n=667) had normal anxiety levels compared to female students (37.7%, n=825). Finally, a significantly higher proportion of female students had symptoms of depression (72.66%, n=1,592) compared with the degrees of depression among male students (67.37%, n=892). Conclusion: We detected that stress, anxiety, and depression increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, and university students were at higher risk of developing mental health issues.

The ""shock and kill"" strategy was confirmed to reactivate HIV-1 latent reservoirs by latency-reversing agents (LRAs) for accelerated HIV-1 clearance. However, a single LRA might be insufficient to induce HIV-1 reactivation from latency due to the complexity of the multiple signaling regulatory pathways that establish the HIV-1 latent reservoir. Therefore, combinations of LRAs or dual-mechanism LRAs are urgently needed to purge the latent reservoirs. We demonstrate here for the first time that a dual-target inhibitor with a specific suppressive effect on both BRD4 and TIP60, CPI-637, could reactivate latent HIV-1 in vitro by permitting Tat to bind positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) and assembling Tat-super-elongation complex (SEC) formation. In addition, CPI-637-mediated TIP60 downregulation further stimulated BRD4 dissociation from the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter, allowing Tat to more effectively bind P-TEFb compared to BRD4 inhibition alone. Much more importantly, CPI-637 exerted a potent synergistic effect but alleviated global T cell activation and blocked viral spread to uninfected bystander CD4+ T cells with minimal cytotoxicity. Our results indicate that CPI-637 opens up the prospect of novel dual-target inhibitors for antagonizing HIV-1 latency and deserves further investigation for development as a promising LRA with a ""shock and kill"" strategy.","Zheng, Tengyi; Chen, Pei; Huang, Yifan; Qiu, Jiayin; Zhou, Chenliang; Wu, Ziyao; Li, Lin",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,497,33

This study evaluates the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on presentation, treatment, and outcomes of patients with emergent large-vessel occlusion using data from a large health system in the Bronx, New York. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 2 cohorts of consecutive patients with emergent large-vessel occlusion admitted to 3 Montefiore Health System hospitals in the Bronx from January 1 to February 17, 2020, (prepandemic) and March 1 to April 17, 2020 (pandemic). We abstracted data from the electronic health records on presenting biomarker profiles, admission and postprocedural NIHSS scores, time of symptom onset, time of hospital presentation, time of start of the thrombectomy procedure, time of revascularization, presenting ASPECTS, TICI recanalization score, mRS, functional outcomes, and mortality. RESULTS: Of 179 patients admitted with ischemic stroke during the study periods, 80 had emergent large-vessel occlusion, of whom 36 were in the pandemic group. Patients in the pandemic group were younger (66 versus 72 years, P < .061) and had lower ASPECTS (7 versus 9, P < .001) and took longer to arrive at the hospital (361 versus 152 minutes, P < .004) with no other major differences. There was a decreased rate of thrombolysis administration (22% versus 43%, P < .049) and a decreased number of patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy (33% versus 61%, P < .013). CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic led to delays in patients arriving at hospitals, leading to decreased patients eligible for treatment, while in-hospital evaluation and treatment times remain unchanged.","Altschul, D J; Haranhalli, N; Esenwa, C; Unda, S R; de La Garza Ramos, R; Dardick, J; Fernandez-Torres, J; Toma, A; Labovitz, D; Cheng, N; Lee, S K; Brook, A; Zampolin, R",AJNR am. j. neuroradiology,497,19

In the current study, we explore the influence of rearing environment and experimenter administered adolescent ethanol on the hedonic value of ethanol, sucrose, and quinine. Male and female rats were reared for 30 days starting at postnatal day (PND) 21 in either an enriched, isolated, or standard condition and received 1.5 g/kg (i.p.) 20% (w/v) ethanol or saline every other day for 12 days starting at PND 28. Thereafter, all rats had indwelling intraoral fistulae implanted and their taste reactivity to water, ethanol (5, 10, 20, 30, 40% v/v), sucrose (0.1, 0.25, 0.5 M), and quinine (0.1, 0.5 mM) was recorded and analyzed. Results indicated that enrichment elevated hedonic responding to sucrose compared to isolation and induced a stronger negative relationship between hedonic responding and ethanol concentration compared to standard conditions. Enrichment also elevated aversive responding to ethanol and quinine compared to both isolated and standard condition rats. Adolescent ethanol injections marginally reduced aversive responding to quinine. These results replicate previous findings that environmental enrichment enhances both ""liking"" and aversion. In addition, the current findings suggest that, while adolescent ethanol injections may blunt aversive responses to quinine, they have no effect on aversive or hedonic responding to ethanol or sucrose. Together with existing literature our results may suggest that experience with the taste of ethanol is necessary for alterations to ethanol ""liking"" and aversion.","Wukitsch, Thomas J; Moser, Theodore J; Brase, Emma C; Kiefer, Stephen W; Cain, Mary E",Alcohol,497,19

OBJECTIVE: This study focused on how sleep characteristics in the United States may be different from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: To this end, the sleep characteristics of a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults collected before the COVID-19 outbreak (i.e., 2018 National Health Interview Survey, n = 19,433) were compared to the sleep characteristics of a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults recruited via Luc.id, an online survey sampling company, during the COVID-19 outbreak (i.e., 2020 Luc.id, n = 2059). RESULTS: While average sleep duration did not change between 2018 and 2020, the prevalence of both shorter and longer than recommended sleep duration were greater in 2020. Moreover, the number of days with difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, and not feeling rested was greater in 2020 than 2018. Adults younger than 60 had larger differences than those 60 or older. CONCLUSIONS: Sleep health in U.S. adults was worse in 2020 than in 2018, particularly in adults younger than 60.

In addition, business processes are becoming fragmented into smaller components, so-called short-term projects. These work arrangements are often carried out by so-called independent professionals (contractors), better known as freelancers. A literature review has shown that the research topic of freelancing from an entrepreneurial perspective is relatively new and has its assumptions and gaps. Different stakeholders and institutions connect, mediate and manage the services of the entrepreneurial ecosystem to support entrepreneurs. As freelancers belong to the self-employed entrepreneurial category, they are engaged in business activities and need support from their environment. To contribute to this topic, we have analyzed the relationships between freelancers’ job and career satisfaction, digitalization and entrepreneurial ecosystem factors, with the aim of making policy recommendations. Regarding the entrepreneurial environment, we analyzed the cultural and social norms and government programs that provide support, based on the measurement instrument, developed in the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) research. We surveyed 200 freelancers (respondents) in Slovenia. Using factor analysis and structural equation modelling, the empirical results suggest that digitalization and cultural and social norms are significant factors that promote the success of new careers as freelancers in terms of job and career satisfaction. The results show that both positively influence job and career satisfaction, while government programs indirectly influence the job and career satisfaction of freelancers.

SARS-CoV-2 infection is distinguished with multiple epidemiological and pathological features, one of them being the elevated levels of cytokine release, which in turn trigger an aberrant uncontrolled response known as ""cytokine storm"". This phenomenon contributes to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to pneumonia and respiratory failure, which is considered a major contributor to COVID-19-associated fatality rates. Taking into account that the vast majority of the COVID-19 cases are aggravated by the respiratory and multiorgan failure triggered by the sustained release of cytokines, implementing therapeutics that alleviate or diminish the upregulated inflammatory response would provide a therapeutic advantage to COVID-19 patients. Indeed, dexamethasone, a widely available and inexpensive corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory effects, has shown a great promise in reducing mortality rates in COVID-19 patients. In this review, we have critically compared the clinical impact of several potential therapeutic agents that could block or interfere with the cytokine storm, such as IL-1 inhibitors, IL-6 inhibitors, mast cell targeting agents, and corticosteroids.

Despite near hourly reporting on this crisis, there has been no regular, updated, or accurate reporting of hospitalizations for COVID-19. It is known that many test-positive individuals may not develop symptoms or have a mild self-limited viral syndrome consisting of fever, malaise, dry cough, and constitutional symptoms. However some individuals develop a more fulminant syndrome including viral pneumonia, respiratory failure requiring oxygen, acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring mechanical ventilation, and in substantial fractions leading to death attributable to COVID-19. The pandemic is evolving in a clustered, non-inform fashion resulting in many hospitals with preparedness but few or no cases, and others that are completely overwhelmed. Thus, a considerable risk of spread when personal protection equipment becomes exhausted and a large fraction of mortality in those not offered mechanical ventilation are both attributable to a crisis due to maldistribution of resources. The pandemic is amenable to self-reporting through a mobile phone application that could obtain critical information on suspected cases and report on the results of self testing and actions taken. The only method to understand the clustering and the immediate hospital resource needs is mandatory, uniform, daily reporting of hospital censuses of COVID-19 cases admitted to hospital wards and intensive care units.

The evolving SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic presents a series of challenges to clinical diagnostic services. Many proprietary PCR platforms deployed outside centralised laboratories have limited capacity to upscale when public health demands increase. We set out to develop and validate an open-platform mobile laboratory for remote area COVID-19 diagnosis, with a subsequent field trial.Gap Statement. In regional Western Australia, molecular diagnostic support is limited to near point-of-care devices. We therefore aimed to demonstrate open-platform capability in a rapidly deployable format within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.Methodology. We compared, selected and validated components of a SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay in order to establish a portable molecular diagnostics laboratory. The optimal combination of PCR assay equipment, reagents and consumables required for operation to national standards in regional laboratories was identified. This comprised RNA extraction and purification (QuickGene-480, Kurabo, Japan), a duplex RT-PCR assay (Logix Smart COVID-19, Co-Diagnostics, USA), a Myra liquid handling robot (Biomolecular Systems, Australia) and a magnetic induction thermal cycler (MIC, Biomolecular Systems).Results The 95 and 99% limits of detection were 1.01 copies µl-1 (5.05 copies per reaction) and 2.80 copies µl-1 (14.00 copies per reaction) respectively. The Co-Diagnostics assay amplified both SARS-CoV-1 and -2 RNA but showed no other cross reactivity. Qualitative results aligned with the reference laboratory SARS-CoV-2 assay (sensitivity 100% [95 % CI 96.48-100%], specificity 100% [95% CI 96.52-100%]). In field trials, the laboratory was operational within an hour of arrival on-site, can process up to 36 samples simultaneously, produces results in two and a half hours from specimen reception, and performed well during six consecutive runs during a 1 week deployment.Conclusion. Our mobile laboratory enables an adaptive response to increased test demand, and unlike many proprietary point-of-care PCR systems, rapid substitution with an alternative assay if gene targets change or reagent supply chains fail. We envisage operation of this RT-PCR assay as a standby capability to meet varying regional test demands under public health emergency operations guidance.","Paton, Teagan F; Marr, Ian; O039,; Keefe, Zoe; Inglis, Timothy J J",J. medical microbiol,497,22

Limited progress has been made since the formulation of the World Health Organisation (WHO) Global Strategy in 2010. WHO is seeking to accelerate progress in implementing international efforts to reduce the harmful use of alcohol. The threat to global health posed by tobacco is well understood by policy communities and populations globally; by contrast alcohol is much less so, despite available evidence. THE COMPETITION FOR EPISTEMIC AUTHORITY: Global alcohol corporations have sought to become trusted sources of advice for policy makers and consumers, while continuing to grow their markets. Evidence-informed public health messaging faces formidable competition from transnational corporations as the worlds of corporate and political communications, social and mainstream media become increasingly linked, presenting new opportunities for corporate actors to shape global health governance. Alcohol messaging that uses means of persuasion tied to industry agendas does not tell a clear story about commercial determinants of health, and does not contribute to health improvement. On the contrary, the basic tenets of an evidence-informed population-based approach are denied and the policy measures supported by high quality evidence are being opposed, because they are inimical to commercial interests. A David and Goliath metaphor for this state of affairs, which seems to fit at first glance, may unwittingly reinforce the status quo. CONCLUSION: Public opinion on alcohol and policy issues varies across time and place and can be influenced by dedicated public health interventions. Alcohol marketing dominates people's thinking about alcohol because we currently allow this to happen. Greater ambition is needed in developing countermarketing and other interventions to promote evidence-informed ideas with the public. Alcohol policies need to be further developed, and implemented more widely, in order to arrest the growing burden of alcohol harms across the world.","Madden, Mary; McCambridge, Jim",Global Health,497,6

We undertook an epidemiologic investigation to describe the outbreak and guide public health action. Confirmed cases of COVID-19 were identified from reports of SARS-CoV-2-positive laboratory test results to South Central Public Health District. Information on symptoms, hospitalization, recent travel, healthcare worker status, and close contacts was obtained by medical record review and patient interviews. Viral sequence analysis was conducted on a subset of available specimens. During March 13-April 10, 2020, a total of 451 COVID-19 cases among Blaine County residents (1,959 cases per 100,000 population) were reported, with earliest illness onset March 1. The median patient age was 51 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 37-63), 52 (11.5%) were hospitalized, and 5 (1.1%) died. The median duration between specimen collection and a positive laboratory result was 9 days (IQR: 4-10). Forty-four (9.8%) patients reported recent travel and an additional 37 cases occurred in out-of-state residents. Healthcare workers comprised 56 (12.4%) cases; 33 of whom worked at the only hospital in the county, leading to a 15-day disruption of hospital services. Among 562 close contacts monitored by public health authorities, laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 or compatible symptoms were identified in 51 (9.1%). Sequencing results from 34 specimens supported epidemiologic findings indicating travel as a source of SARS-CoV-2, and identified multiple lineages among hospital workers. Community mitigation strategies included school and resort closure, stay-at-home orders, and restrictions on incoming travelers. COVID-19 outbreaks in rural communities can disrupt health services. Lack of local laboratory capacity led to long turnaround times for COVID-19 test results. Rural communities frequented by tourists face unique challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. Implementing restrictions on incoming travelers and other mitigation strategies helped reduce COVID-19 transmission early in the pandemic.","Dunne, Eileen M; Maxwell, Tanis; Dawson-Skuza, Christina; Burns, Matthew; Ball, Christopher; Turner, Kathryn; Hahn, Christine G; Bowyer, Melody; Carter, Kris K; Hudson, Logan",PLoS One,497,20

The survey assessed (1) demographics, (2) changes in access to educational and healthcare services and (3) available and preferred resources to help families navigate the changes in service allocation. RESULTS: Of the 818 responses (669 within the USA and 149 outside of the USA), most families reported a loss of at least some educational or healthcare services. Seventy-four per cent of parents reported that their child lost access to at least one therapy or education service, and 36% of respondents lost access to a healthcare provider. Only 56% reported that their child received at least some continued services through tele-education. Those that needed to access healthcare providers did so primarily through telemedicine. Telehealth (both tele-education and telemedicine) was reported to be helpful when available, and caregivers most often endorsed a need for an augmentation of these remote delivery services, such as 1:1 videoconference sessions, as well as increased access to 1:1 aides in the home. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 restrictions have greatly affected access to services for individuals with syndromic IDDs. Telehealth may provide opportunities for delivery of care and education in a sustainable way, not only as restrictions endure but also after they have been lifted.","Jeste, S; Hyde, C; Distefano, C; Halladay, A; Ray, S; Porath, M; Wilson, R B; Thurm, A",J. intellect. dis. res,497,20

This study explored how dietary fat intake was impacted in a sample of the UK public who were social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Data were collected from a UK COVID-19 online survey. Fat intake was measured using the Dietary Instrument for Nutrition Education questionnaire. Anxiety and depressive symptoms were assessed using Becks' Anxiety and Depression Inventories, while the short-form Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale assessed mental well-being. Differences between individuals who increased versus decreased fat intake were explored using chi-square or independent sample t-tests. Association between fat intake and mental health was explored using adjusted linear regression models. RESULTS: Eight hundred and eighty-seven adults were included. Approximately, 34% recorded medium-to-high levels of fat consumption during social distancing. Around 48% reported decreased fat intake during social distancing compared to usual levels, while 41.3% documented increased fat intake. Fat intake was not significantly associated (P > 0.05) with any measures of mental health. CONCLUSIONS: A higher proportion of a sample of UK adults social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic recorded decreased fat intake when compared to levels prior to social distancing.

In Spring 2020, when ongoing the SARS-CoV-2 pandemics, the Veneto Region (V-R) has proposed setting-up an anti-SARS-CoV-2 CP (CCP) Bank, with the aim of preparing a supply of CCP immediately available in case of subsequest epidemic waves. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Key-points to be developed for a quick set-up of the V-R CCP Bank have been recruitment of donors recovered from COVID-19 infection, laboratory analysis for the biological qualification of the CCP units, including titre of neutralizing antibodies and reduction of pathogens, according to National Blood Centre (CNS) Directives, adaptation of the V-R Information Technology systems and cost analysis. Some activities, including diagnostic and viral inactivation processes, have been centralized in 2 or 3 sites. Laboratory analysis upon preliminary admission of the donor included all tests required by the Italian laws and the CNS directives. RESULTS: From April to August 2020, 3,298 people have contacted the V-R Blood Transfusion Services: of these, 1,632 have been evaluated and examined as first time donors and those found to be suitable have carried out 955 donations, from which 2,626 therapeutic fractions have been obtained, at a cost around 215,00 Euro. Since October 2020, the number of COVID-19 inpatients has had a surge with a heavy hospital overload. Moreover, the high request of CCP therapy by clinicians has been just as unexpected, showing a wide therapeutic use. CONCLUSIONS: The organizational model here presented, which has allowed the rapid collection of a large amount of CCP, could be useful when facing new pandemic outbreaks, especially in low and middle income countries, with generally acceptable costs.","De Silvestro, Giustina; Gandini, Giorgio; Fiorin, Francesco; Marson, Piero; Barbone, Ersilia; Frigato, Andrea; Gessoni, Gianluca; Veronesi, Arianna; Pacenti, Monia; Castelli, Monica; Rinaldi, Marianna; Rizzi, Monica; Stefani, Francesca; Roveroni, Giovanni",Transfus Apher Sci,497,1

The largest state, California, was also losing transit riders despite substantial public investment and increased service in the pre-pandemic period. This downturn prompted concern among transit managers and planners interested in service-side interventions to reverse the decline. However, relatively little is known about changes in the demand for public transit and how shifts in demand-side factors have affected patronage. Drawing on California data from the 2009 and 2017 National Household Travel Surveys, we quantify demand-side changes as a function of two factors—changes in ridership rates of various classes of transit riders (“rate effects”) and changes in the composition of those rider classes (“composition effects”). Statewide, we find that while shifts in the population composition were in some cases associated with lower levels of ridership, the largest declines in transit patronage were associated with falling ridership rates. Specifically, those with limited automobile access and Hispanic travelers rode transit far less frequently in 2017 compared to 2009. Transit ridership rates and rider composition in the San Francisco Bay Area were relatively stable during the study period, while both rate and compositional changes in the Los Angeles area were associated with much lower levels of total ridership. Overall, our findings demonstrate the important role of demand-side factors in understanding aggregate transit use, and suggest that planners and managers may have limited policy tools at their disposal when seeking to bolster ridership levels.","Schouten, Andrew Blumenberg Evelyn Taylor Brian D.",Travel Behaviour and Society,497,9

The outcomes of the plan are described in terms of observed safety events and drop-outs during the study period. RESULTS: A total of 130 patients were participating in 16 active clinical trials in Fundació ACE when the lockdown was established. During the confinement, we performed 1018 calls to the participants, which led to identify adverse events in 26 and COVID-19 symptoms in 6. A total of 83 patients (64%) could restart on-site visits as early as May 11, 2020. All SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR diagnostic tests performed before on-site visits were negative and only three IgG serological tests were positive. Throughout the study period, we only observed one drop-out, due to an adverse event unrelated to COVID-19.

Although most cases do not result in severe illness requiring hospitalization, there is increasing evidence that SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammation can exacerbate pre-existing diseases. We sought to describe the characteristics of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage who were actively or very recently infected with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We reviewed subarachnoid hemorrhage cases of patients who also were positive for SARS-CoV-2 at 5 high-volume cerebrovascular centers in the United States from March 2020 to January 2021. Cases of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 10 patients were identified, consisting of 5 women (50%) and 5 men (50%). Median age was 38.5 years. Four of the 10 patients (40%) were asymptomatic with respect to SARS-CoV-2-related symptoms, 3 patients (30%) had mild-to-moderate symptoms, and 3 patients (30%) had severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with pneumonia and sepsis.

However, it remains unknown to what extent progress has been achieved in the prevention of cancer in the proximal colon, distal colon, and rectum. METHODS: We analyzed trends in CRC incidence (2000-2016) and mortality (2000-2018) in Germany by sex, age, and tumor location. RESULTS: The age-standardized incidence of CRC declined by 22.4% (from 65.3 to 50.7 per 100 000) in men and by 25.5% (from 42.7 to 31.8 per 100 000) in women. CRC mortality declined by 35.8% (from 29.6 to 19.0 per 100 000) in men and by 40.5% (19.0 to 11.3 per 100 000) in women. Despite demographic changes, the annual numbers of CRC cases and deaths still decreased from about 60 400 to 58 300 and from around 28 700 to 24 200, respectively. The decline in incidence was greatest in groups aged &#8805; 55 years. While the incidence of cancer in the distal colon and rectum decreased by 34.5% and 26.2%, respectively, in men and by 41.0% and 27.9% in women, the incidence of proximal colon cancer remained stable in men and decreased by only 7.0% in women. However, a major shift towards earlier stages was observed for the proximal cancers. CONCLUSION: The results support the assumption that the increased use of colo - noscopy has contributed to substantial reductions in the incidence of distal CRC incidence and the mortality from cancers in the entire colon and rectum.","Cardoso, Rafael; Zhu, Anna; Guo, Feng; Heisser, Thomas; Hoffmeister, Michael; Brenner, Hermann",Dtsch Arztebl Int,497,15

Maternal influenza infection during pregnancy has been associated with the development of schizophrenia in offspring. Viral infections in neonates, children, and adolescents have also been associated with later development of schizophrenia. Neuroinvasive and/or systemic infections are thought to increase risk for psychopathology via inflammatory mechanisms, particularly when exposure occurs during critical neurodevelopmental windows. Several human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been associated with psychotic disorders and increasing reports of the neuropsychiatric manifestations of COVID-19 suggest it has neuroinvasive properties similar to those of other HCoVs. These properties, in conjunction with its ability to generate a massive inflammatory response, suggest that COVID-19 may also contribute to future psychopathology. This review will summarize the psychopathogenic mechanisms of viral infections and discuss the neuroinvasive and inflammatory properties of COVID-19 that could contribute to the development of psychotic disorders, with a focus on in utero, neonatal, and childhood exposure.","Kulaga, Stephanie S; Miller, Christopher W T",Neurosci Biobehav Rev,497,20

This is a tedious task which requires trained experts whose subjective assessment leads to low inter-rater agreement. An algorithm which can automatically predict the joint level damage in hands and feet can help optimize this process, which will eventually aid the doctors in better patient care and research. In this paper, we propose a two-staged approach which amalgamates object detection and convolution neural networks with attention which can efficiently and accurately predict the overall and joint level narrowing and erosion from patients radiographs. This approach has been evaluated on hands and feet radiographs of patients suffering from RA and has achieved a weighted root mean squared error (RMSE) of 1.358 and 1.404 in predicting joint level narrowing and erosion Sharp van der Heijde (SvH) scores which is 31% and 19% improvement with respect to the baseline SvH scores, respectively. The proposed approach achieved a weighted absolute error of 1.456 in predicting the overall damage in hands and feet radiographs for the patients which is a 79% improvement as compared to the baseline.

Till the time of this research, there was no effective and universally accepted vaccine to control transmission and spread of this infection. COVID-19 primarily spreads in population through respiratory droplets from an infected person cough and sneeze which infects people who are in proximity. COVID-19 is spreading contagiously across the world. If health policy makers and medical experts could get early and timely insights into when peak infection rate would occur after first reported case, they could plan and optimize medical personnel, ventilators supply, and other medical resources without over-taxing the infrastructure. The predictions may also help policymakers devise strategies to control the epidemic, potentially saving many lives. Thus, it can aid in critical decision-making process by providing actionable insights into COVID-19 outbreak by leveraging available data.","Tewari, Amit",,497,16

Clasificación clínica de casos y estratificación del riesgo de infección por SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19,15.907663,-1.2024668,2021,"BACKGROUND: High-income countries continuously reform their healthcare systems. Often, similar reforms are introduced concomitantly across countries. Although national policymakers would benefit from considering reform experiences abroad, exchange is limited. This paper provides an overview of health reform trends in 31 high-income countries in 2018 and 2019, i.e., before Covid-19. METHODS: Information was collected from national experts from the Health Systems and Policy Monitor network. Experts were asked to report on the three ""top"" national health reforms 2018 and 2019. In 2019, they provided an update of 2018 reforms. Reforms were assigned to one of 11 clusters and identified as one of seven different reform types. RESULTS: 81 reforms were reported in 28 countries in 2018. 44/81 went to four clusters: 'insurance coverage & resource generation', 'governance', 'healthcare purchasing & payment', and 'organisation of hospital care'. In 2019, 86 reforms in 30 countries were reported. 48/86 fell under 'organisation of primary & ambulatory care', 'governance', 'care coordination & specialised care', and 'organisation of hospital care'. Most 2018 reforms were reported ongoing in 2019; 27 implemented; seven abandoned. Health agency-led reforms were implemented most frequently, followed by central government-legislated reforms. CONCLUSIONS: Policymakers can leverage international experience of distinct reform approaches addressing similar challenges and similar approaches to address distinct problems. Such knowledge may help inspire or support future successful health reform processes.","Polin, Katherine; Hjortland, Maximilien; Maresso, Anna; van Ginneken, Ewout; Busse, Reinhard; Quentin, Wilm",Health policy,497,1

The antiviral drug remdesivir has been shown to shorten duration of disease while interferon beta-1b may speed up viral clearance. The results with hydroxychloroquine have thus far been rather disappointing. Trials with selective cytokine blockers including anti-interleukin-1 (anti-IL-1) and anti-interleukin-6 (anti-IL-6), have shown some promise in more severe cases, with further confirmation being required from large-scale phase-3 randomised controlled trials. The likelihood is that combination therapy addressing both upstream and downstream pathways may be required to prevent progression of severe COVID-19 infection in susceptible older patients with comorbidities and we believe further studies are now warranted to specifically target such at-risk groups who are more prone to worse outcomes.","Lipworth, Brian; Kuo, Chris RuiWen; Chan, Rory",J R Coll Physicians Edinb,497,15

The latter includes the use of electroencephalography (EEG) in clinical practice and research. We report a survey of the impact of COVID-19 on the use of clinical EEG in practice and research in several countries, and the recommendations of an international panel of experts for the safe application of EEG during and after this pandemic. METHODS: Fifteen clinicians from 8 different countries and 25 researchers from 13 different countries reported the impact of COVID-19 on their EEG activities, the procedures implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and precautions planned or already implemented during the reopening of EEG activities. RESULTS: Of the 15 clinical centers responding, 11 reported a total stoppage of all EEG activities, while 4 reduced the number of tests per day. In research settings, all 25 laboratories reported a complete stoppage of activity, with 7 laboratories reopening to some extent since initial closure. In both settings, recommended precautions for restarting or continuing EEG recording included strict hygienic rules, social distance, and assessment for infection symptoms among staff and patients/participants. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic interfered with the use of EEG recordings in clinical practice and even more in clinical research. We suggest updated best practices to allow safe EEG recordings in both research and clinical settings. The continued use of EEG is important in those with psychiatric diseases, particularly in times of social alarm such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Campanella, Salvatore; Arikan, Kemal; Babiloni, Claudio; Balconi, Michela; Bertollo, Maurizio; Betti, Viviana; Bianchi, Luigi; Brunovsky, Martin; Buttinelli, Carla; Comani, Silvia; Di Lorenzo, Giorgio; Dumalin, Daniel; Escera, Carles; Fallgatter, Andreas; Fisher, Derek; Giordano, Giulia Maria; Guntekin, Bahar; Imperatori, Claudio; Ishii, Ryouhei; Kajosch, Hendrik; Kiang, Michael; López-Caneda, Eduardo; Missonnier, Pascal; Mucci, Armida; Olbrich, Sebastian; Otte, Georges; Perrottelli, Andrea; Pizzuti, Alessandra; Pinal, Diego; Salisbury, Dean; Tang, Yingying; Tisei, Paolo; Wang, Jijun; Winkler, Istvan; Yuan, Jiajin; Pogarell, Oliver",Clin EEG Neurosci,497,8

The findings indicate an increase in depression and anxiety but have been limited by the lack of specificity about which aspects of the pandemic (e.g. viral exposure or economic threats) have led to adverse mental health outcomes. METHODS: Network analyses were conducted on data from wave 1 (N = 2025, recruited 23 March-28 March 2020) and wave 2 (N = 1406, recontacts 22 April-1 May 2020) of the COVID-19 Psychological Research Consortium Study, an online longitudinal survey of a representative sample of the UK adult population. Our models included depression (PHQ-9), generalized anxiety (GAD-7) and trauma symptoms (ITQ); and measures of COVID-specific anxiety, exposure to the virus in self and close others, as well as economic loss due to the pandemic. RESULTS: A mixed graphical model at wave 1 identified a potential pathway from economic adversity to anxiety symptoms via COVID-specific anxiety. There was no association between viral exposure and symptoms. Ising network models using clinical cut-offs for symptom scores at each wave yielded similar findings, with the exception of a modest effect of viral exposure on trauma symptoms at wave 1 only. Anxiety and depression symptoms formed separate clusters at wave 1 but not wave 2. CONCLUSIONS: The psychological impact of the pandemic evolved in the early phase of lockdown. COVID-related anxiety may represent the mechanism through which economic consequences of the pandemic are associated with psychiatric symptoms.","Zavlis, Orestis; Butter, Sarah; Bennett, Kate; Hartman, Todd K; Hyland, Philip; Mason, Liam; McBride, Orla; Murphy, Jamie; Gibson-Miller, Jilly; Levita, Liat; Martinez, Anton P; Shevlin, Mark; Stocks, Thomas V A; Vallières, Frédérique; Bentall, Richard P",Psychol Med,497,5

Twelve adults (50% females; 20-70 years) were interviewed between June and October (2020) via telephone or videoconferencing. Using a maximum variation strategy, participants with a range of sociodemographic characteristics, physical activity levels, and perceptions of seriousness and anxiety related to COVID-19 were selected. Semi-structured interviews captured participant perceptions of how their physical activity and perceptions of health changed during the pandemic. Using thematic analysis, four themes were identified: (1) Disruption to Daily Routines, (2) Changes in Physical Activity, (3) Balancing Health, and (4) Family Life. Participants experienced different degrees of disruption in their daily routines and physical activity based on their individual circumstances (e.g., pre-pandemic physical activity, family life, and access to resources). Although participants faced challenges in modifying their daily routines and physical activity, many adapted. Some participants reported enhanced feelings of well-being.

The objective of this research is to determine the cost-effectiveness of continuing to vaccinate all with a quadrivalent cell-based vaccine (QIVc) compared to returning to an at-risk only policy after the pandemic resolves. Methods: A dynamic transmission model, calibrated to match infection data from the UK, was used to estimate the clinical and economic impact of vaccination across 10 influenza seasons. The base case effectiveness of QIVc was 63.9% and the list price was GBP 9.94. Results: Vaccinating 50% of all 50-to 64-year-olds with QIVc reduced the average annual number of clinical infections (−682,000), hospitalizations (−5800) and deaths (−740) in the UK. The base case incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained (ICER) of all compared to at-risk only was GBP6000 (NHS perspective). When the cost of lost productivity was considered, vaccinating all 50-to 64-year-olds with QIVc became cost-saving. Conclusion: Vaccinating all 50-to 64-year-olds with QIVc is likely to be cost-effective. The NHS should consider continuing this policy in future seasons. © 2021 by the authors.

Four different temperatures were investigated corresponding to various weather conditions ranging from moderate (T = 16 degrees C and 25 degrees C) to more extreme conditions (T = 4 degrees C and 45 degrees C with a relative humidity of 30% and 60%). Numerical observations show that regardless of the ambient temperature, the traveled distance of the droplets in sneezing is longer (2.5 m) than in coughing (2 m). Current WHO guidelines indicate 1.8 m social distancing which might not be thus adequate. We demonstrate-for the first time-that evaporation depends on the gradient of the exhaled air temperature and the surrounding air rather than the ambient temperature itself. Larger droplets are more affected by the ambient conditions since due to gravity they more quickly leave the exhaled air cloud. Smaller ones are trapped longer in the exhaled air and evaporate quickly due to body temperature initial conditions. An additional important finding is that in both events, the droplet clouds evolve towards lower Stokes numbers supporting the hypothesis for increased aerosol transmission risk as time proceeds. Our work contributes to the better mapping of the droplet sizes and transmission route offering information hard to acquire experimentally for their dynamics in different times. These results help to guide public health policies to reduce the transmission of respi-ratory diseases, confirming the importance of social distancing to prevent them.","Gerbino, F.; Tretola, G.; Morgan, R.; Atkins, P.; Waddell, S.

Furthermore, Fluoxetine reduced viral infectivity in precision-cut human lung slices showing its activity in relevant human tissue targeted in severe infections. Fluoxetine treatment resulted in a decrease in viral protein expression. Fluoxetine is a racemate consisting of both stereoisomers, while the S-form is the dominant serotonin reuptake inhibitor. We found that both isomers show similar activity on the virus, indicating that the R-form might specifically be used for SARS-CoV-2 treatment.

The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of physical therapists regarding the professional and ethical issues they encountered during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The current study used reflexive thematic analysis, a qualitative research design developed by Braun and Clarke, to analyze individual interviews. RESULTS: Analysis of the coded interviews produced 6 primary themes (uncertainty, physical therapist's role, ethical dilemmas and moral distress, emotions, providing care and working conditions, and management and leadership influence) and associated subthemes. CONCLUSIONS: Physical therapists reported numerous professional and ethical issues across the individual, organizational, and societal realms during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study highlights the need for education and resources to prepare physical therapists for professional and ethical issues encountered during pandemics. Specifically, there is a need to define the physical therapist's role in pandemics and prepare the physical therapy personnel for dealing with ethical issues, stress, uncertainty, and organizational changes associated with pandemics. Ethical guidelines would support organizations in delineating fair processes for triage and allocation of scarce resources for acute care physical therapy during healthcare emergencies. IMPACT: The COVID-19 pandemic has produced significant changes in healthcare and physical therapist practice. This study reports results of the first research study focusing on professional and ethical issues experienced by physical therapists in acute care during the COVID-19 pandemic. As the US faces an unprecedented spike in COVID-19 cases and deaths, results of this study may contribute to physical therapists' preparation for and response to professional and ethical issues encountered in acute care during the pandemic.","Ditwiler, Rebecca E; Swisher, Laura L; Hardwick, Dustin D",Phys. ther,497,4

Currently, more than 100 million cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed worldwide, with over 2.4 million mortalities. The pandemic affects people of all ages but older individuals and those with severe chronic illnesses, including cancer patients, are at higher risk. PATIENT CONCERNS: The impact of cancer treatment on the progression of COVID-19 is unclear. Therefore, we assessed the effects of chemotherapy on COVID-19 outcomes for 2 cancer patients. On January 24, 2020, a level I response to a major public health emergency was initiated in Hubei Province, China, which includes Enshi Autonomous Prefecture that has a population of 4.026 million people. As of April 30, 2020, 252 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 11 asymptomatic carriers were identified in Enshi. DIAGNOSIS: Among the confirmed cases and asymptomatic carriers, 2 patients were identified who were previously diagnosed with malignant tumors, including one with hepatocellular carcinoma and the other with cardia carcinoma. INTERVENTIONS: These 2 patients were receiving or just completed chemotherapy at the time of their COVID-19 diagnosis. OUTCOMES: Both patients were followed and presented favorable outcomes. The positive outcomes for these 2 patients could be partially explained by their recent chemotherapy that impacted their immune status. Also, their relatively younger ages and lack of comorbidities were likely factors in their successful recovery from COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Anticancer treatment might enhance a patient's ability to respond favorably to COVID-19 infection. However, anticancer treatment is likely to impact immune function differently in different individuals, which can influence disease outcomes.","Ju, Zhaoqing; Yang, Jun; Lu, Gang; Li, Jian; Wu, Yun; Wu, Xiaofeng; Huang, Yanjie; Ai, Yi; Xiang, Dongfeng; Zeng, Bo; Yang, Zuwang; Gong, Nianqiao",Medicine (Baltimore),497,32

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A descriptive epidemiological study of 18 patients with COVID-19 in People's Hospital of Deyuan was carried out. Among these patients, 16 cases were connected with clusters (11 family-cluster cases and 5 public-cluster cases). The basic characteristics, clinical symptoms, and epidemiological characteristics of the patients were considered in the investigation. RESULTS: The median age of the 18 patients was 44.5 years (37.5-52.0 years), and there were 10 males and 8 females in the sample. The main clinical symptoms were fever and cough. The epidemiological characteristics were as follows: (1) the median incubation period was 8 days (with an interquartile range of 4-12 days); (2) the incubation period in one case was &#8805;18 days; (3) one infant patient was asymptomatic prior to their diagnosis; and (4) two asymptomatic patients had a positive nucleic acid test after their family members were diagnosed with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 can be transmitted in many ways, including via respiratory droplets and indirect contact, and it spreads easily among close contacts. People with a history of contact with areas affected by the disease should be isolated at home for 14 days. Moreover, attention should be focused on the issues of asymptomatic infectors, asymptomatic infants, and infants with mild symptoms.","Chen, G; Wu, M-Z; Qin, C-J; Wu, B-B; Luo, W-R; Liu, L; Liu, J-Y",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,497,16

STUDY DESIGN: Review. METHODS: A comprehensive literature review through an independent electronic search of the COVID-19 pandemic in PubMed, Medline, Google, and Google Scholar was performed on April 26-30, 2020. Resources identified comprised of published papers, national and international pediatric ENT society guidelines. RESULTS: Fourteen guidelines fit the inclusion criteria. Key statements were formulated and graded: 1) Strong recommendation (reported by 9 or more/14); 2) Fair recommendation (7-8/14); 3) Weak recommendation (5-6/14); and 4) Expert opinion (2-4/14). Any single source suggestion was included as a comment. Highly scored recommendations included definition of urgent/emergent cases that required surgery; surgery for acute airway obstruction; prompt diagnosis of suspected cancer; and surgical intervention for sepsis following initial first-line medical management. Other well scored recommendations included senior faculty to perform the surgery; the use of open approaches rather than endoscopic ones; and avoidance of powered instruments that would aerosolize virus-loaded tissue. A tracheostomy should be performed on a case by case basis where key technical modifications become necessary. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic will have a profound short and long-term impact on pediatric ENT practice. During this rapidly evolving climate, guidelines have been based on local practice and expert opinion. Until evidence-based practice in the COVID era is established, a comprehensive set of recommendations for pediatric ENT surgical practice based on a review of currently available literature and guidelines, is therefore, appropriate.

We hypothesized that this pandemic reduced referral of other non-COVID-19 patients to the hospitals or clinics, including gynecological and perinatological referrals. Women can be at risk in limited use of health services. METHODS: In this retrospective study, referrals from gynecologic oncology, perinatology, and gynecology clinics in a large teaching hospital of Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS) were compared from February 20 to May 20, 2020, with the same period in 2019. Finally, referral trends in 2020 were compared with the COVID-19 admission pattern. RESULTS: Total admissions to all three clinics declined 63% in 2020 compared to 2019. There was a significant relationship between the number of visits to three clinics during these2 years (p < 0.001). The reduction in referrals to the gynecology clinic was more than gynecologic oncology and perinatology. The COVID-19 referral pattern was conversely linked to gynecology-related admissions. CONCLUSION: As the pandemic situation makes patients hesitant to go to the hospitals or not, health policymakers should consider other non-COVID issues, including maternal and fetal concerns. Providing safe places for other patients to visit is a goal that can be achieved through developing guidelines for nosocomial hygiene and training informed healthcare staff. Moreover, non-urgent visits should be avoided or postponed. This issue calls for new strategies, including telemedicine in situations similar to the current pandemic to both identify and manage such conditions.","Khazaeipour, Zahra; Razavi, Erfan; Pahlevan-Fallahy, Mohammad-Taha",Arch Gynecol Obstet,497,20

We conducted a prospective observational cohort study of 210 consecutive SOTRs hospitalized with COVID-19 in 12 Spanish centers from 21 February to 6 May 2020. Data pertaining to demographics, chronic underlying diseases, transplantation features, clinical, therapeutics, and complications were collected. The primary endpoint was a composite of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and/or death. Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the factors associated with these unfavorable outcomes. Males accounted for 148 (70.5%) patients, the median age was 63 years, and 189 (90.0%) patients had pneumonia. Common symptoms were fever, cough, gastrointestinal disturbances, and dyspnea. The most used antiviral or host-targeted therapies included hydroxychloroquine 193/200 (96.5%), lopinavir/ritonavir 91/200 (45.5%), and tocilizumab 49/200 (24.5%). Thirty-seven (17.6%) patients required ICU admission, 12 (5.7%) suffered graft dysfunction, and 45 (21.4%) died. A shorter interval between transplantation and COVID-19 diagnosis had a negative impact on clinical prognosis. Four baseline features were identified as independent predictors of intensive care need or death: advanced age, high respiratory rate, lymphopenia, and elevated level of lactate dehydrogenase. In summary, this study presents comprehensive information on characteristics and complications of COVID-19 in hospitalized SOTRs and provides indicators available upon hospital admission for the identification of SOTRs at risk of critical disease or death, underlining the need for stringent preventative measures in the early post-transplant period.","Salto-Alejandre, Sonsoles; Jiménez-Jorge, Silvia; Sabé, Nuria; Ramos-Martínez, Antonio; Linares, Laura; Valerio, Maricela; Martín-Dávila, Pilar; Fernández-Ruiz, Mario; Fariñas, María Carmen; Blanes-Juliá, Marino; Vidal, Elisa; Palacios-Baena, Zaira R; Hernández-Gallego, Román; Carratalá, Jordi; Calderón-Parra, Jorge; Ángeles Marcos, María; Muñoz, Patricia; Fortún-Abete, Jesús; Aguado, José María; Arnaiz-Revillas, Francisco; Blanes-Hernández, Rosa; de la Torre-Cisneros, Julián; López-Cortés, Luis E; García de Vinuesa-Calvo, Elena; Rosso, Clara M; Pachón, Jerónimo; Sánchez-Céspedes, Javier; Cordero, Elisa",PLoS One,497,10

Scarce personal protective equipment (PPE) has forced them to conserve and reuse some of their PPE. The efficacy of these practices in preventing transmission of COVID-19 from patients to first responders is unclear. There are limited data on the prevalence of antibodies specific for COVID-19 exposure in these front-line workers. AIM: Our objective was to determine the prevalence of positive immunoglobulin G antibody specific to COVID-19 among first responders in Lubbock, Texas. METHODS: Blood samples were collected on 683 asymptomatic first responders who work in Lubbock, Texas and the surrounding area, after informed consents were signed. IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 was measured using Abbott's SARS-CoV-2 IgG Reagent Kit in combination with the SARS-CoV-2 IgG Calibrator Kit on the Abbott's ARCHITECT i1000SR analyzer. RESULTS: The prevalence of IgG specific antibodies to COVID-19 was 0.73%, five of the 683 participants tested positive. Four of those who tested positive had no known prior SARS-CoV-2 infection or exposure without adequate PPE. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of IgG specific antibodies to COVID-19 was much lower than expected in our study population despite high sensitivity and specificity of the test reagent. The most likely explanations for this finding include limited exposure, inadequate time for a IgG response, possible clearance of COVID-19 infection locally by the respiratory tract IgA defense system without eliciting a systemic IgG response, and short persistence of IgG antibodies in mild or asymptomatic cases.","Iwuji, Kenneth; Islam, Ebtesam; Berdine, Gilbert; Nugent, Kenneth; Test, Victor; Tijerina, Amanda",J Prim Care Community Health,497,6

The high contagiousness of the virus, the strong impact on the health system of the various countries and the absence to date of treatments able to improve the prognosis of the disease make the introduction of a vaccine indispensable, even though there are currently no approved human coronavirus vaccines. The aim of the study is to carry out a review of the medical literature concerning vaccine candidates for the main coronaviruses responsible for human epidemics, including recent advances in the development of a vaccine against COVID-19. This extensive review carried out on the vaccine candidates of the main epidemic coronaviruses of the past has shown that the studies in animal models suggest a high efficacy of potential vaccines in providing protection against viral challenges. Similar human studies have not yet been carried out, as the main trials are aimed at assessing mainly vaccine safety and immunogenicity. Whereas the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) epidemic ended almost two decades ago and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) epidemic is now better controlled, as it is less contagious due to the high lethality of the virus, the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic represents a problem that is certainly more compelling, which pushes us to accelerate the studies not only for the production of vaccines but also for innovative pharmacological treatments. SARS-CoV-2 vaccines might come too late to affect the first wave of this pandemic, but they might be useful if additional subsequent waves occur or in a post-pandemic perspective in which the virus continues to circulate as a seasonal virus.","Conte, Cristiano; Sogni, Francesco; Affanni, Paola; Veronesi, Licia; Argentiero, Alberto; Esposito, Susanna",,497,6

SARS-CoV-2, similar to other previously identified Coronaviridae family members, encodes several structural proteins, such as spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid, that are responsible for host penetration, binding, recycling, and pathogenesis. Structural biology has been a key player in understanding the viral infection mechanism and in developing intervention strategies against the new coronavirus. The spike glycoprotein has drawn considerable attention as a means to block viral entry owing to its interactions with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which acts as a receptor.

Coronaviruses are a large family of single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses. The virus has four essential structural proteins which include the spike (S) glycoprotein, matrix (M) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein and small envelope (E) protein. Different technologies are being used for vaccine development to battle the pandemic. There are messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)-based vaccines, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) vaccines, inactivated viral vaccines, live attenuated vaccines, protein subunit-based vaccines, viral vector-based vaccines and viruslike particle-based vaccines. Vaccine development has five stages. In the clinical developmental stage, vaccine development can be sped up by combining phase 1 and 2. The vaccines can also be approved more swiftly on an emergent basis and released sooner for usage. The United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) has approved Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Janssen coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines for emergency use. There are other vaccines that have been approved around the world. The mRNA vaccines have been created using a novel technology and they contain a synthetically created RNA sequence of virus fragments encoding the S-protein which is injected. These vaccines have a relatively low cost of production and faster manufacturing time but can have comparatively lower immunogenicity and more than one dose of vaccine may be required. In the case of viral vector-based vaccines, genes encoding the SARS-CoV-2 S protein are isolated and following gene sequencings are introduced into the adenovirus vector. These vaccines have a relatively fast manufacturing time but the efficacy of the vaccine is variable based on the host’s immune response to the viral vector. At the time of this paper, there were 81 vaccines in clinical development stage and 182 vaccines in preclinical development stage. Vaccines are an essential tool in our battle against COVID-19. Some of the COVID-19 vaccines have completed their phase III trials while many other potential vaccines are still in developmental stages. It used to take close to a decade for a vaccine to be developed and undergo rigorous testing until its production and availability to the public, but over the past year, we have seen multiple vaccines in different phases of testing against SARS-CoV-2 virus. © The authors Journal compilation ©","Vasireddy, D.; Atluri, P.; Malayala, S.

Our purpose was to determine which disparities are most prevalent and their impact on length of stay (LoS) and in hospital mortality in patients diagnosed with Covid-19. MethodsDe-Identified data for patients who tested positive for COVID-19 was abstracted from the HCA enterprise database. Data was binned into summary tables. A negative binomial regression with LoS as the dependent variable and a logistic regression of in-hospital mortality data, using age, insurance status, sex, comorbidities as the dependent variables, were performed. ResultsFrom March 1, 2020 to August 23, 2020, of 111,849 covid testing patient records, excluding those with missing data (n=7), without confirmed COVID-19 (n=27,225), and those from a carceral environment (n=1,861), left 84,624 eligible patients. Compared to the US population, the covid cohort had more black patients (23.17% vs 13.4%). Compared to the white cohort, the black cohort had higher private insurance rates (28.52% vs. 23.68%), shorter LoS (IRR=0.97 CI=0.95-0.99, P<0.01) and lower adjusted mortality (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.75-0.97). Increasing age was associated with increased mortality and LoS. Patients with Medicare or Medicaid had longer LoS (IRR=1.07, 95% CI=1.04-1.09) and higher adjusted mortality rates (OR=1.11, 95% CI=1-1.23) than those with private insurance ConclusionConclusions We found that when blacks have higher rates of private insurance, they have shorter hospitalizations and lower mortality than whites, when diagnosed with Covid-19. Some other psychiatric and medical conditions also significantly impacted outcomes in patients with Covid-19. Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhich social determinants of health and comorbidities are most prevalent and their impact on length of stay and in-hospital mortality in patients diagnosed with Covid-19? FindingsIn this retrospective cohort of 84,624 with the black cohort having higher private insurance rates (28.52% vs. 23.68%), there was shorter LoS (IRR=0.97 CI=0.95-0.99, P<0.01) and lower adjusted mortality (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.75-0.97). Age and several other medical and psychiatric comorbidities were also found to correlate with length of stay and mortality. MeaningThe genetics of race is not important in predicting mortality and length of stay in COVID-19 patients, but age, comorbidities, and insurance status appear to have a significant difference in mortality and length of stay.","Delora, Adam; Mills, Ashlynn; Jacobson, David; Cornett, Brendon; Peacock, W.

Building on a recent model of how semantic relations can be learned from non-relational word embeddings, we present a new computational model of mapping between two analogs. The model adopts a Bayesian framework for probabilistic graph matching, operating on semantic relation networks constructed from distributed representations of individual concepts and of relations between concepts. Through comparisons of model predictions with human performance in a novel mapping task requiring integration of multiple relations, as well as in several classic studies, we demonstrate that the model accounts for a broad range of phenomena involving analogical mapping by both adults and children. We also show the potential for extending the model to deal with analog retrieval. Our approach demonstrates that human-like analogical mapping can emerge from comparison mechanisms applied to rich semantic representations of individual concepts and relations.","Lu, Hongjing; Ichien, Nicholas; Holyoak, Keith J.",,497,21

This study estimated the safety and reactogenicity of the ChAdOx1-S vaccine after the first dose administered to adults. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 1592 randomly selected vaccinees from April to May 2021. A questionnaire was delivered to the vaccinees via phone calls 7 and 21 days after the first vaccine dose. RESULTS: Of the 1592 vaccinees who had the first dose, the mean age was 37.4 (± 9.6) years and 81% were males. Of all the vaccinees, 553 (34.7%) reported an adverse reaction on the first telephone call. The most common symptoms were: pain at the site of injection (485, 30.5%), musculoskeletal symptoms (438, 27.5%), skin rash (307, 19.2%), gastrointestinal symptoms (379, 23.8%) and fever (498, 31.3%). Men were more likely to report fever (76.9% vs. 23.1%; P = 0.005), skin rash (81.1% vs. 18.9%, P = 0.005) and pain at the injection site (77.3% vs. 22.7%, P < 0.0001). Post-vaccine COVID-19 infection was 0.5% and there were no hospitalizations. CONCLUSION: This study observed no major side effects of the ChAdOx1-S vaccine and no reported breakthrough infection during the observation period.","Al Bahrani, Salma; Albarrak, Ali; Alghamdi, Othman Ali; Alghamdi, Mesfer Abdullah; Hakami, Fatimah H; Al Abaadi, Asmaa K; Alkhrashi, Sausan A; Alghamdi, Mansour Y; Almershad, Meshael M; Alenazi, Mansour Moklif; El Gezery, Mohamed Hany; Jebakumar, Arulanantham Zechariah; Al-Tawfiq, Jaffar A",Int J Infect Dis,497,12

This cross-sectional study examined in a sample of 207 cyclists (M age = 26.81) whether different motivational profiles can be identified and whether these profile differences relate to (a) the extent to which cyclists get their basic psychological needs satisfied during this pandemic and (b) the type of self-regulation strategies cyclists use to motivate themselves to continue their training. Cluster analyses revealed four motivational profiles (i.e., a good quality, high quantity, low quantity, and poor quality profile) that differed in terms of autonomous motivation, controlled motivation, and amotivation. Results indicated that the profile characterised by autonomous motivation (i.e., good quality) yielded the most adaptive outcomes, while the profile characterised by the combination of controlled motivation and amotivation (i.e., poor quality) yielded the least optimal outcomes. This research shows that cyclists’ capacity to cope with the pandemic in a resilient way depends on the presence of both a sufficient dose and high-quality motivation. © 2021 International Society of Sport Psychology.","Morbée, S.; Haerens, L.; Waterschoot, J.; Vansteenkiste, M.",International Journal of Sport and Exercise Psychology,497,1

The purpose of this prospective study was to report incidence and transmission regarding SARS-CoV-2, of professional golfers competing on the PGA European Tour across 23 events in 11 countries.MethodsDaily symptom and temperature checks and weekly reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) screening were performed to determine potential carriage of SARS-CoV-2. Onset and type of symptomology were analysed. Gene expression and cycle thresholds (Cts) were reviewed for all positive cases. Repeat PCR testing was performed on all positive players. RT-PCR analysis included human housekeeping genes and various RNA genes specific for SARS-CoV-2.ResultsDuring the study period, there were 2900 RT-PCR tests performed on 195 professional golfers competing on the European Tour. Four players tested positive on-site during the study period (0.14% of tests;positive results were declared with Ct &lt;40). Two positive tests were returned as part of routine protocols, while two reported a history of close contact with an individual who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were isolated and target tested. All were asymptomatic at time of testing, with three developing symptoms subsequently. None required hospital admission. There was no transmission from player to player.ConclusionGolf is an outdoor sport where social distancing is possible, meaning risks can be low if guidance is followed by participants. Risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 can be mitigated by highly accurate RT-PCR testing of participants and by setting up a safe bubble that includes testing players and support staff, as well as all persons coming into contact with them during the course of the tournament, for example, drivers and hotel staff. This report can also provide reassurance for participants and policy makers regarding community golf, which can be encouraged for the health benefits it provides, in a relatively low-risk environment, with minimal risk of transmission by observing sensible viral hygiene protocols.","Robinson, Patrick G.; Murray, Andrew Close Graeme Kinane Denis F.",BMJ Open Sport &amp; Exercise Medicine,497,16

It has previously been found to be associated with youth, female gender, low income, low education, low medical trust, minority ethnic group membership, low perceived risk from COVID-19, use of certain social media platforms and conspiracy beliefs. However, it is unclear which of these predictors might explain variance associated with others. METHODS: An online survey was conducted with a representative sample of 4343 UK residents, aged 18-75, between 21 November and 21 December 2020. Predictors of vaccine hesitancy were assessed using linear rank-order models. RESULTS: Coronavirus vaccine hesitancy is associated with youth, female gender, low income, low education, high informational reliance on social media, low informational reliance on print and broadcast media, membership of other than white ethnic groups, low perceived risk from COVID-19 and low trust in scientists and medics, as well as (to a much lesser extent) low trust in government. Coronavirus conspiracy suspicions and general vaccine attitudes appear uniquely predictive, jointly explaining 35% of variance. Following controls for these variables, effects associated with trust, ethnicity and social media reliance largely or completely disappear, whereas the effect associated with education is reversed. CONCLUSIONS: Strengthening positive attitudes to vaccination and reducing conspiracy suspicions with regards to the coronavirus may have a positive effect on vaccine uptake, especially among ethnic groups with heightened vaccine hesitancy.

Severe respiratory symptoms are a hallmark of the disease, which may also include complications related to a hypercoagulable state and central nervous system involvement. These complications can occur during either the acute or the recovery phase. The cerebral involvement typically manifests as intracranial hypertension, intracerebral hemorrhage, diffuse encephalopathy, or cerebral venous thrombosis. The hemorrhagic form of cerebral venous thrombosis can be a diagnostic challenge and is treated by anticoagulation therapy, despite the existence of an intracerebral hemorrhage. This report describes a case of superficial cerebral venous thrombosis and intracerebral hematoma in a 48-year-old man weeks after recovering from the acute phase of SARSCoV-2 infection. CASE REPORT A 48-year-old man with a past medical history of SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction presented with left upper-limb numbness, weakness, and impaired positional sensorium. After initial stabilization, noncontrast computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed an intracerebral hemorrhage with underlying cerebral venous thrombosis.

Black adolescents are among the most vulnerable to COVID-19, have high mental health service needs, and have low mental health services utilization. During this time of great physical threat due to COVID-19, it is equally important to understand and support the mental health of Black adolescents. METHOD: This study collected open-ended survey item responses from adolescents (12-17 years old) that identified as Black, living in a city in the Southeastern United States (n = 33). Grounded theory was used to analyze the data, revealing details of the lived experience of these Black adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Black adolescents reported that COVID-19 has been both positive and negative for them. Family is of utmost importance to them, as are their peers, whom they do not get to interact with due to changes in the operation of schools. Despite experiencing stress, adaptive responses to COVID-19 are reported. Black adolescents continue to cite issues with mental health services and providers. Financial issues were a common theme for these youth, blocking access to services and causing issues in the home environment. CONCLUSIONS: Mental health service providers must address the service access and quality issues repeatedly reported by Black adolescents. Direct action must be taken to facilitate an increase in Black adolescents mental health services utilization and satisfaction. Changes are needed at the individual and macro levels to alter the experience of one of our most vulnerable groups.","Banks, Andrae",J. racial ethnic health disparities (Internet),497,20

Given their particular link with humans, which act as both initiators and suppressors, wildfire hazard is highly sensitive to socioeconomic changes and patterns. Many researchers have prompted the perils of sustaining the current management policy, the so-called 'total fire exclusion'. This policy, coupled to increasingly fire-prone weather conditions, may lead to more hazardous fires in the mid-long run. Under this framework, the irruption of the COVID-19 pandemic adds to the ongoing situation. Facing the lack of an effective treatment, the only alternative was the implementation of strict lockdown strategies. The virtual halt of the system undoubtedly affected economic and social behavior, triggering cascading effects such as the drop in winter-spring wildfire activity. In this work, we discuss the main impacts, challenges and consequences that wildfire science may experience due to the pandemic situation, and identify potential opportunities for wildfire management. We investigate the recent evolution of burned area (retrieved from the MCD64A1 v006 MODIS product) in the EU Mediterranean region (Portugal, Spain, France, Italy and Greece) to ascertain to what extent the 2020 winter-spring season was impacted by the public health response to COVID-19 (curfews and lockdowns). We accounted for weather conditions (characterized using the 6-month Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index; SPEI6) to disregard possible weather effects mediating fire activity. Our results suggest that, under similar drought-related circumstances (SPEI6 &#8776; -0.7), the expected burned area in 2020 during the lockdown period in the EU (March-May) would lay somewhere within the range of 38,800 ha ± 18,379 ha. Instead, the affected area stands one order of magnitude below average (3325 ha). This stresses the need of considering the social dimension in the analysis of current and future wildfire impacts in the Mediterranean region.","Rodrigues, Marcos; Gelabert, Pere J; Ameztegui, Aitor; Coll, Lluis; Vega-García, Cristina",Sci Total Environ,497,1

However, whether poor cognitive functions and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) traits affect the therapeutic response of patients with OCD to ERP-based CBT remains unclear. This study aimed to identify factors predictive of the therapeutic response of Japanese patients with OCD to ERP-based CBT. METHODS: Forty-two Japanese outpatients with OCD were assessed using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III (WAIS-III), Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item scale, and Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) at pre- and post-treatment. We used multiple regression analyses to estimate the effect on therapeutic response change. The treatment response change was set as a dependent variable in multiple regression analyses. RESULTS: Multiple regression analyses showed that among independent variables, communication as an AQ sub-scale and Letter Number Sequencing as a WAIS-III sub-test predict the therapeutic response to ERP-based CBT . CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that diminished working memory (Letter Number Sequencing), poor communication skill (AQ sub-scale) may undermine responsiveness to ERP-based CBT among patients with OCD.

Previous research has indicated that loss of employment is associated with mental illness and increased alcohol consumption. However, no studies have explored this relationship in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.Objective: The purpose was twofold: (1) Evaluate the association between pandemic-related employment status and alcohol consumption and (2) assess the interacting effect of depression and employment change on alcohol consumption. We hypothesized that (1) employment change would be associated with increased alcohol consumption during the pandemic and (2) the combined effects of depressive symptoms with pandemic-related-employment-change would strengthen the association with alcohol consumption.Methods: A self-report, web-based survey collected information on sociodemographics, COVID-19-related employment impact (e.g., decreased pay, laid off), change in alcohol consumption since the pandemic, reasons for consumption change, and depressive symptoms. Multinomial regression modeling explored the associations between variables.Results: One-third (33%) of participants (n = 2,441; 67% female) reported consuming more alcohol compared to pre-pandemic and 11% reported that COVID-19 had a negative impact on their employment. Participants reported drinking more alcohol due to having more time (28%) or boredom (22%). The adjusted odds of increased alcohol consumption were 47% greater among those who reported negative employment impact compared to those who reported no employment impact (AOR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.03-2.11); depression did not moderate this relationship.Conclusion: Given the pandemic's far-reaching impact, the potential for alcohol harm is demonstrably great.

Importation of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) from China and elsewhere into the UK highlights the need to understand the impact of contact tracing as a control measure. DESIGN: Detailed survey information on social encounters from over 5800 respondents is coupled to predictive models of contact tracing and control. This is used to investigate the likely efficacy of contact tracing and the distribution of secondary cases that may go untraced. RESULTS: Taking recent estimates for COVID-19 transmission we predict that under effective contact tracing less than 1 in 6 cases will generate any subsequent untraced infections, although this comes at a high logistical burden with an average of 36 individuals traced per case. Changes to the definition of a close contact can reduce this burden, but with increased risk of untraced cases; we find that tracing using a contact definition requiring more than 4 hours of contact is unlikely to control spread. CONCLUSIONS: The current contact tracing strategy within the UK is likely to identify a sufficient proportion of infected individuals such that subsequent spread could be prevented, although the ultimate success will depend on the rapid detection of cases and isolation of contacts. Given the burden of tracing a large number of contacts to find new cases, there is the potential the system could be overwhelmed if imports of infection occur at a rapid rate.","Keeling, Matt J; Hollingsworth, T Deirdre; Read, Jonathan M",J Epidemiol Community Health,497,26

We studied the relationship among anti-spike ectodomain (anti-ECD), anti-receptor-binding domain (anti-RBD) IgG titers, and SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization (VN) titers generated by 2 in vitro assays using convalescent plasma samples from 68 patients with COVID-19. We report a strong positive correlation between both plasma anti-RBD and anti-ECD IgG titers and in vitro VN titers. The probability of a VN titer of &#8805;160, the FDA-recommended level for convalescent plasma used for COVID-19 treatment, was &#8805;80% when anti-RBD or anti-ECD titers were &#8805;1:1350. Of all donors, 37% lacked VN titers of &#8805;160. Dyspnea, hospitalization, and disease severity were significantly associated with higher VN titer. Frequent donation of convalescent plasma did not significantly decrease VN or IgG titers. Analysis of 2814 asymptomatic adults found 73 individuals with anti-ECD IgG titers of &#8805;1:50 and strong positive correlation with anti-RBD and VN titers. Fourteen of these individuals had VN titers of &#8805;1:160, and all of them had anti-RBD titers of &#8805;1:1350. We conclude that anti-RBD or anti-ECD IgG titers can serve as a surrogate for VN titers to identify suitable plasma donors. Plasma anti-RBD or anti-ECD titers of &#8805;1:1350 may provide critical information about protection against COVID-19 disease.","Salazar, Eric; Kuchipudi, Suresh V; Christensen, Paul A; Eagar, Todd; Yi, Xin; Zhao, Picheng; Jin, Zhicheng; Long, S Wesley; Olsen, Randall J; Chen, Jian; Castillo, Brian; Leveque, Christopher; Towers, Dalton; Lavinder, Jason; Gollihar, Jimmy; Cardona, Jose; Ippolito, Gregory; Nissly, Ruth; Bird, Ian; Greenawalt, Denver; Rossi, Randall M; Gontu, Abhinay; Srinivasan, Sreenidhi; Poojary, Indira; Cattadori, Isabella M; Hudson, Peter J; Josleyn, Nicole M; Prugar, Laura; Huie, Kathleen; Herbert, Andrew; Bernard, David W; Dye, John M; Kapur, Vivek; Musser, James M",J. clin. invest,497,15

Blood glucose level is an important risk factor for the prognosis of infection and critically ill patients. We aimed to investigate the prognostic value of blood glucose level in patients with COVID-19. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We collected clinical and survival information of 2041 consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 from two medical centers in Wuhan. Patients without available blood glucose level were excluded. We performed multivariable Cox regression to calculate HRs of blood glucose-associated indexes for the risk of progression to critical cases/mortality among non-critical cases, as well as in-hospital mortality in critical cases. Sensitivity analysis were conducted in patient without diabetes. RESULTS: Elevation of admission blood glucose level was an independent risk factor for progression to critical cases/death among non-critical cases (HR=1.30, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.63, p=0.026). Elevation of initial blood glucose level of critical diagnosis was an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality in critical cases (HR=1.84, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.98, p=0.013). Higher median glucose level during hospital stay or after critical diagnosis (&#8805;6.1 mmol/L) was independently associated with increased risks of progression to critical cases/death among non-critical cases, as well as in-hospital mortality in critical cases. Above results were consistent in the sensitivity analysis in patients without diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Elevation of blood glucose level predicted worse outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Our findings may provide a simple and practical way to risk stratify COVID-19 inpatients for hierarchical management, particularly where medical resources are in severe shortage during the pandemic.","Wu, Jianfeng; Huang, Jianqiang; Zhu, Guochao; Wang, Qiongya; Lv, Qingquan; Huang, Ying; Yu, Yang; Si, Xiang; Yi, Hui; Wang, Cuiping; Liu, Yihao; Xiao, Han; Zhou, Qian; Liu, Xin; Yang, Daya; Guan, Xiangdong; Li, Yanbing; Peng, Sui; Sung, Joseph; Xiao, Haipeng",,497,16

This includes new innovative technologies and strategies being developed by educators to foster the rapid learning-recovery and reinstatement of the stakeholders (e.g., teachers and students). Indeed, the main challenge for educators has been on what appropriate steps should be taken to prevent learning loss for the students; ranging from how to provide efficient learning tools/curriculum that ensures continuity of learning, to provision of methods that incorporate coping mechanisms and acceleration of education in general. For several higher educational institutions (HEIs), technology-mediated education has become an integral part of the modern teaching/learning instruction amidst the Covid-19 pandemic, when digital technologies have consequently become an inevitable and indispensable part of learning. To this effect, this study defines a hybrid educational model (HyFlex + Tec) used to enable virtual and in-person education in the HEIs. Practically, the study utilized data usage report from Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and Emotions and Experience Survey questionnaire in a higher education setting for its experiments. To this end, we applied an Exponential Linear trend model and Forecasting method to determine overall progress and statistics for the learners during the Covid-19 pandemic, and subsequently performed a Text Mining and Univariate Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to determine effects and significant differences that the teaching-learning experiences for the teachers and students have on their energy (learning motivation) levels. From the results, we note that the hybrid learning model supports continuity of education/learning for teachers and students during the Covid-19 pandemic. The study also discusses its innovative importance for future monitoring (tracking) of learning experiences and emotional well-being for the stakeholders in leu (aftermath) of the Covid-19 pandemic.","Okoye, Kingsley; Rodriguez-Tort, Jorge Alfonso; Escamilla, Jose; Hosseini, Samira",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),497,16

However, traditional air quality assessments may fail to provide comprehensive, real-time monitoring of air quality because of the sparse distribution of air quality monitoring stations. Overcoming some key limitations of traditional surface monitoring data, Web-based social media platforms, such as Twitter, Weibo, and Facebook, provide a promising tool and novel perspective for environmental monitoring, prediction, and evaluation. This study aims to investigate the relationship between PM2.5 levels and people's emotional intensity by observing social media postings. This study defines the ""emotional intensity"" indicator, which is measured by the number of negative posts on Weibo, based on Weibo data related to haze from 2016 and 2017. This study estimates sentiment polarity using a recurrent neural networks model based on LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and verifies the correlation between high PM2.5 levels and negative posts on Weibo using a Pearson correlation coefficient and multiple linear regression model. This study makes the following observations: (1) Taking the two-year data as an example, this study recorded the significant influence of PM2.5 levels on netizens' posting behavior. (2) Air quality, meteorological factors, the seasons, and other factors have a strong influence on netizens' emotional intensity. (3) From a quantitative viewpoint, the level of PM2.5 varies by 1 unit, and the number of negative Weibo posts fluctuates by 1.0168 units. Thus, it can be concluded that netizens' emotional intensity is significantly positively affected by levels of PM2.5. The high correlation between PM2.5 levels and emotional intensity and the sensitivity of social media data shows that social media data can be used to provide a new perspective on the assessment of air quality.","Shan, Siqing; Ju, Xijie; Wei, Yigang; Wang, Zijin",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),497,16

The survey inquired about respondents´ motivation to comply with a social distancing strategy and their ability to adopt 3 recommended social distancing strategies (avoiding public transport without wearing facemask, avoiding public gatherings and self-isolation). Respondents were also asked about the level of trust they had in the information about COVID-19 from the government and their confidence in the handling of the COVID-19 situation by the authorities. Fifty two percent (52%) of respondents reported that they would be motivated to comply with a social distancing strategy because they believed it is the right thing to do. Avoiding public transport without wearing facemask (n=154, 78.9%), followed by avoiding public gatherings (n=143, 73.3%) were considered to have high to very high capacity to adopt ratings among respondents.

The aim of this work is to present how the integration of machine learning approaches with mechanistic computational modelling could yield a reliable infrastructure to run probabilistic simulations where the entire organism is considered as a whole. Methods: We propose a general framework that composes advanced AI approaches and integrates mathematical modelling in order to provide a panoramic view over current and future physiological conditions. The proposed architecture is based on a graph neural network (GNNs) forecasting clinically relevant endpoints (such as blood pressure) and a generative adversarial network (GANs) providing a proof of concept of transcriptomic integrability. Results: We show the results of the investigation of pathological effects of overexpression of ACE2 across different signalling pathways in multiple tissues on cardiovascular functions. We provide a proof of concept of integrating a large set of composable clinical models using molecular data to drive local and global clinical parameters and derive future trajectories representing the evolution of the physiological state of the patient. Significance: We argue that the graph representation of a computational patient has potential to solve important technological challenges in integrating multiscale computational modelling with AI.

Lettre de la Société Française de Médecine du Travail,16.138752,-1.394889,2020,"BACKGROUND: A rapidly evolving evidence suggests that smell and taste disturbance are common symptoms in COVID-19 infection. As yet there are no reports on duration and recovery rates. We set out to characterise patients reporting new onset smell and taste disturbance during the COVID-19 pandemic and report on early recovery rates. METHODS: Online Survey of patients reporting self-diagnosed new onset smell and taste disturbance during the COVID-19 pandemic, with 1 week follow-up. RESULTS: Three hundred eighty-two patents completed bot an initial and follow-up survey. 86.4% reported complete anosmia and a further 11.5% a very severe loss of smell at the time of completing the first survey. At follow-up 1 week later, there is already significant improvement in self-rating of severity of olfactory loss. 80.1% report lower severity scores at follow-up, 17.6% are unchanged and 1.9% are worse. 11.5% already report compete resolution at follow up, while 17.3% report persistent complete loss of smell, with reported duration being 1 to over 4 weeks. This is reflected in the overall cumulative improvement rate of 79% patients overall in the interval between surveys. CONCLUSIONS: A review of the growing evidence base supports the likelihood that out cohort have suffered olfactory loss as part of COVID-19 infection. While early recovery rates are encouraging, long term rates will need to be further investigated and there may be an increase in patients with persistent post-viral loss as a result of the pandemic. We further call for loss of sense of smell to be formerly recognised as a marker of COVID-19 infection.","Hopkins, Claire; Surda, Pavol; Whitehead, Emily; Kumar, B Nirmal",J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,497,16

Therefore, we examined differences in body composition by sex and obesity status in Finnish preschool-aged children and within-individual changes in body composition in normal and overweight children. SUBJECT/METHODS: Body composition was measured using segmental multifrequency bioimpedance analysis (BIA) in 476 children and in 781 children at age 3 and 5 years, respectively. Of those, 308 had repeated BIA measurements at both ages. BMI-SDS was used for classification of normal weight and overweight children. RESULTS: Sex difference in the amount of lean mass (LM) was already seen at 3 years of age (boys 11.7 kg, girls 11.3 kg; p < 0.001). At 5 years of age, boys had lower fat mass (FM; 3.6 kg vs. 3.9 kg, p < 0.001), lower percent fat mass (%FM; 17.2% vs. 19.1%; p < 0.001), and higher LM (16.0 kg vs. 15.2 kg; p < 0.001) than girls. Overweight children had higher values in FM, %FM, and LM compared with normal weight peers at both ages. Among normal weight children, the increase of LM by age was associated with only minor changes in FM, whereas children who were or became overweight both LM and FM was substantially increased between 3 and 5 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: BIA-assessed body composition differs by sex and obesity status already at age of 3 years. For children who are or become overweight at very young age, the patterns for the changes in LM and FM by age are different than for normal weight children.","Leskinen, Tuija; Eloranta, Aino-Maija; Tompuri, Tuomo; Saari, Antti; Ollila, Helena; Mäkelä, Johanna; Niinikoski, Harri; Lagström, Hanna",Eur. j. clin. nutr,497,16

We use multilevel generalized linear regression models with violent victimization (robbery and assault) regressed on demographic, family, school, and neighborhood variables. Multiplicative interaction terms are included in separate models to examine key moderation effects consistent with expectations drawn from the victimization literature. Analyses reveal that low self-control and perceptions of school disorganization are both associated with an increase in the odds of experiencing victimization. Interactions between low self-control and school disorganization are also found to be consistent with saturation/social push models. Our regulation approach offers a foundation for theorizing about ETV and provides a testable model for future research. However, elements of the regulation model are in need of further refinement and testing before the perspective can be moved toward a broader theory of victimization.","Posick, Chad; Rocque, Michael",J Interpers Violence,497,30

Therefore, this study aimed to explore factors associated with health services utilization among breast cancer patients during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak. METHOD: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among 151 women with breast cancer. Participants completed measures of perceived health status, perceived susceptibility to COVID-19, anxiety, coping resources, health services utilization (contact with healthcare professionals and cancellation of an appointment to the oncology/hematology clinic), and socio-demographic questionnaires. A multiple hierarchical regression was calculated; contact with healthcare professionals was the dependent variable. In addition, a logistic regression was calculated; cancellation of an appointment to the oncology/hematology clinic because of the COVID-19 was the dependent variable. RESULTS: Breast cancer patients' contact with healthcare professionals was lower than their contact prior to the pandemic. A higher extent of contact with healthcare professionals was related to patients' perception of health as bad/reasonable, lower perceived susceptibility, a lower sense of mastery, and higher social support. In addition, the odds of cancelling an appointment to the oncology/hematology clinic were higher in the presence of additional chronic illnesses and a higher sense of mastery. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: The results could provide public health agencies with a more complete picture of the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic among breast cancer patients. This is significant because, in the event that COVID-19 re-emerges, the findings of the current study could help guide public health officials and possibly prevent the future avoidance of health services' use among this high-risk population.","Shinan-Altman, Shiri; Levkovich, Inbar; Tavori, Guy",Palliat Support Care,497,16

Since then, efforts have been gathered to describe its clinical course and to determine preventive measures and treatment strategies. Adults older than 65 years of age are more susceptible to serious clinical symptoms and present higher mortality rates. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a major receptor for some coronavirus infection, including SARS-COV-2, but is also a crucial determinant in anti-inflammation processes during the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) functioning - converting angiotensin II to angiotensin 1-7. The decline in ACE2 expression that occurs with aging has been associated to the higher morbidity and mortality rates in older adults. These observations highlight the importance of investigating the association between COVID-19 and age-related neurodegenerative disorders, i.e., Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. A possible option to reduce the risk of COVID-19 is vitamin D supplementation, due to its anti-inflammatory and immune-system-modulating effects. It has also been suggested that vitamin D supplementation plays a role in slowing progression of Parkinson and Alzheimer. The present study is a literature review of articles published on the theme COVID-19, Parkinson and Alzheimer's diseases, and the role played by vitamin D.

A trend of lower lymphocyte count was observed in the pregnant women group PURPOSE: Laboratory abnormalities, which characterize SARS-CoV-2 infection have been identified, nevertheless, data concerning laboratory characteristics of pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 are limited. The aim of this study is to evaluate the laboratory characteristics of pregnant compared to non-pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of all pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 who were examined at the obstetric emergency room in a tertiary medical center between March and April 2020. Patients were compared with non-pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 matched by age, who were examined at the general emergency room during the study period. All patients were confirmed for SARS-CoV-2 on admission. Clinical characteristics and laboratory results were compared between the groups. RESULTS: Study group included 11 pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2, who were compared to 25 non-pregnant controls. Respiratory complaints were the most frequent reason for emergency room visit, and were reported in 54.5% and 80.0% of the pregnant and control groups, respectively (p = 0.12). White blood cells, hemoglobin, platelets, and liver enzymes counts were within the normal range in both groups. Lyphocytopenia was observed in 45.5% and 32% of the pregnant and control groups, respectively (p = 0.44). The relative lymphocyte count to WBC was significantly reduced in the pregnant group compared to the controls [13.6% (4.5-19.3) vs. 26.5% (15.7-29.9); p = 0.003]. C-reactive protein [20(5-41) vs. 14 (2-52) mg/dL; p = 0.81] levels were elevated in both groups but without significant difference between them. CONCLUSION: Laboratory characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection did not differ between pregnant and non-pregnant women, although a trend of lower lymphocyte count was observed in the pregnant women group.","Mohr-Sasson, Aya; Chayo, Jennifer; Bart, Yossi; Meyer, Raanan; Sivan, Eyal; Mazaki-Tovi, Shali; Yinon, Yoav",Arch Gynecol Obstet,497,20

Before the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, video conferencing was used by a small fraction of medical specialties. However, since the start of the pandemic, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the largest private health insurance companies have relaxed regulations to allow the majority of specialties to use video conferencing in lieu of in-person visits. Most importantly, video conferencing minimizes patient and physician exposure in situations such as these, and decreases risk in the immunocompromised population. Video conferencing, which has been shown to be just as safe and efficacious in treating patients, offers the ability to follow up with physicians while saving travel time and travel-related expenses. This in turn correlates with increased patient satisfaction. Video conferencing also allows physicians to expand their reach to patients in rural areas seeking advanced professional advice. Incorporating video conferencing into existing practices will make for a more efficient practice, improve patient satisfaction, and decrease cost to patients and the health care system.","Saad, Noah H; AlQattan, Husain T; Ochoa, Oscar; Chrysopoulo, Minas",Plast Reconstr Surg,497,29

Here we model the molecular and functional effects of TNF-&#945; in cardiomyocytes (CMs) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC). We found that treatment of hiPSC-CMs with TNF-&#945; increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and caspase 3/7 activity and caused cell death and apoptosis. TNF-&#945; treatment also resulted in dysregulation of cardiomyocyte function with respect to the increased abnormal calcium handling, calcium wave propagation between cells and excitation-contraction coupling. We also uncovered significant changes in gene expression and protein localization caused by TNF-&#945; treatment. Notably, TNF-&#945; treatment altered the expression of ion channels, dysregulated cadherins, and affected the localization of gap-junction protein connexin-43. In addition, TNF-&#945; treatment up-regulated IL-32 (a human specific cytokine, not present in rodents and an inducer of TNF-&#945;) and IL-34 and down-regulated glutamate receptors and cardiomyocyte contractile proteins.

A small proportion of patients infected with COVID-19 go on to develop pneumonia. We speculated that COVID-19 may be likely to result in psychological disorders such as anxiety and depression. In this study, we conducted an investigation of anxiety and depression in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Sixty-five COVID-19 patients were randomly enrolled into this study. Anxiety and depression among participants were measured through the completion of anonymous Chinese-language Zung self-rating anxiety scale and self-rating depression scale questionnaires. Data were analyzed using independent samples t-tests, Mann-Whitney U-tests, and &#967;2 tests. RESULTS: The questionnaire results showed that 26.15% and 41.54% of participants suffered from anxiety and depression, respectively, although there was no significantly statistical difference between the proportions of COVID-19 patients with anxiety and depression. Statistically significant differences in employment status, partial pressure of oxygen, and corticosteroid application existed between moderate- and severe COVID-19 patients (P<0.05). In particular, the partial pressure of oxygen was significantly lower in severe COVID-19 patients than in their moderate counter parts (71.31±23.54 vs. 101.06±34.43, U=156, P=0.006). Total lymphocytes was lower in severe group than in moderate group [1.659±0.643 vs. 0.745 (0.645, 0.928), U=109, P=0.000].

Advanced age appears to be the most important risk factor. The receptor for advanced glycation end-product (RAGE) pathway is considered to play important roles in the physiological aging and pathogenesis of lung diseases. This study aims to investigate the possible relationship between COVID-19 and RAGE pathway. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 23 asymptomatic patients and 35 patients with lung involvement who were diagnosed with COVID-19 as well as 22 healthy volunteers. Lung involvement was determined using computed-tomography. Serum soluble-RAGE (sRAGE) levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: The sRAGE levels were significantly higher in the asymptomatic group than in the control group. Age, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, and ferritin levels were higher and the sRAGE level was lower in the patients with lung involvement than in the asymptomatic patients. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, patients with high sRAGE levels were younger and had asymptomatic COVID-19. Patients with low sRAGE levels were elderly patients with lung involvement, which indicates that the RAGE pathway plays an important role in the aggravation of COVID-19.","Yalcin Kehribar, Demet; Cihangiroglu, Mustafa; Sehmen, Emine; Avci, Bahattin; Capraz, Aylin; Yildirim Bilgin, Ayse; Gunaydin, Caner; Ozgen, Metin",Biomarkers,497,16

In the context of hospitalization, the pandemic is expected to have a strong influence on affective reactions and preventive behaviors. Research is needed to develop evidence-driven strategies for coping with the challenges of the pandemic. Therefore, this survey study investigates the effects that personality traits, risk-taking behaviors, and anxiety have on medical service-related affective reactions and anticipated behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify key factors that are associated with individuals' concerns about hygiene in hospitals and the postponement of surgeries. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, web-based survey of 929 residents in Germany (women: 792/929, 85.3%; age: mean 35.2 years, SD 12.9 years). Hypotheses were tested by conducting a saturated path analysis. RESULTS: We found that anxiety had a direct effect on people's concerns about safety (ß=-.12, 95% CI -.20 to -.05) and hygiene in hospitals (ß=.16, 95% CI .08 to .23). Risk-taking behaviors and personality traits were not associated with concerns about safety and hygiene in hospitals or anticipated behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that distinct interventions and information campaigns are not necessary for individuals with different personality traits or different levels of risk-taking behavior. However, we recommend that health care workers should carefully address anxiety when interacting with patients.","Ostermann, Thomas; Gampe, Julia; Röer, Jan Philipp; Radtke, Theda",J Med Internet Res,497,24

We also identified potential new NANDA-I nursing diagnoses, NOC outcomes, and NIC interventions for future development related to nurses' role during a pandemic. METHODS: Using a consensus process, seven nurse experts created the linkages for individuals during the COVID 19 pandemic using the following steps: (a) creating an initial list of potential nursing diagnoses, (b) selecting and categorizing outcomes that aligned with all components of each nursing diagnosis selected, and (c) identifying relevant nursing interventions. FINDINGS: A total of 16 NANDA-I nursing diagnoses were identified as the foundation for the linkage work, organized in two dimensions, physiological and psychosocial. A total of 171 different NOC outcomes were identified to guide care based on the nursing diagnoses and 96 NIC interventions were identified as suggested interventions. A total of 13 proposed concepts were identified for potential future development across the three classifications. CONCLUSIONS: The linkages of nursing diagnoses, outcomes, and interventions developed in this article provide a guide to enhance nursing practice and determine the effectiveness of nurses' contribution to patient outcomes for individuals at risk for or infected by COVID-19. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: NANDA-I, NOC, and NIC linkages identified in this paper are an important example of the value of using standardized nursing terminologies to guide and document nursing care. When included in electronic health record databases and used widely, the data generated from the care plans can be used to create new knowledge about how to better improve outcomes for patients with COVID-19.","Swanson, Elizabeth; Mantovani, Vanessa Monteiro; Wagner, Cheryl; Moorhead, Sue; Lopez, Karen Dunn; Macieira, Tamara Gonçalves Rezende; Abe, Noriko",Int J Nurs Knowl,497,20

RA conduit fraction percent (RA cF%) was measured as percentage of total diastolic RA area change prior to the electrical p wave. Clinical worsening was analyzed with a predefined composite adverse event outcome. RESULTS: Longitudinal subjects (median age 13.3â¯yr) had RA cF% 61% (IQR 32-68%) at baseline and 60% (IQR 35-73%) at 1-year (NS). 11 subjects had a qualifying event during median 21-month follow-up.

Methods: Forty HCWs with COVID-19 were included in this study and 30 enrolled for imaging assessment. Disease was divided into four stages based on time from onset: stage 1 (1-6 days), stage 2 (7-13 days), stage 3 (14-22 days), and stage 4 (> 22 days). Clinical wand imaging data were analyzed retrospectively. Results: The cohort included 33 female and 7 male cases, with a median age of 40 years. Six had underlying comorbidities. More than half of the cases were nurses (22, 55%). Each stage included 39, 37, 34 and 32 CTs, respectively. Bilateral lesions, multifocal lesions and lesions with GGO pattern occurred in both lower lobes at all stages. The crazy-paving pattern (20, 54%), air bronchogram (13, 35%), and pleural effusion (2, 5%) were the most common CT features in stage 2.

The lockdown has led to colossal economic loss to India; however, it has come as a respite to the environment. Utilizing the air quality index (AQI) data recorded during this adverse time, the present study is undertaken to assess the impact of lockdown on the air quality of Ankleshwar and Vapi, Gujarat, India. The AQI data obtained from the Central Pollution Control Board was assessed for four lockdown phases. We compared air quality data for the unlock phase with a coinciding period in 2019 to determine the changes in pollutant concentrations during the lockdown, analyzing daily AQI data for six pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, CO, NO2, O3, and SO2). A meta-analysis of continuous data was performed to determine the mean and standard deviation of each lockdown phase, and their differences were computed in percentage in comparison to 2019; along with the linear correlation analysis and linear regression analysis to determine the relationship among the air pollutants and their trend for the lockdown days. The results revealed different patterns of gradual to a rapid reduction in most of the pollutant concentrations (PM10, PM2.5, CO, SO2), and an increment in ozone concentration was observed due to a drastic reduction in NO2 by 80.18%. Later, increases in other pollutants were also observed as the restrictions were eased during phase-4 and unlock 1. The comparison between the two cities found that factors like distance from the Arabian coast and different industrial setups played a vital role in different emission trends.","Nigam, Ritwik; Pandya, Kanvi; Luis, Alvarinho J; Sengupta, Raja; Kotha, Mahender",Sci Rep,497,14

In this article, we draw from three illustrative international cases, originating from the USA, the UK and Italy, to explore the ways in which right-wing populism influences health policy: the election of President Trump in the United States (and subsequent healthcare reforms), the United Kingdom's vote to withdraw from the European Union (Brexit), and how this has played out in the context of the UK National Health Service, and the rise of a politically aligned anti-vaccination movement in Italy. Drawing on the work of the influential socio-political theorist Ernesto Laclau, we interpret populism as a performative political act, predicated on drawing logics of equivalence (and difference) between different actors. We use this theoretical framing to explore the ways in which the recent upsurge in right-wing populism creates a specific set of barriers and challenges for access to healthcare and the health of populations.","Speed, Ewen; Mannion, Russell",Sociol. health illn,497,4

Clinical, radiological and laboratory data from patients who underwent lung resection from December 2019 to March 2020 were retrospectively collected until June 2020. Univariable Cox regression models were estimated to evaluate potential prognostic factors for developing COVID-19 and to investigate postoperative mortality among patients who developed symptomatic COVID-19 infection. We examined data from 107 patients. (74 lobectomies, 32 wedge/segmentectomies and 1 pneumonectomy). Twelve patients developed COVID-19 (Group 1), whereas 95 patients were not infected (Group 2). In Group 1, 6 patients (50%) died from complications related to infection; in Group 2, one patient (1%) died because of non-COVID-19-related causes. Median days from surgery to first symptoms, CT confirmation, clinical confirmation and PCR positivity was 48.1, 54.3, 55.1, and 55.2 respectively. At univariable analysis, DLCO/VA% (Pâ¯=â¯0.008), duration of the surgery (Pâ¯=â¯0.009), smoking history (pack/year) (P < 0.001), BMI (P< 0.001) and number of segments resected (Pâ¯=â¯0.010) were associated with COVID-19 onset.

Patients who undergo lung resection and then develop symptomatic COVID-19 infection are at higher risk of developing severe respiratory complications and postoperative death. Insidious symptoms' onset may lead to a delay in diagnosis. We suggest two mitigating strategies: (1) Improve symptoms surveillance and isolation during recovery period, (2) Be aware of a potential greater risk of developing symptomatic COVID-19 and death correlated with elevated CCI, BMI, smoking history, DLCO/VA%, number of resected segments and duration of surgery.","Scarci, Marco; Raveglia, Federico; Bortolotti, Luigi; Benvenuti, Mauro; Merlo, Luca; Petrella, Lea; Cardillo, Giuseppe; Rocco, Gaetano",Semin. thorac. cardiovasc. surg,497,24

We are intrinsically intellectual and social beings knitted with adaptive cognitive architectures. As Foot (2014) succinctly sums it up: ""humans act collectively, learn by doing, and communicate in and via their actions"" and they ""... make, employ, and adapt tools of all kinds to learn and communicate"" and ""community is central to the process of making and interpreting meaning-and thus to all forms of learning, communicating, and acting"" (p.3). Education remains pivotal in the transmission of social values including language, knowledge, science, technology, and an avalanche of others. Indeed, Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) have been significant to the advancement of social cultures transcending every epoch to contemporary times. As Jasanoff (2004) poignantly observed, ""the ways in which we know and represent the world (both nature and society) are inseparable from the ways in which we choose to live in it. [...] Scientific knowledge [..] both embeds and is embedded in social practices, identities, norms, conventions, discourses, instruments, and institutions"" (p.2-3). In essence, science remains both a tacit and an explicit cultural activity through which human beings explore their own world, discover nature, create knowledge and technology towards their progress and existence. This has been possible through the interaction and applications of artifacts, tools, and technologies within the purviews of their environments. The applications of technologies are found across almost every luster of organizational learning especially teacher education, STEM, architecture, manufacturing, and a flurry of others. Thus, human evolution and development are inexplicably linked with education either formally or informally. The 21st century has however seen a surge in the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and digital technologies in education. The proliferation of artificial intelligence and associated technologies are creating new overtures of digital multiculturalism with distinct worldviews of significance to education. For example, learners are demonstrating digital literacy skills and are knowledgeable about AI technologies across every specter of their lives (Bennett et al., 2008). It is also opening new artesian well-springs of educational opportunities and pedagogical applications. This includes mapping new methodological pathways, content creation and curriculum design, career preparations and indeed a seemingly new paradigm shift in teaching STEM.There is growing scholarly evidence about the use and diffusion of these technologies in K-12 and higher education (Bonk & Graham, 2012;Hew & Brush, 2007;Langer, 2018;Mishra & Koehler, 2006). Some of these include the Sphero robots, Micro Bit, Jill Watson, BrickPi3 Classroom kit, Engino STEM Mechanic, Lego Education WeDo Core Set and Spike. Both educators and learners are using these in STEM programs as well as other education related activities. Just as human activities and interactions with artifacts and tools shaped and redefined the scientific-technological feat of previous generations, so the contemporary digital technological era seems to be on a similar trajectory. However, there is sparsity of empirical scholarship on the pedagogical prospects and effectiveness of artificial intelligence in STEM classrooms. Also, it should be noted that scholarship on how AI impacts pedagogical content knowledge of STEM educators and how learners perceive these technologies are just emerging. In addition, the recent COVID-19 pandemic (Ghandhi et al., 2020;Rasmussen et al., 2020) has unexpectedly created a renewed synergy towards the applications of digital technologies in teaching STEM.

I first explore theoretical discussions about biopolitics, necropolitics, and the long historical relationship between capitalism and death. I then point to an emerging literature on ""economies of death"" and apply that to the opioid epidemic in the United States as an illustrative case of a ""necroeconomy"". I reflect upon parallels between the opioid epidemic and the COVID-19 pandemic, turning to current debate in the United States about reopening the economy versus the associated public health risks of further lives being lost. The rhetoric of these debates reflects widespread economic values that prioritize some lives over others, making explicit who is ultimately ""killable"" in the quest to return to a flourishing and efficient economy.","Darian-Smith, E.",State Crime,497,5

This study was carried out to measure and characterise the ""care dependency"" phenomenon in this phase and to obtain deeper knowledge about this phenomenon. BACKGROUND: The end of a human life is often characterised by a physical decline, often implying that a high amount of care is needed. Non-malignant diseases can develop unpredictably; therefore, it is difficult to detect the onset of the EoL phase. DESIGN: Data were collected in a cross-sectional multicentre study, using the Austrian Nursing Quality Measurement 2.0. METHODS: Descriptive and multivariate statistical methods were used. Care dependency was measured with the Care Dependency Scale (CDS). The study follows the STROBE guideline. RESULTS: Ten per cent (n = 389) of the sample (N = 3589) were allocated to ""a pathway for management of patients at the end of life."" The patients and residents in the EoL phase are significantly older and more often diagnosed with dementia, and circulatory system and musculoskeletal system diseases. Of these patients, 60% were care dependent completely or to a great extent. Dementia and age represent main influencing factors that affect the degree of care dependency at the end of life. CONCLUSION: Our results show that the ""typical"" EoL patient or resident is female, old and affected by dementia and/or circulatory system diseases. Dementia and age were identified as main factors that contribute to very high care dependency. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The measurement of care dependency may support the identification of special care needs in the EoL phase. Gaining deeper knowledge about the care dependency phenomenon can also help healthcare staff better understand the needs of patients with non-malignant conditions in their last phase of life.","Schüttengruber, Gerhilde; Halfens, Ruud J G; Lohrmann, Christa",J. clin. nurs,497,5

The mean age was 59 ± 14.8 years, the POP group consisted of 42 women while the UI group included 54 women. Most participants (83% of POP and 81% of UI cases) stated that their female pelvic floor dysfunction had remained equally relevant or had become even more significant during the lockdown. Associated symptoms and psychological strain also maintained their relevance during the lockdown (UI: p = 0.229; POP: p = 0.234).

We analysed its impact on patients with female pelvic floor dysfunction during the 6 weeks of lockdown in Austria. A cross-sectional study was conducted: All 99 women who presented at the urogynaecologic outpatient clinic of the Medical University of Vienna with pelvic organ prolapse (POP) or urinary incontinence (UI) from December 2019 up to the lockdown in March 2020 were included and contacted. 97% of these women (96 participants) agreed to participate in the survey conducted to asses pelvic floor related quality of life (QoL) through telephone- interrogation. The mean age was 59 ± 14.8 years, the POP group consisted of 42 women while the UI group included 54 women. Most participants (83% of POP and 81% of UI cases) stated that their female pelvic floor dysfunction had remained equally relevant or had become even more significant during the lockdown. Associated symptoms and psychological strain also maintained their relevance during the lockdown (UI: p = 0.229; POP: p = 0.234).

Among the others, a UAV can be employed as a relay in a""store-carry and forward""fashion by uploading data from ground sensors and meters and, then, downloading it to a central unit. However, both the uploading and downloading phases can be prone to potential threats and attacks. As a legacy from traditional wireless networks, the jamming attack is still one of the major and serious threats to UAV-aided communications, especially when the jammer is mobile, too, e.g., it is mounted on an UAV or inside a terrestrial vehicle. In this paper, we investigate anti-jamming communications in UAV-aided WSNs operating over doubly-selective channels. In such a scenario, the signals transmitted by the legitimate transmitters (sensors and meters in the uploading phase or the UAV in the downloading phase) and the malicious mobile jammer undergo both time dispersion due to multipath propagation effects and frequency dispersion caused by Doppler shifts. To suppress the jamming signal, we propose a blind physical-layer technique that jointly exploits amplitudes, phases, time delays, and Doppler shifts differences between the two superimposed signals. Such parameters are estimated from data through the use of algorithms exploiting the almost-cyclostationarity properties of the received signal. Simulation results corroborate the antijamming capabilities of the proposed method, for different mobility scenario of the jammer.","Darsena, Donatella; Gelli, Giacinto; Iudice, Ivan; Verde, Francesco",,497,25

This study aimed to determine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on MIS in urology practice at national level. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 234 urologists in Turkey participated in an online survey between August 22 and September 23, 2020. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Descriptive statistical analyses were conducted to determine the participants' demographic characteristics and responses to multiple-choice questions. RESULTS: While 54% of urologists stated that they were concerned about the possibility that the patients planned to undergo MIS were carrying COVID-19 or false-negative for the virus, 51% considered that open surgery was safer than MIS in this regard. The pandemic led to a difference in the preferences of 40% of the urologists in relation to open or MIS methods, and during the pandemic, 39% of the urologists always directed their patients to open surgery. It was determined that during the pandemic, there was a statistical decrease in the intensity and weekly application of MIS methods among all surgical procedures compared to the pre-pandemic (P < .001 and P < .001, respectively). MIS was preferred for oncological operations by 97.3% of the urologists during the pandemic, with the most performed operation being radical nephrectomy (90.7%). Among oncological operations, radical prostatectomy was most frequently postponed. To prevent virus transmission during MIS, 44% of the urologists reported that they always used an additional evacuation system and 52% took additional precautions. There were a total of 27 healthcare workers who took part in MIS and tested positive for COVID-19 after the operation. CONCLUSIONS: Although the number of operations has decreased during the ongoing pandemic, MIS is a method that can be preferred due to its limited contamination and mortality in urology practice provided that safety measures are taken and guideline recommendations are followed.","Danacioglu, Yavuz Onur; Soytas, Mustafa; Polat, Salih; Ozdemir, Osman; Arikan, Ozgur; Yenice, Mustafa Gurkan; Atis, Ramazan Gokhan; Tasci, Ali Ihsan",Int J Clin Pract,497,1

In particular, SARS-CoV-2 is currently a major threat to public health worldwide. The spike (S) homotrimers bind to their receptors via the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which is a major target to block viral entry. In this study, we selected Alpha-coronavirus (HCoV-229E) and Beta-coronavirus (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) as models. Their RBDs exist two different conformational states (lying or standing) in the prefusion S-trimer structure. Then, the differences in the immune responses to RBDs from these coronaviruses were analyzed structurally and immunologically. Our results showed that more RBD-specific antibodies (antibody titers: 1.28×105; 2.75×105) were induced by the S-trimer with the RBD in the ""standing"" state (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) than the S-trimer with the RBD in the ""lying"" state (HCoV-229E, antibody titers: <500), and more S-trimer-specific antibodies were induced by the RBD in the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (antibody titers: 6.72×105; 5×105) than HCoV-229E (antibody titers:1.125×103). Besides, we found that the ability of the HCoV-229E RBD to induce neutralizing antibodies was lower than S-trimer, and the intact and stable S1 subunit was essential for producing efficient neutralizing antibodies against HCoV-229E. Importantly, our results reveal different vaccine strategies for coronaviruses, and S-trimer is better than RBD as a target for vaccine development in Alpha-coronavirus Our findings will provide important implications for future development of coronavirus vaccines.Importance Outbreak of coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV-2, poses a serious threat to global public health. Development of vaccines to prevent the coronaviruses that can infect humans has always been a top priority. Coronavirus spike (S) protein is considered as a major target for vaccine development. Currently, structural studies have shown that Alpha-coronavirus (HCoV-229E) and Beta-coronavirus (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) RBDs are in ""lying"" and ""standing"" states in the prefusion S-trimer structure. Here, we evaluated the ability of S-trimer and RBD to induce neutralizing antibodies among these coronaviruses. Our results showed that the S-trimer and RBD are both candidates for subunit vaccines in Beta-coronavirus (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) with a RBD ""standing"" state. However, for Alpha-coronavirus (HCoV-229E) with a RBD ""lying"" state, the S-trimer may be more suitable for subunit vaccines than the RBD.

The suspected interspecies transmission of SARSr-CoVs from bats to humans has caused two severe CoV pandemics, the SARS pandemic in 2003 and the recent COVID-19 pandemic. The receptor utilization of SARSr-CoV plays the key role in determining the host range and the interspecies transmission ability of the virus. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as their receptor. Previous studies showed that WIV1 strain, the first living coronavirus isolated from bat using ACE2 as its receptor, is the prototype of SARS-CoV. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV and WIV1 is responsible for ACE2 binding and medicates the viral entry. Comparing to SARS-CoV, WIV1 has three distinct amino acid residues (442, 472, and 487) in its RBD. This study aimed at exploring whether these three residues could alter the receptor utilization of SARSr-CoVs. We replaced the three residues in SARS-CoV (BJ01 strain) S with their counterparts in WIV1 S, and then evaluated the change of their utilization of bat, civet, and human ACE2s using a lentivirus-based pseudovirus infection system. To further validate the S-ACE2 interactions, the binding affinity between the RBDs of these S proteins and the three ACE2s were verified by flow cytometry. The results showed that the single amino acid substitution Y442S in the RBD of BJ01 S enhanced its utilization of bat ACE2 and its binding affinity to bat ACE2. On the contrary, the reverse substitution in WIV1 S (S442Y) significantly attenuated the pseudovirus utilization of bat, civet and human ACE2s for cell entry, and reduced its binding affinity with the three ACE2s. These results suggest that the S442 is critical for WIV1 adapting to bats as its natural hosts. These findings will enhance our understanding of host adaptations and cross-species infections of coronaviruses, contributing to the prediction and prevention of coronavirus epidemics.","Li, Jin-Yan; Wang, Qiong; Liao, Ce-Heng; Qiu, Ye; Ge, Xing-Yi",Virus Res,497,24

The final model of the logistic regression analysis revealed that O2 requirement (RR = 7.27 [1.50-19.31]), monocytes below 0.2G/L (RR = 2.88 [1.67-3.19]), fibrinogen levels (RR = 1.45 [1.17-1.82] per g/L increase), prothrombin fragments 1+2 higher than 290 pM (RR = 2.39 [1.20-3.30]), and thrombin peak (RR = 1.28 [1.03-1.59] per 50 nM increase) were associated with an increased risk of clinical worsening. A fibrinogen level threshold of 5.5 g/L, a thrombin peak measurement threshold of 99 pM, and O2 requirement associated with clinical outcome in more than 80% of our cohort. In conclusion, we identified fibrinogen and thrombin peak at admission as coagulation biomarkers associated with an increased risk of ICU admission or death.

Actually, participants (Study 1 N = 80, Study 2 N = 78) were given the same non-mealworm containing food in all conditions. Disgust was measured using: tactile sensitivity, food intake, liking and desire to eat. Results of Study 1 showed that a sustainability passage (sustainability advantages of entomophagy), but not a delicacy passage (oro-sensory qualities of insects), was effective in reducing disgust. In Study 2, contrary to prediction, a passage describing the sustainability and nutritional advantages entomophagy failed to reduce disgust - falafel intake, liking and desire to eat were decreased. However, a passage which described how mealworm flour is produced, did significantly reduce disgust. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that written passages can alter the disgust response, notably resulting in a maintenance of food intake. Interventions that increase the perception of familiarity of a novel food, but not logic-based arguments, may be a key driver of the amelioration of disgust. These results also support the suggestion that altering the ideational component of disgust can result in changes of distaste perception.","Gumussoy, Maya; Macmillan, Chloe; Bryant, Stephanie; Hunt, David F; Rogers, Peter J",Appetite,497,1

Risk factors for a severe disease course for young COVID-19 patients and possible non-linear influences remain unknown. Data were analyzed from COVID-19 patients with clinical outcome in a single hospital in Wuhan, China, collected retrospectively from Jan 24th to Mar 27th. Clinical, demographic, treatment and laboratory data were collected from patients' medical records. Uni- and multivariable analysis using logistic regression and random forest, with the latter allowing the study of non-linear influences, were performed to investigate the clinical characteristics of a severe disease course. A total of 762 young patients (median age 47 years, interquartile range [IQR] 38–55, range 18–60; 55.9% female) were included, as well as 714 elderly patients as a comparison group. Among the young patients, 362 (47.5%) had a severe/critical disease course and the mean age was statistically significantly higher in the severe subgroup than in the mild subgroup (59.3 vs. 56.0, Student's t-test: p < 0.001). The uni- and multivariable analysis suggested that several covariates such as elevated levels of serum amyloid A (SAA), C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and decreased lymphocyte counts influence disease severity independently of age. Elevated levels of complement C3 (odds ratio [OR] 15.6, 95% CI 2.41–122.3; p = 0.039) are particularly associated with the risk of developing severe COVID-19 specifically in young patients, whereas no such influence seems to exist for elderly patients. Additional analysis suggests that the influence of complement C3 in young patients is independent of age, gender, and comorbidities. Variable importance values and partial dependence plots obtained using random forests delivered additional insights, in particular indicating non-linear influences of risk factors on disease severity. This study identified increased levels of complement C3 as a unique risk factor for adverse outcomes specific to young COVID-19 patients.","Cheng, Weiting; Hornung, Roman; Xu, Kai; Yang, Cai hong; Li, Jian",Sci Rep,497,1

Our study is focused on the role of the host extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in the infectious process of New World alphaviruses. Infection of human cells by Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) results in the activation of the ERK-signaling cascade. Inhibition of ERK1/2 by the small molecule inhibitor Ag-126 results in inhibition of viral multiplication. Ag-126-mediated inhibition of VEEV was due to potential effects on early and late stages of the infectious process. While expression of viral proteins was down-regulated in Ag-126 treated cells, we did not observe any influence of Ag-126 on the nuclear distribution of capsid. Finally, Ag-126 exerted a broad-spectrum inhibitory effect on New World alphavirus multiplication, thus indicating that the host kinase, ERK, is a broad-spectrum candidate for development of novel therapeutics against New World alphaviruses.","Voss, Kelsey; Amaya, Moushimi; Mueller, Claudius; Roberts, Brian; Kehn-Hall, Kylene; Bailey, Charles; Petricoin, Emanuel; Narayanan, Aarthi",Virology,497,11

However, these approaches are known to leave polymer residues on the graphene surface, which are difficult to remove completely. In addition, graphene growth and transfer processes can introduce defects into the graphene layer. Both defects and resist contamination can affect the homogeneity of graphene-based PoC sensors, leading to inconsistent device performance and unreliable sensing. Sensor reliability is also affected by the harsh chemical environments used for chemical functionalisation of graphene PoC sensors, which can degrade parts of the sensor device. Therefore, a reliable, wafer-scale method of passivation, which isolates the graphene from the rest of the device, protecting the less robust device features from any aggressive chemicals, must be devised. This work covers the application of molecular vapour deposition technology to create a dielectric passivation film that protects graphene-based biosensing devices from harsh chemicals. We utilise a previously reported “healing effect” of Al(2)O(3) on graphene to reduce photoresist residue from the graphene surface and reduce the prevalence of graphene defects to improve graphene device homogeneity. The improvement in device consistency allows for more reliable, homogeneous graphene devices, that can be fabricated at wafer-scale for sensing and biosensing applications.","Ali, Muhammad Munem; Mitchell, Jacob John; Burwell, Gregory; Rejnhard, Klaudia; Jenkins, Cerys Anne; Daghigh Ahmadi, Ehsaneh; Sharma, Sanjiv; Guy, Owen James",Nanomaterials (Basel),497,20

Physical therapy rehabilitation (PTR) focuses on the re-institution of function in bodily strength and movement. Covid-19 has created a challenge in one-on-one PTR sessions due to social distancing, which requires the minimization of all non-essential physical contact. Most outpatient services in PTR have had to be staggered and minimized to increase adherence to social distancing requirements and flatten the pandemic's curve. Telemedicine is applicable in PTR in several ways, including guided therapy sessions, and remote monitoring of patient progress through videoconferencing. Telemedicine allows patients to access PTR from the comfort of their homes, which minimizes travel costs and general strain on the body. Although it has been encumbered by various challenges, telemedicine could revolutionize the delivery of PTR while also increasing access to essential healthcare services. OBJECTIVE Purpose: Covering the main aspects of telemedicine usability in physical therapy rehabilitation, that encourage using of the telemedicine in physical therapy in the world regions not covered by, especially the Middle East. METHODS Method: A systematic search in libgen.is, jmir.org, wiley.com, sagepub.com, and scholar.google.com. was performed using the search terms: Telemedicine; asynchronous telemedicine; synchronous telemedicine; Covid-19; rehabilitation medicine; physical therapy rehabilitation; videoconferencing; Medicaid programs; telehealth; and HIPAA. Papers published up to Oct. 22nd, 2020, in English, were included. RESULTS Telemedicine is cost-effective for physical therapy Rehabilitation particularly in pandemic like COVID19, also it's time and human resources saving especially with hands-off skills rehabilitation. CONCLUSIONS Telemedicine is a revolutionary aspect of medicine that has seen an unexpected uptake following the Covid-19 pandemic. While people formerly preferred live sessions for PTR, the convenience of telemedicine is increasingly emerging. The various advantages, including reduced cost implications, reduced waiting time, and reduction of non-essential travel to obtain therapy have increased the preference for telemedicine. [9] The WHO recognizes the importance of Telemedicine, and conducted a regional and global survey to analyze its viability. At the onset of global lockdown due to Covid-19, the APTA expressed the need for physiotherapists to utilize telemedicine as an alternative for efficient PTR delivery within the bounds of social recommendations for curve-flattening. Telemedicine in PTR has various advantages including cost reduction, the convenience of access, reduction of long waiting lists among others for the patient. [10] PTR can also be availed to areas that are too remote to have a full-fledged PTR center. Through the utilization of nurse aides and other social support systems, therapists can effectively conduct therapy sessions through videoconferencing. Laws governing the adoption and use of telemedicine for PTR include the HIPAA and other DPL, which regulate the extent to which therapists can collect, use, and store data collected during online therapy sessions. Therapists need to obtain verifiable consent from the patient before commencement. CLINICALTRIAL","Mahmoud, Islam Ahmad Muhammad",JMIR rehabilitation and assistive technologies,497,23

The biosynthesis of S and M was analyzed in the presence of tunicamycin and monensin. The effect of treatment with endoglycosidases H and F and glycopeptidase F on the precursors and mature forms of S and M were also examined. Species 175K and 29K were characterized as high mannose forms of S and M, respectively, and species 220K and 30–36K as complex type glycosylated forms of these two proteins. M was present mainly as a 29K species in mature virions whereas the 175K form of S was not detected, thus implying that the two proteins undergo Golgi modifications at a far different efficiency. Anti-S and -M monoclonal antibodies were examined for their reactivity towards polypeptide species either treated with endo H or produced in the presence of tunicamycin. It was found that (i) among the four major antigenic sites previously defined (Delmas et al., 1986), only site C (amino acids 363 to 371) was notably expressed by the unglycosylated S polypeptide 155K, whereas the three other sites were dependent upon core-glycosylation, (ii) three of the four anti-M mAbs tested did not recognize the unglycosylated M polypeptide 26K. These data led us to conclude that co-translational, but not terminal glycosylation is an essential requirement for both acquisition and maintenance of the antigenicity of TGEV glycoproteins.","Delmas, Bernard; Laude, Hubert",Virus Research,497,1

PATIENTS: The study participants consisted of 7 crewmembers of the passenger cruise-liner, Diamond Princess, who were admitted to our hospital after becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 aboard the ship. METHODS: The data on patient background and biochemical test results were obtained from the patients' medical records. All patients had a chest X-ray, and a throat swab and sputum samples were sent for culture on admission. RESULTS: The median age of the 7 patients, of whom 4 were male and 3 were female, was 39 years (range: 23-47 years). On admission, none of them had fever, but 4 (57%) had a cough. None of them showed any signs of organ damage on laboratory testing. Chest X-ray showed pneumonia in one individual, which resolved spontaneously, while the other 6 had normal chest X-ray findings. Culture of throat swabs and sputum samples revealed that 4 patients (57%) had bacterial upper respiratory infections (Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus). The period from a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test to negative conversion ranged from 5 to 13 days, with a median of 8 days. CONCLUSION: Healthy young adults without risk factors who acquire SARS-CoV-2 infection may have an asymptomatic infection or may experience mild COVID-19. In addition to obesity, an older age, underlying illness, and being overweight can lead to a risk of exacerbation; thus, hospital management for such individuals may be desirable. Culturing respiratory samples may be useful for diagnosing secondary bacterial pneumonia.","Hoshiyama, Takayuki; Wada, Tatsuhiko; Nihonyanagi, Shin; Kameda, Ryo; Yamaoka-Tojo, Minako; Fukuda, Michinari; Ako, Jyunya; Yamaoka, Kunihiro; Takayama, Yoko",Intern Med,497,1

Despite mild manifestations in most children, multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19 is well described in older children with cardiac manifestations. However, MIS-C-related cardiac manifestations are not as well described in younger children. METHODS: The study is a retrospective analysis of MIS-C patients under the age of 5 years admitted between May and November 2020 to a single centre. Included cases fulfilled the case definition of MIS-C according to Royal College of Pediatrics and Child Health criteria with laboratory, electrocardiogram, or echocardiographic evidence of cardiac disease. Collected data included patients’ demographics, laboratory results, echocardiographic findings, management, and outcomes. RESULTS: Out of 16 MIS-C cases under 5 years of age, 10 (62.5%) had cardiac manifestations with a median age of 12 months, 9 (90%) were previously healthy. Cardiac manifestations included coronary arterial aneurysms or ectasia in five (50%) cases, two (20%) with isolated myopericarditis, coronary ectasia with myocarditis in two (20%), and supraventricular tachycardia in one (10%). Intravenous immunoglobulins were given in all cases with coronary involvement or myocarditis. The median duration of hospitalisation was 7 (6–14) days; two (20%) cases with cardiac disease were mechanically ventilated and mortality in MIS-C cases below 5 years was 12.5%. Normalisation of systolic function occurred in half of the affected cases within 1 week and reached 100% by 30 days of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: MIS-C associated with SARS-CoV-2 has a high possibility of serious associated cardiac manifestations in children under the age of 5 years with mortality and/or long-term morbidities such as coronary aneurysms even in previously healthy children.","Rakha, Shaimaa; Sobh, Ali; Hager, Amira H.; Hafez, Mona; Alsawah, Gehan A.; Abuelkheir, Mohamed Magdi; Zeid, Mayada Sabry; Nahas, Mohamed; Elmarsafawy, Hala",Cardiology in the young,497,9

Previous studies have determined that Caveolin-1 controlled hyperresponsiveness to mechanical stimuli through Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) activation in keloids. However, the molecular mechanism of Runx2 regulating the pathological progression of keloids has not been elucidated. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis revealed that most of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including Runx2, were significantly enriched in the biological processes ‘Positive regulation of cell proliferation’, in the cellular components ‘Extracellular matrix’, in the molecular functions ‘Extracellular matrix structural constituents’ and in the KEGG ‘PI3K-Akt signaling pathway’. The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression levels of the Runx2 in human keloid tissues and primary human keloid fibroblasts (HKFs), and to determine the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in the fibrotic roles of Runx2 in keloid formation. Runx2 expression levels were analyzed in patient keloid tissues and HKFs using western blotting, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and immunofluorescence microscopy. Primary HKFs were transfected with a small interfering RNA (si) specifically targeting Runx2 (si-Runx2). Subsequently, Cell Counting Kit-8, wound healing and Transwell assays, flow cytometry, RT-qPCR and western blotting were applied to evaluate the proliferation, migration, apoptosis, ECM deposition and PI3K/AKT signaling pathway of HKFs, respectively. In addition, western blotting was also used to determine the expression levels of phosphorylated AKT and PI3K in HKFs. The results revealed that Runx2 expression levels were upregulated in keloid tissues and primary HKFs compared with the normal skin tissues and human normal fibroblasts. Following the transfection with si-Runx2, the proliferative and migratory abilities of HKFs were significantly reduced and the apoptotic rate was increased. The expression levels of type I, type III collagen, fibronectin, and α-smooth muscle actin were downregulated in si-Runx2-transfected cells, which was hypothesized to occur through following the downregulation of the phosphorylation levels of PI3K and AKT. In conclusion, the findings of the present study indicated that Runx2 silencing in HKFs might significantly inhibit the cell proliferation, migration and the expression levels of ECM-related proteins, and promote apoptosis via suppressing the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Thus, Runx2 siRNA treatment may reverse the pathological phenotype of keloids through the inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling in patients.","Lv, Wenchang; Wu, Min; Ren, Yuping; Luo, Xiao; Hu, Weijie; Zhang, Qi; Wu, Yiping",Mol Med Rep,497,30

Most cases (93%) have occurred in states west of the Mississippi River. We present a case of a young male who presented with Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. CASE PRESENTATION: 28 year old male from rural Texas presented with 1 week of intractable nausea and vomiting. He initially presented to an outside ER where he was found to be hypoxic requiring supplemental oxygen and worsening respiratory status and was transferred to our hospital for higher level of care. Initial workup with CT angiogram of chest revealed bilateral infiltrates and bilateral pleural effusions. Patient was initially started on empiric antibiotics and placed on non-invasive ventilation. Influenza and Repeated COVID-19 tests were negative. Patient reported that he lives in rural area and recently had exposure to a dead mouse in one of his house traps. Hantavirus IgG and IgM antibodies were sent which came back positive after patient had been discharged. Patient did well with supportive therapy of gentle diuresis and non-invasive ventilation and was discharged home after 5 days. DISCUSSION: The clinical syndrome of Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) was first recognized in 1993. Although rare, it is frequently fatal, with a case fatality rate of 36%. HPS is an acute febrile illness with a prodrome consisting of fever, chills, myalgia, headache, and gastrointestinal symptoms. One or more of the following clinical features must be present:• Bilateral diffuse interstitial edema• Clinical diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)• Radiographic evidence of noncardiogenic pulmonary edemaLaboratory criteria for diagnosis include detection of hantavirus-specific immunoglobulin M or rising titers of hantavirus-specific immunoglobulin G. CONCLUSIONS: Patients infected with Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome do better if they are recognized early and treated in Intensive care unit. There is no specific treatment or vaccine available at this point. Supplemental oxygen and intubation and mechanical ventilation for severe respiratory failure remains the standard of care.

Understanding learners’ perceptions of virtual classrooms can help inform current and future best practices for online, synchronous, graduate medical education. METHODS: We surveyed emergency medicine and internal medicine residency programs at a large urban academic medical center about their perceptions of synchronous online residency conferences. RESULTS: Residents reported a preference for in-class interactions with peers (85%) and lecturers (80%), with 62% reporting decreased levels of engagement with lecturers during online conferences. Residents reported performing nearly twice as many non-conference-related activities (eg, email, exercise) during online conferences vs in-class conferences. Residents felt that the following methods improved engagement during online conferences: lecturers answering chat questions; small group sessions; and gamification of lectures. CONCLUSION: Synchronous online residency conferences were associated with decreased engagement and attention by learners.

Current methods for surveillance of diseases with epidemic potential do not include monitoring the adherence to preventive measures. Furthermore, modern data collection methods depend often on technologies (e.g., cameras or drones) that are hardly available in low-income countries. Simpler solutions could be just as effective. METHODS: A dashboard was used over a whole week to monitor preventive measures in Bukavu (DRC) by mid-May 2020. It was designed to collect from street passers-by information on the adherence to barrier measures, the level of awareness of these measures, the opinion on their usefulness, and the health status of people in the households. RESULTS: Creating a dashboard and collecting the necessary data proved feasible. The use of barrier measures was very limited and that of masks practically nil despite repeated recommendations from the health authorities. The end of each day was the worst moment due to clearly insufficient distancing. Barrier measures were significantly more used in areas where they were best known and most acknowledged. At the time of the study, there were few sick people and only rare severe cases were attributed to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Creating COVID-19 situation dashboards in limited-resource metropoles is feasible. They give real-time access to data that help fight the epidemic. The findings of this pilot study call for a rapid community awareness actions to back national media-based prevention campaigns.","Wimba, Patient Mijiriro; Bazeboso, Jacques-Aimé; Katchunga, Philippe Bianga; Tshilolo, Léon; Longo-Mbenza, Benjamin; Rabilloud, Muriel; Vanhems, Philippe; Iwaz, Jean; Étard, Jean-François; Écochard, René",Trop Med Health,497,1

These include antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anticonvulsants as well as anticoagulants, statins, and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS)-inhibitors for somatic comorbid conditions. All these agents may reduce the hyperinflammatory response to SARS/CoV-2 or the related negative cardio-cerebrovascular outcomes. METHODS In a retrospective longitudinal, multi-center inpatient study, we sought to explore the influence of psychiatric medications on COVID-19, comprising the period from diagnosing SARS/CoV-2-infection via PCR (nasopharyngeal swab) up to the next 21 days. Ninety-six psychiatric inpatients (mean age [SD] 65.5 (20.1), 54% females) were included. The primary outcome was the COVID-19-duration. Secondary outcomes included symptom severity and the presence of residual symptoms. RESULTS COVID-19-related symptoms emerged in 60 (62.5%) patients, lasting 6.5 days on average. Six (6.3%) 56-95 years old patients died from or with COVID-19. COVID-19-duration and residual symptom-presence (n=22, 18%) were not significantly related to any substance. Respiratory and neuro-psychiatric symptom-load was significantly and negatively related to prescription of antidepressants and anticoagulants, respectively. Fatigue was negatively and positively related to RAAS-inhibitors and proton-pump-inhibitors, respectively. These significant relationships disappeared with p-value adjustment owed to multiple testing. The mean total psychiatric burden was not worsened across the study. DISCUSSION None of the tested medications was significantly associated with the COVID-19-duration and -severity up to the end of post-diagnosing week 3. However, there were a few biologically plausible and promising relationships with antidepressants, anticoagulants, and RAAS-inhibitors before p-value adjustment. These should encourage larger and prospective studies to re-evaluate the influence of somatic and psychiatric routine medications on COVID-19-related health outcomes.","Bonnet, Udo; Claus, BenediktBernd; Schaefer, Martin; Kuhn, Jens; Nyhuis, Peter; Scherbaum, Norbert; Brüne, Martin; Wakili, Velat; Juckel, Georg",Pharmacopsychiatry,497,24

Only recently was it known for its coding gene and for its role implicated in cholesterol homeostasis. Here, we have investigated the transcriptional control of S2R by the Bromo/ExtraTerminal epigenetic reader family (BETs, including BRD2, 3, and 4) upon cholesterol perturbation. Cholesterol deprivation was induced in ARPE19 cells using a blocker of lysosomal cholesterol export. This condition up-regulated S2R mRNA and protein, and also SREBP2 but not SREBP1, both transcription factors key to cholesterol/fatty acid metabolism. Silencing BRD2 but not BRD3 or BRD4 (though widely deemed a master regulator) averted S2R up-regulation that was induced by cholesterol deprivation. Silencing SREBP2 but not SREBP1 diminished S2R expression. Furthermore, endogenous BRD2 co-immunoprecipitated with the transcription-active N-terminal half of SREBP2, and chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR signified co-occupancy of BRD2, H3K27ac (histone acetylation), and SREBP2Nterm at the S2R gene promoter. In summary, this study reveals a previously unrecognized BRD2/SREBP2 cooperative regulation of S2R transcription, thus shedding new light on signaling in response to cholesterol deprivation.","Shen, Hongtao; Li, Jing; Xie, Xiujie; Yang, Huan; Zhang, Mengxue; Wang, Bowen; Kent, K Craig; Plutzky, Jorge; Guo, Lian-Wang",Life Sci Alliance,497,11

However, there is scarce evidence on how to successfully implement quarantine orders. We investigated a community quarantine for an entire village in Germany (Neustadt am Rennsteig, March 2020) with the aim of better understanding the successful implementation of quarantine measures. METHODS: This cross-sectional survey was conducted in Neustadt am Rennsteig six weeks after the end of a 14-day mandatory community quarantine. The sample size consisted of 562 adults (64% of the community), and the response rate was 295 adults, or 52% (33% of the community). FINDINGS: National television was reported as the most important channel of information. Contact with local authorities was very limited, and partners or spouses played a more important role in sharing information. Generally, the self-reported information level was judged to be good (211/289 [73.0%]). The majority of participants (212/289 [73.4%]) approved of the quarantine, and the reported compliance was 217/289 (75.1%). A self-reported higher level of concern as well as a higher level of information correlated positively with both a greater acceptance of quarantine and self-reported compliant behaviour. INTERPRETATION: The community quarantine presented a rare opportunity to investigate a public health intervention for an entire community. In order to improve the implementation of public health interventions, public health risk communication activities should be intensified to increase both the information level (potentially leading to better compliance with community quarantine) and the communication level (to facilitate rapport and trust between public health authorities and their communities).","Scholz, Juliane; Wetzker, Wibke; Licht, Annika; Heintzmann, Rainer; Scherag, André; Weis, Sebastian; Pletz, Mathias; Betsch, Cornelia; Bauer, Michael; Dickmann, Petra",PLoS One,497,16

These occur predominantly in the poor who suffer catastrophic costs during diagnosis and treatment. The National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme has ambitious goals of 80% reduction of incidence of TB, 90% reduction in mortality due to TB by 2025 and 0% occurrence of catastrophic costs to households affected by TB by 2020. The Covid-19 pandemic and the resulting disruption to TB services are expected to worsen the situation. There are gaps in case finding at the peripheral level and access to care at the higher level for patients with TB. An estimated 32% patients with active TB do not access diagnostic services, while catastrophic costs associated with hospitalization are a barrier to access for seriously ill patients. Deaths due to TB in India occur largely at home and not in medical facilities, and are preventable with appropriate inpatient care. The Ayushman Bharat scheme with its Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs) and coverage for inpatient care under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY) can facilitate, the achievement of the goals of TB elimination. The HWCs provide an opportunity to close the case-finding gap as first point of contact by enabling sputum transport services to the designated microscopy centres. This will facilitate case detection, reduce diagnostic delays, and decrease community transmission and the incidence of TB.

Recently, there has been a renewed interest in this crop because of its panoply of cannabinoids, terpenes, and other phenolic compounds. Specifically, hemp contains terpenophenolic compounds such as cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabigerol (CBG), which act on cannabinoid receptors and positively regulate various human metabolic, immunological, and physiological functions. CBD and CBG have an effect on the cytokine metabolism, which has led to the examination of cannabinoids on the treatment of viral diseases, including COVID-19.

Nevertheless, there are few reports on hemp metabolic engineering despite obvious impact on scientific and industrial sectors. In this article, recent status and current perspectives on hemp metabolic engineering are reviewed. Three distinct approaches to expedite phytochemical yield are discussed. Special emphasis has been placed on transgenic and transient gene delivery systems, which are critical for successful metabolic engineering of hemp.

This service provides an advanced, timely, personalized, and flexible responses to the demand of the PTS, especially of commuters. Obviously, it could have an impact on public transport (PT) service. For instance, CB services influence the customers' variety-seeking behavior, which results in changes of customer options in different periods. Therefore, customers could be divided into different groups of preference. In this paper, we construct a two-period Hotelling game model by variety-seeking behavior and service level. The results show that, in the first stage, the departure frequency of CB and PT is influenced by variety-seeking behavior and service level. In the second stage, departure frequency is influenced by service level only. Next, although the departure frequency of bus impacts the changes of passenger ratios in different stages, service level appreciably impacts passenger number. From customer surplus and social welfare, we find that adjustment of service level can increase social welfare, which means that CB and PT will reach an optimum effect.

Results: We collected 1,996 eligible questionnaires between April 26th and May 1st, 2020. One-fifth (20%) of respondents knew someone diagnosed with COVID-19, but few had tested positive themselves (0.6%). Negative impacts of pandemic conditions were evidenced in several areas, including concerns about healthcare (e.g. sufficient equipment, 52%), pandemic stress (45%), and worsening social (49%) and mental/emotional (39%) health. Most respondents (88%) felt they had good to excellent knowledge of virus transmission, and predominantly accessed (74%) and trusted (60%) Canadian news television, newspapers/magazines, or non-government news websites for COVID-19 information. We found high compliance with distancing measures (80% either self-isolating or always physical distancing). We identified regional differences in perceptions, knowledge, and behaviors related to COVID-19. Discussion: We found that knowledge about COVID-19 is largely acquired through domestic news sources, which may explain high self-reported compliance with prevention measures. The results highlight the broader impact of a pandemic on the general public's overall health and wellbeing, outside of personal infection. The study findings should be used to inform public health communications during COVID-19 and future pandemics.","Parsons Leigh, J.; Fiest, K.; Brundin-Mather, R.; Plonikoff, K.; Soo, A.; Sypes, E.

Outbreak management is essential to reduce the impact in both the institution and the surrounding community. Through the use of an online survey, we aimed to measure the perceptions and responses of staff and students towards pandemic (H1N1) 2009 at a major university in Sydney, Australia. METHODS: The survey was available online from 29 June to 30 September 2009. The sample included academic staff, general staff and students of the University. RESULTS: A total of 2882 surveys were completed. Nearly all respondents (99.6%, 2870/2882) were aware of the Australian pandemic situation and 64.2% (1851/2882) reported either ""no anxiety"" or ""disinterest."" Asian-born respondents were significantly (p < 0.001) more likely to believe that the pandemic was serious compared to respondents from other regions. 75.9% (2188/2882) of respondents had not made any lifestyle changes as a result of the pandemic. Most respondents had not adopted any specific behaviour change, and only 20.8% (600/2882) had adopted the simplest health behaviour, i.e. hand hygiene. Adoption of a specific behaviour change was linked to anxiety and Asian origin. Students were more likely to attend the university if unwell compared with staff members. Positive responses from students strongly indicate the potential for expanding online teaching and learning resources for continuing education in disaster settings. Willingness to receive the pandemic vaccine was associated with seasonal influenza vaccination uptake over the previous 3 years. CONCLUSIONS: Responses to a pandemic are subject to change in its pre-, early and mid-outbreak stages. Lessons for these institutions in preparation for a second wave and future disease outbreaks include the need to promote positive public health behaviours amongst young people and students.","Van, Debbie; McLaws, Mary-Louise; Crimmins, Jacinta; MacIntyre, C Raina; Seale, Holly",BMC Public Health,497,1

A body of evidence has emerged to support the use of a non-arsenical adulticide treatment protocol, using moxidectin and doxycycline to kill adult heartworms over a prolonged period. While a three-dose protocol using the arsenical drug melarsomine is currently the safest and most effective treatment for heartworm infection, this drug is not available in some countries and is inaccessible for many owners and animal shelters. Moxidectin-doxycycline (moxi-doxy) provides a viable alternative to no treatment at all, in cases where arsenical treatment is not possible. Based on current evidence, the most effective non-arsenical treatment regimen is doxycycline 10 mg/kg PO q 12 or 24 h for 28 days, combined with topical moxidectin at label dose. Moxidectin is repeated monthly until no antigen detected (NAD) status is confirmed. Sustained release injectable moxidectin, in combination with doxycycline, may provide an alternative in remote regions or in settings where significant compliance or accessibility concerns exist, but more studies are needed. In moxi-doxy protocols, doxycycline should be repeated annually until NAD. This review summarizes the safety and efficacy of moxi-doxy, addresses controversies surrounding this treatment approach, and provides detailed recommendations for treatment regimens and post-treatment testing.","Jacobson, Linda S.; DiGangi, Brian A.",Front Vet Sci,497,29

This rapid review summarises the existing research on the determinants of behaviours that aim to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The review focuses on the body of research (excluding research conducted with health care workers) that was produced in the context of viruses other than SARS CoV-2 that cause severe respiratory illness and are transmitted in a similar way. A total of 58 published peer-reviewed studies included in the review were identified through searches of Medline, Embase, PsychInfo and CINAHL. Most were conducted in the context of the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic in 2009. Most studies examined the determinants of wearing a face covering, handwashing and social or physical distancing. The findings suggest that public health messages to encourage preventive behaviours should emphasise the potential seriousness of COVID-19 to elicit appropriate concern, strengthen perceptions of risk or threat from COVID-19, enhance self-efficacy about preventive behaviours, and improve knowledge about SARS-CoV-2, how it is transmitted, and how preventive behaviours can reduce the risk of transmission.","Hanratty, Jennifer; Bradley, Declan T.; Miller, Sarah J.; Dempster, Martin",Acta Psychol (Amst),497,16

Objectives: A preliminary investigation to explore the views of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, with and without experience of psychosis symptoms, and carers on the resumption of clinical research and adaptations to trials in light of COVID-19. Methods: An anonymous self-administered online survey was completed by 30 PD patients and six family members/carers via the Parkinson's UK Research Support Network to explore current perceptions on taking part in PD research and how a planned clinical trial for psychosis in PD may be adapted so participants feel safe. Results: Ninety-one percent of respondents were enthusiastic about the continuation of non-COVID-19 related research as long as certain safety measures were in place. Ninety-four percent stated that they would be happy to complete assessments virtually. However, they noted that care should be taken to ensure that this does not exclude participants, particularly those with more advanced PD who may require assistance using portable electronic devices. Regular and supportive communication from the research team was also seen as important for maintaining the psychological well-being of participants while taking part in the trial. Conclusions: In the era of COVID-19 pandemic, standard approaches will have to be modified and rapid adoption of virtual assessments will be critical for the continuation of clinical research. It is important that alongside the traditional methods, new tools are developed, and older ones validated for virtual assessments, to allow safe and comprehensive assessments vital for ongoing research in people with Parkinson's.","McGoohan, Katie; Amjad, Anneesa; Ratcliffe, Natasha; Bhattacharyya, Sagnik; Granville, Gillian; Sullivan, Matthew; Gosden, Lesley; Aarsland, Dag; Chaudhuri, K.

Results showed that all four types of media (official media, commercial media, social media, and overseas media) cause vicarious traumatization to their audiences to different degrees. It was also found that the impact of media exposure on anxiety was mediated by media vicarious traumatization: there were full mediation effects for commercial media exposure and overseas media exposure, while there were indirect-only mediation effects for official media exposure and social media exposure. Audiences staying in cities with a relatively severe pandemic were more susceptible to the vicarious traumatization caused by commercial media compared to those staying in Hubei.

This allows to sample the data with the number of measurements proportional to the sparsity level and information content of the data. Moreover, the particular design of the measurement matrix causes the aggregated data to be encrypted and its security be guaranteed. Simulation results show that compared to its counterpart schemes, the proposed sensing model not only provides security but also reduces the average energy consumption of the sensor nodes and the average packet delivery delay.

The test is practical when the sample size is small, or the distributional assumption under a parametric test does not satisfy. One of the limitations of the Sign test is the exact form of the data, and the existing methodology of the test does not cover the interval-valued data. The interval-valued data often comes from the fuzzy logic where the experiment’s information is not sure and possesses some kind of vagueness, uncertainty or indeterminacy. This research proposed a modified version of the Sign test by considering the indeterminate state and the exact form of the data—the newly proposed sign test methodology is designed for both one-sample and two-sample hypothesis testing problems. The performance of the proposed modified versions of the Sign test is evaluated through two real-life data examples comprised of covid-19 reproduction rate and covid-positive daily occupancy in ICU in Pakistan. The findings of the study suggested that our proposed methodologies are suitable in nonparametric decision-making problems with an interval–valued data.

Thus, immunomodulatory medicines such as steroids, including methylprednisolone, have been proposed to treat patients with severe HFMD in China, because it is postulated that inflammatory cytokines play a role in the development of severe complications. This study is to further investigate the inflammatory response in the relatively mild HFMD patients, and whether steroid treatment has a beneficial effect on the suppression of inflammation in HFMD patients. METHOD: We measured the levels of 50 kinds of chemokines, cytokines, growth factors and soluble receptors in serum samples from control patients without HFMD and the HFMD patients with or without prior treatment of intravenous methylprednisolone. RESULTS: Our present study found that even relatively mild HFMD patients without central nervous system (CNS) complications had elevated serum levels of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-3, IL-6, IL-12p40, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, which suggested systemic inflammation. In contrast, these patients also have decreased levels of other serum biomarkers, including IL-1Ra, IL-8, IL-16, soluble ICAM-1, CXCL-1, and CCL27. The dysregulation of cytokine and chemokine expression may be involved in CNS complications and unbalanced circulating leukocytes in HFMD patients. Surprisingly, patients treated with methylprednisolone had no difference in the expression levels of HFMD-associated biomarkers instead had slightly increased levels of IL-17A, which was not associated with the occurrence of HFMD.

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: During the COVID-19 pandemic, national guidelines have recommended patients with operable stage IA NSCLC to consider delaying surgery by at least 3 months or, alternatively, to undergo SBRT without delay. It is unknown which strategy is associated with better short- and long-term outcomes. METHODS: Multivariable Cox proportional hazards modeling and propensity score-matched analysis was used to compare the overall survival of patients with stage IA NSCLC in the National Cancer Data Base from 2004 to 2015 who underwent “early” SBRT (0–30 days after diagnosis) versus that of patients who underwent “delayed” wedge resection (90–120 days after diagnosis). RESULTS: During the study period, 570 (55%) patients underwent early SBRT and 475 (45%) underwent delayed wedge resection. In multivariable analysis, delayed resection was associated with improved survival [adjusted hazard ratio 0.61; (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.50–0.76)]. Propensity-score matching was used to create 2 groups of 279 patients each who received early SBRT or delayed resection that were well-matched with regard to baseline characteristics. The 5-year survival associated with delayed resection was 53% (95% CI: 45%–61%) which was better than the 5-year survival associated with early SBRT (31% [95% CI: 24%–37%]). CONCLUSION: In this national analysis, for patients with stage IA NSCLC, extended delay of surgery was associated with improved survival when compared to early treatment with SBRT.","Mayne, Nicholas R.; Lin, Belle K.; Darling, Alice J.; Raman, Vignesh; Patel, Deven C.; Liou, Douglas Z.; D’Amico, Thomas A.; Yang, Chi-Fu Jeffrey",Ann Surg,497,21

Children with the SARS-CoV-2 infection can have neurological signs and symptoms of disease more frequently than previously thought, revealing the involvement of the central nervous system, the peripheral nervous system, or both. Aim of this manuscript is to highlight the neurologic complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 among pediatric patients with COVID-19, suggesting when to monitor carefully neurologic development. MAIN FINDINGS: Children with a severe chronic underlying disease, infants and toddlers and those who develop the so-called multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) are those with the highest incidence of neurological complications. Fortunately, in most of the cases, neurological manifestations, mainly represented by headache and anosmia, are mild and transient and do not significantly complicate the COVID-19 course. However, in some cases, very severe clinical problems associated with relevant alterations of neuroimaging, electroencephalography, nerve conduction studies and electromyography findings can develop. Generally, almost all the children with COVID-19 and neurological manifestations till now described have made a complete recovery, although in some cases this has occurred after several weeks of treatment. Moreover, COVID-19 infection during pregnancy has been found associated with an increased risk of obstetric complications that can lead to neurological acute and long-term manifestations in neonates. CONCLUSIONS: Based on data showing the neurologic impact of COVID-19 in pediatric age, we suggest monitoring neurological development a few months after healing in pediatric patients who have presented MIS-C, seizures or other neurological manifestations and in children of pregnant women with COVID-19 in order to detect overt and subtle deficits.","Principi, Nicola; Esposito, Susanna",Ital J Pediatr,497,1

Étude bicentrique comparative : réduction de la durée d’hospitalisation",15.9977665,-1.5206515,2020-09-30,"OBJECTIVES: To systematically review qualitative studies reporting the use of virtual consultations within an orthopaedic rehabilitation setting and to understand how its use changes the work required of patients. METHODS: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis statement, we conducted a systematic review of papers to answer the research question ‘How do changes in the work of being a patient when using communication technology influence patient preferences?’ Electronic databases were searched for studies meeting the inclusion criteria in April 2020. RESULTS: The search strategy identified 2057 research articles from the database search. A review of titles and abstracts using the inclusion criteria yielded 21 articles for full-text review. Nine studies were included in the final analysis. Six studies explored real-time video conferencing and three explored telephone consultations. The use of communication technology changes the work required of patients. Such changes will impact on expectations for care, resources required of patients, the environment of receiving care and patient–clinician interactions. This adjustment of the work required of patients who access orthopaedic rehabilitation using communication technology will impact on their experience of receiving care. It is proposed that changes in the work of being a patient will influence preferences for or against the use of communication technology consultations for orthopaedic rehabilitation. CONCLUSION: We found that the use of communication technology changes the work of being a patient. The change in work required of patients can be both burdensome (it makes it harder for patients to access their care) and beneficial (it makes it easier for patients to access their care). This change will likely to influence preferences. Keeping the concept of patient work at the heart of pathway redesign is likely to be a key consideration to ensure successful implementation.

However, analytical methods to support NGS platforms are not as uniformly available. Pathosphere (found at Pathosphere.org) is a cloud - based open - sourced community tool that allows for communication, collaboration and sharing of NGS analytical tools and data amongst scientists working in academia, industry and government. The architecture allows for users to upload data and run available bioinformatics pipelines without the need for onsite processing hardware or technical support. RESULTS: The pathogen detection capabilities hosted on Pathosphere were tested by analyzing pathogen-containing samples sequenced by NGS with both spiked human samples as well as human and zoonotic host backgrounds. Pathosphere analytical pipelines developed by Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (ECBC) identified spiked pathogens within a common sample analyzed by 454, Ion Torrent, and Illumina sequencing platforms. ECBC pipelines also correctly identified pathogens in human samples containing arenavirus in addition to animal samples containing flavivirus and coronavirus. These analytical methods were limited in the detection of sequences with limited homology to previous annotations within NCBI databases, such as parvovirus. Utilizing the pipeline-hosting adaptability of Pathosphere, the analytical suite was supplemented by analytical pipelines designed by the United States Army Medical Research Insititute of Infectious Diseases and Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (USAMRIID-WRAIR). These pipelines were implemented and detected parvovirus sequence in the sample that the ECBC iterative analysis previously failed to identify. CONCLUSIONS: By accurately detecting pathogens in a variety of samples, this work demonstrates the utility of Pathosphere and provides a platform for utilizing, modifying and creating pipelines for a variety of NGS technologies developed to detect pathogens in complex sample backgrounds. These results serve as an exhibition for the existing pipelines and web-based interface of Pathosphere as well as the plug-in adaptability that allows for integration of newer NGS analytical software as it becomes available.

With mounting reports of delirium, systemic inflammation, and evidence of neurotropism, a statement on cognitive impairment among COVID-19 cases is needed. A substantial literature has demonstrated that inflammation can severely disrupt brain function, suggesting an immune response, a cytokine storm, as a possible cause of neurocognitive impairments. In this light, the aim of the present study was to summarize the available knowledge of the impact of COVID-19 on cognition (i.e., herein, we broadly define cognition reflecting the reporting on this topic in the literature) during the acute and recovery phases of the disease, in hospitalized patients and outpatients with confirmed COVID-19 status. A systematic review of the literature identified six studies which document the prevalence of cognitive impairment, and one which quantifies deficits after recovery. Pooling the samples of the included studies (total sample n = 644) at three standards of quality produced conservative estimates of cognitive impairment ranging from 43.0 to 66.8% prevalence in hospitalized COVID-19 patients only, as no studies which report on outpatients met criteria for inclusion in the main synthesis. The most common impairment reported was delirium and frequent reports of elevated inflammatory markers suggest etiology. Other studies have demonstrated that the disease involves marked increases in IL-6, TNFα, and IL-1β; cytokines known to have a profound impact on working memory and attention. Impairment of these cognitive functions is a characteristic aspect of delirium, which suggests these cytokines as key mediators in the etiology of COVID-19 induced cognitive impairments. Researchers are encouraged to assay inflammatory markers to determine the potential role of inflammation in mediating the disturbance of cognitive function in individuals affected by COVID-19.","Alnefeesi, Yazen; Siegel, Ashley; Lui, Leanna M.

These alerts warned on the risks of an exponential increase in emergence of potentially pandemic zoonotic infectious diseases related to disruptive ecological niches in different regions of the globe, such as H1N1 Influenza, SARS, MERS, Zika, avian flu, swine flu, and Ebola, and also on the risks of a future and more lethal Disease X. We examine this global public health failure in anticipating and responding to the pandemic, stressing the urgent need for an innovative global pandemic preparedness system in the current transition from linear economy to a circular economy. Evidence provided here indicates that this novel preventive-based and resource-saving preparedness system could contribute to reverse the detrimental impacts of the pandemic on global economy and increase its resilience. Individual protection, contact tracing, and lockdown have proved to be just partially effective to respond to the spillover of viral zoonosis into the human population, and for most of these pathogens, vaccines are not yet available. As for COVID-19 vaccines, in spite of the extraordinary investments and unprecedented advances in innovative vaccines in few months, most of these products are expected to be available to more vulnerable developing countries’ populations only by mid-2022. Furthermore, even when these vaccines are available, constraints such as low efficacy, waning immunity, new concerning COVID-19 variants, adverse events, and vaccine hesitancy might possibly restrict their public health impact and could contribute to aggravate the pandemic scenario. Considering these constraints and the severe global economic and social crises resulting from the lack of adequate preparedness and delayed effective response to COVID-19 and possibly to a future Disease X, we propose a pro-active global eco-social pandemic preparedness system. This novel system, based on One Health paradigm and on artificial intelligence and machine learning, is expected to incorporate “spillover” foresight and management into global preparedness and timely response. Designed to mitigate damage from outbreaks and minimize human morbidity and mortality, this approach to pandemic foresight and preparedness will be key to prevent a global disaster.","Possas, Cristina; Marques, Ernesto T.

AKI risk levels were assigned to upcoming AKI events and tested through a prospective analysis between June and August 2020. The trained model gave an AUROC of 0.881 (95% CI 0.878–0.883), when assessing predictions per blood test for AKI occurrences within 30 days. Assigning risk levels and testing the model through prospective validation from the 1st June to the 31st August identified 73.8% of patients with an AKI event before at least one AKI occurrence, 61.2% of AKI occurrences.

METHODS: To compare Relative Search Volume (RSV) among different twelve preselected urologic keywords we chose “United States” as country and “01/01/2009–31/12/2018” as time range on Google Trends (GT). We defined “ureteroscopy” as a reference and compared RSV against it for each term. RSV was adjusted and normalized in a scale 0–100. Trend presence was evaluated by Mann–Kendall Test and magnitude by Sen’s Slope Estimator (SS). Weather influence on RSV was also investigated by comparison of the ten hottest versus ten coldest states. Pearson correlation analysis was performed between number of Pubmed publications and RSV for each term over time. RESULTS: We found an upward tendency (p < 0.01) for most terms. Higher temporal trends were seen for “kidney stone” (SS = 0.36), “kidney pain” (SS = 0.39) and “tamsulosin” (SS = 0.21). Technical treatment terms had little search volumes and no increasing trend. States with hotter weather showed higher mean RSV for “kidney stone” than colder ones. There was little correlation between GT and Pubmed for most terms, with the exception of “kidney stone” (R = 0.89; p < 0.01), “URS” (R = 0.81; p < 0.01), and “laser lithotripsy” (R = 0.74; p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: There was a significant increase in online search for medical information related to stone disease. Citizens tend to look for generic terms related to symptoms or the disease itself.

Nurses have been facing a tremendous amount of fear and anxiety during the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. General self-efficacy is considered one of the most influential factors that can modify the impact of anxiety on nurses' mental health. In this study, we aimed to determine the predictors of self-efficacy and anxiety among nurses during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey involving 368 nurses working in a tertiary care hospital. The General Self-Efficacy scale (GSE) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7) were used for assessing self-efficacy and anxiety. The chi-square test followed by bivariate and multivariable regression analyses was performed to identify the determinants of self-efficacy and anxiety. Results The mean age of the nurses was 28.91 years (SD=3.68), with a mean working experience in the nursing field of 5.32 years (SD=2.48). The mean self-efficacy and anxiety scores were 32.19 (SD=4.53) and 3.82 (SD=2.87), respectively. Multivariable analysis showed that higher age (>30 years, p=.003), professional education acquired through a diploma course instead of a graduate degree (p<.001), and lack of training on handling COVID-19 patients (p=.003) were significant determinants of higher anxiety among nurses. Similarly, higher economic status (p=.001), sufficient COVID-19 training (p=.049), having family members tested positive for COVID-19 (p=.012), professional experience (≤5 years, p<0.001), and quarantine period (≤14 days, p=.002) were revealed to be independent determinants of a higher sense of self-efficacy among nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion Receiving adequate levels of training on COVID-19 plays a vital role in improving self-efficacy and reducing anxiety among nurses during the ongoing pandemic. Managing anxiety, increasing self-efficacy, and ensuring more exposure to COVID-19-related training may improve nurses' mental health and prepare them for fighting pandemics in a much better and more efficient manner.","Dharra, Sanjana; Kumar, Rajesh",Cureus,497,1

To better understand the wide host range of these viruses, better knowledge on the molecular determinants of virus–host cell entry mechanisms in wildlife hosts is essential. We investigated Alphacoronavirus‐1 infection in carnivores using long‐term data on Serengeti spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) and molecular analyses guided by the tertiary structure of the viral spike (S) attachment protein's interface with the host receptor aminopeptidase N (APN). We sequenced the complete 3′‐end region of the genome of nine variants from wild African carnivores, plus the APN gene of 15 wild carnivore species. Our results revealed two outbreaks of Alphacoronavirus‐1 infection in spotted hyenas associated with genetically distinct canine coronavirus type II (CCoVII) variants. Within the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S gene the residues that directly bind to the APN receptor were conserved in all variants studied, even those infecting phylogenetically diverse host taxa. We identified a variable region within RBD located next to a region that directly interacts with the APN receptor. Two residues within this variable region were under positive selection in hyena variants, indicating that both sites were associated with adaptation of CCoVII to spotted hyena APN. Analysis of APN sequences revealed that most residues that interact with the S protein are conserved in wild carnivores, whereas some adjacent residues are highly variable. Of the variable residues, four that are critical for virus–host binding were under positive selection and may modulate the efficiency of virus attachment to carnivore APN.","Olarte‐Castillo, Ximena A.; dos Remédios, Joana F.; Heeger, Felix; Hofer, Heribert; Karl, Stephan; Greenwood, Alex D.; East, Marion L.",Mol Ecol,497,10

However, the utilization of this natural transfer process for disease treatment is so far limited by its unsatisfactory transfer efficiency and selectivity. Here, we demonstrate that iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) can augment the intercellular mitochondrial transfer from human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) selectively to diseased cells, owing to the enhanced formation of connexin 43–containing gap junctional channels triggered by ionized IONPs. In a mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis, the IONP-engineered hMSCs achieve a remarkable mitigation of fibrotic progression because of the promoted intercellular mitochondrial transfer, with no serious safety issues identified. The present study reports a potential method of using IONPs to enable hMSCs for efficient and safe transfer of mitochondria to diseased cells to restore mitochondrial bioenergetics.","Huang, Ting; Zhang, Tianyuan; Jiang, Xinchi; Li, Ai; Su, Yuanqin; Bian, Qiong; Wu, Honghui; Lin, Ruyi; Li, Ni; Cao, Hongcui; Ling, Daishun; Wang, Jinqiang; Tabata, Yasuhiko; Gu, Zhen; Gao, Jianqing",Science Advances,497,6

METHODS: This is a consecutive case series conducted at the Institute for Maternal and Child Health, Trieste, Italy. Paediatric patients who accessed the Institute for cardiologic and pneumological evaluation before the return‐to‐play competitive sports were recruited, according to the Italian Sports Medical Federation recommendations. Echocardiogram, electrocardiogram, treadmill ECG test and pulmonary function tests were performed. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty‐two patients (aged 8–17 years old, mean age 12.8 ± 2.5) were recruited. Among these, 127 children were considered for the final analysis (49.6% females). Out of 127, 84 (66.1%) had a mild symptomatic form of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, while 43 (33.9%) were asymptomatic. The main referred symptoms were fever (n = 37, 44%), asthenia (n = 14, 16.7%), rhinitis (n = 16, 19%), ageusia (n = 19, 22.6%), anosmia (n = 24, 28.6%), sore throat (n = 3, 3.6%), cough (n = 9, 10.7%), arthralgia‐myalgia (n = 11, 13.1%), headache (n = 23, 27.4%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (n = 7, 8.3%).

We study changes in all new registered diagnoses in ICD-10 groups during 2020 with respect to a 2019 baseline. We compare new diagnoses in 2019 and 2020 based on administrative records of the public primary health system in Central Catalonia, Spain, which cover over 400,000 patients and 3 million patient visits. We study the ratio of new diagnoses between 2019 and 2020 and find an average decline of 31.1% in new diagnoses, with substantial drops in April (61.1%), May (55.6%), and November (52%). Neoplasms experience the largest decline (49.7%), with heterogeneity in the magnitudes of the declines across different types of cancer diagnoses. While we find evidence of temporal variation in new diagnoses, reductions in diagnoses early in the year are not recouped by the year end. The observed decline in new diagnoses across all diagnosis groups suggest a large number of untreated and undetected cases across conditions. Our findings provide a year-end summary of the impact of the pandemic on healthcare activities and can help guide health authorities to design evidence-based plans to target under-diagnosed conditions in 2021.","Pifarré i Arolas, Héctor; Vidal-Alaball, Josep; Gil, Joan; López, Francesc; Nicodemo, Catia; Saez, Marc",Int J Environ Res Public Health,497,13

Most of SARS-CoV-2 carriers are assumed to exhibit no or mild non-specific symptoms. Thus, they may contribute to the rapid and mostly silent circulation of the virus among humans. Since SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples it has recently been proposed to monitor SARS-CoV-2 in wastewaters (WW) as a complementary tool to investigate virus circulation in human populations. In the present work we assumed that the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in wastewaters should correlate with the number of symptomatic or non-symptomatic carriers. To test this hypothesis, we performed a time-course quantitative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR in raw wastewater samples collected from several major wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) of the Parisian area. The study was conducted from March 5 to April 23 2020, therefore including the lockdown period in France (since March 17 2020). We confirmed that the increase of genome units in raw wastewaters accurately followed the increase of human COVID-19 cases observed at the regional level. Of note, the viral genomes could be detected before the beginning of the exponential growth of the epidemic. As importantly, a marked decrease in the quantities of genomes units was observed concomitantly with the reduction in the number of new COVID-19 cases which was an expected consequence of the lockdown. As a conclusion, this work suggests that a quantitative monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in wastewaters should bring important and additional information for an improved survey of SARS-CoV-2 circulation at the local or regional scale.","Wurtzer, Sebastien; Marechal, Vincent; Mouchel, Jean-Marie; Maday, Yvon; Teyssou, Remy; Richard, Elise; Almayrac, Jean Luc; Moulin, Laurent",,497,1

There are barriers to implementation that have not been researched. OBJECTIVE: This study examines whether and how ethnicity data can be collected in Irish general practices in a meaningful and acceptable way. METHODS: Qualitative case study data generation was informed by Normalization Process Theory (NPT) constructs about ‘sense’ making and ‘engagement’. It consisted of individual interviews and focus group discussions based on visual participatory techniques. There were 70 informants, including 62 general practitioner (GP) users of diverse ethnic backgrounds recruited through community organisations and eight GPs identified through an inter-agency steering group. Data were analysed according to principles of thematic analysis using NPT. RESULTS: The link between ethnicity and health was often considered relevant because GP users grasped connections with genetic (skin colour, lactose intolerance), geographic (prevalence of disease, early years exposure), behavioural (culture/food) and social determinant (housing) factors. The link was less clear with religion. There was some scepticism and questions about how the collection of data would benefit GP consultations and concerns regarding confidentiality and the actual uses of these data (e.g. risk of discrimination, social control). For GPs, the main theme discussed was relevance: what added value would it bring to their consultations and was it was their role to collect these data? Their biggest concern was about data protection issues in light of the European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The difficulty in explaining a complex concept such as ‘ethnicity’ in the limited time available in consultations was also worrying. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of an ethnicity identifier in Irish general practices will require a strong rationale that makes sense to GP users, and specific measures to ensure that its benefits outweigh any potential harm. This is in line with both our participants’ views and the EU GDPR.","Roura, Maria; LeMaster, Joseph W.; Hannigan, Ailish; Papyan, Anna; McCarthy, Sharon; Nurse, Diane; Villarroel, Nazmy; MacFarlane, Anne",PLoS One,497,26

In-house molecular diagnostic methods for this virus termed Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) allowed sensitive MERS-CoV RNA detection in patient samples. Fast diagnosis is important to manage human cases and trace possible contacts. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to improve the availability of existing nucleic acid amplification-based diagnostic methods for MERS-CoV infections by providing a real-time RT-PCR kit, including an internal control and two target regions recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). And to validate this kit (RealStar(®) MERS-CoV RT-PCR kit 1.0, Altona Diagnostics GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) using clinical samples of one MERS-CoV case from Munich and respiratory samples of patients with other respiratory diseases. STUDY DESIGN: An internal amplification control was included into the RT-PCR assays targeting the genomic region upstream of the Envelope gene (upE) and within open reading frame (ORF) 1A. Based on these assays, a ready-to-use real-time RT-PCR kit featuring both the upE and ORF1A assays was developed, validated and compared to the established in-house versions. RESULTS: The performance of both RT-PCR assays included in the kit is comparable to the in-house assays. They show high analytical sensitivity (upE: 5.3 copies/reaction; ORF1A: 9.3 copies/reaction), no cross-reactivity with other respiratory pathogens and detected MERS-CoV RNA in patient samples in almost the same manner as the in-house versions. CONCLUSION: The kit is a valuable tool for assisting in the rapid diagnosis, patient management and epidemiology of suspected MERS-CoV cases.","Corman, Victor Max; Ölschläger, Stephan; Wendtner, Clemens-Martin; Drexler, Jan Felix; Hess, Markus; Drosten, Christian",J Clin Virol,497,11

After analyzing the regulatory networks of differentially expressed messenger RNAs (mRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) between the different clinical stages, we found that humoral immunity and type I interferon response were significantly downregulated, while robust T-cell activation and differentiation at the whole transcriptome level constituted the main events that occurred during recovery from COVID-19. The formation of this T cell immune response might be driven by the activation of activating protein-1 (AP-1) related signaling pathway and was weakly affected by other clinical features. These findings uncovered the dynamic pattern of immune responses and indicated the key role of T cell immunity in the creation of immune protection against this disease.","Zheng, Hong-Yi; Xu, Min; Yang, Cui-Xian; Tian, Ren-Rong; Zhang, Mi; Li, Jian-Jian; Wang, Xi-Cheng; Ding, Zhao-Li; Li, Gui-Mei; Li, Xiao-Lu; He, Yu-Qi; Dong, Xing-Qi; Yao, Yong-Gang; Zheng, Yong-Tang",Signal Transduct Target Ther,497,1

Viral agents are prone to genetic variation and mutation, and can be manipulated or created in the laboratory. Unlike bacterial diseases, many of which are treatable with antimicrobials, there are fewer medical countermeasures to employ when dealing with viral infections.","Morse, S. A.; Meyer, R.

Having demonstrated potent antiviral activity against coronaviruses in preclinical studies, remdesivir emerged as a candidate drug for the treatment of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, during the current global pandemic. Phase III evaluation of remdesivir in the treatment of COVID-19 commenced in early 2020 and has thus far yielded promising results. In late May 2020, Taiwan conditionally approved the use of remdesivir in patients with severe COVID-19. This was followed by a rapid succession of conditional approvals in various countries/regions including the EU and Canada. Preceding these conditional approvals, an emergency use authorization for remdesivir had been granted in the USA (on 1 May 2020) and a special approval for emergency use was granted in Japan (on 7 May 2020). This article summarizes the milestones in the development of remdesivir leading to its first conditional approval for the treatment of COVID-19.","Lamb, Yvette N.",Drugs,497,1

We aimed to evaluate epidemiological characteristics, needs of resources, outcomes, and global burden of the disease. METHODS: Systematic review was performed searching PubMed from December 1, 2019, to March 25, 2020, for full-text observational studies that described epidemiological characteristics, following MOOSE protocol. Global data were collected from the JHU-Corona Virus Resource Center, WHO-COVID-2019 situation reports, KFF.org, and Worldometers.info until March 31, 2020. The prevalence percentages were calculated. The global data were plotted in excel to calculate case fatality rate (CFR), predicted CFR, COVID-19 specific mortality rate, and doubling time for cases and deaths. CFR was predicted using Pearson correlation, regression models, and coefficient of determination. RESULTS: From 21 studies of 2747 patients, 8.4% of patients died, 20.4% recovered, 15.4% were admitted to ICU and 14.9% required ventilation. COVID-19 was more prevalent in patients with hypertension (19.3%), smoking (11.3%), diabetes mellitus (10%), and cardiovascular diseases (7.4%). Common complications were pneumonia (82%), cardiac complications (26.4%), acute respiratory distress syndrome (15.7%), secondary infection (11.2%), and septic shock (4.3%). Though CFR and COVID-19 specific death rates are dynamic, they were consistently high for Italy, Spain, and Iran. Polynomial growth models were best fit for all countries for predicting CFR. Though many interventions have been implemented, stern measures like nationwide lockdown and school closure occurred after very high infection rates (>10cases per 100 000population) prevailed. Given the trend of government measures and decline of new cases in China and South Korea, most countries will reach the peak between April 1-20, if interventions are followed. CONCLUSIONS: A collective approach undertaken by a responsible government, wise strategy implementation and a receptive population may help contain the spread of COVID-19 outbreak. Close monitoring of predictive models of such indicators in the highly affected countries would help to evaluate the potential fatality if the second wave of pandemic occurs. The future studies should be focused on identifying accurate indicators to mitigate the effect of underestimation or overestimation of COVID-19 burden.","Patel, Urvish; Malik, Preeti; Mehta, Deep; Shah, Dhaivat; Kelkar, Raveena; Pinto, Candida; Suprun, Maria; Dhamoon, Mandip; Hennig, Nils; Sacks, Henry",Journal of global health,497,25

Like ACE, the human homologue ACE2 is also involved in blood pressure regulation and cleaves a range of substrates involved in different physiological processes. Importantly, it is the functional receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus (CoV)-2 responsible for the 2020, coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Understanding the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 is crucial for the design of therapies to combat this disease. This review provides a comparative analysis of methodologies and findings to describe how structural biology techniques like X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy have enabled remarkable discoveries into the structure–function relationship of ACE and ACE2. This, in turn, has enabled the development of ACE inhibitors for the treatment of cardiovascular disease and candidate therapies for the treatment of COVID-19. However, despite these advances the function of ACE homologues in non-human organisms is not yet fully understood. ACE homologues have been discovered in the tissues, body fluids and venom of species from diverse lineages and are known to have important functions in fertility, envenoming and insect–host defence mechanisms. We, therefore, further highlight the need for structural insight into insect and venom ACE homologues for the potential development of novel anti-venoms and insecticides.","Lubbe, Lizelle; Cozier, Gyles E.; Oosthuizen, Delia; Acharya, K.

We describe the case of a patient with newly diagnosed and symptomatic SIADH after receiving the second COVID-19 vaccination not explained otherwise. CASE PRESENTATION: A 79-year-old male person was admitted to the emergency department due to a worsening of his general health state expressed by weakness, fatigue and anorexia. Vital signs and clinical findings were normal, in particular the patient was considered to be euvolemic. Laboratory investigations revealed a serum sodium of 117 mmol/L, a serum osmolality of 241 mosm/kg and a urea of 1.2 mmol/L with creatinine within normal range. Urine chemistry showed a urine osmolality of 412 mosm/kg and urine sodium of 110 mmol/L. TSH, C-reactive protein, and basal cortisol levels were normal. Under therapy with balanced crystalloid fluids, hyponatremia worsened and in absence of diuretic medications, diagnosis of SIADH was made. Since fluid restriction was not sufficiently effective, oral urea was administered. Under this therapy regimen hyponatremia resolved.

Not all excess deaths have been directly related to COVID-19 infection. We investigated geographical and socioeconomic patterns in excess deaths for major groups of underlying causes during the pandemic. METHODS: Weekly mortality data from 27/12/2014 to 2/10/2020 for England and Wales were obtained from the Office of National Statistics. Negative binomial regressions were used to model death counts based on pre-pandemic trends for deaths caused directly by COVID-19 (and other respiratory causes) and those caused indirectly by it (cardiovascular disease or diabetes, cancers, and all other indirect causes) over the first 30 weeks of the pandemic (7/3/2020–2/10/2020). FINDINGS: There were 62,321 (95% CI: 58,849 to 65,793) excess deaths in England and Wales in the first 30 weeks of the pandemic. Of these, 46,221 (95% CI: 45,439 to 47,003) were attributable to respiratory causes, including COVID-19, and 16,100 (95% CI: 13,410 to 18,790) to other causes. Rates of all-cause excess mortality ranged from 78 per 100,000 in the South West of England and in Wales to 130 per 100,000 in the West Midlands; and from 93 per 100,000 in the most affluent fifth of areas to 124 per 100,000 in the most deprived. The most deprived areas had the highest rates of death attributable to COVID-19 and other indirect deaths, but there was no socioeconomic gradient for excess deaths from cardiovascular disease/diabetes and cancer. INTERPRETATION: During the first 30 weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic there was significant geographic and socioeconomic variation in excess deaths for respiratory causes, but not for cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer.

FCV is a highly infectious pathogen of cats and typically causes moderate, self-limiting acute oral and upper respiratory tract diseases or chronic oral diseases. In addition, in recent years, virulent, systemic FCV (vs-FCV) strains causing severe systemic diseases with a high mortality rate of up to 67% have been reported in cats. Although FCV vaccines are commercially available, their efficacy is limited due to antigenic diversity of FCV strains and short duration of immunity. In this study, we identified fexaramine as a potent inhibitor of FCV including vs-FCV strains in cell culture and demonstrated that fexaramine is a entry blocker for FCV by using various experiments including time-of-addition studies, generation of resistant viruses in cell culture and the reverse genetics system. A fexaramine resistant FCV mutant has a single amino acid change in the P2 domain of VP1 (the major capsid), and the importance of this mutation for conferring resistance was confirmed using the reverse genetics system. A comparative analysis of viral resistance was also performed using a peptidyl inhibitor (NPI52) targeting FCV 3C-like protease. Finally, the effects of combination treatment of fexaramine and NPI52 against FCV replication and emergence of resistant viruses were investigated in cell culture.","Kim, Yunjeong; Chang, Kyeong-Ok",Antiviral Res,497,21

Our systematic review examined the impact of these epidemics, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), on mental health among different population groups, drawing on their insights for recommendations for the current COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Searches were performed on PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, and Cochrane on April 4, 2020. Studies that had undefined mental health outcomes or did not use a validated scale for measure were excluded. Quality assessment was carried out via the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale. Results: We included 95 studies, most of which were conducted in Hong Kong (31.6%) and China (21.4%). A total of 30 (30.9%) studies are on the general public, 41 (42.2%) on healthcare workers, and 26 (26.6%) on patients and quarantined individuals. Furthermore, 36 (37.1%) of the studies are of high quality, 48 (49.5%) are of moderate quality, and 13 (13.4%) are of low quality. The most significant mental health outcomes reported include anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. The subgroups identified to have a higher risk of psychiatric symptoms among the general public include females, the elderly, individuals with chronic illness, migrant workers, and students. Long-term mental health impact was reported in some healthcare workers and epidemic patients, even up to 3 years in the former. Interestingly, when compared to non-quarantined groups, quarantine was not significantly associated with worse mental health outcomes. Conclusion: Important implications for the COVID-19 pandemic were highlighted. Respiratory epidemics pose a significant psychological morbidity onto many population groups. Psychological support for vulnerable groups, including healthcare workers and patients, should be implemented to prevent them from spiraling into clinical psychiatric conditions.","Luo, Yang; Chua, Cher Rui; Xiong, Zhonghui; Ho, Roger C.; Ho, Cyrus S.

In particular, precursor cell matrix/endothelial interactions determine retainment or release of hematopoietic cells from the bone marrow microenvironment. Consequently, changes in the affinity or quantitative expression of adhesion molecules on either the bone marrow stroma or the blood cell precursor component —during normal development or due to activation or a malignant process —will affect cell attachment. Adhesion molecules, therefore, are modulator molecules which alter the biological behavior of normal or leukemic hematopoietic cells, primarily in terms of migration and localization properties, although they also participate in many other cell functions such as cytotoxicity, antigen presentation and binding of viruses or cancer cells. Several membrane-bound adhesion molecules and, in some instances, their soluble counterparts which may be biologically active, have been described in acute myeloid leukemia. The potential diagnostic or physiological significance of leukocyte antigens with adhesive properties will be addressed in this comment.","Paietta, Elisabeth",Leukemia Research,497,16
