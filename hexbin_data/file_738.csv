On one hand, since they can disrupt standard genetic readout, they are avoided within the coding regions of most genes. On the other hand, they play important regulatory roles for the expression of those genes where they do occur. As a result, they are preserved among homologs and exhibit deep phylogenetic conservation. The combination of these two constraints results in a characteristic distribution of recoding sequences across genomes: they are highly conserved at specific locations while they are very rare in other locations. We term such sequences singular genomic elements to signify their rare occurrence and biological importance.","Baranov, Pavel V.; Gurvich, Olga",Recoding: Expansion of Decoding Rules Enriches Gene Expression,738,7

GAIA is designed as the first truly integrated global institution with a universal character with the aim to tackle the complex and multiversal governance challenges of humanity and the planet as a whole. This chapter marks both a legally and a scientifically fictitious account of the years from 2020 until 2048, from a dystopian and a utopian perspective, with the aim of highlighting the importance of cognition for legal and institutional change. The need for cognitive change is driven by changes in the environment, and by the challenges resulting from a perceived acceleration of the pace of change and the unprecedented levels of technological complexity. Both change and complexity increase the relevance of cognition, as laws and policies adopted in one area are more likely to affect their success or failure and that of the global governance system as a whole. Thus, this chapter predicts that the foremost necessity for law in the future is to build on novel and enhanced modes of human cognition to deal better with complexity and rapid change.","Neuwirth, Rostam J.",A Post-WTO International Legal Order,738,7

It is now possible to talk to a large number of people we have never met. Knowing the traits of a person from what he/she writes has become a new area of computational linguistics called Author Profiling. In this paper, we introduce a method for applying transfer learning to address the gender identification problem, which is a subtask of Author Profiling. Systems that use transfer learning are trained in a large number of tasks and then tested in their ability to learn new tasks. An example is to classify a new image into different possible classes, giving an example of each class. This differs from the traditional approach of standard machine learning techniques, which are trained in a single task and are evaluated in new examples of that task. The aim is to train a gender identification model on Twitter users using only their text samples in Spanish. The difference with other related works consists in the evaluation of different preprocessing techniques so that the transfer learning-based fine-tuning is more efficient.","Sotelo, Aquilino Francisco; Gómez-Adorno, Helena; Esquivel-Flores, Oscar; Bel-Enguix, Gemma",Pattern Recognition,738,7

This method is based on determining the type and quantity of cells of the different stages of the estrous cycle, since the hormonal changes that the vaginal mucosa undergoes during the estrous cycle are shown in the morphology of its epithelial cells. The canine female in her reproductive life goes through different phases of activity and hormonal rest that are repeated cyclically.

Systems combining both may benefit from the precise depth of the former and the high-density information of the latter, but a calibration process is necessary to relate them spatially. In this paper, we introduce COUPLED, a method that finds the extrinsic parameters to relate information between them. The method implies the use of a setup consisting of three planes with charuco patterns to find the planes in both systems. We obtain corresponding points in both systems through geometric relations between the planes. Afterward, we use these points and the Kabsch algorithm to compute the transformation that merges the planes between both systems. Compared to recent single plane algorithms, we obtain more accurate parameters, and only one pose is required. In the process, we develop a method to automatically find the calibration target using a plane detector instead of manually selecting the target in the LiDAR frame.","Montoya, Omar; Icasio, Octavio; Salas, Joaquín",Pattern Recognition,738,7

Finally the cars in the environment are represented in a 3D graphical interface.

34721,34721,34721,Boost and Burst: Bubbles in the Bitcoin Market,10.591904,0.40189508,2020-05-26,"This paper introduces the Dendrite Spherical Neuron (DSN) as an alternative to the Dendrite Ellipsoidal Neuron (DEN), in which hyperspheres group the patterns from different classes instead of hyperellipses. The reasoning behind DSN is simplifying the computation of DEN architecture, where a centroid and covariance matrix are two dendritic parameters, whereas, in DSN, the covariance matrix is replaced by a radius. This modification is useful to avoid singular covariance matrices since DEN requires measuring the Mahalanobis distance to classify patterns. The DSN training consists of determining the centroids of dendrites with the k-means algorithm, followed by calculating the radius of dendrites as the mean distance to the two nearest centroids, and finally determining the weights of a softmax function, with Stochastic Gradient Descent, at the output of the neuron. Besides, the Simulated Annealing automatically determines the number of dendrites that maximizes the classification accuracy. The DSN is applied to synthetic and real-world datasets. The experimental results reveal that DSN is competitive with Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) networks, with less complex architectures. Also, DSN tends to outperform the Dendrite Morphological Neuron (DMN), which uses hyperboxes. These findings suggest that the DSN is a potential alternative to MLP and DMN for pattern classification tasks.","Gómez-Flores, Wilfrido; Sossa-Azuela, Juan Humberto",Pattern Recognition,738,7

Empirical findings about lexical neighbourhood effects constrain models of human word encoding, which must also be consistent with what we know about neurophysiological mechanisms in the visual word recognition system. We suggest that the constraints learned from humans provide novel insights to subword encoding schemes. This paper shows that vectors trained with subword properties informed by psycholinguistic evidence are superior to those trained with ad hoc n-grams.

While numerous attempts have been made to address this problem, most existing methods relied on supervised models which significantly depend on large training data sets and manual feature engineering. Such methods are mostly constrained by their specificities that put aside the word order and ignore syntactic and semantic relationships. In this work, we rely on Neural Networks (NNs) which can learn rich dense representations of text data and enable the prediction of the textual similarity between the community questions.

We sought to determine whether an evidence-based, goal-directed checklist for donor management in intensive care units (ICUs) can reduce donor losses to cardiac arrest. METHODS/DESIGN: The DONORS study is a multicentre, cluster-randomised controlled trial with a 1:1 allocation ratio designed to compare an intervention group (goal-directed checklist for brain-dead potential organ donor management) with a control group (standard ICU care). The primary outcome is loss of potential donors due to cardiac arrest. Secondary outcomes are the number of actual organ donors and the number of solid organs recovered per actual donor. Exploratory outcomes include the achievement of relevant clinical goals during the management of brain-dead potential organ donors. The present statistical analysis plan (SAP) describes all primary statistical procedures that will be used to evaluate the results and perform exploratory and sensitivity analyses of the trial.

Measurement of compliance is useful in managing cardiovascular and respiratory failure; however, there are no contemporary means to assess intracranial compliance. Knowledge of intracranial compliance could complement ICP and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) monitoring in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and may enable a proactive approach to ICP management. In this proof-of-concept study, we aimed to capitalize on the physiologic principles of intracranial compliance and vascular reactivity to CO(2), and standard-of-care neurocritical care monitoring, to develop a method to assess dynamic intracranial compliance. METHODS: Continuous ICP and end-tidal CO(2) (ETCO(2)) data from children with severe TBI were collected after obtaining informed consent in this Institutional Review Board-approved study. An intracranial pressure-PCO(2) Compliance Index (PCI) was derived by calculating the moment-to-moment correlation between change in ICP and change in ETCO(2). As such, “good” compliance may be reflected by a lack of correlation between time-synched changes in ICP in response to changes in ETCO(2), and “poor” compliance may be reflected by a positive correlation between changes in ICP in response to changes in ETCO(2). RESULTS: A total of 978 h of ICP and ETCO(2) data were collected and analyzed from eight patients with severe TBI. Demographic and clinical characteristics included patient age 7.1 ± 5.8 years (mean ± SD); 6/8 male; initial Glasgow Coma Scale score 3 [3–7] (median [IQR]); 6/8 had decompressive surgery; 7.1 ± 1.4 ICP monitor days; ICU length of stay (LOS) 16.1 ± 6.8 days; hospital LOS 25.9 ± 8.4 days; and survival 100%. The mean PCI for all patients throughout the monitoring period was 0.18 ± 0.04, where mean ICP was 13.7 ± 2.1 mmHg. In this cohort, PCI was observed to be consistently above 0.18 by 12 h after monitor placement. Percent time spent with PCI thresholds > 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 were 62% [24], 38% [14], and 23% [15], respectively. The percentage of time spent with an ICP threshold > 20 mmHg was 5.1% [14.6]. CONCLUSIONS: Indirect assessment of dynamic intracranial compliance in TBI patients using standard-of-care monitoring appears feasible and suggests a prolonged period of derangement out to 5 days post-injury. Further study is ongoing to determine if the PCI—a new physiologic index, complements utility of ICP and/or CPP in guiding management of patients with severe TBI.

CagA and VacA are known virulence factors of H. pylori, which play a vital role in severe clinical outcomes. Additionally, the expression of outer membrane proteins (OMPs) helps H. pylori attach to gastric epithelial cells at the primary stage and increases the virulence of H. pylori. In this review, we have summarized the paralogs of H. pylori OMPs, their genomic loci, and the different receptors of OMPs identified so far. We focused on five OMPs, BabA (HopS), SabA (HopP), OipA (HopH), HopQ, and HopZ, and one family of OMPs: Hom. We highlight the coexpression of OMPs with other virulence factors and their relationship with clinical outcomes. In conclusion, OMPs are closely related to the pathogenic processes of adhesion, colonization, persistent infection, and severe clinical consequences. They are potential targets for the prevention and treatment of H. pylori–related diseases.","Xu, Chenjing; Soyfoo, Djaleel Muhammad; Wu, Yao; Xu, Shunfu",Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,738,7

Within the US ‘…there is a transformation in how criminals are using technology to invent new types of crime, and are creating new methods for committing traditional crimes’ (Wexler C. Critical issues in policing series new national commitment required: The changing nature of crime and criminal investigations police executive research forum, Washington, D.C. 20036 retrieved from https://www.policeforum.org/assets/ChangingNatureofCrime.pdf: 2018). In addition, criminals and terrorists have adopted more agile structural models and internationalized their operations. The UK regards organized crime as a threat to national security which costs the UK at least £32 billion each year, leads to loss of life, and can deprive people of their security and prosperity (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/official-development-assistance-oda-fco-programme-spend-objectives-2017-to-2018/combatting-serious-and-organised-crime-objectives-2017-to-2018). Given this threat and risk landscape, it has been argued that the ‘…science of criminal investigations is changing rapidly, and many law enforcement agencies are not prepared for the changes that are taking place’ (Wexler C. Critical issues in policing series new national commitment required: The changing nature of crime and criminal investigations police executive research forum, Washington, D.C. 20036 retrieved from https://www.policeforum.org/assets/ChangingNatureofCrime.pdf: 2018). The inherent complexity associated with serious and organized crime and terrorism calls for intervention and investigative strategies and practices rooted in a science-informed, evidence-based approach. Epidemiology, the science of public health, provides a unique approach that can be leveraged and tailored to support policing operations. The systems lens is key to the application of epidemiological models, and hence the Cynefin framework is introduced to help frame the policing problem space in terms of complexity. This paper presents a conceptual model that illustrates and operationalizes epidemiological practices to support policing operations.","Finnegan, Jennifer C.; Masys, Anthony J.",Science Informed Policing,738,7

This article translates organisational scholarship on professionals working in organisations to elucidate why traditional approaches to supporting employee mental health, which often ask employees to seek assistance from centralised resources that separate mental health personnel from frontline units, may be insufficient under crisis conditions. We identify a critical but often overlooked aspect of employee mental health support: how frontline professionals respond to mental health services. In high-risk, high-pressure fields, frontline professionals may perceive mental health support as coming at the expense of urgent frontline work goals (ie, patient care) and as clashing with their central professional identities (ie, as expert, self-reliant ironmen/women). FINDINGS: To address these pervasive goal and identity conflicts in professional organisations, we translate the results of a multiyear research study examining the US Army’s efforts to transform its mental health support during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. We highlight parallels between providing support to frontline military units and frontline healthcare units during COVID-19 and surface implications for structuring mental health supports during a crisis. We describe how an intentional organisational design used by the US Army that assigned specific mental health personnel to frontline units helped to mitigate professional goal and identity conflicts by creating personalised relationships and contextualising mental health offerings. CONCLUSION: Addressing frontline caregivers’ mental health needs is a vital part of health delivery organisations’ response to COVID-19, but without thoughtful organisational design, well-intentioned efforts may fall short. An approach that assigns individual mental health personnel to support specific frontline units may be particularly promising.","DiBenigno, Julia; Kerrissey, Michaela",,738,7

This virus was shown to infect farm animals including swine and cattle, and to efficiently replicate and transmit in ferrets, the animal model of choice for transmission of influenza A virus to humans. This partnering grant on IDV addressed the need for capacity building at EU level to improve the EU's scientific assessment capacity and international competitiveness. We have promoted cross‐disciplinary cooperation between the partner institutes representing six Member States (BE, FR, IT, LU, NL and SE). We have shown that the available antigen and genome test systems allow reliable influenza D diagnostics in partners laboratories, while for a few of the applied antibody testing methods adjustments are recommended. Tools were developed to study virus‐host range, with a gain of knowledge on host and tissue tropism of IDV in farm animals but also in wild life and very preliminary data was generated on human tissues. Serological results in European cattle suggest that influenza D virus is enzootic. Virus diversity is still unfolding: new virus introductions were identified, as well as new reassortants whose differential clinical impact or cross‐protection levels are still poorly understood. Considering drivers of emergence, IDV was in the top five in comparison with 29 other diseases. The main risk factors of IDV in cattle are related to the animal density, presence of respiratory clinical signs in cattle and contact rates between animals. Simplified quantitative IDV risk assessment exposure model indicated a possible infection of human by IDV through aerosols in cattle farms. Further studies are warranted to fully assess the risk of IDV for both animal and Human health in Europe.","Chiapponi, Chiara; Ducatez, Mariette; Faccini, Silvia; Foni, Emmanuela; Gaudino, Maria; Hägglund, Sara; Luppi, Andrea; Meyer, Gilles; Moreno, Ana; Näslund, Katarina; Nemanichvili, Nika; Oliva, Justine; Prosperi, Alice; Rosignoli, Carlo; Renault, Véronique; Saegerman, Claude; Sausy, Aurélie; Snoeck, Chantal; Valarcher, Jean‐Francois; Verheije, Helene; Zohari, Siamak",,738,7

Such codes often use a low-Mach number approximation, that require the iterative solution of a large system of linear equations at every time step. While the discretization routines in such a code can be improved by the use of, say, OpenMP or Cuda Approaches, it is important that the linear solver be able to perform well too. For Uintah the Hypre iterative solver has proved to solve such systems in a scalable way. The use of Hypre with OpenMP leads to at least 2x slowdowns due to OpenMP overheads, however. This behavior is analyzed and a solution proposed by using the MPI Endpoints approach is implemented within Hypre, where each team of threads acts as a different MPI rank. This approach minimized OpenMP synchronization overhead, avoided slowdowns, performed as fast or (up to 1.5x) faster than Hypre’s MPI only version, and allowed the rest of Uintah to be optimized using OpenMP. Profiling of the GPU version of Hypre showed the bottleneck to be the launch overhead of thousands of micro-kernels. The GPU performance was improved by fusing these micro kernels and was further optimized by using Cuda-aware MPI. The overall speedup of 1.26x to 1.44x was observed compared to the baseline GPU implementation.","Sahasrabudhe, Damodar; Berzins, Martin",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,738,7

While such clusters are expected to improve the performance of certain optimized HPC applications, it will also increase the difficulties for those users who have yet to adapt their codes or are starting from scratch with new programming paradigms. Since there are still no comprehensive automatic assistance mechanisms to enhance application performance on such systems, we propose a support framework for future HPC architectures, called EASEY (Enable exASclae for EverYone). Our solution builds on a layered software architecture, which offers different mechanisms on each layer for different tasks of tuning, including a workflow management system. This enables users to adjust the parameters on each of the layers, thereby enhancing specific characteristics of their codes.

However, it can quickly become a much more daunting task when users try to tune and optimize their kernels to obtain the highest performance. This is due to GPUs’ massive degree of parallelism, complex memory hierarchy, fine grain synchronization, and long memory access latency. Hence, users must carry out the complex tasks of profiling, analyzing, and tuning to reduce performance bottlenecks. Today’s GPUs can generate hundreds of performance events that comprehensively quantify the behavior of a kernel. Instead of relying on experts’ manual analysis, this paper targets using machine learning methods to generalize GPU performance counter data to determine the characteristics of a GPU kernel as they will reveal possible reasons for low performance. We choose a set of problem-independent counters as our inputs to design and compare three machine learning methods to automatically classify the execution behavior of a kernel. The experimental results on stencil computing kernels and sparse matrix multiplications show the machine learning models’ good accuracy, and demonstrate a feasible approach that is capable of classifying a kernel’s characterizations and suggesting changes to a skilled user, who can subsequently improve kernel performance with less guessing.","Zigon, Bob; Song, Fengguang",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,738,7

The model can be used for modeling atmospheric phenomena. The time integration scheme utilized enables for efficient direction splitting algorithm with finite difference solver. We show how to incorporate the terrain geometry into the simulation and how to perform the domain decomposition. The computational cost is linear [Formula: see text] over each sub-domain, and near to [Formula: see text] in parallel over 1024 processors, where N is the number of unknowns and c is the number of cores. This is even if we run the parallel simulator over complex terrain geometry. We analyze the parallel scalability experimentally up to 1024 processors over a PROMETHEUS Linux cluster with multi-core processors. The weak scalability of the code shows that increasing the number of sub-domains and processors from 4 to 1024, where each processor processes the subdomain of [Formula: see text] internal points ([Formula: see text] box), results in the increase of the total computational time from 120 s to 178 s for a single time step. Thus, we can perform a single time step with over 1,128,000,000 unknowns within 3 min. The number of unknowns results from the fact that we have three components of the velocity vector field, one component of the pressure, and one component of the temperature scalar field over 256,000,000 mesh points. The computation of the one time step takes 3 min on a Linux cluster. The direction splitting solver is not an iterative solver; it solves the system accurately since it is equivalent to Gaussian elimination. Our code is interfaced with the mesh generator reading the NASA database and providing the Earth terrain map. The goal of the project is to provide a reliable tool for parallel, fully three-dimensional computations of the atmospheric phenomena.","Paszyński, Maciej; Siwik, Leszek; Podsiadło, Krzysztof; Minev, Peter",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,738,7

Therefore, how to design 3D printed objects with less materials while maintain structural soundness is an important problem. The current treatment is to use thin shells. However, thin shells have low strength. In this paper, we use stiffeners to stiffen 3D thin-shell objects for increasing the strength of the objects and propose a stress guided optimization framework to achieve minimum material consumption. First, we carry out finite element calculations to determine stress distribution in 3D objects and use the stress distribution to guide random generation of some points called seeds. Then we map the 3D objects and seeds to a 2D space and create a Voronoi Diagram from the seeds. The stiffeners are taken to be the edges of the Voronoi Diagram whose intersections with the edges of each of the triangles used to represent the polygon models of the 3D objects are used to define stiffeners. The obtained intersections are mapped back to 3D polygon models and the cross-section size of stiffeners is minimized under the constraint of the required strength. Monte-Carlo simulation is finally introduced to repeat the process from random seed generation to cross-section size optimization of stiffeners.

The detection process on video images has been divided into 3 stages: determining the regions of interest (ROI) for a given frame, scanning the frame in ROI areas using the DNN-CNN classifier, in order to obtain a confidence of bee occurrence in each window in any position and any scale, and form one detection window from a cloud of windows provided by a positive classification. The process has been performed by a method of weighted cluster analysis, which is the main contribution of this work. The paper also describes a process of building the detector, during which the main challenge was the selection of clustering parameters that gives the smallest generalization error. The results of the experiments show the advantage of the cluster analysis method over the greedy method and the advantage of the optimization of cluster analysis parameters over standard-heuristic parameter values, provided that a sufficiently long learning fragment of the movie is used to optimize the parameters.","Dembski, Jerzy; Szymański, Julian",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,738,7

This paper presents a comparative analysis of time series databases in the context of edge computing for IoT and Smart Systems. The research focuses on the performance comparison between three time-series databases: TimescaleDB, InfluxDB, Riak TS, as well as two relational databases, PostgreSQL and SQLite. All selected solutions were tested while being deployed on a single-board computer, Raspberry Pi. For each of them, the database schema was designed, based on a data model representing sensor readings and their corresponding timestamps. For performance testing, we developed a small application that was able to simulate insertion and querying operations. The results of the experiments showed that for presented scenarios of reading data, PostgreSQL and InfluxDB emerged as the most performing solutions. For tested insertion scenarios, PostgreSQL turned out to be the fastest. Carried out experiments also proved that low-cost, single-board computers such as Raspberry Pi can be used as small-scale data aggregation nodes on edge device in low power wireless sensor networks, that often serve as a base for IoT-based smart systems.","Grzesik, Piotr; Mrozek, Dariusz",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,738,7

EM analysis is reliable but CPU intensive. In particular, multiple simulations entailed by parametric optimization or uncertainty quantification may considerably slow down the design processes. In order to address this problem, it is possible to employ fast metamodels. Here, the popular solution approaches are approximation surrogates, which are versatile and easily accessible. Notwithstanding, the major issue for conventional modeling methods is the curse of dimensionality. In the case of high-frequency components, an added difficulty are highly nonlinear outputs that need to be handled. A recently reported constrained modeling attempts to broaden the applicability of approximation surrogates by confining the surrogate model setup to a small subset of the parameter space. The said region contains the parameter vectors corresponding to high-quality designs w.r.t. the considered figures of interest, which allows for a dramatic reduction of the number of training samples needed to render reliable surrogates without formally restricting the parameter ranges. This paper reviews the recent techniques employing these concepts and provides real-world illustration examples of antenna and microwave structures.","Pietrenko-Dabrowska, Anna; Koziel, Slawomir; Leifsson, Leifur",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,738,7

However, those algorithms just adopt to the simple or relative uniform data, when the data distribution is complex, some algorithms will lose efficiency.

We divide the queries recursively to reduce the added noise, which can reduce computation error when there exists query hot spot in the workload. We conduct extensive evaluation over six real-world datasets to examine the performance of our approach.

Some video-related fields, e.g., traffic measurement and the metrics for Quality of Experience, are based on video flow identification. However, video flow identification faces challenges. Firstly, the increasing adoption of Transport Layer Security makes payload-based methods no longer applicable. Secondly, traffic features differ when generated by different streaming protocols. This paper proposes a video flow identification method, called ITP-KNN, which utilizes the intermittent traffic pattern-related features (ITP) and the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The intermittent traffic pattern is caused by fragmented transmission, which is common among video streamings generated by different streaming protocols. Therefore, the intermittent traffic pattern is useful for overcoming the above challenges and then differentiating video traffic from not-video traffic. We develop a set of features to describe the intermittent traffic pattern. Preliminary results show the promise of ITP-KNN, yielding high identification recall and precision over a range of video content and encoding qualities.","Liu, Youting; Li, Shu; Zhang, Chengwei; Zheng, Chao; Sun, Yong; Liu, Qingyun",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,738,7

Recently, network embedding has proven an important approach to learn low-dimensional representations of vertexes in networks. Most of the existing approaches only focus on topological information without embedding rich nodal information due to the lack of an effective mechanism to capture the interaction between two different information modalities. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel deep attributed network embedding framework named DeepAD to differentiate anomalies whose behaviors obviously deviate from the majority. DeepAD (i) simultaneously capture both of the highly non-linear topological structure and node attributes information based on the graph convolutional network (GCN) and (ii) preserve various interaction proximities between two different information modalities to make them complement each other towards a unified representation for anomaly detection.

Approaches to applying machine learning in modeling and prediction of music often apply little, if any, music theory as part of their algorithms. In contrast, we propose an approach which employs minimal music theory to embed the relationships between notes and chord structure explicitly. We extend the Tonnetz lattice, originally developed by Euler to introduce a metric between notes, in order to induce a metric between chords. Multidimensional scaling is employed to embed chords in twenty dimensions while best preserving this music-theoretic metric. We then demonstrate the utility of this embedding in the prediction of the next chord in a musical piece, having observed a short sequence of previous chords. Applying a standard training, test, and validation methodology to a dataset of Bach chorales, we achieve an accuracy rate of 50.4% on validation data, compared to an expected rate of 0.2% when guessing the chord randomly. This suggests that using Euler’s Tonnetz for embedding provides a framework in which machine learning tools can excel in classification and prediction tasks with musical data.","Aminian, Manuchehr; Kehoe, Eric; Ma, Xiaofeng; Peterson, Amy; Kirby, Michael",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,738,7

Initially, when implementation was made with the use of Cartesian Coordinates, simulation takes a lot of time to create a model (mean 746.7[sec] with the median 569.1[sec]) and additionally requires restarts of the algorithm, also often exceeds acceptable (given a priori) time for the computational experiment. Because of that, authors attempted changing the coordinate system to Spherical Coordinates (in a few previous projects it leads to improving the efficiency of implementation). After changing the way that 3D point is represented in 3D space the time required to make a successful model reduced to the mean 25.3[sec] with a median 18.5[s] (alongside with lowering the number of necessary algorithm restarts) which gives a significant difference in the efficiency of model’s creation.

This serves as a key motivation towards a study of the robustness of resource allocations required to maintain and guarantee a desired level of performance. Performance modeling and evaluation is often utilized to understand and predict the behavior of the application and the computational system from a performance point of view. In prior work, performance modeling for evaluating response times of static resource allocations in PDC systems was introduced by the authors as a proof of concept for validating the use of the performance evaluation process algebra (PEPA) for analyzing the robustness of static resource allocations. Herein, the authors present numerical modeling of several static resource allocations to evaluate their robustness in the presence of compound perturbations generated as combinations of variations in application workload and machine availability. The novelty of the approach is to introduce the compound effect as the variability of both, application workload and processor/machine availability, into the performance modeling of the overall computational system. The performance is obtained as a parallel execution time via a numerical analysis of the modeled execution of applications on non-dedicated parallel computational resources. A significant improvement in the robustness value (up to 143%) among the mappings yielding equal parallel execution times has been demonstrated via the analysis of the results. This notable difference in the robustness values strongly indicates the benefit of selecting one mapping versus the other for guaranteeing the best execution performance.","Srivastava, Srishti; Banicescu, Ioana; Sanders, William S.",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,738,7

These methods are based on selection and extraction of features. The most commonly used method in literature, regarding the later, is the analysis of the main components of pca. The natural problem of this method is the possibility of applying it to linear space. It is a natural problem to develop the pca concept for cases of nonlinear feature spaces, optimization of feature selection for principal components and the inclusion of classes in the task of supervised learning. An important problem in the perspective of machine learning is not only a reduction of features and attributes but also separation of classes.

The purpose of the research is to develop a method of extracting features with the application of the stochastic gradient method in the task diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in children.

The input data consisted of 184 signals of RR-intervals from 29 patients with ICD, recorded both during normal heartbeat and arrhythmia. For every signal we generated 47 descriptors with different signal analysis methods. Then, we performed feature selection using several methods and used selected feature for building predictive models with the help of Random Forest algorithm. Entire modelling procedure was performed within 5-fold cross-validation procedure that was repeated 10 times. Results were stable and repeatable. The results obtained (AUC = 0.82, MCC = 0.45) are statistically significant and show that RR intervals carry information about arrhythmia onset. The sample size used in this study was too small to build useful medical predictive models, hence large data sets should be explored to construct models of sufficient quality to be of direct utility in medical practice.","Kitlas Golińska, Agnieszka; Lesiński, Wojciech; Przybylski, Andrzej; Rudnicki, Witold R.",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,738,7

In sudden cardiac events, availability of a nearby AED is crucial for the surviving of cardiac arrest patients. The common method uses historical Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) data for AED placement optimization. But historical data often do not cover the entire area of investigation. The goal of this work is to develop an approach to improve the method based on historical data for AED placement. To this end, we have developed a risk-based method which generates artificial OHCAs based on a risk model. We compare our risk-based method with the one based on historical data using real Singapore OHCA occurrences from Pan-Asian Resuscitation Outcome Study (PAROS). Results show that to deploy a large number of AEDs the risk-based method outperforms the method purely using historical data on the testing dataset. This paper describes our risk-based AED placement method, discusses experimental results, and outlines future work.","Derevitskii, Ivan; Kogtikov, Nikita; Lees, Michael H.; Cai, Wentong; Ong, Marcus E.

Ensuring proper level of security, protection and continuity of failure-free operation seems to be not a completely solved issue. In the article, a system is present allowing to detect different types of anomalies and failures/damage in critical infrastructure of railway transport realized by means of Power Line Communication. There is also described the structure of the examined LED Sign Communications Network. Other discussed topics include significant security problems and maintenance of LED sign system which have direct impact on correct operation of critical communication infrastructure. A two-stage method of anomaly/damage detection is proposed. In the first step, all the outlying observations are detected and eliminated from the analysed network traffic parameters by means of the Cook’s distance. So prepared data is used in stage two to create models on the basis of autoregressive neural network describing variability of the analysed LED Sign Communications Network parameters. Next, relations between the expected network traffic and its real variability are examined in order to detect abnormal behaviour which could indicate an attempt of an attack or failure/damage. There is also proposed a procedure of recurrent learning of the exploited neural networks in case there emerge significant fluctuations in the real PLC traffic. A number of scientific research was realized, which fully confirmed efficiency of the proposed solution and accuracy of autoregressive type of neural network for prediction of the analysed time series.","Andrysiak, Tomasz; Saganowski, Łukasz",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,738,7

Although the list of causative agents is long, the lung’s response to injury is limited resulting in similar patterns of disease irrespective of the cause. From a pathological perspective, acute lung injury refers to a group of entities that present with acute or subacute disease. These conditions are characterized by particular histological patterns including diffuse alveolar damage, acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia, organizing pneumonia, and eosinophilic pneumonia and clinically correspond to the varying degrees of acute respiratory distress syndrome (Patel et al, Chest 125:197–202, 2004; Beasley et al, Arch Pathol Lab Med 126:1064–1070, 2002; Avecillas et al, Clin Chest Med 27:549–557, 2006; Cottin, Cordier, Semin Respir Crit Care Med 33:462–475, 2012; Ferguson et al, Intensive Care Med 38:1573–1582, 2012). In most cases, the underlying cause will not be apparent from the histological findings requiring close correlation with clinical history and laboratory findings to determine the etiology. Nevertheless, careful search for infectious organisms with application of histochemical and immunohistochemical stains should be performed in all cases in order to identify cases that benefit from more targeted treatment.","Weissferdt, Annikka",Diagnostic Thoracic Pathology,738,1

However, there are few researches on how the people who pay attention to anxiety and depression coping with negative psychological during the epidemic or major disaster. This study aimed to identify what behaviors can effectively reduce negative emotions during the epidemic. METHODS: From February 1, to March 8 in 2020, we conducted a web-based survey and collected information on general demographic data. The probable depression, anxiety symptoms and coping behaviors was assessed by Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Generalized anxiety disorder-7 and the self-made Coping Behaviors Questionnaires. RESULT: Among 17249 responders, 7923 and 9326 completed the assessment of depression and anxiety respectively, and all responders finished the assessment of the coping behaviors questionnaires. Our survey population had a high prevalence rate of possible depression disorders and anxiety disorders were34.66% and 56.93%, respectively. Those who are old, female, low education, low income, and cohabiting were more likely to suffer depression and/or anxiety. Students are a high-risk group suffering from depression and/or anxiety. After adjusting for social-demographic factors (e.g. age, sex), depression and anxiety were positively associated with self-injury, doing housework, and having sex or masturbating and negatively associated with singing, drawing, or writing, dating friends online, singing, attending lectures, and doing yoga. CONCLUSION: During the epidemic, our findings identify some spontaneous coping behaviors that can probably relieve the psychological impact of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic.","Ge, Fenfen; Wan, Mentong; Zheng, Anni; Luo, Guan; Zhang, Jun",Precis Clin Med,738,1

Error tolerance may lead to death threats for the patient in the healthcare system. However, practically the healthcare industry faces many manual error incidences, inadequate staffing, aging population, etc. These challenges will increase the stress level and disturbs the psychological as well as physical health of the healthcare practitioner. Internet of things (IoT) technique is adept to tackle such outbreaks by providing complete digitization of healthcare systems. However, IoT application deployment comes with many security threats and attacks challenges. Here it is worth mentioning that to implement a robust security solution, the comprehensive analysis of attack must carry out. This paper contributes by analyzing two preeminent attacks, the Denial of service (DoS) and version Number attack on the healthcare system. DoS rapidly destroy the network whereas version number haltingly takes control of the network. The paper further critically analyzes the performance and severity of these two attacks based on discrete parameters like routing metric, power consumption, number of packets received, number of expected transmissions, beacon interval, and proposes the robust solution.","Ambarkar, Smita Sanjay; Shekokar, Narendra",Proceeding of First Doctoral Symposium on Natural Computing Research,738,7

Endovascular therapy (EVT) for acute stroke caused by large vessel occlusion reduces severe disabilities. OBJECTIVES We aimed to investigate the relationship between EVT and decompressive hemicraniectomy (DH) in patients with cardioembolic proximal intracranial occlusion in the anterior circulation (CPIOAC) using the data from the Recovery by Endovascular Salvage for Cerebral Ultra-acute Embolism (RESCUE)-Japan Registry 2. METHODS Among 2,420 patients in the RESCUE-Japan Registry 2, 555 patients aged 20-80 years with acute cardioembolic occlusion of the internal carotid artery and/or the first segment of the middle cerebral artery were included. The primary outcome was DH. Secondary outcomes were any type of intracranial hemorrhage, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage indicating neurological worsening of >4 points on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale within 72 h after the onset of stroke, and recurrence of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within 90 days. RESULTS The median age was 73 years (66-77 years), and 360 patients (65%) were male. DH was performed in 1 of 374 patients in the EVT group and 5 of 181 patients in the no-EVT group (p = 0.032). The incidence of any type of intracranial hemorrhage and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 72 h and recurrence of stroke or TIA within 90 days were similar between both groups. CONCLUSIONS EVT may reduce DH in patients with CPIOAC without increasing intracranial hemorrhage.","Matsukawa, Hidetoshi; Kiura, Yoshihiro; Sakai, Nobuyuki; Yamagami, Hiroshi; Uchida, Kazutaka; Morimoto, Takeshi; Kageyama, Hiroto; Yoshimura, Shinichi",Cerebrovascular diseases,738,7

However, these kinds of restrictive policies, when taken in times of pandemic, are likely to reverberate on reception countries as boomerangs taking the form of illegal immigration and smuggling of migrants, causing an increment of asylum applications in contexts where the risks attached to the pandemic would make it very hard for States to comply with their legal obligations pursuant to international asylum and human rights law. However, the adoption of appropriate measures with the purpose of guaranteeing both compliance with pertinent international obligations and protection of public health against the spread of a pandemic appears possible, especially if accompanied by the development of ad hoc schemes of international cooperation, which would certainly represent the best possible approach to adequately reconcile all the different needs involved.","Lenzerini, F.",Diritti Umani E Diritto Internazionale,738,24

This study stresses the need to work towards achieving quality education, and to prepare future teachers in sustainability competencies. The research questions are related to the key competencies necessary to accelerate change and to how to increase awareness and literacy of the SDGs in higher education. A quantitative methodology aimed at improving the training of future teachers who engage in reflective and critical thinking was used. Data were gathered on the level of reflection of students from three Spanish universities. The instrument used, the Reflective Practice Questionnaire, includes concepts defined in the literature related to reflective capacity such as Reflection in Action, Reflection on Action and Reflection with Others. The results of the study provide quantitative data showing a positive impact of reflective practice on future teachers. Education for sustainable development requires participatory methods that motivate and empower students to change their behaviour. Reflective practice must be accompanied by processes of communication and supervision that encourage confidence and the desire to improve. Training future teachers in reflective practice should be a differentiating element to achieve quality education, allowing adaptation to current and future adverse situations.","Fuertes-Camacho, M.

Despite the recent surge of investigations about different aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we still know little about the effects of city size on the propagation of this disease in urban areas. Here we investigate how the number of cases and deaths by COVID-19 scale with the population of Brazilian cities. Our results indicate small towns are proportionally more affected by COVID-19 during the initial spread of the disease, such that the cumulative numbers of cases and deaths per capita initially decrease with population size. However, during the long-term course of the pandemic, this urban advantage vanishes and large cities start to exhibit higher incidence of cases and deaths, such that every 1% rise in population is associated with a 0.14% increase in the number of fatalities per capita after about four months since the first two daily deaths. We argue that these patterns may be related to the existence of proportionally more health infrastructure in the largest cities and a lower proportion of older adults in large urban areas. We also find the initial growth rate of cases and deaths to be higher in large cities; however, these growth rates tend to decrease in large cities and to increase in small ones over time.","Ribeiro, Haroldo V.; Sunahara, Andre S.; Sutton, Jack; Perc, Matjaž; Hanley, Quentin S.",PLoS One,738,28
