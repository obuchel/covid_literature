With the aim of exploring a novel therapeutic approach, we chose GraXRS, a Two-Component System (TCS) that determines bacterial resilience against host innate immune barriers, as an alternative target to disarm S. aureus. Following a drug repurposing methodology, and taking advantage of a singular staphylococcal strain that lacks the whole TCS machinery but the target one, we screened 1.280 off-patent FDA-approved drug for GraXRS inhibition. Reinforcing the connection between this signaling pathway and redox sensing, we found that antioxidant and redox-active molecules were capable of reducing the expression of the GraXRS regulon. Among all the compounds, verteporfin (VER) was really efficient in enhancing PMN-mediated bacterial killing, while topical administration of such drug in a murine model of surgical wound infection significantly reduced the bacterial load. Experiments relying on the chemical mimicry existing between VER and heme group suggest that redox active residue C227 of GraS participates in the inhibition exerted by this FDA-approved drug. Based on these results, we propose VER as a promising candidate for sensitizing S. aureus that could be helpful to combat persistent or antibiotic-resistant infections.","Prieto, Juana María; Rapún-Araiz, Beatriz; Gil, Carmen; Penadés, José R.; Lasa, Iñigo; Latasa, Cristina",Sci Rep,661,24

Mechanical ventilation is an important and basic method of maintaining life support in the ICU, but prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV) is associated with a prolonged length of hospital stay and other adverse outcomes. Therefore, we conducted this retrospective study to describe morbidity and further try to identify the risk factors for PMV in critically ill obstetric women. METHODS: The clinical data were obtained from a single-centre retrospective comparative study of 143 critically ill obstetric patients at a tertiary teaching hospital in mainland China between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2019. PMV was defined as a mechanical ventilation length of more than 24 h. Clinical and obstetric parameters were collected to analyse the risk factors for PMV. Patients were separated into groups with and without PMV. Potential risk factors were identified by univariate testing. Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate independent predictors of PMV. RESULTS: Out of 29,236 hospital deliveries, 265 critically ill obstetric patients entered the ICU. One hundred forty-five (54.7%) of them were treated with mechanical ventilation. Two were excluded because of death within 24 h. Sixty-five critically ill obstetric patients (45.5%) underwent PMV. The independent risk factors for PMV included estimated blood loss (odds ratio (OR) =1.296, P=0.029), acute kidney injury (AKI) (OR=4.305, P=0.013), myocardial injury (OR=4.586, P=0.012), and PaO(2)/FiO(2) (OR=0.989, P< 0.001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve based on the predicted probability of the logistic regression was 0.934. CONCLUSIONS: Estimated blood loss, AKI, myocardial injury, and PaO(2)/FiO(2) were independent risk factors for PMV in critically ill obstetric patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thin-section non-contrast chest CT images from 203 patients (115 males, 88 females; age range, 31–89 years) between January 2017 and May 2017 were included in the study, of which 150 cases had extensive lung parenchymal disease involving more than 40% of the parenchymal area. Parenchymal diseases included interstitial lung disease (ILD), emphysema, nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease, tuberculous destroyed lung, pneumonia, lung cancer, and other diseases. Five experienced radiologists manually drew the margin of the lungs, slice by slice, on CT images. The dataset used to develop the network consisted of 157 cases for training, 20 cases for development, and 26 cases for internal validation. Two-dimensional (2D) U-Net and three-dimensional (3D) U-Net models were used for the task. The network was trained to segment the lung parenchyma as a whole and segment the right and left lung separately. The University Hospitals of Geneva ILD dataset, which contained high-resolution CT images of ILD, was used for external validation. RESULTS: The Dice similarity coefficients for internal validation were 99.6 ± 0.3% (2D U-Net whole lung model), 99.5 ± 0.3% (2D U-Net separate lung model), 99.4 ± 0.5% (3D U-Net whole lung model), and 99.4 ± 0.5% (3D U-Net separate lung model). The Dice similarity coefficients for the external validation dataset were 98.4 ± 1.0% (2D U-Net whole lung model) and 98.4 ± 1.0% (2D U-Net separate lung model). In 31 cases, where the extent of ILD was larger than 75% of the lung parenchymal area, the Dice similarity coefficients were 97.9 ± 1.3% (2D U-Net whole lung model) and 98.0 ± 1.2% (2D U-Net separate lung model). CONCLUSION: The deep neural network achieved excellent performance in automatically delineating the boundaries of lung parenchyma with extensive pathological conditions on non-contrast chest CT images.","Yoo, Seung-Jin; Yoon, Soon Ho; Lee, Jong Hyuk; Kim, Ki Hwan; Choi, Hyoung In; Park, Sang Joon; Goo, Jin Mo",Korean J Radiol,661,19

MAYV infection causes severe joint and muscle pain that can persist for weeks to months. Currently, there are no approved vaccines or therapeutics to prevent MAYV infection or treat the debilitating musculoskeletal inflammatory disease. In the current study, a prophylactic MAYV vaccine expressing the complete viral structural polyprotein was developed based on a non-replicating human adenovirus V (AdV) platform. Vaccination with AdV-MAYV elicited potent neutralizing antibodies that protected WT mice against MAYV challenge by preventing viremia, reducing viral dissemination to tissues and mitigating viral disease. The vaccine also prevented viral-mediated demise in IFN⍺R1(-/-) mice. Passive transfer of immune serum from vaccinated animals similarly prevented infection and disease in WT mice as well as virus-induced demise of IFN⍺R1(-/-) mice, indicating that antiviral antibodies are protective. Immunization with AdV-MAYV also generated cross-neutralizing antibodies against two related arthritogenic alphaviruses–chikungunya and Una viruses. These cross-neutralizing antibodies were protective against lethal infection in IFN⍺R1(-/-) mice following challenge with these heterotypic alphaviruses. These results indicate AdV-MAYV elicits protective immune responses with substantial cross-reactivity and protective efficacy against other arthritogenic alphaviruses. Our findings also highlight the potential for development of a multi-virus targeting vaccine against alphaviruses with endemic and epidemic potential in the Americas.","Powers, John M.; Haese, Nicole N.; Denton, Michael; Ando, Takeshi; Kreklywich, Craig; Bonin, Kiley; Streblow, Cassilyn E.; Kreklywich, Nicholas; Smith, Patricia; Broeckel, Rebecca; DeFilippis, Victor; Morrison, Thomas E.; Heise, Mark T.; Streblow, Daniel N.",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,661,1

On the supply side, Bangladesh’s supply of grain products has increased substantially, with an average annual growth rate of 1.99 million tons in 1998–2018. Domestic grain production, especially rice production, accounted for the largest proportion in its structure. However, under the constraints of resources and environment, imports and international aid were needed to ensure a stable and sustainable grain supply. On the demand side, Bangladesh’s demand for grain products continued to grow at an average annual rate of 2.09 million tons and its structure was constantly diversified. In recent years, domestic grain production has fully met the grain demand for food use, but the overall grain supply dependence on foreign gradually increased. From the analysis of the influencing factors, the grain supply, especially the domestic production of rice and maize, had the greatest impact on the balance of grain supply-demand in Bangladesh. Moreover, multiple cropping index, chemical fertilizer application per hectare and irrigation rate were the three main factors affecting grain production. As a typical agricultural country, Bangladesh’s grain security was faced with challenges, such as high population density, insufficient cultivated land resources, international grain trade and frequent natural disasters. It is suggested that its government should strengthen scientific and technological research, adjust agricultural structure, improve the efficient utilization of agricultural resources and grain circulation systems, and balance the grain demand between food use and indirect use, so as to achieve complete grain self-sufficiency and overall grain security.","Jiang, Luguang; Wu, Si; Liu, Ye; Yang, Cheng",PLoS One,661,24

Therefore, the search for compounds of natural origin with antiviral activity is an important area of research. In the present study, three compounds were isolated and identified from seeds of Tabernaemontana cymosa plants. The in vitro antiviral effect of those compounds and voacangine against different DENV strains was assessed using different experimental approaches: compounds added before the infection (Pre), at the same time with the virus (Trans), after the infection (Post) or compounds present in all moments of the experiment (Pre-Trans-Post, Combined treatment). In silico studies (docking and molecular dynamics) were also performed to explain the possible antiviral mechanisms. The identified compounds were three structural analogs of voacangine (voacangine-7-hydroxyindolenine, rupicoline and 3-oxo-voacangine). In the Pre-treatment, only voacangine-7-hydroxyindolenine and rupicoline inhibited the infection caused by the DENV-2/NG strain (16.4% and 29.6% infection, respectively). In the Trans-treatment approach, voacangine, voacangine-7-hydroxyindolenine and rupicoline inhibited the infection in both DENV-2/NG (11.2%, 80.4% and 75.7% infection, respectively) and DENV-2/16681 infection models (73.7%, 74.0% and 75.3% infection, respectively). The latter strain was also inhibited by 3-oxo-voacangine (82.8% infection). Moreover, voacangine (most effective virucidal agent) was also effective against one strain of DENV-1 (DENV-1/WestPac/74) and against the third strain of DENV-2 (DENV-2/S16803) (48.5% and 32.4% infection, respectively). Conversely, no inhibition was observed in the post-treatment approach. The last approach (combined) showed that voacangine, voacangine-7-hydroxyindolenine and rupicoline inhibited over 90% of infections (3.5%, 6.9% and 3.5% infection, respectively) of both strains (DENV-2/NG and DENV-2/16681). The free energy of binding obtained with an in silico approach was favorable for the E protein and compounds, which ranged between −5.1 and −6.3 kcal/mol. Finally, the complex formed between DENV-2 E protein and the best virucidal compound was stable for 50 ns. Our results show that the antiviral effect of indole alkaloids derived from T. cymose depends on the serotype and the virus strain.","Monsalve-Escudero, Laura Milena; Loaiza-Cano, Vanessa; Zapata-Cardona, Maria Isabel; Quintero-Gil, Diana Carolina; Hernández-Mira, Estiven; Pájaro-González, Yina; Oliveros-Díaz, Andrés Felipe; Diaz-Castillo, Fredyc; Quiñones, Wistón; Robledo, Sara; Martinez-Gutierrez, Marlen",Plants (Basel),661,17

We aimed to examine the prevalence of smoking HTPs among a working population in Japan. SETTING, DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: In 2018, we conducted a cross-sectional study comprised of 7714 retail business workers in the service industry in Japan. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: For the definition of smoking HTPs, we identified current HTP smokers who only smoked HTPs, using five mutual categories of current smoking status (never, former, HTPs only, combustible cigarettes only and dual smokers who smoked both combustible cigarettes and HTPs). Occupational classes were classified into office workers (eg, upper non-manual workers) and other workers. ORs and 95% CIs of office workers were estimated for HTP usage, adjusted for age, sex, employment type and cigarette smoking-related health knowledge. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of smoking HTPs was 3.0% (male 5.0%, female 2.2%). The prevalence of HTP smokers differed across occupational classes (5.6% in office workers vs 2.5% in others; p<0.05). Compared with other workers, the adjusted odds of office workers for smoking HTPs remained elevated (OR: 1.97, 95% CI: 1.40 to 2.77). Sensitivity analyses with workers of all smoking status showed the same pattern. When stratified by sex, the occupational difference only remained significant in male workers. CONCLUSIONS: We found a positive occupational difference in smoking HTPs, particularly among male workers in the retail sector in Japan. National tobacco control should explicitly address this occupational gap and further encourage individuals to quit smoking.","Myagmar-Ochir, Enkhtuguldur; Kaneko, Makiko; Tomiyama, Kiyomi; Zaitsu, Masayoshi; Watanabe, Shuichi; Nishino, Yoshitaka; Takahashi, Kyo; Haruyama, Yasuo; Kobashi, Gen",BMJ Open,661,1

Numerous graph-based methods have been applied to biomedical graphs for predicting ADRs in pre-marketing phases. ADR detection in post-market surveillance is no less important than pre-marketing assessment, and ADR detection with large-scale clinical data have attracted much attention in recent years. However, there are not many studies considering graph structures from clinical data for detecting an ADR signal, which is a pair of a prescription and a diagnosis that might be a potential ADR. In this study, we develop a novel graph-based framework for ADR signal detection using healthcare claims data. We construct a Drug-disease graph with nodes representing the medical codes. The edges are given as the relationships between two codes, computed using the data. We apply Graph Neural Network to predict ADR signals, using labels from the Side Effect Resource database. The model shows improved AUROC and AUPRC performance of 0.795 and 0.775, compared to other algorithms, showing that it successfully learns node representations expressive of those relationships. Furthermore, our model predicts ADR pairs that do not exist in the established ADR database, showing its capability to supplement the ADR database.","Kwak, Heeyoung; Lee, Minwoo; Yoon, Seunghyun; Chang, Jooyoung; Park, Sangmin; Jung, Kyomin",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,661,24

Classical image registration techniques oftentimes fail in vicinity of the tumor, where the enclosing structures are massively altered from one scan to another. Still, locations nearby the tumor or the resection cavity are the most relevant for evaluating tumor progression patterns and for comparing pre- and post-operative radiomic signatures. We address this issue by exploring a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach. An artificial agent is self-taught to find the optimal path towards a target driven by a feedback signal from the environment. Incorporating anatomical guidance, we restrict the agent’s search space to surgery-unaffected structures only. By defining landmarks for each patient individually, we aim to obtain a patient-specific representation of its differential radiomic features across different time points for enhancing image alignment. Estimated landmarks reach a remarkable mean distance error around 3 mm. In addition, they show a high agreement with expert annotations on a challenging dataset of MR scans from the brain before and after tumor resection.","Waldmannstetter, Diana; Navarro, Fernando; Wiestler, Benedikt; Kirschke, Jan S.; Sekuboyina, Anjany; Molero, Ester; Menze, Bjoern H.",Biomedical Image Registration,661,24

Here, we identify a previously unidentified immune-metabolic axis by which cells respond to purine nucleosides and trigger a type I interferon-β (IFN-β) response. We find that depletion of ADA2, an ectoenzyme that catabolizes extracellular dAdo to dIno, or supplementation of dAdo or dIno stimulates IFN-β. Under conditions of reduced ADA2 enzyme activity, dAdo is transported into cells and undergoes catabolysis by the cytosolic isoenzyme ADA1, driving intracellular accumulation of dIno. dIno is a functional immunometabolite that interferes with the cellular methionine cycle by inhibiting SAM synthetase activity. Inhibition of SAM-dependent transmethylation drives epigenomic hypomethylation and overexpression of immune-stimulatory endogenous retroviral elements that engage cytosolic dsRNA sensors and induce IFN-β. We uncovered a previously unknown cellular signaling pathway that responds to extracellular DNA–derived metabolites, coupling nucleoside catabolism by adenosine deaminases to cellular IFN-β production.","Dhanwani, Rekha; Takahashi, Mariko; Mathews, Ian T.; Lenzi, Camille; Romanov, Artem; Watrous, Jeramie D.; Pieters, Bartijn; Hedrick, Catherine C.; Benedict, Chris A.; Linden, Joel; Nilsson, Roland; Jain, Mohit; Sharma, Sonia",Sci Adv,661,12

Compared with solution electrospinning (e-spinning), melt e-spinning is more bio-friendly without toxic solvent participation, which provides the possibility of in situ e-spinning on wounds directly. However, previously reported melt e-spinning devices were usually bulky and cumbersome due to their necessary heating unit, and different components were separated to avoid electrostatic interference. RESULTS: In this article, we report on a self-powered hand-held melt e-spinning gun which can work without any external power supply (outdoors). The problem of electrostatic interference for this integrated device was solved by using a special high heat transfer insulation unit. The apparatus is easy and safe to operate by a single hand due to its small volume (24 × 6 × 13 cm(3)) and light weight (about 450 g). Some biodegradable polymers, for example, polycaprolactone (PCL) fibers were successful e-spun onto wounds directly by using this dressing gun. CONCLUSIONS: PCL fibrous membrane has good biocompatibility and can be in situ electrospun to wound surface as a wound dressing by the portable melt e-spinning gun. Besides wound dressing, this hand-held melt e-spinning gun may be used in 3D printing and experimental teaching demonstration aids.","Zhao, Ying-Tao; Zhang, Jun; Gao, Yuan; Liu, Xiao-Fei; Liu, Jiang-Jun; Wang, Xiao-Xiong; Xiang, Hong-Fei; Long, Yun-Ze",J Nanobiotechnology,661,24

This so-called dysbiosis of the microbiome seems to be involved in immunological responses and may influence outcomes even in individuals who are not as vulnerable as a critically ill ICU population. It is therefore probable that dysbiosis of the microbiome is a consequence of critical illness and may, subsequently, shape an inadequate response to these circumstances. Bronchoscopic studies have revealed that the carina represents the densest site of bacterial DNA along healthy airways, with a tapering density with further bifurcations. This likely reflects the influence of micro-aspiration as the primary route of microbial immigration in healthy adults. Though bacterial DNA density grows extremely sparse at smaller airways, bacterial signal is still consistently detectable in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, likely reflecting the fact that lavage via a wedged bronchoscope samples an enormous surface area of small airways and alveoli. The dogma of lung sterility also violated numerous observations that long predated culture-independent microbiology.

The derivative has been reported to exert anti-obesity effect; however, its inhibitory effect on protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) has not been investigated. In the previous study, the presence of the farnesyl group in the structure of 2-arylbenzofurans was found to have positive influences on their pancreatic lipase inhibitory activity. In the present study, we have confirmed the authenticity of the notation based on the PTP1B inhibitory activity of farnesylated 2-arylbenzofurans. Specifically, two farnesylated 2-arylbenzofurans [morusalfurans B (2) and C (3)] showed strong inhibitory effects on PTP1B with IC(50) values of 8.92 and 7.26 µM, respectively, which was significantly higher than that of the positive controls [sodium orthovanadate (IC(50) = 15.10 µM) and ursolic acid (IC(50) = 11.34 µM)]. Besides, two 2-arylbenzofurans [morusalfurans A (1) and F (6)], one flavonoid [morusalnol B (9)], and one geranylated stilbene [morusibene A (11)] exhibited PTP1B inhibition with IC(50) values ranging from 11.02 to 26.56 µM. Kinetic studies revealed compounds 2, 3, 6, and 11 as mixed type PTP1B inhibitors, while 1 and 9 are known as noncompetitive. Molecular docking simulations demonstrated that these active compounds can bind with the respective catalytic or/and allosteric sites of PTP1B with negative binding energies and the results are in accordance with that of the kinetic studies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time, the PTP1B inhibitory activity of eleven compounds (1–11), as well as the mechanism of action underlying the effects on PTP1B enzyme of the active compounds, were investigated. In vitro and in silico results suggest that the farnesylated 2-arylbenzofurans from M. alba may potentially be utilized as an effective treatment therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus and its associated complications.","Ha, Manh Tuan; Shrestha, Srijan; Tran, Thu Huong; Kim, Jeong Ah; Woo, Mi Hee; Choi, Jae Sue; Min, Byung Sun",Arch Pharm Res,661,1

The widespread use of these OSNs has also led to the emergence of social bots. What is more, the existence of social bots is so powerful that some of them can turn into influential users. In this paper, we studied the automated construction technology and infiltration strategies of social bots in Sina Microblog, aiming at building friendly and influential social bots to resist malicious interpretations. Firstly, we studied the critical technology of Sina Microblog data collection, which indicates that the defense mechanism of that is vulnerable. Then, we constructed 96 social bots in Sina Microblog and researched the influence of different infiltration strategies, like different attribute settings and various types of interactions. Finally, our social bots gained 5546 followers in the 42-day infiltration period with a 100% survival rate. The results show that the infiltration strategies we proposed are effective and can help social bots escape detection of Sina Microblog defense mechanism as well. The study in this paper sounds an alarm for Sina Microblog defense mechanism and provides a valuable reference for social bots detection.","Wang, Wenxian; Chen, Xingshu; Jiang, Shuyu; Wang, Haizhou; Yin, Mingyong; Wang, Peiming",Sci Rep,661,16

We measured the seroprevalence of chikungunya, dengue and Zika and its associated factors in the population of Juazeiro do Norte, Southern Ceará State, Brazil. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of analytical and spatial analysis was performed to estimate the seroprevalence of dengue, Zika and chikungunya, in the year 2018. Participants were tested for IgM and IgG against these three viruses. Those with IgM and/or IgG positive tests results were considered positive. Poisson regression was used to analyze the factors associated with positive cases, in the same way that the spatial analysis of positive cases was performed to verify whether the cases were grouped. RESULTS: Of the 404 participants, 25.0% (103/404) were positive for CHIKV, 92.0% (373/404) for flavivirus (dengue or Zika) and of these, 37.9% (153/404) samples were classified as probable dengue infection. Of those who reported having had an arbovirus in the past, positive CHIKV cases had 58.7% arthralgia (PR = 4.31; 95% CI: 2.06–9.03; p = 0.000) mainly in the hands, ankles and feet. Age over 60 years had a positive association with cases of flavivirus (PR = 1.29; 95% CI: 1.09–1.54; p = 0.000). Fever, muscle pain, joint pain and skin rash were the most reported symptoms (46.1, 41.0, 38.3 and 28.41%, respectively). The positive cases of chikungunya and dengue or Zika were grouped in space and the city center was most affected area. CONCLUSIONS: Four years after the introduction of CHIKV, where DENV has been in circulation for over 30 years, 1/4 of the population has already been exposed, showing the extent of the epidemic. The measured prevalence was much higher than that reported by local epidemiological surveillance.","Barreto, Francisca Kalline de Almeida; Alencar, Carlos Henrique; Araújo, Fernanda Montenegro de Carvalho; Oliveira, Rhaquel de Morais Alves Barbosa; Cavalcante, John Washington; Lemos, Daniele Rocha Queiroz; Farias, Luís Arthur Brasil Gadelha; Boriz, Isac Lucca Frota; Medeiros, Leticia Queiroz; Melo, Marcelo Nunes Pereira; Miyajima, Fábio; Siqueira, André Machado; Freitas, André Ricardo Ribas; Cavalcanti, Luciano Pamplona de Góes",BMC Infect Dis,661,26

VINBLASTINE MONOTHERAPY INDUCTION FOR LOCALISED CNS GERMINOMA DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC,18.51715,3.6767879,2020-12-04,"The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the main basketball league around the globe with estimated revenue of approximately US$ 49.5 billion. A key change in NBA rules was the implementation of the three-point (3PT) line in the 1979–1980 season. Recently a popular conception claims that NBA is passing through a 3PT revolution; however, few works have discussed the evolution of shot patterns in the NBA. Thus, in this article NBA shot data per 100 possessions for each player from all seasons since implementation of the 3PT line were gathered to compare 2PT and 3PT shot statistics, aiming to understand how the shot pattern evolved throughout the NBA history. The results show that the main differences in shot patterns happened due to modifications in the 3PT line distance. The only exception was the statistically significant increase of 3PT attempts (3PTA) in the 1986–1987 season, a likely result of the success of the first 3PT contest in the previous season, which probably led most players to attempt this kind of shot. Also, the results did not show any season-by-season statistically significant change in shot patterns after the 3PT line distance was returned to its original distance in the 1997–1998 season. Thus, the actual popularity and numbers of 3PTA gradually increased throughout the seasons.

We adopt a similar approach to Kilian (Am Econ Rev 99(3):1053–1069, 2009) and construct a structural vector autoregression framework to decompose crude oil price shocks into oil supply shock, oil aggregate demand shock, and oil-specific demand shock. We then explore the distinct effects of different kinds of oil price shocks from various sources. Based on the decomposed oil price shocks, we apply the connectedness approach and QQ regression to find time-varying co-movements and tail dependence between oil price shocks and G7 stock returns. There is no general correlation between the decomposed oil prices and stock returns in these countries. The effects of oil price shocks on stock returns across different stock market conditions appear to be heterogeneous. Oil supply shock appears to be a net transmitter of spillover effects for all G7 countries within the sample period.","Jiang, Yonghong; Tian, Gengyu; Mo, Bin",Financ Innov,661,16

This fruitful research, however, has not been well tied to fruit flies’ natural history. To address this knowledge gap, I conducted a field study. My goal was to inform future research conducted in artificial surroundings, and to inspire new investigations that can rely more heavily on fruit flies’ actual natural behavior. My two main novel findings were first, that flies in the field showed significant sociability, as they formed social groups rather than dispersed randomly among fruits of similar quality. Second, males showed fair levels of aggression towards each other as indicated by a lunging rate of 17 per hour, and lower rates of wing threat and boxing. Courtship was the most prominent activity on fruits, with females rejecting almost all males’ advances. This resulted in an estimated mating rate of 0.6 per female per day. Flies showed a striking peak of activity early in the mornings, even at cold temperatures, followed by inactivity for much of the day and night. Flies, however, handled well high temperatures approaching 40 °C by hiding away from fruit and concentrating activity in the cooler, early mornings. My field work highlights a few promising lines of future research informed by fruit flies’ natural history. Most importantly, we do not understand the intriguing dynamics that generate significant sociability despite frequent aggressive interactions on fruits. Males’ responses to female rejection signals varied widely, perhaps because the signals differed in information content perceived by flies but not humans. Finally, flies tolerated cold early mornings perhaps owing to fitness benefits associated with increased mating and feeding opportunities at this time. Flies were adept at handling very high temperatures under the natural daily temperature fluctuations and availability of shelters, and this can inform more realistic research on the effects of global warming on animals in their natural settings.","Dukas, Reuven",Sci Rep,661,16

This study aimed to assess how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted these CG-related risk factors for EM in a community sample of CGs. A non-probability sample of 433 CGs caring for adult CRs age ≥60 years with physical (76%), cognitive (34%) and mental health (14%) conditions completed a survey on COVID-19 impacts in April-May 2020. CGs had mean age 61 (range 21 – 91), were 75% female and 92% non-Hispanic White. Over 40% of CGs reported doing worse financially since COVID-19. Compared to before COVID-19, 15% reported drinking more alcohol and 64% reported somewhat or greatly increased feelings of social isolation and loneliness. CGs reported that COVID-19 had made caregiving more physically (18.7%), emotionally (48.5%) and financially (14.5%) difficult, interfered with their own healthcare (19%), and led to family conflict over caring for CR (13.2%). Younger CGs (age <65) and those with annual income <$50,000 were more likely to report negative COVID-19 impacts. This study suggests CGs of older adults may be experiencing increased stress, alcohol use, social isolation and negative impacts on their own health and financial situation. Healthcare and social service providers should assess for these EM risk-factors in caregivers and connect them and their care recipients with resources and services to address these stressors to reduce risk of EM during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Makaroun, Lena; Beach, Scott; Rosen, Tony; Rosland, Ann-Marie",Innov Aging,661,17

Hospital systems and medical practices have evolved to protect patients, physicians, and staff and conserve personal protective equipment and resources. Orthopaedic practices have been specifically affected by social distancing and stay at home guidelines, limiting in-office practice and elective surgery restrictions. This, in turn, has had an effect on resident education. Previous literature has been published regarding how academic programs have adjusted to these changes. However, the effects on smaller orthopaedic residencies with nonacademic faculty has not been discussed. The orthopaedic residency at Baylor University Medical Center of Dallas is a fifteen-resident program with a combination of hospital employed and private practice faculty. We adjusted our resident education in mid-March 2020 to keep residents safe while trying to maximize surgical and clinical education and outside research. GOALS: Our goals were to come up with a plan allowed for continuing high-level patient care and resident education while protecting residents and limiting burnout. MODEL: We devised a four-team system with five-day call periods. Interactions between teams were strictly minimized. We also moved to a web-based academic curriculum and devised a system for safe resident participation in surgical cases. The model has been adjusted based on attending and resident feedback. CONCLUSION: Until we develop effective treatments or vaccination for COVID-19, there is a possibility that it will be an ongoing threat. Resident education must also adapt to the changing environment while continuing to provide residents safe opportunities for patient care, didactic education, and research. We believe we have come up with a sustainable, adaptable model for resident education during this challenging time.","Oguayo, Chris C.; Chu, Jennifer; Jones, Alan L.",J Am Acad Orthop Surg Glob Res Rev,661,16

The global debate regarding religious education in government schools has stimulated discussion in Australia around the merit of SRE and its place in contemporary Australian society. Providing SRE classes and their diverse religious backgrounds allows for a more intentional teaching and learning approach to fostering spirituality, religious belief and religious values. Values education is perceived as a pivotal means of ensuring the continuity of a society’s values (Dror “National Education” through mutually supportive educational devices: a case study of Zionist education. Peter Lang, New York, 2007). From the perspective of many educators, values education is at the heart of educational effort, going beyond technically transferring skills. Yet, on the other hand, some argue that values education is liable to result in political, religious or ideological indoctrination. This chapter will define the meaning of values education and discuss the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic values. It will outline the national framework for values education developed by the Australian government. This chapter will then analyse how SRE contributes to the Australian values framework. Research has shown that belief in a higher being, a key element in SRE, can contribute significantly to values education. This research will be examined, as well as responses from SRE educators across the states and territories, who have been interviewed through a qualitative research project.","Gross, Zehavit; Rutland, Suzanne D.",Special Religious Education in Australia and its Value to Contemporary Society,661,24

Deciding whether a given language [Formula: see text] can be expressed by an automaton of a desired class can be reduced to deciding a game between Prover and Refuter: in each turn of the game, Refuter provides a letter in [Formula: see text] , and Prover responds with an annotation of the current state of the run (for example, in the case of Büchi automata, whether the state is accepting or rejecting, and in the case of parity automata, what the color of the state is). Prover wins if the sequence of annotations she generates is correct: it is an accepting run iff the word generated by Refuter is in L. We show how a winning strategy for Refuter can serve as a simple and easy-to-understand certificate to inexpressibility, and how it induces additional forms of certificates. Our framework handles all classes of deterministic automata, including ones with structural restrictions like weak automata. In addition, it can be used for refuting separation of two languages by an automaton of the desired class, and for finding automata that approximate L and belong to the desired class.","Kupferman, Orna; Sickert, Salomon",Foundations of Software Science and Computation Structures,661,1

This phenomenon has not been well established during this SARS CoV2 pandemic. In this case series, we aim to evaluate patients admitted to our facility with new onset DM who had a history of COVID-19 infection. Method: This was a single center case series that included adult patients who presented to our facility with new onset DM during June-October 2020 who had a history of SARS CoV2 positive PCR and/or positive IgG antibody to SARS CoV2. Pregnant patients were excluded. Data was collected from the hospital electronic medical records. Diagnosis of diabetes was determined in these patients via hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) level greater than 6.5%. Results: Six patients fulfilled our diagnostic criteria. All patients were male with a median age of 54 years. The median BMI is 33.9, with 5 patients considered to be obese and 1 overweight. Other than the increased BMI, 2 patients with pre-DM and 3 patients who had a family history of DM, no other identifiable risk factors for DM were noted in this cohort. Five patients required hospitalization for HHS or DKA and 1 patient was managed as an outpatient. Median random serum glucose on presentation was 761.5 mg/dl and median HbA1C on presentation was 11.5%. Significant dosages of parenteral insulin (0.45 U/Kg) was required for hospitalized patients during their inpatient stay along with immediately after discharge to control their hyperglycemia. Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase and Islet Cell antibodies were done for 2 of the patients and were negative. Three of the patients who had follow up in 2 months showed improvement in their HbA1C (median of 7.1% [5.4–10.7]) and considerably diminished subcutaneous insulin requirement (0.2U/Kg). Two of these patients continued to follow up, and at 4 months from onset of DM, median HbA1C was 5.85% with insulin ceased. Of note, the patient who was lost to follow up was found to have an HbA1C improvement from 11.4% to 5.4% at the 2 month mark. Discussion: Both SARS CoV1 and SARS CoV2 activates the RAAS, causing insulin resistance by altering insulin signaling and increasing oxidative stress leading to dysfunction of pancreatic beta calls. The inflammatory cytokine storm response seen in COVID-19 can also decrease skeletal muscle sensitivity to insulin and decrease peripheral glucose uptake. These mechanisms may be leading to the new-onset DM noticed in our COVID-19 patients. In addition, there may be a possible immune-mediated mechanism given the matched time line between the COVID-19 antibody life span and the duration of DM. It is unknown whether this effect is permanent or temporary, although our results do support the latter. More studies that utilize a larger cohort and longer follow up are needed in order to get a better understanding of the mechanism of DM in COVID-19 infection.","Saleem, Marwa; Zahra, Tasneem; Menon, Vidya; Vargas-Jerez, Julia; Sarwal, Amara",J Endocr Soc,661,31

OBJECTIVE: An on-site wellness program for physicians-in-training and faculty was assessed by examining (a) were participants representative of those eligible for services and (b) demographic and trainee vs. faculty differences in burnout, distress, suicide risk, and presenting concerns of participants who utilized services. METHODS: From 2013–2018, 73% (N = 468; 316 residents/fellows, 152 faculty) of individuals seeking services also consented to research. At intake, participants completed a distress measure (ACORN) and two items from the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), and clinicians categorized presenting concerns and suicide risk. Using Chi-square analyses, participants’ characteristics were compared to physicians eligible for treatment. The association between demographics, faculty vs. trainee status, specialty, and distress, burnout, suicide risk, and presenting concerns was evaluated with ANOVAs and logistic regressions. RESULTS: Women, trainees, and primary care physicians were more likely to access services. On the ACORN, 63% were in the clinical range (M =1.7, SD =0.6). On the MBI, 36% scored in the clinical range. Clinicians rated 9% of participants with suicide risk. Neither gender, racial/ethnic minority status, nor specialty were associated with distress, burnout or suicide risk. Trainees reported greater distress than faculty (F (1,447) = 8.42, P = .004, [Formula: see text] = .018). Participants reported multiple presenting concerns (M = 3.0, SD = 1.18) with faculty more commonly endorsing work-related issues. Trainees more commonly reported new or worsening psychological symptoms, performance and family concerns. CONCLUSIONS: Two physician groups which often report higher levels of burnout and distress when surveyed, women physicians and residents/fellows, were the most likely to get professional help in an on-site wellness program. Physician wellness programs need to be prepared to address work and personal stressors and different levels of distress and risk.","Ey, PhD, Sydney; Ladd, PhD, Benjamin; Soller, MD, Marie; Moffit, PhD, Mary",Glob Adv Health Med,661,16

The globalization of markets and the migration phenomenon contributed to the modification of food preferences of consumers who gradually introduce into their eating habits foods and recipes typical of the tradition of foreign countries. In this scenario, also in Italy, it is going to increase the use of “foreign products” with the consequent fusion of traditional cuisine techniques and recipes with ingredients that are typical of foreign countries and cultures. Foods and ingredients originally consumed in Asian or South American countries are increasingly consumed by Italian people, who have notoriously a strong “food identity,” who generally follow the Mediterranean Diet, and who consume typical products of the country. More particularly, the use of “new” or “novel” spices compared to those traditionally used in the preparation of Italian food has grown in the last 10 years. This study is an exploratory survey on the consumption of spices in Sicily (Southern Italy), which is an Italian Region with a high level of immigrated people and a good level of social integration and progressive inclusion. The objective of this study is to know whether and how Sicilian consumers’ consumption preferences, use, and purchasing behaviors with regard to spices changed in the last few years. The results highlight an increasing use of novel spices for the preparation of the traditional recipes and a good appreciation by consumers. These results are interesting because they provide information about spices’ market development and food product marketing and internationalization. The survey gives interesting inputs for reflections about the relationship between food contaminations and social integration and insight into consumers’ preferences in Italy.","Chironi, Stefania; Bacarella, Simona; Altamore, Luca; Columba, Pietro; Ingrassia, Marzia",J,661,24

METHODS: Individuals aged 18 years and older, diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (DM), and attended an ambulatory DM clinic formed the sample frame. They were invited to complete an electronic musculoskeletal (MSK) conditions and symptoms questionnaire booklet using a secured electronic email system. Individuals whose secured email box was not active at the time were discarded. Using the Central Person Registry number, a unique number assigned to all Danish residents, we linked the sample frame to different registries to learn more about non-responders. Non-responders were either individuals who did not respond to a single question and those who responded “No” to the first question about willing to participate. We calculated descriptive statistics for each characteristic. Univariate logistic regression models were conducted to determine the relationship between each characteristic and non-responder status. RESULTS: The response rate was 36% (n = 3812). Individuals with type 2 DM (OR 2.0 (95% CI 1.8–2.2)), secondary DM (1.9 (1.3–2.8)) or unspecified DM (2.1 (1.8–2.4)) were more likely to be non-responders than individuals with Type 1 DM. Also, individuals aged 70–79 (1.3 (1.1–1.6)) and 80 years and older (5.9 (4.5–7.7)) were more likely to be non-responders than 18–29 years old individuals. However, individuals aged 40–49 (1.5 (1.2–1.8)), 50–59 (1.5 (1.3–1.8)) or 60–69 (1.4 (1.1–1.6)) were more likely to be responders than 18–29 years old individuals. Individuals with Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) of 1 (2.0 (1.3.2.9) or CCI of 2 (1.7 (1.1–2.5) were more likely to be responders than individuals with a CCI of 0. Lastly, individuals who were currently outside of the workforce (1.6 (2.4–2.9) or had unknown/missing socioeconomic status (3.9 (2.8–5.3) were more likely to be non-responders than individuals who were working. CONCLUSION: Although we did find a non-response bias, this cohort will be an important source to determine the prevalence and consequences of MSK conditions in a secondary care DM population.","Boyle, Eleanor; Folkestad, Lars; Frafjord, Erik; Koes, Bart W; Skou, Soren Thorgaard; Hartvigsen, Jan",Clin Epidemiol,661,17

This paper proposes a novel stacked ensemble to detect COVID-19 either from chest CT scans or chest x-ray images of an individual. The proposed model is a stacked ensemble of heterogenous pre-trained computer vision models. Four pre-trained DL models were considered: Visual Geometry Group (VGG 19), Residual Network (ResNet 101), Densely Connected Convolutional Networks (DenseNet 169) and Wide Residual Network (WideResNet 50 2). From each pre-trained model, the potential candidates for base classifiers were obtained by varying the number of additional fully-connected layers. After an exhaustive search, three best-performing diverse models were selected to design a weighted average-based heterogeneous stacked ensemble. Five different chest CT scans and chest x-ray images were used to train and evaluate the proposed model. The performance of the proposed model was compared with two other ensemble models, baseline pre-trained computer vision models and existing models for COVID-19 detection. The proposed model achieved uniformly good performance on five different datasets, consisting of chest CT scans and chest x-rays images. In relevance to COVID-19, as the recall is more important than precision, the trade-offs between recall and precision at different thresholds were explored. Recommended threshold values which yielded a high recall and accuracy were obtained for each dataset.","Jangam, Ebenezer; Barreto, Aaron Antonio Dias; Annavarapu, Chandra Sekhara Rao",Appl Intell,661,10

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients with diffuse midline gliomas, including 16 with the H3 K27M mutant and 14 with wild type tumors, were retrospectively included in this study. A total of 272 radiomic features were initially extracted from MR images of each tumor. Principal component analysis, univariate analysis, and three other feature selection methods, including variance thresholding, recursive feature elimination, and the elastic net, were used to analyze the radiomic features. Based on the results, related visually accessible features of the tumors were further evaluated. RESULTS: Patients with DMG-M were younger than those with diffuse midline gliomas with H3 K27M wild (DMG-W) (median, 25.5 and 48 years old, respectively; p=0.005). Principal component analysis showed that there were obvious overlaps in the first two principal components for both DMG-M and DMG-W tumors. The feature selection results showed that few features from T2-weighted images (T2WI) were useful for differentiating DMG-M and DMG-W tumors. Thereafter, four visually accessible features related to T2WI were further extracted and analyzed. Among these features, only cystic formation showed a significant difference between the two types of tumors (OR=7.800, 95% CI 1.476–41.214, p=0.024). CONCLUSIONS: DMGs with and without the H3 K27M mutation shared similar MRI characteristics. T2W sequences may be valuable, and cystic formation a useful MRI biomarker, for diagnosing brain DMG-M.","Li, Qian; Dong, Fei; Jiang, Biao; Zhang, Minming",Front Oncol,661,29

Two core elements of patients’ rights are the rights to be treated in a dignified manner and to give feedback about services. Psychiatric patients may feel treated in an undignified manner, especially during involuntary hospital admissions. AIM: We explored the relationship between Mental Health Care Act 17 of 2002 (MHCA) status and dignity-related complaints. SETTING: The study was conducted at a specialist state psychiatric hospital. METHODS: We reviewed 120 registered complaints by psychiatric inpatients, retrieved the clinical files, and analysed 70 complaints. Fisher’s exact tests described the relationship between patients’ MHCA status and the frequency of dignity-related or other categories of complaints. Logistic regression analyses were adjusted for potential covariates. RESULTS: Most complaints were from single, literate male patients, aged 30–39 years, with mood disorders. Most complainants were admitted involuntarily (60%). Dignity-related complaints (n = 41; 58%) outnumbered nondignity-related complaints (n = 29; 41%). The proportion of dignity-related complaints was higher in involuntary (64%) and assisted (60%) patients than in voluntary patients (44%). Dignity-related complaints were not significantly associated with MHCA status (χ(2) = 2.03 and p = 0.36). Involuntary patients were more than twice as likely as assisted and voluntary patients to complain about dignity-related matters (Odds ratio [OR]: 2.25; 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.71; 7.13]; p = 0.16). CONCLUSION: Involuntary patients are more likely to complain about dignity-related matters.

Imaging is vital in planning further management. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to describe the common intracranial masses and their imaging characteristics in the paediatric population referred to Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital for MRI of the brain. METHOD: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of paediatric patients (aged from birth to 18 years) who underwent MRI investigations for intracranial masses between January 2010 and December 2016. RESULTS: A total of 931 MRI brain scans were performed. One hundred and seven scans met the inclusion criteria, of which 92 were primary brain tumours and 15 were inflammatory masses. The majority were females (56%). The mean age was 12 ± 4.52 (range of 3–18 years). The most common presenting symptom was seizures (70/107, 65.4%). We categorised the masses according to supra- and infratentorial compartments. The most common site for masses was the supratentorial compartment (n = 56, 52%). The most common masses in the supratentorial compartment were craniopharyngiomas (14/45, 31.1%), whilst in the infratentorial compartment, the most common masses were medulloblastomas (24/47, 51.1%). CONCLUSION: In our series, the supratentorial compartment was the commonest site for intracranial masses. The most common tumour in the infratentorial compartment was medulloblastoma.

These systems have been implemented in more than 80 laboratories to date and capture all test results produced from these laboratories, including HIV viral load (VL) testing. In 2018 the national HIV programme in Côte d’Ivoire requested international support to develop real-time tools such as dashboards to aggregate and display test-specific data such as HIV VL testing to support the country’s programmatic response to HIV. INTERVENTION: The VL dashboard was adapted in 2018 using source software code obtained from the Kenyan Ministry of Health and modified for the Ivorian context. The dashboard enables users to assess relevant clinical data from all Ivoirians living with HIV who undergo VL testing through dashboard data visualisations, including the number of VL tests, kinds of samples tested, and VL levels stratified by demographics and geographic location. LESSONS LEARNT: The VL dashboard enables rapid analysis of VL testing data from across the country and enables the national HIV programme, donors and partners to respond rapidly to issues pertaining to access, turn-around times and others.

Meeting these responsibilities is critical in the field of global health, where study abroad programs are often designed to provide healthcare services in under-resourced communities. Leaders in global health have thus formed working groups to study the ethical implications of overseas programming and have led the way in establishing socially responsible best practices for study abroad. Their recommendations include development of bidirectional programming that is designed for mutual and equitable benefits, focused on locally identified needs and priorities, attentive to local community costs, and structured to build local capacity to ensure sustainability. Implementation remains a key challenge, however. Sustainable, bidirectional programming is difficult and costly. In the present study, authors questioned how technology could be used to connect students of global health in distant countries to make socially responsible global health programming more accessible. Drawing on empirical research in the learning sciences and leveraging best practices in technology design, the authors developed a Virtual Exchange in Global Health to connect university students in the U.S. with counterparts in Lebanon, who worked in teams to address humanitarian problems in Syrian refugee camps. Early results demonstrate the value of this approach. At dramatically lower cost than traditional study abroad—and with essentially no carbon footprint—students recognized complementary strengths in each other through bidirectional programming, learned about local needs and priorities through Virtual Reality, and built sustaining relationships while addressing a difficult real-world problem. The authors learned that technology could effectively facilitate socially responsible global health programming and do so at low cost.

Newborns are relatively deficient in ADA1 resulting in elevated plasma adenosine concentrations and a Th2/anti-inflammatory bias compared to adults. Despite the growing recognition of the role of ADAs in immune regulation, little is known about the ontogeny of ADA concentrations. METHODS: In a subgroup of the EPIC002-study, clinical data and plasma samples were collected from 540 Gambian infants at four time-points: day of birth; first week of life; one month of age; and four months of age. Concentrations of total extracellular ADA, ADA1, and ADA2 were measured by chromogenic assay and evaluated in relation to clinical data. Plasma cytokines/chemokine were measured across the first week of life and correlated to ADA concentrations. RESULTS: ADA2 demonstrated a steady rise across the first months of life, while ADA1 concentration significantly decreased 0.79-fold across the first week then increased 1.4-fold by four months of life. Males demonstrated significantly higher concentrations of ADA2 (1.1-fold) than females at four months; newborns with early-term (37 to <39 weeks) and late-term (≥41 weeks) gestational age demonstrated significantly higher ADA1 at birth (1.1-fold), and those born to mothers with advanced maternal age (≥35 years) had lower plasma concentrations of ADA2 at one month (0.93-fold). Plasma ADA1 concentrations were positively correlated with plasma CXCL8 during the first week of life, while ADA2 concentrations correlated positively with TNFα, IFNγ and CXCL10, and negatively with IL-6 and CXCL8. CONCLUSIONS: The ratio of plasma ADA2/ADA1 concentration increased during the first week of life, after which both ADA1 and ADA2 increased across the first four months of life suggesting a gradual development of Th1/Th2 balanced immunity. Furthermore, ADA1 and ADA2 were positively correlated with cytokines/chemokines during the first week of life. Overall, ADA isoforms demonstrate robust ontogeny in newborns and infants but further mechanistic studies are needed to clarify their roles in early life immune development and the correlations with sex, gestational age, and maternal age that were observed.","Odumade, Oludare A.; Plotkin, Alec L.; Pak, Jensen; Idoko, Olubukola T.; Pettengill, Matthew A.; Kollmann, Tobias R.; Ozonoff, Al; Kampmann, Beate; Levy, Ofer; Smolen, Kinga K.",Front Immunol,661,1

This study seeks to bridge this gap by adapting the theory of attribution framework to examine the effects of personal norms, social norms, perceived behavioral control on pro-environmental behavior of smartphone usage in children. METHODS: A total of 225 children aged between 11 to 12 from eight selected public primary schools at the Hsinchu Science and Industrial Park in Taiwan were surveyed. Two distinct groups (excessive versus moderate usage) were purposefully selected for comparison, of which 96 participants were excessive smartphone users while the remaining 129 were moderate smartphone users. RESULTS: Findings revealed significant differences between excessive and moderate smartphone usage children groups in personal norms (p < 0.001), social norms (p = 0.002), perceived behavioral control (p = 0.001), and pro-environmental behavior (p = 0.001). Findings for excessive smartphone usage children showed that social norms (β = 0.428, t = 4.096***, p < 0.001) had a direct predictive impact on pro-environmental behavior. In contrast, while there was no direct path established between personal norms and pro-environmental behavior (β = 0.177, t = 1.580, p > 0.05), as well as social norms and pro-environmental behavior for moderate smartphone usage children (β = 0.181, t = 1.924, p > 0.05), but such a relationship could be developed through the mediating effect of perceived behavioral control (β = 0.497, t = 4.471***, p < 0.001). DISCUSSION: The results suggested that excessive smartphone usage children lack positive perceived behavioral control, and their pro-environmental behavior could only be predicted through explicit social norms, whereas pro-environmental behavior of moderate smartphone usage children was implicitly influenced by personal norms through perceived behavioral control.","Fang, Wei-Ta; Ng, Eric; Liu, Shu-Mei; Chiang, Yi-Te; Chang, Mei-Chuan",PeerJ,661,1

RESULTS: Only 19 patients (4.8%) were UAE nationals, while 372 (95.2%) were expatriates. Median age was 48 (interquartile range, 40–56) years; 22% were <40 years, and only 16.6% were female. Cough was the most common symptom (78.7%), fever was 77.4%, and gastrointestinal symptoms were least common (13.8%). Approximately 95% had elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and D-dimers (79%), lymphocytopenia 47.3%, and thrombocytopenia 13.8%. Mortality was 30% for the total sample and 50% in ICU patients. ICU patients were older than non-ICU (age; 49.6 ± 10.9 vs. 46.7 ± 12.7 years, p = 0.04). Eighty-five percent of ICU patients required invasive mechanical ventilation, 78% vasopressors, 88% sedation, 84% muscle paralysis, while none require any of these in the medical group. Survivors had fewer patients with sedatives (p = 0.01). The median length of stay in the hospital was 19 days, ICU stays 14 days, and ventilator 11 days. The Mann-Whitney test showed that survivors spent more days in the ICU (median [IQR] 18 [6.5–29.5] vs. 11 [4–18], p value 0.003) and the hospital (32 [14.5–49.5] vs. 14 [7–21], p value 0.001) than nonsurvivors.

The gender perspective is relevant to understand the challenges faced by men and women in the fishing sector. Galicia (Spain) is one of the main fishing regions in the EU and with the largest number of women working in the fishing sector, especially in shellfishing on foot. Shellfishing on foot, an artisanal and traditional activity for the cultivation and extraction of mainly bivalve molluscs, represents 7% of gross value added (GVA) and 17% of the employment of the Galician fishing sector as a whole. Since the 1960s, a process of regulation and modernization of shellfishing on foot—more than 95% of which is carried out by women—has led to a sharp decrease in the number of shellfish gatherers. The regulatory processes and the professionalization of the sector have resulted in a strong decline in female employment, but, at the same time, women feel empowered and regard their jobs as dignified work. Our objective—through the analysis of the local permits granted to carry out this activity—focuses on the study of the consolidation of this process and has tried to highlight the ways in which patriarchy perpetuates the hegemonic position of men evidenced, for example, by a progressive masculinization of this activity with increasing economic profitability and social prestige.","de los Ángeles Piñeiro-Antelo, María; Santos, Xosé M",Maritime Studies,661,19

With vitamins and supplements being readily accessible, many have turned to using them in an effort to combat the virus. The purpose of this review was to analyse clinical trials regarding vitamins and supplements for the treatment of COVID-19 infections. METHODS: Articles were identified through a literature search utilizing online databases and bibliographic review. RESULTS: A total of seven articles were identified for review. All articles evaluated the use of vitamins and supplements for the treatment of COVID-19. Drug therapies included oral vitamin D, intravenous and oral vitamin C, oral vitamin D/magnesium/vitamin B12, oral zinc, oral combination zinc/ascorbic acid, and intravenous alpha-lipoic acid. The end points of each study varied, including the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, mortality, rate of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, negativity of COVID-19 tests, oxygen requirements, and symptom burden. CONCLUSION: Of the vitamins and supplements that were studied, vitamin D presented the most promising data demonstrating significant decreases in oxygen requirements, need for ICU treatment, SARS-CoV-2 RNA test positivity, and mortality. All of these benefits were exhibited in hospitalized patients. Other vitamins and supplements that were evaluated in studies did not demonstrate any statistically significant benefits. Common shortcomings of the articles included generally small sample sizes, varying sites of study (which could determine the virus variant), a lack of standard of care as background therapy, and utilization of doses that were higher than standard.","Speakman, Lauren L; Michienzi, Sarah M; Badowski, Melissa E",Drugs Context,661,1

In this study the performance of the new assay was evaluated for use on a portable screening device (ParaDNA), with the long-term goal to enable rollout at POC as an inventive step to meet the World Health Organization’s sustainable development goals for Africa. DNA samples for germline testing were obtained retrospectively from 50 patients with early-stage hormone receptor-positive breast cancer referred for genomic tumor profiling (MammaPrint). Currently, SA patients with the luminal-type breast cancer are not routinely selected for BRCA1/2 testing as is the case for triple-negative disease. An initial evaluation involved the use of multiple control samples representing each of the pathogenic founder/recurrent variants included in the BRCA 1.0 POC Research Assay. Comparison with a validated laboratory-based first-tier real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay demonstrated 100% concordance. Clinical utility was evident in five patients with the founder BRCA2 c.7934delG variant, identified at the 10% (5/50) threshold considered cost-effective for BRCA1/2 testing. BRCA2 c.7934delG carrier status was associated with a significantly younger age (p=0.03) at diagnosis of breast cancer compared to non-carriers. In three of the BRCA2 c.7934delG carriers a high-risk MammaPrint 70-gene profile was noted, indicating a significantly increased risk for both secondary cancers and breast cancer recurrence. Initiating germline DNA testing at the POC for clinical interpretation early in the treatment planning process, will increase access to the most common pathogenic BRCA1/2 variants identified in SA and reduce loss to follow-up for timely gene-targeted risk reduction intervention. The ease of using cheek swabs/saliva in future for result generation within approximately one hour assay time, coupled with low cost and a high BRCA1/2 founder variant detection rate, will improve access to genomic medicine in Africa. Application of translational pharmacogenomics across ethnic groups, irrespective of age, family history, tumor subtype or recurrence risk profile, is imperative to sustainably implement preventative healthcare and improve clinical outcome in resource-constrained clinical settings.","Mampunye, Lwando; van der Merwe, Nerina C.; Grant, Kathleen A.; Peeters, Armand V.; Torrorey-Sawe, Rispah; French, David J.; Moremi, Kelebogile E.; Kidd, Martin; van Eeden, Petrus C.; Pienaar, Fredrieka M.; Kotze, Maritha J.",Front Oncol,661,33

Assessment for Learning (AfL), an assessment and pedagogic innovation, if done well, can fully engage students in the learning and assessment process. Adopting a multi-case design, the present study explored how Chinese university English as a Foreign Language (EFL) teachers used AfL to facilitate student engagement in their classrooms and what factors influenced their AfL practices. Three EFL teachers were recruited on a voluntary basis from two universities in Northwest China. Data collected from semi-structed interviews, stimulated recall interviews, and classroom observations suggested that teacher participants demonstrated differed assessment practices, representing Assessment of Learning (AoL), convergent, and divergent AfL, respectively. Three factors: teacher assessment literacy, teachers' beliefs about the relationship between goal orientation and motivation, as well as a trusting relationship between teachers and students, were identified as contributing to teachers' different assessment practices. Our study calls for teacher educators' efforts to equip teachers with necessary assessment-related knowledge and skills, encourage teachers to negotiate learning goals with students, and help teachers establish a trusting environment in their classrooms, if AfL is to be fully embedded in classroom instruction.","Wu, Xiaoming (Molly); Zhang, Lawrence Jun; Liu, Qian",Front Psychol,661,1

METHODS A cross-sectional study was designed to investigate 474 nursing students by cluster sampling using a stratified questionnaire from February 15 to March 31, 2020. Multiple linear regression was used to identify the factors affecting professional identity. Binary and multiple logistic regression were used to identify the factors affecting anxiety. RESULTS Responders with a high level of understanding of COVID-19 and frequent use of behavioral strategies for its prevention comprised 93.2% and 30.0% of the cohort, respectively. Professional identity was significantly associated with gender and anxiety (p < .050). The prevalence of anxiety among nursing students was 12.4%. Male (odds ratio [OR] = 2.39; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.26~4.52), sophomores (OR = 5.30; 95% CI = 1.61~7.45), and infrequent use of prevention measures (OR = 3.49; 95% CI = 1.16~5.19) had a significant effect on anxiety. CONCLUSION Anxiety during the COVID-19 epidemic gives an adverse effect on the professional identity of nursing in students.

RESULTS Magnetic navigation tracheal intubation can successfully implement tracheal intubation, and the time required is lower than that of traditional laryngoscopy. CONCLUSIONS The tracheal intubation based on magnetic navigation technology is feasible, with high efficiency and easy operation. That is expected to be widely used for tracheal intubation during treatment of patients outside the hospital in the future. At the same time, magnetic navigation endotracheal intubation technology will be the key technology for the development of endotracheal intubation robots.","Wang, Rongfeng; Zhang, Qianyun; Ding, Hongfan; Zhu, Haoyang; Liu, Chang; Guan, Zheng; Zhao, Ge; Wang, Qiang; Lyu, Yi",Zhongguo yi liao qi xie za zhi = Chinese journal of medical instrumentation,661,1

Primary outcomes were cardiopulmonary bypass time (CPB), cross-clamp time (CX) and occurrence of postoperative cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs). Secondary outcomes were other perioperative parameters and complications. METHODS We retrospectively analysed 340 consecutive patients who underwent MIMVS for mitral regurgitation (MR), mitral stenosis or combined regurgitation/stenosis between November 2010 and March 2014 in a single referral centre. In total, 221 patients who underwent an isolated mitral valve repair or isolated mitral valve replacement or repair/replacement combined with an atrial fibrillation (AF)-ablation procedure were included. Patients who had previous cardiac surgery or concomitant tricuspid valve surgery, myxoma or atrial septal defect closure surgery were excluded. RESULTS A total of 57 patients (Group A) underwent MIMVS using the EAC and 164 patients (Group B) were operated using an EAB. Preoperative variables showed a significant difference in poor left ventricular function (LVF, P = 0.18) and moderate LVF (P = 0.019). No significant differences were found in CPB-time, cross-clamp time or postoperative CVA. Furthermore, no significant differences were found in complications, 30-day mortality or postoperative echocardiographical MR gradation. Hospital stay, however, was prolonged in Group A (P = 0.001) and maximum troponin T levels were significantly lower in Group B (P = 0.014). In Group B however, 10 procedures were converted (6%) from EAB to EAC. CONCLUSIONS There is no difference in use between the EAB and the EAC in terms of CPB-time and cross-clamp time, complications or MR gradation at discharge. Use of the EAC showed significantly higher postoperative levels of troponin T, implying more myocardial damage, compared with the EAB. In 6% of the cases however, patients were converted from the EAB to the EAC.","Bentala, Mohamed; Heuts, Samuel; Vos, Rein; Maessen, Jos; Scohy, Thierry V; Gerritse, Bastiaan M; Sardari Nia, Peyman",Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery,661,1

A multidisciplinary team-based strategy is necessary to adapt guidelines and medical practices to the actual situation. The aim of this study is to evaluate the changes in the therapeutic algorithm in a small group of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) enlisted for surgery during the COVID-19 outbreak. Materials and Methods: A multidisciplinary strategy has been adopted to allocate HCC patients to a treatment that permitted to reduce the risk of complications and the hospital stay, thus preventing contamination by the virus. Nasopharyngeal swab and a chest radiograph were performed in all patients within 48 hours before the surgical procedure: in the suspected cases with negative COVID tests, we prudently postponed surgery and repeated the diagnostic tests after 15 days. Results: During the emergency state, 11 HCC patients were treated (8 laparoscopic ablations and 3 hepatic resections). We reported only 1 postoperative complication (hemothorax) and 1 death during the follow-up for COVID pneumonia. Comparing our performances with those in the same time frame in the past 4 years, we treated a similar number of HCC patients, obtaining a decrease in operative timing (P = .0409) and hospital stay (P = .0412) (Fig. 2b) with similar rates of immediate postoperative complications, without ICU admissions. [Figure: see text] Conclusions: An adapted algorithm for the treatment of HCC to COVID outbreak permitted to manage safely these patients by identifying those most at risk of evolution of the neoplastic disease.","Santambrogio, Roberto; Farina, Gabriella; D'Alessandro, Valentina; Iacob, Giulio; Gemma, Marco; Zappa, Marco Antonio",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

This study used data from the 2019 National Nursing Home Social Services Directors survey (n = 924). One-fifth (19.7%) of SSDs reported a lack of self-efficacy in suicide risk management, as indicated by either needing significant preparation time or being unable to train others on intervening with residents at risk for suicide. Ordinal logistic regression identified SSDs who were master's prepared, reported insufficient social service staffing as a minor barrier (versus a major barrier) to psychosocial care, and those most involved in safety planning for suicide risk were more likely to report self-efficacy for training others. Implications include the need for targeted training of NH social service staff on suicide prevention, such as safety planning as an evidence-based practice. Likewise, sufficient staffing of qualified NH social service providers is critically important given the acute and chronic mental health needs of NH residents.","Wang, Xiaochuan; Simons, Kelsey; Gammonley, Denise; Roberts, Amy Restorick; Bern-Klug, Mercedes",Journal of gerontological social work,661,16

The COVID-19 virus directly targets the lungs, leading to pneumonia-like symptoms and shortness of breath with life-threatening consequences. Despite the fact that self-quarantine and social distancing are indispensable during the pandemic, the procedure for testing COVID-19 contraction is conventionally available through nasal swabs, saliva test kits, and blood work at healthcare settings. Therefore, devising personalized self-testing kits for COVID-19 virus and other similar viruses is heavily admired. Many e-health initiatives have been made possible by the advent of smartphones with embedded software, hardware, high-performance computing, and connectivity capabilities. A careful review of breathing sounds and their implications in identifying breathing complications suggests that the breathing sounds of COVID-19 contracted users may reveal certain acoustic signal patterns, which is worth investigating. To this end, acquiring respiratory data solely from breathing sounds fed to the smartphone's microphone strikes as a very appealing resolution. The acquired breathing sounds can be analyzed using advanced signal processing and analysis in tandem with new deep/machine learning and pattern recognition techniques to separate the breathing phases, estimate the lung volume, oxygenation, and to further classify the breathing data input into healthy or unhealthy cases. The ideas presented have the potential to be deployed as self-test breathing monitoring apps for the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic, where users can check their breathing sound pattern frequently through the app.","Faezipour, Miad; Abuzneid, Abdelshakour",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,661,1

However, although these applications can have actionable effects on public health efforts to control pandemics, the participatory or voluntary nature of these measures is obscuring the relationship between health information and traditional government surveillance techniques, potentially preventing effective oversight. Public health measures have traditionally been resistant to the integration of government-led intelligence techniques, such as signals intelligence (SIGINT), because of ethical and legal issues arising from the nature of surveillance techniques.We explore this rise of participatory SIGINT and its nature as an extension of biosurveillance through 3 drivers: the rise of surveillance capitalism, the exploitation of a public health crisis to obscure state of exception politics with a moral imperative, and the historically enduring nature of emergency-implemented surveillance measures.We conclude that although mobile applications may indeed be useful in containing pandemics, they should be subject to similar oversight and regulation as other government intelligence collection techniques.

Using genetic lineage tracing with sequential injury, heterochronic adoptive transfer, and parabiosis, we found that the lung microenvironment drove an age-related resistance of alveolar macrophages to proliferation that persisted during influenza A viral infection. Ligand-receptor pair analysis localized these changes to the extracellular matrix, where hyaluronan was increased in aged animals and altered the proliferative response of bone marrow-derived macrophages to granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF).

We used somatic mutations detected by genome-wide screens in melanoma and reported in the Catalog Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer (COSMIC). As a measure of UV sensitivity, we used the number of silent mutations generated by C>T transitions in pyrimidine dimers of a given transcript divided by the number of potential sites for this type of mutations in the transcript. We found that human genes varied by UV sensitivity by two orders of magnitude. We noted that the melanoma associated tumor suppressor gene CDKN2A was among the top five most UV-sensitive genes in the human genome. Melanoma driver genes have a higher UV-sensitivity compared to other genes in the human genome. The difference was more prominent for tumor suppressors compared to oncogene. The results of this study suggest that differential sensitivity of human transcripts to UV light may explain melanoma specificity of some driver genes. Practical significance of the study relates to the fact that differences in UV sensitivity among human genes need to be taken into consideration while predicting melanoma-associated genes by the number of somatic mutations detected in a given gene.

Methods: A retrospective analysis of the epidemiological history, clinical symptoms, signs, laboratory examinations, chest imaging, treatment and the short-term prognosis of 31 cases of 2019-nCoV was conducted. The patients were diagnosed between January 25th, 2020 and February 21st, 2020 in 21 hospitals in 17 cities of six provinces(autonomous region) of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Hebei, Henan and Shandong. Results: The age of the 31 children with 2019-nCoV infection was 7 years and 1 month (6 months -17 years). Nine cases (29%) were imported cases. Other 21 cases (68%) had contact with confirmed infected adults. One case (3%) had contact with asymptomatic returnees from Wuhan. Among the 31 children, 28 patients (90%) were family cluster cases. The clinical types were asymptomatic type in 4 cases (13%), mild type in 13 cases (42%), and common type in 14 cases (45%). No severe or critical type existed. The most common symptom was fever (n=20, 65%), including 1 case of high fever, 9 cases of moderate fever, 10 cases of low fever. Fever lasted from 1 day to 9 days. The fever of fifteen cases lasted for ≤3 d, while in other 5 cases lasted > 3 d. Other symptoms included cough (n=14, 45%), fatigue (n=3, 10%) and diarrhea (n=3, 9%). Pharyngalgia, runny nose, dizziness, headache and vomiting were rare. In the early stage, the total leukocytes count in peripheral blood decreased in 2 cases (6%), the lymphocytes count decreased in 2 cases (6%), and the platelet count increased in 2 cases (6%).Elevation of C-reactive protein (10%, 3/30), erythrocyte sedimentation rate(19%,4/21), procalcitonin(4%,1/28), liver enzyme(22%, 6/27) and muscle enzyme (15%, 4/27) occurred in different proportions. Renal function and blood glucose were normal. There were abnormal chest CT changes in 14 cases, including 9 cases with patchy ground glass opacities and nodules, mostly located in the lower lobe of both lungs near the pleural area. After receiving supportive treatment, the viral nucleic acid turned negative in 25 cases within 7-23 days. Among them, 24 children (77%) recovered and were discharged from hospital. No death occurred. Conclusions: In this case series, 2019-nCoV infections in children from six provinces (autonomous region) in northern China are mainly caused by close family contact.

This paper examines the current responses in New South Wales prisons to the threat of COVID-19 to prisoner health, by contrasting contemporary activities with actions and policy developed during two historical epidemics: the influenza epidemic of 1860 and pandemic of 1919. Method Epidemiological information relating to cases of disease in NSW prisons during the 1860 and 1919 influenza epidemics was obtained from the Comptroller-General's reports for the specific outbreak years and for the preceding and succeeding five-year periods. Additional archival sources such as digitised newspaper reports and articles available through the National Library of Australia were analysed for closer detail. The management of these outbreaks was compared to current strategies to mitigate against risk from the COVID-19 pandemic in the NSW prison system. Results Interesting similarities were discovered in relation to the management of the historic influenza outbreaks in NSW prisons and in the management of the current COVID-19 pandemic. An outbreak of influenza in mid-1860 impacted seven penal institutions in Sydney and Parramatta. Infection rates at these institutions were between 3.1% and 100%; the mean rate was 41.8%. The public health measures employed at the time included allowing 'air circulation freely night and day', and treatments that were 'tonical and stimulatory'. Discussion While the past 100 or more years have brought huge progress in scientific knowledge, public health approaches remain the mainstay of outbreak management in prisons; and, as in 1919, the opportunity for Australia to observe the rest of the world and plan for action has not been wasted. Prisons pose a potential risk for pandemic spread but they also present a unique opportunity for reducing disease risk by ironic virtue of the 'separate system' that was recognised even 100 years ago as characteristic of these institutions.","Hampton, Stephen; Weston, Kathryn M; McCarthy, Louella; Mackinnon, Tobias",Communicable diseases intelligence,661,27

Prior to 1980, U.S. national demographic and health data collection did not identify individuals of Hispanic/Latina/o heritage as a population group. Post-1990, robust immigration from Latin America (e.g., South America, Central America, Mexico) and subsequent growth in U.S. births, dynamically reconstructed the ethnoracial lines among Latinos from about 20 countries, increasing racial admixture and modifying patterns of health disparities. The increasing racial and class heterogeneity of U.S. Latina/os demands a critical analysis of sociodemographic factors associated with population health disparities. Purposes. To determine the state of available Latina/o population demographic and health data in the United States, assess demographic and health variables and trends from 1960 to the present, and identify current strengths, gaps, and areas of improvement. Method. Analysis of 101 existing data sets that included demographic, socioeconomic, and health characteristics of the U.S. Latina/o population, grouped by three, 20-year intervals: 1960-1979, 1980-1999, and 2000-2019. Results. Increased Latina/o immigration and U.S. births between 1960 and 2019 was associated with increases of Latino population samples in data collection. Findings indicate major gaps in the following four areas: children and youth younger than 18 years, gender and sexual identity, race and mixed-race measures, and immigration factors including nativity and generational status. Conclusions. The analysis of existing ethnoracial Latina/o population data collection efforts provides an opportunity for critical analysis of past trends, future directions in data collection efforts, and an equity lens to guide appropriate community health interventions and policies that will contribute to decreasing health disparities in Latina/o populations.","Enid Zambrana, Ruth; Amaro, Gabriel; Butler, Courtney; DuPont-Reyes, Melissa; Parra-Medina, Deborah",Health education & behavior : the official publication of the Society for Public Health Education,661,1

Tolcapone is a catechol-O-methyl-transferase (COMT) enzyme inhibitor that augments cortical dopaminergic transmission. Conduct a proof of concept study to examine whether a COMT inhibitor would reduce OCD symptoms to a greater extent than placebo. METHODS We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover trial in adults with OCD (N = 20). Participants were assessed at baseline, after 2 weeks of tolcapone, and again after 2 weeks of placebo on measures of OCD symptom severity and psychosocial functioning. There was a 1-week washout period between the 2-week treatment phases. RESULTS Two weeks of tolcapone was associated with significant improvement in OCD versus two weeks of placebo (t = 2.194, P = 0.0409). The mean percentage decreases in the total Yale-Brown obsessive-compulsive scale (YBOCS) scores for the entire sample over the corresponding 2-week period were 16.4% for tolcapone and 3.6% for placebo.

While strengthening social support is a common recommendation to reduce such mental health risk, no systematic review or meta-analysis has yet examined the relationship between social support and mental problems during pregnancy. METHODS The PRISMA checklist was used as a guide to systematically review relevant peer-reviewed literature reporting primary data analyses. PubMed, Psych Info, MIDIRS, SCOPUS, and CINAHL database searches were conducted to retrieve research articles published between the years 2000 to 2019. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale tool was used for quality appraisal and the meta-analysis was conducted using STATA. The Q and the I2 statistics were used to evaluate heterogeneity. A random-effects model was used to pool estimates. Publication bias was assessed using a funnel plot and Egger's regression test and adjusted using trim and Fill analysis. RESULT From the identified 3760 articles, 67 articles with 64,449 pregnant women were part of the current systematic review and meta-analysis. From the total 67 articles, 22 and 45 articles included in the narrative analysis and meta-analysis, respectively. From the total articles included in the narrative analysis, 20 articles reported a significant relationship between low social support and the risk of developing mental health problems (i.e. depression, anxiety, and self-harm) during pregnancy. After adjusting for publication bias, based on the results of the random-effect model, the pooled odds ratio (POR) of low social support was AOR: 1.18 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.41) for studies examining the relationship between low social support and antenatal depression and AOR: 1.97 (95% CI: 1.34, 2.92) for studies examining the relationship between low social support and antenatal anxiety. CONCLUSION Low social support shows significant associations with the risk of depression, anxiety, and self-harm during pregnancy. Policy-makers and those working on maternity care should consider the development of targeted social support programs with a view to helping reduce mental health problems amongst pregnant women.","Bedaso, Asres; Adams, Jon; Peng, Wenbo; Sibbritt, David",Reproductive health,661,17

The National Joint Registry for England and Wales reported 5082 revision TKRs in 2010, of which 1157 (23%) were caused by infection. The diagnosis of infection beyond the acute post-operative stage relies on the identification of the causative organism by aspiration and analysis of material obtained at arthroscopy. Ideal treatment then involves a two-stage surgical procedure with extensive debridement and washout, followed by antibiotics. An articulating or non-articulating drug-eluting cement spacer is used prior to implantation of the revision prosthesis, guided by the serum level of inflammatory markers. The use of a single-stage revision is gaining popularity and we would advocate its use in certain patients where the causative organism is known, no sinuses are present, the patient is not immunocompromised, and there is no radiological evidence of component loosening or osteitis. It is our opinion that single-stage revision produces high-quality reproducible results and will soon achieve the same widespread acceptance as it does in infected hip arthroplasty.","Vanhegan, I S; Morgan-Jones, R; Barrett, D S; Haddad, F S",The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

Herein, we characterized a novel polysaccharide lyase AlgSH17 from marine bacterium Microbulbifer sp. SH-1. The recombinant enzyme exhibited the maximum activity at 30 °C, pH 7.0 and retained 86.20% and 65.43% of its maximum activity at 20 °C and 15 °C, respectively, indicating that AlgSH17 has an excellent cold-adapted property. The final products of AlgSH17 mainly consisted of monosaccharides with small amounts of oligosaccharides with degrees of polymerization (DP) 2-6, suggesting that AlgSH17 possesses both exolytic and endolytic activity. Degradation pattern analysis indicated that AlgSH17 could degrade DP ≥ 4 oligosaccharides into disaccharides and trisaccharides by cleaving the endo-glycosidic bonds and further digest disaccharides and trisaccharides into monosaccharides in an exolytic manner. Products distribution and molecular docking analysis revealed that AlgSH17 could cleave the glycosidic bonds between -1 and +2 within the substrate. Furthermore, The ABTS+, hydroxyl and DPPH radicals scavenging activity of the enzymatic hydrolysates prepared by AlgSH17 reached up to 91.53%, 81.23% and 61.06%, respectively, and the enzymatic hydrolysates displayed an excellent preservation effect on fresh-cut apples. The above results suggested that AlgSH17 could be utilized for the production of monosaccharides, antioxidants and food additives.","Yang, Jin; Cui, Dandan; Ma, Shuo; Chen, Wenkang; Chen, Diwen; Shen, Hong",International journal of biological macromolecules,661,31

ANIMALS 30 crossbred 10-day-old pigs. PROCEDURES Tissue culture PEDV was diluted to form 8 serial 10-fold dilutions. An aliquot of stock virus (5.6 × 10(5) TCID50/mL) and each serial PEDV dilution were mixed into 4.5-kg batches of feed to create 9 PEDV-inoculated feed doses; 1 virus-negative dose of culture medium in feed was also created. Pigs were challenge exposed via oral administration of PEDV-inoculated feed, and fecal swab specimens were collected. All pigs were euthanized 7 days after challenge exposure; fresh tissues were collected and used for PCR assay, histologic examination, and immunohistochemical analysis. RESULTS The PCR cycle threshold (Ct) decreased by approximately 10 when PEDV was added to feed, compared with results for equivalent PEDV diluted in tissue culture medium. Pigs became infected with PEDV when challenge exposed with the 4 highest concentrations (lowest concentration to cause infection, 5.6 × 10(1) TCID50/g; Ct = 27 in tissue culture medium and 37 in feed). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE In this study, PEDV in feed with detectable Ct values of 27 to 37 was infective. The Ct was 37 for the lowest infective PEDV dose in feed, which may be above the limit of detection established for PEDV PCR assays used by some diagnostic laboratories. Overall, results indicated 5.6 × 10(1) TCID50/g was the minimum PEDV dose in feed that can lead to infection in 10-day-old pigs under the conditions of this study.","Schumacher, Loni L; Woodworth, Jason C; Jones, Cassandra K; Chen, Qi; Zhang, Jianqiang; Gauger, Phillip C; Stark, Charles R; Main, Rodger G; Hesse, Richard A; Tokach, Mike D; Dritz, Steve S",American journal of veterinary research,661,24

Drugs with quinoline scaffolds have long been studied to repurpose their useful broad-spectrum properties into treating various diseases, including viruses. Preliminary studies on the quinoline medications, Chloroquine and Hydroxy chloroquine, against SARS-CoV2, have shown to be a potential area of interest for drug development, due to their ability to prevent viral entry, act as anti-inflammatory modulators, and inhibit key enzymes allowing reduced viral infectivity. In addition to Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine, we discuss analogs of the drugs to understand the quinoline scaffold's potential antiviral mechanisms. The heterocyclic scaffold of quinoline can be modified in many ways primarily through the modification of its substituents, we cover these different synthetic derivatives to understand properties that could enhance its antiviral specificity thoroughly. Chloroquine and its analogs can act on various stages of the viral life cycle pre and post entry. In this study, we review Chloroquine and its synthetic and natural analogs for their antiviral properties in a variety of different viruses.

While interventions have been implemented to optimize how this skill is taught in medical school, it remains an area of concern and anxiety for many medical students. To date, a comprehensive assessment of these interventions has not been done. The authors conducted a systematic review of the literature on interventions that aim to improve medical student education on gynecological exams. METHOD The authors searched 6 databases (Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, EBSCO CINAHL Plus, Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection, ERIC [Proquest]) from inception to August 4, 2020. Studies were included if they met the following criteria: focus on medical students, intervention with the purpose of teaching students to better perform gynecological exams, and reported outcomes/evaluation. Extracted data included study location, study design, sample size, details of the intervention and evaluation, and context of the pelvic exam. All outcomes were summarized descriptively; key outcomes were coded as subjective or objective assessments. RESULTS The search identified 5,792 studies; 50 met the inclusion criteria. The interventions described were diverse, with many controlled studies evaluating multiple methods of instruction. Gynecological teaching associates (GTAs), or professional patients, were the most common method of education. GTA-led teaching resulted in improvements in student confidence, competence, and communication skills. Physical adjuncts, or anatomic models and simulators, were the second most common category of intervention. Less resource intensive interventions, such as self-directed learning packages, online training modules, and video clips also demonstrated positive results in student comfort and competence. All studies highlighted the need for improved education on gynecological exams. CONCLUSIONS The literature included evaluations of numerous interventions for improving medical student comfort and competence in performing gynecological exams. GTA-led teaching may be the most impactful educational tool described, though less resource intensive interventions can also be effective.","Kirubarajan, Abirami; Li, Xinglin; Got, Tiffany; Yau, Matthew; Sobel, Mara",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,661,10

Data collected in Italy show that of the diagnosed cases of COVID-19, 2.1% involved children aged 0-9 years and 4.0% children aged 10-19 years, with a mortality rate close to zero. In recent weeks, however, there has been a considerable increase in cases in the paediatric and adolescent population-many of which are asymptomatic-and 16% of the cases reported to the health surveillance system were of subjects under the age of 19. Schools account for 2.5% of new outbreaks, therefore the focus must be shifted to prevention measures such as daily temperature checks, management of suspicious cases at school, and the possibility of using rapid tests at school, due to the high frequency of febrile episodes during winter, in order to distinguish suspected Covid cases from the seasonal flu. Data at hand, scientific studies confirm that children of all ages can be infected with the coronavirus and spread it to others and that in the school environment the spread of the virus can become critical especially in the presence of ""super-spreaders"". In fact, it has recently been shown that the majority of patients (70%) with Covid-19 have never infected anyone else, while only 8% of patients are linked to 60% of new infections. Prevention is crucial and it represents the only way to win the fight against coronavirus, a fight that will also be fought in the classroom during fall.

We tested peritoneal flexible endoscopy through a port placed in the abdominal wall in the early postoperative course, as a new diagnostic method for detection of this complication and evaluated the suggested method for safety, feasibility, and accuracy. METHODS Ten swine were randomized into 2 groups: group A, colorectal anastomosis without leakage; and group B, colorectal anastomosis with leakage. A button gastrostomy feeding tube was inserted percutaneously into the peritoneal cavity. Colorectal anastomosis (with or without defect) was created 48 hours after the first operation. The swine were examined by peritoneal flexible endoscopy 8 and 24 hours after the colonic operation, by a consultant surgeon who was blinded to both the presence and the allocated location of the of the anastomotic defect. RESULTS None of the animals showed signs of illness 48 hours after the intraperitoneal gastrostomy tube placement. More than half of the anastomosis circumference was identified in 60 and 10% of the animals at endoscopy 8 and 24 hours, respectively, after the anastomosis was created. Excessive adhesion formation was observed in all animals, irrespective of AL. The sensitivity and specificity of endoscopy in detecting peritonitis 24 hours after AL were both 60%. CONCLUSIONS Peritoneal endoscopy is a safe and simple procedure. Visualization of the peritoneal cavity in the early postoperative course was limited due to adhesion formation. Further studies are needed to clarify the accuracy of the procedure and to address additional methodological concerns.","Zogovic, Sergej; Gaarden, Morten; Mortensen, Frank Viborg",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,661,14

Ineffective chemotherapy of TB that keeps a substantial proportion of patients alive without cure may amplify resistance during treatment and promote transmission of TB. In 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that in patients who require TB retreatment, the retreatment regimen that comprised 8 months of isoniazid, rifampicin and ethambutol supplemented by streptomycin for the initial 2 months, and pyrazinamide for the initial 3 months (2SHRZE/HRZE/5HRE) should no longer be prescribed and drug susceptibility testing (DST) should be conducted to inform the choice of treatment regimen. While GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay may detect rifampicin resistance, it does not detect isoniazid resistance. A 6-month regimen consisting of rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol may be used for the treatment of previously treated cases in whom rifampicin resistance has been excluded but DST of isoniazid is not available. WHO recommended to treat isoniazid-resistant, rifampicin-susceptible TB (Hr-TB) with rifampicin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide and levofloxacin for a duration of 6 months. In several low- and middle-income countries, the majority of Hr-TB cases are detected after the initiation of treatment with first-line regimens. If patients have an unsatisfactory response to first-line treatment with persistent positive sputum, modification of regimens needs to be done very carefully. Adding a fluoroquinolone in cases with undetected rifampicin resistance runs the risk of acquired fluoroquinolone resistance. Recently, WHO advises NTPs to phase out the injectable-containing short regimen for multidrug-resistant and rifampicin-resistant TB (MDR-/RR-TB) and recommends that the preferred treatment option is a shorter, all-oral, bedaquiline-containing regimen. WHO emphasizes that access to rapid DST, especially for ruling out fluoroquinolone resistance, is required before starting the bedaquiline-containing shorter regimen. The problem is that access to rapid DST for ruling out fluoroquinolone resistance is limited in low- and middle-income countries. The use of WHO-recommended bedaquiline-containing regimens in the treatment of MDR-/RR-TB patients with undetected resistance to fluoroquinolones runs a high risk of acquired bedaquiline resistance, especially in settings with a high prevalence of fluoroquinolone resistance. It is crucial to mitigate the risks of both primary and acquired resistance of rifampicin, fluoroquinolone and bedaquiline by rational design of regimens and effective management of TB patients.","Chiang, Chen-Yuan; Lin, Chou-Jui",The Indian journal of tuberculosis,661,1

OBJECTIVE To systematically review and meta-analyze the risk of VP/VLBW and EP/ELBW individuals to develop a ADHD categorical diagnosis or dimensional symptomatology compared with controls with normal weight and/or birth age. DATA SOURCES We used PsycINFO, Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases. STUDY SELECTION We selected cross-sectional, prospective, or retrospective studies with no time or language restriction. DATA EXTRACTION Independent reviewers screened and extracted data using predefined standard procedures. RESULTS In 12 studies (N = 1787), researchers relying on a categorical diagnosis showed that both VP/VLBW and EP/ELBW subjects have a higher ADHD risk (odds ratio [OR] = 3.04 higher than controls; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.19 to 4.21). In subgroup analyses, we demonstrated that the more extreme the cases, the higher the ORs (VP/VLBW: OR = 2.25 [95% CI 1.56 to 3.26]; EP/ELBW: OR = 4.05 [95% CI 2.38 to 6.87]). We drew data from 29 studies (N = 3504) on ADHD symptomatology and found significant associations with inattention (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 1.31, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.96), hyperactivity and impulsivity (SMD = 0.74, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.13), and combined symptoms (SMD = 0.55, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.68) when compared with controls. LIMITATIONS Heterogeneity was significantly high for all analyses involving the 3 ADHD dimensions. CONCLUSIONS With our results, we provide evidence that VP/VLBW subjects have an increased risk of ADHD diagnosis and symptomatology compared with controls, and these findings are even stronger in the EP/ELBW group. Future researchers should address which risk factors related to prematurity or low birth weight lead to ADHD.","Franz, Adelar Pedro; Bolat, Gul Unsel; Bolat, Hilmi; Matijasevich, Alicia; Santos, Iná Silva; Silveira, Rita C; Procianoy, Renato Soibelmann; Rohde, Luis Augusto; Moreira-Maia, Carlos Renato",Pediatrics,661,5

Many field experiments have observed large sensitivity of leaf C:N ratio to eCO2 and iNDEP. However, the large-scale pattern of this sensitivity is still unclear, because eCO2 and iNDEP drive leaf C:N ratio toward opposite directions, which are further compounded by the complex processes of nitrogen acquisition and plant-and-microbial nitrogen competition. Here, we attempt to map the leaf C:N ratio spatial variation in the past 5 decades in China with a combination of data-driven model and process-based modeling. These two approaches showed consistent results. Over different regions, we found that leaf C:N ratio had significant but uneven changes between 2 time periods (1960-1989 and 1990-2015): a 5% ± 8% increase for temperate grasslands in northern China, a 3% ± 6% increase for boreal grasslands in western China, and by contrast, a 7% ± 6% decrease for temperate forests in southern China, and a 3% ± 5% decrease for boreal forests in northeastern China. Additionally, the structural equation models indicated that the leaf C:N change was sensitive to ΔNDEP, ΔCO2 and ΔMAT rather than ΔMAP and ecosystem types. Process-based modeling suggested that iNDEP was the main source of soil mineral nitrogen change, dominating leaf C:N ratio change in most areas in China, while eCO2 led to leaf C:N ratio increase in low iNDEP area. This study also indicates that the long-term leaf C:N ratio acclimation was dominated by climate constraint, especially temperature, but was constrained by soil N availability over decade scale.","Sheng, Mingyang; Tang, Jinyun; Yang, Dawen; Fisher, Joshua B; Wang, Han; Kattge, Jens",The Science of the total environment,661,1

Toll-like receptors (TLRs), especially TLR4 which participates in mucosal immunity, may be involved in the pathogenesis of IgAN. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether sIgA and TLR4 interact to mediate kidney damage in IgAN patients. IgAN patients with positive sIgA deposition in renal tissues were screened by immunofluorescence assay. Patient salivary sIgA (P-sIgA) was collected and purified by jacalin affinity chromatography. Salivary sIgA from healthy volunteers was used as a control (N-sIgA). Expression of TLR4, MyD88, NF-κB, TNF-α, IL-6, and MCP-1 were detected in the mesangial area of IgAN patients by immunohistochemistry, the expression levels in patients with positive sIgA deposition were higher than that with negative sIgA deposition. Human renal mesangial cells (HRMCs) were cultured in vitro, flow cytometry showed that P-sIgA bound HRMCs significantly better than N-sIgA. HRMCs were cultured in the presence of sIgA (400 μg/mL) for 24 h, compared with cells cultured with N-sIgA, HRMCs cultured in vitro with P-sIgA showed enhanced expression of TLR4, increased secretion of TNF-α, IL-6, and MCP-1, and increased expression of MyD88/NF-κB. TLR4 shRNA silencing and NF-κB inhibition both reduced the ability of HRMCs to synthesize TNF-α, IL-6, and MCP-1. Our results indicate that sIgA may induce high expression of TLR4 in HRMCs and further activate downstream signalling pathways, prompting HRMCs to secrete multiple cytokines and thereby mediating kidney damage in IgAN patients.","Zhang, Junjun; Mi, Yiming; Zhou, Ruwen; Liu, Zhangsuo; Huang, Bo; Guo, Ruxue; Wang, Panfei; Lu, Yanru; Zhou, Yali; Quan, Songxia",Journal of nephrology,661,5

The quarantine effects on surgically-treated fractures, operated during this period (March 9th - May 4th) in two public Greek institutions, the ""Venizeleion"" General Hospital of Crete (VGH) and the ""251"" Hellenic Air Force General Hospital of Athens (""251"" HAFGH) were evaluated and compared with those of the same period of 2019. Materials and methods: This is a retrospective study of a prospectively collected database. Evaluated data included gender, age, and trauma mechanism. Outcomes: A total of 103 patients who had suffered fractures were surgically treated in both institutions during the quarantine period of 2020 compared to 179 during the same period of 2019, showing a reduction of 43% in surgical cases. The mean age of patients treated in 2020 was 72.2 (SD=19.9), as compared to 65.3 (SD=21.5; p-value=0.008) in 2019. There were 70 (68%) elderly patients (>65 years) in 2020 and 103 (57.6%) in 2019. Of all treated fractures, 31% were caused by high energy mechanisms during the explored period of 2020, as compared to 45% in 2019 (p-value=0.019). Conclusions: This is the first study in Europe evaluating the effect of COVID-19 quarantine on surgically treated fractures. The findings showed a significant decline in surgically treated fractures, particularly high-energy fractures, along with a significantly higher mean age of patients in 2020 compared to 2019. Low-energy fractures in elderly during quarantine emphasizes the need of prevention measures to minimize their incidence, especially in a time when the health personnel and resources are engaged in the battle against COVID-19.","Koutserimpas, Christos; Raptis, Konstantinos; Tsakalou, Despina; Papadaki, Chrysoula; Magarakis, George; Kourelis, Konstantinos; Samonis, George; Alpantaki, Kalliopi",Maedica,661,26

Securing water will require more work and time, burdening women and children the most. Currently, the consequences of this time burden to children's development remain understudied. To address this gap, we examine the tradeoff between children's household water collection responsibilities and learning achievement. Using nationally representative data from India, we measure the effect of daily fetching time on primary school children's learning achievement in a two-stage regression model, with rainfall as the instrument. Our analyses indicate that higher fetching times predict lower mathematics (-1.23 standard deviations, 95CI[-2.32, -0.14]), reading (-1.13 standard deviations, 95CI[-2.07, -0.19]), and writing (-1.21 standard deviations, 95CI[-1.89, -0.51]) test scores. These effects are heterogeneous across sex and infrastructure type. For example, we find girls' mathematical and reading skills profit more from reductions in fetching time than boys' (score less affected for boys by β amount: mathematics: β=0.26 points, 95CI[0.095, 0.42]; reading: β=0.27 points, 95CI[0.054, 0.49]). Children using hand pumps, open wells, or tube wells are hurt more academically in mathematics and writing by increases in fetching time than children with mostly off-premises piped access (e.g., writing scores more affected by β amount: hand pump: β=-0.18, 95CI[-0.29, -0.081]; open well: β=-0.18, 95CI[-0.33, -0.040]; tube well: β=-0.14, 95CI[-0.29, -0.00072]). Given these results, we recommend off-premises piped infrastructure in the absence of piped-to-premises water in water-insecure contexts and offer guidance for targeting infrastructure investments in India.","Hamlet, Leigh C; Chakrabarti, Suman; Kaminsky, Jessica",Water research,661,31

Successful learning was accompanied by an initial frontal N400 that decreased in amplitude across blocks during the first day and shifted to parietal sites during the last training day. In Experiment 2, we replicated our findings with 38 new participants randomly assigned to a consistent learning or an inconsistent learning group. The N400 amplitude modulations that we found, both within and between learning sessions, are taken to reflect the emergence of novel lexical traces even when learning concerns items for which no semantic information is provided. The shift in N400 topography suggests that different N400 neural generators may contribute to specific word learning steps through a balance between domain-general and language-specific mechanisms.","Ramos-Escobar, Neus; Laine, Matti; Sanseverino-Dillenburg, Mariana; Cucurell, David; François, Clément; Rodriguez-Fornells, Antoni",NeuroImage,661,31

These problems suggest deficiencies in recruiting and/or maturation of oligodendrocyte progentior cells (OPCs) and highlight cell replacement therapies to promote remyelination. We have used a model of viral-induced demyelination to characterize signaling cues associated with positional migration of transplanted remyelination-competent cells. Although successful transplantation of rodent-derived glial cell types into models of MS has been performed, the mechanisms by which these cells navigate within an inflammatory environment created by a persistent virus has not been defined. Infection of the mouse CNS with the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) results in an immune-mediated demyelinating disease with clinical and histologic similarities to MS. Surgical engraftment of GFP+ neural stem cells (NSCs) into spinal cords of JHMV-infected mice with established demyelination results in migration, proliferation, and differentiation of the cells into OPCs and mature oligodendrocytes that is associated with increased axonal remyelination. Treatment with anti-CXCL12 [stromal derived factor-1alpha, (SDF-1alpha)] blocking serum resulted in a marked impairment in migration and proliferation of engrafted stem cells. Moreover, small molecule-mediated antagonism of CXCR4, but not CXCR7, impaired migration and proliferation, to an extent similar to that with anti-CXCL12 treatment. These data highlight the importance of the CXCL12:CXCR4 pathway in regulating homing of engrafted stem cells to sites of tissue damage within the CNS of mice persistently infected with a neurotropic virus undergoing immune-mediated demyelination.","Carbajal, Kevin S; Schaumburg, Christopher; Strieter, Robert; Kane, Joy; Lane, Thomas E",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,661,1

To reduce person-to-person transmission, interventions such as social distancing have been recommended; however, it is anticipated that 80% compliance is required to control the outbreak. A questionnaire was used to assess the factors related to compliance with social distancing restrictions using a modified version of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) that included participants' understanding of restrictions. The questionnaire included 18 vignettes (violating, non-violating and ambiguous) to assess participants' knowledge of the social distancing restrictions and intentions to violate them. Participants were also presented the social distancing restrictions relevant at the time of completion and they were asked to consider the restrictions when anticipating their behavior in the vignettes. In line with the predictions of the TPB, intentions to adhere to restrictions and perceived behavioral control predicted participants' self-reported behaviors. Further, attitudes (ATT) toward social distancing restrictions and knowledge of the restrictions predicted intentions to adhere to them.

Most viruses retain an active recombination machinery as a potential means to initiate new levels of genetic exploration that go beyond those attainable solely by point mutations. However, despite abundant recombination that may be linked to molecular events essential for genome replication, herein we provide evidence that generation of recombinants with altered biological properties is not essential for the completion of the replication cycles of viruses, and that viral lineages (near-clades) can be defined. We distinguish mechanistically active but inconsequential recombination from evolutionarily relevant recombination, illustrated by episodes in the field and during experimental evolution. In the field, recombination has been at the origin of new viral pathogens, and has conferred fitness advantages to some viruses once the parental viruses have attained a sufficient degree of diversification by point mutations. In the laboratory, recombination mediated a salient genome segmentation of foot-and-mouth disease virus, an important animal pathogen whose genome in nature has always been characterized as unsegmented. We propose a model of continuous mutation and recombination, with punctuated, biologically relevant recombination events for the survival of viruses, both as disease agents and as promoters of cellular evolution. Thus, clonality is the standard evolutionary mode for viruses because recombination is largely inconsequential, since the decisive events for virus replication and survival are not dependent on the exchange of genetic material and formation of recombinant (mosaic) genomes.","Perales, Celia; Moreno, Elena; Domingo, Esteban",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,661,1

Based on a single-center experience during the course of one decade, we present data on safety and efficacy of previous MT devices compared with modern stent retriever and suction thrombectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS Eighty-one patients (29 women, 52 men, mean age 61.5 years, range 17-90) with angiographically confirmed BAO that had been treated by MT between 2001 and 2011 were retrospectively evaluated. Patients in group 1 (n = 60) had been treated between 2001 and 2008 with different devices available at that time. Patients in group 2 (n = 21) had been treated by modern stent retriever or local suction devices between 2008 and 2011. Recanalization rate, needle to recanalization time, procedure-related complications, and distal embolization of thrombotic material were recorded and compared. RESULTS Recanalization rates of 95% were high in both groups. Procedure-related dissection (n = 5) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (n = 9) occurred in group 1 but not in group 2 (p < 0.016). Needle-to-recanalization time was less than half in group 2 compared with group 1 (54.6 vs. 132.3 min, p < 0.01). Frequency of distal embolization was comparable in both groups (47%). CONCLUSION High recanalization rates have been achieved since the introduction of MT in BAO. However, modern stent retriever and suction devices allow for safer and more rapid recanalization compared with previous MT devices.","Fesl, Gunther; Holtmannspoetter, Markus; Patzig, Maximilian; Mayer, Thomas E; Pfefferkorn, Thomas; Brueckmann, Hartmut; Schulte-Altedorneburg, Gernot",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,661,1

This case report describes a successful treatment protocol for chytridiomycosis in laboratory-maintained colonies of axolotls (Ambystoma mexicanum) and rough-skinned newts (Taricha granulosa). Over 12 mo, axolotls (n = 12) in a laboratory-reared colony developed multifocal erythematous dermatitis, mainly on the distal limbs and tails. Wild-caught newts handled by the same lab personnel were housed in an adjacent room and occasionally presented with abdominal distension and lethargy. Differentials included poor water quality, pathogen infection, parasitic infestation, and trauma. Antibiotic treatment of animals according to results of bacterial culture and sensitivity, combined with bleach disinfection of aquaria, did not resolve clinical signs. Skin swabs from clinically affected axolotls submitted for a newly available commercial screen were positive for B. dendrobatidis. Additional PCR and sequencing analysis revealed chytrid-positive animals among group-housed newts in 2 clinically unaffected aquaria and suspected PCR-positives for 2 affected newt aquaria and an additional axolotl. Axolotls with skin lesions (n = 2) and newts with abdominal distension and lethargy (n = 2) underwent experimental treatment with itraconazole submersion (0.002% to 0.0025%; 5 min daily for 10 d). This pilot treatment was well tolerated and led to clinical resolution. Subsequent itraconazole treatment of the entire colony led to regrowth of extremities and restoration of normal coloration among axolotls. During treatment, the facility was decontaminated, and additional biosecurity measures were developed. PCR results after the pilot treatment and subsequent full-colony treatments (at 1 wk, 1 mo, and 6 mo after treatment) were negative for the presence of B. dendrobatidis. Because chytridiomycosis is a reportable animal disease in our state, colonies officially remained quarantined until negative PCR results were obtained at least 6 mo after treatment.","Del Valle, Jacquelyn M; Eisthen, Heather L",Comparative medicine,661,12

Methods: Using data from 32 691 patients with stable CAD from the prospective observational CLARIFY registry, anginal status was mapped each year in patients without new coronary revascularization or new myocardial infarction. The use of medical interventions in the year preceding angina resolution was explored. The effect of 1-year changes in angina status on 5-year outcomes was analyzed using multivariable analysis. Results: Among 7212 (22.1%) patients who reported angina at baseline, angina disappeared (without coronary revascularization) in 39.6% at 1 year, with further annual decreases. In patients without angina at baseline, 2.0-4.8% developed angina each year. During 5-year follow-up, angina was controlled in 7773 patients, in whom resolution of angina was obtained with increased use of antianginal treatment in 11.1%, with coronary revascularization in 4.5%, and without any changes in medication or revascularization in 84.4%. Compared to patients without angina at baseline and 1 year, persistence of angina and occurrence of angina at 1 year with conservative management were each independently associated with higher rates of cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12-1.55 for persistence of angina; adjusted HR 1.37, 95% CI 1.11-1.70 for occurrence of angina) at 5 years. Patients whose angina had resolved at 1 year with conservative management were not at higher risk of cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction than those who never experienced angina (adjusted HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.82-1.15). Conclusions: Angina affects almost one-quarter of patients with stable CAD but resolves without events or coronary revascularization in most patients. Resolution of angina within 1 year with conservative management predicted outcomes similar to lack of angina, while persistence or occurrence was associated with worse outcomes. As most patients with angina are likely to experience resolution of symptoms, and as there is no demonstrated outcome benefit to routine revascularization, this study emphasizes the value of conservative management of stable CAD.

This study measures the public support for policies designed to increase housing stability and gauges whether support levels are associated with views about the role of evictions in COVID-19 transmission and the existence of racial inequities in the housing market. METHODS A cross-sectional survey with a representative sample of U.S. adults in November 2020 assessed support for 4 housing policies. Logistic regression models estimated the adjusted levels of support for each policy, with separate models testing the association with whether or not a respondent recognized the role of evictions in increased COVID-19 transmission or acknowledged racial inequities in the housing market. RESULTS Most U.S. adults supported policies aimed to increase housing stability during the COVID-19 pandemic, including extending moratoriums on evictions (63%) and foreclosures (67%) and increasing emergency rental assistance (63%). In total, 54% supported increased government spending on housing vouchers. Adults who agreed that averting eviction would slow COVID-19 transmission had higher support for housing stability policies, as did those who agreed that it was easier for White families to find affordable, high-quality housing than Black families. CONCLUSIONS Support for housing stability policies was strong among U.S. adults, particularly among those who agreed that preventing evictions slowed COVID-19 transmission and among those who acknowledged racial inequities in the housing market. Raising public awareness of the connections among unstable housing, infectious disease transmission, and racial inequity could broaden the support for policies to keep people in their homes through the pandemic.","Pollack, Craig Evan; Leifheit, Kathryn M; McGinty, Emma E; Levine, Adam S; Barry, Colleen L; Linton, Sabriya L",American journal of preventive medicine,661,31

Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) often present risk factors for postoperative complications. This accounts for reluctance to include them in ERPs. We compared outcome after right colectomy with an ERP in IBD and non-IBD patients. METHODS In our GRACE colorectal surgery database comprising 508 patients, we analysed patients scheduled for right colectomy (n = 160). Adherence to the protocol, postoperative complications and length of hospital stay of IBD patients (n = 45) were compared with those of non-IBD patients (n = 115). Data (mean ± SD, median [IQR], count (%)) were compared by Student's t, Mann-Whitney U and chi-square tests when appropriate; p < 0.05 taken as statistically significant. RESULTS IBD patients were significantly younger (38.9 ± 13.8 vs. 58.9 ± 18.5 years, p < 0.001) and had lower BMI (23.0 ± 5.0 vs. 25.1 ± 5.0 kg m-2, p < 0.01). Adherence to ERP was similar in the two groups. Resumption of eating on the day of the operation was less well tolerated (73.3% vs. 85.2%, p < 0.05) and postoperative pain (p < 0.001) was greater in IBD patients. The incidence of postoperative complications (13.3% vs. 17.3%) and the length of hospital stay (3 [3-4.5] vs. 3 [2-5] days) were comparable in IBD and non-IBD patients, respectively. CONCLUSION The management of IBD patients in an ERP is not only feasible but also indicated. These patients benefit as much from ERP as non-IBD patients.","Meunier, Anne; Sorce, Giuseppe; Hardy, Pierre-Yves; Coimbra, Carla; Decker, Emmanuel; Joris, Jean",International journal of colorectal disease,661,1

This systematic review aims to synthesize the reported ICI-associated IRAEs relevant to neuro-ophthalmologists to help in the diagnosis and management of these conditions. Methods A systematic review of the literature indexed by MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, and Web of Science databases was searched from inception to May 2020. Reporting followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Primary studies on ICIs and neuro-ophthalmic complications were included. Outcomes included number of cases and incidence of neuro-ophthalmic IRAEs. Results Neuro-ophthalmic complications of ICIs occurred in 0.46% of patients undergoing ICI and may affect the afferent and efferent visual systems. Afferent complications include optic neuritis (12.8%), neuroretinitis (0.9%), and giant cell arteritis (3.7%). Efferent complications include myasthenia gravis (MG) (45.0%), thyroid-like eye disease (11.9%), orbital myositis (13.8%), general myositis with ptosis (7.3%), internuclear ophthalmoplegia (0.9%), opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia syndrome (0.9%), and oculomotor nerve palsy (0.9%). Pembrolizumab was the most common causative agent for neuro-ophthalmic complications (32.1%). Mortality was highest for MG (19.8%). Most patients (79.8%) experienced improvement or complete resolution of neuro-ophthalmic symptoms due to cessation of ICI and immunosuppression with systemic corticosteroids. Conclusion While incidence of neuro-ophthalmic IRAEs is low, clinicians involved in the care of cancer patients must be aware of their presentation to facilitate prompt recognition and management. Collaboration between oncology and neuro-ophthalmology teams is required to effectively manage patients and reduce morbidity and mortality.","Yu, Caberry W; Yau, Matthew; Mezey, Natalie; Joarder, Ishraq; Micieli, Jonathan A",Eye and brain,661,1

We analyzed data comparing 2 subgroups: 1) patients on statin medication, and 2) patients not on statin medication at the time of the procedure and follow-up. Angiographic and clinical outcomes were compared by using the χ2 test, Fisher exact test, or Wilcoxon rank sum test. RESULTS We studied 1092 patients with 1221 aneurysms. At baseline, 226 patients were on statin medications and 866 patients were not on statin medications. The mean length of clinical and angiographic follow-up was 22.1 ± 15.1 months and 28.3 ± 23.7 months, respectively. There were no differences observed in angiographic outcomes at any time point between groups.

Its deficiency causes osteomalacia, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and an increased risk for fractures and falls. However, clinical and experimental evidence points to extra-skeletal actions of vitamin D, including on immune and respiratory systems. Thus, during this COVID-19 pandemic, a possible deleterious role of vitamin D deficiency has been questioned. This paper aims to present a brief review of the literature and discuss, based on evidence, the role of vitamin D in the lung function and in the prevention of respiratory infections. Relevant articles were searched in the databases MEDLINE/PubMed and SciELO/LILACS. The mechanisms of vitamin D action in the immune system response will be discussed. Clinical data from systematic reviews and meta-analyses show benefits in the prevention of respiratory infections and improvement of pulmonary function when vitamin D-deficient patients are supplemented. At the time of writing this paper, no published data on vitamin D supplementation for patients with COVID-19 have been found. Vitamin D supplementation is recommended during this period of social isolation to avoid any deficiency, especially in the context of bone outcomes, aiming to achieve normal values of 25(OH)D. The prevention of respiratory infections and improvement of pulmonary function are additional benefits observed when vitamin D deficiency is treated. Thus far, any protective effect of vitamin D specifically against severe COVID-19 remains unclear. We also emphasize avoiding bolus or extremely high doses of vitamin D, which can increase the risk of intoxication without evidence of benefits.","Dos Santos, Rodrigo Nolasco; Maeda, Sergio Setsuo; Jardim, José Roberto; Lazaretti-Castro, Marise",Archives of endocrinology and metabolism,661,29

Materials and Methods Following an a priori protocol, 5 databases were searched. Studies were appraised for quality using the Cochrane Risk of Bias assessment. Studies reporting either hemoglobin A1c pre- and post-intervention or its change at 6 or 12 months were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis using random effects models. Results Thirteen studies met the criteria for the systematic review and 10 for the meta-analysis and represent data from 3257 adults with diabetes (mean age 55 years; 66% female; 74% racial/ethnic minorities). Most studies ( n = 10) reflected an unclear risk of bias. Interventions varied by HIT type: computer software without Internet ( n = 2), cellular/automated telephone ( n = 4), Internet-based ( n = 4), and telemedicine/telehealth ( n = 3). Pooled A1c decreases were found at 6 months (-0.36 (95% CI, -0.53 and -0.19]; I 2 = 35.1%, Q = 5.0), with diminishing effect at 12 months (-0.27 [95% CI, -0.49 and -0.04]; I 2 = 42.4%, Q = 10.4). Discussion Findings suggest that medically underserved patients with diabetes achieve glycemic benefit following HIT DSME interventions, with dissipating but significant effects at 12 months. Telemedicine/telehealth interventions were the most successful HIT type because they incorporated interaction with educators similar to in-person DSME. Conclusion These results are similar to in-person DSME in medically underserved patients, showing that well-designed HIT DSME has the potential to increase access and improve outcomes for this vulnerable group.","Heitkemper, Elizabeth M; Mamykina, Lena; Travers, Jasmine; Smaldone, Arlene",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,661,1

RESULTS Fifty-seven patients with 57 wide-necked aneurysms arising from the middle cerebral artery bifurcation were identified. The technical success rate of stent deployment was 100%. Immediate postoperative angiograms showed Raymond 1 in 26 aneurysms (45.6%), Raymond 2 in 10 (17.6%), and Raymond 3 in 21 (36.8%). Perioperative complications developed in two patients (3.5%), including one procedure-related hemorrhagic event and one thromboembolic event. The follow-up angiogram was available for 47 aneurysms obtained at an average of 11.7 months (range, 5 to 49 months) after intervention; the latest follow-up angiograms revealed complete occlusion in 37 (78.7%) aneurysms, improvement in three (6.4%), stabilization in five (10.6%), and recanalization in two (4.3%). During the follow-up, one patient was found to have in-stent stenosis and two patients were found to have slow flow or occlusion of the jailed branch. All three of these patients were asymptomatic. No hemorrhagic or thromboembolic events occurred during clinical follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Our experience suggests that endovascular treatment of middle cerebral artery bifurcation unruptured wide-necked aneurysms with an LVIS stent is safe and effective, but the effect on branches needs to be further studied.","Yan, Yazhou; Zeng, Zhangwei; Wu, Yina; Xiong, Jiachao; Zhao, Kaijun; Hong, Bo; Xu, Yi; Liu, Jianmin; Huang, Qinghai","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",661,30

Antibodies were tethered through an engineered calmodulin (CaM)-binding peptide into a stimulus-responsive hydrogel composed of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-functionalized CaM. Macromolecular crowding is modulated by transient heating, which decreases effective pore sizes. Using a fluorescent ligand bound to the scFv, frequency-domain fluorescence spectroscopy was used to assess the structural coupling between the VH and the VL domains and relationships with functional stabilization. There is minimal structural coupling between the VH and the VL domains in solution, as is apparent from the substantial rotational mobility for the bound ligand, that is suggestive of an independent mobility for the VH and the VL domains. In comparison, the hydrogel matrix acts to structurally couple the VH and the VL domains, resulting in a reduction in rotational mobility and a retention of ligand binding in the presence of 8.0 M urea. Under these same conditions, ligand binding is disrupted for scFv antibodies in solution. Increases in the stabilization of scFv antibodies in hydrogels is not simply the result of molecular crowding because decreases in pore size act to destabilize ligand binding. Rather, our results suggest that the functional stabilization of the scFv antibody within the PEG hydrogel matrix includes important factors involving protein solvation that stabilize interdomain interactions between the VH and the VL domains necessary for ligand binding.","Xiong, Yijia; Ford, Nicole R; Hecht, Karen A; Roesijadi, Guritno; Squier, Thomas C",Bioconjugate chemistry,661,20

Over the last year, major advances have been made in the field of the introduction of herbal compounds with neuroprotective efficacy, one of which is curcumin. Curcumin (diferuloylmethane) is the most abundant turmeric component extracted from the Curcuma longa plant rhizomes. Accumulating evidence indicates that curcumin may induce mitochondrial biogenesis and can function as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic agent, which may be used effectively to treat chronic neurodegenerative diseases and any situation in which the neurodegeneration process takes place. Curcumin has been shown to play a critical role in activating two essential signaling pathways phosphatidylinositol-3(PI3)/ protein kinase B(Akt)/ glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) and PI3/Akt/cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)/brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and preventing the incidence of neurodegeneration via these two pathways. Curcumin's protective functions against neural cell degeneration due to mitochondrial dysfunction and consequent events such as oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis in neural cells have been documented and clinical data have increased to suggest that curcumin may be a standard candidate as a neuroprotective agent. Therefore, in this review, we summarized the clinical and experimental studies and interpreted the key contributory mechanisms of neuroprotective properties of curcumin in neurodegenerative diseases and disorders. We also tried to understand the function of PI3/Akt/GSK3 and PI3/Akt/CREB/BDNF signaling pathways in the neuroprotective properties of curcumin and tried to evaluate their association with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptosis and biogenesis effects of mitochondria.","Kandezi, Niyoosha; Mohammadi, Mahsa; Ghaffari, Maryam; Gholami, Mina; Motaghinejad, Majid; Safari, Sepideh",International journal of molecular and cellular medicine,661,1

The multi-epitope antigen SE protein was designed by arranging three S gene fragments (166-247 aa, S1 gene; 501-515 aa, S1 gene; 8-30 aa, S2 gene) in tandem. It was identified to be approximately 32 kDa as a His-tagged fusion protein and can bind IBV positive serum by western blot analysis. The conditions of the SE-ELISA method were optimized. The optimal concentration of the coating antigen SE was 3.689 μg/mL and the dilution of the primary antibodies was identified as 1:1000 using a checkerboard titration. The cut-off OD450 value was established at 0.332. The relative sensitivity and specificity between the SE-ELISA and IDEXX ELISA kit were 92.38 and 89.83%, respectively, with an accuracy of 91.46%.

With the advent of minimally invasive surgical techniques, patient morbidity could be reduced. However, these techniques must conform to established principles of open pancreatic surgery with regards to meticulous dissection, haemostasis and oncologic results. The robotic platform is utilized in all facets of surgery, and is being increasingly applied in pancreatic surgery. As with the introduction of any new technology, this approach must undergo rigorous examination before widespread adoption of the technique. In this article, we review the techniques and outcomes of robotic-assisted pancreatic resections, focusing on robotic-assisted pancreaticoduodenectomy, robotic-assisted distal pancreatectomy and robotic-assisted central pancreatectomy. As the outcomes of robotic-assisted surgery have yet to be rigorously evaluated against the gold standard of open surgery, this Review also highlights major laparoscopic pancreatic series in an effort to summarize the available literature on minimally invasive pancreatic surgery.","Winer, Josh; Can, Mehmet F; Bartlett, David L; Zeh, Herbert J; Zureikat, Amer H",Nature reviews.

Patients with a history of orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) at a tertiary care transplant center in Detroit, Michigan were retrospectively reviewed from March until May 2020. Clinical parameters and outcomes of 5 OHT recipients and one combined heart-lung recipient with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 were obtained. The cohort was predominately African American males with median age of 59 years (Interquartile Range, 48.25-73.25). All patients were classified as having mild-moderate disease; none required intubation or ICU admission with no deaths. The most common presenting symptoms were fever and shortness of breath 83% (n=5), followed by cough and chills 67% (n=4). All admitted patients (n=5) received hydroxychloroquine and 3 received high dose steroids. Antimetabolites were held for 2 patients (33.3%). The calcineurin inhibitor trough goal was decreased in only 1 patient; 3 other patients, without change in goal, required calcineurin inhibitor dosage reduction. Two patients requiring readmission presented 7 and 23 days after initial symptoms onset. In conclusion, our experience with OHT patients infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus did not have an elevated risk of severe infection.

This study evaluated a virtual model of care in acromegalic patients. Methods: We recruited 78 acromegalic patients, 65% female, median age 63 years. Outpatient management was remodeled to simplify access to care by (1) adoption of virtual meetings; (2) collection of blood samples at home; (3) abolishment of printed prescription and provision of electronic files directly to central pharmacy; and (4) drugs delivered to patients' home. Patients and physicians filled electronic surveys 48 h after each consultation. Results: The patients expressed satisfaction with convenience (91.1%), decreased wait time (85.1%), and saving money (79.2%) compared to face-to-face visits. Most patients felt supported by the medical team (89.1%) and kept the prescriptions updated (84.8%). The physicians reported resolutive appointments in 92.2% of cases, despite longer time to reach the patients and subsequent calls to complement missing information. Satisfaction and patient-provider relationship were maintained during the study, but the choice for virtual appointment for the next appointment fell from 78.7% to 34.8% after 6 months. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was confirmed in 13% of patients, mostly mild and moderate manifestations. Conclusion: Telemedicine is a tool for medical care in underserved populations, feasible even in low-income countries. This study suggests that it is difficult to sustain exclusive remote care for more than 6 months. The method could be adopted interchangeably with in-person consultations in acromegalic patients with stable disease.","Naves, Luciana Ansaneli; Rosa, Isabella Naves; Lima, Thomas Alves de Souza; Santana, Lidiana Bandeira de; Castro, Lucas Faria de; Casulari, Luiz Augusto",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,661,1

In our meta-analysis, we assessed the safety and efficacy of DOACs as compared to the standard treatment with warfarin in patients with AF and bioprosthetic valves. Methods We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies in the English language, and studies reporting patients with valvular heart disease that included bioprosthetic valvular disease. A systematic literature review using Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science was performed using the terms ""Direct Acting Oral Anticoagulant,"" ""Oral Anticoagulants,"" ""Non-Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulant,"" ""Atrial Fibrillation,"" ""Bioprosthetic Valve"" for literature published prior to January 2021. Extraction of data from included studies was carried out independently by three reviewers from Covidence. We assessed the methodical rigor of the included studies using the modified Downs and Black checklist. Results Four RCTs and one observational study (n=1776) were included in our study. A random-effect model using RevMan (version 5.4; The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen) was used for data analysis. The pooled data showed that there was a non-significant reduction in the incidence of stroke and systemic embolism in the patients taking DOACs as compared to warfarin (HR 0.69; 95% CI, 0.29, 1.67; I2 = 50%). The incidence of major bleeding was lower in the DOACs group; the difference was statistically significant (HR 0.42; 95% CI, 0.26, 0.67; I2 = 7%). The difference was not statistically significant for all-cause mortality in both groups (HR 1.24; 95% CI, 0.91, 1.67; I2 = 0%). Conclusion Our results showed that there was no difference in the outcomes of stroke and systemic embolism between DOACs and warfarin but there were statistically significantly lower major bleeding events.

The position statement detailed the principles for use and summarised the active efforts at the time to address barriers that limited expansion of use, such as reimbursement, liability, credentialing and patient confidentiality. The primary aim of this systematic literature review was to identify the available published literature on the application of telemedicine to neurosurgical patient care, with a specific focus on neurotrauma and emergent neurological conditions. METHODS This Level II systematic review of the literature was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2009 guidelines. Following removal of duplicates, 359 studies were yielded from database query. Following application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, 78 articles were identified for full-text review. RESULTS Full-text screening yielded a total of 11 studies for the final analysis. The study interventions took place in seven unique countries and included both developed and developing nations. Data captured spanned the years 1997 to 2019. The total cumulative number of patients who received neurosurgical telemedicine consultations captured by this review was 37,224. DISCUSSION This review of the literature suggests that telemedicine in emergent settings offers safe, feasible, and cost-reducing methods of increasing access to high acuity neurosurgical care and may serve to limit unnecessary inter-facility transfers. As infrastructure and regulatory guidelines continue to evolve, neurosurgical patients, both domestic and abroad, will benefit from improved access to expertise afforded by telemedicine technologies.","Wright, James; Elder, Theresa; Gerges, Christina; Reisen, Breanne; Wright, Christina; Jella, Tarun; Shah, Sanjit; Yang, George; Ngwenya, Laura B; Wang, Vincent; Parr, Ann M",Journal of telemedicine and telecare,661,28

A global pandemic like COVID19 poses some serious questions and challenges in the minds of practicing pediatricians as what support to offer our children, theirparents and carers-alleviating their anxiety about their child's diet and nutrition, that is critical at this time of crisis. Although the evidence for pediatric nutrition and COVID19 is not strong, this article aims to critically look into pediatric nutrition during COVID19 pandemic and bring the most recent evidence into limelight and making the right choices with pediatric nutrition. METHODS We performed a search on recent literature using the search terms ""Covid19"" + ""Children"" + ""Nutrition"" to analyze the current evidence supporting nutrition as a stimulant for covid19. A review article based on the above search results was written to highlight the importance of nutrition during this pandemic. RESULTS Strong recommendations remain unchanged for breast feeding, healthy complimentary feeding, use of supplemental formula where appropriate, Oral nutritional supplements, Zinc, n-3& n- 6 fatty acids, probiotics all have a certain role to play as a stimulant for Covid19 in children. CONCLUSION Current evidence emphasizes the use of additional nutritional supplements especially in the ""at risk"" groups, low socio-economic status and children with chronic medical problems. Paediatric nutrition should never be overlooked and ""one size does not fit all"" as every child is different and their individual nutritional needs vary.

METHODS PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were searched from their inception to October 3, 2020. Relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was used to evaluate the results. Subgroup analyses were used to assess heterogeneity. A funnel plot was used to explore publication bias. STATA was applied for all analyses. RESULTS A total of nine studies consisted of four nested case-control, two case-cohort and three cohort studies were included. The results showed that antimalarials might reduce the risk of cancer in SLE (RR = 0.68, 95%CI: 0.55-0.85). In the subgroup analysis of four nested case-control and two case-cohort studies, the pooled RR was estimated as 0.69 (95% CI: 0.60-0.80). In four studies about hydroxychloroquine, the pooled RR was estimated as 0.70 (95% CI: 0.53-0.93). Antimalarials might reduce the risk of cancer in SLE among the Asian population (RR = 0.66; 95% CI: 0.49-0.88) (I2 = 43.1%, p = .173).

In order to understand SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity and antigenic potential, and to develop therapeutic tools, it is essential to portray the full repertoire of its expressed proteins. The SARS-CoV-2 coding capacity map is currently based on computational predictions and relies on homology to other coronaviruses. Since coronaviruses differ in their protein array, especially in the variety of accessory proteins, it is crucial to characterize the specific collection of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in an unbiased and open-ended manner. Using a suite of ribosome profiling techniques2-4, we present a high-resolution map of the SARS-CoV-2 coding regions, allowing us to accurately quantify the expression of canonical viral open reading frames (ORFs) and to identify 23 unannotated viral ORFs. These ORFs include upstream ORFs (uORFs) that are likely playing a regulatory role, several in-frame internal ORFs lying within existing ORFs, resulting in N-terminally truncated products, as well as internal out-of-frame ORFs, which generate novel polypeptides. We further show that viral mRNAs are not translated more efficiently than host mRNAs; rather, virus translation dominates host translation due to high levels of viral transcripts.

In this update of each organization's guidelines, screening tests are grouped into those that primarily detect cancer early and those that can detect cancer early and also can detect adenomatous polyps, thus providing a greater potential for prevention through polypectomy. When possible, clinicians should make patients aware of the full range of screening options, but at a minimum they should be prepared to offer patients a choice between a screening test that is effective at both early cancer detection and cancer prevention through the detection and removal of polyps and a screening test that primarily is effective at early cancer detection.

Currently, there are no disease-modifying pharmacological or surgical therapies for OA. Fetal mammals, in contrast to adults, are capable of regenerating injured cartilage in the first two trimesters of gestation. A deeper understanding of the properties intrinsic to the response of fetal tissue to injury would allow us to modulate the way in which adult tissue responds to injury. In this study, we employed secretome proteomics to compare fetal and adult protein regulation in response to cartilage injury using an ovine cartilage defect model. The most relevant events comprised proteins associated with the immune response and inflammation, proteins specific for cartilage tissue and cartilage development, and proteins involved in cell growth and proliferation. Alarmins S100A8, S100A9 and S100A12 and coiled-coil domain containing 88A (CCDC88A), which are associated with inflammatory processes, were found to be significantly upregulated following injury in adult, but not in fetal animals. By contrast, cartilage-specific proteins like proteoglycan 4 were upregulated in response to injury only in fetal sheep postinjury. Our results demonstrate the power and relevance of the ovine fetal cartilage regeneration model presented here for the first time.

Future research activities should focus on solutions to these problems arising at the interface between animals and humans. A 4-fold classification of emerging zoonoses was proposed: Type 1: from wild animals to humans (Hanta); Type 1 plus: from wild animals to humans with further human-to-human transmission (AIDS); Type 2: from wild animals to domestic animals to humans (Avian flu) and Type 2 plus: from wild animals to domestic animals to humans, with further human-to-human transmission (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, SARS). The resulting holistic approach to emerging infections links microbiology, veterinary medicine, human medicine, ecology, public health and epidemiology. As emerging 'new' respiratory viruses are identified in many wild and domestic animals, issues of interspecies transmission have become of increasing concern. The development of safe and effective human and veterinary vaccines is a priority. For example, the spread of different influenza viruses has stimulated influenza vaccine development, just as the spread of Ebola and Marburg viruses has led to new approaches to filovirus vaccines. Interdisciplinary collaboration has become essential because of the convergence of human disease, animal disease and a common approach to biosecurity. High containment pathogens pose a significant threat to public health systems, as well as a major research challenge, because of limited experience in case management, lack of appropriate resources in affected areas and a limited number of animal research facilities in developed countries. Animal models that mimic certain diseases are key elements for understanding the underlying mechanisms of disease pathogenesis, as well as for the development and efficacy testing of therapeutics and vaccines. An updated veterinary curriculum is essential to empower future graduates to work in an international environment, applying international standards for disease surveillance, veterinary public health, food safety and animal welfare.","Kahn, R E; Clouser, D F; Richt, J A",Zoonoses and public health,661,1

No study has examined the clinical pathway of children on invasive LTMV in an Irish setting. Our data over a ten year period was reviewed to see if our demographics and outcomes are in line with global trends. METHODS Children's Health Ireland (CHI) at Crumlin, Dublin is Ireland's largest tertiary paediatric hospital. A retrospective review analysed data from children in our centre commenced on LTMV via a tracheostomy over ten years (2009 - 2018). This data was subdivided into two epochs for statistical analysis of longitudinal trends. RESULTS Forty-six children were commenced on LTMV from 2009 to 2018. Many had complex medical diagnoses with associated co-morbidities. Far less children, 30.4% (n = 14) commenced LTMV in the latter half of the ten year period, they also fared better in all aspects of their treatment course. Focusing solely on children who have needed LTMV over this timeframe we have been able to isolate trends specific to this cohort. Less patients commenced LTMV on a year on year basis, and for those that require tracheostomy and LTMV, their journey to decannulation tends to be shorter. CONCLUSION Over the period reviewed, less patients over time necessitated LTMV, and those patients are being weaned and decannulated with ever more success. This has implications in terms of predicting numbers transitioning to adult services and allocation of hospital and community care resources. This article is protected by copyright.

PROCEDURES HMSC were labelled with 10 Bq/cell. Cellular retention of radioactivity, cell survival, and migration were evaluated over 48 h. Metabolic activity was assessed over 14 days and the hMSC's stem cell character was evaluated. Serial SPECT/CT was performed after intra-osseous injection to athymic rats over 48 h. RESULTS Labelling efficiency was 25%, with 61% of incorporated (111)In remaining in the hMSC at 48 h. The radiolabelling was without effect on cell viability, stem cell character, and plasticity, whereas metabolic activity and migration were significantly reduced. Grafted cells could be imaged in situ with SPECT/CT. CONCLUSIONS (111)In-oxine labelling moderately impaired hMSC's functional integrity while preserving their stem cell character.

However, there is a clear gap in patient care after surgical patients are discharged from hospital, resulting in poorly controlled postoperative pain. Inadequate pain management after discharge can have detrimental effects on quality of life and lead to the development of chronic postsurgical pain. The severity of postoperative pain before discharge is well described, but less emphasis has been placed on assessing pain at home after hospital discharge. OBJECTIVE The objective of this review is to summarize the prevalence of moderate-to-severe postoperative pain within the first 1 to 14 days after hospital discharge. METHODS A detailed search of epidemiological studies investigating postoperative pain will be conducted on MEDLINE and EMBASE from their inception until the date the searches are run. The primary outcome will be the proportion of patients reporting moderate-to-severe postoperative pain at rest and with movement within the first 1 to 14 days after hospital discharge. The secondary outcomes will include a comparison of postoperative pain after discharge between patients who underwent ambulatory and inpatient surgery, and adverse outcomes attributable to poor pain control after hospital discharge (eg, readmission to hospital, emergency room or other unplanned medical visits, or a decrease in quality of life). RESULTS The protocol has been registered in PROSPERO (registration number CRD42020194346). The search strategies for MEDLINE and EMBASE have been completed. The final results are expected to be published in May 2021.

OBJECTIVE We hypothesized that 129Xe MRI is feasible and can demonstrate ventilation defects that relate to and predict clinical severity in a pediatric asthma cohort. METHODS Thirty-seven children (13 severe asthma, 8 mild/moderate asthma, 16 age-matched healthy controls) aged 6-17 years-old were imaged with 129Xe MRI. Ventilation defect percentage (VDP) and image reader score were calculated and compared to clinical measures at baseline and at follow-up. RESULTS Children with asthma had higher VDP (p=0.002) and number of defects per image slice (defects/slice) (p=0.0001) than children without asthma. Children with clinically severe asthma had significantly higher VDP and number of defects/slice than healthy controls. Children with asthma who had higher number of defects/slice had higher rate of healthcare utilization (r=0.48, p=0.03) and oral corticosteroid use (r=0.43, p=0.05) at baseline. ROC analysis demonstrated the number of defects/slice and VDP were predictive of increased healthcare utilization, asthma and severe asthma. VDP correlated with FEV1 (r=-0.35, p=0.04) and FEV1/FVC ratio (r=-0.41, p=0.01). CONCLUSION 129Xe MRI correlates with asthma severity, healthcare utilization, and oral corticosteroid use. As delineation of clinical severity is often difficult in children, 129Xe MRI may be an important biomarker for severity, with potential to identify children at higher risk for exacerbations and improve outcomes.","Lin, Nancy Y; Roach, David J; Willmering, Matthew M; Walkup, Laura L; Hossain, Md Monir; Desirazu, Priyanka; Cleveland, Zackary I; Guilbert, Theresa W; Woods, Jason C",The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,661,31

However, might there be some individuals for whom job loss may be so detrimental that they experience high levels of worry even if they view job loss as less likely? To answer this question, the present study leveraged research on future-oriented cognition to investigate profiles of cognitive and affective job insecurity (JI). We examined how economic job dependency relates to different profiles of JI experiences as well as the implications of these profiles for understanding heterogeneity in work strain. Latent profile analysis using the U.S. International Social Survey Program data set, and replicated in the U.K. data set, revealed three profiles: Employees who are secure in their role and do not worry about potential job loss (secure alignment profile), those who worry significantly about job loss despite perceiving minimal job threats (affective JI misalignment profile), and employees who worry to some extent and perceive minimal job threats (ambivalent JI alignment profile). As anticipated, several economic job dependence factors (perceived employability and education) were predictors of profile membership. Further, those in the affective JI misalignment profile reported the greatest amount of strain. We discuss our results in terms of implications for JI theory and organizational practice.

SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) surface receptor via the spike (S) receptor-binding protein (RBD) on the virus envelope. Global data on a similar infectious disease spread by SARS-CoV-1 in 2002 indicated improved stability of the virus at lower temperatures facilitating its high transmission in the community during colder months (December-February). Seasonal viral transmissions are strongly modulated by temperatures, which can impact viral trafficking into host cells; however, an experimental study of temperature-dependent activity of SARS-CoV-2 is still lacking. We mimicked SARS-CoV-2 with polymer beads coated with the SARS-CoV-2 S protein to study the effect of seasonal temperatures on the binding of virus-mimicking nanospheres to lung epithelia. The presence of the S protein RBD on nanosphere surfaces led to binding by Calu-3 airway epithelial cells via the ACE-2 receptor. Calu-3 and control fibroblast cells with S-RBD-coated nanospheres were incubated at 33 and 37 °C to mimic temperature fluctuations in the host respiratory tract, and we found no temperature dependence in contrast to nonspecific binding of bovine serum ablumin-coated nanospheres. Moreover, the ambient temperature changes from 4 to 40 °C had no effect on S-RBD-ACE-2 ligand-receptor binding and minimal effect on the S-RBD protein structure (up to 40 °C), though protein denaturing occurred at 51 °C. Our results suggest that ambient temperatures from 4 to 40 °C have little effect on the SARS-CoV-2-ACE-2 interaction in agreement with the infection data currently reported.","Kumar, Sachin; Paul, Alexandra; Chatterjee, Sayantan; Pütz, Sabine; Nehra, Natasha; Wang, Daniel S; Nisar, Arsalan; M Jennings, Christian; Parekh, Sapun H",Biointerphases,661,24

Patients with lung cancer are a particularly vulnerable population, where the risk of mortality from cancer must now be balanced by the potential risk of a life-threatening infection. In these unprecedented times, a collaborative and multidisciplinary approach is required to streamline but not compromise care. We have developed guidelines at our academic cancer center to standardize management of patients with lung cancer across our health care system and provide guidance to the larger oncology community. We recommend that general principles of lung cancer treatment continue to be followed in most cases where delays could result in rapid cancer progression.

In patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension, CSF drainage via lumbar puncture decreases intracranial pressure, which relieves the stenosis, and may provide at least temporary cessation of pulsatile tinnitus. The objective of this study was to evaluate changes in venous blood flow caused by lowered intracranial pressure in patients with pulsatile tinnitus to help identify the cause of pulsatile tinnitus. MATERIALS AND METHODS Ten patients with suspected transverse sinus stenosis as a venous etiology for pulsatile tinnitus symptoms underwent MR imaging before and after lumbar puncture in the same session. The protocol included flow assessment and rating of pulsatile tinnitus intensity before and after lumbar puncture and MR venography before lumbar puncture. Post-lumbar puncture MR venography was performed in 1 subject. RESULTS There was a lumbar puncture-induced reduction in venous peak velocity that correlated with the opening pressure (r = -0.72, P = .019) without a concomitant reduction in flow rate. Patients with flow jets had their peak velocity reduced by 0.30 ± 0.18 m/s (P = .002), correlating with a reduction in CSF pressure (r = 0.82, P = .024) and the reduction in subjectively scored pulsatile tinnitus intensity (r = 0.78, P = .023). The post-lumbar puncture MR venography demonstrated alleviation of the stenosis. CONCLUSIONS Our results show a lumbar puncture-induced reduction in venous peak velocity without a concomitant reduction in flow rate. We hypothesize that the reduction is caused by the expansion of the stenosis after lumbar puncture. Our results further show a correlation between the peak velocity and pulsatile tinnitus intensity, suggesting the flow jet to be instrumental in the development of sound.","Haraldsson, H; Leach, J R; Kao, E I; Wright, A G; Ammanuel, S G; Khangura, R S; Ballweber, M K; Chin, C T; Shah, V N; Meisel, K; Saloner, D A; Amans, M R",AJNR.

RESULTS The consensus of this group is that amotivation in mood disorders is a legitimate therapeutic target, given the magnitude of the associated unmet needs, and that proof-of-concept studies should be conducted in order to facilitate subsequent larger investigations. The focus of this manuscript is to consider the study of amotivation, as a residual symptom of major depressive disorder (MDD) or bipolar depression (BD), following adequate treatment with a typical antidepressant or mood stabiliser/antipsychotic, respectively. DISCUSSION There is a paucity of data studying amotivation in mood disorders. This manuscript provides general guidance on the most appropriate study design(s) and methodology to assess potential therapeutic options for the management of residual amotivation in mood disorders.","Calabrese, Joseph R; Fava, Maurizio; Garibaldi, George; Grunze, Heinz; Krystal, Andrew D; Laughren, Thomas; Macfadden, Wayne; Marin, Robert; Nierenberg, Andrew A; Tohen, Mauricio",Journal of affective disorders,661,23

In order to successfully reduce drug-related mortality over the long term, policymakers and public health leaders should develop partnerships with people who use drugs, incorporate harm reduction interventions, and reverse decades of drug criminalization policies. CONTEXT Drug overdose is the leading cause of injury-related death in the United States. Synthetic opioids, predominantly illicit fentanyl and its analogs, surpassed prescription opioids and heroin in associated mortality rates in 2016. Unfortunately, interventions fail to fully address the current wave of the opioid epidemic and often omit the voices of people with lived experiences regarding drug use. Every overdose death is a culmination of a long series of policy failures and lost opportunities for harm reduction. METHODS In this article, we conducted a scoping review of the opioid literature to propose a novel framework designed to foreground social determinants more directly into our understanding of this national emergency. The ""continuum of overdose risk"" framework is our synthesis of the global evidence base and is grounded in contemporary theories, models, and policies that have been successfully applied both domestically and internationally. FINDINGS De-escalating overdose risk in the long term will require scaling up innovative and comprehensive solutions that have been designed through partnerships with people who use drugs and are rooted in harm reduction. CONCLUSIONS Without recognizing the full drug-use continuum and the role of social determinants, the current responses to drug overdose will continue to aggravate the problem they are trying to solve.","Park, Ju Nyeong; Rouhani, Saba; Beletsky, Leo; Vincent, Louise; Saloner, Brendan; Sherman, Susan G",The Milbank quarterly,661,20

We previously showed that zygotic venlafaxine deposition alters larval behavior in zebrafish (Danio rerio), but the mechanisms were unknown. Here we tested the hypothesis that venlafaxine disrupts central serotonergic development, leading to impaired behavioral responses in zebrafish larvae. This was tested by microinjecting embryos with venlafaxine immediately after fertilization and performing spatial distribution of serotonin immunoreactivity, as well as characterizing target genes involved in serotonin turnover in the zebrafish brain. We provide evidence that venlafaxine exposure reduces serotonin immunoreactivity and tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cell populations in specific larval brain regions, and this corresponded with reduced larval activity observed in the drug-exposed group. Lowered serotonin was not due to either reduced synthesis or increased breakdown capacity. However, co-injection of serotonin alongside venlafaxine in embryos recovered brain serotonin immunoreactivity, tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cell populations, and rescued venlafaxine-mediated behavioral changes. Overall, our results demonstrate for the first time that early life exposure to venlafaxine perturbs brain development, which may be due to reduced serotonin, leading to altered larval behavior in zebrafish.","Thompson, William Andrew; Vijayan, Mathilakath M",Environmental science & technology,661,1

Details regarding the safety and use of tracheostomy in treating COVID-19 continue to evolve. Objective To evaluate the association of tracheostomy with COVID-19 patient outcomes and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission among health care professionals (HCPs). Data Sources EMBASE (Ovid), Medline (Ovid), and Web of Science from January 1, 2020, to March 4, 2021. Study Selection English-language studies investigating patients with COVID-19 who were receiving IMV and undergoing tracheostomy. Observational and randomized clinical trials were eligible (no randomized clinical trials were found in the search). All screening was performed by 2 reviewers (P.S. and M.L.). Overall, 156 studies underwent full-text review. Data Extraction and Synthesis We performed data extraction in accordance with Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. We used a random-effects model, and ROBINS-I was used for the risk-of-bias analysis. Main Outcomes and Measures SARS-CoV-2 transmission between HCPs and levels of personal protective equipment, in addition to complications, time to decannulation, ventilation weaning, and intensive care unit (ICU) discharge in patients with COVID-19 who underwent tracheostomy. Results Of the 156 studies that underwent full-text review, only 69 were included in the qualitative synthesis, and 14 of these 69 studies (20.3%) were included in the meta-analysis. A total of 4669 patients were included in the 69 studies, and the mean (range) patient age across studies was 60.7 (49.1-68.8) years (43 studies [62.3%] with 1856 patients). We found that in all studies, 1854 patients (73.8%) were men and 658 (26.2%) were women. We found that 28 studies (40.6%) investigated either surgical tracheostomy or percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy. Overall, 3 of 58 studies (5.17%) identified a small subset of HCPs who developed COVID-19 that was associated with tracheostomy. Studies did not consistently report the number of HCPs involved in tracheostomy. Among the patients, early tracheostomy was associated with faster ICU discharge (mean difference, 6.17 days; 95% CI, -11.30 to -1.30), but no change in IMV weaning (mean difference, -2.99 days; 95% CI, -8.32 to 2.33) or decannulation (mean difference, -3.12 days; 95% CI, -7.35 to 1.12). There was no association between mortality or perioperative complications and type of tracheostomy. A risk-of-bias evaluation that used ROBINS-I demonstrated notable bias in the confounder and patient selection domains because of a lack of randomization and cohort matching. There was notable heterogeneity in study reporting. Conclusions and Relevance The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that enhanced personal protective equipment is associated with low rates of SARS-CoV-2 transmission during tracheostomy. Early tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19 may reduce ICU stay, but this finding is limited by the observational nature of the included studies.","Staibano, Phillip; Levin, Marc; McHugh, Tobial; Gupta, Michael; Sommer, Doron D",JAMA otolaryngology-- head & neck surgery,661,2

Use of fewer and smaller incisions during laparoscopy may be expected to further minimize these risks. Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS), or single incision laparoscopy, describes the use of one small skin incision to complete laparoscopic surgical procedures.

Consequently, many governments have implemented lockdowns on a national level, affecting, among others, ophthalmic surgical practice in a globe scale.Background: The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of surgical theatre lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic on the surgical performance of cataract surgeons.Methods: Intraoperative complications and surgical time of the first 160 cataract surgeries performed by eight consultants (20 cases each) after a two-month lockdown were recorded and analysed in a cross-sectional study. The results were plotted against the last 30 cases of each surgeon before the implementation of the lockdown (240 cases). Cataract surgeons were asked to rate their subjective perspective and difficulties faced after re-opening through a questionnaire.Results: The average duration of all surgeries after the lockdown was 19.1 ± 6.2 minutes showing a 14% increase compared to the one before the lockdown (16.8 ± 5.1 minutes, p = 0.0001). The complications rate was 2.09% (5/240 cases) before the abstention and 3.12% (5/160 cases) after the abstention not yielding any statistically significant difference (p = 0.74). When complicated surgeries were excluded from the analysis, surgical time was still higher after the lockdown (18.9 ± 5.9 minutes) than before (16.6 ± 5.0 minutes, p < 0.0001). 37.5% of consultants (3/8) stated that the two-month abstention from cataract surgeries has affected their surgical skills somewhat or a lot, while 62.5% (5/8) reported being more careful in their first cases after the lockdown. Most complications occurred in the hands of one surgeon who stated to be very anxious upon restart.Conclusion: The operating theatres' lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic did not seem to affect the intraoperative complications rate in cataract surgery. A slight increase of surgical duration was noted, while most surgeons reported being more careful upon restart.","Tzamalis, Argyrios; Karafotaki, Kyriaki; Karipidi, Kalliopi; Diafas, Asterios; Mataftsi, Asimina; Tsinopoulos, Ioannis; Ziakas, Nikolaos",Clinical & experimental optometry,661,1

METHODS AND RESULTS The heterotrophic bacterial strain in symbiotic association with intertidal macroalga H. valentiae was isolated to homogeneity in a culture-dependent method and screened for bioactivities by spot-over-lawn assay. The bacterial organic extract was purified and characterized by extensive chromatographic and spectroscopic methods, respectively, and was assessed for antibacterial activities with disc diffusion and microtube dilution methods. The macrocyclic polyketide compounds exhibited wide-spectrum of anti-infective potential against clinically significant vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VREfs), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumonia with minimum inhibitory concentration of about 1-3 µg mL-1 , insomuch as the antibiotics chloramphenicol and ampicillin were active at ≥ 6.25 µg mL-1 . The studied compounds unveiled Fe3+ chelating activity, which designated that their prospective anti-infective activities against the pathogens could be due to their siderophore mechanism of action. In support of that, the bacterium exhibited siderophore production on bioassay involving the cast upon culture agar plate, and the presence of siderophore biosynthetic gene (≈1000 bp) (MF 981936). In silico molecular modeling with penicillin-binding protein (PBP2a) coded by mecA genes of MRSA (docking score 11.68-12.69 kcal mol-1 ) verified their in vitro antibacterial activities. Putative biosynthetic pathway of macrocyclic polyketides through stepwise decarboxylative condensation initiated by malonate-acyl carrier protein further validated their structural and molecular attributes.

Inflammation is an essential component for glial scar formation. Previous study has shown that adjudin, a potential Sirt3 activator, could attenuate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and stroke-induced neuroinflammation. To investigate the potential inhibitory effect and mechanism of adjudin on astrocyte activation, we used a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) model with or without adjudin treatment in wild type (WT) and Sirt3 knockout (KO) mice and performed a wound healing experiment in vitro. Both our in vivo and in vitro results showed that adjudin reduced astrocyte activation by upregulating Sirt3 expression. In addition, adjudin treatment after stroke promoted functional and neurovascular recovery accompanied with the decreased area of glial scar in WT mice, which was blunted by Sirt3 deficiency. Furthermore, adjudin could increase Foxo3a and inhibit Notch1 signaling pathway via Sirt3. Both the suppression of Foxo3a and overexpression of N1ICD could alleviate the inhibitory effect of adjudin in vitro indicating that Sirt3-Foxo3a and Sirt3-Notch1 signaling pathways were involved in the inhibitory effect of adjudin in wound healing experiment.","Yang, Xiao; Geng, Keyi; Zhang, Jinfan; Zhang, Yanshuang; Shao, Jiaxiang; Xia, Weiliang",Frontiers in pharmacology,661,0

Referring to serum cortisol, it has been proposed to contribute to the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome, and it has been demonstrated that weight loss normalizes cortisol levels and improves insulin resistance. The aims of this study were to analyze CRP and cortisol levels pre- and postoperatively in morbidly obese patients undergoing a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and to correlate them with weight loss and parameters associated with cardiovascular risk. METHODS A prospective study of all the morbidly obese patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy as bariatric procedure between October 2007 and May 2011 was performed. RESULTS A total of 40 patients were included in the study. CRP levels decreased significantly 12 months after surgery (median reduction of 8.9 mg/l; p = 0.001). Serum cortisol levels decreased significantly 6 months after surgery (median reduction of 34.9 μg/dl; p = 0.001). CRP values reached the normal range (<5 mg/l) 1 year after surgery. Referring to cortisol, a significant association was observed with the cardiovascular risk predictor (triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio) from the 6th month after surgery onward (Pearson correlation coefficient, 0.559; p = 0.008).

These pathogens include zoonotic bacteria (Leptospira interrogans, Yersina pestis, Rickettsia typhi, Bartonella spp., Streptobacillus moniliformis), viruses (Seoul hantavirus), and parasites (Angiostrongylus cantonensis). A more complete understanding of the ecology of these pathogens in people and rats is critical for determining the public health risks associated with urban rats and for developing strategies to monitor and mitigate those risks. Although the ecology of rat-associated zoonoses is complex, due to the multiple ways in which rats, people, pathogens, vectors, and the environment may interact, common determinants of human disease can still be identified. This review summarizes the ecology of zoonoses associated with urban rats with a view to identifying similarities, critical differences, and avenues for further study.","Himsworth, Chelsea G; Parsons, Kirbee L; Jardine, Claire; Patrick, David M",Vector borne and zoonotic diseases,661,1

It will augment previously published small series of autopsy case reports, refine clinicopathologic considerations, and improve the accuracy of future vital statistical reporting. OBJECTIVE To accurately reflect the pre-existing diseases and pathologic conditions of decedents with Sars-CoV-2 infection through autopsy. DESIGN Comprehensive data from 135 autopsy evaluations of COVID-19-positive decedents is presented, including histologic assessment. Postmortem examinations were performed by 36 pathologists at 19 medical centers or forensic institutions in the United States and Brazil. Data from each autopsy were collected through the online submission of multiple choice and openended survey responses. RESULTS Patients dying of or with COVID-19 had an average of 8.89 pathologic conditions documented at autopsy, spanning a combination of prior chronic disease and acute conditions acquired during hospitalization. Virtually all decedents were cited as having more than one preexisting condition, encompassing an average of 2.88 such diseases each. Clinical conditions during terminal hospitalization were cited 395 times for the 135 autopsied decedents and predominantly encompassed acute failure of multiple organ systems and/or impaired coagulation. Myocarditis was rarely cited. CONCLUSIONS Cause-of-death statements in both autopsy reports and death certificates may not encompass the severity or spectrum of co-morbid conditions in those dying of or with COVID-19. If supported by additional research, this finding may have implications for public health decisions and reporting moving forward through the pandemic.","Hooper, Jody E; Padera, Robert F; Dolhnikoff, Marisa; da Silva, Luiz Fernando Ferraz; Duarte-Neto, Amaro Nunes; Kapp, Meghan E; Lacy, J Matthew; Mauad, Thais; Nascimento Saldiva, Paulo Hilario; Rapkiewicz, Amy V; Wolf, Dwayne A; Felix, Juan C; Benson, Paul; de Almeida Monteiro, Renata Aparecida; Shanes, Elisheva; Gawelek, Kara L; Marshall, Desiree A; McDonald, Michelle M; Muller, William; Priemer, David S; Solomon, Isaac H; Zak, Taylor; Bhattacharjee, Meenakshi B; Fu, Lucy; Gilbert, Andrea R; Harper, Holly L; Litovsky, Silvio; Lomasney, Jon; Mount, Sharon L; Reilly, Stephanie; Sekulic, Miroslav; Steffensen, Thora S; Threlkeld, Kirsten J; Zhao, Bihong; Williamson, Alex K",Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,661,31

The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of COVID-19 on university students' dietary intake, physical activity and sedentary behaviour. Participants were students (n=125) from the Universities of Saskatchewan and Regina. An online questionnaire was administered retrospectively (for pre-pandemic) and prospectively (during the pandemic) to examine students' dietary intake, physical activity and sedentary behaviour. Overall, nutrient and caloric intakes were significantly reduced (p<0.05) during the pandemic, and alcohol intake increased (p=0.03). Before the pandemic, 16% and 54% of the participants were meeting the Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines for Adults (18-64 years) of 150 minutes of moderate-vigorous physical activity and 8 hours or less of sedentary activity respectively. Only 10% met the guidelines for physical activity while 30% met the guidelines for sedentary behaviour during the pandemic. The minutes per week spent engaging in moderate to vigorous physical activity during the pandemic decreased by approximately 20% (p<0.001). The hours spent in sedentary activities increased by 3 hours per day (p<0.001). Our findings confirm that during the pandemic, students' inadequate dietary intake, high alcohol consumption, low physical activity and high sedentary behaviour were significantly compounded. Novelty • During COVID-19, the nutrient and caloric intakes of university students decreased, and alcohol intake increased significantly. • University students' physical activity levels decreased, and sedentary activity increased significantly during COVID-19. • During COVID-19 students did not engage in sufficient physical activity to offset the increased sedentary behaviour.","Bertrand, Leandy; Shaw, Keely; Ko, Jongbum; Deprez, Dalton; Chilibeck, Philip D; Zello, Gordon A","Applied physiology, nutrition, and metabolism = Physiologie appliquee, nutrition et metabolisme",661,26

Laparoscopic appendectomy has significant benefits in obese patients. However, morbid obesity can be accepted as an exclusion criterion for natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES). Here, we present a transvaginal appendectomy in a 66-year-old morbidly obese (BMI 36 kg/m(2), ASA III) patient. Case and Technique. Acute appendicitis was suspected based on history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and ultrasound findings. During laparoscopic surgery, a 5 mm trocar was inserted through the umbilicus and a 5 mm telescope was placed. A 12 mm trocar and a 5 mm grasper were inserted separately through the posterior fornix of the vagina under laparoscopic guidance. The appendix was divided with an endoscopic stapler through the transvaginal 12 mm trocar and removed from the same trocar. The operating time was 75 minutes with minimal blood loss (<10 mL). The patient was discharged 16 hours after surgery uneventfully and she did not require any analgesic administration. Conclusion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first clinical case that focuses on the transvaginal appendectomy at morbid obesity. We can say that morbid obesity does not constitute an obstacle for treatment of acute appendicitis by transvaginal endoscopic surgery.","Yagci, Mehmet Ali; Kayaalp, Cuneyt; Ates, Mustafa",Case reports in surgery,661,9

It has been hypothesized that the human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) enzyme receptor may be a functional target for the spike proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Since DPP4-inhibitors are currently used for the treatment of patients with type-2 diabetes (T2DM), there is currently high interest in the possibility that these agents, or incretin-based therapies (IBTs) in general, may be of benefit against the new coronavirus infection. Diabetes is associated with increased COVID-19 severity and mortality, and accumulating evidence suggests that IBTs may favorably alter the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection due to their inherent mechanisms of action. Further research into prognostic variables associated with various antidiabetic treatment regimens, and in particular the IBT, in patients with T2DM affected by the COVID-19 pandemic is therefore warranted.","Stoian, Anca Pantea; Papanas, Nikolaos; Prazny, Martin; Rizvi, Ali A; Rizzo, Manfredi",Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology and therapeutics,661,1

Preliminary evidence suggests that cyanoacrylate embolization (CAE) may be effective in the treatment of incompetent great saphenous veins (GSVs). We report herein early results of a randomized trial of CAE vs radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for the treatment of symptomatic incompetent GSVs. METHODS Two hundred twenty-two subjects with symptomatic GSV incompetence were randomly assigned to receive either CAE (n = 108) with the VenaSeal Sapheon Closure System (Sapheon, Inc, Morrisville, NC) or RFA (n = 114) with the ClosureFast system (Covidien, Mansfield, Mass). After discharge, subjects returned to the clinic on day 3 and again at months 1 and 3. The study's primary end point was closure of the target vein at month 3 as assessed by duplex ultrasound and adjudicated by an independent vascular ultrasound core laboratory. Statistical testing focused on showing noninferiority with a 10% delta conditionally followed by superiority testing. No adjunctive procedures were allowed until after the month 3 visit, and missing month 3 data were imputed by various methods. Secondary end points included patient-reported pain during vein treatment and extent of ecchymosis at day 3. Additional assessments included general and disease-specific quality of life surveys and adverse event rates. RESULTS All subjects received the assigned intervention. By use of the predictive method for imputing missing data, 3-month closure rates were 99% for CAE and 96% for RFA. All primary end point analyses, which used various methods to account for the missing data rate (14%), showed evidence to support the study's noninferiority hypothesis (all P < .01); some of these analyses supported a trend toward superiority (P = .07 in the predictive model). Pain experienced during the procedure was mild and similar between treatment groups (2.2 and 2.4 for CAE and RFA, respectively, on a 10-point scale; P = .11). At day 3, less ecchymosis in the treated region was present after CAE compared with RFA (P < .01). Other adverse events occurred at a similar rate between groups and were generally mild and well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS CAE was proven to be noninferior to RFA for the treatment of incompetent GSVs at month 3 after the procedure. Both treatment methods showed good safety profiles. CAE does not require tumescent anesthesia and is associated with less postprocedure ecchymosis.","Morrison, Nick; Gibson, Kathleen; McEnroe, Scott; Goldman, Mitchel; King, Ted; Weiss, Robert; Cher, Daniel; Jones, Andrew",Journal of vascular surgery,661,20

During these sessions, participants completed individual and group reflection exercises where they were asked questions about their experiences during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants who volunteered submitted their responses through an electronic survey application. Anonymous responses were coded using thematic analysis to address the research questions. RESULTS Sixty-eight and 38 participants, respectively, attended the 2 networking discussions. Participant-identified professional impacts of the COVID-19 crisis included unexpected learning experiences, greater adaptability, workflow and learning interruptions, and decreased productivity. Personal impacts included a greater focus on well-being, physical and social isolation, and changes in travel plans. Participants noted positive and negative emotions including acceptance, encouragement, anxiety, stress, and frustration. The main lessons learned focused on adaptability, gratitude, and empathy.

EUS-FNA is frequently used for tissue-based diagnoses such as lymphatic diseases (ranging from tuberculosis / sarcoidosis to malignant lymphoma) or solid tumors (such as pancreatic carcinoma, neuroendocrine tumors, sub-epithelial gastrointestinal tumors and others). Outcomes of EUS-FNA results, however, vary which is caused by several different factors ranging from experience of the endoscopist over technical factors such as use of stylet or suction for puncture through the skills of the cyto-pathologist who takes care of the specimen obtained by EUS-FNA. Though introduced since more than 20 years ago EUS-FNA has still not yet been perfectionized and several issues remain controversial among endoscopist. These issues include needle size and type (FNA versus TNB needles), use of a stylet and suction for FNA sampling, pure cytologic assessment versus cyto-histologic techniques, grading of the investigator´s and pathologist´s experience and improvement of EUS training for novices. In this report we briefly review the actual literature and summarize the available evidence on some controversely discussed issues. The results support the view that use of a stylet rarely aids to increase the amount of tissue obtained during EUS-FNA, whereas use of suction can be helpful in certain situations. Novel cutting needles may potentially improve number and size of core biopsies that can be rendered for special histologic tissue processing techniques. An in-room-cytopathologist not necessarily improves outcome of EUS-FNA results but may have a role during build-up of EUS units to become more successful. EUS-FNA education requires skilled endoscopists on both sides and can presumably be improved by objective testing of practical expertise by peer review and introducing objective sampling parameters. Novel techniques and equipment are about to evolve in the near future.","Hollerbach, S; Juergensen, C; Hocke, M; Freund, U; Wellmann, A; Burmester, E",Zeitschrift fur Gastroenterologie,661,1

They play key roles in numerous cellular processes, including transcription, splicing, miRNA biogenesis and translation. Though their sequences are highly conserved, these helicases have quite diverse roles in the cell. Interestingly, often these helicases display contradictory actions in terms of the support and/or clearance of invading viruses. Increasing evidence highlights the importance of these enzymes, however, little is known about the structural basis of viral RNA recognition by the members of the DEAD-box family.

This study aimed to investigate the role of lipid rafts in the early stage of EV71 Infection. METHODS The effect of cholesterol depletion or addition of exogenous cholesterol was detected by immunofluorescence assays and quantitative real-time PCR. Effects of cholesterol depletion on the association of EV71 with lipid rafts were determined by flow cytometry and co-immunoprecipitation assays. Localization and internalization of EV71 and its receptor were assayed by confocal microscpoy and sucrose gradient analysis. The impact of cholesterol on the activation of phosphoinositide 3'-kinase/Akt signaling pathway during initial virus infection was analyzed by Western-blotting. RESULTS Disruption of membrane cholesterol by a pharmacological agent resulted in a significant reduction in the infectivity of EV71. The inhibitory effect could be reversed by the addition of exogenous cholesterol. Cholesterol depletion post-infection did not affect EV71 infection. While virus bound equally to cholesterol-depleted cells, EV71 particles failed to be internalized by cholesterol-depleted cells. EV71 capsid protein co-localized with cholera toxin B, a lipid-raft-dependent internalization marker.

The disproportionate and growing overrepresentation of Hispanic people receiving a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates the need to focus public health prevention efforts on these communities.","Rodriguez, Fatima; Coquet, Jean; Harrington, Robert; Hernandez-Boussard, Tina",Public health reports,661,31

Understanding the interspecies host-pathogen protein-protein interactions could lead to the development of novel strategies to combat infectious diseases through the rapid development of new therapeutics. The first step in understanding the host-pathogen crosstalk is to identify interacting proteins in order to define crucial hot-spots in the host-pathogen interactome, such as the proposed pharmaceutical targets by means of high-throughput proteomic methodologies. In order to obtain holistic insight into the inter- and intra-species bimolecular interactions, apart from the proteomic approach, sophisticated in silico modeling is used to correlate the obtained large data sets with other omics data and clinical outcomes. Since the main focus in this area has been directed towards human medicine, it is time to extrapolate the existing expertise to a new emerging field: the 'systems veterinary medicine'. Therefore, this review addresses high-throughput mass spectrometry-based technology for monitoring protein-protein interactions in vitro and in vivo and discusses pathogen cultivation, model host cells and available bioinformatic tools employed in vaccine development.","Horvatić, Anita; Kuleš, Josipa; Guillemin, Nicolas; Galan, Asier; Mrljak, Vladimir; Bhide, Mangesh",Molecular bioSystems,661,1

The original diagnostic criteria, which weigh each test equally, have not been validated. Limited sensitivity and specificity for biopsy and angiography are recognized. We systematically reviewed results of diagnostic tests performed in patients with an ultimate diagnosis of PCNSV. Methods We searched the OVID Medline database and bibliographies for original cases of PCNSV. We recorded demographics, diagnostic tests used, and assessed agreement between angiography and biopsy when both tests were performed. We also recorded MRI and CSF results. Results We found 701 original cases with PCNSV diagnosed with angiography or pathology. A total of 269 patients (38.4%) had both cerebral angiography and histopathologic testing (biopsy/postmortem). Classic angiographic features of vasculitis were associated with pathologic confirmation in just 32 patients (4.6%). Seventy-four patients (10.6%) with any abnormality on angiography had a normal biopsy, and 99 patients (14.1%) with abnormal biopsies had normal angiography. Brain MRI was abnormal in 505/541 patients (93.3%) and CSF was abnormal in 360/484 patients (74.4%). Increasing use of angiography and decreasing histopathologic testing were found over time. Conclusions Cerebral angiography and pathologic tissue examination were undertaken in a minority of published cases with a diagnosis of PCNSV. When both diagnostic tests were performed, disagreement between them was more than 5 times more likely than agreement. Diagnostic criteria for PCNSV may require revision to classify the clinical, pathologic, and radiologic features of this condition more accurately.","McVerry, Ferghal; McCluskey, Gavin; McCarron, Peter; Muir, Keith W; McCarron, Mark O",Neurology.

METHODS This is a retrospective analysis of a prospective single tertiary care centre 14-year cohort of patients with LVO in the anterior circulation and NIHSS score ≤ 5 on admission. Outcome was analysed according to primary intended therapy. RESULTS Among 185 patients (median age 67.4 years), 52.4% received primary conservative therapy (including 26.8% secondary reperfusion in case of secondary neurological deterioration), 12.4% IV thrombolysis (IVT) only and 35.1% primary endovascular therapy (EVT). 95 (51.4%) patients experienced neurological deterioration until 3 months. Primary-IVT-only and primary-EVT compared to conservative-therapy patients had better 3 months' outcome (54.5% vs. 30.8%: adjustedOR 6.02; adjustedp = 0.004 for mRS 0-1 and 54.7% vs. 30.8%: adjustedOR 5.09; adjustedp = 0.002, respectively). Also mRS shift analysis favored primary-IVT-only and primary-EVT patients (adjustedOR 6.25; adjustedp = 0.001 and adjustedOR 3.14; adjustedp = 0.003). Outcome in primary-IVT-only vs. primary-EVT patients did not differ significantly. Patients who received secondary EVT because of neurological deterioration after primary-conservative-therapy had worse 3 months' outcome than primary-EVT patients (20.8% vs. 30.8%: adjustedOR 0.24; adjustedp = 0.047 for mRS 0-1 and adjustedOR 0.31; adjustedp = 0.019 in mRS shift analysis). Survival and symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage did not differ amongst groups. CONCLUSIONS Our data indicate that primary IVT and/or EVT may be better than primary conservative therapy in patients with LVO in the anterior circulation and low NIHSS score. Furthermore, primary EVT was better than secondary EVT in case of neurological deterioration. There is an unmet need for RCTs to find the optimal therapy for this patient group.","Heldner, Mirjam R; Chaloulos-Iakovidis, Panagiotis; Panos, Leonidas; Volbers, Bastian; Kaesmacher, Johannes; Dobrocky, Tomas; Mordasini, Pasquale; El-Koussy, Marwan; Gralla, Jan; Arnold, Marcel; Fischer, Urs; Mattle, Heinrich P; Jung, Simon",Journal of neurology,661,5

The purpose of this study was to use an ex vivo bovine liver model to perform magnetic resonance (MR) volumetry of the visible tissue signal change induced by RFA and to correlate the MR measurement with the actual macroscopic volume measured in the dissected specimens. MATERIALS AND METHODS Sixty-four liver specimens cut from 16 bovine livers were ablated under constant simulated, close physiological conditions with target volumes set to 14.14 ml (3-cm lesion) and 65.45 ml (5-cm lesion). Four commercially available radiofrequency (RF) systems were tested (n=16 for each system; n=8 for 3 cm and n=8 for 5 cm). A T1-weighted turbo spin echo (TSE) sequence with inversion recovery and a proton-density (PD)-weighted TSE sequence were acquired in a 1.0-T open magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system. After manual dissection, actual macroscopic ablation diameters were measured and volumes calculated. MR volumetry was performed using a semiautomatic software tool. To validate the correctness and feasibility of the volume formula in macroscopic measurements, MR multiplanar reformation diameter measurements with subsequent volume calculation and semiautomatic MR volumes were correlated. RESULTS Semiautomatic MR volumetry yielded smaller volumes than manual measurement after dissection, irrespective of RF system used, target lesion size, and MR sequence. For the 3-cm lesion, only 43.3% (T1) and 41.5% (PD) of the entire necrosis are detectable. For the 5-cm lesion, only 40.8% (T1) and 37.2% (PD) are visualized in MRI directly after intervention. The correlation between semiautomatic MR volumes and calculated MR volumes was 0.888 for the T1-weighted sequence and 0.875 for the PD sequence. CONCLUSION After correlation of semiautomatic MR volumes and calculated MR volumes, it seems reasonable to use the respective volume formula for macroscopic volume calculation. Hyperacute MRI after ex vivo intervention may result in the underestimation of the real expansion of the produced necrosis zone. This must be kept in mind when using MRI for validating ablation success directly after RFA. One reason for the discrepancy between macroscopic and MRI appearance immediately after RFA may be that the transitional zone shows no or only partially visible MR signal change.","Rathke, Hendrik; Hamm, Bernd; Guettler, Felix; Lohneis, Philipp; Stroux, Andrea; Suttmeyer, Britta; Jonczyk, Martin; Teichgräber, Ulf; de Bucourt, Maximilian",Biomedizinische Technik.

Usually computed tomographic (CT) guidance is used for the procedure, thus enabling needle placement and permitting evaluation of complications such as pneumothorax and bleeding. (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) is generally used for tumor activity assessment and is therefore useful in follow-up after tumor treatment. A method that provides real-time image-based monitoring of RFA to ensure complete tumor ablation would be a valuable tool. In this report, we describe the behavior of preinjected FDG during PET CT-guided RFA of a non-small-cell lung carcinoma and discuss the value of FDG as a tool to provide intraprocedure monitor ablation. The size and the form of the activity changed during ablation. Ablation led to increase of the size and blurring and irregularity of the contour compared to pretreatment imaging. The maximal standardized uptake value decreased only slightly during the procedure. Therefore, before RFA, FDG PET can guide initial needle placement, but it does not serve as a monitoring tool to evaluate residual viable tissue during the procedure.","Schoellnast, Helmut; Larson, Steven M; Nehmeh, Sadek A; Carrasquillo, Jorge A; Thornton, Raymond H; Solomon, Stephen B",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,661,1

A comparison with the results from same-day slope-intercept GFR (SI-GFR) was also performed. METHODS Data from patients referred for GFR assessment to inform the management of chronic kidney disease at the Royal Free Hospital were reviewed. Four-sample SI-GFR calculation with samples at 2-, 4-, 6-, and 24-h post-injection was taken as the reference measurement to which the Gref and Karp SS-GFR (24-h sample) and same-day SI-GFR (2- and 4-h samples) were compared. The effect of protein binding on GFR accuracy was modelled. RESULTS A total of 43 GFR examinations with reference GFR less than 25 mL/min/1.73 m were included in the analysis. Bland-Altman analysis gave mean differences of 0.4 mL/min/1.73 m (95% confidence interval: 0-0.7) for SS-GFR (24 h) and 3.0 mL/min/1.73 m (95% confidence interval: 1.9-4.2) for same-day SI-GFR. 95% limits of agreement were -2.0 to 2.8 mL/min/1.73 m for SS-GFR (24 h) and -4.0 to 10.1 mL/min/1.73 m for same-day SI-GFR. CONCLUSIONS SS-GFR with a 24-h sample is more accurate than same-day SI-GFR in patients with GFR less than 25 mL/min/1.73 m. Using SS-GFR with a 24-h sample in routine clinical practice will result in clinically insignificant differences in GFR result compared with the reference technique, whereas a same-day SI-GFR measurement could cause large inaccuracies.","McMeekin, Helena; Wickham, Fred; Fongenie, Ben; Burniston, Maria",Nuclear medicine communications,661,15

Although considerable research on sexual selection has focused on structurally coloured plumage ornaments, the proximate mechanisms of their potential condition-dependence, and thus their honesty, is rarely addressed, particularly in an experimental context. Blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus) nestlings have UV-blue structurally coloured tail feathers, providing a unique opportunity for investigation of the causes of variation in their colour. Here, we examined the influence of early growing conditions on reflectance and structural properties of UV-blue coloured tail feathers of blue tit nestlings. We applied a two-stage brood size manipulation to determine which stage of development more strongly impacts the quality of tail feather colouration and microstructure. We used small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and electron microscopy to characterize nano- and micro-scale structure of tail feather barbs. Nestlings from the broods enlarged at a later stage of growth showed a sex-specific rectrix development delay, with males being more sensitive to this manipulation. Contrary to predictions, treatment affected neither the quality of the barb's nanostructures nor the brightness and UV chroma of feathers. However, at the micro-scale, barb's keratin characteristics were impaired in late-enlarged broods. Our results suggest that nanostructure quality, which determines UV-blue colour in tail feathers, is not sensitive to early rearing conditions. Furthermore, availability of resources during feather growth seems to impact the quality of feather microstructure more than body condition, which is likely determined at an earlier stage of nestling growth.","Janas, Katarzyna; Łatkiewicz, Anna; Parnell, Andrew; Lutyk, Dorota; Barczyk, Julia; Shawkey, Matthew D; Gustafsson, Lars; Cichoń, Mariusz; Drobniak, Szymon M",The Journal of experimental biology,661,1

However, the chronology of these effects is not yet fully understood. This study aimed to establish the early sequential effects of heat stress in bull sperm quality. Semen and blood samples of Nellore breed bulls were collected and distributed into control and testicular heat stress (scrotal bags/96 h) groups. Semen samples were evaluated for sperm motility, abnormalities, plasma membrane integrity, acrosomal membrane integrity, mitochondrial membrane potential, sperm lipid peroxidation, seminal plasma lipid peroxidation, and DNA fragmentation. Blood plasma was also evaluated for lipid peroxidation. An increase in sperm abnormalities was observed 7 days following heat stress. After 14 days, sperm lipid peroxidation increased and mitochondrial membrane function, sperm motility, and plasma membrane integrity decreased. Heat stress effects were still observed after 21 days following heat stress. An increase in sperm DNA fragmentation was observed as a late effect after 28 days. Thus, the initial effects of heat stress (i.e., increasing sperm abnormalities and lipid peroxidation) suggest the presence of oxidative stress in the semen that alters mitochondrial function, sperm motility, plasma membrane integrity, and belatedly, DNA fragmentation. Although sperm abnormalities persisted and increased over time, sperm lipid peroxidation, in turn, increased only until 21 days after heat stress. In this regard, these findings provide a greater understanding of the chronological effects of experimentally induced heat stress on bovine sperm, providing valuable insights about spermatogenesis during the first 28 days following heat stress.","Garcia-Oliveros, Laura Nataly; de Arruda, Rubens Paes; Batissaco, Leonardo; Gonzaga, Vitor Hugo Guilger; Nogueira, Vinícius José Moreira; Florez-Rodriguez, Shirley Andrea; Almeida, Flávia Dos Santos; Alves, Maíra Bianchi Rodrigues; Pinto, Sâmara Cristine Costa; Nichi, Marcilio; Losano, João Diego de Agostini; Kawai, Giulia Kiyomi Vechiato; Celeghini, Eneiva Carla Carvalho",International journal of biometeorology,661,31

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is associated with systemic inflammation, and conditions associated with MetS, such as obesity, are associated with difficulty in attaining minimal disease activity (MDA) in individuals with inflammatory arthritis. This systematic review aims to determine whether there is an increased prevalence of MetS in PsA populations compared with PsO and RA populations. METHODS A systematic review was conducted to assess the prevalence of MetS in PsA, PsO, and RA populations following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. The quality of the studies reviewed was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Checklist for Prevalence Studies. RESULTS The pooled prevalence of MetS in PsA populations was 0.46 ± 0.06 (95% CI 0.40-0.51). In comparison, the prevalence of MetS in PsO and RA populations was 0.34 ± 0.03 (95% CI 0.32-0.37) and 0.31 ± 0.04 (95% CI 0.27-0.35), respectively.

CONCLUSION The prevalence of MetS is significantly increased in PsA populations compared with PsO and RA populations. Further studies should be performed using a standardized definition of MetS in PsA, RA, and PsO populations to determine whether addressing the metabolic components in MetS offers any therapeutic benefits and in terms of attaining MDA and improving cardiovascular health.","Loganathan, Aravinthan; Kamalaraj, Narainraj; El-Haddad, Carlos; Pile, Kevin",International journal of rheumatic diseases,661,33

The objective of the study is to examine and compare rates of utilization of mental health services by AA specifically in the Riverside County setting. This study utilizes data on patients' ethnicity, age, gender, and diagnosis as collected annually by the Riverside County Department of Mental Health from the fiscal year of 2017-2018. It compares the prevalence of psychiatric disorders and the rate of utilization of mental health services by AA in the county to the data collected by the NLAAS. The total number of AA using mental health services in Riverside County is 669, which totals 1.73% of all individuals accessing the same services. The number of AA using mental health services represented 0.45% of the total AA population in Riverside County. AA in Riverside County are utilizing MH services even less than the national rates (0.45% vs 8.6% nationally from NLAAS data). The gap in care illustrated by these results exemplifies not only the disparity in utilization of MH services seen in this particular ethnic group, but portrays the stagnant results from Riverside County s attempts to address this issue. Possible reasons for the disparity include lack of access, stigma, recovery, migration, and a lack of culturally-competent care. A reimagined outreach initiative may help to better address this issue.

Forty-five dogs with macro- or microscopic tumors in specified localizations were evaluated. Depending on body weight, 0.8-2 ml contrast agent (iohexol) was injected into four quadrants around the tumor, and CT-images were obtained at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 minutes post-injection. Attenuation of chosen regions of interest (Hounsfield units (HU)) and patterns of enhancement were assessed for 284 lymph nodes in the precontrast study with median HUs of 31.1 (Interquartile range (IQR) = 18.4) and for 275 in the intravenous postcontrast study with 104.3 HU (IQR = 31.2) (paired Wilcoxon test, P < 0.001).

We hypothesized that infarct size variability induced by coronary artery ligation might be caused by coronary artery branching pattern. Coronary artery angiography was performed in 50 normal Lewis rats and in chronic myocardial infarction models in which coronary artery was ligated immediately below the left atrial appendage or 2mm distal to the left atrial appendage (n = 25 for each), followed by histological analysis. Unlike the human, the rats had a single major septal artery arising from the proximal part of the left coronary artery (n = 30) or right coronary artery (n = 20). There were three branching patterns of left circumflex artery (LCX): 33 (66%) had LCX branching peripherally from a long left main coronary artery (LMCA), while the remainder 17 (34%) had the LCX branching from the proximal part of the septal artery or a short LMCA. The rats with distal coronary ligation presented myocardial infarction localized to an anterior territory irrespective of LCX branching pattern. In the rats with proximal coronary ligation, 64% (n = 16) had broad myocardial infarction involving the anterior and lateral territories, while the remainder (36%, n = 9) had myocardial infarction localized to an anterior territory with the intact LCX arising proximally from a short LMCA. The interventricular septum was spared from infarction in all rats because of its anatomical location.

In addition, arm kinematics features are classically used to infer the content of motor planning for the execution and the control of arm movements. The present study aimed to disentangle the conflicting role of APAs during an arm-pointing task in which the subjects reach a central diode that suddenly turns on, while their postural stability was manipulated. Three postures were applied: Standing (Up), Sit without feet support (SitUnsup) and Sit with feet support (SitSup). We found that challenging postural stability induced an increase of the reaction time and movement duration (observed for the SitUnsup compared to SitSUp and Up) as well as modified the upper-limb velocity profile. Indeed, a greater max velocity and a shorter deceleration time were observed under the highest stability (SitSup). Thus, these Kinematics features reflect less challenging task and simple motor plan when the body is stabilized. Concerning the APAs, we observed the presence of them independently of the postural stability. Such a result strongly suggests that APAs act to facilitate the limb movement and to counteract perturbation forces. In conclusion, the degree of stability seems particularly tuned to the motor planning of the upper-limb during a pointing task whereas the postural chain (sitting vs. standing) was also determinant for APAs.","Callegari, Bianca; Saunier, Ghislain; Duarte, Manuela Brito; Almeida, Gizele Cristina da Silva; Amorim, Cesar Ferreira; Mourey, France; Pozzo, Thierry; Souza, Givago da Silva",PeerJ,661,19

Therefore, it is imperative to obtain an accurate depiction of the clinical utility of the eleventh revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) Personality Disorder (PD) model. The current mixed-methods systematic review aimed to determine the clinical utility of the ICD-11 PD classification system. METHOD An electronic screening of six databases was conducted and resulting studies were subjected to specific exclusion criteria, which elicited eight studies of interest. Study characteristics were tabulated and methodological quality was appraised. RESULTS Four studies offered strong support for the model's clinical utility, three offered some support accompanied by notable limitations and one study could only offer criticisms. CONCLUSION Future investigation of the ICD-11 PD classification system's (a) communicative value between clinicians and their patients, and between clinicians and their patient's families; (b) ease of use; and (c) feasibility in terms of practical application is required to achieve a complete understanding of its clinical utility and ultimately bring clarity to the current ambiguous findings.","Tracy, Mikaela; Tiliopoulos, Nikolaos; Sharpe, Louise; Bach, Bo",The Australian and New Zealand journal of psychiatry,661,29

The Pipeline Embolization Device (PED) has demonstrated safety and efficacy in the treatment of cerebral aneurysms by flow diversion, but little data exist reporting the outcomes of cranial neuropathies following treatment with the device. METHODS The prospectively maintained Barrow Neurological Institute's endovascular database was reviewed for all patients treated with the PED after presenting with one or more CN palsies secondary to a cerebral aneurysm since May 2011. Patient charts and digital subtraction angiograms were reviewed to report clinical and angiographic outcomes. Only patients with clinical follow-up were included in the analysis. RESULTS A total of 127 patients were treated with the PED at the authors' institution after FDA approval. Twentytwo patients presented with cranial neuropathies, for initial inclusion in this study. Of these, 20 had sufficient followup for analysis. Cranial neuropathies included those of CN II, III, V, and VI, with presenting symptoms of diplopia, decreased visual acuity, and facial numbness and/or pain. Thirteen lesions were cavernous segment ICA aneurysms, whereas the remainder included supraclinoid and petrous segment ICA, posterior communicating artery, and basilar trunk aneurysms. At an average clinical follow-up of 9.55 months, 15 patients (75%) had resolution or significant improvement of their cranial neuropathies, and the remaining 5 had stable symptoms. Of the 18 patients with angiographic follow-up, 12 (66.7%) demonstrated complete obliteration or small neck residual, whereas 6 (33.3%) had residual lesion. Patients with complete or near-complete obliteration of their lesion were significantly more likely to demonstrate symptomatic improvement at follow-up (p = 0.009). Two patients with persistent symptoms were eventually treated with microsurgical bypass. Transient complications in this series included 6 (30%) extracranial hemorrhagic complications related to dual-antiplatelet therapy, all of which were managed medically. There was 1 delayed right ICA occlusion following retreatment that led to microsurgical bypass. CONCLUSIONS Intracranial aneurysms presenting with one or more CN palsies show a high rate of clinical improvement after treatment with the PED. Clinical outcomes must be weighed against the risks and challenges faced with flow diverters. Further research is warranted for patients whose symptoms do not respond optimally to device placement.","Moon, Karam; Albuquerque, Felipe C; Ducruet, Andrew F; Crowley, R Webster; McDougall, Cameron G",Journal of neurosurgery,661,1

Endotracheal tube inner diameter and length significantly affect airflow resistance and thus work of breathing. While endotracheal tube shortening reduces endotracheal tube resistance, the impact on work of breathing in mechanically ventilated neonates and infants remains unknown. AIM The objective of this in vitro study was to quantify the effect of endotracheal tube shortening on work of breathing in simulated pediatric lung settings. We hypothesized that endotracheal tube shortening significantly reduces work of breathing. METHODS We used the Active-Servo-Lung 5000 to simulate different clinical scenarios in mechanically ventilated infants and neonates under spontaneous breathing with and without pressure support. Endotracheal tube size, lung resistance, and compliance, as well as respiratory settings such as respiratory rate and tidal volume were weight and age adapted for each lung model. Work of breathing was measured before and after maximal endotracheal tube shortening and the reduction of the daily energy demand calculated. RESULTS Tube shortening with and without pressure support decreased work of breathing to a maximum of 10.1% and 8.1%, respectively. As a result, the calculated reduction of total daily energy demand by endotracheal tube shortening was between 0.002% and 0.02%. CONCLUSION In this in vitro lung model, endotracheal tube shortening had minimal effects on work of breathing. Moreover, the calculated percentage reduction of the total daily energy demand after endotracheal tube shortening was minimal.","Mohr, Rebecca; Thomas, Jörg; Cannizzaro, Vincenzo; Weiss, Markus; Schmidt, Alexander R",Paediatric anaesthesia,661,24

Traditionally, central venous catheters are inserted with patient in the supine or Trendelenburg position. However, when a patient cannot tolerate supine position and the need for central venous access is urgent, catheter placement may be considered with the patient in the prone position. CASE SUMMARY A 69-year-old male with rapidly declining respiratory status secondary to COVID pneumonia quickly developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, was rapidly intubated, and then placed in the prone position. Patient could not tolerate the supine position even briefly and required a central venous catheter insertion for continuous renal replacement therapy. We kept the patient in the prone position and successfully inserted a central venous catheter in such position with real-time ultrasound guidance and using micropuncture technique. CONCLUSION In the setting of the COVID pandemic, many cases of acute respiratory distress syndrome require patients to be prone in order to improve gas exchange. In the most severe situations, these patients would not be able to tolerate rotating back to the supine position but would still require central venous catheter insertion urgently. We demonstrated feasibility of central venous catheter insertion in the prone position in these severely ill patients.","Yang, Michael X; Ng, Philip K",Journal of intensive care medicine,661,5

The oral and respiratory mucosae are the main ports of entry of FMDV, so the stimulation of local immunity in these tissues may help prevent initial infection and viral spread. E. coli heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) has been described as one of the few molecules that have adjuvant activity at mucosal surfaces. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of replication-defective adenovirus 5 (Ad5) vectors encoding either of two LT-based mucosal adjuvants, LTB or LTR72. These vectored adjuvants were delivered intranasally to mice concurrent with an Ad5-FMDV vaccine (Ad5-A24) to assess their ability to augment mucosal and systemic humoral immune responses to Ad5-A24 and protection against FMDV. Mice receiving Ad5-A24 plus Ad5-LTR72 had higher levels of mucosal and systemic neutralizing antibodies than those receiving Ad5-A24 alone or Ad5-A24 plus Ad5-LTB. The vaccine plus Ad5-LTR72 group also demonstrated 100% survival after intradermal challenge with a lethal dose of homologous FMDV serotype A24. These results suggest that Ad5-LTR72 could be used as an important tool to enhance mucosal and systemic immunity against FMDV and potentially other pathogens with a common route of entry.","Alejo, Diana M; Moraes, Mauro P; Liao, Xiaofen; Dias, Camila C; Tulman, Edan R; Diaz-San Segundo, Fayna; Rood, Debra; Grubman, Marvin J; Silbart, Lawrence K",Vaccine,661,30

We aimed to assess the prevalence of the disease in the country and provide a model for α-thal newborn screening in Bangladesh. We collected umbilical cord blood (UCB) samples from 413 unrelated newborns in Bangladesh. Demographic information, blood indices, osmotic fragility, serum iron (Fe), and zinc (Zn) levels were evaluated for all the subjects. All subjects underwent a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based diagnosis for α-thal status, followed by a multiplex gap-PCR-based identification of the deletion type present. Sixty-seven subjects had at least one α-thal deletion (16.22%). We observed that -α3.7 (rightward), - -SEA (Southeast Asian), -α4.2 (leftward), - -MED (Mediterranean) and - -THAI (Thailand) deletions were the most common α-globin deletions present in the country, with the -α3.7 (n = 37) and - -SEA (n = 18) being most prevalent. The osmotic fragility test (OFT) could predict the presence of α-thal deletions with over 98.0% sensitivity. Complete UCB count analysis revealed significant differences between healthy subjects and subjects with α-thal deletions. Although the iron level was almost the same (108.0 vs. 105.7 µg/dL), a reduced level of Zn (98.6 vs. 71.8 µg/dL, p < 0.01) was observed in the cord blood-derived serum of the subjects with α-thal deletions. Moreover, parental age at the time of delivery, gestational period, and birth weight was lower in the subjects with α-thal deletions. This study provides partial information on the epidemiology of α-thal in Bangladesh and describes a model for α-thal newborn screening in the country.","Anwar, Saeed; Taslem Mourosi, Jarin; Hasan, Md Kamrul; Hosen, Mohammad Jakir; Miah, Md Faruque",Hemoglobin,661,22

Although controversy exists as to whether the procedure should be used routinely or selectively in pancreatic cancer patients, patients considered for treatment protocols for locally unresectable pancreatic cancer should be staged laparoscopically before initiation of therapy. We evaluate the feasibility and safety of advanced staging laparoscopy including peritoneal lavage cytology, laparoscopic ultrasound sonography (LUS), and LUS-guided biopsy through a single incision for locally advanced pancreatic cancer. METHODS Staging laparoscopy was performed in 44 patients with pancreatic cancer for deciding on treatment strategy. Our procedures included extensive peritoneal lavage of abdominal cavity for cytology, LUS for small metastasis detection, and tissue sample excision including LUS-guided biopsy. Eleven consecutive patients were treated with a single-incision staging laparoscopy approach (SI-SL group). The clinical parameters were compared between the SI-SL group and the multi-incision staging laparoscopy group (multi-incision group). RESULTS The mean operating time was longer and bleeding volume was less in the SI-SL group, although the differences were without statistical significance. The conversion rates to laparotomy were 9% in the SI-SL group and 30% in the multi-incision group. There were no severe postoperative complications. LUS-guided biopsy revealed malignancy for 3 patients in the SI-SL group. CONCLUSIONS Advanced SI-SL is a feasible and safe alternative to the multi-incision approach for pancreatic cancer.","Maemura, Kosei; Shinchi, Hiroyuki; Mataki, Yuko; Kurahara, Hiroshi; Hayashi, Tomomi; Kuwahata, Taisaku; Sakoda, Masahiko; Ueno, Shinichi; Takao, Sonshin; Natsugoe, Shoji","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",661,1

AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: Laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) surgery has proved to be immediately applicable in the clinical field, being safe and feasible in the hands of experienced laparoscopic surgeons in well-selected patients. All extirpative and reconstructive urological procedures have been described in the literature, but LESS partial nephrectomy (PN) is one of the most complex procedures and few studies have been published on this subject. The study describes a clampless technique for LESS PN, by reducing the blood pressure and increasing the intra-abdominal pressure of the pneumoperitoneum to 20 mmHg, timed to precisely coincide with excision of the tumour. This technique was found to be safe and feasible in the treatment of low-risk T1a RCC. OBJECTIVE To describe the technique and report the surgical outcomes of clampless laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) partial nephrectomy (PN) in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with low PADUA score. PATIENTS AND METHODS Clampless LESS PN was performed in 14 patients with cT1a renal tumours. Indications to perform a clampless LESS PN were low-risk, laterally based renal tumours, located away from the renal hilum, with a PADUA score ≤7. Demographic data and peri-operative and postoperative variables were recorded and analysed. Kidney function was evaluated by measuring serum creatinine concentration and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) pre- and postoperatively and at 6-month follow-up. RESULTS The median operating time was 120 min and warm ischaemia time was zero in all cases. Only one early complication (Clavien grade 1) was recorded: one patient developed a flank haematoma which it was possible to treat by conservative therapy. Serum creatinine and modification of diet renal disease eGFR were not found to be significantly different pre- and postoperatively and at 6-month follow-up. Definitive pathological results showed 12 pT1a RCCs and two pT1a-chromophobe RCCs. All tumours were removed with negative surgical margins. All patients were satisfied with the cosmetic results. At a median (range) follow-up period of 12 (8-15) months, all patients were alive without evidence of tumour recurrence or port-site metastasis. CONCLUSION Clampless LESS PN is a safe and feasible surgical procedure in the treatment of low-risk T1a RCC, with excellent cosmetic results.","Springer, Christopher; Veneziano, Domenico; Wimpissinger, Florian; Inferrera, Antonino; Fornara, Paolo; Greco, Francesco",BJU international,661,1

However, in general these are laborious and require a multistep synthesis. We present a facile method based on the chelation of (18)F-aluminum fluoride (Al(18)F) by 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid (NOTA). The method is characterized by the labeling of NOTA-octreotide (NOTA-d-Phe-cyclo[Cys-Phe-d-Trp-Lys-Thr-Cys]-Throl (MH(+) 1305) [IMP466]) with (18)F. METHODS Octreotide was conjugated with the NOTA chelate and labeled with (18)F in a 2-step, 1-pot method. The labeling procedure was optimized with regard to the labeling buffer, peptide, and aluminum concentration. Radiochemical yield, specific activity, in vitro stability, and receptor affinity were determined. Biodistribution of (18)F-IMP466 was studied in AR42J tumor-bearing mice and compared with that of (68)Ga-labeled IMP466. In addition, small-animal PET/CT images were acquired. RESULTS IMP466 was labeled with Al(18)F in a single step with 50% yield. The labeled product was purified by high-performance liquid chromatography to remove unbound Al(18)F and unlabeled peptide. The radiolabeling, including purification, was performed in 45 min. The specific activity was 45,000 GBq/mmol, and the peptide was stable in serum for 4 h at 37 degrees C. Labeling was performed at pH 4.1 in sodium citrate, sodium acetate, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid, and 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid buffer and was optimal in sodium acetate buffer. The apparent 50% inhibitory concentration of the (19)F-labeled IMP466 determined on AR42J cells was 3.6 nM. Biodistribution studies at 2 h after injection showed a high tumor uptake of (18)F-IMP466 (28.3 +/- 5.2 percentage injected dose per gram [%ID/g]; tumor-to-blood ratio, 300 +/- 90), which could be blocked by an excess of unlabeled peptide (8.6 +/- 0.7 %ID/g), indicating that the accumulation in the tumor was receptor-mediated. Biodistribution of (68)Ga-IMP466 was similar to that of (18)F-IMP466. (18)F-IMP466 was stable in vivo, because bone uptake was only 0.4 +/- 0.2 %ID/g, whereas free Al(18)F accumulated rapidly in the bone (36.9 +/- 5.0 %ID/g at 2 h after injection). Small-animal PET/CT scans showed excellent tumor delineation and high preferential accumulation in the tumor. CONCLUSION NOTA-octreotide could be labeled rapidly and efficiently with (18)F using a 2-step, 1-pot method. The compound was stable in vivo and showed rapid accretion in somatostatin receptor subtype 2-expressing AR42J tumors in nude mice. This method can be used to label other NOTA-conjugated compounds with (18)F.","Laverman, Peter; McBride, William J; Sharkey, Robert M; Eek, Annemarie; Joosten, Lieke; Oyen, Wim J G; Goldenberg, David M; Boerman, Otto C","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",661,31

This was a cross-sectional study which recruited 725 women from the urban and suburban areas of Selangor, Malaysia. All study participants were instructed to self-collect vaginal sample using a dry flocked swab before responding to a detailed questionnaire documenting their experience and preference for self-sampling. Most of the study participants (>80%) perceived vaginal self-sampling as easy, convenient, not embarrassing, comfortable and were confident in performing the test. This suggests high acceptability towards vaginal self-sampling for HPV testing. Out of the 725 women, 83% preferred self-sampling HPV testing over healthcare personnel sampling HPV testing and Pap test. Women with higher household income and full-time employment status were more likely to prefer self-sampling. Those who had not undergone Pap test also expressed preference for self-sampling HPV testing. Convenience and women's confidence in performing a vaginal self-sampling for HPV testing were the independent key factors that influenced the preference for self-sampling method. Vaginal self-sampling for HPV testing is highly acceptable among Malaysian women.

Multivariate regression analysis was performed to compare the three surgical approaches. RESULTS We sampled a total of 21,090 patients who underwent colectomy. Of these, 7480 (35.5 %) had open colectomy (OC), 8751 (41.5 %) had a laparoscopic colectomy, 2860 (13.6 %) had a HAL colectomy, and 1999 (9.5 %) had an open procedure converted from LC or HAL. Multivariate regression analysis revealed HAL colectomy had a similar mortality (AOR 0.53, P = 0.07) and a lower morbidity (AOR 0.37, P < 0.01) compared to OC. LC had lower mortality (AOR 0.58, P = 0.02) and morbidity (AOR 0.43, P < 0.01) compared to OC. Mortality of patients who underwent HAL was not significantly different from LC (AOR 0.90, P = 0.79); however, morbidity of such patients was significantly higher than for patients who underwent LC (AOR 1.29, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS HAL colectomy is a safe approach with significant advantages compared to open colectomy. Although the morbidity of patients who underwent HAL is higher than patients who underwent LC, the morbidity rate is still lower than OC.","Moghadamyeghaneh, Zhobin; Carmichael, Joseph C; Mills, Steven; Pigazzi, Alessio; Nguyen, Ninh T; Stamos, Michael J",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,661,16

We designed a randomized controlled trial comparing EA with IA after minimally invasive colorectal surgery. STUDY DESIGN A total of 87 patients who underwent minimally invasive colorectal procedures at a single institution between 2011 and 2014 were enrolled. Eight patients were excluded and 38 were randomized to EA and 41 to IA. Pain was assessed with the Visual Analogue Scale and quality of life with the Overall Benefit of Analgesia Score daily until discharge. RESULTS Mean age was 57 ± 14 years, 43% of patients were female, and mean BMI was 28.6 ± 6 kg/m2. The 2 groups were similar in demographic characteristics and distribution of diagnoses and procedures. Epidural analgesia had a higher incidence of hypotensive systolic blood pressure (<90 mmHg) episodes (9 vs 2; p < 0.05) and a trend toward longer Foley catheter duration (3 ± 2 days vs 2 ± 4 days; p > 0.05). Epidural and IA had equivalent mean lengths of stay (4 ± 3 days vs 4 ± 3 days), daily Visual Analogue Scale scores (2.4 ± 2.0 vs 3.0 ± 2.0), and Overall Benefit of Analgesia Scores (3.2 ± 2.0 vs 3.2 ± 2.0), and similar time to start oral diet (2.8 ± 2 days vs 2.2 ± 1 days). Epidural analgesia patients used a higher total dose of narcotics (147.5 ± 192.0 mg vs 98.1 ± 112.0 mg; p > 0.05). Epidural and IV analgesia had equivalent total hospital charges ($144,991 ± $67,636 vs $141,339 ± $75,579; p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS This study indicates that EA has no added clinical benefit in patients undergoing minimally invasive colorectal surgery. A trend toward higher total narcotics use and complications with EA was demonstrated.","Hanna, Mark H; Jafari, Mehraneh D; Jafari, Fariba; Phelan, Michael J; Rinehart, Joseph; Sun, Coral; Carmichael, Joseph C; Mills, Steven D; Stamos, Michael J; Pigazzi, Alessio",Journal of the American College of Surgeons,661,5

Liver heterogeneity and sampling variability can affect the reliability of results. This study aimed to compare histological variability of intraoperative wedge and core liver biopsies from different lobes in bariatric patients, to better inform surgeons on biopsy method and guide interpretation of results. METHODS We prospectively recruited bariatric surgical patients. Intraoperative core biopsies were taken from the left and right lobe, with a wedge biopsy taken from the left. All biopsies were graded by a specialist liver pathologist, blinded to clinical details and biopsy site. Concordance of histological findings between sites was evaluated. RESULTS There were 91 participants (72.2% female), mean age 46.8 ± 12.0 years, body mass index 45.9 ± 9.4 kg/m2. There was no significant pattern for up- or down-grading disease dependent on biopsy technique. Moderate to strong agreement was seen in the presence of NAFLD and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH, κ = 0.609-0.865, p < 0.001) between biopsy sites. Individual components (steatosis, inflammation, ballooning) showed weaker agreement (κ = 0.386-0.656, p < 0.01). Fibrosis showed particularly poor agreement (κ = 0.223-0.496, p < 0.01). Detection of pathology improved with a combination of biopsy techniques, compared to a single biopsy method. CONCLUSION Overall diagnosis of NAFLD or NASH shows good agreement between biopsy sites, but individual components, particularly fibrosis stage, vary significantly. Clinicians should consider biopsies from varied sites, to better assess liver disease severity. These data have important implications in fibrosis assessment of NAFLD and are relevant in the interpretation of histological efficacy of investigational pharmacotherapies.

Poor discharge practices and discontinuity of care can put children and youth at heightened risk for readmission, among other adverse outcomes. However, there is limited understanding of the structure and effectiveness of interventions to facilitate discharges from CAMHS. As such, a scoping review was conducted to identify the literature on discharge interventions. This scoping review aimed to describe key components, designs, and outcomes of existing discharge interventions from CAMHS. Nineteen documents were included in the final review. Discharge interventions were extracted and summarized for pre-discharge, post-discharge, and bridging elements. Results of this scoping review found that intervention elements included aspects of risk assessment, individualized care, discharge preparation, community linkage, psychoeducation, and follow-up support. Reported outcomes of discharge interventions were also extracted and included positive patient and caregiver satisfaction, improved patient health outcomes, and increased cost effectiveness. Literature on discharge interventions from inpatient CAMHS, while variable in structure, consistently underscore the role of such interventions in minimizing patient and family vulnerability post-discharge. However, findings are limited by inadequate reporting and heterogeneity across studies. There is a need for further research into the design, implementation, and evaluation of interventions to support successful discharges from inpatient child and adolescent mental health care.","Chen, A; Dinyarian, C; Inglis, F; Chiasson, C; Cleverley, Kristin",European child & adolescent psychiatry,661,12

TA-TMA is a multifactorial disease where generalized endothelial dysfunction leads to microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, intravascular platelet activation, and formation of microthrombi leading to end-organ injury. It is essential to identify patients at risk for this complication and to implement early interventions to improve TA-TMA associated transplant outcomes. AREAS COVERED : Recognition of TA-TMA and associated multi-organ injury, risk predictors, contributing factors, differential diagnosis and targeting complement pathway in TA-TMA by summarizing peer reviewed manuscripts. EXPERT OPINION : TA-TMA is an important transplant complication. Diagnostic and risk criteria are established in children and young adults and risk-based targeted therapies have been proposed using complement blockers. The immediate goal is to extend this work into adult stem cell transplant recipients by implementing universal TA-TMA screening practices. This will facilitate early TA-TMA diagnosis and targeted interventions, which will further improve survival. While complement blocking therapy is effective, about one third of patients are refractory to treatment and those patients commonly die. The next hurdle for the field is identifying reasons for failure, optimizing strategies for complement modifying therapy and searching for additional targetable pathways of endothelial injury.","Jodele, Sonata; Sabulski, Anthony",Expert review of hematology,661,7

Here, we investigate ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression levels and their distribution across cell types in lung tissue (twelve donors, 39,778 cells) and in cells derived from subsegmental bronchial branches (four donors, 17,521 cells) by single nuclei and single cell RNA sequencing, respectively. While TMPRSS2 is strongly expressed in both tissues, in the subsegmental bronchial branches ACE2 is predominantly expressed in a transient secretory cell type. Interestingly, these transiently differentiating cells show an enrichment for pathways related to RHO GTPase function and viral processes suggesting increased vulnerability for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Even for expert surgeons, esophagojejunostomy after laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy (LATG) can be technically challenging. We perform the overlap method of esophagojejunostomy after LATG for gastric cancer. However, technical questions remain. Is the overlap method safer and more useful than other anastomosis techniques, such as methods using a circular stapler? In addition, while we perform this overlap reconstruction after LATG in a deep and narrow operative field, can the overlap method be performed safely regardless of body habitus? This study aimed to evaluate these issues retrospectively and to review the literature. METHODS From October 2005 to August 2013, we performed LATG with lymph-node dissection and Roux-en-Y reconstruction using the overlap method in 77 patients with gastric cancer. This study examined pre-, intra- and postoperative data. RESULTS Mean operation time, time to perform anastomosis, and estimated blood loss were 391.4 min, 36.3 min, and 146.9 ml, respectively. There were no deaths, and morbidity rate was 13%, including one patient (1%) who developed anastomotic stenosis. Mean postoperative hospitalization was 13.4 days. Surgical outcomes did not differ significantly by body mass index. CONCLUSIONS First, the overlap method for esophagojejunostomy after LATG is safe and useful. Second, this method can be performed irrespective of the body type of the patient. In particular, in a deep and narrow operative field, the overlap method is more versatile than other anastomosis methods. We believe that the overlap method can become a standard reconstruction technique for esophagojejunostomy after LATG.","Morimoto, Mamoru; Kitagami, Hidehiko; Hayakawa, Tetsushi; Tanaka, Moritsugu; Matsuo, Yoichi; Takeyama, Hiromitsu",World journal of surgical oncology,661,1

Decision fatigue may represent an actionable target to reduce low-value urologic care. The objective of this study was to determine whether low-value PSA testing patterns by outpatient clinicians are consistent with decision fatigue. METHODS Outpatient appointments for adult men without prostate cancer were identified at a large academic health system from 2011 through 2018. The authors assessed the association of appointment time with the likelihood of PSA testing, stratified by patient age and appropriateness of testing based on clinical guidelines. Appointments included those scheduled between 8:00 am and 4:59 pm, with noon omitted. Urologists were examined separately from other clinicians. RESULTS In 1,581,826 outpatient appointments identified, the median patient age was 54 years (interquartile range, 37-66 years), 1,256,152 participants (79.4%) were White, and 133,693 (8.5%) had family history of prostate cancer. PSA testing would have been appropriate in 36.8% of appointments. Clinicians ordered testing in 3.6% of appropriate appointments and in 1.8% of low-value appointments. Appropriate testing was most likely at 8:00 am (reference group). PSA testing declined through 11:00 am (odds ratio [OR], 0.57; 95% CI, 0.50-0.64) and remained depressed through 4:00 pm (P < .001). Low-value testing was overall less likely (P < .001) and followed a similar trend, declining steadily from 8:00 am (OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.42-0.56) through 4:00 pm (P < .001; OR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.18-0.30). Testing patterns in urologists were noticeably different. CONCLUSIONS Among most clinicians, outpatient PSA testing behaviors appear to be consistent with decision fatigue. These findings establish decision fatigue as a promising, actionable target for reducing wasteful and low-value practices in routine urologic care. LAY SUMMARY Decision fatigue causes poorer choices to be made with repetitive decision making. This study used medical records to investigate whether decision fatigue influenced clinicians' likelihood of ordering a low-value screening test (prostate-specific antigen [PSA]) for prostate cancer. In more than 1.5 million outpatient appointments by adult men without prostate cancer, the chances of both appropriate and low-value PSA testing declined as the clinic day progressed, with a larger decline for appropriate testing. Testing patterns in urologists were different from those reported by other clinicians. The authors conclude that outpatient PSA testing behaviors appear to be consistent with decision fatigue among most clinicians, and interventions may reduce wasteful testing and downstream patient harms.","Hunt, Trevor C; Ambrose, Jacob P; Haaland, Benjamin; Kawamoto, Kensaku; Dechet, Christopher B; Lowrance, William T; Hanson, Heidi A; O'Neil, Brock B",Cancer,661,6

There is uncertainty about the extent to which these hyperattenuated areas correspond to hemorrhage or contrast agent that extravasated into infarcted parenchyma during angiography. We evaluated whether it is possible to distinguish contrast extravasation from blood on MR imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS We examined the influence of iodinated contrast agents on T1, T2, and T2* and magnetic susceptibility in a phantom model and an ex vivo animal model. We determined T1, T2, and T2* relaxation times and magnetic susceptibility of iopamidol and iopromide in dilutions of 1:1; 1:2; 1:4; 1:10; and 1:100 with physiologic saline solution. We then examined the appearance of intracerebral iopamidol on MR imaging in an ex vivo animal model. To this end, we injected iopamidol into the brain of a deceased swine. RESULTS Iopamidol and iopromide cause a negative susceptibility shift and T1, T2, and T2* shortening. The effects, however, become very small in dilutions of 1:10 and higher. Undiluted iopamidol, injected directly into the brain parenchyma, did not cause visually distinctive signal changes on T1-weighted spin-echo, T2-weighted turbo spin-echo, and T2*-weighted gradient recalled-echo imaging. CONCLUSIONS It is unlikely that iodinated contrast agents extravasated into infarcted brain parenchyma cause signal changes that mimic hemorrhage on T1WI, T2WI, and T2*WI. Our results imply that extravasated contrast agents can be distinguished from hemorrhage on MR imaging.","Nikoubashman, O; Jablawi, F; Dekeyzer, S; Oros-Peusquens, A M; Abbas, Z; Lindemeyer, J; Othman, A E; Shah, N J; Wiesmann, M",AJNR.

The additional stressors created by the need to stay home and socially isolate may act as triggers to intimate partner violence (IPV). In this article, we present data from a recent online cross-sectional survey with gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) in the United States to illustrate changes in IPV risks that have occurred during the U.S. COVID-19 epidemic. The Love and Sex in the Time of COVID-19 survey was conducted online from April to May 2020. GBMSM were recruited through paid banner advertisements featured on social networking platforms, recruiting a sample size of 696 GBMSM. Analysis considers changes in victimization and perpetration of IPV during the 3 months prior to the survey (March-May 2020) that represents the first 3 months of lockdown during the COVID-19 epidemic. During the period March-May 2020, 12.6% of participants reported experiencing any IPV with higher rates of emotional IPV (10.3%) than sexual (2.2%) or physical (1.8%) IPV. Of those who reported IPV victimization during lockdown, for almost half this was their first time experience: 5.3% reported the IPV they experienced happened for the first time during the past 3 months (0.8% physical, 2.13% sexual, and 3.3% emotional). Reporting of perpetration of IPV during lockdown was lower: only 6% reported perpetrating any IPV, with perpetration rates of 1.5% for physical, 0.5% for sexual, and 5.3% for emotional IPV. Of those who reported perpetration of IPV during lockdown, very small percentages reported that this was the first time they had perpetrated IPV: 0.9% for any IPV (0.2% physical, 0.2% sexual, and 0.6% emotional). The results illustrate an increased need for IPV resources for GBMSM during these times of increased stress and uncertainty, and the need to find models of resource and service delivery that can work inside of social distancing guidelines while protecting the confidentiality and safety of those who are experiencing IPV.","Stephenson, Rob; Chavanduka, Tanaka M D; Rosso, Matthew T; Sullivan, Stephen P; Pitter, Renée A; Hunter, Alexis S; Rogers, Erin",Journal of interpersonal violence,661,33

This study aimed to identify the biological function of lncRNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 7 (SNHG7) in the progression of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). PATIENTS AND METHODS LncRNA SNHG7 expressions in NPC cell lines and 50 paired NPC tissue samples were detected by Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Transwell assay, wound healing assay and proliferation assay were conducted to evaluate the in vitro function of SNHG7 in NPC cells. Xenograft model was established for determining the in vivo effect of SNHG7 on tumor formation and metastasis of NPC. The underlying mechanism of SNHG7 in mediating the progression of NPC was explored by RT-qPCR and Western blot. RESULTS SNHG7 expression was remarkably downregulated in NPC tissues compared with that in adjacent normal samples. Knockdown of SNHG7 attenuated proliferation, invasion and migration of NPC cells. Moreover, tumor size and the number of metastatic nodules were reduced in mice administrated with NPC cells transfected with sh-SNHG7. Knockdown of SNHG7 downregulated ROCK1 at mRNA and protein level. Besides, the expression of ROCK1 in tumor tissues was positively correlated to SNHG7 expression. CONCLUSIONS Knockdown of SNHG7 inhibits migration, invasion and proliferation of NPC cells through downregulating ROCK1, which may offer a new therapeutic intervention for NPC patients.","Wang, L; Xu, T; Cui, X; Han, M; Zhou, L-H; Wei, Z-X; Xu, Z-J; Jiang, Y",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,661,24

Molecular hydrogen (H2 ) is well known to have antioxidative properties. However, its unfavorable features, ie, inflammability, low solubility, and high tissue/substance permeability, have hampered its clinical application. To overcome such obstacles, we developed a novel reconditioning method for donor organs named hydrogen flush after cold storage (HyFACS), which is just an end-ischemic H2 flush directly to donor organs ex vivo, and, herein, we report its therapeutic impact against hepatic IRI. Whole liver grafts were retrieved from Wistar rats. After 24-hour CS in UW solution, livers were cold-flushed with H2 solution (1.0 ppm) via the portal vein (PV), the hepatic artery (HA), or both (PV + HA). Functional integrity and morphological damages were then evaluated by 2-hour oxygenated reperfusion at 37°C. HyFACS significantly lowered portal venous pressure, transaminase, and high mobility group box protein 1 release compared with vehicle-treated controls (P < 0.01). Hyaluronic acid clearance was significantly higher in the HyFACS-PV and -PV + HA groups when compared with the others (P < 0.01), demonstrating the efficacy of the PV route to maintain the sinusoidal endothelia. In contrast, bile production and lactate dehydrogenase leakage therein were both significantly improved in HyFACS-HA and -PV + HA (P < 0.01), representing the superiority of the arterial route to attenuate biliary damage. Electron microscopy consistently revealed that sinusoidal ultrastructures were well maintained by portal HyFACS, while microvilli in bile canaliculi were well preserved by arterial flush. As an underlying mechanism, HyFACS significantly lowered oxidative damages, thus improving the glutathione/glutathione disulfide ratio in liver tissue. In conclusion, HyFACS significantly protected liver grafts from IRI by ameliorating oxidative damage upon reperfusion in the characteristic manner with its route of administration. Given its safety, simplicity, and cost-effectiveness, end-ischemic HyFACS may be a novel pretransplant conditioning for cold-stored donor organs.","Tamaki, Ichiro; Hata, Koichiro; Okamura, Yusuke; Nigmet, Yermek; Hirao, Hirofumi; Kubota, Toyonari; Inamoto, Osamu; Kusakabe, Jiro; Goto, Toru; Tajima, Tetsuya; Yoshikawa, Junichi; Tanaka, Hirokazu; Tsuruyama, Tatsuaki; Tolba, Rene H; Uemoto, Shinji",Liver transplantation : official publication of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the International Liver Transplantation Society,661,2

We conducted a scoping review to identify studies that enrolled cancer survivors into cardiac rehabilitation programs. Recent findings We identified nine studies that included 662 cancer survivors. Five studies integrated cancer survivors and cardiac patients into the same sessions, three studies developed cancer-only rehabilitation sessions, and one study did not report details on the rehabilitation sessions. On average, more than 60% of enrolled cancer survivors completed the rehabilitation programs and many health and psychosocial outcomes improved after rehabilitation. Summary Cardiac rehabilitation appears to be acceptable and favorably impacts many health and psychosocial outcomes among cancer survivors. Future research should consider randomized controlled trial study designs, enrolling diverse survivor populations, and using a set of core physical function and psychosocial outcomes.","Cuthbertson, Carmen C; Pearce, Emily E; Valle, Carmina G; Evenson, Kelly R",Current epidemiology reports,661,1

The aim of this meta-analysis study is to explore the associations between arginine with its related catabolic products and MDD, and to discuss the possible role of arginine catabolism in the pathoetiology of MDD. METHODS This study will be conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The English language literature published in the databases of PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Web of Science will be systematically searched. Forest plots will be used to estimate the associations between arginine and its related catabolic products with MDD. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression will also be performed to investigate the source of the potential heterogeneity. Sensitivity analysis will be performed to strengthen the results and to investigate whether any single study would have a significant effect on the results of meta-analysis. Publication bias will be tested for using the funnel plot with Begg test and Egger test. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale will be applied to assess the risk of bias of observational studies. RESULTS An integrated assessment of arginine with its related catabolic products may contribute to predict the risk of MDD. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The results of associations between arginine with its related catabolic products and MDD will be reported in a peer-reviewed publication. With our findings from this meta-analysis, we hope to provide the most up-to-date evidence for the contributions of arginine and related catabolic products to predict the risk of MDD.

STUDY DESIGN Prospective observational study. METHODS Four-hundred twenty-two eyes of 422 patients in 3 age categories (60-69 years, 70-79 years, and 80-89 years) scheduled for phacoemulsification were consecutively enrolled. The eyes underwent examinations with an infrared pupillometer to obtain the parameters of the pupillary light response preoperatively and at 1 day and 1 and 3 months postoperatively. Differences in the parameters of the pupillary response were compared among 4 time intervals and the 3 age categories. RESULTS The mean maximum and minimum pupillary diameters significantly decreased at 1 day postoperatively and returned to the preoperative level by 1 month postoperatively (P<.0001). The mean percentage of pupillary constriction was significantly reduced at 1 and 3 months postoperatively compared with preoperatively and at 1 day postoperatively (P<.0001). The average pupillary constriction and dilation velocities were significantly lower at 1 and 3 months postoperatively than they were preoperatively and at 1 day postoperatively (P<.0001). The latency to constriction did not differ significantly among the time intervals. The percentage of pupillary constriction was significantly smaller, and the average constriction and dilation velocities were lower in association with higher age categories at all time intervals (P≤.0185). CONCLUSION The pupillary light response was impaired several months after cataract surgery and worsened with increasing patient age, indicating that cataract surgery may compromise the pupillary constriction and dilation functions in association with age.","Hayashi, Ken; Yoshida, Motoaki; Ishiyama, Sosuke; Hirata, Akira",Japanese journal of ophthalmology,661,1

This review aimed to examine the definition and measurement of multimorbidity in peer-reviewed studies internationally. METHODS We systematically reviewed studies on multimorbidity, via a search of nine bibliographic databases (Ovid [PsycINFO, Embase, Global Health, and MEDLINE], Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL Plus, Scopus, and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global), from inception to Jan 21, 2020. Reference lists and tracked citations of retrieved articles were hand-searched. Eligible studies were full-text articles measuring multimorbidity for any purpose in community, primary care, care home, or hospital populations receiving a non-specialist service. Abstracts, qualitative research, and case series were excluded. Two reviewers independently reviewed the retrieved studies with conflicts resolved by discussion or a third reviewer, and a single researcher extracted data from published papers. To assess our objectives of how multimorbidity has been measured and examine variation in the chronic conditions included (in terms of number and type), we used descriptive analysis (frequencies, cross-tabulation, and negative binomial regression) to summarise the characteristics of multimorbidity studies and measures (study setting, source of morbidity data, study population, primary study purpose, and multimorbidity measure type). This systematic review is registered with PROSPERO, CRD420201724090. FINDINGS 566 studies were included in our review, of which 206 (36·4%) did not report a reference definition for multimorbidity and 73 (12·9%) did not report the conditions their measure included. The number of conditions included in measures ranged from two to 285 (median 17 [IQR 11-23). 452 (79·9%) studies reported types of condition within a single multimorbidity measure; most included at least one cardiovascular condition (441 [97·6%] of 452 studies), metabolic and endocrine condition (440 [97·3%]), respiratory condition (422 [93·4%]), musculoskeletal condition (396 [87·6%]), or mental health condition (355 [78·5%]) in their measure of multimorbidity. Chronic infections (123 [27·2%]), haematological conditions (110 [24·3%]), ear, nose, and throat conditions (107 [23·7%]), skin conditions (70 [15·5%]), oral conditions (19 [4·2%]), and congenital conditions (14 [3·1%]) were uncommonly included. Only eight individual conditions were included by more than half of studies in the multimorbidity measure used (diabetes, stroke, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, coronary heart disease, chronic kidney disease, and heart failure), with individual mental health conditions under-represented. Of the 566 studies, 419 were rated to be of moderate risk of bias, 107 of high risk of bias, and 40 of low risk of bias according to the Effective Public Health Practice Project quality assessment tool. INTERPRETATION Measurement of multimorbidity is poorly reported and highly variable. Consistent reporting of measure definitions should be required by journals, and consensus studies are needed to define core and study-dependent conditions to include in measures of multimorbidity.

Human genetic variation can affect disease progression and outcome, but little is known about genetic risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The coronaviruses SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-NL63 all utilize the human protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor to enter cells. We hypothesized that the genetic variability in ACE2 may contribute to the variable clinical outcomes of COVID-19. To test this hypothesis, we first conducted an in silico investigation of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the coding region of ACE2 gene. We then applied an integrated approach of genetics, biochemistry and virology to explore the capacity of select ACE2 variants to bind coronavirus spike protein and mediate viral entry. We identified the ACE2 D355N variant that restricts the spike protein-ACE2 interaction and consequently limits infection both in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, ACE2 polymorphisms could modulate susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, which may lead to variable disease severity.","Ren, Wenlin; Zhu, Yunkai; Lan, Jun; Chen, Hedi; Wang, Yuyan; Shi, Hongyang; Feng, Fei; Chen, Da-Yuan; Close, Brianna; Zhao, Xiaomin; Wu, Jianping; Tian, Boxue; Yuan, Zhenghong; Zhou, Dongming; Saeed, Mohsan; Wang, Xinquan; Zhang, Rong; Ding, Qiang",bioRxiv,661,1

The spread of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prompted healthcare institutions to limit in-person contact, resulting in an increase in telemedicine across all specialties, including pediatric surgery. The aims of this review were to evaluate potential barriers that limited the use of telemedicine in pediatric surgery prior to the COVID-19 period and to define how best to incorporate its use into a pediatric surgical practice going forward.MethodsA scoping review was performed to identify gaps in the literature pertaining to the use of telemedicine within general pediatric surgery in the USA prior to the outbreak of COVID-19. Next, a focused evaluation of the legislative and organizational policies on telemedicine was performed. Lastly, findings were summarized and recommendations for future research developed in the context of understanding and overcoming barriers that have plagued widespread adoption in the past.ResultsDespite evidence of telemedicine being safe and well received by adult surgical patients, a total of only three studies representing original research on the use of telemedicine within pediatric surgery were identified. Legislative and organizational policies regarding telemedicine have been altered in response to COVID-19, likely resulting in an increase in the use of telemedicine among pediatric surgeons.ConclusionsTelemedicine offers a safe and effective option for patients seeking an alternative to the in-person clinic appointment. The increased utilization of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic will provide an opportunity to learn how best to leverage the technology to decrease disparities and to overcome previous barriers.","Metzger, Gregory Jatana Kris Jordan Apfeld Deans Katherine J.; Minneci, Peter C.; Halaweish, Ihab",World Journal of Pediatric Surgery,661,26

The Internet was a gateway to the world. This article uses data from Internet speed tests, consumer complaints, search engine optimization tools, and logs of Internet use from public libraries to understand the effects of the pandemic on Internet use and performance. Despite reports that the Internet handled the surge in traffic well, we find that complaints about Internet speed nearly tripled, and performance was degraded. Downstream data rates changed little, but median upstream data rates at midday dropped by about a third. When discussing Internet performance, people typically focus on downstream. This focus should shift. Internet service providers and policymakers should reduce the asymmetry by changing how infrastructure is designed, how Internet services are advertised, how regulators write transparency rules, and how government defines ""broadband"" in subsidy programs intended to reduce the digital divide. We also find significant increases in the use of many important categories of online content, including those used for work communications, education, grocery shopping, social media, news, and job searches. This shows the importance of the Internet during the crisis. Many people without Internet at home turned to public Wi-Fi hotspots during the pandemic.

Objectives: The objective is to assess COVID-19-related fears and hopes in patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs) during the first wave of the pandemic. Methods: REUMAVID is an international collaboration led by the Health & Territory Research group at the University of Seville, together with a multidisciplinary team including patient organisations and rheumatologists. This cross-sectional study consisting of an online survey gathering data from 1,800 patients with a diagnosis of 15 RMDs recruited by patient organisations in Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and, the United Kingdom. Data are collected in two phases, the first phase between April and July 2020, the second in 2021. Participants rated a series of fears (infection, medication consequences, lack of medication, impact on healthcare, job loss, civil disorder) on a Likert scale from zero (no concern at all) to five (extremely concerned) and their hopes (treatment/vaccine availability, going outside, travel, economic situation, treatment continuation, health status) on a Likert scale from zero (not hopeful at all) to five (extremely hopeful). The Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to analyse the different fears and hopes according to socio-demographics characteristics, disease and health status. Results: 1,800 patients participated in the first phase of REUMAVID. The most frequent RMDs group was inflammatory arthritis (75.4%), the mean age was 52.6 years and 80.1% were female. The most important fear for patients was the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare (3.1 out of 5), particularly for those younger in age (3.0 vs 3.2, p=0.004), female gender (3.2 vs 2. 9 of men, p=0.003), experiencing greater pain (3.1 vs 2.8, p=0.007), with higher risk of anxiety (3.3 vs 2.9 of without anxiety, p<0.001) and depression (3.3 vs 2.9 without depression, p<0.001). The possible impact of anti-rheumatic medication and the development of severe disease if they became infected with COVID-19,was mostly feared (2.8 out of 5), by those receiving biological therapy (3.1 vs 2.5 not biological therapy, p<0.001) or those with underlying anxiety (2.9 vs 2.6 without anxiety, p=0.007). The risk of contracting COVID-19 due to their condition (2.8 out of 5), was especially feared by those with vasculitis (3.2 out of 5), who were female (2.9 vs 2.5, p<0.001), using biologics (2. 9 vs 2.7 of no use, p=0.003), in greater pain (2.8 vs 2.4, p<0.001), with a risk of anxiety (3.0 vs 2.6 without anxiety, p=0.004), and risk of depression (3.0 vs 2.6 without depression, p<0.001). The major hopes were to be able to continue with their treatment as usual (3.7 out of 5), particularly for those taking biologics (3.8 vs 3.6 not taking, p=0.026), those with a better well-being (3.8 vs 3.6 with worse well-being, p=0.021), without anxiety (3.8 vs 3.6 at risk, p=0.004) and without depression (3.8 vs 3.6 at risk, p=0.007). Hoping not to become infected with COVID-19 and to maintain the same health status, were especially those who were older (3.6 vs 3.4 p=0.018) without anxiety (3.4 vs 3.6 at risk, p=0.005), and without depression (3.6 vs 3.4 at risk, p=0.006). Another important hope was the availability of a treatment or vaccine for COVID-19, which was important for patients experiencing better well-being (3.3 vs 3.0 with worse well-being, p<0.001;Figure 1). Conclusion: The outstanding COVID-19-related fear expressed by European patients with RMDs was its impact on healthcare, while the greatest hope was to be able to continue treatment. Younger patients reported more fears while older patients were more hopeful. Those receiving biologics had greater fears and hopes associated with their treatment. In addition, patients at risk of mental disorders presented greater fears and less hopes.","Garrido-Cumbrera, M.; Marzo-Ortega, H.; Christen, L.; Carmona, L.; Correa-Fernández, J.; Sanz-Gómez, S.; Plazuelo-Ramos, P.; Webb, D.; Jacklin, C.; Irwin, S.; Grange, L.; Makri, S.; Mateus, E.; Mingolla, S.; Antonopoulou, K.; Navarro-Compán, V.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,661,24

ICE utilizes its immunization rules and patient data to evaluate and return the validity of each immunization in the patient's history along with one or more evaluation reasons. It also returns a recommendation for each vaccine group along with one or more recommendation reasons. Methods: In January 2020, ICE was first released as a Docker image along with the traditional zip archive file which had been used up to that point. Docker enables software providers to easily distribute their software so that it can be run ""out of the box"" in the user's local environment. Software running in Docker containers drastically reduces the complexity of software distribution and set up. Results: Clinical systems of many types use ICE. The project began within the public health arena as a feature of Immunization Information Systems (IIS), but electronic health records (EHR) and personal health records (PHR) have also deployed ICE. While it is not possible to identify the specific impact of ICE on clinical care without additional research, it should be pointed out that once deployed within an IIS, EHR, or PHR the display of ICE results is performed for every patient viewed by a user and often for every patient appearing on a report. In a typical month, thousands if not millions of evaluations and forecasts are performed by ICE and displayed to the users. Conclusions: The ICE Project believes in minimizing the barriers to installing and using ICE anywhere. To that end, there is no registration required to download the source code or runtime code for the ICE service and its default rule. Similarly, the Project created a Docker image of ICE to facilitate easy and seamless implementation.","Arzt, N. H.; Chertcoff, D.; Nicolary, S.; Suralik, M.; Berry, M.",Learning Health Systems,661,1

Immunized horses generated high-titre of anti-RBD antibodies with antiviral neutralizing activity on Vero-E6 cells of 1/1,000. To minimize potential adverse effects, the immunoglobulins were digested with pepsin, and purified to obtain the F(ab')2 fragments with the protocol standardized by Biotecfar C.A (R) for the production of snake antivenom. Pre-immune serum displayed an unexpected anti-RBD reactivity by ELISA (titre up to 1/900) and Western Blot, but no neutralizing activity. Modelling of the RBD of equine coronavirus showed that some of the known epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 RBD were structurally conserved in the equine coronavirus protein. This might suggest that some of the reactivity observed in the pre-immune serum to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD might be due to a previous exposure to equine coronavirus.","Cepeda, M. V.; Jimenez, J.

Firstly, the system utilizes a modern, machine learning based object detection model for detecting heads, supplanting the traditional methods that relied upon shape matching. Secondly, IRFIS is capable of running from the Android mobile platform using a small, commercial-grade infrared camera. IRFIS's head detection model when evaluated on a dataset of unseen images, achieved an AP of 96.7% with an IoU of 0.50 and an AR of 75.7% averaged over IoU values between 0.50 and 0.95.

Higher transmissibility and immunologic resistance of VOCs bring unprecedented challenges to epidemic extinguishment. Here we describe a monoclonal antibody, 2G1, that neutralizes all current VOCs and has surprising tolerance to mutations adjacent to or within its interaction epitope. Cryo-electron microscopy structure showed that 2G1 bound to the tip of receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein with small contact interface but strong hydrophobic effect, which resulted in nanomolar to sub-nanomolar affinities to spike proteins. The epitope of 2G1 on RBD partially overlaps with ACE2 interface, which gives 2G1 ability to block interaction between RBD and ACE2. The narrow binding epitope but high affinity bestow outstanding therapeutic efficacy upon 2G1 that neutralized VOCs with sub-nanomolar IC50 in vitro. In SARS-CoV-2 and Beta- and Delta-variant-challenged transgenic mice and rhesus macaque models, 2G1 protected animals from clinical illness and eliminated viral burden, without serious impact to animal safety. Mutagenesis experiments suggest that 2G1 could be potentially capable of dealing with emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants in future.

Methods: Besides the FCV-19S and SDA, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale HADS (Zigmond and Snaith), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) (Cohen et al.), the General Health Questionnaire GHQ-28 (Goldberg), and the Positive Orientation Scale P (Caprara et al.) were used in the study on 756 people aged 18-68 (M = 31.91, SD = 11.30) - 158 men and 598 women. Results: Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the one-dimensional structure of the Polish adaptation of FCV-19S, with satisfactory internal consistency and Cronbach's alpha equal to 0.84. With regard to the Polish adaptation of the SDA, instead of the 4-factorial structure (as in the original tool), the analysis uncovered a three-factor structure: intrusions/thoughts, anxiety/emotions, and avoidance. Cronbach's alpha coefficient for the entire scale was 0.92. Both tools were significantly, positively correlated with anxiety, depression, and stress levels. Conclusions: Polish adaptations of both tools are characterized by satisfactory psychometric properties, which enable their use in research and clinical practice.","Chodkiewicz, J.; Gola, M.",Postepy Psychiatrii I Neurologii,661,1

The study involved 30 anesthetists with varying age and experience, 5 hospitals of Tuscany Region and 3 different model of pulmonary ventilators. To quantify the usability levels of medical devices the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ) was used. The PSSQU was submitted to the operators using the Google Forms platform. This tool allowed us to asses user satisfaction for 4 different dimensions of usability: Overall PSSQU (user satisfaction), system usefulness (SYUSE), information quality (INFOQUAL) and interface quality (INTERQUAL). Overall, the PSSQU subscale scores show a high overall usability. The results indicate a positive reliability of the pulmonary ventilators studied, although for 2 out of 30 subjects surveyed, the PSSQU subscale score is less than 50%. The PSSQU proved to be a replicable tool for the different ventilator models in use in hospitals, and effective for measuring the usability of pulmonary ventilators, including performance, usability problems and user satisfaction. The results, although on average high, highlight the need for doctors to have: clearer and more detailed error messages, more usable and less chaotic graphic user interface (GUI), lighter and more intuitive mechanical ventilators during assembly and disassembly of components. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Pistolesi, M.; Bellucci, S.","21st Congress of the International Ergonomics Association, IEA 2021",661,7

The sudden rise in death toll and devastation associated with it has put the entire infrastructure, economy and health sector to test. The only way for the prevention and control of this infectious disease is rapid and accurate screening of masses. Public Health Authorities mainly use antibody testing in hot spots using a mix of RT-PCR and antibody testing nasopharyngeal and orpharyngeal swabs. Considering the potential risk factors, constraints of time, cost and manpower, mass screening for COVID is not possible through nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs alone. Hence, to search an alternate method to diagnose for the initial screening of patients is the need of the hour globally. Saliva can also be used as one of the diagnostic modalities for coronavirus, helping in the rapid testing of individuals at home or at hospital. The article intends to explain the evidence regarding the reliability of saliva as a diagnostic specimen in COVID-19 patients and demonstrates the association and potential of detecting novel coronavirus in saliva of patients and how its implication in future can aid in diagnosis as a non - invasive diagnostic modality.","Khemka, A.; Arora, M.; Dave, A.; Saluja, P.; Rai, R.",Journal of Evolution of Medical and Dental Sciences-Jemds,661,24

On four diverse text classification tasks, we find that common data augmentation techniques can improve the performance of triplet networks by up to 3.0% on average. To further boost performance, we present a simple training strategy called curriculum data augmentation, which leverages curriculum learning by first training on only original examples and then introducing augmented data as training progresses. We explore a two-stage and a gradual schedule, and find that, compared with standard single-stage training, curriculum data augmentation trains faster, improves performance, and remains robust to high amounts of noising from augmentation.","Wei, Jason; Huang, Chengyu; Vosoughi, Soroush; Cheng, Yu; Xu, Shiqi",,661,16

Mental accounting generally shows people's attitudes to profit and loss. Richard Thaller created four rules of his theory. The article focuses on one of the rules of this theory, the rule of distribution incomes, which says that people are more satisfied with several smaller incomes than with one larger, which is the sum of the smaller ones. Research purpose: The research goal was to check if the rule of distributing incomes is used to a group of people randomly selected. Methods: The research was made using a survey method, which was available online on 9-20.04.2020. 156 respondents took part in the survey. The respondents were chosen randomly. The survey consisted of seven questions. Three of them referred to the respondents, the others described various life situations, which was described the distribution of incomes. The respondents were grouped according to gender, age and education. Then, in each of the four described situations, they answered exactly the same question, if they prefer several smaller incomes or one larger being the sum of the smaller ones. Conclusions: The results of the research showed that randomly selected renspodents prefer one larger income being the sum of smaller incomes than several smaller incomes of exactly the same value. The same results were confirmed by respondents regardless of gender, age or education. The results may have been affected by the situation during the tests were performed. This time was the beginning of quarantine during a worldwide coronavirus pandemic.

There has been little research in this area in the Caribbean. This exploratory study aimed to evaluate public trust in information sources, confidence in institutions and COVID-19 vaccine willingness in Trinidad and Tobago. Methods An exploratory online survey was conducted in Trinidad and Tobago from November 10th to December 7th 2020. The survey instrument was a validated questionnaire developed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and adapted to the local setting. Descriptive statistics and regression analyses were used to analyse the data. Findings The most trusted sources of information included health workers (32.5%) and the ministry of health (23.6 %). Increasing levels of trust in the medical sector were associated with decreasing levels of believing misinformation. Overall, 62.8 % of participants said they would take the COVID-19 vaccine if available. Regression analyses showed those who agreed that everyone should adhere to the national immunization schedule and those who would take the flu vaccine, were 2.77 (95% CI 1.77-4.35) and 4.60 (95% CI 3.11-6.84) timesmore likely to take the vaccine, respectively. Interpretation Our study found increasing trust in health sources, confidence in medical sector, adherence to the national immunisation schedule and acceptance of the flu vaccine may increase COVID-19 vaccine willingness rates. Although the generalisability of the findings is limited, the results of this exploratory survey may be used to identify areas for prioritisation and improvement in future research.","De Freitas, Loren Basdeo Damion Wang Han- I.",The Lancet Regional Health - Americas,661,5

For example, the information if a room is unoccupied can be used for automatically switching off the light, air conditioning, and ventilation, thereby saving significant amounts of energy in public buildings. Most existing solutions rely on dedicated hardware installations, which involve presence sensors, video cameras, and carbon dioxide sensors. Unfortunately, such approaches are costly, are subject to privacy concerns, have high computational requirements, and lack ubiquitousness. The work presented in this article addresses these limitations by proposing a low-cost occupancy detection system. Our approach builds upon detecting variations in Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signals related to the presence of humans. The effectiveness of this approach is evaluated by performing comprehensive tests on five different datasets. We apply several pattern recognition models and compare our methodology with systems building upon IEEE 802.11 (WiFi). On average, in multifarious environments, we can correctly classify the occupancy with an accuracy of 97.97%. When estimating the number of people in a room, on average, the estimated number of subjects differs from the actual one by 0.32 persons. We conclude that our system's performance is comparable to that of existing ones based on WiFi, while significantly reducing cost and installation effort. Hence, our approach makes occupancy detection practical for real-world deployments.","Demrozi, Florenc; Turetta, Cristian; Chiarani, Fabio; Kindt, Philipp H.; Pravadelli, Graziano",,661,1

The continuation of this toxicity beyond Brexit means that nationalist narratives have become Britain’s new ‘politics of everything’ (Valluvan 2019). The past five years have seen growing British contempt for technocracy, with ‘us and them’ populist narratives gaining widespread traction as the United Kingdom’s (UK) volatile political environment moves away from the political procedures and economic values by which the UK has operated since 1945. Since early 2020, this narrative has been significantly accelerated by Covid-19 countermeasures, with anti-EU parties and narratives on the left and right becoming anti-lockdown or anti-vaccine advocates. This commentary approaches the surge in British populism as emblematic of the UK’s shift from centrism towards polarised factions defined not by party, but by cross-spectrum contempt for technical governance. We argue that while populism is a worldwide phenomenon, it is not homogenous and the UK is particularly vulnerable to anti-status quo discourses and narratives.

This paper is based on extensive review of literature conducted to stimulate pertinent descriptive information on COVID-19 pandemic and public health system challenges in India. The COVID-19 pandemic has created unprecedented challenges on India's public health system. India has implemented several strategies to mitigate the pandemic, but the rapid spread of the virus poses huge challenges of hitherto unseen scale on multiple fronts. India's public health system is chronically underfunded, leading to a shortage of COVID-19 treatment facilities. Even the available health resources are unevenly distributed across states resulting in huge disparities in emergency preparedness and management of the pandemic. Due to lack of robust primary health care system and effective public health strategies, vulnerable population in most states are prone to the pandemic and risk of severe complications. The findings can draw attentions of health policy makers to develop appropriate policy for future pandemic preparedness and management.","Nair, K.

One of the efficient methods to evaluate response to vaccination is the assessment of humoral immunity by measuring Sars-Cov-2 antibody titer. Identification of factors that affect the humoral response is important so as to ameliorate the responses to vaccination or identify vulnerable groups that may need vaccination boosters. Objective We investigated the effect of anthropometric parameters (age, BMI), smoking, diabetes, statin use hypertension and levels of 25(OH)D and DHEAS to the Sars-Cov-2 antibody titer. Methods In this longitudinal observational cohort study 712 subjects were tested for Sars-Cov-2 antibodies 3 months after the second dose of BNT162b2 vaccine. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to identify which factors are associated with the antibody titer. Results We identified age to be negatively associated with antibody titer (p=0.0073) and male sex (p=0.0008). However, interaction of age and gender was significant (p<0.0001) highlighting the finding that only after the age of 40 years men had lower antibody levels than women. DHEAS, an aging marker, was not associated with the antibody titer. Smoking was also associated with low antibody titer (p=0.0008) while overweight or obese subjects did not have different antibody response compared to normal weight individuals. Although diabetic and hypertensive subjects trended towards lower antibody titer, this association was not statistically significant. Replete vitamin D levels were associated with higher antibody titers (p=0.00422). Conclusions Age, male sex and smoking negatively affects antibody titer while 25(OH)D is associated with increased Sars-Cov-2 antibody titers.","Parthymou, A.; Habeos, E. E.; Habeos, G.

The real-time recorded welding current, voltage, thermal cycles at the base plate, and the synchronized high-speed arc images with each deposited layer were used to understand the arc behavior. A gradual increase in the peak temperature was noticed from the first layer to the fifth layer, and the same decreased with the subsequent deposition of the layers. The intensity of the welding arc was high during the boost phase of the CMT cycle, where most of the base plate and the electrode melting happens. For a given process parameter, the welding arc intensity gradually increased from the first layer to the fifth layer while remained approximately similar from the fifth layer to the tenth layer. The effect of this arc intensity variation was reflected in the consistency of the deposited bead profile. It was observed that the bead width gradually increased from the first layer to the fourth layer and remained approximately the same from fifth to the tenth layer.","Shukla, Pranjal; Dash, Balaram; Kiran, Degala Venkata; Bukkapatnam, Satish",Procedia Manufacturing,661,1

Various SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have been developed and are being used for vaccination worldwide. However, no therapeutic agents against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been developed so far;therefore, new therapeutic agents are urgently needed. In the present study, we evaluated several hepatitis C virus direct-acting antivirals as potential candidates for drug repurposing against COVID-19. Theses include asunaprevir (a protease inhibitor), daclatasvir (an NS5A inhibitor), and sofosbuvir (an RNA polymerase inhibitor). We found that asunaprevir, but not sofosbuvir and daclatasvir, markedly inhibited SARS-CoV-2-induced cytopathic effects in Vero E6 cells. Both RNA and protein levels of SARS-CoV-2 were significantly decreased by treatment with asunaprevir. Moreover, asunaprevir profoundly decreased virion release from SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. A pseudoparticle entry assay revealed that asunaprevir blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection at the binding step of the viral life cycle. Furthermore, asunaprevir inhibited SARS-CoV-2 propagation in human lung Calu-3 cells. Collectively, we found that asunaprevir displays broad-spectrum antiviral activity and therefore might be worth developing as a new drug repurposing candidate for COVID-19.","Lim, Y. S.; Nguyen, L.

A novel mutation in nitric oxide synthase interacting protein (NOSIP) determined NO levels produced by human monocytes and was associated with disease severity in Sepsis patients. The study reveals NOSIP as an important regulator of inflammation by virtue of its ability to influence nitric oxide production both in mice and in humans and opens up novel avenues for therapeutic strategies against acute inflammation.

As of 2016, the development of a novel drug candidate required up to $ USD 2.6 billion in investment for only 10% rate of approval by the FDA. To help decreasing the costs associated with the process, a number of in silico approaches have been developed with relatively low success due to limited predicting performance. Here, we introduced a machine learning-based algorithm as an alternative for a more accurate search of new pharmacological candidates, which takes advantage of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for active molecule prediction within large databases. Our approach, termed PharmaNet was implemented here to search for ligands against specific cell receptors within 102 targets of the DUD-E database, which contains 22886 active molecules. PharmaNet comprises three main phases. First, a SMILES representation of the molecule is converted into a raw molecular image. Second, a convolutional encoder processes the data to obtain a fingerprint molecular image that is finally analyzed by a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). This approach enables precise predictions of the molecules’ target on the basis of the feature extraction, the sequence analysis and the relevant information filtered out throughout the process. Molecule Target prediction is a highly unbalanced detection problem and therefore, we propose that an adequate evaluation metric of performance is the area under the Normalized Average Precision (NAP) curve. PharmaNet largely surpasses the previous state-of-the-art method with 97.7% in the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) and 65.5% in the NAP curve. We obtained a perfect performance for human farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS), which is a potential target for antimicrobial and anticancer treatments. We decided to test PharmaNet for activity prediction against FPPS by searching in the CHEMBL data set. We obtained three (3) potential inhibitors that were further validated through both molecular docking and in silico toxicity prediction. Most importantly, one of this candidates, CHEMBL2007613, was predicted as a potential antiviral due to its involvement on the PCDH17 pathway, which has been reported to be related to viral infections.","Puentes, Paola Ruiz; Valderrama, Natalia; González, Cristina; Daza, Laura; Muñoz-Camargo, Carolina; Cruz, Juan C.; Arbeláez, Pablo",bioRxiv,661,22

The article demonstrates how COVID-19 has affected emergency cardiac surgery care. Objective To analyze the features of completed cases of emergency coronary artery bypass grafting (ECABG) and COVID-19 diagnosed during the postoperative period at the Research Institute – Ochapovsky Regional Hospital no. 1 for the period from May 1, 2020 to February 1, 2021. Material and Methods Completed cases of ECABG have been retrospectively studied. EACS was performed in 145 patients: in 79 people with unstable angina pectoris (NS), in 40 with Q-negative myocardial infarction (MI), in 14 cases with primary Q-positive MI, in 12 patients with recurrent MI. The condition for ECABG was a negative SARS-Cov-2 PCR result and the absence of viral pneumonia by CT. The patients were divided into 2 subgroups. The first one included people with ECABG that were not diagnosed with COVID-19 during postoperative follow-up in the hospital. Subgroup II had patients with ECABG and COVID-19 diagnosed during the hospitalization. Results Contingency tables showed a statistically significant interaction between group membership and mortality, 2.3% (n = 3) in subgroup 1 and 20% (n = 3) in subgroup 2, Pearson’s test χ2 = 10.6, p &lt; 0.05. When analyzing survival rate in the EACS + COVID-19 subgroup, it is worth paying attention to the cumulative proportion of survivors, considering the severity of the course of viral pneumonia. The proportion of such patients with CT-4 by the 32nd day of hospital stay was 0.3. Conclusions Mortality rate in the postoperative course after ECABG with COVID-19 is significantly higher. In patients who underwent ECABG and died in the early and late postoperative period from COVID-19, a new coronavirus infection was diagnosed at a later date. In these cases, a considerably longer duration of CPB and a higher level of ferritin were revealed at the time of transference to the observation department. Survival rate in ECABG patients due to primary Q-negative MI is significantly lower in comparison with patients hospitalized for unstable angina. © 2021 Kubankurortresurs, OOO.

Methods 201 acute-phase nasopharyngeal samples from SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals were tested with two rRT-PCRs: 1) N2RP assay to confirm SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection (CDC N2 target), and 2) the Spike SNP assay to detect mutations in the spike receptor binding domain. The assay was performed with probes to identify mutations associated with the following variants: alpha (501Y), beta/gamma (417variant/484K/501Y), delta (452R/478K), and lambda (452Q/490S). Results All samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the N2RP assay (mean Ct, 20.8; SD 5.6); 198/201 (98.5%) tested positive in the Spike SNP assay. The most common genotype was 417variant/484K/501Y, detected in 102/198 samples (51.5%) and most consistent with P.1 lineage (gamma variant) in Paraguay. No mutations (K417 only) were found in 64/198 (32.3%); and K417/484K was identified in 22/198 (11.1%), consistent with P.2 (zeta). Seven samples (3.5%) tested positive for 452R without 478K, and one sample with genotype K417/501Y was confirmed as B.1.1.7 (alpha). Results were confirmed by Sanger sequencing in 181/181 samples (100%) with high-quality amplicon sequences, and variant calls were consistent with Nanopore sequencing in 29/29 samples. Conclusions The Spike SNP assay provides accurate detection of mutations associated with SARS-CoV-2 variants. This can be implemented in laboratories performing rRT-PCR to improve population-level surveillance for these mutations and inform the judicious use of scarce sequencing resources.","Martinez, M.; Nguyen, P.-V.; Su, M.; Cardozo, F.; Valenzuela, A.; Franco, L.; Galeano, M.

It is also a “mutual mirror”, reflecting the exclusive duality and resending to “different” space and time where the therapeutic relationship acts.ResultsIn this way the “analysis room” loses its physical feature to move towards a new dimension where the subjective experience are communicated/lived/re-elaborated by the mean of shared visual, modifyng the codified space of a traditional setting.ConclusionsThe screen is not only a mere vehicle of verbal communication, but fully gets in “hic et nunc” in space relationship assuming however an allegoric value, that, in the individual subjective, could go really beyond its “simple” and usual technological function.","Cerino, S.",European Psychiatry,661,1

Growing evidence suggests that mindfulness-based interventions can reduce BP and improve psychological outcomes but the in-person format of traditional programs limits access. The goal of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and effects of telephone-delivered mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT-T) in women with prehypertension. Methods: We conducted a pilot RCT in which 37 women meeting JNC 7 criteria for prehypertension (SBP 120-139 mmHg or DBP 80-89 mmHg) and not taking antihypertensive medication were recruited from outpatient clinics or via the EHR. Eligible participants were randomized to usual care or MBCT-T, which involved 8 weekly 1-hour phone sessions delivered to small groups by a trained instructor. Outcomes included feasibility (session completion), acceptability (Client Satisfaction Questionnaire [CSQ]), SBP (mean of 3 clinic BP measurements), perceived stress (PSS-10) and depressive symptoms (PHQ-8). Linear mixed models with a random effect of intervention cohort were performed to compare 3-month changes in outcomes between study arms, adjusting for age and ethnicity. Results: The mean age was 50.7±17.7, 68% of participants were racial/ethnic minorities, and baseline SBP/DBP was 127.8±6.2/77.5±7.2 mmHg. There were no significant differences between study arms in demographics or baseline characteristics. The median number of sessions completed was 6 of 8. Fewer sessions were completed by employed vs. unemployed women (4.5 vs. 7.8,t=3.55, p=.003) and by foreign-born vs. U.S.-born women (2.8 vs. 5.9, t=1.87, p=.08). Overall 3-month retention was 89% but follow-up BP was missing in ∼50% of participants due to COVID-19research restrictions. Three-quarters of MBCT-T participants reported high satisfaction with theintervention (CSQ24). In the subgroup with complete follow-up data, SBP declined in both studyarms but there was no significant between-group difference (p=0.51). Conversely, greater reductionsin perceived stress and depressive symptoms were observed in the MBCT-T arm vs. usual care(between-group differences of 3.63 [PSS-10;p=.163] and 2.90 [PHQ-8;p=.008]). In per-protocolanalyses limited to MBCT-T participants who completed ≥4 sessions, effects were larger forperceived stress and similar for depressive symptoms (between-group differences of 6.17 [PSS-10;p=.012] and 2.77 [PHQ-8;p=.025]). Conclusions: Results support the feasibility and acceptability of telephone-based mindfulnesstraining in diverse women with prehypertension. Promising findings for stress and depressivesymptoms suggest further studies are warranted. Strategies to address barriers to participation, particularly among working women and minorities, are needed.","Kalinowski, J.; Castaneda, S. F.; Allison, M. A.; Duberstein, Z.

Data are mounting about after-effects in circulation, respiration, coagulation, problematic outcomes in rheumatology, dermatology, ophthalmology, as well as about the acute and prolonged symptoms of the dysfunctional central nervous system. Initially, sporadic case reports, later results of population based studies and animal models were available, and the first systematic review articles were emerging during preparation of our survey. Lesions of the central nervous system may manifest themselves both in neurological symptoms and diseases or psychiatric complaints and syndromes. The scale of symptoms is broad, the pathomechanisms are not perfectly mapped thus all therapeutic approaches are in their infancy yet. Epidemiological data of neuropsychiatric complications are incomplete for the time being though they have been rapidly becoming more accurate. Conservative estimates assume tens of millions of people affected worldwide. More time is necessary to assess the persistence or improvement of the prolonged symptoms. Besides every efforts to block the spread of the virus, the utmost importance is to analyze the effects of the virus on the central nervous system and to develop effective treatment strategies. According to our current knowledge, the pathomechanism of neuropsychiatric complications is multifactorial. Beyond the direct deleterious effect of the virus on neuronal and glial functions, more important is that the serious consequences of cerebrovascular dysfunction and poor oxygenation have to be taken into consideration together with extended and prolonged systemic immunological processes, which markedly harm the brain tissue, notably neurons, axons, synapses and glia cells. Based on a non-systematic literature review our work details these mechanisms and addresses therapeutic options as well. © 2021 Literatura Medica Publishing House. All rights reserved.","Frecska, E.

The present review explores PTG by psychological therapists. The review focused on the prevalence of PTG, how often consent is sought from the patient, and the motivations for and consequences of PTG.A narrative literature review of published PTG studies was undertaken. Potentially eligible studies were identified by searching PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, Psychology and Behavioural Sciences Collection, and MEDLINE. Results were screened for suitability for inclusion in the sample (n = 9). All studies were appraised for quality using a structured tool developed for this review.PTG prevalence rates ranged from 20% to 98%, with rates of non‐consent ranging from 60% to 84%. Motivations for PTG included curiosity, to gather new information and to verify existing information. Consequences of PTG included enhancing the therapist's sense of safety and causing harm to the therapeutic relationship.Current literature on PTG is limited and focussed largely in the United States. This review revealed no published PTG studies including UK‐based psychological therapists, as well as issues in defining and operationalising PTG. Further research is needed to understand the prevalence of PTG by UK‐based psychological therapists, as well as the motivations behind, and consequences of, PTG. This evidence base will inform the development of PTG professional guidelines and training, neither of which currently exist for therapists practising in the UK. Both would be timely given the increasing move of the therapeutic frame to the online environment due to the COVID‐19 pandemic.

Many centers have delayed in-person visits by expanding the use of telemedicine (TM). The New Orleans Louisiana Neuroendocrine Tumor Specialists (NOLANETS) is a specialty referral center for patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NET), a rare cancer. This study sought to analyze the experience of TM in patients with a rare cancer and compare their experience with general oncology (Gen Onc) patients. Methods: NET patients completed an online survey conducted by the Neuroendocrine Cancer Awareness Network (NCAN), or an identical mailed paper survey conducted by NOLANETS. Data from these patients were pooled. Gen Onc patients completed the identical online survey using REDCap. Multi-disciplinary oncology physicians completed a unique online survey using REDCap. Results: NET patients (n = 247) rated their overall experience of TM as excellent (47%;n = 116) or good (41%;n = 102), and Gen Onc patients (n = 508) rated their experience as excellent, (54.6%;n = 305) and good (35.2%;n = 197);with no statistical difference between the cohorts. However, NET patients were less likely to agree that all their questions were answered than Gen Onc patients (p < 0.001). Factors associated with suboptimal experience for both cohorts included: telephone format and connection issues. Patients who experienced connection issues were less likely to agree that their questions were answered (NET p = 0.004;Gen Onc p < 0.0001) or that they wanted additional virtual visits (NET p = 0.004;Gen Onc p < 0.0001). NET patients reported a significant difference in the travel required to receive inperson care than Gen Onc patients (p < 0.0001) and significant cost savings associated with TM (p = 0.012). Physicians (n = 51) reported that they were able to effectively care for their patients using TM (88%), however there were significant differences when providers were asked if they were able to provide adequate care for follow-up (FU) visits vs new patient visits vs end-of-life visits (FU vs new, p = 0.000;FU vs End of Life, p < 0.0001;New vs End of Life, p = 0.009). Conclusions: While most NET and Gen Onc patients had a positive experience with TM, connection issues, and audio-only platform significantly decreased the overall experience. Importantly, while NET patients reported a significant cost savings, they were less likely to agree that all their questions were answered when compared to Gen Onc patients. And while most physicians agreed that they were able to effectively care for their patients, additional considerations should be made when new patients or end-of-life patients participate in TM. These results suggest that TM may offer new opportunities for rare-cancer patients but also poses unique challenges.","Bren-Mattison, Y.; Maluccio, M.

This paper investigates the impact of higher NPL ratios on the availability of bank credit among international lenders and emerging market borrowers. The paper finds that a rise in NPL ratios in both lender and borrower countries is positively associated with higher banking outflows from emerging market economies. Two additional features emerge in the patterns of cross-border banking flows when NPL ratios rise that are related to international credit market imperfections. First, lenders are more responsive to a rise in NPL ratios of same-region borrowers. This is consistent with the “reversion to the mean’’ effect given their generally high exposures to the same-region borrowers. Second, while a high share of US-dollar-denominated debt is generally positively associated with withdrawals of funds from emerging market borrowers, lenders are less responsive to a rise in NPL ratios in emerging market economies if their liabilities are denominated more in US dollars. The results are in line with the “original sin redux” hypothesis. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Park, C. Y.; Shin, K.",Journal of Banking and Finance,661,1

The pandemic is still going strong, with additional viral variations popping up all the time. For the close to future, the international response will have to continue. The molecular tests for SARS-CoV-2 detection may lead to False-negative results due to their genetic similarity with other coronaviruses, as well as their ability to mutate and evolve. Furthermore, the clinical features caused by SARS-CoV-2 seem to be like the symptoms of other viral infections, making identification even harder. We constructed seven hidden Markov models for each coronavirus family (SARS-CoV2, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV), using their complete genome to accurate diagnose human infections. Besides, this study characterized and classified the SARS-CoV2 strains according to their different geographical regions. We built six SARS-CoV2 classifiers for each world's continent (Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, South America, and Australia). The dataset used was retrieved from the NCBI virus database. The classification accuracy of these models achieves 100% in differentiating any virus model among others in the Coronavirus family. However, the accuracy of the continent models showed a variable range of accuracies, sensitivity, and specificity due to heterogeneous evolutional paths among strains from 27 countries. South America model was the highest accurate model compared to the other geographical models.

Another purpose is to examine the planning and development of the faculty building to understand its strategy, which serves as a means to contribute to the planning and development theory. Design/methodology/approach: A case study of the Faculty of Architecture building was conducted at Thammasat University in Thailand. The DAS framework was used to reconstruct and examine the development process of the building to determine the gaps between supply and demand in terms of building space, to reflect on the building plan and process and to make suggestions as to how the DAS framework might be improved. Research methods included interviews and document analysis concerning space requirements and provision in the Faculty of Architecture building. Findings: The gaps between supply and demand in terms of the faculty building space are affected by the condition of the building (i.e. building obsolescence), the number of building users and the changing environmental context. This study shows that both pre-design and post-occupancy evaluation are essential to collect data concerning the match or mismatch between supply and demand of space and to assess users’ needs and preferences concerning the faculty building. Regarding the building development process, factors impacting the step-by-step planning of the real estate interventions include the organisational context (public/private sector) and the management of the construction project (time, cost, quality). The DAS framework is found to be useful for structuring the information-generating processes necessary to determine gaps between demand and supply in terms of space and for making decisions regarding real estate interventions. Research limitations/implications: Additional case studies in different environmental and organisational contexts are required to test the DAS framework and improve data validity. This study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic period, which affected data accessibility. Practical implications: The results provide insight into the influence of various factors on the decision of corporate real estate. The DAS framework can be used to explore the range of demand for and supply of space and to find an optimal match. Originality/value: This paper shows valuable steps in planning and development of educational real estate and a first application of the DAS framework in Thailand. The findings confirm the importance of the physical learning environment of architecture schools, particularly the studio spaces required in architecture education. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Riratanaphong, C.",Facilities,661,1

The online connectivity of devices through social media is one example of Internet of Things (IoT) in which a two-way communication between societies and officials, could be created. Therefore, it is possible to monitor people's behavior through OSNs, especially during pandemics, to prevent potential social and psychological instabilities that might lead to undesired consequences. This is particularly crucial for governmental and non-governmental organizations to ensure the stability and well-being in societies. In response, we propose a pandemic-friendly real-time framework for monitoring cyber social behavior by utilizing unsupervised and supervised learning approaches. Two BERT-based supervised classifiers are trained and constructed to analyze two types of online social behaviors, hate and sentiment. Unsupervised framework is proposed for OSNs data exploration and coherent interpretation that is used as a complementary tool to facilitate the analysis of online social behaviors during pandemics. Extensive experimentation and evaluation have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed work. Our results have shown superior performance of our BERT-based models in two classification tasks: 1) binary classification for hate behavior detection and 2) multi-class classification for sentiment behavior detection. In addition to our experimentation results, our large-scale analysis of COVID-19 pandemic has illustrated the capability of our unsupervised framework for concerns and trends discoveries using OSNs data, along with reliability in automatically and dynamically providing phrase-based interpenetration of the inferred trends and concerns.

It caused much potential risk exposure for commodity futures trading and impacted pricing and valuation models in many derivatives. One of the essential hidden risks of commodity futures exposed by this event is high storage and delivery cost of their physical settlement, which reduces the hedging functionality of commodity futures during high volatile market periods, such as the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. This chapter proposes options to hedge the risk by the fluctuation of physical settlement cost. Since both listed and over-the-counter (OTC) options may take a long time to be issued in the market, we propose to use blockchain technology to issue physical settlement rights by tokens. The transportation and storage provider can make profits by this covered-call like options strategies. At the same time, commodity futures traders can get proper insurance for this kind of recent unexpected risk for sky-rocketing high physical delivery cost. Blockchain technologies such as smart contract and decentralized settlement system can be more flexible to offer these options rather than traditional derivatives exchanges. And the premium can be paid by the commodity itself to the transportation and storage provider to link token value closely to physical goods and reduce inflation caused by currency over-issue.

Cancer patients also get COVID infection and in some patients this infection is mortal. In our study, we examined the course of COVID-19 infection in patients who actively or in the past used Everolimus. Methods: Patients who used everolimus actively or in the past were examined in our study. Patients who survive after the first cases seen in Turkey March 11, 2020 ;were evaluated in terms of whether they had COVID-19. Demographic characteristics and primary malignancies of the patients were examined. Patients who had COVID-19 infection and died were identified. Results: Our study consists of 50 patients in total. 14 (28%) of the patients were male and 36 (72%) were female. The average age of the patients is 56.72 (28-82), the average age of the male patients is 52.8 (28- 80) and the average age of the female patients is 57.58 (36-82). 17 of the patients were treated for breast cancer, 11 for neuroendocrine tumor, 7 for tuberous sclerosis, 5 for renal cell carcinoma, 4 for thymic carcinoma, 2 for thymoma, 2 for ovarian ca, 2 for perivascular ecrine tumor. While it is the most common breast cancer in women (47.2% of female patients), neuroendocrine tumor is the most common in male patients (35.7% of male patients). While 13 patients were actively using everolimus (26%), 37 patients (74%) had discontinued everolimus treatment for 1 year or more.5 of our patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection (10% of all patients). 2 of these five patients are actively using everolimus. Of those diagnosed with COVID-19, 3 are women and 2 are men.The average age of the patients is 50.08 (43-66). While 3 patients had mild illness (60%), 2 patients (40%) died. One of the deceased patients is female and one is male. The female patient had a history of using everolimus for breast cancer, while the male patient died at the age of 52 while actively using everolimus for thymoma. Conclusions: Everolimus is a MTOR inhibitor used in many malignancy treatments. In our study, we found that 10% of our patients had COVID infection and 2 of our patients died due to COVID-19. In the group that discontinued everolimus treatment for a year or more, 1 patient died due to COVID-19, and 1 patient in the group still receiving everolimus treatment. Studies with larger patient populations are needed to determine whether everolimus carries an additional risk of COVID-19 infection.","Pehlivan, M.; Aydiner, A.",Journal of Clinical Oncology,661,1

As of 5/22/20 there are 5.08 million confirmed cases and 332,000 deaths worldwide. Primary manifestations are respiratory, with a subset developing severe hypoxic respiratory failure. Several risk factors predispose patients to worse outcomes including age, obesity, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, COPD, asthma, CHF, and diabetes. This is a retrospective cohort analysis of patients with Rheumatoid arthritis, Ankylosing spondylitis, or Psoriatic arthritis who were hospitalized for COVID-19 infection across 165 HCA hospitals from 1/1/2020 to 5/30/2020. We compared endpoints and calculated odds of ICU admission, invasive ventilation, mortality compared to control as well as length of stay and discharge location. Objectives: Our objectives include measuring the outcome of Patients in two arms, the first being those with Rheumatoid arthritis, Ankylosing spondylitis, and Psoriatic arthritis who are infected with COVID 19 to an age matched and comorbidity matched arm (using the Charlson comorbidity index) for the composite endpoint of ICU admission, invasive ventilation, and death. We believe the inflammatory arthropathy arm will have a worse composite endpoint then the control arm. we will also attempt to calculate a hazard ratio of this arm vs the control to the composite endpoint. We will also examine the length of stay as well as inflammatory markers mentioned in between the two arms. We suspect initial inflammatory markers will be lower in the inflammatory arthropathy arm, particularly CRP and LDH, due to chronic immune modulating medication and these markers will not correlate as closely with severe illness represented by the composite endpoint as in the control arm. Methods: We analyzed 86,217 patients admitted with COVID-19 comparing 751 patients who had inflammatory arthropathy to patients who did not. T tests were used for parametric outcome and chi square tests for non-parametric outcomes. Multivariate analysis included potential confounders such as age, and comorbidities such as diabetes, heart disease, etc. Results: The odds ratio for mortality in the arthropathy arm was 1.37 with a confidence interval of 1.09 to 1.71 with a p value of 0.006. The odds ratio for ventilation was 1.35 with CI of 1.09 to 1.67 and p value of 0.006. The odds ratio of ICU admission was 1.46 with CI of 1.24 to 1.72 and P value of 0.000. The average length of stay of the arthropathy arm was 8.51 days +/-10.02 vs 4.59 days +/-8.26 of the control, p < 0.001. The discharge disposition of the arthropathy arm vs control group is as follows, 13.32% died inpatient vs 5.87% in the control, 56.72% were discharged home vs 77.19%, 6.79% went to hospice care vs 3.10%, 4.79% remained inpatient at the end of the study interval vs 3.45%, 17.18% were discharged to rehab vs 8.43%, and other discharges not included in the above groupings were 1.2% vs 1.96%, p<0.001. 31.29% of the arthropathy group required ICU admission vs 16.32% and 13.98% required ventilation vs 6.9%, p <0.001. The average age was higher in the arthropathy arm vs control at 66.56 years old vs 51.53, p <0.001. Charlson comorbidity index was also higher in the arthropathy arm at 2.72 vs 0.96, p <0.001. Conclusion: This is a large analysis of inflammatory arthropathy patients hospitalized with COVID-19. While the arthropathy group was older, and had more co-morbidities, when adjusting for potential confounders, inflammatory arthropathy patients had a higher risk of death and mechanical ventilation, as well as longer length of stay.","Collins, T.; Patel, V.; Babajanians, A.; Kubomoto, S.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,661,16

Online fresh food shopping provides consumers with an alternative to shopping in a traditional market, while also enabling procurement of such goods at a reduced risk of infection. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether online fresh food shopping behaviors change during public health emergency periods. Design/methodology/approach: The data were collected through a web-based survey (508 respondents in China). Descriptive analysis, ordinal logistic regression analysis, and the Apriori algorithm were employed to explore what characteristics influence purchase frequency as well as food and delivery time preferences among different customer groups. Findings: Based on the survey data, this study found that purchase frequency grew 71.2% during the COVID-19 crisis. City type and online shopping frequency of respondents are positively correlated with purchase frequency in normal and COVID-19 crisis periods. Number of daily hours worked by respondents only showed a significant impact for the normal period. People perceiving the risk of infection from going out are more willing to purchase fresh food online. Originality/value: This is the first study to explore and compare online fresh food shopping behaviors during normal and COVID-19 crisis periods with a sample from China. The findings indicate a key role that online fresh food shopping can perform during a crisis and contribute to our understanding of fresh food online shopping behaviors during other possible public health emergency scenarios. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Lu, M.; Wang, R.; Li, P.",British Food Journal,661,1

A systematic search of Scopus and PubMed databases was performed to identify clinical and preclinical studies on this argument;2463 papers were identified and 133 studies were included. Regarding HCQ activity against COVID-19, it was noticed that despite the first data were promising, the latest outcomes highlighted the ineffectiveness of HCQ in the treatment of viral infection. Several trials have seen that HCQ administration did not improve severe illness and did not prevent the infection outbreak after virus exposure. By contrast, HCQ arises as a first-line treatment in managing autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus erythematosus, and Sjogren syndrome. It also improves glucose and lipid homeostasis and reveals significant antibacterial activity.","Faraone, I.; Labanca, F.; Ponticelli, M.; Tommasi, N. de Milella L.",Molecules,661,10

However, these three time use behaviours are co-dependent parts of the 24-hour day (spending time in one leaves less time for the others), and their best balance for cognitive function in older adults is still largely unknown. This systematic review summarises the existing evidence on the associations between combinations of two or more time-use behaviours and cognitive function in older adults. Embase, Pubmed, PsycInfo, Medline and Emcare databases were searched in March 2020 and updated in May 2021, returning a total of 25,289 papers for screening. A total of 23 studies were included in the synthesis, spanning >23,000 participants (mean age 71 years). Findings support previous evidence that spending more time in physical activity and limiting sedentary behaviour is broadly associated with better cognitive outcomes in older adults. Higher proportions of moderate-vigorous physical activity in the day were most frequently associated with better cognitive function. Some evidence suggests that certain types of sedentary behaviour may be positively associated with cognitive function, such as reading or computer use. Sleep duration appears to share an inverted U-shaped relationship with cognition, as too much or too little sleep is negatively associated with cognitive function. This review highlights considerable heterogeneity in methodological and statistical approaches, and encourages a more standardised, transparent approach to capturing important daily behaviours in older adults. Investigating all three time-use behaviours together against cognitive function using suitable statistical methodology is strongly recommended to further our understanding of optimal 24-hour time-use for brain function in aging.","Mellow, M.

METHODS: A total of 5256 cancer patients registered from May 2020 to March 2021. There were 681 cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Forty-five thoracic malignancy patients were enrolled. Data from medical records were obtained at the Dharmais Cancer Hospital, then analyzed using SPSS version 25. Comparative result was considered significant, as p < 0.05. RESULTS: There were 12.9% of total patients registered infected by COVID-19, which 6% with thoracic malignancy dominated by non-small cell lung carcinoma (57.8%). Patients who have asymptomatic (31.1%), mild (13.3%), and moderate COVID-19 disease (8.9%) were alive. Patient with severe disease (46.7%) tends to deteriorate.

We identified metabolic genes and pathways and reporter metabolites under each SARS-CoV-2-infected condition and compared them to identify common and unique changes in the metabolism. Our analysis revealed host-dependent dysregulation of glycolysis, mitochondrial metabolism, amino acid metabolism, glutathione metabolism, polyamine synthesis, and lipid metabolism. We observed different metabolic changes that are pro- and antiviral in nature. We generated hypotheses on how antiviral metabolism can be targeted/enhanced for reducing viral titers. These warrant further exploration with more samples and in vitro studies to test predictions.","Moolamalla, S T R; Chauhan, Ruchi; Deva Priyakumar, U; Vinod, P K",bioRxiv,661,23

In this study, we interrogated COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in the country by deploying a nationwide open-access online survey, two months before the rollout of the national vaccination program. The Health Belief Model (HBM) posits that people are likely to adopt disease prevention behaviors and to accept medical interventions like vaccines if there is sufficient motivation and cues to action. A majority of our 7,193 respondents (62.5%) indicated that they were willing to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Moreover, multivariable analysis revealed that HBM constructs were associated with vaccination intention in the Philippines. Perceptions of high susceptibility, high severity, and significant benefits were all good predictors for vaccination intent. We also found that external cues to action were important. Large majorities of our respondents would only receive the COVID-19 vaccines after many others had received it (72.8%) or after politicians had received it (68.2%). Finally, our study revealed that most (21%) were willing to pay an amount of PHP1,000 [USD20] for the COVID-19 vaccines with an average willing-to-pay amount of PHP1,892 [USD38].","Caple, A.; Dimaano, A.; Sagolili, M.

Materials and Methods We used the American ECD approach but made modifications. Our approach included 1) a review of data, 2) a review of current admission practice via consultations with nurses, 3) a review of evidence and policies, 4) workshops with nursing and informatics teams in partnership with the eMR vendor, and 5) team debrief sessions to consolidate findings and decide what data elements should be kept, moved, or removed from the admission form. Results Of 165 data elements in the form, 32% (n=53) had 0% usage, while 25% (n=43) had 100% usage. Nurses perceptions of the form purpose varied. Eight policy documents specifically prescribed data to be noted at admission. Workshops revealed risks of moving or removing data elements, but also uncovered ways of streamlining the form. Consolidation of findings from all phases resulted in a recommendation to reduce 91% of data elements. Discussion Application of a modified ECD approach allowed the team to identify opportunities for significantly reducing and reorganizing data elements in the eMR to enhance the utility, quality, visibility, and value of nursing admission data. Conclusion We found the modified ECD approach effective for identifying data elements and work processes that were unnecessary and duplicated. Our findings and methodology can inform improvements in nursing clinical practice, information management, and governance in a digital health age.","Shala, D.

Europe and the U.S. have refrained from a centralized contact tracing method that involve GPS data collection and used a minimalist approach utilizing apps based on Google and Apple's Application Programming Interface (API) enabled by Bluetooth technology downloadable only voluntary by citizens, with western European countries striving to abide by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), in turn failing to flatten the curve earlier on during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This paper illustrates word-formation approaches and semantic webs of COVID-19 vocabulary that is said to number more than 1000 new words;it also discusses significant events that created ‘coroneologisms’. In this connection, the paper takes a corpus-based approach towards content analysis and semantic relationship networks by studying the massive data associated with the pandemic: news reports, government documents, international policies, science papers, social media posts and others. Three online mega-corpora and self-collected data were analysed from the lexicological perspective, including affixation, compounding, blending, acronyms, and word meanings associated with common words. The paper also reifies the efforts of lexicographers, especially those of the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), in recording this unprecedented catastrophe in human history. In using the semantic web, aspects of language are shown to have developed during this period. The broader purpose is to ascertain how language, as a social enterprise, has changed in tandem with empirically ascertainable social, political and scientific changes during the pandemic.

These processes drive the accumulation of intracellular cyclic-di-nucleotides such as cyclic-di-GMP (CDG). Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) are critical drivers of type 2 lung inflammation during fungal allergen exposure in mice; however, it is unclear how CDG regulates lung ILC responses during lung inflammation. Here, we show that CDG induced early airway type 1 interferon (IFN) production and dramatically suppressed both lung proliferating CD127+ST2+ ILC2s and Alternaria- and IL-33-induced lung inflammation. Further, transcriptomic analysis of CD127−ST2− Thy1.2+ ILCs, which were expanded and activated by CDG, revealed an ILC1 signature. CDG administration led to accumulation of IFNγ+ and T-bet+ ILC1s, as well as neutrophilia, independent of IL-18R, IL-12, and STAT6 but dependent on stimulator of interferon genes (STING) and partially dependent on type 1 IFN signaling. Thus, CDG potently suppresses ILC2-driven lung inflammation and promotes ILC1 responses. These results suggest potential therapeutic modulation of STING to suppress type 2 inflammation and/or increase anti-viral responses during respiratory infections.","Cavagnero, Kellen J.; Badrani, Jana H.; Naji, Luay H.; Amadeo, Michael B.; Leng, Anthea S.; Lacasa, Lee Diego; Strohm, Allyssa N.; Doherty, Taylor A.",bioRxiv,661,1

However, the extant literature lacks causal evidence about whether anti-corruption interventions can improve health outcomes. We examine the impact of randomized anti-corruption audits on early-life mortality in Brazil. Methods: The Brazilian government conducted audits in 1,949 randomly selected municipalities between 2003 and 2015. To identify the causal effect of anti-corruption audits on early-life mortality, we analyse data on health outcomes from individual- level vital statistics (DATASUS) collected by Brazil government before and after the random audits. Data on the audit intervention are from the Controladoria-Geral da Uniao, the government agency responsible for the anti-corruption audits. Outcomes are neonatal mortality, infant mortality, child mortality, preterm births, and prenatal visits. Analyses examine aggregate effects for each outcome, as well as effects by race, cause of death, and years since the intervention. Results: Anti-corruption audits significantly decreased early-life mortality in Brazil. Expressed in relative terms, audits reduced neonatal mortality by 6.7% (95% CI -8.3%, -5.0%), reduced infant mortality by 7.3% (-8.6%, -5.9%), and reduced child mortality by 7.3% (-8.5%, -6.0%). This reduction in early mortality was higher for nonwhite Brazilians, who face significant health disparities. Effects are greater when we look at deaths from preventable causes, and show temporal persistence with large effects even a decade after audits. In addition, analyses show that the intervention led to a 12.1% (-13.4%, -10.6%) reduction in women receiving no prenatal care, as well as a 7.4% (-9.4%, -5.5%) reduction in preterm births; these effects are likewise higher for nonwhites and are persistent over time. All effects are robust to various alternative specifications. Interpretation: Governments have the potential to improve health outcomes through anti-corruption interventions. Such interventions can reduce early-life mortality and mitigate health disparities. The impact of anti-corruption audits should be investigated in other countries, and further research should further explore the mechanisms by which combating corruption affects the health sector.","Ramos, A.

In doing so we directly address crisis induced financial concerns and how they played out in the context of ethnicity. Design/methodology/approach Using the most recent ten quarterly waves of the UK SME Finance Monitor survey the authors consider whether ethnicity of the business owner impacts on the decision to apply for bank loans in the first instance. The authors then question whether ethnicity influences the banks decision to meet or reject the request for a bank loan. Findings The authors' pre-COVID-19 results show that there were no ethnic differences in loan application and success rates. During COVID-19, both white and ethnic business loan application rates rose significantly, but the scale of this increase was greater for ethnic businesses. The presence of government 100% guaranteed lending also increased general loan success rates, but again the scale of this improvement was greater for ethnic businesses. Research limitations/implications The authors show very clearly that differences in the willingness of banks to supply loans to SMEs relate very explicitly to firm specific characteristics and ethnicity either plays no additional role or actually leads to improved loan outcomes. The data is for the UK and for a very unique COVID time which may mean that wider generalisability is unwise. Practical implications Ethnic business owners should not worry about lending discrimination or be discouraged from applying for loans. Social implications The authors identify at worst no lending discrimination and at best positive ethnic discrimination.

It is this soft inside which has made the traditional perimeter model laughable to attackers, who can easily breach a network and run away with the data without even having to deal with the hardened perimeter. The zero-trust security model, created by John Kindervag in 2010, addresses the security flaws of the traditional perimeter model and asserts that all network traffic on the inside should not be trusted by default. Other core principles of zero trust include verification and continuous monitoring of all communication, as well as encryption of all data in transit and data at rest, since the goal of zero trust is to focus on protecting data. Although the zero-trust model was created in 2010, with some of the associated security practices existing even before that, many healthcare organisations are still choosing to focus primarily on securing the perimeter instead of focusing on the vulnerabilities within them. The current COVID-19 pandemic which healthcare providers are struggling with further highlights the need for improvements to security within the network perimeter, as many healthcare providers and vaccine developers are still using vulnerable, outdated legacy systems which could become compromised and indirectly have a detrimental effect on patient care. Legacy systems which are technologically limited, as well as medical devices which cannot be controlled or managed by network administrators, create boundaries to transitioning to a zero-trust architecture. It is challenges like this that have been explored during the research phase of this project in order to gain a better understanding of how a health organisation can adopt zero-trust practices despite the limitations of their current architecture. From the information gathered during this research, a framework was developed to allow a health organisation to transition to a more secure architecture based on the concept of zero-trust. Aspects of the proposed framework were tested in Cisco Modelling Labs (CML), and the results were evaluated to ensure the validity of some of the recommendations laid out in the framework. The main objective of this research was to prove that if a host within the local area network (LAN) were to be compromised, the damage would be limited to that host and would not spread throughout the rest of the network. This was successful after the qualitative research performed in CML. One of the other takeaways from testing the framework in CML was that medical devices could be secured by placing firewalls directly in front of them. This placement of firewalls may seem like an unorthodox approach and was shown to increase latency, but the blocking of all unnecessary traffic on the rest of the network will result in a performance boost and should balance it out in a real-world application. © 2021 by the authors.

However, there is a lack of scientific measurement of the influence on passengers’ PT dependence (PTD) during emergent public health events. Methods An extended theory of planned behaviour and an online survey scheme are proposed to investigate the influence of psychological and objective factors on passengers’ PTD under an emergent public health event in Beijing, China. Then, four structural equation models are estimated to analyse the PTD influence mechanism of different groups of passengers. Results The objective condition factors exert indirect effects on passengers' PTD via the psychological factors. Individual attributes have small influences on passengers' PTD, while the environment has a significant positive effect. Subjective norms have the highest influencing effect on passengers’ PTD, and passengers with a relatively high PTD level have the risk of shifting to other transportation modes under the emergent public health events. Conclusions The influence mechanism of emergency public health events on the PT dependence of different passengers is heterogeneous. The targeted policies should be implemented for different passengers to improve the PT market share and residents' health under emergent public health events.","Hu, Song Lin Pengfei Weng Jiancheng Zhou Wei",Journal of Transport &amp; Health,661,16

Vaccines are being deployed all over the world with good efficacy, but there is no approved antiviral treatment to date. This is particularly needed since the emergence of variants and the potential immune escape may prolong pandemic spreading of the infection for much longer than anticipated. Here, we developed a series of small molecules and identified RG10 as a potent antiviral compound against SARS-CoV-2 in cell lines and human airway epithelia (HAE). RG10 localizes to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes, perturbing ER morphology and inducing ER stress. Yet, RG10 does not associate with SARS-CoV-2 replication sites although preventing virus replication. To further investigate the antiviral properties of our compound, we developed fluorescent SARS-CoV-2 viral particles allowing us to track virus arrival to ER membranes. Live cell imaging of replication-competent virus infection revealed that RG10 stalls the intracellular virus-ER dynamics. Finally, we synthesized RG10b, a stable version of RG10, that showed increased potency in vitro and in HAE with a pharmacokinetic half-life greater than 2 h. Together, our work reports on a novel fluorescent virus model and innovative antiviral strategy consisting of the perturbation of ER/virus dynamics, highlighting the promising antiviral properties of RG10 and RG10b.","Bakhache, William; Partiot, Emma; Lucansky, Vincent; Bare, Yonis; Bonaventure, Boris; Goujon, Caroline; Bories, Cédric; Deffieu, Maika S.; Gaudin, Raphael",bioRxiv,661,1

Especially poor interface design can increase the cognitive load that ultimately affects the learner's intention to use. The design aspects that could be convenient, useful, and trustworthy in an online learning context are an emerging challenge and the primary purpose behind this study. So, in current research, the effect of different design aspects or attributes (i.e., interactivity, information, navigation, and visual) have been examined on learners' cognitive beliefs (i.e., ease of use and usefulness), trust, and ultimately intention to use. The proposed model was used to determine the learner's intention to use via trust, cognitive beliefs, and design aspects. Data was collected from the students at different Universities in Punjab, Pakistan, using a questionnaire embedded in an online learning prototype. PLS-SEM method was employed for analysis using the SmartPLS tool. The findings show that among the used design attributes, interaction, information, and visual design significantly influence the learner's cognitive beliefs, where navigation partially influences the cognitive beliefs. Furthermore, both cognitive beliefs (i.e., ease of use and usefulness) were observed to be strong determinants of trust. This study importantly contributes to the e-learning domain by providing a comprehensive understanding of learners' perceptions and experiences related to interface design that leads to intention to use.","Younas, A.; Faisal, C.

Our results showed stroke and systemic thromboembolism in 88 of 4258 (2.06%) patients in the rivaroxaban group compared to 351 of 18878 (1.85%) patients in the warfarin group (RR 0.76; 95% CI, 0.55, 1.06; heterogeneity I2 = 35%, P = 0.10), major bleeding in 247 of 4258 (5.8%) patients in the rivaroxaban group compared to 270 of 18879 (1.4%) patients in the warfarin group (HR 1.68; 95% CI, 0.59, 4.77; heterogeneity I2 = 97%) and intracranial hemorrhage in 24 out of 2583 (0.9%) patients in the rivaroxaban group compared to 35 of 2160 (1.6%) in warfarin group (HR 0.49; 95% CI, 0.16, 1.56; heterogeneity I2 = 70%). Conclusions: Our results show that rivaroxaban is comparable to warfarin in prevention of stroke and systemic thromboembolism in patients with NVAF with VHD. Rivaroxaban is also comparable to warfarin in bleeding risks in these patients.","Baral, N.; Katel, A.; Adhikari, G.; Khan, M. R.; Khan, H. M.

Objectives: Our aim was to explore new associations between coronavirus infections and vasculitis utilizing semantic mining of PubMed results. Methods: The following literature search string: (vasculitis OR vascular inflammation OR vascular damage) AND (coronavirus OR SARS virus OR MERS-CoV OR Covid-19) was used to retrieve abstracts from the whole PubMed database, using Semantic MEDLINE 2. on 6/7/2020. This application represents a network of semantic predications (triples of the form subject-predicate-object, e.g. COVID-19 causes Disease) on a knowledge graph. The system allows for choosing the maximum number of nodes represented, the central topic, and the length of the network. For our network we chose to display all relations, COVID-19 (31 edges) as the central term, 3 lengths, and selecting the most informative nodes. Automatic summarization eliminated the less informative predications. Results: The search string retrieved 152 citations from PubMed and identified 1,028 predications. The network (Figure 1), displayed using COVID-19 as the central term, consisted of 72 nodes and 140 edges. The 5 most connected nodes were 'Patients: 19 nodes', COVID-19: 13', 'Inflammation: 13', 'Lung: 11', and 'Disease: 11'. Multiple links have been found between coronavirus and vasculitis. Animal coronaviruses, including the one causing feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), the SARS-CoV in transgenic mice and coronavirus in ferrets, are known to cause vasculitis in animals. It is known that coronaviruses that infect animals can evolve and become new human coronaviruses. SARS produces inflammation in blood vessels. In 2005, a link between the coronavirus HCoV-NL63 or New Haven Coronavirus (HCoV-NH) and KD was reported, although later studies concluded that HCoV-NH did not play a dominant role in the etiology or pathogenesis of KD. In 2014, serological testing suggested the possible involvement of CoV-229E in the development of KD. There has also been a report of KD patients being infected by coronavirus OC43/HKU1.COVID-19 may infect the vessels and trigger inflammatory reactions like those of vasculitis, including vasculitis-like cutaneous lesions. COVID-19 patients develop thrombosis, and increased risk of thrombosis is also present in primary vasculitic syndromes. Children, many of whom tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies, developed Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), an inflammatory condition similar to Kawasaki Disease (KD). Conclusion: Knowledge integration and discovery methods are an efficient and powerful way of retrieving and analyzing relevan information from multiple papers. Their main advantages are finding relations among biomedical concepts, generating new hypotheses, and opening them to literature-based discovery. SARS-CoV-2 may cause vasculitis or vasculitis-like syndromes. The KD-like syndrome reported mainly in children with COVID-19 revives the previous suspicion of coronavirus as a possible triggering agent of KD and the decades-old hypothesis of infection involvement in the pathogenesis of vasculitis.","Rodriguez-Pla, A.; Cartin-Ceba, R.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,661,26

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a disorder that can occur after exposure to a traumatic event. Objectives. This study is designed to evaluate PTSD in front-line and non-front-line medical staff who provide care for COVID-19 patients. Material and methods. This cross-sectional study was conducted on 200 medical staff in two hospitals of Ahvaz. The inclusion criterion was having more than six months of service. Health providers with psychological disorders, a history of crises in the past six months or divorced subjects were excluded from the study. A demographic questionnaire and the PTSD questionnaire were completed by participants. The Independent t-Test, chi-square test and linear regression were used to analyze the data. Results. The total score of PTSD was 50.08 +/- 12.24 and 44.06 +/- 11.32 in front-line and non-front-line medical staff, respectively (p &lt; 0.001). 10% and 1% of front-line and non-front-line medical staff had severe PTSD, respectively. Females were 7.47 times more likely to have PTSD compared to males. Medical staff who had a child were 6 times more likely to have PTSD compared with those without a child. Medical staff involved in the care of COVID-19 patients were 5.67 times more likely to have PTSD (p &lt; 0.001). Health providers whose relatives died from COVID-19 were 10.59 times more likely to have PTSD. Conclusions. The results of this study showed that front-line medical staff are more susceptible to PTSD in comparison to non-front-line medical staff. Health policymakers should pay attention to the psychological health of medical staff in times of crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Askari, S.; Beheshtinasab, M.; Ghanbari, S.; Bahmaei, H.; Boostani, H.; Afshari, P.; Abedi, P.",Family Medicine and Primary Care Review,661,32

Even before the pandemic, the work flexibility was encouraged and stimulated in Romania by the promotion of the telework law, becoming an important factor for both employees and employers. In this context, the main goal of this paper is to test if and to what extent teleworking, as an important source of workspace flexibility can impact the way in which Romanian employees self-evaluate their level of satisfaction. In order to reach our goal, the analysis is structured into three main stages. In the first stage an aggregated indicator entitled “employee workspace flexibility composite indicator” is proposed and constructed. This indicator constructed with the help of the MCA technique (multiple correspondence analysis), using the information collected with a national level representative survey for the population of Romanian employees, is further used in logistic models with the purpose of identifying the influence of the flexibility on satisfaction. In the third stage, the main differences between subgroups are identified. The main findings support the idea that flexibility is a significant factor contributing to the increase of satisfaction, and also differences depending on region, sector and form of company. © 2021, Amfiteatru Economic.

The algorithm is built on the sensitivity matrix analysis using the methods of differential and linear algebra. It allows one to determine the parameters that are the least and most sensitive to data changes to build a regularization for solving an identification problem of the most accurate pandemic spread scenarios in the region. The performed analysis has demonstrated that the virus contagiousness is identifiable from the number of daily confirmed, critical and recovery cases. On the other hand, the predicted proportion of the admitted patients who require a ventilator and the mortality rate are determined much less consistently. It has been shown that building a more realistic forecast requires adding additional information about the process such as the number of daily hospital admissions. In our study, the problems of parameter identification using additional information about the number of daily confirmed, critical and mortality cases in the region were reduced to minimizing the corresponding misfit functions. The minimization problem was solved through the differential evolution method that is widely applied for stochastic global optimization. It has been demonstrated that a more general COVID-19 spread compartmental model consisting of seven ordinary differential equations describes the main trend of the spread and is sensitive to the peaks of confirmed cases but does not qualitatively describe small statistical datasets such as the number of daily critical cases or mortality that can lead to errors in forecasting. A more detailed agent-oriented model has been able to capture statistical data with additional noise to build scenarios of COVID-19 spread in the region.","Krivorotko, O. I.; Kabanikhin, S.

In response to the crisis, rapid, adaptive, technological and social innovations have started to emerge across all levels of society, opening up a multiplicity of alternative futures. This is an opportune time to address long-standing and urgent sustainability challenges in ways that move beyond the ineffective and business-as-usual approaches of ecological modernism. The authors used a co-creative process to identify weak signals relevant to sustainability transformations. In alignment with the deep leverage points framework, the identified weak signals are presented under two main headings: First, social structures and institutions;and second, values, goals and worldviews.

Previous research has shown disparities in COVID-19 vaccination uptake among HCWs based on ethnicity, job role, sex, age, and deprivation. However, vaccine attitudes underpinning these variations are yet to be fully explored. Methods We conducted a qualitative study with 164 HCWs from different ethnicities, sexes, job roles, migration statuses, and regions in the United Kingdom (UK). Interviews and focus groups were conducted using Microsoft Teams or telephone, and recorded with participants' permission. Recordings were transcribed and thematically analysed following an inductive approach. Findings We conducted an in-depth analysis of 53 randomly selected transcripts (involving 82 participants) to generate rapid evidence. Four different vaccine attitudes were identified: Active Acceptance, Passive Acceptance, Passive Decline, and Active Decline. Factors influencing vaccine acceptance include: knowledge of vaccine; risk perception; positive attitude towards other vaccines; social influences; and considerations about the future. Correspondingly, barriers to vaccine acceptance were identified as, low trust in the vaccine and historical (mis)trust, inadequate communication, and inequities in delivery and access. Opinion on mandatory vaccination was divided. Interpretation Our data show that vaccine attitudes are diverse and elements of hesitancy may remain even after vaccine acceptance. This has implications for the sustainability of the vaccine programme, particularly as new components (e.g. boosters) are being added. Based on our findings we recommend trust-building, designing inclusive and accessible information, and addressing structural inequities for improving vaccine uptake among HCWs.

Parasite accumulation is primarily mediated by P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane 1 (PfEMP1). Magnitude of IgG to pRBCs has been associated with reduced risk of MiP in some studies, but associations have been inconsistent. Further, antibody effector mechanisms are poorly understood, and the role of antibody complement interactions is unknown. Methods: Studying a longitudinal cohort of pregnant women (n=302) from a malaria-endemic province in Papua New Guinea (PNG), we measured the ability of antibodies to fix and activate complement using placental binding pRBCs and PfEMP1 recombinant domains. We determined antibody-mediated complement inhibition of pRBC binding to the placental receptor, chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) and associations with protection against placental parasitaemia. Results: Some women acquired antibodies that effectively promoted complement fixation on placental-binding pRBCs. Complement fixation correlated with IgG1 and IgG3 antibodies, which dominated the response. There was, however, limited evidence for membrane attack complex activity or pRBC lysis or killing. Importantly, a higher magnitude of complement fixing antibodies was prospectively associated with reduced odds of placental infection at delivery. Using genetically-modified P. falciparum and recombinant PfEMP1 domains, we found that complement-fixing antibodies primarily targeted a specific variant of PfEMP1 (known as VAR2CSA). Furthermore, complement enhanced the ability of antibodies to inhibit pRBC binding to CSA, which was primarily mediated by complement C1q protein. Conclusion: These findings provide new insights into mechanisms mediating immunity to MiP and reveal potential new strategies for developing malaria vaccines that harness antibody-complement interactions.","Opi, D.

Question Pool websites (QPs) such as LeetCode, Code Chef, and Math Playground help PBL by supplying authentic, diverse, and contextualized questions to students. Nonetheless, empirical findings suggest that 40% to 80% of students registered in QPs drop out in less than two months. This research is the first attempt to understand and predict student dropouts from QPs via exploiting students' engagement moods. Adopting a data-driven approach, we identify five different engagement moods for QP students, which are namely challenge-seeker, subject-seeker, interest-seeker, joy-seeker, and non-seeker. We find that students have collective preferences for answering questions in each engagement mood, and deviation from those preferences increases their probability of dropping out significantly. Last but not least, this paper contributes by introducing a new hybrid machine learning model (we call Dropout-Plus) for predicting student dropouts in QPs. The test results on a popular QP in China, with nearly 10K students, show that Dropout-Plus can exceed the rival algorithms' dropout prediction performance in terms of accuracy, F1-measure, and AUC.

Such an overlapping set of patent rights may have restrictive effects on further research and development of diagnostic tests, and the provision of clinical diagnostic services. Currently, two models that may facilitate access to and use of patented genetic inventions are attracting much debate in various national and international fora: patent pools and clearing houses. In this article, we explore the concept of clearing houses. Several types of clearing houses are identified. First, we describe and discuss two types that would provide access to information on the patented inventions: the information clearing house and the technology exchange clearing house. Second, three types of clearing houses are analysed that not only offer access to information but also provide an instrument to facilitate the use of the patented inventions: the open access clearing house, the standardized licences clearing house and the royalty collection clearing house. A royalty collection clearing house for genetic diagnostic testing would be the most comprehensive as it would serve several functions: identifying patents and patent claims essential to diagnostic testing, matching licensees with licensors, developing and supplying standardized licences, collecting royalties, monitoring whether users respect licensing conditions, and providing dispute resolution services such as mediation and arbitration. In this way, it might function as an effective model for users to facilitate access to and use of the patented inventions. However, it remains to be seen whether patent holders with a strong patent portfolio will be convinced by the advantages of the royalty collection clearing house and be willing to participate.","van Zimmeren, Esther; Verbeure, Birgit; Matthijs, Gert; Van Overwalle, Geertrui",Bulletin of the World Health Organization,661,11

The aim of this study was to compare the performances of several molecular assays, including conventional reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), two real-time reverse transcription (rRT)-PCRs, and two multiplex RTPCRs. A total of 381 clinical specimens were collected from patients (223 men and 158 women), and both the Seeplex RV7 assay and rRT-PCR were ordered on different specimens within one week after collection. The concordance rate for the two methods was 87% (332/381), and the discrepancy rate was 13% (49/381). The positive rates for the molecular assays studied included 93.1% for the multiplex Seeplex RV7 assay, 93.1% for conventional reverse transcription (cRT)-PCR, 89.7% for the multiplex Seeplex Flu ACE Subtyping assay, 82.8% for protocol B rRT-PCR, and 58.6% for protocol A rRT-PCR. Our results showed that the multiplex Seeplex assays and the cRT-PCR yielded higher detection rates than rRT-PCRs for detecting the influenza A (H1N1) virus. Although the multiplex Seeplex assays had the advantage of simultaneous detection of several viruses, they were time-consuming and troublesome. Our results show that, although rRTPCR had the advantage, the detection rates of the molecular assays varied depending upon the source of the influenza A (H1N1)v virus. Our findings also suggest that rRT-PCR sometimes detected virus in extremely low abundance and thus required validation of analytical performance and clinical correlation.","Lee, Mi Kyung; Kim, Hye Ryoun",Journal of microbiology and biotechnology,661,6

It has now been well-demonstrated that both outer membrane proteins and restriction fragment analysis of the bacterial genomes of concomitant nasopharyngeal and middle ear effusion isolates of NTHI are identical. It is therefore of critical importance to understand the mechanisms whereby bacteria that are present in normal healthy children in small numbers become the predominant organism in the nasopharynx in otitis media. The studies presented here suggest that nontypable Haemophilus influenzae can effectively decrease ciliary function as measured by stroboscopic illumination of ciliary beat frequency on human adenoidal organ culture. This organism also produces significant histopathologic and ultrastructural damage to the epithelial cells and cilia of adenoid organ culture, demonstrated by both light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The data suggest the following hypothesis: nontypable Haemophilus influenzae can destroy mucociliary function and allow increased bacterial replication in the mucus overlying the nasopharyngeal mucosa. The mucociliary system of the eustachian tube may also be involved in a similar manner, thus allowing bacteria to enter the middle ear space via the eustachian tube.","Bernstein, J M; Hard, R; Cui, Z D; So, N; Fisher, J; Ogra, P L",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,661,1

Although this infection has been described in captive and free-ranging wild felids from Europe, Asia, North America, and Africa, no information is available on its occurrence among wild felids of Brazil. In this study, 250 serum samples of six species of Brazilian captive wild felids (Leopardus tigrinus, Leopardus wiedii, Herpailurus yaguarondi, Puma concolor, Leopardus pardalis, and Panthera onca) were examined for neutralizing antibodies to feline herpesvirus type 1. Positive sera were found in 72% of L. tigrinus samples, 15% of L. wiedii, 6% of L. pardalis, 8% of H. yaguarondi, 18% of P. concolor, and 14% of P. onca. The relatively low percentages of seropositivity and low antibody titers found among the last five species suggest that feline herpesvirus type 1 does not circulate extensively among these animals. Nevertheless, quarantine, serologic screening, and vaccination of newly introduced felids is recommended in zoos in order to prevent virus transmission and outbreaks of the disease among wild felids kept in captivity.","Ruthner Batista, Helena Beatriz de Carvalho; Kindlein Vicentini, Franco; Franco, Ana Cláudia; Rosado Spilki, Fernando; Ramos Silva, Jean Carlos; Adania, Cristina Harumi; Roehe, Paulo Michel",Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,661,1

Indiscriminate use of broad-spectrum antibiotics has seriously affected this situation. With the diminishing discovery of novel antibiotics, new treatment methods are urgently required to combat MDR pathogens. Polymyxins, the cationic lipopeptide antibiotics, discovered more than half a century ago, are considered to be the last-line of antibiotics available at the moment. This antibiotic shows a great bactericidal effect against Gram-negative bacteria. Polymyxins primarily target the bacterial membrane and disrupt them, causing lethality. Because of their membrane interacting mode of action, polymyxins cause nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity in humans, limiting their usability. However, recent modifications in their chemical structure have been able to reduce the toxic effects. The development of better dosing regimens has also helped in getting better clinical outcomes in the infections caused by MDR pathogens. Since the mid1990s the use of polymyxins has increased manifold in clinical settings, resulting in the emergence of polymyxin-resistant strains. The risk posed by the polymyxin-resistant nosocomial pathogens such as the Enterobacteriaceae group, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii, etc. is very serious considering these pathogens are resistant to almost all available antibacterial drugs. In this review article, the mode of action of the polymyxins and the genetic regulatory mechanism responsible for the emergence of resistance are discussed. Specifically, this review aims to update our current understanding in the field and suggest possible solutions that can be pursued for future antibiotic development. As polymyxins primarily target the bacterial membranes, resistance to polymyxins arises primarily by the modification of the lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in the outer membrane (OM). The LPS modification pathways are largely regulated by the bacterial two-component signal transduction (TCS) systems. Therefore, targeting or modulating the TCS signalling mechanisms can be pursued as an alternative to treat the infections caused by polymyxin-resistant MDR pathogens. In this review article, this aspect is also highlighted.","Mohapatra, Saswat S; Dwibedy, Sambit K; Padhy, Indira",Journal of biosciences,661,9

METHODS In the study, the bioinformatics analysis of all the published sequences of SARS-CoV-2 was conducted and thus the high frequency mutation sites were affirmed. Taking advantages of PolyPhen-2, the functional influence of each mutation in S protein was prospected. The 3D homologous modelling was performed by SWISS-MODEL to establish mutated S protein structural model, in which the protein-docking was then implemented with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) and aminopeptidase N (APN) by ZDOCK, and the combining capacity of each mutated S protein evaluated by FiPD. Finally, the binding ability between mutated S proteins and anti-virus drugs were prospected and evaluated through AutoDock-Chimera 1.14. RESULTS The mutations in specific region of S protein had greater tendency to destroy the S protein function by analysis of mutated S protein structure. Protein-receptor docking analysis between naturally mutated S protein and host receptors showed that, in the case of spontaneous mutation, the binding ability of S protein to ACE2 tended to be weakened, while the binding ability of DPP4 tended to be enhanced, and there was no significant change in the binding ability of APN. According to the computational simulation results of affinity binding between small molecular drugs and S protein, the affinity of aplaviroc with S protein was significantly higher than that of other small molecule drug candidates. CONCLUSION The region from 400-1 100 amino acid in S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the mutation sensitive part during natural state, which was more potential to mutate than other part in S protein during natural state. The mutated SARS-CoV-2 might tend to target human cells with DPP4 as a new receptor rather than keep ACE2 as its unique receptor for human infection. At the same time, aplaviroc, which was used for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, may become a new promising treatment for SARS-CoV-2 and could be a potential choice for the development of SARS-CoV-2 drugs.","Cao, Z; Wang, L T; Liu, Z M",Beijing da xue xue bao.

As the National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine is the primary medical care center for COVID-19 in Zhejiang province. Based on the present expert consensus carried out by National Health Commission and National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, our team summarized and established an effective treatment strategy centered on ""Four-Anti and Two-Balance"" for clinical practice. The ""Four-Anti and Two-Balance"" strategy included antivirus, anti-shock, anti-hyoxemia, anti-secondary infection, and maintaining of water, electrolyte and acid base balance and microecological balance. Meanwhile, integrated multidisciplinary personalized treatment was recommended to improve therapeutic effect. The importance of early viralogical detection, dynamic monitoring of inflammatory indexes and chest radiograph was emphasized in clinical decision-making. Sputum was observed with the highest positive rate of RT-PCR results. Viral nucleic acids could be detected in 10%patients' blood samples at acute period and 50%of patients had positive RT-PCR results in their feces. We also isolated alive viral strains from feces, indicating potential infectiousness of feces.Dynamic cytokine detection was necessary to timely identifying cytokine storms and application of artificial liver blood purification system. The ""Four-Anti and Two-Balance"" strategy effectively increased cure rate and reduced mortality. Early antiviral treatment could alleviate disease severity and prevent illness progression, and we found lopinavir/ritonavir combined with abidol showed antiviral effects in COVID-19. Shock and hypoxemia were usually caused by cytokine storms. The artificial liver blood purification system could rapidly remove inflammatory mediators and block cytokine storm.Moreover, it also favored the balance of fluid, electrolyte and acid-base and thus improved treatment efficacy in critical illness. For cases of severe illness, early and also short period of moderate glucocorticoid was supported. Patients with oxygenation index below 200 mmHg should be transferred to intensive medical center. Conservative oxygen therapy was preferred and noninvasive ventilation was not recommended. Patients with mechanical ventilation should be strictly supervised with cluster ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention strategies. Antimicrobial prophylaxis was not recommended except for patients with long course of disease, repeated fever and elevated procalcitonin (PCT), meanwhile secondary fungal infection should be concerned.Some patients with COVID-19 showed intestinal microbial dysbiosis with decreased probiotics such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, so nutritional and gastrointestinal function should be assessed for all patients.Nutritional support and application of prebiotics or probiotics were suggested to regulate the balance of intestinal microbiota and reduce the risk of secondary infection due to bacterial translocation. Anxiety and fear were common in patients with COVID-19. Therefore,we established dynamic assessment and warning for psychological crisis. We also integrated Chinese medicine in treatment to promote disease rehabilitation through classification methods of traditional Chinese medicine. We optimized nursing process for severe patients to promote their rehabilitation. It remained unclear about viral clearance pattern after the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Therefore, two weeks' quarantine for discharged patients was required and a regular following up was also needed.The Zhejiang experience and suggestions have been implemented in our center and achieved good results. However, since COVID-19 was a newly emerging disease, more work was warranted to improve strategies of prevention, diagnosis and treatment for COVID-19.","Xu, Kaijin; Cai, Hongliu; Shen, Yihong; Ni, Qin; Chen, Yu; Hu, Shaohua; Li, Jianping; Wang, Huafen; Yu, Liang; Huang, He; Qiu, Yunqing; Wei, Guoqing; Fang, Qiang; Zhou, Jianying; Sheng, Jifang; Liang, Tingbo; Li, Lanjuan",Zhejiang da xue xue bao.

It has recently been demonstrated, in an experimental model using WNV strain Sarafend and C57BL/6 mice, that both virus- and immune-mediated pathology is involved in WNV encephalitis, with CD8(+) T cells being the dominant subpopulation of lymphocyte infiltrates in the brain. Here, the role of activated WNV-immune CD8(+) T cells in mouse WNV encephalitis was investigated further. Passive transfer of WNV-immune CD8(+) T cells reduced mortality significantly and prolonged survival times of mice infected with WNV. Early infiltration of WNV-immune CD8(+) T cells into infected brains is shown, suggesting a beneficial contribution of these lymphocytes to recovery from encephalitis. This antiviral function was not markedly mediated by gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), as a deficiency in IFN-gamma did not affect mortality to two strains of WNV (Sarafend and Kunjin) or brain virus titres significantly. The cytolytic potential, as well as precursor frequency, of WNV-immune CD8(+) T cells were not altered by the absence of IFN-gamma. This was reflected in transfer experiments of WNV-immune CD8(+) T cells from IFN-gamma(-/-) mice into WNV-infected wild-type mice, which showed that IFN-gamma-deficient T cells were as effective as those from WNV-immune wild-type mice in ameliorating disease outcome. It is speculated here that one of the pleiotropic functions of IFN-gamma is mimicked by WNV-Sarafend-mediated upregulation of cell-surface expression of major histocompatibility complex antigens, which may explain the lack of phenotype of IFN-gamma(-/-) mice in response to WNV.","Wang, Yang; Lobigs, Mario; Lee, Eva; Koskinen, Aulikki; Müllbacher, Arno",The Journal of general virology,661,9

New studies will be reviewed that have identified some of the causes for treatment failures including the type of pathogen and discordant antimicrobial therapy. It will also discuss newly recognised and emerging infectious diseases that may result in progressive or nonresponding pneumonia including severe acute respiratory syndrome, avian influenzae, severe group A streptococcal disease, and community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Promising treatments have been identified for patients with progressive pneumonia due to an overwhelming host immune response including activated protein C and intravenous immunoglobulin. SUMMARY Both progressive and nonresolving pneumonia represent treatment failure as a result of inappropriate initial therapy, a noninfectious cause, or an overwhelming immune response.

METHODS Forty-one medical care workers (aged 23 - 55 years, with a average of 32 years; men/women = 8/32) who were admitted to our hospital and diagnosed with SARS during March and April, 2003 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS Thirteen of all the patients were physicians and the rest were nurses. The disease was mainly transmitted through air droplet in a short distance, and overwork induced tiredness was involved in disease stimulation. Seventy-three percent of the patients presented fever as their first symptom. Ten patients complained inertia and myalgia. One patient showed no clinical symptoms, and bilateral infiltrates was found in his chest X-ray. Among the 41 cases, 6 (15%) were diagnosed as severe type. At the first week, the counts of white blood cells (WBCs), lymphocyte and platelets were (4.4 +/- 1.5) x 10(9)/L, 0.22 +/- 0.12 and (143 +/- 37) x 10(9)/L, which were significantly lower when compared with those at the 2nd to 4th week. Abnormal liver function was found in 27 cases (mostly with elevated serum ALT), with 70% occurred at the 3rd or 4th week. In terms of CT, 30 patients (73%) showed pathological changes in lungs, and bilateral lung involvement was found in 35.59%. Of 36 cases treated with steroids, 86% received middle or low dosage (80 - 240 mg/d). Artificial ventilation was used for twenty-seven patients, and air pipe mechanical ventilation was used for 1 case. Mortality in this study was 5%. CONCLUSIONS Inertia and myalgia may be the earlier symptoms of health care workers with SARS include, which are parallel to CT manifestations. There is no objective index for the assessment of the severity of the disease at early stage. The medicine associated toxicities may be the main reason of liver lesions. damages. Middle or low dosage of steroid was reasonable to be used as early as possible.","Meng, Qing-hua; Zhao, Chun-hui; Dong, Pei-ling; Hu, Zhong-jie; Hou, Wei; Zhang, Ke; Liang, Lian-chun; Huang, Chun",Zhonghua yu fang yi xue za zhi [Chinese journal of preventive medicine],661,16

We studied whether the introduction of negative-strand transcripts of MHV DI RNA would also result in replication. At a location downstream of the T7 promoter and upstream of the human hepatitis delta virus ribozyme domain, we inserted a complete cDNA clone of MHV DI RNA in reverse orientation; in vitro-synthesized RNA from this plasmid yielded a negative-strand RNA copy of the MHV DI RNA. When the negative-strand transcripts of the DI RNA were expressed in MHV-infected cells by a vaccinia virus T7 expression system, positive-strand DI RNAs accumulated in the plasmid-transfected cells. DI RNA replication depended on the expression of T7 polymerase and on the presence of the T7 promoter. Transfection of in vitro-synthesized negative-strand transcripts into MHV-infected cells and serial passage of virus samples from RNA-transfected cells also resulted in accumulation of the DI RNA. Positive-strand DI RNA transcripts were undetectable in sample preparations of the in vitro-synthesized negative-strand DI RNA transcripts, and DI RNA did not accumulate after cotransfection of a small amount of positive-strand DI RNA and truncated-replication-disabled negative-strand transcripts; clearly, the DI RNA replicated from the transfected negative-strand transcripts and not from minute amounts of positive-strand DI RNAs that might be envisioned as artifacts of T7 transcription. Sequence analysis of positive-strand DI RNAs in the cells transfected with negative-strand transcripts showed that DI RNAs maintained the DI-specific unique sequences introduced within the leader sequence. These data indicated that positive-strand DI RNA synthesis occurred from introduced negative-strand transcripts in the MHV-infected cells; this demonstration, using MHV, of DI RNA replication from transfected negative-strand DI RNA transcripts is the first such demonstration among all positive-stranded RNA viruses.","Joo, M; Banerjee, S; Makino, S",Journal of virology,661,23

To continue monitoring drug resistance, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of influenza A(H3N2) and A(H1N1) viruses isolated globally in 2005-2006. The results obtained by pyrosequencing indicate that 96.4% (n=761) of A(H3N2) viruses circulating in the United States were adamantane resistant. Drug resistance has reached 100% among isolates from some Asian countries. Analysis of correlation between the appearance of drug resistance and the evolutionary pathway of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene suggests at least 2 separate introductions of resistance into circulating populations that gave rise to identifiable subclades. It also indicates that resistant A(H3N2) viruses may have emerged in Asia in late 2001. Among A(H1N1) viruses isolated worldwide, resistance reached 15.5% in 2005-2006; in the United States alone, it was 4.0%. Phylogenetic analysis of the HA and M genes indicates that the acquisition of resistance in A(H1N1) viruses can be linked to a specific genetic group and was not a result of reassortment between A(H3N2) and A(H1N1) viruses. The results of the study highlight the necessity of close monitoring of resistance to existing antivirals as wells as the need for new therapeutics.","Deyde, Varough M; Xu, Xiyan; Bright, Rick A; Shaw, Michael; Smith, Catherine B; Zhang, Ye; Shu, Yuelong; Gubareva, Larisa V; Cox, Nancy J; Klimov, Alexander I",The Journal of infectious diseases,661,24

To analyze the immunogenicity of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV), SARS-CoV, spike DNA vaccine and the immunoregulatory activity of interleukin-2 (IL-2), DNA vaccine plasmids pcDNA-S and pcDNA-IL-2 were constructed and inoculated into BALB/c mice with or without pcDNA-IL-2 by using three different immunization routes (the intramuscular route, electroporation, or the oral route with live attenuated Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium). The cellular and humoral immune responses were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, lymphocyte proliferation assays, enzyme-linked immunospot assays, and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analyses. The results showed that specific humoral and cellular immunities could be induced in mice by inoculating them with SARS-CoV spike DNA vaccine alone or by coinoculation with IL-2-expressing plasmids. In addition, the immune response levels in the coinoculation groups were significantly higher than those in groups receiving the spike DNA vaccine alone. The comparison between the three vaccination routes indicated that oral vaccination evoked a vigorous T-cell response and a weak response predominantly with subclass immunoglobulin G2a (IgG2a) antibody. However, intramuscular immunization evoked a vigorous antibody response and a weak T-cell response, and vaccination by electroporation evoked a vigorous response with a predominant subclass IgG1 antibody response and a moderate T-cell response. Our findings show that the spike DNA vaccine has good immunogenicity and can induce specific humoral and cellular immunities in BALB/c mice, while IL-2 plays an immunoadjuvant role and enhances the humoral and cellular immune responses. Different vaccination routes also evoke distinct immune responses.

Influenza A viruses are well adapted to cross species barriers and evade host immunity. Viruses that cause no clinical signs in wild aquatic birds may adapt in domestic poultry to become highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses which decimate poultry flocks. Viruses that cause asymptomatic infection in poultry (e.g. the recently emerged A/H7N9 virus) may cause severe zoonotic disease and pose a major pandemic threat. Pandemic influenza arises at unpredictable intervals from animal viruses and, in its global spread, outpaces current technologies for making vaccines against such novel viruses. Confronting the threat of influenza in humans and other animals is an excellent example of a task that requires a One Health approach. Changes in travel, trade in livestock and pets, changes in animal husbandry practices, wet markets and complex marketing chains all contribute to an increased risk of the emergence of novel influenza viruses with the ability to cross species barriers, leading to epizootics or pandemics. Coordinated surveillance at the animal- human interface for pandemic preparedness, risk assessment, risk reduction and prevention at source requires coordinated action among practitioners in human and animal health and the environmental sciences. Implementation of One Health in the field can be challenging because of divergent short-term objectives.

METHODS Mice were inoculated with virus intravitreally. Mouse eyes harvested at varying times after inoculation were evaluated for apoptotic and immunologic events by hematoxylin and eosin staining, immunohistochemical staining, in situ terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay, and electron microscopy. Isolated retinas were analyzed for infectious virus and for expression of apoptosis-associated genes. RESULTS The number of apoptotic events was significantly elevated in infected eyes from BALB/c and CD-1 mouse strains, reaching a maximum at days 6 through 10, and returning to normal levels at day 20. The majority of apoptotic cells were observed in the outer nuclear layer of the infected retina. In contrast, few apoptotic cells were observed in normal or mock-injected mouse eyes. Apoptotic events within the retina were associated with the presence of viral antigen, infiltration of CD8(+) T cells, and clearance of infectious virus. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis identified the upregulation of Fas ligand (FasL) and granzyme B mRNAs within the infected retinas. The development of apoptosis, regulative gene expression, and viral clearance were similar in both retinal degeneration-susceptible (BALB/c) and -resistant (CD-1) mice. CONCLUSIONS Retinal apoptosis was associated with retinal inflammation, a decrease in infectious virus, and upregulation of genes associated with CTL killing. These studies indicate that retinal apoptosis may be one of the host mechanisms that contribute to limiting this retinal infection.","Wang, Y; Detrick, B; Yu, Z X; Zhang, J; Chesky, L; Hooks, J J",Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,661,26

MHV-H2 replicated efficiently in hamster, mouse, primate kidney (Vero, Cos 1, Cos 7), and human adenocarcinoma (HRT) cell lines but failed to replicate in porcine testicular (ST), feline kidney (CRFK), and canine kidney (MDCK) cells. To understand the molecular basis for coronavirus cross-species transfer into human cell lines, the replication of MHV-H2 was studied in hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells which expressed high levels of the human homologue of the normal murine receptor, biliary glycoprotein (Bgp). MHV-H2 replicated efficiently in human HepG2 cells, at low levels in breast carcinoma (MCF7) cells, and poorly, if at all, in human colon adenocarcinoma (LS 174T) cell lines which expressed high levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). These data suggested that MHV-H2 may utilize the human Bgp homologue as a receptor for entry into HepG2 cells. To further study MHV-H2 receptor utilization in human cell lines, blockade experiments were performed with a panel of different monoclonal or polyclonal antiserum directed against the human CEA genes. Pretreatment of HepG2 cells with a polyclonal antiserum directed against all CEA family members, or with a monoclonal antibody, Kat4c (cd66abde), directed against Bgp1, CGM6, CGM1a, NCA and CEA, significantly reduced virus replication and the capacity of MHV-H2 to infect HepG2 cells. Using another panel of monoclonals with more restricted cross reactivities among the human CEA's, Col-4 and Col-14, but not B6.2 B1.13, Col-1, Col-6 and Col-12 blocked MHV-H2 infection in HepG2 cells. These antibodies did not block sindbis virus (SB) replication in HepG2 cells, or block SB, MHV-A59 or MHV-H2 replication in DBT cells. Monoclonal antibodies Col-4, Col-14, and Kat4c (cd66abde) all reacted strongly with human Bgp and CEA, but displayed variable binding patterns with other CEA genes. Following expression of human Bgp in normally nonpermissive porcine testicular (ST) and feline kidney (CRFK) cells, the cells became susceptible to MHV-H2 infection. These data suggested that phylogenetic homologues of virus receptors represent natural conduits for virus xenotropism and cross-species transfer.","Hensley, L E; Baric, R S",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,661,22

OBJECTIVE To assess the incidence of coinfection in patients confirmed to have SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection, and thus, to determine the risk of ruling out SARS by ruling in another diagnosis. METHODS The present report is a retrospective study evaluating the incidence and impact of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV and other pulmonary pathogens in 117 patients. These patients were evaluated in a Toronto, Ontario, community hospital identified as the epicentre for the second SARS outbreak. RESULTS Coinfection with other pulmonary pathogens occurred in patients with SARS. Seventy-three per cent of the patient population evaluated had laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV infection. Serology showing acute or recent Chlamydophila pneumoniae or Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection revealed an incidence of 30% and 9%, respectively, in those with SARS. These rates are similar to previously published studies on coinfection in pneumonia. All nucleic acid diagnostic assays were negative for C pneumoniae and M pneumoniae in respiratory samples from patients with SARS having serological evidence for these atypical pathogens. CONCLUSIONS Diagnostic assays for well-recognized pulmonary pathogens have limitations, and ruling out SARS-CoV by ruling in another pulmonary pathogen carries significant risk. Despite positive serology for atypical pathogens, in a setting where clinical suspicion for SARS is high, specific tests for SARS should be performed to confirm or exclude a diagnosis.","Zahariadis, George; Gooley, Ted A; Ryall, Phyllis; Hutchinson, Christine; Latchford, Mary I; Fearon, Margaret A; Jamieson, Frances B; Richardson, Susan; Kuschak, Theodore; Mederski, Barbara",Canadian respiratory journal,661,24

PEMS is an acute, transmissible, infectious intestinal disease accompanied by high mortality and morbidity. The etiology of this multifactorial disease remains to be elucidated; however, turkey coronavirus was initially assumed to be one of the primary agents involved. Further investigation demonstrated that turkey coronavirus was not always detectable in poults exhibiting PEMS symptoms, and, thus, PEMS poults began to be identified as positive or negative for turkey coronavirus. In each trial, uninfected hatchmate controls were compared with turkey poults that were contact exposed to PEMS poults at 7 days of age. Following intravenous inoculation, control poults cleared Escherichia coli from their circulation by 60 min, whereas viable E. coli were still present in the circulation of PEMS poults at 60 min postinoculation. Inflammatory response measured by Sephadex-elicited abdominal exudate cell recruitment and the adherence potential of abdominal exudate cells was not significantly different between uninfected and PEMS poults. The percentage of glass-adherent abdominal exudate macrophages was higher in PEMS poults. However, the ability of these macrophages to phagocytize sheep red blood cells and the average number of sheep red blood cells per phagocytic macrophage were both lower compared with uninfected controls. CD4+ expression in thymic tissue of PEMS poults at 9 days postinfection was significantly lower. The CD4+:CD8+ lymphocyte ratio in peripheral blood leukocytes from coronavirus-negative PEMS poults was lower than that from both uninfected and coronavirus-positive PEMS poults at 14 days postinfection. In the spleen, the CD4+:CD8+ lymphocyte ratio was higher in coronavirus-positive PEMS poults as compared with the other treatments. In conclusion, immune system dysfunction in PEMS is associated with impaired mononuclear phagocytic system function and alterations in lymphocyte populations.","Heggen, C L; Qureshi, M A; Edens, F W; Barnes, H J; Havenstein, G B",Avian diseases,661,1

Numerous epidemiological studies have noted an association between the levels of air pollution and hospital admissions for a variety of different health reasons, including a number of respiratory diseases, as well as increased morbidity and mortality associated with various respiratory conditions and diseases. Because of the large impact respiratory virus infections have on morbidity and even mortality, it is important to understand whether and how exposure to common air pollutants could exacerbate the susceptibility to and severity of respiratory virus infections. This review focuses on current epidemiological and experimental studies, which have examined the association between and effect of air pollutants and respiratory viral infections, as well as potential mechanisms associated with these effects. Examined in this review are U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ""criteria"" pollutants nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), ozone (O(3)), and particulate matter (PM), as well as indoor pollutants such as environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) and combustion products of biomass fuels. Although a number of studies indicate associations between exposure to air pollutants and increased risk for respiratory virus infections, potential mechanisms mediating these effects are largely unexplored.

The N proteins were first used in a Western immunoblot assay to identify hMPV-negative sera, which were then used to determine the cutoff value of the ELISA test. Subsequent evaluation of the ELISA-N test revealed that the mean reciprocal antibody titer of 20 randomly selected seropositive children was 143, compared to 69 for 20 seropositive adults. In a prospective evaluation of 71 adults with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 58 (81.6%) had prior hMPV antibodies and 3 (4.2%) had evidence of recent hMPV infection. In testing paired sera from adults (n = 4) with recent hMPV group A infection confirmed by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), ELISAs using the N-A or N-B proteins were able to detect hMPV seroconversion. Moreover, testing of paired sera from three adults with a recent infection by the human respiratory syncytial virus confirmed by RT-PCR and serology did not reveal any increase in hMPV antibodies over time. The ELISA-N is a simple, objective, and specific serological test useful for detecting anti-hMPV antibodies following group A or B viral infections, which should permit a better understanding of the epidemiology of this virus.","Hamelin, Marie-Eve; Boivin, Guy",Clinical and diagnostic laboratory immunology,661,27

In days with a lower air temperature during the epidemic, the risk of increased daily incidence of SARS was 18.18-fold (95% confidence interval 5.6-58.8) higher than in days with a higher temperature. The total daily new cases might naturally decrease by an average of 2.8 patients for every 10 days during the epidemic. The multiplicative effect of infected hospital staff with patients in an intensive care unit (ICU) and the proportion of SARS patients in ICUs might respectively increase the risk of a larger SARS epidemic in the community. The provision of protective gear in hospitals was also a very important factor for the prevention of SARS infection. SARS transmission appeared to be dependent on seasonal temperature changes and the multiplicative effect of hospital infection.

The only disinfectants/sterilizers that did not caused degradation of the material-integrity were alcohol, electric cooker, ethylene oxide and peracetic acid fogging. Exposure to ultraviolet irradiation or microwave generated-steam resulted in a non-significant reduction in filter performance. CONCLUSION: There is a complex relationship between the FFR raw materials and the cycle conditions of the decontamination methods, evidencing the need for validating FFRs by models and manufacturers, as well as the process. Some methods may require additional tests to demonstrate the safety of FFRs for use due to toxicity.","Gnatta, Juliana Rizzo; de Souza, Rafael Queiroz; Lemos, Cassiane de Santana; Oliveira, Ramon Antônio; Martins, Lisiane Ruchinsque; Moriya, Giovana Abrahão de Araújo; Poveda, Vanessa de Brito",Am. j. infect. control,661,16

Objective: To evaluate the effect of somatotropin on skin wound healing in rats. Methods: Fifty-three male Wistar rats aged on average 145.19 days and weighing 287.27 g at the beginning of the study were divided into two groups: control (n=26) receiving 1.2 ml/day distilled water (SC), and experimental (n=27) receiving 0.2 IU/kg/day human somatotropin (SC). A skin wound was produced in the dorsum of the animal and measured daily, and wound contraction was calculated at the end of the experiment. At 3, 7 and 14 days, blood was collected from 9 animals in each group for biochemical determination of plasma proteins and the wound was resected for histological study. Epithelialization, local inflammatory reaction, granulation tissue, neovascularization and fibrosis were evaluated microscopically. Results: The calculation of wound contraction at the 3 checking times dis not show significant differences between the control and experimental groups. The biochemical determinations showed an decrease in total proteins (p=0.007) and a increase in the albumin/gobulin ratio (p=0.03) in the control group on the 14th day of the study, whereas remain stable in the experimental group. Histological evaluation showed a significant increase in fibrosis in the experimental group on the 7th day (p 0.0001). Conclusion: Somatotropin remain stable the albumin/globulin ratio and total plasma proteins on the 14th day, and also intensified cicatricial fibrosis when used for 7 days.","de Oliveira Marques dos Santos, Luciana; de Lourdes Pessole Biondo Simões, Maria; Paula Bächtold Machado, Ana; Roberto Matioski Filho, Gladyston; Cristina Endo, Patrícia; Rauen Gruen, Giselle; Rejane Cipriani, Vanessa; Deforville Mesquita, Lismary",Acta cir. bras.,661,16

To date no trial comparing hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV) has been performed. METHODS: Hospitalized patients &#8805;18 years old with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were treated with either HCQ or LPV/RTV if they had either respiratory insufficiency (SpO2â¯&#8804; 93% on room air or the need for oxygen insufflation) or bilateral consolidations on chest X­ray and at least 2 comorbidities associated with poor COVID-19 prognosis. Outcomes investigated included in-hospital mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, length of stay, PCR (polymerase chain reaction) negativity and side effects of treatment. RESULTS: Of 156 patients (41% female) with a median age of 72 years (IQR 55.25-81) admitted to our department, 67 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria (20 received HCQ, 47 LPV/RTV). Groups were comparable regarding most baseline characteristics. Median time from symptom onset to treatment initiation was 8 days and was similar between the groups (pâ¯= 0.727). There was no significant difference (HCQ vs. LPV/RTV) in hospital mortality (15% vs. 8.5%, pâ¯= 0.418), ICU admission rate (20% vs. 12.8%, pâ¯= 0.470) and length of stay (9 days vs. 11 days, pâ¯= 0.340). A PCR negativity from nasopharyngeal swabs was observed in approximately two thirds of patients in both groups. Side effects led to treatment discontinuation in 15% of patients in the LPV/RTV group. CONCLUSION: No statistically significant differences were observed in outcome parameters in patients treated with HCQ or LPV/RTV but patients in the LPV/RTV group showed a numerically lower hospital mortality rate. Additionally, in comparison to other studies we demonstrated a lower mortality in patients treated with LPV/RTV despite having similar patient groups, perhaps due to early initiation of treatment.","Karolyi, Mario; Pawelka, Erich; Mader, Theresa; Omid, Sara; Kelani, Hasan; Ely, Sarah; Jilma, Bernd; Baumgartner, Sebastian; Laferl, Hermann; Ott, Clemens; Traugott, Marianna; Turner, Michael; Seitz, Tamara; Wenisch, Christoph; Zoufaly, Alexander",Wien. klin.

We assessed the cell-type-specific expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and CTSL across 107 single-cell RNA-sequencing studies from different tissues. ACE2, TMPRSS2 and CTSL are coexpressed in specific subsets of respiratory epithelial cells in the nasal passages, airways and alveoli, and in cells from other organs associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission or pathology. We performed a meta-analysis of 31 lung single-cell RNA-sequencing studies with 1,320,896 cells from 377 nasal, airway and lung parenchyma samples from 228 individuals. This revealed cell-type-specific associations of age, sex and smoking with expression levels of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and CTSL. Expression of entry factors increased with age and in males, including in airway secretory cells and alveolar type 2 cells. Expression programs shared by ACE2+TMPRSS2+ cells in nasal, lung and gut tissues included genes that may mediate viral entry, key immune functions and epithelial-macrophage cross-talk, such as genes involved in the interleukin-6, interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor and complement pathways. Cell-type-specific expression patterns may contribute to the pathogenesis of COVID-19, and our work highlights putative molecular pathways for therapeutic intervention.","Muus, Christoph; Luecken, Malte D; Eraslan, Gökcen; Sikkema, Lisa; Waghray, Avinash; Heimberg, Graham; Kobayashi, Yoshihiko; Vaishnav, Eeshit Dhaval; Subramanian, Ayshwarya; Smillie, Christopher; Jagadeesh, Karthik A; Duong, Elizabeth Thu; Fiskin, Evgenij; Triglia, Elena Torlai; Ansari, Meshal; Cai, Peiwen; Lin, Brian; Buchanan, Justin; Chen, Sijia; Shu, Jian; Haber, Adam L; Chung, Hattie; Montoro, Daniel T; Adams, Taylor; Aliee, Hananeh; Allon, Samuel J; Andrusivova, Zaneta; Angelidis, Ilias; Ashenberg, Orr; Bassler, Kevin; Bécavin, Christophe; Benhar, Inbal; Bergenstråhle, Joseph; Bergenstråhle, Ludvig; Bolt, Liam; Braun, Emelie; Bui, Linh T; Callori, Steven; Chaffin, Mark; Chichelnitskiy, Evgeny; Chiou, Joshua; Conlon, Thomas M; Cuoco, Michael S; Cuomo, Anna S E; Deprez, Marie; Duclos, Grant; Fine, Denise; Fischer, David S; Ghazanfar, Shila; Gillich, Astrid",Nat Med,661,1

Two such candidate symptoms include anecdotally reported loss of smell and taste. Understanding the timing and association of smell/taste loss in COVID-19 may help facilitate screening and early isolation of cases. METHODS: A single-institution, cross-sectional study evaluating patient-reported symptoms with a focus on smell and taste was conducted using an internet-based platform on adult subjects who underwent testing for COVID-19. Logistic regression was employed to identify symptoms associated with COVID-19 positivity. RESULTS: A total of 1480 patients with influenza-like symptoms underwent COVID-19 testing between March 3, 2020, and March 29, 2020. Our study captured 59 of 102 (58%) COVID-19-positive patients and 203 of 1378 (15%) COVID-19-negative patients. Smell and taste loss were reported in 68% (40/59) and 71% (42/59) of COVID-19-positive subjects, respectively, compared to 16% (33/203) and 17% (35/203) of COVID-19-negative patients (p < 0.001). Smell and taste impairment were independently and strongly associated with COVID-19 positivity (anosmia: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 10.9; 95% CI, 5.08-23.5; ageusia: aOR 10.2; 95% CI, 4.74-22.1), whereas sore throat was associated with COVID-19 negativity (aOR 0.23; 95% CI, 0.11-0.50). Of patients who reported COVID-19-associated loss of smell, 74% (28/38) reported resolution of anosmia with clinical resolution of illness. CONCLUSION: In ambulatory individuals with influenza-like symptoms, chemosensory dysfunction was strongly associated with COVID-19 infection and should be considered when screening symptoms. Most will recover chemosensory function within weeks, paralleling resolution of other disease-related symptoms.","Yan, Carol H; Faraji, Farhoud; Prajapati, Divya P; Boone, Christine E; DeConde, Adam S",Int Forum Allergy Rhinol,661,1

Proper PPE and airway management techniques are critical to prevent the transmission of respiratory illnesses such as COVID-19. APPROACH: In March 2020, the authors implemented a structured train-the-trainers curriculum to teach PPE techniques and a modified airway management algorithm for suspected COVID-19 patients. A single emergency medicine physician trainer taught 17 subsequent emergency medicine and critical care physician trainers the proper PPE and airway management techniques. The initial trainer and 7 of the subsequent trainers then instructed 99 other emergency medicine resident and attending physicians using in situ simulation. Trainers and learners completed retrospective pre-post surveys to assess their comfort teaching the material and performing the techniques, respectively. OUTCOMES: The surveys demonstrated a significant increase in the trainers' comfort in teaching simulation-based education, from 4.00 to 4.53 on a 5-point Likert scale (P < .005), and in teaching the airway management techniques through simulation, from 2.47 to 4.47 (P < .001). There was no difference in the change in comfort level between those learners who were taught by the initial trainer and those who were taught by the subsequent trainers. These results suggest that the subsequent trainers were as effective in teaching the simulation material as the initial trainer. NEXT STEPS: Work is ongoing to investigate clinician- and patient-specific outcomes, including PPE adherence, appropriate AGP performance, complication rate, and learners' skill retention. Future work will focus on implementing similar train-the-trainers strategies for other health professions, specialties, and high-risk or rare procedures.","Peterson, William J; Munzer, Brendan W; Tucker, Ryan V; Losman, Eve D; Harvey, Carrie; Hatton, Colman; Sefa, Nana; Bassin, Ben S; Hsu, Cindy H",Acad. med,661,24

Studies have reported higher levels of depression, anxiety, insomnia, stress, distress, fear, burnout, and post-traumatic symptoms. OBJECTIVE: This research aimed to explore the psychological impacts of COVID 19 on paramedicine students. METHODS: A convergent mixed method design study was undertaken using self-reporting instruments and qualitative interviews. RESULTS: Responses were received from 151 students (38.3% responses rate). Most students experienced some level of anxiety (62%), although severe levels were only reported by 6% of respondents. Students had significantly greater odds (OR = 2.05, p = 0.045, 95% CI: 1.02, 4.12) of higher anxiety levels if they were female. Thematic analysis of the interviews largely supported these results, with themes focused on changing approaches to study, financial situation, social support, University adaptation, acceptance and career pathway choice. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified and explored the anxiety and coping strategies in an undergraduate paramedicine cohort when faced with a viral epidemic. Although most of the responding paramedic students reported above normal levels of anxiety in the initial stages of the COVID-19 outbreak, many students, with the help of learning, financial and social support, and a range of positive coping strategies, have adapted well to the impact of the pandemic and associated lockdown period.","King, Christine; Shannon, Brendan; Gosling, Cameron",Int Emerg Nurs,661,21

Our aim was to provide a detailed account of case characteristics, resource use, and outcomes of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in Germany, where the health-care system has not been overwhelmed by the pandemic. METHODS: In this observational study, adult patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, who were admitted to hospital in Germany between Feb 26 and April 19, 2020, and for whom a complete hospital course was available (ie, the patient was discharged or died in hospital) were included in the study cohort. Claims data from the German Local Health Care Funds were analysed. The data set included detailed information on patient characteristics, duration of hospital stay, type and duration of ventilation, and survival status. Patients with adjacent completed hospital stays were grouped into one case. Patients were grouped according to whether or not they had received any form of mechanical ventilation. To account for comorbidities, we used the Charlson comorbidity index. FINDINGS: Of 10â021 hospitalised patients being treated in 920 different hospitals, 1727 (17%) received mechanical ventilation (of whom 422 [24%] were aged 18-59 years, 382 [22%] were aged 60-69 years, 535 [31%] were aged 70-79 years, and 388 [23%] were aged &#8805;80 years). The median age was 72 years (IQR 57-82). Men and women were equally represented in the non-ventilated group, whereas twice as many men than women were in the ventilated group. The likelihood of being ventilated was 12% for women (580 of 4822) and 22% for men (1147 of 5199). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (5575 [56%] of 10â021), diabetes (2791 [28%]), cardiac arrhythmia (2699 [27%]), renal failure (2287 [23%]), heart failure (1963 [20%]), and chronic pulmonary disease (1358 [14%]). Dialysis was required in 599 (6%) of all patients and in 469 (27%) of 1727 ventilated patients. The Charlson comorbidity index was 0 for 3237 (39%) of 8294 patients without ventilation, but only 374 (22%) of 1727 ventilated patients. The mean duration of ventilation was 13·5 days (SD 12·1). In-hospital mortality was 22% overall (2229 of 10 021), with wide variation between patients without ventilation (1323 [16%] of 8294) and with ventilation (906 [53%] of 1727; 65 [45%] of 145 for non-invasive ventilation only, 70 [50%] of 141 for non-invasive ventilation failure, and 696 [53%] of 1318 for invasive mechanical ventilation). In-hospital mortality in ventilated patients requiring dialysis was 73% (342 of 469). In-hospital mortality for patients with ventilation by age ranged from 28% (117 of 422) in patients aged 18-59 years to 72% (280 of 388) in patients aged 80 years or older. INTERPRETATION: In the German health-care system, in which hospital capacities have not been overwhelmed by the COVID-19 pandemic, mortality has been high for patients receiving mechanical ventilation, particularly for patients aged 80 years or older and those requiring dialysis, and has been considerably lower for patients younger than 60 years.

However, social isolation measures have deeply changed their lifestyle, which is believed to have a psychological impact on them. The objective was to assess the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the emotional health of children and adolescents attending primary or secondary school. POPULATION AND METHODS: Parents of children and adolescents from San Carlos de Bariloche participated in the study. Adults' perception of the emotional and behavioral impact of lockdown on children and adolescents, changes in sleeping habits, screen use, sports-related activities, eating, and medical consultations, was assessed. RESULTS: A total of 267 parents were included. Of them, 96.3 % noticed emotional and behavioral changes. The most common ones were that their children were more bored (76.8 %), more irritable (59.2 %), more reluctant (56.9 %), and angrier (54.7 %). It was observed that they woke up and went to bed later, and slept 30 minutes more. Moreover, leisure screen use increased by 3 hours on weekdays. Time dedicated to physical activities did not change, but the type of activities did: swimming and team sports were replaced by biking, walking, and skiing. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 lockdown affected the emotional health and habits of children and adolescents. Boredom, irritability, and reluctance were more present during lockdown. The possibility of doing outdoor physical activities allowed them to keep practicing sports.","Schnaiderman, Diego; Bailac, Mariana; Borak, Laura; Comar, Haydeé; Eisner, Ana; Ferrari, Alejandra; Giannini, Gabriela; Risso, Fernando; Vetere, Carolina; Garibotti, Gilda",Arch Argent Pediatr,661,24

The aim of this trial was to investigate if a protocol for awake prone positioning reduces the rate of endotracheal intubation compared with standard care among patients with moderate to severe hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter randomized clinical trial. Adult patients with confirmed COVID-19, high-flow nasal oxygen or noninvasive ventilation for respiratory support and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio &#8804; 20 kPa were randomly assigned to a protocol targeting 16 h prone positioning per day or standard care. The primary endpoint was intubation within 30 days. Secondary endpoints included duration of awake prone positioning, 30-day mortality, ventilator-free days, hospital and intensive care unit length of stay, use of noninvasive ventilation, organ support and adverse events. The trial was terminated early due to futility. RESULTS: Of 141 patients assessed for eligibility, 75 were randomized of whom 39 were allocated to the control group and 36 to the prone group. Within 30 days after enrollment, 13 patients (33%) were intubated in the control group versus 12 patients (33%) in the prone group (HR 1.01 (95% CI 0.46-2.21), P = 0.99). Median prone duration was 3.4 h [IQR 1.8-8.4] in the control group compared with 9.0 h per day [IQR 4.4-10.6] in the prone group (P = 0.014). Nine patients (23%) in the control group had pressure sores compared with two patients (6%) in the prone group (difference - 18% (95% CI - 2 to - 33%); P = 0.032). There were no other differences in secondary outcomes between groups. CONCLUSIONS: The implemented protocol for awake prone positioning increased duration of prone positioning, but did not reduce the rate of intubation in patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 compared to standard care.

This study aimed to assess the efficacy of cognitive telerehabilitation in adolescents with learning disabilities to overcome the treatment problems related to the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. METHODS: Twenty-four patients diagnosed with Unspecified Learning Disability (mean ± SD age: 18.2 ± 2.9 years; 50% male) were enrolled in this study. The patients were assessed by a neuropsychological evaluation at the beginning and at the end of the program. All patients received cognitive treatment via a specific telehealth app to stimulate the cognitive skills related to learning. The treatment lasted four weeks, with a daily training (lasting up to 60 min), for five days a week. RESULTS: Our young patients reported a statistically significant improvement in the main cognitive domains that are usually compromised in learning disabilities, including sustained and selective attention, shifting of attention, control of interference, memory and speed of information processing. Moreover, the patients showed a good usability and motivation during the training. CONCLUSIONS: Our study has shown that telerehabilitation could be a valid tool for the rehabilitation of specific cognitive skills in adolescents with learning difficulties.","Maggio, Maria Grazia; Foti Cuzzola, Marilena; Calatozzo, Patrizia; Marchese, Domenicaroberta; Andaloro, Adriana; Calabrò, Rocco Salvatore",J Adolesc,661,21

The present study intends to clarify the effect of these restrictions on emergency medical service (EMS) operations. Materials and methods: Retrospective chart review of EMS operation protocols over the first 6 months of 2020 (nâ¯= 6668 rescue missions) in four rescue stations in eastern Lower Saxony (Germany). Description and statistical comparison of operations 6 weeks before the restrictions with an equally long period after the order of the restrictions (""lockdown""). Results: During the 6 weeks after the lockdown the frequency of rescue operations decreased by 17.7%. In particular, there was a 40.6% (nâ¯= 91) decrease of emergency cases with respiratory diseases, mainly due to a decline of pneumonia and exacerbated chronic-obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). At the same time, patients' mean age increased with fewer patients under 65 years. There were no changes in the frequency of psychiatric disorders, deceased or injured patients, or refusal of treatment and transport. A total of 67 patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV­2 infection (1.0%) were observed during this period. Discussion: EMS experienced a reduction of operations as a result of contact restrictions, although not as pronounced as was recently described for emergency rooms. This supports the hypothesis that the reduction is particularly evident in less severe cases and in younger patients. The reduction in pneumonia and COPD cases is striking. On the one hand, this could indicate that contact restrictions reduce the incidence of other respiratory infections and their impact on chronic respiratory disorders, but it could also mean that patients try to avoid hospital treatment.","Müller, Frank; Hummers, Eva; Jablonka, Alexandra; Schmidt, Tobias; Noack, Eva Maria",Notf Rett Med,661,24

The main objective of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of AT compared to Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. METHODS: StudyCov is a monocentric cross-sectional study. A SARS-CoV-2 screening facility was set up in the Bordeaux University health campus from October 28th to November 20th 2020. Students willing to have a RT-PCR test (ARGENE SARS-CoV-2 R-GENE, BioMérieux, France) for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis were also offered the Abbott Panbio&#8482; SARS-CoV-2 antigenic rapid test. All participants attending the screening facility with an AT in addition to RT-PCR and having signed an informed consent were included in the study. The main objective was to assess performance of AT as compared with RT-PCR in the recruited population. Secondary objectives dealt with the analysis of the main objective stratified by current symptoms and risk exposure. A sensitivity analysis with different RT-PCR cycle thresholds was included. RESULTS: RT-PCR and AT results were available for 692 subjects. Overall sensitivity and specificity of AT tests were respectively 63.5% (95% confidence interval (CI): 49.0 - 76.4) and 100% (95% CI: 99.4 - 100). In the asymptomatic sub-group, they were respectively 35.0% (95% CI: 15.4% - 59.2%) and 100% (95% CI: 99.3 - 100). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the poor sensitivity of AT in asymptomatic subjects, specificity being however excellent. The performance results fall below the World Health Organization recommendation of 80% sensitivity and question using AT in general population, especially when asymptomatic.","Ferté, Thomas; Ramel, Viviane; Cazanave, Charles; Lafon, Marie-Edith; Bébéar, Cécile; Malvy, Denis; Georges-Walryck, Agnès; Dehail, Patrick",J Clin Virol,661,16

Here, we aimed to investigate the phylogenetic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Chicago, Illinois, and assess their relationship to clinical parameters. METHODS: We performed whole-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 isolates collected from COVID-19 patients in Chicago in mid-March, 2020. Using these and other publicly available sequences, we performed phylogenetic, phylogeographic, and phylodynamic analyses. Patient data was assessed for correlations between demographic or clinical characteristics and virologic features. FINDINGS: The 88 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences in our study separated into three distinct phylogenetic clades. Clades 1 and 3 were most closely related to viral sequences from New York and Washington state, respectively, with relatively broad distributions across the US. Clade 2 was primarily found in the Chicago area with limited distribution elsewhere. At the time of diagnosis, patients infected with Clade 1 viruses had significantly higher average viral loads in their upper airways relative to patients infected with Clade 2 viruses, independent of disease severity. INTERPRETATION: These results show that multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2 were circulating in the Chicago area in mid-March 2020 that differed in their relative viral loads in patient upper airways. These data suggest that differences in virus genotype can impact viral load and may influence viral spread.

In this review, we discuss hypoxia's potential role in the pathogenesis of the maladaptive immune reaction against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The state of infection, with serious respiratory dysfunction, causes tissues to become hypoxic due to a discrepancy between cellular O2 uptake and consumption similar to that seen within tumor tissue during the progression of numerous solid cancers. In this context, the heterogeneous clinical behavior and the multiorgan deterioration of COVID-19 are discussed as a function of the upregulated expression of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) and of the metabolic reprogramming associated with HIF-1 and with a proinflammatory innate immune response activation, independent of the increase in the viral load of SARS-CoV-2. Possible pharmacological strategies targeting O2 aimed to improve prognosis are suggested.","Ferraro, Elisabetta; Germanò, Maria; Mollace, Rocco; Mollace, Vincenzo; Malara, Natalia",Oxid Med Cell Longev,661,1

During COVID-19, tweets with misinformation should be flagged and neutralized in their early stages to mitigate the damages. Most of the existing methods for early detection of fake news assume to have enough propagation information for large labeled tweets -- which may not be an ideal setting for cases like COVID-19 where both aspects are largely absent. In this work, we present ENDEMIC, a novel early detection model which leverages exogenous and endogenous signals related to tweets, while learning on limited labeled data. We first develop a novel dataset, called CTF for early COVID-19 Twitter fake news, with additional behavioral test sets to validate early detection. We build a heterogeneous graph with follower-followee, user-tweet, and tweet-retweet connections and train a graph embedding model to aggregate propagation information. Graph embeddings and contextual features constitute endogenous, while time-relative web-scraped information constitutes exogenous signals. ENDEMIC is trained in a semi-supervised fashion, overcoming the challenge of limited labeled data. We propose a co-attention mechanism to fuse signal representations optimally. Experimental results on ECTF, PolitiFact, and GossipCop show that ENDEMIC is highly reliable in detecting early fake tweets, outperforming nine state-of-the-art methods significantly.","Bansal, Rachit; Paka, William Scott; Nidhi,; Sengupta, Shubhashis; Chakraborty, Tanmoy",,661,13

DESIGN: Scoping review of peer-reviewed publications and manuscripts on preprint servers from January 2020 to 15 September 2020. PRIMARY MEASURE: Seroprevalence estimate (and lower and upper CIs). For studies conducted across a country or territory, we used the seroprevalence estimate and the upper and lower CIs and compared them to the total number of reported infections to calculate the ratio of reported to expected infections. RESULTS: We identified 23 population-based seroprevalence studies conducted in Europe. Among 12 general population studies, seroprevalence ranged from 0.42% among residual clinical samples in Greece to 13.6% in an area of high transmission in Gangelt, Germany. Of the eight studies in blood donors, seroprevalence ranged from 0.91% in North-Western Germany to 23.3% in a high-transmission area in Lombardy region, Italy. In three studies which recruited individuals through employment, seroprevalence ranged from 0.5% among factory workers in Frankfurt, Germany, to 10.2% among university employees in Milan, Italy. In comparison to nationally reported cases, the extent of infection, as derived from these seroprevalence estimates, is manyfold higher and largely heterogeneous. CONCLUSION: Exposure to the virus in Europe has not reached a level of infection that would prevent further circulation of the virus. Effective vaccine candidates are urgently required to deliver the level of immunity in the population.","Grant, Rebecca; Dub, Timothée; Andrianou, Xanthi; Nohynek, Hanna; Wilder-Smith, Annelies; Pezzotti, Patrizio; Fontanet, Arnaud",BMJ Open,661,16

This paper studies how this transparency policy affects the occupational outcomes and wages of male and female workers. Theoretically, pay transparency represents an information shock that alters the bargaining power of male and female employees vis-\`a-vis the firm in an asymmetric way. As women are currently underpaid, this shock may improve women's relative outcomes. We test these theoretical predictions using a difference-in-difference strategy that exploits the variation in the UK mandate across firm size and time. Our results show that pay transparency increases the probability that women are hired in above-median-wage occupations by 5 percent compared to the pre-policy mean. Additionally, it leads to a 2.8 percent decrease in male real hourly pay in treated firms compared to control ones. Combining the difference-in-difference strategy with a text analysis of job listings, we also find suggestive evidence that treated firms in industries with a high gender pay gap become more likely to post wage information than firms in the control group.","Duchini, Emma; Simion, Stefania; Turrell, Arthur",,661,24

The spike protein is the largest structural component of the virus and mediates interactions essential for infection, including with the primary ACE2 receptor. We performed two independent cell-based systematic screens to determine whether there are additional proteins by which the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 can interact with human cells. We discovered that in addition to ACE2, expression of LRRC15 also causes spike protein binding. This interaction is distinct from other known spike attachment mechanisms such as heparan sulfates or lectin receptors. Measurements of orthologous coronavirus spike proteins implied the interaction was restricted to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting LRRC15 represents a novel class of spike binding interaction. We localized the interaction to the C-terminus of the S1 domain, and showed that LRRC15 shares recognition of the ACE2 receptor binding domain. From analyzing proteomics and single-cell transcriptomics, we identify LRRC15 expression as being common in human lung vasculature cells and fibroblasts. Although infection assays demonstrated that LRRC15 alone is not sufficient to permit viral entry, we present evidence it can modulate infection of human cells. This unexpected interaction merits further investigation to determine how SARS-CoV-2 exploits host LRRC15 and whether it could account for any of the distinctive features of COVID-19. In briefWe present evidence from genome-wide screening that the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 interacts with human cells expressing LRRC15. The interaction is distinct from previously known classes of spike attachment factors, and appears to have emerged recently within the coronavirus family. Although not sufficient for cell invasion, this interaction can modulate viral infection. Our data point to an unappreciated host factor for SARS-CoV-2, with potential relevance to COVID-19. Highlights- Two systematic cell-based screens for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding identify LRRC15 as a human host factor - Interaction with LRRC15 is reproducible in different human cell lines and independent of known glycan or ACE2 binding pathways - The C-terminal S1 domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike binds LRRC15 with sub-micromolar affinity, while related coronavirus spikes do not - LRRC15 is expressed in tissues with high ACE2 levels and may modulate infection","Shilts, Jarrod; Crozier, Thomas M.; Teixeira-Silva, Ana; Gabaev, Ildar; Greenwood, Edward J.D.; Watson, Samuel James; Ortmann, Brian M.; Gawden-Bone, Christian M.; Pauzaite, Tekle; Hoffmann, Markus; Nathan, James A.; Pöhlmann, Stefan; Lehner, Paul J.; Wright, Gavin J.",,661,24

Models were evaluated in terms of precision, recall, F1-score (within 95% confidence interval). The early fusion model is the most effective predictor with 84% overall F1-score [CI 82.1–86.1]. The predictive performance of the model drops by 6 % when using recent clinical data while omitting the long-term medical history. Feature importance analysis indicates that history of cardiovascular disease, emergency room visits in the past year prior to testing, and demographic factors are predictive of the disease trajectory. We conclude that fusion modeling using medical history and current treatment data can forecast the need for hospitalization for patients infected with COVID-19 at the time of the RT-PCR test.","Tariq, A.; Celi, L.

Since disease detection based on manual checking of blood cells is time-consuming and full of errors, testing of blood cells using object detectors with Deep Convolutional Neural Network can be regarded as a feasible solution. In this work, an object detector based on YOLOF has been proposed to detect blood cell objects such as red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. This object detector is called TE-YOLOF, Tiny and Efficient YOLOF, and it is a One-Stage detector using dilated encoder to extract information from single-level feature maps. For increasing efficiency and flexibility, the EfficientNet Convolutional Neural Network is utilized as the backbone for the proposed object detector. Furthermore, the Depthwise Separable Convolution is applied to enhance the performance and minimize the parameters of the network. In addition, the Mish activation function is employed to increase the precision. Extensive experiments on the BCCD dataset prove the effectiveness of the proposed model, which is more efficient than other existing studies for blood cell detection.","Xu, Fanxin; Li, Xiangkui; Yang, Hang; Wang, Yali; Xiang, Wei",,661,5

The authors conducted a survey among health care workers (HCWs) and non-HCW populations in Khon Kaen, Thailand. RESULTS: A total of 805 participants participated. The prevalence of hand eczema in the study population was 20.87%. There were several risk factors, including working as a HCW, having a history of previous hand eczema, having underlying atopic dermatitis, wearing gloves in everyday life, and washing hands frequently (more than 10 times/day). Hand hygiene with alcohol-based products was shown to be a risk factor for hand eczema, (OR (95% CI) 1.86 (1.03-3.35), P = .04). CONCLUSION: In terms of hand eczema prevention, we suggest that the use of alcohol-based products should be discontinued if other handwashing methods are available. The following factors increase the risk of hand eczema: being a HCW, having previous hand eczema, and having underlying atopic dermatitis. Proper strategies in terms of hand eczema prevention should be addressed, especially in this group, since we need to continue performing hand hygiene during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Techasatian, Leelawadee; Thaowandee, Wilairat; Chaiyarit, Jitjira; Uppala, Rattapon; Sitthikarnkha, Phanthila; Paibool, Watuhatai; Charoenwat, Busara; Wongmast, Piyathida; Laoaroon, Napat; Suphakunpinyo, Chanyut; Kiatchoosakun, Pakaphan; Kosalaraksa, Pope",J Prim Care Community Health,661,10

Loneliness (hardly ever/some of the time/often) was assessed by the question ""In the past 30 days, how often did you feel alone/lonely?"". Social disconnectedness included information on social contacts through virtual talking (i.e. telephone, Skype, WhatsApp, or social media) and outside-home meetings with people living in another household. Covariates included sociodemographic and health related characteristics. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) with their 95% confidence interval (CI).Results: The overall prevalence of loneliness during the pandemic was 23.9% (95% CI 20.7-27.5); lower than in the pre-pandemic period (32.8%; 95% CI 28.6-37.4). In the pandemic period, 20.1% (95% CI 16.9-23.6) reported some of the time feeling lonely and 3.9% (95% CI 3.1-4.8) reported often feeling lonely. In the fully adjusted model, virtual talking disconnectedness (OR=1.67; 95% CI 1.09-2.56) was positively associated with some of the time feeling lonely and outside-home disconnectedness (OR=0.33; 95% CI 0.18-0.60) was negatively associated with often feeling lonely.Conclusion: Individuals with virtual talking disconnectedness and without outside-home disconnectedness are at higher risk of loneliness during the time of COVID-19 pandemic. Stimulating virtual talking connectedness might have the potential to diminish loneliness despite steep outside-home disconnectedness.","Torres, Juliana Lustosa; Braga, Luciana de Souza; Moreira, Bruno de Souza; Sabino Castro, Camila Menezes; Vaz, Camila Teixeira; Andrade, Amanda Cristina de Souza; Bof Andrade, Fabíola; Lima-Costa, Maria Fernanda; Caiaffa, Waleska Teixeira",Aging Ment Health,661,5

The effects of SAH orders on the trauma population remains unknown. We hypothesized an increase in rates of penetrating trauma, gunshot wounds, suicide attempts, and domestic violence in the Southern California trauma population after the SAH order. METHODS: A multicenter retrospective analysis of all trauma patients presenting to 11 American College of Surgeons (ACS) Level I and II trauma centers spanning seven counties in California was performed. Demographic data, injury characteristics, clinical data, and outcomes were collected. Patients were divided into three groups based on injury date: before SAH from 1/1/2020-3/18/2020 (PRE), after SAH from 3/19/2020-6/30/2020 (POST), and a historical control from 3/19/2019-6/30/2019 (CONTROL). POST was compared to both PRE and CONTROL in two separate analyses. RESULTS: Across all time periods, 20,448 trauma patients were identified (CONTROL: 7,707, PRE: 6,022, POST: 6,719). POST had a significantly increased rate of penetrating trauma (13.0% vs. 10.3%, p<0.001 and 13.0% vs. 9.9%, p<0.001) and gunshot wounds (4.5% vs. 2.4%, p=0.002 and 4.5% vs. 3.7%, p=0.025) compared to PRE and CONTROL, respectively. POST had a suicide attempt rate of 1.9% and a domestic violence rate of 0.7%, which were similar to PRE (p=0.478, p=0.514) and CONTROL (p=0.160, p=0.618). CONCLUSIONS: This multicenter Southern California study demonstrated an increased rate of penetrating trauma and gunshot wounds after the COVID-19 SAH orders, but no difference in attempted suicide or domestic violence rates. These findings may provide useful information regarding resource utilization and a target for societal intervention during the current or future pandemic(s).

This study aimed to examine impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on change of influenza vaccination acceptance and identify factors associated with acceptance of potential COVID-19 vaccination. METHOD: A cross-sectional self-administered anonymous questionnaire survey was conducted among nurses in Hong Kong, China during 26 February and 31 March 2020. Their previous acceptance of influenza vaccination and intentions to accept influenza and COVID-19 vaccination were collected. Their relationship with work-related and other factors were examined using multiple multinomial logistic regressions. RESULTS: Responses from 806 participants were retrieved. More nurses changed from vaccination refusal to hesitancy or acceptance than those changed from acceptance to vaccination hesitancy or refusal (15.5% vs 6.8% among all participants, P < 0.001). 40.0% participants intended to accept COVID-19 vaccination, and those in private sector (OR: 1.67, 95%CI: 1.11-2.51), with chronic conditions (OR: 1.83, 95%CI: 1.22-2.77), encountering with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients (OR: 1.63, 95%CI: 1.14-2.33), accepted influenza vaccination in 2019 (OR: 2.03, 95%CI: 1.47-2.81) had higher intentions to accept it. Reasons for refusal and hesitation for COVID-19 vaccination included ""suspicion on efficacy, effectiveness and safety"", ""believing it unnecessary"", and ""no time to take it"". CONCLUSION: With a low level of COVID-19 acceptance intentions and high proportion of hesitation in both influenza and COVID-19 vaccination, evidence-based planning are needed to improve the uptake of both vaccinations in advance of their implementation. Future studies are needed to explore reasons of change of influenza vaccination acceptance, look for actual behaviour patterns of COVID-19 vaccination acceptance and examine effectiveness of promotion strategies.","Wang, Kailu; Wong, Eliza Lai Yi; Ho, Kin Fai; Cheung, Annie Wai Ling; Chan, Emily Ying Yang; Yeoh, Eng Kiong; Wong, Samuel Yeung Shan",Vaccine,661,26

This disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in significant mortality especially among the older age population and those with health co-morbidities. In contrast, children are relatively spared of this potentially ravaging disease that culminates in the acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure and death. SARS-CoV-2 infection induces exuberant release of pro-inflammatory mediators, causing a ""cytokine storm"" and hypercoagulable states that underlie these complications. The SARS-CoV-2 infection median incubation is 5.1 days, with most developing symptoms by 11.5 days. It is highly infectious, spreading via the horizontal mode of transmission, but there is yet very limited evidence of vertical transmission to the newborn infant occurring either transplacentally or through breastfeeding. This said, various immune factors during childhood may modulate the expression of COVID-19, with the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) at the severe end of the disease spectrum.

The current study was conducted to explore drugs against Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 using in silico pharmacophore modelling and virtual screening approach to combat COVID-19. Methods: All the available sequences of RBD in NCBI were retrieved and multiple aligned to get insight into its diversity. The 3D structure of RBD was modelled and the conserved region was used as a template to design pharmacophore using LigandScout. Lead compounds were screened using Cambridge, Drugbank, ZINC and TIMBLE databases and these identified lead compounds were screened for their toxicity and Lipinski's rule of five. Molecular docking of shortlisted lead compounds was performed using AutoDock Vina and interacting residues were visualized. Results: Active residues of Receptor Binding Motif (RBM) in S, involved in interaction with receptor, were found to be conserved in all 483 sequences. Using this RBM motif as a pharmacophore a total of 1327 lead compounds were predicted initially from all databases, however, only eight molecules fit the criteria for safe oral drugs. Conclusion: The RBM region of S interacts with Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and Glucose Regulated Protein 78 (GRP78) to mediate viral entry. Based on in silico analysis, the lead compounds scrutinized herewith interact with S, hence, can prevent its internalization in cell using ACE2 and GRP78 receptor.The compounds predicted in this study are based on rigorous computational analysis and the evaluation of predicted lead compounds can be promising in experimental studies.","Shehroz, Muhammad; Zaheer, Tahreem; Hussain, Tanveer",Heliyon,661,1

We find that the lockdown policy caused a large and immediate surge in price and price dispersion of Chinese cabbage, though they fluctuated smoothly for the same period in normal years. The DID results further show that the price surge peaked in the fourth week of lockdown but gradually came down to the level of a normal year by week 11. However, the price rose again (though to a much smaller extent) in response to the resurgence of COVID-19 in a few provinces in early-mid April but quickly returned to the normal level in week 15 when the lockdown measures were largely removed.

It was observed that the mean scores of the participants' nutritional habits before the pandemic were lower than their mean scores during the pandemic period and a statistically significant difference was determined (p &lt;0.05). In addition, before the pandemic, it was seen that the physical activity score averages of the participants were higher than the physical activity score averages during the pandemic period, and statistically significance was determined (p&lt;0.05). As a result, it was observed that the eating habits of the physical education and sports teachers participating in the study were negatively affected during the pandemic period, and their physical activity levels decreased.

The focus is on the government’s (mis-)management of its non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) (or “lockdown”) to stem the pandemic and the organized business sector’s resistance against the lockdown.Design/methodology/approachThis paper makes use of a literature review and provides descriptive statistics and quantitative analysis of COVID-19 and the lockdown stringency in South Africa, based on data from Google Mobility Trends, Oxford University’s Stringency Index, Johns Hopkins University’s COVID-19 tracker and Our World in Data.FindingsThis paper finds that both the government and the business sector’s responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have been problematic. These key actors have been failing to “pull together,” leaving South Africa’s citizens in-between corrupt and incompetent officials on the one hand, and lockdown skeptics on the other. This paper argues that to break through this impasse, the country should change direction by agreeing on a smart or “Goldilocks” lockdown, based on data, testing, decentralization, demographics and appropriate economic support measures, including export support. Such a Goldilocks lockdown is argued, based on available evidence from the emerging scientific literature, to be able to save lives, improve trust in government, limit economic damages and moreover improve the country’s long-term recovery prospects.Research limitations/implicationsThe pandemic is an unprecedented crisis and moreover was still unfolding at the time of writing. This has two implications. First, precise data on the economic impact and certain epidemiological parameters was not (yet) available. Second, the causes of the mismanagement by the government are not clear yet, within such a short time frame. More research and better data may be able in future to allow conclusions to be drawn whether the problems that were besetting the country’s management of COVID-19 are unique or perhaps part of a more general problem across developing countries.Practical implicationsThe paper provides clear practical implications for both government and organized business. The South African Government should not altogether end its lockdown measures, but follow a smart and flexible lockdown. The organized business sector should abandon its calls for ending the lockdown while the country is still among the most affected countries in the world, and no vaccine is available.Social implicationsThere should be better collaboration between government, business and civil society to manage a smart lockdown. Government should re-establish lost trust because of the mismanagement of the lockdown during the first six months of the pandemic.Originality/valueThe outline of the smart lockdown that is proposed for the country combines NPIs with the promotion of exports, as a policy intervention to help aggregate demand to recover. The paper provides advice on how to resolve an impasse created by mismanagement of COVID-19, which could be valuable for decision-making during a crisis, particularly in developing countries.","Naudé, Wim Cameron Martin","Transforming Government: People, Process and Policy",661,1

Among them was the fear of a mechanical ventilator shortage due to COVID-19's high contagion rate and pathophysiology. Fears of a ventilator shortage unleashed a wave of innovations. MATERIAL AND METHOD: This manuscript describes the AmboVent, a ventilator, rapidly developed with a sense of urgency, by a group of Israeli volunteers. RESULTS: Using a decentralized approach, we worked extensively and managed within ten days to create a working ventilator. It utilizes a 64-year-old technological concept, the bag valve mask (BVM), sometimes known by the proprietary name Ambu bag, which we transformed into an automatic, controlled, and feature-rich ventilator by endowing it with contemporary computing technology. CONCLUSIONS: Applying a functional rather than a commercial-oriented approach can result in the ad hoc development of lifesaving solutions during a rapidly spreading pandemic.","Meiry, Gideon; Alkaher, David; Mintz, Yoav; Eran, Yuval; Kohn, Aryeh; Kornblau, Giora; Shneorson, Zeev; Alkaher, Shlomo; Sonkin, Roman; Jaffe, Eli",Minim Invasive Ther Allied Technol,661,1

Material and methods: The cancer patients who died of covid-19 during the analysis period have been reviewed describing the oncological and the covid-19 infection characteristics and the treatments established. Results: Confirmed cases covid-19: 1069 with 132 deaths (12.3%). With cancer 36 patients (3.4%), 15 deceased (41.6%). Of the deceased, only 6 patients (40%) were in active treatment. The most frequent associated tumor was lung (8/15 patients, 53.3%), 11 with metastatic disease (11/15, 73.3%). No specific treatment was established in 40 % (6/15) of the patients. The rest of them received treatments with the active protocols. Conclusion: Covid-19 mortality in cancer patients is almost four times higher than that of the general population. Until we have effective treatments or an effective vaccine, the only possibility to protect our patients is to prevent the infection with the appropriate measures.","Lara Álvarez, Miguel Ángel; Rogado Revuelta, Jacobo; Obispo Portero, Berta; Pangua Méndez, Cristina; Serrano Montero, Gloria; López Alfonso, Ana",,661,24

Key features of this disorder include a lack of bleeding risk, only mildly low platelet counts, elevated plasma fibrinogen levels, and detection of both severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and complement components in regions of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). This disorder is not typical DIC. Rather, it might be more similar to complement-mediated TMA syndromes, which are well known to rheumatologists who care for patients with severe systemic lupus erythematosus or catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome. This perspective has critical implications for treatment. Anticoagulation and antiviral agents are standard treatments for DIC but are gravely insufficient for any of the TMA disorders that involve disorders of complement. Mediators of TMA syndromes overlap with those released in cytokine storm, suggesting close connections between ineffective immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, severe pneumonia and life-threatening microangiopathy.","Merrill, Joan T; Erkan, Doruk; Winakur, Jerald; James, Judith A",Nat Rev Rheumatol,661,16

Zimbabwe has a rich plant biodiversity with only a limited number reported for the treatment of cancer. The leaf extracts of Dolichos kilimandscharicus were selected for the screening of their antiproliferative efficacy and cytotoxicity effects. This plant has increasingly been used by local folk as a treatment for cancer or cancer-related symptoms though its bioactivity has not been scientifically determined. This investigation also sought to identify constituent compounds in the crude extract preparations responsible for their antiproliferative efficacy. The antiproliferative effects of six-leaf extracts on Jurkat-T in vitro were investigated using the Trypan blue exclusion assay. The extracts were tested with increasing concentration, using chlorambucil as a standard anticancer drug. Cytotoxicity of extracts was determined against RAW 264.7 cells using a colorimetric tetrazolium-based assay. In additionthe ability of the extracts to induce apoptosis was determined for the most potent leaf extracts. The order of potency of the leaf extracts of D. kilimandscharicus against Jurkat-T cell line was found to be MeOH < Ethyl Acetate < DCM: MeOH < EtOH with IC50s of 33.56, 30.44, 22.93, and 21.59 µg/mL, respectively. Furthermore, the most potent extracts exhibited very low cytotoxicity against all the tested cells. D. kilimandscharicus leaf extracts induced apoptosis in the Jurkat-T cells as was shown by DNA fragmentation. UPLC-MS analysis of crude extracts led to the identification of 23 compounds from the ethanol extract and these may be responsible for the observed antiproliferative effects. Rutin, quercetin, luteolin, apigenin, hispidulin, kaempferol derivatives, as well as caffeoylquinic acid are some of the compounds identified in the extracts. The results of this study showed that the ethanol and ethyl acetate leaf extracts of D. kilimandscharicus have antiproliferative activity against Jurkat-T cells and may act by inducing apoptosis.. The current findings offer supporting evidence for the use of these plant species in the treatment of cancer in ethnomedicinal practices.","Sithole, Simbarashe; Mushonga, Paul; Nhamo, Llewellyn N R; Fru Chi, Godloves; Mukanganyama, Stanley",Biomed Res Int,661,16

Recently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention endorsed decontamination strategies to prolong the lifespan of single use respirators. Battelle and Duke University have validated hospital protocols to decontaminate respirators using vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) at 30%-35% concentrations. To prolong our supply of respirators, we evaluated and implemented VHP decontamination at 59% hydrogen peroxide concentration while detailing the effects of this process on the filtration efficiency and quantitative fit of single-use respirators. This study may help other health systems develop local solutions to their N95 mask shortage during this COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: N95 respirators (3M 8211 FF and 9210 FF) that were treated with 5 and 10 cycles of VHP by the V-PRO maX Low Temperature Sterilization System were evaluated quantitatively for filtration efficiency as well as with quantitative fit testing per Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards. A decontamination protocol was concurrently implemented at our institution. This process involved depositing used masks, reprocessing, and re-distributing treated masks efficiently back to frontline providers. Furthermore, we implemented patient safety officers on COVID-19/person under investigation units to ensure optimized donning/doffing of respirators through frontline provider education. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant changes in mean filtration efficiency between the control and VHP-treated respirators. Furthermore, both treated and untreated respirators demonstrated fit factors above the minimum pass requirement. CONCLUSIONS: We have successfully demonstrated that N95 respirator decontamination with VHP at 59% hydrogen peroxide can be safely utilized to decontaminate single-use N95 respirators without significant effects on filtration efficiency or quantitative fit testing. With the COVID-19 pandemic and N95 respirator shortage, health systems without access to commercial decontamination processes should investigate the viability of such a process in their facilities.","Jatta, Maimuna; Kiefer, Carolyn; Patolia, Harsh; Pan, Jin; Harb, Charbel; Marr, Linsey C; Baffoe-Bonnie, Anthony",Am. j. infect. control,661,24

Hand hygiene, social distancing, and the usage of personal protective equipment are considered the most vital tools in controlling the primary transmission of the virus. Converging evidence indicated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and its persistence over several days, which may create secondary transmission of the virus via waterborne and wastewater pathways. Although, researchers have started focusing on this mode of virus transmission, limited knowledge and societal unawareness of the transmission through wastewater may lead to significant increases in the number of positive cases. To emphasize the severe issue of virus transmission through wastewater and create societal awareness, we present a state of the art critical review on transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and the potential remedial strategies to effectively control the viral spread and safeguard society. For low-income countries with high population densities, it is suggested to identify the virus in large scale municipal wastewater plants before following up with one-to-one testing for effective control of the secondary transmission. Ultrafiltration is an effective method for wastewater treatment and usually more than 4 logs of virus removal are achieved while safeguarding good protein permeability. Decentralized wastewater treatment facilities using solar-assisted disinfestation methods are most economical and can be effectively used in hospitals, isolation wards, and medical centers for reducing the risk of transmission from high local concentration sites, especially in tropical countries with abundant solar energy. Disinfection with chlorine, sodium hypochlorite, benzalkonium chloride, and peracetic acid have shown potential in terms of virucidal properties. Biological wastewater treatment using micro-algae will be highly effective in removal of virus and can be incorporated into membrane bio-reaction to achieve excellent virus removal rate. Though promising results have been shown by initial research for inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater using physical, chemical and biological based treatment methods, there is a pressing need for extensive investigation of COVID-19 specific disinfectants with appropriate concentrations, their environmental implications, and regular monitoring of transmission. Effective wastewater treatment methods with high virus removal capacity and low treatment costs should be selected to control the virus spread and safeguard society from this deadly virus.","Thakur, Amrit Kumar; Sathyamurthy, Ravishankar; Velraj, R; Lynch, I; Saidur, R; Pandey, A K; Sharshir, Swellam W; Kabeel, Abd Elnaby; Hwang, Jang-Yeon; GaneshKumar, P",J Environ Manage,661,16

METHODS: We conducted a phase 1, dose-escalation, open-label trial of a messenger RNA vaccine, mRNA-1273, which encodes the stabilized prefusion SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S-2P) in healthy adults. The trial was expanded to include 40 older adults, who were stratified according to age (56 to 70 years or &#8805;71 years). All the participants were assigned sequentially to receive two doses of either 25 µg or 100 µg of vaccine administered 28 days apart. RESULTS: Solicited adverse events were predominantly mild or moderate in severity and most frequently included fatigue, chills, headache, myalgia, and pain at the injection site. Such adverse events were dose-dependent and were more common after the second immunization. Binding-antibody responses increased rapidly after the first immunization. By day 57, among the participants who received the 25-µg dose, the anti-S-2P geometric mean titer (GMT) was 323,945 among those between the ages of 56 and 70 years and 1,128,391 among those who were 71 years of age or older; among the participants who received the 100-µg dose, the GMT in the two age subgroups was 1,183,066 and 3,638,522, respectively. After the second immunization, serum neutralizing activity was detected in all the participants by multiple methods. Binding- and neutralizing-antibody responses appeared to be similar to those previously reported among vaccine recipients between the ages of 18 and 55 years and were above the median of a panel of controls who had donated convalescent serum. The vaccine elicited a strong CD4 cytokine response involving type 1 helper T cells. CONCLUSIONS: In this small study involving older adults, adverse events associated with the mRNA-1273 vaccine were mainly mild or moderate. The 100-µg dose induced higher binding- and neutralizing-antibody titers than the 25-µg dose, which supports the use of the 100-µg dose in a phase 3 vaccine trial.

Some of these non-resolved donations are occult HBV infections (OBIs), which pose potential risk of HBV transmission if they are not deferred. This study is aimed to further analyze these non-resolved donations. Methods: The non-resolved plasma samples were further analyzed by serological tests and various HBV DNA amplification assays including quantitative PCR (qPCR) and nested PCR amplifying the basic core and pre-core promoter regions (BCP/PC; 295 base pairs) and HBsAg (S) region (496 base pairs). Molecular characterizations of HBV DNA+ non-resolved samples were determined by sequencing analysis. Results: Of 17,226 MPs from 103,356 seronegative blood donations, 98 MPs were detected reactive for HBV. Fifty-six out of these 98 (57.1%) reactive MPs were resolved as HBV DNA+, but the remaining 42 pools (42.9%, 252 donations) were left non-resolved with a high rate (53.2%) of anti-HBc+. Surprisingly, among 42 non-resolved MPs, 17 contained one donation identified as OBIs by alternative NAT assays. Sequence analysis on HBV DNAs extracted from these OBI donations showed some key mutations in the S region that may lead to failure in HBsAg detection and vaccine escape. Conclusion: A total of 53.2% of the non-resolved donations were anti-HBc+, and OBIs were identified in 40.5% of these non-resolved pools. Therefore, non-resolved donations with anti-HBc+ might pose potential risk for HBV transmission. Our present analysis indicates that anti-HBc testing in non-resolved donations should be used to identify OBIs in order to further increase blood safety in China.","Ye, Xianlin; Zhao, Yu; Li, Ran; Li, Tong; Zheng, Xin; Xiong, Wen; Zeng, Jinfeng; Xu, Min; Chen, Limin",Front Immunol,661,15

In order to counter this epidemic, several countries put in place different restrictive measures, such as the school's closure and a total lockdown. However, as the knowledge on the disease progresses, clinical evidence showed that children mainly have asymptomatic or mild disease and it has been suggested that they are also less likely to spread the virus. Moreover, the lockdown and the school closure could have negative consequences on children, affecting their social life, their education and their mental health. As many countries have already entered or are planning a phase of gradual lifting of the containment measures of social distancing, it seems plausible that the re-opening of nursery schools and primary schools could be considered a policy to be implemented at an early stage of recovery efforts, putting in place measures to do it safely, such as the maintenance of social distance, the reorganisation of classes into smaller groups, the provision of adequate sanitization of spaces, furniture and toys, the prompt identification of cases in the school environment and their tracing. Therefore, policy makers have the task of balancing pros and cons of the school re-opening strategy, taking into account psychological, educational and social consequences for children and their families. Another issue to be considered is represented by socio-economic disparities and inequalities which could be amplified by school's closure.","Fantini, Maria Pia; Reno, Chiara; Biserni, Giovanni Battista; Savoia, Elena; Lanari, Marcello",Ital J Pediatr,661,1

The authors employ a set of difference-in-differences (DID) estimations to disentangle the lockdown effect on human mobility reductions from other confounding effects including panic effect, virus effect, and the Spring Festival effect. The authors find that the lockdown of Wuhan reduced inflow into Wuhan by 76.64%, outflows from Wuhan by 56.35%, and within-Wuhan movements by 54.15%. The authors also estimate the dynamic effects of up to 22 lagged population inflows from Wuhan and other Hubei cities, the epicenter of the 2019-nCoV outbreak, on the destination cities' new infection cases. The authors find, using simulations with these estimates, that the lockdown of the city of Wuhan on January 23, 2020 contributed significantly to reducing the total infection cases outside of Wuhan, even with the social distancing measures later imposed by other cities. The authors find that the COVID-19 cases would be 64.81% higher in the 347 Chinese cities outside Hubei province, and 52.64% higher in the 16 non-Wuhan cities inside Hubei, in the counterfactual world in which the city of Wuhan were not locked down from January 23, 2020. The authors also find that there were substantial undocumented infection cases in the early days of the 2019-nCoV outbreak in Wuhan and other cities of Hubei province, but over time, the gap between the officially reported cases and the estimated “actual” cases narrows significantly. The authors also find evidence that enhanced social distancing policies in the 63 Chinese cities outside Hubei province are effective in reducing the impact of population inflows from the epicenter cities in Hubei province on the spread of 2019-nCoV virus in the destination cities elsewhere.","Fang, Hanming Wang Long Yang Yang",,661,20

These vulnerable populations are often excluded from clinical trials resulting in one-size-fits-all treatment regimens based on those established for a non-pregnant adult population. Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) models can be used to optimize dose selection as they define the drug exposure-response relationship. Additionally, these models are able to identify patient characteristics which cause alterations in the expected PK/PD profiles and through simulations can recommend changes to dosing which compensate for the differences. In this review, we examine how PK/PD models have been applied to optimize antimalarial dosing recommendations for young children including those who are malnourished, pregnant women and individuals receiving concomitant therapies such as those for HIV treatment. The malaria field has had great success in utilizing PK/PD models as a foundation to update treatment guidelines and propose the next generation of dosing regimens to investigate in clinical trials. We propose how the malaria field can continue to use modeling to improve therapies by further integrating PK data into clinical studies and including data on drug resistance and host immunity in PK/PD models. Finally, we suggest that other disease areas can achieve similar success in applying pharmacometrics to improve outcomes by implementing three key principals.","Hughes, Emma; Wallender, Erika; Ali, Ali Mohamed; Jagannathan, Prasanna; Savic, Radojka M",Clin. pharmacol. ther,661,24

This study was conducted to clarify the patient's characteristics whose disease progressed to severe status. METHODS: The medical records of all consecutive 300 Japanese patients hospitalized at our institution between February and November 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. The clinical characteristics were evaluated to compare between mild (no oxygen needed), moderate (oxygen needs of 1-4 L/min), and severe diseases (oxygen needs of 5 L/min or more). RESULTS: The median age was 68 years old, with 123 (41.0%) males and 177 (59.0%) females. Of these, 199 patients (66.3%), 55 patients (18.3%), 46 patients (15.3%) patients were in the mild disease, moderate disease, severe disease groups, respectively. Patients with severe disease were more likely to be older, have more comorbidities, and tended to have higher body mass index. In laboratory data, lymphocyte count, levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), LDH, and AST on admission were significantly associated with the severity. In multivariate analysis, age and CRP were the independent risk factors for severe disease (OR = 1.050, 1.130, respectively). The optimal cut-off value for age was 74 years old and that for CRP was 3.15 mg/dL. CONCLUSIONS: Age and CRP were independently associated with disease severity of COVID-19 in multivariate analysis. Additionally, the numbers of underlying disease, lymphocyte count, and inflammatory markers such as LDH and D-dimer may also be related to disease severity.","Otoshi, Ryota; Hagiwara, Eri; Kitayama, Takaaki; Yamaya, Takafumi; Higa, Katsuyuki; Murohashi, Kota; Sato, Yozo; Tabata, Erina; Shintani, Ryota; Okabayashi, Hiroko; Ikeda, Satoshi; Niwa, Takashi; Nakazawa, Atsuhito; Oda, Tsuneyuki; Okuda, Ryo; Sekine, Akiamasa; Kitamura, Hideya; Baba, Tomohisa; Komatsu, Shigeru; Ogura, Takashi",J Infect Chemother,661,16

Since the suggestion that HCQ has potential for COVID-19, there have been varying responses from clinicians and healthcare institutions, ranging from adoption of protocols using HCQ for routine care to the conduct of randomised controlled trials to an effective system-wide prohibition on its use for COVID-19. In this article, we argue that the concept of 'disease public profile' has become a prominent, if not the sole, determinant in decision-making across various healthcare responses to the pandemic. In the case of COVID-19, the disease's public profile is based on clinical and non-clinical factors that include contagiousness, clinical presentation and media coverage. In particular, we briefly examine the dangers of a heightened public profile in magnifying the inequality of diseases and undermining three key ethical concepts, namely (1) evidence-based practice, (2) sustainable allocation and (3) meaningful consent.","Aquino, Yves S J; Cabrera, Nicolo",J Med Ethics,661,21

First, due to the recent trend of open journals, we were able to secure a certain amount of full-text XML of preprints and journal articles, and verified the technical feasibility of comparing preprints and journal articles. On the other hand, within the scope of this trial, in which we tried to clarify the difference between them based on external criteria such as the number of references and the number of words, and simple document similarity, we could not find a clear difference between preprints and journal articles, or between preprints that became journal articles and those that did not. Even with the machine learning method, the classification accuracy was not high at about 47%. The result that there is no significant difference between preprints and journal articles is a finding that has been shown in previous studies and has been replicated in larger and relatively recent situations. In addition to these, the new findings of this paper are that the differences in many external criteria, such as the number of authors, are small, and the differences with preprints that are not journal articles are not large.","Hitoshi, Koshiba; Kazuhiro, HayashiI",,661,24

And as for tech stocks, are they even less volatile than the market overall? In this paper, we provide evidence in favor of a ""quietness"" in the stock markets, interrupted by COVID-19, by analyzing dispersion, skewness and kurtosis characteristics of the empirical distribution of nine returns series that include individual FATANG stocks (FAANG: Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google; plus Tesla) and US indices (S&P 500, DJIA and NASDAQ). In comparison with the years before, the daily average return after COVID-19 was 6.48, 2.58 and 2.34 times higher for Tesla, Apple and NASDAQ, respectively. In terms of volatility, the increase was more pronounced in the three stock indices when compared to the individual FATANG stocks. This paper also puts forward a new methodology based on semi-variance and semi-kurtosis. While the value of the ratio between semi-kurtosis and kurtosis is always higher than 70% for the three US stock indices, in the case of stocks the opposite is true, which highlights the importance of large positive returns when compared to negative ones. Structural breaks and conditional heteroskedasticity are also analyzed by considering the traditional symmetrical and asymmetrical GARCH models. We show that in the most recent past, despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the FATANG tech stocks are characterized mostly by conditional homoskedasticity, while the returns of US stock indices are characterized mainly by conditional heteroskedasticity.","Curto, José Dias",Nonlinear Dyn,661,14

We investigate how this epidemic has influenced attention dynamics on the biggest Chinese microblogging website Sina Weibo in the period December 16, 2019 - April 17, 2020. We focus on the real-time Hot Search List (HSL), which provides the ranking of the most popular 50 hashtags based on the amount of Sina Weibo searches on them. We show, how the specific events, measures and developments during the epidemic affected the emergence of new hashtags and the ranking on the HSL. A significant increase of COVID-19 related hashtags started to occur on HSL around January 20, 2020, when the transmission of the disease between humans was announced. Then very rapidly a situation was reached, where the participation of the COVID-related hashtags occupied 30-70% of the HSL, however, with changing content. We give an analysis of how the hashtag topics changed during the investigated time span and conclude that there are three periods separated by February 12 and March 12. In period 1, we see strong topical correlations and clustering of hashtags; in period 2, the correlations are weakened, without clustering pattern; in period 3, we see potential of clustering while not as strong as in period 1. To quantify the dynamics of HSL we measured the lifetimes of hashtags on the list and the rank diversity at given ranks. Our observations indicate attention diversification since the COVID-19 outbreak in Mainland China and a higher rank diversity at the top 15 ranks on HSL due to the COVID-19 related hashtags, a drastic attention decay shortly after the outburst and a slower decay for a longer period.","Cui, Hao; Kert'esz, J'anos",,661,1

The present study was aimed to evaluate whether psoriatic DMSCs could affect adhesion and migration of ECs through neovascularization-related integrins in psoriasis. Human DMSCs, collected from psoriasis lesions and healthy skin respectively, were co-cultured with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The expression levels of three integrins, i.e., &#945;vß3, &#945;vß5 and &#945;5ß1 in HUVECs were tested by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blot. The adhesion and migration of HUVECs were detected by adhesion assay and migration assay. The results showed that in psoriasis group, the expression of &#945;Vß3 and &#945;5ß1 of HUVECs markedly increased 2.50-fold and 3.71-fold in mRNA levels, and significantly increased 1.63-fold and 1.92-fold in protein levels, comparing to healthy control group (all P<0.05). But ß5 was not significantly different between the two groups (P>0.05). In addition, compared with control, psoriatic DMSCs promoted HUVECs adhesion by 1.62-fold and migration by 2.91-fold (all P<0.05).

The repeated and frequent zoonotic outbreaks such as the most recent COVID-19 pandemic can be attributed also to human activities. In particular, the creation of enormous intensive domestic animal farms, the indiscriminate use of antibiotics, the destruction of forests, the consumption of the meat of wild animals and the illegal animal trade are all factors causing the insurgence and the transmission of zoonotic diseases from animals to humans. The purpose of this study was to explore the knowledge of the One Health concept including the zoonotic risk potentially derived from illegally traded pet animals and wildlife among adolescents in 6 different countries (Italy, Austria, Slovenia, Germany, Mauritius, and Japan). A representative sample of 656 students was recruited and all participants took an anonymous questionnaire. Data were analyzed by ANOVAs to estimate the prevalence of correct health prevention behaviors and to identify the influential factors for these behaviors. After two theoretical-practical lectures, the same anonymous questionnaire was administered for the second time in order to assess the efficacy of the program. The proportion of students who did not know that many diseases affecting humans come from animals is 28.96% while 32.16% of them did not know what a zoonosis is. The circularity of the One Health concept related to the transmission of diseases from animals to humans and vice-versa is not understood from a large prevalence of the adolescents with 31.40 and 59.91% of wrong responses, respectively. Furthermore, rabies is not considered as a dangerous disease by 23.02% of the adolescents. After two theoretical-practical classroom sessions, the correct answers improved to 21.92% according to the different question. More than a third of the student cohort investigated showed a profound ignorance of the zoonotic risks and a poor understanding of the One Health concept.

Insufficient sleep, a highly prevalent and frequently overlooked lifestyle pattern, impairs formation of immunological memory and T cell responses to viral infection, which may influence immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We hypothesized that objectively monitored, mild sleep restriction (SR) for 6 weeks reduces T cell cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 compared with baseline in healthy individuals. Methods: Ten healthy participants (50% women;40% African-American, 30% White and 30% other), age 42±17 y;BMI 26.8±5.3 kg/m2) with normal habitual sleep duration (7-8 h/night confirmed by 2-week actigraphy screening) underwent 6 weeks of mild SR (1.5 h less than their habitual sleep [HS]) prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Mean (±SD) sleep duration was 7 h 33 min ± 49 min during HS vs. 6 h ± 38 min during SR (p&lt;0.001). PBMC were cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen until stimulated with SARSCo-V-2 spike glycoprotein peptides (pool 1 = N-terminal and pooI 2 = C-Terminal) for 16 hours. Levels of SARSCoV-2 spike-specific CD4+ (OX40+CD137+) and CD8+ (CD69+CD137+) T cells were quantified by flow cytometry. Levels of cytokines released into supernatant after stimulation with spike peptide pools were quantified using human Th cytokine panel (12-plex) kit (Milipore Sigma). Results: Levels of SARS-CoV-2 spikespecific CD4+ T cells decreased after sleep restriction compared with baseline (pool 1: 0.12±0.02 vs. 0.30±0.08, p=0.04 and pool 2: 0.13±0.02 vs. 0.26±0.05, p=0.02). Similarly, SR reduced levels of SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific CD8+ T cells compared with baseline (pool 1: 0.08±0.01 vs. 0.17±0.04, p=0.07 and pool 2: 0.07±0.01 vs. 0.16±0.03, p=0.04). Levels of IL-13 and IL-22 decreased after SR compared with baseline (p=0.008 and 0.05, respectively). Conclusion: Insufficient sleep reduces T-cell cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 in healthy individuals. Impaired T-cell immunity in insufficient sleep may have implications for COVID-19 susceptibility and immunity as well as vaccine response.","Shah, R.; St-Onge, M.; Jelic, S.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,661,29

We have developed a novel aerosol barrier mask (ABM) to mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and other infectious pathogens. This Aerosol Barrier Mask is designed for preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission while transporting patients within hospital facilities. This mask can constrain aerosol and droplet particles and trap them in a biofilter, while the patient is normally breathing and administrated with medical oxygen. The system can be characterized as an oxygen delivery and mitigation mask which has no unfiltered exhaled air dispersion. The mask helps to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and potentially other infectious respiratory pathogens and protects everyone in general, especially healthcare professionals.","Abi Karam, Karam; Hota, Piyush; Mora, S Jimena; Lowell, Amelia; McKay, Kelly; Xian, Xiaojun; Patel, Bhavesh; Forzani, Erica",Respir Med,661,24

Other promising strategies include pegylation and development of antibody fragments, while carrier-encapsulated systems currently play no major role in pulmonary delivery of biologics for lung disease. While development of various biologics has been halted or has shown little effects, AIR DNase, alpha1-proteinase inhibitor, recombinant neuraminidase, and heparin are currently being evaluated in phase III trials.

The aim of the present study was to compare the characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) between hospitalized men and women with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. This multicenter, retrospective, observational study is based on the SEMI-COVID-19 Registry. We analyzed the differences between men and women for a wide variety of demographic, clinical, and treatment variables, and the sex distribution of the reported COVID-19 deaths, as well as intensive care unit (ICU) admission by age subgroups. This work analyzed 12,063 patients (56.8% men). The women in our study were older than the men, on average (67.9 vs. 65.7 years; p < 001). Bilateral condensation was more frequent among men than women (31.8% vs. 29.9%; p = 0.007). The men needed non-invasive and invasive mechanical ventilation more frequently (5.6% vs. 3.6%, p < 0.001, and 7.9% vs. 4.8%, p < 0.001, respectively). The most prevalent complication was acute respiratory distress syndrome, with severe cases in 19.9% of men (p < 0.001). In men, intensive care unit admission was more frequent (10% vs. 6.1%; p < 0.001) and the mortality rate was higher (23.1% vs. 18.9%; p < 0.001). Regarding mortality, the differences by gender were statistically significant in the age groups from 55 years to 89 years of age. A multivariate analysis showed that female sex was significantly and independently associated with a lower risk of mortality in our study. Male sex appears to be related to worse progress in COVID-19 patients and is an independent prognostic factor for mortality.

Climate change is likely contributing to stronger, wetter, slower-moving, and more dangerous hurricanes. Climate-driven hazards underscore the imperative for timely warning, evacuation, and sheltering of storm-threatened populations - proven life-saving protective measures that gather evacuees together inside durable, enclosed spaces when a hurricane approaches. Meanwhile, the rapid acquisition of scientific knowledge regarding how COVID-19 spreads has guided mass anti-contagion strategies, including lockdowns, sheltering at home, physical distancing, donning personal protective equipment, conscientious handwashing, and hygiene practices. These life-saving strategies, credited with preventing millions of COVID-19 cases, separate and move people apart. Enforcement coupled with fear of contracting COVID-19 have motivated high levels of adherence to these stringent regulations. How will populations react when warned to shelter from an oncoming Atlantic hurricane while COVID-19 is actively circulating in the community? Emergency managers, health care providers, and public health preparedness professionals must create viable solutions to confront these potential scenarios: elevated rates of hurricane-related injury and mortality among persons who refuse to evacuate due to fear of COVID-19, and the resurgence of COVID-19 cases among hurricane evacuees who shelter together.","Shultz, James M; Kossin, James P; Hertelendy, Attila; Burkle, Fredrick; Fugate, Craig; Sherman, Ronald; Bakalar, Johnna; Berg, Kim; Maggioni, Alessandra; Espinel, Zelde; Sands, Duane E; LaRocque, Regina C; Salas, Renee N; Galea, Sandro",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,661,10

We suggest that the field has been through three revolutions that have focussed on specific methodological developments; disease dynamics and heterogeneity, advanced computing and inference, and complexity and application to the real-world. Infectious disease dynamics and heterogeneity dominated until the 1980s where the use of analytical models illustrated fundamental concepts such as herd immunity. The second revolution embraced the integration of data with models and the increased use of computing. From the turn of the century an emergence of novel datasets enabled improved modelling of real-world complexity. The emergence of more complex data that reflect the real-world heterogeneities in transmission resulted in the development of improved inference methods such as particle filtering. Each of these three revolutions have always kept the understanding of infectious disease spread as its motivation but have been developed through the use of new techniques, tools and the availability of data. We conclude by providing a commentary on what the next revoluition in infectious disease modelling may be.","Baguelin, Marc; Medley, Graham F; Nightingale, Emily S; O039,; Reilly, Kathleen M; Rees, Eleanor M; Waterlow, Naomi R; Wagner, Moritz",Epidemics,661,2

The application of information and communication technology can be used as a driver for new innovative and more efficient processes supporting citizens in smart cities. An example is the optimization of everyday life processes like routine medical examinations of seniors during epidemic outbreaks like COVID-19. In this work we propose a novel standards-based IT system to enable evidence-based decision support for seniors, based on the integration of health and public transport data. The system supports seniors to take a safe path with the public transport in a smart city for their routine medical examinations during epidemic outbreaks like COVID-19. Furthermore, we describe the standardized integration of public transport data in the system as the first implementation step of the project. The requirements for the system were defined by a use case described through a sequence diagram, which was subsequently used to define the proposed system's IT architecture. As a first step of the prototype implementation, the integration of public transport data in the system was done using medical interoperability standards. Conformance tests were performed by applying the HL7 FHIR specification 3.0.1 through the official HL7 FHIR validator. The used standards could successfully be applied in the pilot. Semantic interoperability was supported through definition of code lists. The next steps of the prototype implementation include an update to HL7 FHIR 4.0.1 specification, the integration of the telemonitoring branch and the integration of the data from the Epidemiologic Reporting System based on HL7 FHIR. © 2020 ACM.","Urbauer, P.; Forjan, M.","9th International Conference on Software Development and Technologies for Enhancing Accessibility and Fighting Info-Exclusion, DSAI 2020",661,1

The benefit-risk balance for the use of lopinavir-ritonavir in COVID-19 needs to be monitored on an ongoing basis, therefore a systematic benefit-risk assessment was designed and conducted. A key objective of this study was to provide a platform for a dynamic systematic benefit-risk evaluation; although initially this evaluation is likely to contain limited information, it is required because of the urgent unmet public need. Importantly, it allows additional data to be incorporated as they become available, and re-evaluation of the benefit-risk profile. METHODS: A systematic benefit-risk assessment was conducted using the Benefit-Risk Action Team (BRAT) framework. The exposure of interest was lopinavir-ritonavir treatment in severe COVID-19 compared to standard of care, placebo or other treatments. A literature search was conducted in PubMed and Embase to identify peer-reviewed papers reporting clinical outcomes. Two clinicians constructed a value tree and ranked key benefits and risks in order of considered clinical importance. RESULTS: We screened 143 papers from PubMed and 264 papers from Embase for lopinavir-ritonavir; seven papers were included in the final benefit-risk assessment. In comparison to standard of care, data for several key benefits and risks were identified for lopinavir-ritonavir. Time to clinical improvement was not significantly different for lopinavir-ritonavir in comparison to standard of care (hazard ratio 1.31, 95% confidence interval 0.95-1.80). From one study, there were fewer cases of acute respiratory distress syndrome with lopinavir-ritonavir compared with standard of care (13% vs 27%). There also appeared to be fewer serious adverse events with lopinavir-ritonavir (20%) vs standard of care (32%). Limited data were available for comparison of lopinavir-ritonavir to other treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Based on currently available data, there was no clear benefit for the use of lopinavir-ritonavir compared to standard of care in severe COVID-19. Risk data suggested a possible decrease in serious adverse events. There was a reduction in acute respiratory distress syndrome with lopinavir-ritonavir in one study. Overall, the benefit-risk profile for lopinavir-ritonavir in severe COVID-19 cannot be considered positive until further efficacy and effectiveness data become available.","Osborne, Vicki; Davies, Miranda; Lane, Samantha; Evans, Alison; Denyer, Jacqueline; Dhanda, Sandeep; Roy, Debabrata; Shakir, Saad",Drug Saf,661,24

As remote consultations have been employed across specialities, there has been limited analysis of their efficacy. The goal of this study is to objectively assess if telephone medicine is valuable for clinical consultations in elective orthopaedics using a novel scoring tool. METHODS: A literature review and survey were performed to determine the objectives of a specialist consultation. Based on the results, a four-component scoring system was developed with a set of guidelines. Eighty telephone consultation letters from a hip and knee clinic were scored by two independent observers. The results were compared and the guidelines were clarified. Clinic letters from previous face to face consultations from the same clinic were scored and compared to telephone medicine letters. The inter-observer reliability was calculated using Cronbach's Alpha. RESULTS: The mean score of the telephone consultations was 7.3 as compared to 7.9 (Maximum possible score-8) with face to face consultations. Second opinion referrals scored the least when consulted over the telephone, while follow-up patients both pre-operative and post-operative scored similar to face to face consultations. The inter observer reliability co-efficient was more than 0.8 for every component of the score suggestive of good reliability. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies the areas where telephone medicine can make a valuable contribution to making diagnosis and treating orthopedic patients. We plan to use this to stratify future clinic appointments. The score is a simple, concise and reliable tool whose role may not be limited to orthopaedics but can be extended to other medical fields.","Virani, Siddharth; Eastwood, Selina; Holmes, Natalie; Shaeir, Mohammed; Housden, Philip",Surg.

As a consequence, economic activities within and across the countries were almost halted. As restrictions loosen and cities start to resume public and private transport to revamp the economy, it becomes critical to assess the commuters' travel-related risk in light of the ongoing pandemic. We develop a generalizable quantitative framework to evaluate the commute-related risk arising from inter-district and intra-district travels by combining Nonparametric Data Envelopment analysis for vulnerability assessment with transportation network analysis. We demonstrate the application of the proposed model for establishing travel corridors or travel bubbles within and across Gujarat and Maharashtra, two Indian states that have reported many SARS-CoV2 cases since early April 2020. Our findings suggest that establishing the travel bubble between a pair of districts solely based on the health vulnerability indices of origin-destination discards the en-route travel risks due to prevalent pandemic, hence underestimating the threat. For example, while the resultant of social and health vulnerabilities of Narmada and Vadodara's districts is relatively moderate, the en-route travel risk exacerbates the overall travel risk. Our study provides actionable insights to users into choosing the alternate path with the least risk and can inform political decisions to establish low-risk travel corridors within and across the states while accounting for social and health vulnerabilities in addition to transit-time related risks.","Dave, Raviraj; Choudhari, Tushar; Bhatia, Udit; Maji, Avijit",,661,24

We conducted a prospective, longitudinal analysis of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) donors at multiple time points over an 11-month period in order to determine how circulating antibody levels change over time following natural infection. METHODS: From April 2020 to February 2021, we enrolled 228 donors. At each study visit, subjects either donated plasma or had study samples drawn only. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 donor testing was performed using the VITROS® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total and IgG assays, and an in-house fluorescence reduction neutralization assay (FRNA). RESULTS: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were identified in 97% of COVID-19 convalescent donors at initial presentation. In follow up analyses, of the 116 donors presenting for repeat timepoints, 91.4% of donors had detectable IgG levels up to 11 months post-symptom recovery, while 63% had detectable neutralizing titers, however, we observed that 25% of donors had neutralizing levels that dropped to an undetectable titer over time. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that immunological memory is acquired in most individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 and is sustained in a majority of patients for up to 11 months after recovery.","De Giorgi, Valeria; West, Kamille A; Henning, Amanda N; Chen, Leonard N; Holbrook, Michael R; Gross, Robin; Liang, Janie; Postnikova, Elena; Trenbeath, Joni; Pogue, Sarah; Scinto, Tania; Alter, Harvey J; Cantilena, Cathy Conry",J. infect. dis,661,16
245474,245474,245474,What have we learned from the covid-19 pandemic so far?,18.315117,3.6478572,2020,"Gene expression analysis in individual neuronal types helps understand brain function. Genetic methods expressing fluorescent proteins are widely used to label specific neuronal populations. However, because cell type specificity of genetic labeling is often limited, it is advantageous to combine genetic labelling with additional methods to select specific cell/neuronal types. Laser capture microdissection is one of such techniques with which one can select a specific cell/neuronal population based on morphological observation. However, a major issue is disappearance of fluorescence signals during tissue processing required for high quality sample preparation. Here, we developed a simple, novel method in which fluorescence signals are preserved. We use genetic labeling with fluorescence proteins fused to transmembrane proteins, which shows highly stable fluorescence retention and allows for the selection of fluorescent neurons/cells based on morphology. Using this method in mice, we laser-captured neuronal somata and successfully isolated RNA. We determined that â¼100 cells are sufficient to obtain a sample required for downstream applications such as quantitative PCR. Capability to specifically micro-dissect targeted neurons was demonstrated by â¼10-fold increase in mRNA for fluorescent proteins in visually identified neurons expressing the fluorescent proteins compared to neighboring cells not expressing it. We applied this method to validate virus-mediated single-cell knockout, which showed up to 95% reduction in knocked-out gene RNA compared with wild-type neurons. This method using fluorescent proteins fused to transmembrane proteins provides a new, simple solution to perform gene expression analysis in sparsely labelled neuronal/cellular populations, which is especially advantageous when genetic labelling has limited specificity.Significance statementGenetic labeling of specific cell types with reporter fluorescent proteins is widely used for gene expression analysis. However, because the specificity of genetic labeling is often limited, an additional method is required to collect samples from a specific cell type. Here, we developed a novel method to allow for selection of a cell/neuronal type of interest based on morphology before performing sample collection using laser capture microdissection. Stable fluorescent signals from fluorescent proteins fused to transmembrane proteins allows us to morphologically select and laser-capture hundreds of single neurons. This method would be applicable to genomic and transcriptomic analysis of different cell/neuronal types and could facilitate our understanding of brain functions.","Chang, Ching Ching; Chong, Hai Tarng; Tashiro ç°ä»£æ­©, Ayumu",ENeuro,661,24

Providing continuous mental health services during the pandemics is a challenge worldwide, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This paper reports on the strategies and activities taken to protect public mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in Kosovo. This included establishing online and phone psychological first aid services and developing psychoeducational videos and webinars. The paper concludes with several lessons learned during the process of establishing and maintaining these interventions, such as: initial political endorsement is crucial to gain and maintain the momentum of services; continuous training of volunteers is crucial for both addressing the needs/problems, which arise during the process of work and maintain the motivation of volunteers; promotion of the services is crucial; academic curricula training mental health professionals should include digital mental health related courses and manualization on how to establish this kind of services in midst of crisis is crucial in order to ensure quick operationalization when needed again especially in LMIC settings. The interventions developed provide opportunity for further research especially by evaluating the impact of the services and exploring how online and provision of mental health and psychoeducation services online could help to cover services gap in times of isolation, limited movement and situations similar to pandemics in settings with limited mental health services and resources. The situation with pandemics with COVID 19 is still far from ending. Future waves of infections and restriction could again spike the mental health and psychosocial and psychological strain of the general population, therefore being prepared in provisions of psychological first aid and other mental health services online is crucial.","Arenliu, Aliriza; Uka, Fitim; Weine, Stevan",Psychiatr Danub,661,1

There is a global ambience of uncertainty and anxiety. In addition, nations have imposed strict and restrictive public health measures including lockdowns. In this heightened time of vulnerability, public cooperation to preventive measures depends on trust and confidence in the health system. Trust is the optimistic acceptance of the vulnerability in the belief that the health system has best intentions. On the other hand, confidence is assessed based on previous experiences with the health system. Trust and confidence in the health system motivate people to accept the public health interventions and cooperate with them. Building trust and confidence therefore becomes an ethical imperative. This article analyses the COVID-19 pandemic in the south Indian state of Tamil Nadu and the state's response to this pandemic. Further, it applies the Trust-Confidence-Cooperation framework of risk management to analyse the influence of public trust and confidence on the Tamil Nadu health system in the context of the preventive strategies adopted by the state.

METHODS: Geolocated tweets from U.S. counties (N = 115,330) were analyzed using MALLET LDA (Latent Dirichlet allocation) topic modeling techniques to correlate with prospective individual survey data (N = 3005) about vaccine attitudes, actual vaccination, and real-life discussions about vaccines with family and friends during the 2018-2019 influenza season. RESULTS: Ten topics were common across U.S. counties during the 2018-2019 influenza season. In the overall analyses, two of these topics (i.e., Vaccine Science Matters and Big Pharma) were associated with attitudes and behaviors. The topic concerning vaccine science in November-February was positively correlated with attitudes in February-March, r = 0.09, BF10 = 3. Moreover, among respondents who did not discuss the influenza vaccine with family and friends, the topic about vaccine fraud and children in November-February was negatively correlated with attitudes in February-March and with vaccination in February-March, and April-May (rs = -0.18 to -0.25, BF10 = 4-146). However, this was absent when participants had discussions about the influenza vaccine with family and friends. DISCUSSION: Regional vaccine content correlated with prospective measures of vaccine attitudes and actual vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Social media have demonstrated strong associations with vaccination patterns. When the associations are negative, discussions with family and friends appear to eliminate them. Programs to promote vaccination should encourage real-life conversations about vaccines.","Chan, Man-Pui Sally; Jamieson, Kathleen Hall; Albarracin, Dolores",Vaccine,661,6

This perspective paper aims to review the existing studies that support the practice of trauma-informed healthcare and to summarise best practices. Studies have shown that patients appreciate the questions that clinicians ask them about trauma-related issues and that they understand that this can be important for their healthcare. Furthermore, asking about trauma-related issues in a patient-centered and empathic way can result in better doctor-patient relationships, which improves the levels of satisfaction of both the patient and the doctor with the consultation, as well as improved health-related outcomes. As past traumatic experiences increase the risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder on exposure to a new TE, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to trauma-informed care becoming even more important if the strategy is to continue to invest in preventive medicine.","Tomaz, Teresa; Castro-Vale, Ivone",,661,1

Approximately 45-90% of affected individuals with DOA harbor pathogenic variants in the OPA1 gene. The mutation spectrum of OPA1 comprises nonsense, canonical and non-canonical splice site, frameshift and missense as well as copy number variants, but intragenic inversions have not been reported so far. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a 33-year-old male with characteristic clinical features of DOA. Whole-genome sequencing identified a structural variant of 2.4 kb comprising an inversion of 937 bp at the OPA1 locus. Fine mapping of the breakpoints to single nucleotide level revealed that the structural variation was an inversion flanked by two deletions. As this rearrangement inverts the entire first exon of OPA1, it was classified as likely pathogenic. CONCLUSIONS: We report the first DOA case harboring an inversion in the OPA1 gene. Our study demonstrates that copy-neutral genomic rearrangements have to be considered as a possible cause of disease in DOA cases.","Weisschuh, Nicole; Mazzola, Pascale; Heinrich, Tilman; Haack, Tobias; Wissinger, Bernd; Tonagel, Felix; Kelbsch, Carina",BMC Med Genet,661,26

Methods: Subjects with a previous diagnosis of DED. Their OSDI scores were compared with those recorded in Fall 2019 using the Wilcoxon paired test. Participants were stratified by face mask use: heavy (Group A) or standard (Group B) face mask users. Heavy use was defined as wearing any type of face mask for at least 6 hours a day, at least 5 days per week in the last 2 months. Results: 67 subjects (mean age: 45.27 ± 10.06 SD years, 40% males and 60% females). Median OSDI score in Fall 2019: 18.75. Median OSDI in Spring 2020: 20.83. The Hodges-Lehmann median difference was 2.09 (95% CI [1.05, 4.17]) (P < 0.0001). The population was then stratified into heavy and standard face mask users: Group A included heavy users (31 subjects; mean age: 42.81 ± 10.48 SD years; 35% males and 65% females), Group B included standard users (36 subjects; mean age: 47.39 ± 9.31 SD years; 44% males and 56% females). The Hodges-Lehmann median difference was 5.21 (95% CI [3.13, 7.29]) in Group A (P < 0.0001), and 1.04 (95% [0],[ 2.08]) in Group B (P = 0.0177). Conclusion: Prolonged and consistent face mask use is associated with an increase in OSDI scores.

To protect themselves, staff and providers were donning personal protective equipment to review paper records, which was time-consuming and wasteful. We describe an innovative process developed by a team of hospital leadership, members of a local collaborative of skilled nursing facilities, and leadership of this collaborative group, to address this problem. Many possible solutions were suggested and reviewed. We describe the reasons for selecting our final document transfer process and how it was implemented.

METHODS: We tested serum from patients with suspected immune-mediated neuropathies for antibodies directed against nodal/paranodal protein antigens using a live cell-based assay and solid-phase platform. The clinical and serological characteristics of antibody-positive and seronegative patients were then compared. Sera positive for pan-neurofascin were also tested against live myelinated human stem cell-derived sensory neurons for antibody binding. RESULTS: Eight patients with IgG1-subclass antibodies directed against both isoforms of the nodal/paranodal cell adhesion molecule neurofascin were identified. All developed rapidly progressive tetraplegia. Cranial nerve deficits (100% vs 26%), autonomic dysfunction (75% vs 13%) and respiratory involvement (88% vs 14%) were more common than in seronegative patients. Four patients died despite treatment with one or more modalities of standard immunotherapy (intravenous immunoglobulin, steroids and/or plasmapheresis), whereas the four patients who later went on to receive the B cell-depleting therapy rituximab then began to show progressive functional improvements within weeks, became seronegative and ultimately became functionally independent. CONCLUSIONS: IgG1 pan-neurofascin antibodies define a very severe autoimmune neuropathy. We urgently recommend trials of targeted immunotherapy for this serologically classified patient group.","Fehmi, Janev; Davies, Alexander J; Walters, Jon; Lavin, Timothy; Keh, Ryan; Rossor, Alexander M; Munteanu, Tudor; Delanty, Norman; Roberts, Rhys; Bäumer, Dirk; Lennox, Graham; Rinaldi, Simon",,661,1

This study aims to address this issue by proposing a spatial multicriteria approach to estimate the risk of the Brazilian health care system, by municipality, to exceed the health care capacity because of an influx of patients infected with the COVID-19. We estimated this risk for 5572 municipalities in Brazil using a combination of a multicriteria decision-making approach with spatial analysis to estimate the exceedance risk, and then, we examined the risk variation by designing 5 control intervention scenarios (3 scenarios representing reduction on social contacts, and 2 scenarios representing investment on health care system). For the baseline scenario using an average infection rate across Brazil, we estimated a mean Hospital Bed Capacity (HBC) value of -16.73, indicating that, on average, the Brazilian municipalities will have a deficit of approximately 17 beds. This deficit is projected to occur in 3338 municipalities with the north and northeast regions being at the greatest risk of exceeding health care capacity due to the COVID-19. The intervention scenarios indicate across all of Brazil that they could address the bed shortage, with an average of available beds between 23 and 32. However, when we consider the shortages at a municipal scale, bed exceedances still occur for at least 2119 municipalities in the most effective intervention scenario. Our findings are essential to identify priority areas, to compare populations, and to provide options for government agencies to act. This study can be used to provide support for the creation of effective health public policies for national, regional, and local intervention.","Requia, Weeberb J; Kondo, Edson Kenji; Adams, Matthew D; Gold, Diane R; Struchiner, Claudio José",Sci Total Environ,661,16

METHODOLOGY: We searched for official websites from the Ministries of Health and other official sources in all 22 Arab countries. Medline, Science Direct and Google Scholar websites were also used to search for COVID-19, 2019 novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus. The time period was from 1 January 2020 to 31 May 2020. RESULTS: As of May 31, 2020, COVID-19 has caused 290,428 confirmed cases, 3,696 deaths and 157,886 cured cases in all Arab countries. In terms of confirmed cases, Saudi Arabia followed by Qatar, UAE, Kuwait and Egypt have the highest reported cases. However, the total number of deaths was dominant in Egypt, followed by Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and UAE. In comparison to other non-Arab countries and confirmed cases, Arab countries come fourth after USA, Brazil and Russia. In terms of death, the Arab world is not listed as the top ten affected countries as only scored eight deaths per million have been recorded.

In the population, but also among health care workers (HCWs), there were concerns and skepticism about vaccinations even before the corona pandemic. METHODS: An online survey on the attitude of HCWs to vaccination against SARS-CoV­2 was carried out in December (December 3rd-December 12th, 2020) before and in February (February 1st-February 10th, 2021) after the start of the vaccinations. Members of the German Society for Internal Intensive Care Medicine and Emergency Medicine (DGIIN) and the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive Care Medicine and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) were invited by email and on Facebook. RESULTS: In December 2305 and in February 3501 people took part. The approval rate for vaccination increased from 85.2% to 92.1% (pâ¯< 0.001). There was also an increase in willingness to vaccinate (63.8% vs. 75.9%; pâ¯< 0.001). The female gender, membership of the professional group nursing staff and age < 45 years were significantly associated with a restricted willingness to vaccinate. There was also a decrease in concerns about efficacy, side effects and long-term damage. There was clear skepticism about the vaccine from AstraZeneca (Cambridge, United Kingdom). Before and after the introduction of vaccinations against SARS-CoV­2, an increase in the willingness to vaccinate against SARS-CoV-2 can be shown in German HCWs. Technical experts must bring objectivity into the currently controversial debate through precise and transparent information and thus counteract vaccination skepticism, not only among HCWs.","Janssens, Uwe; Kluge, Stefan; Marx, Gernot; Hermes, Carsten; Salzberger, Bernd; Karagiannidis, Christian",Med Klin Intensivmed Notfmed,661,16

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The microcirculatory parameters quantified included total vessel density (mm × mm-2), functional capillary density (mm × mm-2), proportion of perfused vessels (%), capillary hematocrit (%), the ratio of capillary hematocrit to systemic hematocrit, and capillary RBC velocity (µm × s-1). The number of leukocytes in capillary-postcapillary venule units per 4-second image sequence (4 s-1) and capillary RBC microaggregates (4 s-1) was measured. In comparison with healthy volunteers, the microcirculation of coronavirus disease 2019 patients showed increases in total vessel density (22.8 ± sd 5.1 vs 19.9 ± 3.3; p < 0.0001) and functional capillary density (22.2 ± 4.8 vs 18.8 ± 3.1; p < 0.002), proportion of perfused vessel (97.6 ± 2.1 vs 94.6 ± 6.5; p < 0.01), RBC velocity (362 ± 48 vs 306 ± 53; p < 0.0001), capillary hematocrit (5.3 ± 1.3 vs 4.7 ± 0.8; p < 0.01), and capillary-hematocrit-to-systemic-hematocrit ratio (0.18 ± 0.0 vs 0.11 ± 0.0; p < 0.0001). These effects were present in coronavirus disease 2019 patients with Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores less than 10 but not in patients with Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores greater than or equal to 10. The numbers of leukocytes (17.6 ± 6.7 vs 5.2 ± 2.3; p < 0.0001) and RBC microaggregates (0.90 ± 1.12 vs 0.06 ± 0.24; p < 0.0001) was higher in the microcirculation of the coronavirus disease 2019 patients. Receiver-operating-characteristics analysis of the microcirculatory parameters identified the number of microcirculatory leukocytes and the capillary-hematocrit-to-systemic-hematocrit ratio as the most sensitive parameters distinguishing coronavirus disease 2019 patients from healthy volunteers. CONCLUSIONS: The response of the microcirculation to coronavirus disease 2019-induced hypoxemia seems to be to increase its oxygen-extraction capacity by increasing RBC availability. Inflammation and hypercoagulation are apparent in the microcirculation by increased numbers of leukocytes and RBC microaggregates.","Favaron, Emanuele; Ince, Can; Hilty, Matthias P; Ergin, Bülent; van der Zee, Philip; Uz, Zühre; Wendel Garcia, Pedro D; Hofmaenner, Daniel A; Acevedo, Claudio T; van Boven, Wim Jan; Akin, Sakir; Gommers, Diederik; Endeman, Henrik",Crit Care Med,661,1

COVID-19 has caused by a new virus that had not been identified in human previously. This was followed by a widespread and rapid spread of this epidemic throughout the world. Daily, the number of the confirmed cases are increasing rapidly, number of the suspect increases, based on the symptoms that accompany this disease, and unfortunately number of the deaths also increase. Therefore, with these increases in number of cases around the world, it becomes hard to manage all these cases information with different situations; if the patient either injured or suspect with which symptoms that appeared on the patient. Therefore, there is a critical need to construct a multi-dimensional system to store and analyze the generated large-scale data. In this paper, a Comprehensive Storing System for COVID-19 data using Apache Spark (CSS-COVID) is proposed, to handle and manage the problem caused by increasing the number of COVID-19 daily. CSS-COVID helps in decreasing the processing time for querying and storing COVID-19 daily data. CSS-COVID consists of three stages, namely, inserting and indexing, storing, and querying stage. In the inserting stage, data is divided into subsets and then index each subset separately. The storing stage uses set of storing-nodes to store data, while querying stage is responsible for handling the querying processes. Using Apache Spark in CSS-COVID leverages the performance of dealing with large-scale data of the coronavirus disease injured whom increase daily. A set of experiments are applied, using real COVID-19 Datasets, to prove the efficiency of CSS-COVID in indexing large-scale data.","Elmeiligy, Manar A.; Desouky, Ali I.

Extensive discourse about disruptions to the standardized examinations students take in their final year of secondary school is symbolic of their high-stakes status worldwide. The interruptions provide an opportune moment to question the efficacy of exams as a measurement of achievement. To explore these issues, this article shares some on-the-ground illustrations from Australian teachers about how high-stakes exams shape their enactment of senior secondary history curriculum. The presence of a discourse of exam alignment, which places a disproportionate emphasis on preparing students for exams, has implications for teachers' curricular practices and wider equity issues. These issues resonate in other international settings, especially during the pandemic. The severity of the Covid-19 economic downturn means it is more important than ever to investigate the relationship between curricular practices and socio-economic structures, to ensure examinations do not compound educational disadvantage.","Cairns, Rebecca",Prospects (Paris),661,14

This study examines the individual mobility patterns for all transport modes (walk, bicycle, motorcycle, car driven alone, car driven in company, bus, subway, tram, train, airplane) before and during the restrictions adopted in ten countries on six continents: Australia, Brazil, China, Ghana, India, Iran, Italy, Norway, South Africa and the United States. This cross-country study also aims at understanding the predictors of protective behaviors related to the transport sector and COVID-19. Findings hinge upon an online survey conducted in May 2020 (N = 9,394). The empirical results quantify tremendous disruptions for both commuting and non-commuting travels, highlighting substantial reductions in the frequency of all types of trips and use of all modes. In terms of potential virus spread, airplanes and buses are perceived to be the riskiest transport modes, while avoidance of public transport is consistently found across the countries. According to the Protection Motivation Theory, the study sheds new light on the fact that two indicators, namely income inequality, expressed as Gini index, and the reported number of deaths due to COVID-19 per 100,000 inhabitants, aggravate respondents' perceptions. This research indicates that socio-economic inequality and morbidity are not only related to actual health risks, as well documented in the relevant literature, but also to the perceived risks.

In this case study, we describe the surge response required by our laboratory to meet the fluctuating demand for SARS-CoV-2 in our regional pathology service in Western Sydney, Australia between March and May 2020. While the overall number of SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive cases was relatively low compared to other Australian local health districts, testing numbers were highly unpredictable and changed on a weekly basis as local outbreaks were detected. As with other laboratories, numerous other challenges were also faced during this period, including the requirement to introduce a new and unaccredited diagnostic PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2, local and global shortages of reagents for sampling and sample processing, and a significant institutional SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in our laboratory catchment area. A successful service delivery during this period could only be maintained by a dynamic whole-of-laboratory and organizational response including (1) operational changes to the hours of service and the expansion of diagnostic testing at our laboratory site and other sites within our organization (2) careful management of specialist staff and re-training and recruitment of additional staff (3) changes to laboratory workflows to improve SARS-CoV-2 PCR test turnaround time and to accommodate limits to precious laboratory reagents; (4) clear communication within our laboratory and the NSW Health Pathology organization; and (5) collaborative co-ordination and support by NSW Health Pathology.","Sparks, Rebecca; Balgahom, Rifky; Janto, Catherine; Polkinghorne, Adam; Branley, James; Samarasekara, Harsha",Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis,661,30

METHOD: Prevalence study. The presence of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was determined in HCP of the HD. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) tests were used. Field work took place from April 24, 2020 to May 8, 2020. The age, sex, occupation (physician, nurse, etc.) and the work area (Primary Care, Emergency Room, etc.) were gathered. The IgG antibody prevalence was then calculated with its 95% confidence interval (95%CI). To study the association between HCP characteristics and the presence IgG the Chi Square test was used, and to study the magnitude of association, the Odds Ratio (95%CI) was calculated. RESULTS: Of the 4813 HCP in the HD, 4179 (87,1%) participated. Of these, 73,3% (3065) were women and 26,7% (1114) men. The global prevalence of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was 6,6% (95%CI: 5,8-7,3).

They have high risk of contracting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Objective: To assess the estimated clinical outcomes, costs, and cost-effectiveness associated with strategies for COVID-19 management among adults experiencing sheltered homelessness. Design, Setting, and Participants: This decision analytic model used a simulated cohort of 2258 adults residing in homeless shelters in Boston, Massachusetts. Cohort characteristics and costs were adapted from Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program. Disease progression, transmission, and outcomes data were taken from published literature and national databases. Surging, growing, and slowing epidemics (effective reproduction numbers [Re], 2.6, 1.3, and 0.9, respectively) were examined. Costs were from a health care sector perspective, and the time horizon was 4 months, from April to August 2020. Exposures: Daily symptom screening with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of individuals with positive symptom screening results, universal PCR testing every 2 weeks, hospital-based COVID-19 care, alternative care sites (ACSs) for mild or moderate COVID-19, and temporary housing were each compared with no intervention. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cumulative infections and hospital-days, costs to the health care sector (US dollars), and cost-effectiveness, as incremental cost per case of COVID-19 prevented. Results: The simulated population of 2258 sheltered homeless adults had a mean (SD) age of 42.6 (9.04) years. Compared with no intervention, daily symptom screening with ACSs for pending tests or confirmed COVID-19 and mild or moderate disease was associated with 37% fewer infections (1954 vs 1239) and 46% lower costs ($6.10 million vs $3.27 million) at an Re of 2.6, 75% fewer infections (538 vs 137) and 72% lower costs ($1.46 million vs $0.41 million) at an Re of 1.3, and 51% fewer infections (174 vs 85) and 51% lower costs ($0.54 million vs $0.26 million) at an Re of 0.9. Adding PCR testing every 2 weeks was associated with a further decrease in infections; incremental cost per case prevented was $1000 at an Re of 2.6, $27â¯000 at an Re of 1.3, and $71â¯000 at an Re of 0.9. Temporary housing with PCR every 2 weeks was most effective but substantially more expensive than other options. Compared with no intervention, temporary housing with PCR every 2 weeks was associated with 81% fewer infections (376) and 542% higher costs ($39.12 million) at an Re of 2.6, 82% fewer infections (95) and 2568% higher costs ($38.97 million) at an Re of 1.3, and 59% fewer infections (71) and 7114% higher costs ($38.94 million) at an Re of 0.9. Results were sensitive to cost and sensitivity of PCR and ACS efficacy in preventing transmission. Conclusions and Relevance: In this modeling study of simulated adults living in homeless shelters, daily symptom screening and ACSs were associated with fewer severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections and decreased costs compared with no intervention. In a modeled surging epidemic, adding universal PCR testing every 2 weeks was associated with further decrease in SARS-CoV-2 infections at modest incremental cost and should be considered during future surges.","Baggett, Travis P; Scott, Justine A; Le, Mylinh H; Shebl, Fatma M; Panella, Christopher; Losina, Elena; Flanagan, Clare; Gaeta, Jessie M; Neilan, Anne; Hyle, Emily P; Mohareb, Amir; Reddy, Krishna P; Siedner, Mark J; Harling, Guy; Weinstein, Milton C; Ciaranello, Andrea; Kazemian, Pooyan; Freedberg, Kenneth A",JAMA Netw Open,661,2

Higher needle insertion forces and deflection can increase tissue damage and decrease biopsy sample integrity. To overcome these drawbacks, we present a novel bioinspired approach to reduce insertion forces and minimize needle-tip deflection. It is well known from the literature, design of bioinspired surgical needles results in decreasing insertion forces and needle-tip deflection from the needle insertion path. This technical note studies the influence of vibration on bioinspired needle to further reduce insertion forces and needle-tip deflection. Bioinspired needle geometrical parameters such as barb shapes and geometries were analyzed to determine the best design parameters. Static and dynamic (vibration) needle insertion tests were performed to determine the maximum insertion forces and to estimate needle-tip deflection. Our results show that introducing vibration on the bioinspired needle insertion can reduce the maximum insertion force by up to 50%.

In China, all schools were shut down and students were home quarantined to prevent disease spread; these steps could have potential negative effects on mental health of adolescents. This study aimed to examine changes in depression and anxiety among Chinese adolescents during the COVID-19 epidemic, and explore factors associated with depression and anxiety. Two survey administrations were conducted among Chinese adolescents between February 20 and February 27 and between April 11 and April 19, 2020, respectively. The Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale were used to assess depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms, respectively. A total of 9554 and 3886 adolescents participated in the first and second surveys. During the initial survey, the prevalence of depression was 36.6% (95% CI: 35.6-37.6%) while the prevalence of anxiety was 19% (95% CI: 18.2-19.8%). Rates of depression and anxiety increased to 57.0% (95% CI: 55.4-58.6%) and 36.7% (95% CI: 35.2-38.2%), respectively, in the second survey. Multivariable logistic regression analyses revealed that group membership in the second survey, female gender, senior secondary school enrollment, and concerns about entering a higher grade were positively associated with both depression and anxiety. Conversely, a sleep duration of &#8805;6 h/day, an exercise duration &#8805;30 min/day, having the same as typical or higher study efficiency during the COVID-19 outbreak, and living in provinces with 1000-9999 confirmed COVID-19 cases were negatively associated with depression and anxiety. In conclusion, compared to figures reported during the COVID-19 outbreak, the prevalence of depression and anxiety in Chinese adolescents significantly increased after the initial outbreak. Regular screening and appropriate interventions are urgently needed to reduce the risk for emotional disturbances among adolescents during and after the initial COVID-19 outbreaks.","Chen, Xu; Qi, Han; Liu, Rui; Feng, Yuan; Li, Wen; Xiang, Mi; Cheung, Teris; Jackson, Todd; Wang, Gang; Xiang, Yu-Tao",Transl Psychiatry,661,23

While this pandemic rages, the opioid crisis worsens. During this period, the pandemic has resulted in the decimation of most conventional medical services, including those of chronic pain management, with the exception of virtual care and telehealth. Many chronic pain patients have been impacted in numerous ways, with increases in cardiovascular disease, mental health problems, cognitive dysfunction, and early death. The epidemic has also resulted in severe economic and physiological consequences for providers. Drug deaths in America, which fell for the first time in 25 years in 2018, rose to record numbers in 2019 and are continuing to climb, worsened by the coronavirus pandemic. The opioid epidemic was already resurfacing with a 5% increase in overall deaths from 2018; however, the preliminary data show that prescription opioid deaths continued to decline, while at the same time deaths due to fentanyl, methamphetamine, and cocaine climbed, with some reductions in heroin deaths. The health tracker data also showed that along with an almost 88% decline in elective surgeries, pain-related prescriptions declined 15.1%. Despite increases in telehealth, outpatient services declined and only began returning towards normal at an extremely slow pace, accompanied by reduced productivity and increased practice costs. This review, therefore, emphasizes the devastating consequences of concurrent epidemics on chronic pain management and the need to develop best practice efforts to preserve access to treatment for chronic pain.","Manchikanti, Laxmaiah; Vanaparthy, Rachana; Atluri, Sairam; Sachdeva, Harsh; Kaye, Alan D; Hirsch, Joshua A",Pain Ther,661,6

They are applied to study the spreading of infections, as in the case of CoviD-19, where the counting of the cumulated number $N(t)$ of detected infected individuals is a generally accepted, coarse-grain, variable to understand the epidemic phase. However $N(t)$ does not take into account the unknown number of asymptomatic, not detected, cases $A(t)$. Therefore, the question arises if the observed time series of data of $N(t)$ is a reliable tool for monitoring the evolution of the infectious disease. We study a system of coupled differential equations which includes the dynamics of the spreading among symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals and the strong containment effects due to the social isolation. The solution is therefore compared with a macroscopic law for the population $N(t)$ coming from a single, non-linear, differential equation with no explicit reference to $A(t)$, showing the equivalence of the two methods. Indeed, $N(t)$ takes into account a more complex and detailed population dynamics which permits the evaluation of the number of asymptomatic individuals also. The model is then applied to Covid-19 spreading in Italy where a transition from an exponential behavior to a Gompertz growth for $N(t)$ has been observed in more recent data. Then the information contained in the data analysis of $N(t)$ is reliable to understand the epidemic phase, although it does not describe the total infected population. The asymptomatic population is larger than the symptomatic one in the fast growth phase of the spreading.","D.Lanteri,; D.Carco',; P.Castorina,",,661,16

To determine the relationships among photosynthesis, ROS, and defence responses to powdery mildew in wheat, we compared the responses of the Pm40-expressing wheat line L658 and its susceptible sister line L958 at 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h post-inoculation (hpi) with powdery mildew via analyses of transcriptomes, cytology, antioxidant activities, photosynthesis, and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters. The results showed that H2O2 accumulation in L658 was significantly greater than that in L958 at 6 and 48 hpi, and the enzymes activity and transcripts expression of peroxidase and catalase were suppressed in L658 compared with L958. In addition, the inhibition of photosynthesis in L658 paralleled the global downregulation of photosynthesis-related genes. Furthermore, the expression of the salicylic acid-related genes non-expressor of pathogenesis related genes 1 (NPR1), pathogenesis-related 1 (PR1), and pathogenesis-related 5 (PR5) was upregulated, while the expression of jasmonic acid- and ethylene-related genes was inhibited in L658 compared with L958. In conclusion, the downregulation of photosynthesis-related genes likely led to a decline in photosynthesis, which may be combined with the inhibition of peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) to generate two stages of H2O2 accumulation. The high level of H2O2, salicylic acid and PR1 and PR5 in L658 possible initiated the hypersensitive response.","Hu, Yuting; Zhong, Shengfu; Zhang, Min; Liang, Yinping; Gong, Guoshu; Chang, Xiaoli; Tan, Feiquan; Yang, Huai; Qiu, Xiaoyan; Luo, Liya; Luo, Peigao",,661,4

It is responsible for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which has cost the lives of 2.5 million people. Ergo, the global scientific community has been scrambling to repurpose or develop therapeutics to treat COVID-19. Dietary supplements and nutraceuticals are among those under consideration due to the link between nutritional status and patient outcomes. Overall, poor vitamin D status seems to be associated with an increased risk of COVID-19. Severely ill COVID-19 patients appear to be deficient or have suboptimal levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, a measure of vitamin D status. Consequently, vitamin D is now the subject of several prophylactic and therapeutic clinical trials. In this review, the general status of nutraceuticals and dietary supplements amid the pandemic is appraised, with a particular focus on vitamin D. Consumers should be aware of misinformation and unsubstantiated promises for products marketed for COVID-19 protection. However, maintaining a healthy diet and lifestyle will likely maintain health including optimum immune function that may affect patient outcomes.

While several governments have imposed a nationwide total or partial lockdown to slow down the spread of the virus, the Swedish government has opted for a recommendation-based approach together with a few imposed restrictions. In a previous contribution by the authors, the impact of the Swedish strategy was observed through the monitored variation of the city noise levels during a period associated with the so-called ""first wave"" of the pandemic in Stockholm. A very strong impact of these recommendations was shown on the evolution of the noise levels in central Stockholm. This highlighted the potential of acoustic sensor networks both for enforcement of regulation and monitoring of the effectiveness of their implementation. The present contribution presents a follow-up to this urban noise monitoring in central Stockholm, Sweden, for the period leading to the so-called ""second wave"" of the pandemic in Europe. Both the evolution of adherence to the recommendations and the impact of the recurrence of cases combined with reinforced recommendations are observed through the evolution of the measured noise levels. While the measurements show a gradual lower level of compliance, in particular, past the summer break, these also show again a rapid response to the reinforced recommendations issued by the authorities in mid-fall of 2020. These observations thus confirm the potential associated with detailed urban noise monitoring, for instance here acting as a proxy to evaluating the response to recommendations or restrictions in times of crisis.","Rumpler, Romain; Venkataraman, Siddharth; Göransson, Peter",J Acoust Soc Am,661,21

Many studies have shown that several laboratory parameters are related to disease severity and mortality in SARS-CoV-2 cases. This meta-analysis aimed to determine the relationship of a prognostic factor, D-dimer, with disease severity, need for intensive care unit (ICU) care, and mortality in SARS-CoV-2 patients. METHODS: A systematic search for all observational studies and trials involving adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 that had any data related to D-dimer on admission was conducted using PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, ProQuest, and MedRxiv databases. We performed random-effects inverse-variance weighting analysis using mean difference (MD) of D-dimer values for outcomes such as disease severity, mortality, and need for ICU care. RESULTS: A total of 29 studies (4,328 patients) were included in this meta-analysis, which revealed a higher mean of D-dimer levels on admission in severe patients than in nonsevere patients (MD = 0.95, [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.61-1.28], P < .05; I2 = 90%). The nonsurvivor group had a higher pooled MD of D-dimer values on admission (MD = 5.54 [95% CI: 3.40-7.67], P < .05; I2 = 90%). Patients who needed ICU admission had insignificantly higher D-dimer values than patients who did not need ICU admission (MD = 0.29, [95% CI: -0.05 to 0.63], P = .10; I2 = 71%). CONCLUSION: Elevated D-dimer levels on admission were associated with an increased risk of disease severity and mortality in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Nugroho, Johanes; Wardhana, Ardyan; Maghfirah, Irma; Mulia, Eka Prasetya Budi; Rachmi, Dita Aulia; A039,; yun, Maya Qurota; Septianda, Imanita",Int. j. lab. hematol,661,15

Among all kinds of device structures, conventional n-i-p SSCs with top organic hole transport layers (HTLs) show great potential since organic HTLs could be well-designed to smoothly extract holes from the Se single absorber and protect the Se surface. However, till now, the performance of Se solar cells with organic HTLs is not as good as expected. To address this issue, herein, the SSCs are first presented with organic polymers as the HTLs with the improved efficiency up to 4.3%, which is the highest one in organic HTLs-based SSCs. Additionally, comparing with perovskite solar cells, it is found that the recombination process is the key factor that influences the performance of SSCs. It is believed that the further optimization of the Se active layer and the design of new and suitable organic HTLs for SSCs should be the main focus to suppress the undesired recombination processes of Se films. Such realization would boost the efficiency of the as-fabricated SSCs.","Liu, Wenbo; Yu, Fei; Fan, Weijun; Li, Wei-Shi; Zhang, Qichun",Small,661,21

A járvánnyal szembeni védekezés során mindennapossá vált a maszkhasználat, amely jelentos kihívást jelent a hétköznapi kommunikációs helyzetekben. Az egészségügy bizonyos területein korábban is jelen volt ez a probléma, azonban a most általános érvényu, folyamatos maszkviselés és védoruha-használat szimbolikus és gyakorlati értelemben is akadályként jelenik meg az orvos és a páciens között, ami több szinten nehezíti a hatékony kapcsolatteremtést és kommunikációt. Ezért szükségessé vált olyan egységes kommunikációs protokollok kidolgozása, amelyek segítik a bizalmi kapcsolat kiépítését az egészségügyben úgy, hogy az ellátók érzelmi elérhetosége és a biztonságos fizikai távolságtartás egyszerre valósuljon meg. Tanulmányunk célja, hogy a kurrens szakirodalom áttekintése révén összefoglaljuk a maszkviselés és a védoruha-használat hatásait az orvos-beteg kommunikációra és a kapcsolatban megjeleno bizalomra és empátiás folyamatokra, valamint fel kívánjuk hívni a figyelmet az egészségügyi személyzetet éro hatásokra is. Célunk továbbá, hogy a hazai és nemzetközi tapasztalatokat figyelembe véve olyan ajánlásokat fogalmazzunk meg, melyek segítségével javítható az egészségügyi dolgozók kommunikációja, azon keresztül pedig az ellátás legfontosabb szereploinek, a betegeknek és az ellátóknak az elégedettsége a kapcsolattal. Orv Hetil. 2021; 162(23): 897-904. Summary. In the fight against the epidemic, the use of masks has become commonplace, which is a significant challenge in everyday communication situations. This problem has been present in some areas of healthcare in the past, but today's universal use of masks and personal protective equipment (PPE) is both a symbolic and practical barrier between doctor and patient, making it difficult to establish an effective communication and connectivity on several levels. Therefore, it has become necessary to develop unified communication protocols that help building a relationship of trust in healthcare so that emotional availability of providers and safe physical distance are achieved simultaneously. The aim of our study is to summarize the effects of mask wearing and PPE usage on the physician-patient communication and also the trust and empathy processes that emerge within the relationship through the review of the current literature. We would also like to draw attention to the effects on healthcare staff. Our goal is also to formulate recommendations, taking into account domestic and international experience, that can be used to improve the communication of healthcare professionals, and through that, the satisfaction of the most important actors in care, patients and caregivers.

Although the emergently approved vaccine programs against SARS-CoV-2 have been rolled out globally, the number of COVID-19 daily cases and deaths has remained significantly high. Here, we attempt to computationally screen for possible medications for COVID-19viarapidly estimating the highly potential inhibitors from an FDA-approved drug database against the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2. The approach combined molecular docking and fast pulling of ligand (FPL) simulations that were demonstrated to be accurate and suitable for quick prediction of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors. The results suggested that twenty-seven compounds were capable of strongly associating with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Among them, the seven top leads are daclatasvir, teniposide, etoposide, levoleucovorin, naldemedine, cabozantinib, and irinotecan.

Since there is no specific therapy for this new coronavirus infection (COVID-19), searching for an effective and safe anti-inflammatory therapy is critical.Materials and methods This study evaluated efficacy and safety of pulse therapy with high doses of glucocorticosteroids (GCS), methylprednisolone 1,000 mg for 3 days plus dexamethasone 8 mg for another 3-5 days, in 17 patients with severe coronavirus pneumonia as a part of retrospective comparative analysis (17 patients in control group). The study primary endpoint was the aggregate dynamics of patients' condition as evaluated by an original CCS-COVID scale, which included, in addition to the clinical status, assessments of changes in the inflammation marker, C-reactive protein (CRP); the thrombus formation marker, D-dimer; and the extent of lung injury evaluated by computed tomography (CT). Patients had signs of lung injury (53.2â% and 25.6â%), increases in CRP 27 and 19 times, and a more than doubled level of D-dimer (to 1.41 µg/ml and 1.15 µg/ml) in the active therapy and the control groups, respectively. The GCS treatment group had a more severe condition at baseline.Results The GCS pulse therapy proved effective and significantly decreased the CCS-COVID scores. Median score difference was 5.00 compared to the control group (Ñ=0.011). Shortness of breath considerably decreased; oxygen saturation increased, and the NEWS-2 clinical status scale scores decreased. In the GCS group, concentration of CRP significantly decreased from 134âmg/dl to 41.8âmg/dl (Ñ=0.009) but at the same time, D-dimer level significantly increased from 1.41 µg/ml to 1.98 µg/ml (Ñ=0.044). In the control group, the changes were nonsignificant. The dynamics of lung injury by CT was better in the treatment group but the difference did not reach a statistical significance (Ñ=0.062). Following the GCS treatment, neutrophilia increased (Ñ=0.0001) with persisting lymphopenia, and the neutrophil/lymphocyte (N/L) ratio, a marker of chronic inflammation, increased 2.5 times (Ñ=0.006). The changes in the N/L ratio and D-dimer were found to correlate in the GCS pulse therapy group (r =0.49, p=0.04), which underlined the relationship of chronic autoimmune inflammation with thrombus formation in COVID-19. No significant changes were observed in the control group. In result, four patients developed venous thromboembolic complications (two of them had pulmonary artery thromboembolism) after the GCS pulse therapy despite the concomitant antiplatelet treatment at therapeutic doses. Recovery was slower in the hormone treatment group (median stay in the hospital was 26 days vs 18 days in the control group, Ñ=0.001).Conclusion Pulse therapy with high doses of GCS exerted a rapid anti-inflammatory effect but at the same time, increased the N/L ratio and the D-dimer level, which increased the risk of thromboembolism.","Mareev, V Yu; Orlova, Ya A; Pavlikova, E P; Matskeplishvili, S T; Krasnova, T N; Malahov, P S; Samokhodskaya, L M; Mershina, E A; Sinitsyn, V E; Mareev, Yu V; Kalinkin, A L; Begrambekova, Yu L; Kamalov, A A",Kardiologiia,661,13

METHODS: We collected epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological and occupation information, along with contact history, of 671 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 reported from January 23 to February 5, 2020, in Henan province, China. We described characteristics of these cases, compared the diagnostic accuracy and features of blood testing, computed tomography (CT) scans and X-rays, and analysed SARS-CoV-2 transmission sources and patients' occupations in Henan province. RESULTS: The mean age of patients in this case series was 43 years, 56.2% were male and 22.4% had coexisting medical disorders. The death rate was 0.3%. Fourteen patients did not show any symptoms. Lymphocyte percentage was associated with disease severity (&#967;2 = 6.71, P = 0.035) but had a large variation in each sample group. The mean time from illness onset to diagnosis was 5.6 days. A total of 330 patients had ever lived in or visited Wuhan, 150 had contact with confirmed cases, 323 had been to a hospital and 119 had been to a wet market. There were 33 patients who did not have a traceable transmission source, with 21.2% of these being farmers and 15.2% being workmen. CONCLUSIONS: Lymphocyte percentage was a sign of severe COVID-19 in general but was not a good diagnostic index. Longer time from illness onset to diagnosis was associated with higher COVID-19 severity, older age, higher likelihood of having coexisting cardiovascular diseases including hypertension, and being male. Farming was found to be a high-risk occupation in Henan province, China.","Nie, Yifei; Li, Jitian; Huang, Xueyong; Guo, Wanshen; Zhang, Xiaobai; Ma, Yan; Wang, Haifeng; Qi, Muge; Tang, Xiaoyan; Shen, Xiaojing; Dai, Xiaofeng",Int J Epidemiol,661,30

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted from May-August 2020 among diagnosed patients of chronic diseases residing in a COVID-19 hotspot of urban Jodhpur, Rajasthan, and availing health services from primary care facility. Telephonic interviews of participants were conducted to determine their health literacy using HLS-EU-Q47 questionnaire, adherence to COVID-19 preventive behaviour as per World Health Organization recommendations, and compliance to prescribed pharmacological and physical activity recommendations for chronic disease. RESULTS: All the 605 diagnosed patients of chronic diseases availing services from primary care facility were contacted for the study, yielding response rate of 68% with 412 agreeing to participate. Insufficient health literacy was observed for 65.8% participants. Only about half of participants had scored above median for COVID-19 awareness (55.1%) and preventive behavior (45.1%). Health literacy was observed to be significant predictor of COVID-19 awareness [aOR: 3.53 (95% CI: 1.81-6.88)]; COVID-19 preventive behavior [aOR: 2.06, 95%CI; 1.14-3.69] and compliance to pharmacological management [aOR: 3.05; 95% CI: 1.47-6.35] but not for physical activity. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 awareness, preventive behavior, and compliance to pharmacological management is associated with health literacy among patients of chronic disease availing services from primary health facility.

This study aimed to explore the key parameters of SARS-CoV-2 infection and to assess the effectiveness of interventions to control the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A susceptible-exposed-infectious-asymptomatic-recovered (SEIAR) model was developed for the assessment. The information of each confirmed case and asymptomatic infection was collected from Ningbo Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to calculate the key parameters of the model in Ningbo City, China. A total of 157 confirmed COVID-19 cases (including 51 imported cases and 106 secondary cases) and 30 asymptomatic infections were reported in Ningbo City. The proportion of asymptomatic infections had an increasing trend. The proportion of elder people in the asymptomatic infections was lower than younger people, and the difference was statistically significant (Fisher's Exact Test, P = 0.034). There were 22 clusters associated with 167 SARS-CoV-2 infections, among which 29 cases were asymptomatic infections, accounting for 17.37%. We found that the secondary attack rate (SAR) of asymptomatic infections was almost the same as that of symptomatic cases, and no statistical significance was observed (&#967;2 = 0.052, P = 0.819) by Kruskal-Wallis test. The effective reproduction number (Reff) was 1.43, which revealed that the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 was moderate. If the interventions had not been strengthened, the duration of the outbreak would have lasted about 16 months with a simulated attack rate of 44.15%. The total attack rate (TAR) and duration of the outbreak would increase along with the increasing delay of intervention. SARS-CoV-2 had moderate transmissibility in Ningbo City, China. The proportion of asymptomatic infections had an increase trend. Asymptomatic infections had the same transmissibility as symptomatic infections.

To address the potential endogeneity issues, we adopt an instrumental variable (IV) strategy, using the distance from the surveyed city to Wuhan as the instrumental variable. We show that our IV method is effective in minimizing potential bias. It is found that the share of confirmed COVID-19 cases increases the possibility of consumers purchasing food online. This is more likely to be the case for young people having a lower perceived risk of online purchases and living in large cities. Despite some limitations, this paper has policy implications for China and other countries that have been influenced by the COVID-19 epidemic. Specifically, government support and regulation should focus on (i) ensuring the safety of food sold on the internet, (ii) protecting the carrier from becoming infected, and (iii) providing financial support to the poor since they may have difficulties in obtaining access to food living in small cities. Moreover, how to help those who are unable to purchase food online because of their technical skills (e.g., the elderly who are not familiar with smart phones or the internet) also deserves more attention for the government and the public.","Gao, Xuwen; Shi, Xinjie; Guo, Hongdong; Liu, Yehong",PLoS One,661,9

An early clinical report showed that fever, cough, fatigue, sputum production, and myalgia were initial symptoms, with the development of pneumonia as the disease progressed. Increases in the level of serum liver enzymes, D-dimer, cardiac troponin I, and creatinine have been observed in severely ill patients, indicating that multiple organ failure had occurred in these cases. Lymphopenia and an increase in interleukin-6 (IL-6) were also observed. Although COVID-19 patients are administered glucocorticoid therapy to treat the excessive immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, the efficacy of this form of therapy is unclear. Viremia is observed in severe cases, suggesting that in addition to type II alveolar epithelial cells, many cell types, such as vascular endothelial cells, cardiomyocytes, renal tubular cells, neuronal cells, and lymphocytes, may be damaged. The improvement of survival rates requires elucidation of the mechanism by which cellular damage occurs during viral infection. Cellular therapy, along with organ support systems such as oxygen therapy, artificial ventilation, extra corporeal membrane oxygenation and dialysis, as well as antiviral therapy, are required. Viral replication in infected host cells may perturb protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), causing ER stress. Although an adaptive cellular response, i.e. the unfolded protein response, can compensate for the misfolded protein burden to some extent, continued viral proliferation may induce inflammation and cell death. Therefore, we propose that proteostasis dysfunction may cause conformational disorders in COVID-19. The application of pharmacological chaperone therapy to treat COVID-19 patients is additionally discussed.","Aoe, Tomohiko",Front. Pharmacol.,661,22

Migrant careworkers work and live with populations extremely vulnerable to the novel Coronavirus, including the elderly and people with pre-existing physical conditions. This rapid assessment aimed to explore psychosocial status and mental wellbeing of migrant careworkers in Israel during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and determine risk and protective factors associated with mental distress, anxiety, and depression. METHODS: This quantitative study was conducted via an online survey. The online survey collected social and demographic data, including country of origin, residence, age, sex, and time in Israel. In addition, questions were asked about knowledge of COVID-19 guidelines, access to supplies, and COVID-related racism. Respondents also completed a psychosocial screening tools, the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-10 (HSCL-10), which was used to screen for depression and anxiety. RESULTS: As of May 3rd, 2020, 307 careworkers responded to the online survey, of whom 120 (39.1%) were found symptomatic using the HSCL-10. Separating the HSCL-10 into subscales, 28.0% were symptomatically anxious, and 38.1% were symptomatic for depression. In multivariate regression, emotional distress was associated with household food insecurity (OR: 5.85; p < 0.001), lack of confidence to care for oneself and employer during the pandemic (OR: 3.85; p < 0.001), poorer general health (OR: 2.98; p < 0.003), non-Philippine country of origin (OR: 2.83; p < 0.01), female sex (OR: 2.34; p < 0.04),, and inversely associated with age (p < 0.03). While 87.6% of careworkers reported having access to hand sanitization materials regularly, only 58.0% had regular access to a medical grade mask, and 21.5% reported household food insecurity. Moreover, 40.0% of careworkers claimed to lack confidence to care for themselves and their employer during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Migrant careworkers exhibited high levels of mental distress during the COVID-19 lockdown, associated with lack of confidence or resources to properly care for themselves and their employer. Guidelines and support programs specific to the carework sector, that respect their rights and guard their health, must be developed as part of a coordinated COVID-19 response.","Attal, Jordan Hannink; Lurie, Ido; Neumark, Yehuda",Isr J Health Policy Res,661,24

Although the impact of acid suppression on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is unknown thus far, previous data revealed that pH &#8804;3 impairs the infectivity of the similar severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1. Thus, we aimed to determine whether use of PPIs increases the odds for acquiring coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among community-dwelling Americans. METHODS: From May 3 to June 24, 2020, we performed an online survey described to participating adults as a ""national health survey."" A multivariable logistic regression was performed on reporting a positive COVID-19 test to adjust for a wide range of confounding factors and to calculate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Of 53,130 participants, 3,386 (6.4%) reported a positive COVID-19 test. In regression analysis, individuals using PPIs up to once daily (aOR 2.15; 95% CI, 1.90-2.44) or twice daily (aOR 3.67; 95% CI, 2.93-4.60) had significantly increased odds for reporting a positive COVID-19 test when compared with those not taking PPIs. Individuals taking histamine-2 receptor antagonists were not at elevated risk. DISCUSSION: We found evidence of an independent, dose-response relationship between the use of antisecretory medications and COVID-19 positivity; individuals taking PPIs twice daily have higher odds for reporting a positive test when compared with those using lower-dose PPIs up to once daily, and those taking the less potent histamine-2 receptor antagonists are not at increased risk. These findings emphasize good clinical practice that PPIs should only be used when indicated at the lowest effective dose, such as the approved once-daily label dosage of over-the-counter and prescription PPIs. Further studies examining the association between PPIs and COVID-19 are needed.","Almario, Christopher V; Chey, William D; Spiegel, Brennan M R",Am J Gastroenterol,661,29

By contrast, the total number of COVID-19 deaths reported so far represents approximately 1.0% of the total deaths expected to occur worldwide over the first three months of the current year. It seems, therefore, that the number of infants expected to be conceived and born -but who will not be so due to the lockdown of infertility services- might be as significant as the total number of deaths attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic.

No study has correlated MPD size and malignancy considering the anatomic site of the gland (head versus body-tail). Our aim was to analyze the significance of MPD in pancreatic head/body-tail as a predictor of malignancy in main-duct/mixed IPMNs. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of resected patients between 2009-2018. Malignancy was defined as high-grade dysplasia and invasive carcinoma. MPD diameter was measured with magnetic resonance imaging. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was utilized to identify optimal MPD cut-off for malignancy. Independent predictors of malignancy were searched. RESULTS: Malignancy was detected in 74% of 312 identified patients. 213 patients (68.3%) had IPMNs of the pancreatic head and 99 (31.7%) of the body-tail. ROC analysis identified 9 and 7 mm as the optimal MPD cut-offs for malignancy in IPMNs of head and body-tail of the pancreas, respectively.

METHODS: To characterize buprenorphine availability, we conducted a telephone audit (""secret shopper"") study using a standardized script in two randomly selected pharmacies (one chain, one independent) in US counties reporting higher than average opioid overdose rates. Availability across pharmacy type (chain versus independent), county characteristics (rurality, region, overdose rate), and day of week were analyzed using univariate tests of categorical data. Independent predictors of buprenorphine availability were then identified using a multivariable binomial regression model. RESULTS: Among 921 pharmacies contacted (467 chain, 454 independent), 73 % were in urban counties and 42 % were in Southern states. Of these pharmacies, 675 (73 %) reported being able to dispense buprenorphine. There were 183 (20 %) pharmacies that indicated they would not dispense buprenorphine. Independent pharmacies (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR], 1.59; 95 % CI 1.21-2.08) and pharmacies in Southern states (aPR 2.06; 95 % CI 1.43-2.97) were significantly more likely to restrict buprenorphine. CONCLUSIONS: In US counties with high overdose mortality rates, one in five pharmacies indicated they would not dispense buprenorphine. Buprenorphine access limitations were more common among independent pharmacies and those in Southern states. Pharmacy-directed interventions may be necessary to ensure timely buprenorphine access for patients with opioid use disorder.","Kazerouni, Neda J; Irwin, Adriane N; Levander, Ximena A; Geddes, Jonah; Johnston, Kirbee; Gostanian, Carly J; Mayfield, Baylee S; Montgomery, Brandon T; Graalum, Diana C; Hartung, Daniel M",Drug Alcohol Depend,661,26

One scenario represents cases with known background of dementia, while the other scenario represents new referrals during the lockdown period with no known psychiatric background. In those cases, the visual hallucinations started during lockdown with no clear cause, did not respond to psychotropic medications, physical health investigations were all normal and hallucinations improved markedly with the end of the lockdown and social isolation.DiscussionFrom clinical practice point of view, during the period of lockdown in the COVID-19 pandemic, visual hallucinations has been one of the commonest presentations reported to the Community Mental Health Teams for Older People. Families were calling frequently reporting that their loved ones were “seeing things”. Possible underlying causes include: social isolation, sensory and perceptual deprivation, visual impairment and Charles Bonnet syndrome, lack of cognitive stimulation activities with progress of dementia, superimposed delirium, in addition to depression secondary to loneliness, reduction in community support, increased alcohol consumption and negative effects of repeated media consumption.ConclusionThere has been a marked increase in reporting visual hallucinations in the shielding older people population in the community during the period of lockdown in the COVID-19 pandemic. This shielded population was not exposed to COVID-19, so it didn't give an explanation to this new phenomenon. Though there are multiple possible causative factors, the effect of the lockdown itself with its resultant social isolation and sensory deprivation remains to be the most significant. Shielding the older people population throughout the COVID-19 pandemic came as an essential measure as the physical safety and preventing loss of lives was the priority;however the lockdown had significant negative effects on the mental health of the shielding population. It remains unclear if those negative effects are going to be reversible in the future, resulting in poor quality of life.","Roufael, Rim",BJPsych Open,661,26

Its role in coagulation and thrombosis is well-established. Nevertheless, thrombin also plays a major role in inflammation by activating protease-activated receptors. In addition, thrombin is also involved in angiogenesis, fibrosis, and viral infections. Considering the pathogenesis of COVID-19 pandemic, thrombin inhibitors may exert multiple potential therapeutic benefits including antithrombotic, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral activities. In this review, we describe the clinical features of COVID-19, the thrombin's roles in various pathologies, and the potential of argatroban in COVID-19 patients. Argatroban is a synthetic, small molecule, direct, competitive, and selective inhibitor of thrombin. It is approved to parenterally prevent and/or treat heparin-induced thrombocytopenia in addition to other thrombotic conditions. Argatroban also possesses anti-inflammatory and antiviral activities and has a well-established pharmacokinetics profile. It also appears to lack a significant risk of drug-drug interactions with therapeutics currently being evaluated for COVID-19. Thus, argatroban presents a substantial promise in treating severe cases of COVID-19; however, this promise is yet to be established in randomized, controlled clinical trials.","Aliter, Kholoud F; Al-Horani, Rami A",Cardiovasc. drugs ther,661,16

A variant of the classical compartmental SEIR model, called the SEIQRDP model, is used. As South Africa is still in the early phases of the global COVID-19 pandemic with the confirmed infectious cases not having peaked, the SEIQRDP model is first parameterized on data for Germany, Italy, and South Korea - countries for which the number of infectious cases are well past their peaks. Good fits are achieved with reasonable predictions of where the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases, deaths, and recovered cases will end up and by when. South African data for the period from 23 March to 8 May 2020 is then used to obtain SEIQRDP model parameters. It is found that the model fits the initial disease progression well, but that the long-term predictive capability of the model is rather poor. The South African SEIQRDP model is subsequently recalculated with the basic reproduction number constrained to reported values. The resulting model fits the data well, and long-term predictions appear to be reasonable. The South African SEIQRDP model predicts that the peak in the number of confirmed infectious individuals will occur at the end of October 2020, and that the total number of deaths will range from about 10,000 to 90,000, with a nominal value of about 22,000. All of these predictions are heavily dependent on the disease control measures in place, and the adherence to these measures. These predictions are further shown to be particularly sensitive to parameters used to determine the basic reproduction number. The future aim is to use a feedback control approach together with the South African SEIQRDP model to determine the epidemiological impact of varying lockdown levels proposed by the South African Government.","Olivier, L.

Given the consequences of these policies, it is important to assess their effects. We evaluate the effects on epidemic case growth of more restrictive NPIs (mrNPIs), above and beyond those of less-restrictive NPIs (lrNPIs). METHODS: We first estimate COVID-19 case growth in relation to any NPI implementation in subnational regions of 10 countries: England, France, Germany, Iran, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, South Korea, Sweden and the United States. Using first-difference models with fixed effects, we isolate the effects of mrNPIs by subtracting the combined effects of lrNPIs and epidemic dynamics from all NPIs. We use case growth in Sweden and South Korea, 2 countries that did not implement mandatory stay-at-home and business closures, as comparison countries for the other 8 countries (16 total comparisons). RESULTS: Implementing any NPIs was associated with significant reductions in case growth in 9 out of 10 study countries, including South Korea and Sweden that implemented only lrNPIs (Spain had a nonsignificant effect). After subtracting the epidemic and lrNPI effects, we find no clear, significant beneficial effect of mrNPIs on case growth in any country. In France, for example, the effect of mrNPIs was +7% (95% CI: -5%-19%) when compared with Sweden and + 13% (-12%-38%) when compared with South Korea (positive means pro-contagion). The 95% confidence intervals excluded 30% declines in all 16 comparisons and 15% declines in 11/16 comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: While small benefits cannot be excluded, we do not find significant benefits on case growth of more restrictive NPIs. Similar reductions in case growth may be achievable with less-restrictive interventions.","Bendavid, Eran; Oh, Christopher; Bhattacharya, Jay; Ioannidis, John P A",Eur J Clin Invest,661,21

This outbreak warns diagnosing infected people is an important issue. So, in this research, a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system called COV-CAD is proposed for diagnosing COVID-19 disease. This COV-CAD system is created by a feature extractor, a classification method, and a content-based imaged retrieval (CBIR) system. The proposed feature extractor is created by using the modified AlexNet CNN. The first modification changes ReLU activation functions to LeakyReLU for increasing efficiency. The second change is converting a fully connected (FC) layer of AlexNet CNN with a new FC, which results in reducing learnable parameters and training time. Another FC layer with dimensions 1 × 64 is added at the end of the feature extractor as the feature vector. In the classification section, a new classification method is defined in which the majority voting technique is applied on outputs of CBIR, SVM, KNN, and Random Forest for final diagnosing. Furthermore, in retrieval section, the proposed method uses CBIR because of its ability to retrieve the most similar images to the image of a patient. Since this feature helps physicians to find the most similar cases, they could conduct further statistical evaluations on profiles of similar patients. The system has been evaluated by accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1-score, and mean average precision and its accuracy for CT and X-ray datasets is 93.20% and 99.38%, respectively. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is more efficient than other similar studies.","Shakarami, Ashkan; Menhaj, Mohammad Bagher; Tarrah, Hadis",Optik (Stuttg),661,16

METHODS: We systematically reviewed the literature for ECGs of patients with diLQTS and subsequent TdP. We assessed T-wave morphology in each lead and measured the longest QT interval in the limb and chest leads in a standardized fashion. RESULTS: Of 84 patients, 61.9% were female and mean age was 58.8 years. QTc was significantly longer in chest versus limb leads (mean (standard deviation) 671 (102) vs 655 (97) ms, p=0.02). Using only limb leads for QT interpretation, 18 (21.4%) ECGs were non-interpretable: 10 (11.9%) due to too flat T-waves, 7 (8.3%) due to frequent, early PVCs and 1 (1.2%) due to too low ECG recording quality. In the chest leads, ECGs were non-interpretable in 9 (10.7%) patients: 6 (7.1%) due to frequent, early PVCs, 1 (1.2%) due to insufficient ECG quality, 2 (2.4%) due to missing chest leads but none due to too flat T-waves. The most common T-wave morphologies in the limb leads were flat (51.0%), broad (14.3%) and late peaking (12.6%) T-waves. Corresponding chest lead morphologies were inverted (35.5%), flat (19.6%) and biphasic (15.2%) T-waves. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that QT evaluation by limb leads only underestimates the incidence of diLQTS experiencing TdP and favors the screening using both limb and chest lead ECG.

A feedback cycle between nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) defect and TDP-43 aggregation was shown to contribute to accumulation of TDP-43 in the cytoplasm. However, little is known about cellular factors that can control the activity of NCT, thereby affecting TDP-43 accumulation in the cytoplasm. Here, we identified via FRAP and optogenetics cytosolic calcium as a key cellular factor controlling NCT of TDP-43. Dynamic and reversible changes in TDP-43 localization were observed in Drosophila sensory neurons during development. Genetic and immunohistochemical analyses identified the cytosolic calcium-Calpain-A-Importin &#945;3 pathway as a regulatory mechanism underlying NCT of TDP-43. In C9orf72 ALS fly models, upregulation of the pathway activity by increasing cytosolic calcium reduced cytoplasmic accumulation of TDP-43 and mitigated behavioral defects.

Besides, retrospective studies, improved lab-based detection methods and the intensified search for new viruses since the beginning of the twenty-first century led to the discovery of several novel respiratory viruses. Among them are human bocavirus (HBoV), human coronaviruses (HCoV-HKU1, -NL63), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), rhinovirus type C (RV-C), and human polyomaviruses (KIPyV, WUPyV). Additionally, new viruses like SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV), novel strains of influenza virus A and B, and (most recently) SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have emerged. Although clinical presentation may be similar among different viruses, associated symptoms may range from a mild cold to a severe respiratory illness, and thus require a fast and reliable diagnosis. The increasing number of commercially available rapid point-of-care tests (POCTs) for respiratory viruses illustrates both the need for this kind of tests but also the problem, i.e., that the majority of such assays has significant limitations. In this review, we summarize recently published characteristics of POCTs and discuss their implications for the treatment of RTIs. The second key aspect of this work is a description of new and innovative diagnostic techniques, ranging from biosensors to novel portable and current lab-based nucleic acid amplification methods with the potential future use in point-of-care settings. While prototypes for some methods already exist, other ideas are still experimental, but all of them give an outlook of what can be expected as the next generation of POCTs.","Nelson, Philipp P; Rath, Barbara A; Fragkou, Paraskevi C; Antalis, Emmanouil; Tsiodras, Sotirios; Skevaki, Chrysanthi",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,661,24

Prior empirical studies have shown that adult children of Holocaust survivors (OHS, also referred to in select quotes as 2G for ""Second Generation"") are vulnerable to life-threatening situations. This study aimed to examine the reactions of OHS to the COVID-19 pandemic, which posed a serious threat to the lives of many, in particular to older adults. As they enter middle age, OHS were observed to have more medical health issues and less positive perceptions of their own aging relative to peers. Less positive subjective aging was associated with more negative psychiatric symptoms in relation to Covid-19-related loneliness, further suggesting that OHS are a group of aging adults with particular vulnerabilities to negative mental health effects of the pandemic and of the social distancing and isolation it imposed. This study is a qualitative report of experiences expressed by over 1,200 participants in several web-based interactive webinars for OHS during the period of ""shelter at home"" in March and April 2020. It is proposed that this format of ""web-based, second-best"" way of being together, an intervention that emerged spontaneously in response to the coronavirus and social distancing, offers a novel, nonpathologizing, effective form of supportive psychosocial intervention uniquely suited to the unprecedented challenges experienced during times requiring social distancing.

PURPOSE: The current research asks: How well does the public's perception of such policies align with actual policies, and how well do actual versus perceived policies predict the public's mask-wearing and social distancing behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic? METHODS: We conducted a preregistered cross-sectional study among 1,073 online participants who were representative of the U.S. population on age, gender, and education on Monday-Tuesday, July 20-21, 2020. We asked participants which locations they visited in the past weekend, and their mask-wearing and social distancing behaviors at each location. We also measured participants' beliefs about their state's policies on mask mandate and business opening and obtained objective measures of these policies from publicly available data. RESULTS: Perception about the existence of mask mandate was 91% accurate in states with a mask mandate but only 46% accurate in states without one. Perception of state reopening level did not correlate with policy. It was the perceived but not actual state mask mandate that positively predicted both mask-wearing and social distancing, controlling for state COVID-19 cases, demographic factors, and participants' numeracy and COVID-19 history. CONCLUSIONS: The public's perception of state-level mask mandates erred on the side of assuming there is one. Perception of reopening is almost completely inaccurate. Paradoxically, public perception that a mask mandate exists predicts preventive behaviors better than actual mandates.","Li, Meng; Colby, Helen",Ann. behav. med,661,1

In the case of the coronavirus pandemic, accurate threat appraisal is difficult due to incomplete medical knowledge as well as complex social factors (e.g., mixed public health messages). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the degree to which individuals accurately perceive COVID-19 infection rates and to explore the role of COVID-19 threat perception on emotional and behavioral responses both cross sectionally and prospectively. METHODS: A community sample (N = 249) was assessed using online crowdsourcing and followed for one month. COVID-19 threat appraisal was compared with actual COVID-19 infection rates and deaths at the time of data collection in each participant's county and state. It was predicted that actual versus perceived COVID-19 infection rates would only be modestly associated. Relative to actual infection rates, perceived infection rates were hypothesized to be a better predictor of COVID-related behaviors, distress, and impairment. RESULTS: Findings indicated that relative to actual infection, perceived infection was a better predictor of COVID-related outcomes cross sectionally and longitudinally. Interestingly, actual infection rates were negatively related to behaviors cross sectionally (e.g., less stockpiling). Prospectively, these variables interacted to predict avoidance behaviors over time such that the relationship between perceived infection and avoidance was stronger as actual infection increased. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that perceived COVID-19 infection is significantly associated with COVID-related behaviors, distress and impairment whereas actual infection rates have a less important and perhaps even paradoxical influence on behavioral responses to the pandemic.","Schmidt, Norman B; Martin, Alex D; Allan, Nicholas P; Mathes, Brittany M; Saulnier, Kevin G; March, David S",J Psychiatr Res,661,21

This study was conducted to provide the international community with a deeper understanding of this new infectious disease. Epidemiological, clinical features, laboratory findings, radiological characteristics, treatment, and clinical outcomes of 135 patients in northeast Chongqing were collected and analyzed in this study. A total of 135 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. The median age was 47 years (interquartile range, 36-55), and there was no significant gender difference (53.3% men). The majority of patients had contact with people from the Wuhan area. Forty-three (31.9%) patients had underlying disease, primarily hypertension (13 [9.6%]), diabetes (12 [8.9%]), cardiovascular disease (7 [5.2%]), and malignancy (4 [3.0%]). Common symptoms included fever (120 [88.9%]), cough (102 [76.5%]), and fatigue (44 [32.5%]). Chest computed tomography scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all the patients. All patients received antiviral therapy (135 [100%]) (Kaletra and interferon were both used), antibacterial therapy (59 [43.7%]), and corticosteroids (36 [26.7%]). In addition, many patients received traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) (124 [91.8%]). It is suggested that patients should receive Kaletra early and should be treated by a combination of Western and Chinese medicines. Compared to the mild cases, the severe ones had lower lymphocyte counts and higher plasma levels of Pt, APTT, d-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, PCT, ALB, C-reactive protein, and aspartate aminotransferase. This study demonstrates the clinic features and therapies of 135 COVID-19 patients. Kaletra and TCM played an important role in the treatment of the viral pneumonia. Further studies are required to explore the role of Kaletra and TCM in the treatment of COVID-19.","Wan, Suxin; Xiang, Yi; Fang, Wei; Zheng, Yu; Li, Boqun; Hu, Yanjun; Lang, Chunhui; Huang, Daoqiu; Sun, Qiuyan; Xiong, Yan; Huang, Xia; Lv, Jinglong; Luo, Yaling; Shen, Li; Yang, Haoran; Huang, Gu; Yang, Ruishan",J Med Virol,661,20

After the emergence of this virus, it became a global public health concern and quickly evolved into a pandemic. Mexico is currently in the third position in the number of deaths due to SARS-CoV-2. To date, there have been several lineages of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide; in the Mexican population, two variants of the spike protein (S-protein) are found, localized at H49Y and D614G, which have been related to increased infectivity with respect to the wild-type S-protein. To understand how these differences impact the structural behavior of the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2, as well as binding with ACE2, we performed MD simulations combined with the molecular mechanics generalized Born/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MMGB(PB)SA) approach starting from X-ray crystallography data. Energetic and structural analysis showed that the differences in infectivity can be explained by differences in affinity of the protein-protein interface between the wild-type and mutant S-protein with ACE2. Conformational analysis showed that molecular recognition between the S-protein and ACE2 is linked to a decrease in the conformational flexibility of wild-type and mutant S-protein; however, an increase in the conformational mobility of ACE2 could also contribute to the binding affinity observed using the MMGB(PB)SA method.","Bello, Martiniano; Hasan, Md Kamrul; Hussain, Nazmul",J Mol Graph Model,661,16

Most of the existing work in this domain has focused on settings that assume perfectly accurate sampling approaches, which is seldom true in practical data science. Here we introduce the first known approach to support estimation in the presence of sampling artifacts and errors where each sample is assumed to arise from a Poisson repeat channel which simultaneously captures repetitions and deletions of samples. The proposed estimator is based on regularized weighted Chebyshev approximations, with weights governed by evaluations of so-called Touchard (Bell) polynomials. The supports in the presence of sampling artifacts are calculated using discretized semi-infite programming methods. The estimation approach is tested on synthetic and textual data, as well as on GISAID data collected to address a new problem in computational biology: mutational support estimation in genes of the SARS-Cov-2 virus. In the later setting, the Poisson channel captures the fact that many individuals are tested multiple times for the presence of viral RNA, thereby leading to repeated samples, while other individual's results are not recorded due to test errors. For all experiments performed, we observed significant improvements of our integrated methods compared to those obtained through adequate modifications of state-of-the-art noiseless support estimation methods.","Chien, Eli; Milenkovic, Olgica; Nedich, Angelia",,661,2

(Special Issue: COVID-19 pandemic.),18.202913,4.1486855,2020,"BACKGROUND: The internet has become an important source of health information among people across the globe. However, the novel coronavirus outbreak has led to a broader dissemination of fake and misleading health information. While health professionals may be able to critically evaluate internet-based information, the skills at finding, appraising, and using COVID-19-related online information may be problematic for laypeople in low-income countries. The purpose of this study was to examine the digital literacy of lay consumers of online COVID-19-related information in Ghana. METHOD: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among online health consumers across five regions in Ghana. Participants were conveniently recruited through social media, and the survey was based on the eHealth Literacy Scale (eHeals) and administered through Qualtricsxm software. We calculated the overall mean eHeals score to determine the literacy levels and performed descriptive statistics to describe the characteristics of the sample. Linear regression analysis was performed to determine the factors associated with respondents' digital literacy. RESULT: Out of 700 respondents sent with a survey link, 325 responded (46.4 % response rate). The majority of the respondents were: younger than 31 years (M = 28.42, SD = 6.98), males (59.7 %), use the internet daily (94.4 %), engaged in social media activities (65 %), and frequently search the internet for information related to COVID-19. The overall eHealth literacy was quite high (M = 4.01, SD = 0.95), but respondents' scores on items 1 and 6 were relatively low. Sex, age, frequently searching the internet for COVID-19 information, using the internet for educational purposes, and having a little/adequate knowledge of COVID-19 was predictive of digital literacy. CONCLUSION: The study revealed a high overall digital literacy as well as sex and age differences in literacy levels among online health consumers in Ghana.

Several studies have described typical clinical manifestations including fever, cough, diarrhea, and fatigue. However, to our knowledge, it has not been reported that patients with COVID-19 had any neurologic manifestations. Objective: To study the neurologic manifestations of patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This is a retrospective, observational case series. Data were collected from January 16, 2020, to February 19, 2020, at 3 designated special care centers for COVID-19 (Main District, West Branch, and Tumor Center) of the Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China. The study included 214 consecutive hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. Main Outcomes and Measures: Clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records, and data of all neurologic symptoms were checked by 2 trained neurologists. Neurologic manifestations fell into 3 categories: central nervous system manifestations (dizziness, headache, impaired consciousness, acute cerebrovascular disease, ataxia, and seizure), peripheral nervous system manifestations (taste impairment, smell impairment, vision impairment, and nerve pain), and skeletal muscular injury manifestations. Results: Of 214 patients (mean [SD] age, 52.7 [15.5] years; 87 men [40.7%]) with COVID-19, 126 patients (58.9%) had nonsevere infection and 88 patients (41.1%) had severe infection according to their respiratory status. Overall, 78 patients (36.4%) had neurologic manifestations. Compared with patients with nonsevere infection, patients with severe infection were older, had more underlying disorders, especially hypertension, and showed fewer typical symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever and cough. Patients with more severe infection had neurologic manifestations, such as acute cerebrovascular diseases (5 [5.7%] vs 1 [0.8%]), impaired consciousness (13 [14.8%] vs 3 [2.4%]), and skeletal muscle injury (17 [19.3%] vs 6 [4.8%]). Conclusions and Relevance: Patients with COVID-19 commonly have neurologic manifestations. During the epidemic period of COVID-19, when seeing patients with neurologic manifestations, clinicians should suspect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection as a differential diagnosis to avoid delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis and lose the chance to treat and prevent further transmission.","Mao, Ling; Jin, Huijuan; Wang, Mengdie; Hu, Yu; Chen, Shengcai; He, Quanwei; Chang, Jiang; Hong, Candong; Zhou, Yifan; Wang, David; Miao, Xiaoping; Li, Yanan; Hu, Bo",JAMA Neurol,661,12

In an extraordinary manner, COVID-19 is affecting human life and has transformed a global public health issue into a crisis. Natural products are already recognized owing to the massive advantageous window and efficient antioxidant, antiviral immunomodulatory, and anti-inflammatory belongings. Additionally, the object of the present study was to demonstrate the inhibitory potential of the natural products coumarins and its analogues alongside SARS coronavirus. The present work, focuses on the synthesis of new coumarin analogues and characterized by FT-IR, 1H and 13C NMR, elemental analyses, and mass spectra. The recently synthesised compounds were projected conceptual association for COVID-19 protease and also to explore in anticipation if this protein will help target protease inhibitor drugs such as Calanolide A, Cardatolide A, Collinin, Inophyllum A, Mesuol, Isomesuol, Pteryxin, Rutamarin, Seselin and Suksdorin. The natural coumarin analogues docking scores were compared to standard Hydroxychloroquine. While the 3D module of SARS coronavirus main protease was predicted with the SWISS MODEL web server, as well as biochemical interaction tests were performed with the AutoDock Vina tool between the target protein with ligands. This research further showed that all the protease inhibitors accessed the target protein with negative dock energy. Molecular docking studies found that the natural coumarin analogue Inophyllum A showed an exceptional potential for inhibition with a binding energy of -8.4 kcal/mol. The synthetic coumarin analogues 1 m and 1p both demonstrated a similar binding energy, inhibition potential of -7.9 kcal / mol as opposed to hydroxychloroquine and co-crystallized ligand alpha-ketoamide with binding energy values of -5.8 and -6.6 kcal / mol. All compounds evaluated were known as drug-like in nature, passing Lipinski's ""Law of 5"" with 0 violations except for alpha-ketoamide, passing Lipinski's ""Rule of 5"" with 1 MW > 500 violations. The inhibitor binding in silico research thus offers a structural understanding of COVID-19 and molecular interactions across the known protease inhibitors centred on the findings of the multiple sequence alliance.","Sathish Kumar, Chidambaram; El-Sheikh, Mohamed A; Alfarhan, Ahmed H; SurendraKumar, Radhakrishnan; Idhayadhulla, Akbar",,661,8

Epidemiological evidence points to important health benefits of immediate ART initiation; however, the policy's economic impact remains unknown. Methods: We conducted a stepped-wedge cluster-randomised controlled trial in Eswatini to determine the causal impact of immediate ART initiation on patients' economic welfare. Fourteen healthcare facilities were non-randomly matched in pairs and then randomly allocated to transition from the standard of care (ART eligibility at CD4 counts of < 350 cells/mm3 until September 2016 and <500 cells/mm3 thereafter) to the 'Early Initiation of ART for All' (EAAA) intervention at one of seven timepoints. Patients, healthcare personnel, and outcome assessors remained unblinded. Data was collected via standardised paper-based surveys with HIV-positive, ART-naïve adults who were neither pregnant nor breastfeeding. Outcomes were patients' time use, employment status, household expenditures and household wealth. Results: A total sample of 3,019 participants were interviewed over the duration of the study. The mean number of participants approached at each facility and time step varied from 4 to 112 participants. Using mixed-effects negative binomial regressions accounting for time trends and clustering, we found no significant difference between study arms for any economic outcome. Specifically, the EAAA intervention had no significant effect on non-resting time use (RR= 1.00, [CI: 0.96, 1.05, p=0.93]) or income-generating time use (RR= 0.94, [CI: 0.73,1.20, p=0.61]). Employment and household expenditures decreased slightly but not significantly in the EAAA group, with risk ratios of 0.93 [CI: 0.82, 1.04, p=0.21] and 0.92 [CI: 0.79, 1.06, p=0.26], respectively. We also found no significant treatment effect on households' asset ownership and living standards (RR=0.96, [CI 0.92, 1.00, p=0.253]). Lastly, there was no evidence of heterogeneity in effect estimates by patients' sex, age, education, timing of HIV diagnosis and ART initiation. Conclusions: Given the neutral effect on patients' economic welfare but positive effects on health, our findings support further investments into scaling-up immediate ART for all HIV patients.

Understanding workers' knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) regarding this new infectious disease is crucial to preventing and controlling it. This study aimed to assess KAP regarding COVID-19 during the outbreak among workers in China. The present study was part of a cross-sectional online survey study conducted based on a large labor-intensive factory, which has 180,000 workers from various Chinese provinces, from 2 February 2020 to 7 February 2020. KAP related to COVID-19 were measured by 32 items, each item was measured with an agree/disagree/unclear format, and only correct responses were given 1 point. KAP regarding COVID-19 were measured with 20 items, 6 items and 6 items, respectively. A total of 123,768 valid responses (68.8%) were included in the analysis. Generally, the levels of knowledge (mean: 16.3 out of 20 points), attitudes (mean: 4.5 out of 6 points), and practices (mean: 5.8 out of 6 points) related to COVID-19 were high.

Fifteen out of 533 (2.8%) positive ELISA results were detected;in wild boars (3.9%), red foxes (2.9%) and jackals (4.6%). However, the positive findings were not confirmed by sVNT. No viral RNA was found. In conclusion, no spillover occurred within the investigated period (second COVID-19 wave). However, further investigation is needed, especially regarding wildlife sample features for serological tests.","Jemeršić, Lorena Lojkić Ivana Krešić Nina Keros Tomislav Zelenika Tajana Amšel Jurinović Luka Skok Damir Bata Ingeborg Boras Jadranko Habrun Boris Brnić Dragan",Pathogens,661,16

DESIGN: A systematic review of studies published between January 2019 and October 2020 without study design or language restrictions. SETTING: Data sourced from Ovid Embase Classic+Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, relevant bibliographies and the John Hopkins University COVID-19 database. PATIENTS: Mothers with confirmed COVID-19 and breastmilk tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR or for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Presence of SARS-CoV-2 genome and antibodies in breastmilk. RESULTS: We included 50 articles. Twelve out of 183 women from 48 studies were positive for SARS-CoV-2 genome in their breastmilk (pooled proportion 5% (95% CI 2% to 15%; I2=48%)). Six infants (50%) of these 12 mothers tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, with one requiring respiratory support. Sixty-one out of 89 women from 10 studies had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody in their breastmilk (pooled proportion 83% (95% CI 32% to 98%; I2=88%)). The predominant antibody detected was IgA. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 genome presence in breastmilk is uncommon and is associated with mild symptoms in infants. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may be a more common finding. Considering the low proportion of SARS-CoV-2 genome detected in breastmilk and its lower virulence, mothers with COVID-19 should be supported to breastfeed.","Zhu, Faith; Zozaya, Carlos; Zhou, Qi; De Castro, Charmaine; Shah, Prakesh S",Arch. dis. child. fetal neonatal ed,661,20

Relative to existing efforts, we find that both instructional interventions increased COVID-19-related knowledge immediately after intervention. Relative to the shorter fact-based intervention, the longer intervention resulted in sustained improvements in knowledge, attitudes, and self-reported behavior.

The aim of this study was to investigate how individual-level housing and neighbourhood characteristics are associated with COVID-19 mortality in older adults. Methods For this population-based, observational study, we used data from the cause-of-death register held by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare to identify recorded COVID-19 mortality and mortality from other causes among individuals (aged &gt;= 70 years) in Stockholm county, Sweden, between March 12 and May 8, 2020. This information was linked to population-register data from December, 2019, including socioeconomic, demographic, and residential characteristics. We ran Cox proportional hazards regressions for the risk of dying from COVID-19 and from all other causes. The independent variables were area (m(2)) per individual in the household, the age structure of the household, type of housing, confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the borough, and neighbourhood population density. All models were adjusted for individual age, sex, country of birth, income, and education. Findings Of 279 961 individuals identified to be aged 70 years or older on March 12, 2020, and residing in Stockholm in December, 2019, 274 712 met the eligibility criteria and were included in the study population. Between March 12 and May 8, 2020, 3386 deaths occurred, of which 1301 were reported as COVID-19 deaths. In fully adjusted models, household and neighbourhood characteristics were independently associated with COVID-19 mortality among older adults. Compared with living in a household with individuals aged 66 years or older, living with someone of working age (&lt;66 years) was associated with increased COVID-19 mortality (hazard ratio 1.6;95% CI 1.3-2.0). Living in a care home was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 mortality (4.1;3.5-4.9) compared with living in independent housing. Living in neighbourhoods with the highest population density (&gt;= 5000 individuals per km(2)) was associated with higher COVID-19 mortality (1.7;1.1-2.4) compared with living in the least densely populated neighbourhoods (0 to &lt;150 individuals per km(2)). Interpretation Close exposure to working-age household members and neighbours is associated with increased COVID-19 mortality among older adults. Similarly, living in a care home is associated with increased mortality, potentially through exposure to visitors and care workers, but also due to poor underlying health among care-home residents. These factors should be considered when developing strategies to protect this group. Copyright (C) 2020 The Author(s).

The aim of this study was to evaluate chest X-ray and chest CT findings in children with COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: Chest X-ray findings of 59 pediatric patients and chest CT findings of 22 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated retrospectively. RESULTS: COVID-19 pneumonia was most commonly observed unilaterally and in lower zones of lungs in chest X-ray examinations. Bilateral and multifocal involvement (55%) was the most observed involvement in the CT examinations, as well as, single lesion and single lobe (27%) involvement were also detected. Pure ground-glass appearance was observed in 41%, ground-glass appearance and consolidation together was in 36%. While peripheral and central co-distribution of the lesions (55%) were frequently observed, the involvement of the lower lobes (69%) was significant. In four cases,the coexistence of multiple rounded multifocal ground-glass appearance and rounded consolidation were observed. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pneumonia imaging findings may differ in the pediatric population from adults. In diagnosis, chest X-ray should be preferred, CT should be requested if there is a pathologic finding on radiography that merits further evaluation and if clinically indicated. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Radiological findings of COVID-19 observed in children may differ from adults. Chest X-ray should often be sufficient in children avoiding additional irradiation, chest CT needs only be done in cases of clinical necessity.","Palabiyik, Figen; Kokurcan, Suna Ors; Hatipoglu, Nevin; Cebeci, Sinem Oral; Inci, Ercan",Br J Radiol,661,16

Published results obtained recently at this laboratory show that D. radiodurans submitted to ionizing radiation results in its DNA being shattered into small fragments which, when exposed to a ""static electric field' (SEF), greatly decreases cell viability. These findings motivated the performing of D. radiodurans exposed to gamma radiation, yet exposed to a different exogenous physical agent, ""static magnetic fields"" (SMF). Cells of D. radiodurans [strain D.r. GY 9613 (R1)] in the exponential phase were submitted to 60Co gamma radiation from a gamma cell. Samples were exposed to doses in the interval 0.5-12.5 kGy, while the control samples were kept next to the irradiation setup. Exposures to SMF were carried out with intensities of 0.08 T and 0.8 T delivered by two settings: (a) a device built up at this laboratory with niobium magnets, delivering 0.08 T, and (b) an electromagnet (Walker Scientific) generating static magnetic fields with intensities from 0.1 to 0.8 T. All samples were placed in a bacteriological incubator at 30 °C for 48 h, and after incubation, a counting of colony forming units was performed. Two sets of cell surviving data were measured, each in triplicate, obtained in independent experiments. A remarkable similarity between the two data sets is revealed, underscoring reproducibility within the 5% range. Appraisal of raw data shows that exposure of irradiated cells to SMF substantially increases their viability. Data interpretation strongly suggests that the increase of D. radiodurans cell viability is a sole magnetic physical effect, driven by a stochastic process, improving the efficiency of the rejoining of DNA fragments, thus increasing cell viability. A type of cut-off dose is identified at 10 kGy, above which the irradiated cellular system loses recovery and the cell survival mechanism collapses.","Righi, Henriette; Arruda-Neto, João D T; Gomez, José G C; da Silva, Luiziana F; Somessari, Elizabeth S R; Lemos, Aline C C",J Biol Phys,661,22

Our study aims to investigate the 30-day mortality rate of hip fracture patients during the first 30 days of the pandemic in the United Kingdom. METHODS: A single-center, observational, prospective study of patients presenting with hip fractures. Data collection started from ""day 0"" of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom and continued for 30 days. We collected data on time to surgery, Clinical Frailty Scale score, Nottingham Hip Fracture Score, COVID-19 infection status, 30-day mortality, and cause of death. For comparison, we collected retrospective data during the same 30-day period in 2018, 2019, and the previous 6 months (Control groups A, B, and C, respectively). RESULTS: Forty-three patients were included in the study. There was no difference in age or gender between the Study and Control groups. The 30-day mortality rate of the Study group was 16.3%, which was higher than Control groups A (P = 0.022), B (P = 0.003) and C (P = 0.001). The prevalence of COVID-19 infection in our Study group was 26%. Of the 7 mortalities recorded, 4 patients tested positive for COVID-19 infection.

Public health authorities (PHAs) are increasingly adopting the use of social media such as Facebook to rapidly communicate and disseminate pandemic response measures to the public. Understanding of communication strategies across different PHAs and examining the public response on the social media landscapes can help improve practices for disseminating information to the public. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine COVID-19-related outreach efforts of PHAs in Singapore, the United States, and England, and the corresponding public response to these outreach efforts on Facebook. METHODS: Posts and comments from the Facebook pages of the Ministry of Health (MOH) in Singapore, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States, and Public Health England (PHE) in England were extracted from January 1, 2019, to March 18, 2020. Posts published before January 1, 2020, were categorized as pre-COVID-19, while the remaining posts were categorized as peri-COVID-19 posts. COVID-19-related posts were identified and classified into themes. Metrics used for measuring outreach and engagement were frequency, mean posts per day (PPD), mean reactions per post, mean shares per post, and mean comments per post. Responses to the COVID-19 posts were measured using frequency, mean sentiment polarity, positive to negative sentiments ratio (PNSR), and positive to negative emotions ratio (PNER). Toxicity in comments were identified and analyzed using frequency, mean likes per toxic comment, and mean replies per toxic comment. Trend analysis was performed to examine how the metrics varied with key events such as when COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. RESULTS: The MOH published more COVID-19 posts (n=271; mean PPD 5.0) compared to the CDC (n=94; mean PPD 2.2) and PHE (n=45; mean PPD 1.4). The mean number of comments per COVID-19 post was highest for the CDC (mean CPP 255.3) compared to the MOH (mean CPP 15.6) and PHE (mean CPP 12.5). Six major themes were identified, with posts about prevention and safety measures and situation updates being prevalent across the three PHAs. The themes of the MOH's posts were diverse, while the CDC and PHE posts focused on a few themes. Overall, response sentiments for the MOH posts (PNSR 0.94) were more favorable compared to response sentiments for the CDC (PNSR 0.57) and PHE (PNSR 0.55) posts. Toxic comments were rare (0.01%) across all PHAs. CONCLUSIONS: PHAs' extent of Facebook use for outreach purposes during the COVID-19 pandemic varied among the three PHAs, highlighting the strategies and approaches that other PHAs can potentially adopt. Our study showed that social media analysis was capable of providing insights about the communication strategies of PHAs during disease outbreaks.","Sesagiri Raamkumar, Aravind; Tan, Soon Guan; Wee, Hwee Lin",J Med Internet Res,661,27

Indeed, several preclinical and clinical studies have suggested that this condition may induce susceptibility and the development of more aggressive infectious diseases, especially those caused by some bacteria (including Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, among others) and viruses [such as coronavirus 2 (CoV2), Influenza A virus, Hepatitis B, etc.]. Although the precise mechanisms that link glycemia to the exacerbated infections remain elusive, hyperglycemia is known to induce a wide array of changes in the immune system activity, including alterations in: (i) the microenvironment of immune cells (e.g., pH, blood viscosity and other biochemical parameters); (ii) the supply of energy to infectious bacteria; (iii) the inflammatory response; and (iv) oxidative stress as a result of bacterial proliferative metabolism. Consistent with this evidence, some bacterial infections are typical (and/or have a worse prognosis) in patients with hypercaloric diets and a stressful lifestyle (conditions that promote hyperglycemic episodes). On this basis, the present review is particularly focused on: (i) the role of diabetes in the development of some bacterial and viral infections by analyzing preclinical and clinical findings; (ii) discussing the possible mechanisms by which hyperglycemia may increase the susceptibility for developing infections; and (iii) further understanding the impact of hyperglycemia on the immune system.","Chávez-Reyes, Jesús; Escárcega-González, Carlos E; Chavira-Suárez, Erika; León-Buitimea, Angel; Vázquez-León, Priscila; Morones-Ramírez, José R; Villalón, Carlos M; Quintanar-Stephano, Andrés; Marichal-Cancino, Bruno A",Front Public Health,661,24

The Health Check includes calculation of CVD risk and discussion of pharmacological and lifestyle approaches to manage risk, including referral to lifestyle support services. The programme is commissioned by Local Authorities (LAs) and is delivered by a range of different providers in different settings. There is significant variation in activity, with uptake ranging from 25% to 85% in different areas, and clear evidence of variation in implementation and delivery practice. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We aim to understand how the NHS Health Check programme works in different settings, for different groups, so that we can recommend improvements to maximise intended outcomes. To do so, we will undertake a realist review and a survey of LA public health teams. Our review will follow Pawson's five iterative stages: (1) locate existing theories, (2) search for evidence, (3) article selection, (4) extract and organise data and (5) synthesise evidence and draw conclusions. Our review will include documents describing local implementation alongside published research studies. We will recruit a stakeholder group (including Public Health England, commissioners and providers of Health Checks, plus members of the public and patients) to advise us throughout. Our survey will be sent to all 152 LAs in England to gather detailed information on programme delivery (including COVID-19-related changes) and available referral services. This will enable us to map delivery across England and relate these data to programme outcomes. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not required for this review. For the survey, we have received approval from the University of Kent Research Ethics Committee. Our findings will be used to develop recommendations on tailoring, implementation and design strategies to improve delivery of the NHS Health Check in different settings, for different groups.

There are many reports which suggest that the disease can present with gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and loss of appetite, which the gastroenterologists may have to deal with. Hence, knowledge about the diagnosis of COVID-19 is important to gastroenterologists as well. The current review therefore covers the challenges faced while choosing appropriate sample collection, transport, and tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The right sample at the right time from the right anatomical site with the proper precautions is crucial in prompt and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19. The tests can be divided into direct, indirect, and complementary tests. In the direct test, real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays are the molecular tests of choice for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Other direct tests include GeneXpert and TrueNAT. In indirect testing, antigen-antibody-based techniques are recommended for surveillance for the disease, which may help to formulate the control measures. Finally, the additional tests help in assessing the disease severity and evaluating the prognosis. All the above tests are important not only for diagnosis but also for management strategy and prognosis.","Ghoshal, Ujjala; Vasanth, Shruthi; Tejan, Nidhi",Indian J Gastroenterol,661,23

Gastrointestinal manifestations could be the initial presenting manifestation in many patients, especially in children.

Approximately 48.1% of patients had a stool sample that was positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral RNA. Children typically form 1%-8% of all laboratory-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2. Gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19 in children are not rare, with a prevalence between 0 and 88%, and a wide variety of presentations, including diarrhoea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, can develop before, with or after the development of respiratory symptoms. Atypical manifestations such as appendicitis or liver injury could also appear, especially in the presence of multisystem inflammatory disease.

Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) results showed that KD value between DEX and ACE2 was (9.03 ± 0.78) e-6 M. Cell membrane chromatography (CMC) results uncovered that DEX had a chromatographic retention. DEX was found out to inhibiting the viropexis into ACE2h cells using SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped virus.

Mann-Whitney-U-Test and Pearson correlation showed panic is more pronounced in the Korean group while having a similar panic display pattern with the immigrants. The immigrant group appears to highly trust the Korean health system, health institutions, local media, and the local native community. Beyond conventional expectations, participant's average panic score showed a statistically significant positive correlation with items of the trust scale, indicating a level of individual reliance amid the pandemic panic. Thus, ascertaining institutional trust and matured citizenry are identified as factors for effective public health outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: A quasi-experimental, mixed methods approach was used to examine the rates of visit completion as well as the opinions and experiences of participants enrolled in an ongoing clinical trial of smoking cessation who were required to change from in-person clinic visits to remote visits using video or telephone conferencing due to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: For quantitative comparisons, we used a quasi-experimental design, comparing a cohort of participants followed during the pandemic (n=23, COVID-19 cohort) to a comparable cohort of participants followed over a similar time period in the calendar years 2018 and 2019 (n=51, pre-COVID-19 cohort) to examine the rates of completion of scheduled visits and biospecimen collection. For the qualitative component, interviews were conducted with participants who experienced the transition from in-person to remote visits. RESULTS: Participants in the COVID-19 cohort completed an average of 83.6% of remote clinic visits (95% CI 73.1%-91.2%), which was not significantly different than the in-person completion rate of 89.8% in the pre-COVID-19 cohort. Participants in the COVID-19 cohort returned an average of 93.2% (95% CI 83.5%-98.1%) of saliva specimens for remote clinic visits completed, which was not significantly different than the in-person saliva specimen completion rate of 100% in the pre-COVID-19 cohort. Two broad themes emerged from the qualitative data: (1) the benefits of remote visits and (2) the challenges of remote counseling compared to in-person counseling. Despite limited experience with telehealth prior to this transition, most participants expressed a willingness to engage in remote visits in the future. CONCLUSIONS: Even in the context of a rapid transition from in-person to remote visits necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic, rates of visit completion and return of biospecimens remained high. Participants were generally accepting of the transition. Further research is needed to identify the optimal mix of in-person and remote visits beyond the pandemic context and to better understand how these changes may impact study outcomes.

We aimed to investigate the association between age, frailty, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in hospitalized middle-aged and older adults. METHODS: Longitudinal observational study comprising 711 patients aged &#8805;50 years consecutively admitted to a university hospital dedicated to COVID-19 severe cases, between March and May 2020. We reviewed electronic medical records to collect data on demographics, comorbidities, COVID-19 signs/symptoms, and laboratory findings on admission. We defined frailty using the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS=1-9; frail &#8805;5). We also documented in-hospital mortality. We used logistic regressions to explore associations between age, frailty, and COVID-19 signs/symptoms; and between typical symptoms (fever, cough, dyspnea) and mortality. RESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 66±11 years, and 43% were female. Overall, 25% were frail, and 37% died. The most common COVID-19 presentations were dyspnea (79%), cough (74%), and fever (62%), but patients aged &#8805;65 years were less likely to have a co-occurrence of typical symptoms, both in the absence (OR=0.56; 95%CI=0.39-0.79) and in the presence of frailty (OR=0.52; 95%CI=0.34-0.81). In contrast, older age and frailty were associated with unspecific presentations, including functional decline, acute mental change, and hypotension. After adjusting for age, sex, and frailty, reporting fever was associated with lower odds of mortality (OR=0.70; 95%CI=0.50-0.97). CONCLUSIONS: Atypical COVID-19 presentations are common in frail and older hospitalized patients. Providers should be aware of unspecific disease manifestations during the management and follow-up of this population.","Poco, Paula Cristina Eiras; Aliberti, Márlon Juliano Romero; Dias, Murilo Bacchini; Takahashi, Silvia de Fatima; Leonel, Fabio Campos; Altona, Marcelo; Azevedo, Amanda Lagreca Venys; Shin-Ike, Isabela Akie; Garcia, Bianca Aparecida; Sumita, Leticia Harumi; Lima, Lara Mune de Oliveira; Garcez, Flavia Barreto; Avelino Silva, Thiago J","J. gerontol.

Colon is thought to be the first organ suffering from inflammation under HFD conditions due to the pro-inflammatory macrophages infiltration, however, the mechanisms concerning the induction of pro-inflammatory phenotype of colonic macrophages remains unclear. In this study, we show that HFD increased the percentage of gram-positive bacteria, especially genus Clostridium, and resulted in the significant increment of fecal deoxycholic acid (DCA), a gut microbial metabolite produced by bacteria mainly restricted to genus Clostridium. Notably, reducing gram-positive bacteria with vancomycin diminished fecal DCA and profoundly alleviated pro-inflammatory macrophage infiltration in colon, whereas DCA-supplemented feedings to vancomycin-treated mice provoked obvious pro-inflammatory macrophage infiltration and colonic inflammation. Meanwhile, intra-peritoneal administration of DCA also elicited considerable recruitment of macrophages with pro-inflammatory phenotype. Mechanistically, DCA dose-dependently promoted M1 macrophage polarization and pro-inflammatory cytokines production at least partially through toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) transactivated by M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M2-mAchR)/Src pathway. In addition, M2-mAchR mediated increase of TLR2 transcription was mainly achieved via targeting AP-1 transcription factor. Moreover, NF-&#954;B/ERK/JNK signalings downstream of TLR2 are involved in the DCA-induced macrophage polarization. In conclusion, our findings revealed that high level DCA induced by HFD may serve as an initiator to activate macrophages and drive colonic inflammation, thus offer a mechanistic basis that modulation of gut microbiota or intervening specific bile acid receptor signaling could be potential therapeutic approaches for HFD-related inflammatory diseases.","Wang, Lingyu; Gong, Zizhen; Zhang, Xiuyuan; Zhu, Fangxinxing; Liu, Yuchen; Jin, Chaozhi; Du, Xixi; Xu, Congfeng; Chen, Yingwei; Cai, Wei; Tian, Chunyan; Wu, Jin",Gut Microbes,661,24

This is because the immunization system relies on functioning health facilities and stable communities to be effective. Its disruption increases the risk of epidemics of vaccine-preventable diseases, which could increase child mortality. Therefore, policymakers must quickly identify robust and context-specific strategies to rapidly scale-up routine immunization in order to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on their national immunization performance. To achieve this, we propose a paradigm shift towards systems thinking and use of implementation science in immunization decision-making. Systems thinking can inform a more nuanced and holistic understanding of the interrelationship between COVID-19, its control strategies, and childhood immunization. Tools like causal loop diagrams can be used to explicitly illustrate the systems structure by identifying feedback loops. Once mapped and leverage points for interventions have been identified, implementation science can be used to guide the rapid uptake and utilization of multifaceted evidence-based innovations in complex practice settings. As Africa re-strategizes for the post-2020 era, these emerging fields could contribute significantly in accelerating progress towards universal access to vaccines for all children on the continent despite COVID-19.","Adamu, Abdu A; Jalo, Rabiu I; Habonimana, Desire; Wiysonge, Charles S",Int J Infect Dis,661,24

METHODS: This case-control study nested within a cohort of cDMARD users was conducted in the Lombardy, Veneto, Tuscany and Lazio regions and Reggio Emilia province. Claims databases were linked to COVID-19 surveillance registries. Risk of COVID-19-related outcomes was estimated using a multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis, comparing HCQ/CLQ vs methotrexate, vs other cDMARDs and vs non-use of these drugs. Presence of rheumatic diseases vs their absence in a non-nested population was investigated. RESULTS: 1275 cases hospitalized due to COVID-19 were matched to 12 734 controls. Compared with recent use of methotrexate, no association between HCQ/CLQ monotherapy and COVID-19 hospitalization (OR 0.83 [95%CI, 0.69-1.00]) or mortality (OR 1.19 [95%CI, 0.85-1.67]) was observed. A lower risk was found when comparing HCQ/CLQ use to the concomitant use of other cDMARDs and glucocorticoids. HCQ/CLQ was not associated with COVID-19 hospitalization as compared with non-use. An increased risk for recent use of either methotrexate monotherapy (OR 1.19 [95% CI, 1.05-1.34]) or other cDMARDs (OR 1.21 [95% CI, 1.08-1.36]) vs non-use was found. Rheumatic diseases were not associated with COVID-19-related outcomes. CONCLUSION: HCQ/CLQ use in rheumatic patients was not associated with a protective effect against COVID-19-related outcomes. Use of other cDMARDs was associated with an increased risk when compared with non-use, and, if concomitantly used with glucocorticoids, also vs HCQ/CLQ, probably to be ascribed to immunosuppressive action.","Alegiani, Stefania Spila; Crisafulli, Salvatore; Rossi, Paolo Giorgi; Mancuso, Pamela; Salvarani, Carlo; Atzeni, Fabiola; Gini, Rosa; Kirchmayer, Ursula; Belleudi, Valeria; Kurotschka, Peter Konstantin; Leoni, Olivia; Ludergnani, Monica; Ferroni, Eliana; Baracco, Susanna; Massari, Marco; Trifirò, Gianluca",Rheumatology (Oxford),661,24

We have investigated what factors related to the pandemic influenced hospital presentations following self-harm during lockdown in England. METHOD: Mental health clinicians assessing individuals aged 18 years and over presenting to hospitals in Oxford and Derby following self-harm during the period March 23rd to May 17, 2020 recorded whether the self-harm was related to the impact of COVID-19 and, if so, what specific factors were relevant. These factors were organized into a classification scheme. Information was also collected on patients' demographic characteristics, method of self-harm and suicide intent. RESULTS: Of 228 patients assessed, in 46.9% (N = 107) COVID-19 and lockdown restrictions were identified as influencing self-harm. This applied more to females than males (53.5%, N = 68/127 v 38.6%, N = 39/101, &#967;2 = 5.03, p = 0.025), but there were no differences in age, methods of self-harm or suicide intent between the two groups. The most frequent COVID-related factors were mental health issues, including new and worsening disorders, and cessation or reduction of services (including absence of face-to-face support), isolation and loneliness, reduced contact with key individuals, disruption to normal routine, and entrapment. Multiple, often inter-connected COVID-related factors were identified in many patients. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-related factors were identified as influences in nearly half of individuals presenting to hospitals following self-harm in the period following introduction of lockdown restrictions. Females were particularly affected. The fact that mental health problems, including issues with delivery of care, predominated has implications for organisation of services during such periods. The contribution of isolation, loneliness and sense of entrapment highlight the need for relatives, friends and neighbours to be encouraged to reach out to others, especially those living alone. The classification of COVID-related factors can be used as an aide-memoire for clinicians.","Hawton, Keith; Lascelles, Karen; Brand, Fiona; Casey, Deborah; Bale, Liz; Ness, Jennifer; Kelly, Samantha; Waters, Keith",J Psychiatr Res,661,1

While the increase in ethnic minorities is likely to be multifactorial, to date, no studies have looked to see whether values for routine clinical biochemistry parameters differ between ethnic minority and white individuals. METHODS: Baseline biochemical data for 22 common tests from 311 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients presenting to hospital in April 2020 in whom ethnicity data were available was retrospectively collected and evaluated. Data comparisons between ethnic minority and white groups were made for all patient data and for the subset of patients subsequently admitted to intensive care. RESULTS: When all patient data were considered, the ethnic minority population had statistically significant higher concentrations of C reactive protein (CRP), aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase, while troponin T was higher in the white group. A greater proportion of ethnic minority patients were subsequently admitted to intensive care, but when the presenting biochemistry of this subset of patients was compared, no significant differences were observed between ethnic minority and white groups. CONCLUSION: Our data show for the first time that routine biochemistry at hospital presentation in COVID-19 differs between ethnic minority and white groups. Among the markers identified, CRP was significantly higher in the ethnic minority group pointing towards an increased tendency for severe inflammation in this group.","Taylor, David R; Buchanan, Devon; Al-Hasani, Wiaam; Kearney, Jessica; Mazaheri, Tina; Ranasinghe, Ruvini N K; Dimitriadis, Georgios K; Vincent, Royce P",J. clin. pathol,661,24

OBJECTIVE: The objective was to develop a quantitative assay for IgG to SARS-CoV-2 proteins that could be implemented in clinical and research laboratories. METHODS: The biotin-streptavidin technique was used to conjugate SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) or nucleocapsid protein to the solid phase of the ImmunoCAP. Plasma and serum samples from patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (n = 60) and samples from donors banked before the emergence of COVID-19 (n = 109) were used in the assay. SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels were followed longitudinally in a subset of samples and were related to total IgG and IgG to reference antigens using an ImmunoCAP 250 platform. RESULTS: At a cutoff of 2.5 µg/mL, the assay demonstrated sensitivity and specificity exceeding 95% for IgG to both SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Among 36 patients evaluated in a post-hospital follow-up clinic, median levels of IgG to spike-RBD and nucleocapsid were 34.7 µg/mL (IQR 18-52) and 24.5 µg/mL (IQR 9-59), respectively. Among 17 patients with longitudinal samples, there was a wide variation in the magnitude of IgG responses, but generally the response to spike-RBD and to nucleocapsid occurred in parallel, with peak levels approaching 100 µg/mL, or 1% of total IgG. CONCLUSIONS: We have described a quantitative assay to measure IgG to SARS-CoV-2 that could be used in clinical and research laboratories and implemented at scale. The assay can easily be adapted to measure IgG to mutated COVID-19 proteins, has good performance characteristics, and has a readout in standardized units.","Keshavarz, Behnam; Wiencek, Joesph R; Workman, Lisa J; Straesser, Matthew D; Muehling, Lyndsey M; Canderan, Glenda; Drago, Fabrizio; Bonham, Catherine A; Sturek, Jeffrey M; Ramani, Chintan; McNamara, Coleen A; Woodfolk, Judith A; Kadl, Alexandra; Platts-Mills, Thomas A E; Wilson, Jeffrey M",Int Arch Allergy Immunol,661,24

Although nearly two decades have passed since the emergence of pandemics such as SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), no effective drug against the CoV family has yet been approved, so there is a need to find newer therapeutic targets. Currently, simultaneous research across the globe is being performed to discover efficient vaccines or drugs, including both conventional therapies used to treat previous similar diseases and emerging therapies like nanomedicine. Nanomedicine has already proven its value through its application drug delivery and nanosensors in other diseases. Nanomedicine and its components can play an important role in various stages of prevention, diagnosis, treatment, vaccination, and research related to COVID-19. Nano-based antimicrobial technology can be integrated into personal equipment for the greater safety of healthcare workers and people. Various nanomaterials such as quantum dots can be used as biosensors to diagnose COVID-19. Nanotechnology offers benefits from the use of nanosystems, such as liposomes, polymeric and lipid nanoparticles, metallic nanoparticles, and micelles, for drug encapsulation, and facilitates the improvement of pharmacological drug properties. Antiviral functions for nanoparticles can target the binding, entry, replication, and budding of COVID-19. The toxicity-related inorganic nanoparticles are one of the limiting factors of its use that should be further investigated and modified. In this review, we are going to discuss nanomedicine options for COVID-19 management, similar applications for related viral diseases, and their gap of knowledge.","Vahedifard, Farzan; Chakravarthy, Krishnan",Emergent Mater,661,16

The most affected nations tend to produce the greatest number of coronavirus articles, with output closely coupled to the rate of infection. COVID-19 research has fewer nations and smaller teams than pre-COVID research, a trend which intensifies throughout the pandemic. The United States remains the single largest contributor to the global publication output, but contrary to China's dominance in the initial months of the pandemic, China's contribution falls as the national COVID-19 caseload drops. China-USA collaborations drop as the pandemic continues, perhaps due to China's reduced rate of publication on the topic, and perhaps due to political obstacles, or a combination of these factors.","Cai, X; Fry, C V; Wagner, C S",Scientometrics,661,1

Symptoms of COVID-19 vary widely and range from asymptomatic disease to severe pneumonia and multiorgan failure (2). A severe disease course is more likely in older patients and patients with pre-existing respiratory and cardiovascular conditions (2). Patients with severe Sars-CoV-2 infection may present with ischaemic stroke (3, 4) or even fatal intracerebral haemorrhage (5). To date, little is known about the neuropathological sequelae of COVID-19. The largest published autopsy series of COVID-19 neuropathology reported microthrombi and acute haemorrhagic infarction in a significant number of patients (6), while another more recent study found evidence of lymphocytic encephalitis and meningitis (7). Endotheliitis of the brain and extraneural organs has been shown in Sars-CoV infected patients (8). Similarly, it is a recurrent feature in the lungs and other peripheral organs of Sars-CoV-2 infected patients (9) but has not yet been reported in the central nervous system.

Of course, the prescription of chiral drugs (chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine) has been proved wrong because these chiral drugs neither kill the virus nor eliminate it from the body, but block SARS-CoV-2 from binding to human cells. Another hurdle facing the world is not only the positive test of the patient recovered from coronavirus, but also the second wave of Covid-19. Hence, the world demands such a drug or drug combination which not only prevents the entry of SARS-CoV-2 in the human cell but also ejects it or its material from the body completely. The current computational study not only utilizes a structure-based drug design approach to find possible drug candidates but also explains (i) why the prescription of chiral drugs was not satisfactory, (ii) what types of modification can make their prescription satisfactory, (iii) the mechanism of action of chiral drugs (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine) to block SARS-CoV-2 from binding to human cells, and (iv) the strength of mefloquine to eliminate SARS-CoV-2. As the main protease (M p r o ) of microbes is considered as an effective target for drug design and development, the binding affinities of mefloquine with the M p r o of JC virus and SARS-CoV-2 were calculated, and then compared to know the eliminating strength of mefloquine against SARS-CoV-2. The M p r o of JC virus was taken because mefloquine has already shown a tremendous result of eliminating it from the body. The prescription of a combination of S- (+) -hydroxychloroquine and (+) -mefloquine is considered as a boon by the predicted study. The world is asking for the solution to the upcoming waves of the coronavirus pandemic. The current computational and literature-based prediction expresses the reason for the upcoming waves, and the resolution of it also. Hence, the presented evaluation may play an important role in the current epidemic situation.

METHODS: A prospective cohort study of adult patients who had recovered from COVID-19 (27th February to 29th April 2020) confirmed by PCR or subsequent seroconversion, with a systematic assessment 10-14 weeks after disease onset. PCS was defined as the persistence of at least one clinically relevant symptom, or abnormalities in spirometry or chest radiology. Outcome predictors were analyzed by multiple logistic regression (OR; 95%CI). RESULTS: Two hundred seventy seven patients recovered from mild (34.3%) or severe (65.7%) forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection were evaluated 77 days (IQR 72-85) after disease onset. PCS was detected in 141 patients (50.9%; 95%CI 45.0-56.7%). Symptoms were mostly mild. Alterations in spirometry were noted in 25/269 (9.3%), while in radiographs in 51/277 (18.9%). No baseline clinical features behaved as independent predictors of PCS development. CONCLUSIONS: A Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome was detected in a half of COVID19 survivors.

We carried out the present study to delineate the roles of these biomarkers in various strata of patients with coronavirus infection. Materials & methods: A retrospective study was carried out after obtaining approval from the relevant Ethics Committee. Patients established with COVID-19 infection as shown by positive real-time quantitative PCR test were included. Details on their demographics, diagnosis, whether they received tocilizumab, and the values of the following biomarkers were obtained: IL-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), serum ferritin, D-dimer, procalcitonin, fibrinogen, lactate dehydrogenase and creatinine kinase. Receiver operating characteristic curves were plotted and correlation of biomarkers with IL-6 were estimated. Results: One-hundred and three patients were recruited. We observed that serum ferritin followed by D-dimer had better predictive accuracy in identifying patients with pneumonia compared with asymptomatic; and CRP in addition to the earlier markers had better accuracy for predicting severe illness compared with mild-moderate. Serum IL-6 levels were significantly higher in patients with severe illness admitted in intensive care unit. Significantly, higher levels of IL-6 and serum ferritin were observed in patients receiving tocilizumab. A trend of increased IL-6 levels was observed immediately following the initiation of tocilizumab therapy followed by a drop thereafter. Conclusion: We observed serum ferritin, D-dimer and CRP to accurately predict patients developing severe COVID-19 infections as well as those at risk of developing COVID pneumonia. A trend in IL-6 levels was observed in patients on tocilizumab therapy.","Farid, Eman; Sridharan, Kannan; Alsegai, Ola Am; Khawaja, Safa Al; Mansoor, Eman J; Teraifi, Noor A; Qahtani, Manaf Al; Salman, Jameela Al",Biomark Med,661,1

The objective of this study is to compare results with statistical samples involving millions of people in the two largest neighboring states in Brazil, Amazonas and Pará, which in the first wave were similar but now show significant different results in combating COVID-19. During the first wave, in May 2020, the maximums of the 7-day average daily deaths per population of Amazonas and Pará were similar: 15.7 and 17.1 deaths per day per million people, respectively, which means a ratio 15.7/17.1 = 0.92 &#8776; 1. Now, in the second wave of COVID-19 outbreak, Amazonas has entered a serious situation; meanwhile, Pará has presented a much smaller growth in the mortality. The accumulated mortality per population from 11 November 2020 to 15 March 2021 of Amazonas and Pará are 1645 and 296 deaths per million people, respectively. As 1645/296 = 5.55, Amazonas is presenting an accumulated mortality per population more than five times that of Pará. Future in-depth research can provide a grounded answer to explain this significant difference, nonetheless the explicit support of the Pará state government, after 21 May 2020, to early ambulatory treatment may have played some role on this result.","Emmerich, Francisco G",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),661,21

Objective: To measure the amount of medical debt nationally and by geographic region and income group and its association with Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. Design, Setting, and Participants: Data on medical debt in collections were obtained from a nationally representative 10% panel of consumer credit reports between January 2009 and June 2020 (reflecting care provided prior to the COVID-19 pandemic). Income data were obtained from the 2014-2018 American Community Survey. The sample consisted of 4.1 billion person-month observations (nearly 40 million unique individuals). These data were used to estimate the amount of medical debt (nationally and by geographic region and zip code income decile) and to examine the association between Medicaid expansion and medical debt (overall and by income group). Exposures: Geographic region (US Census region), income group (zip code income decile), and state Medicaid expansion status. Main Outcomes and Measures: The stock (all unpaid debt listed on credit reports) and flow (new debt listed on credit reports during the preceding 12 months) of medical debt in collections that can be collected on by debt collectors. Results: In June 2020, an estimated 17.8% of individuals had medical debt (13.0% accrued debt during the prior year), and the mean amount was $429 ($311 accrued during the prior year). The mean stock of medical debt was highest in the South and lowest in the Northeast ($616 vs $167; difference, $448 [95% CI, $435-$462]) and higher in poor than in rich zip code income deciles ($677 vs $126; difference, $551 [95% CI, $520-$581]). Between 2013 and 2020, the states that expanded Medicaid in 2014 experienced a decline in the mean flow of medical debt that was 34.0 percentage points (95% CI, 18.5-49.4 percentage points) greater (from $330 to $175) than the states that did not expand Medicaid (from $613 to $550). In the expansion states, the gap in the mean flow of medical debt between the lowest and highest zip code income deciles decreased by $145 (95% CI, $95-$194) while the gap increased by $218 (95% CI, $163-$273) in the nonexpansion states. Conclusions and Relevance: This study provides an estimate of the amount of medical debt in collections in the US based on consumer credit reports from January 2009 to June 2020, reflecting care delivered prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and suggests that the amount of medical debt was highest among individuals living in the South and in lower-income communities.

Rapid progress has been made in addressing the situation, and various clinical diagnostic methods were developed for early detection of transmission. However, with a rapidly increasing number of infected populations worldwide, the testing of each individual was impractical. The wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has been implemented to evaluate disease outbreaks as an early warning system for pandemic preparedness. Numerous studies reported the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the open drains and STPs across the globe via recovery efficiency of surrogate virus from existing virus concentration protocols. However, the such reported studies did not justify the use of WBE to identify or pinpoint the specific hotspots of transmission which could be prioritized for rapid efforts to contain or accelerate active vaccination efforts. Identifying precise locations of hotspots could be an essential aspect in controlling the outbreak and surge of wave by prioritizing the region for primary outbreak response. This article focuses on the issues relating to the primary focus for WBE that can be adapted, and its suitability for utilization in the mass vaccination program is discussed. Effective use of WBE information in terms of source tracking might be crucial as we move towards mass vaccination to control outbreaks of COVID-19 pandemic.","Tanmay, Dharmadhikari Rakeshkumar Yadav Syed Dastager Mahesh Dharne",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,661,16

Healing thermal waters are not only used there for medical treatments, because they also supply the brine graduation towers, are the base for the production of cosmetics and are also used in drinking treatments. Uniejow spa is a part of the cascade system, so the healing waters of higher temperature are also used for heating apartments.

Herein, we characterized the site-specific N-glycosylation of S protein at the level of intact glycopeptides. All 22 potential N-glycosites were identified in the S-protein protomer and were found to be preserved among the 753 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences. The glycosites exhibited glycoform heterogeneity as expected for a human cell-expressed protein subunit. We identified masses that correspond to 157 N-glycans, primarily of the complex type. In contrast, the insect cell-expressed S protein contained 38 N-glycans, completely of the high-mannose type. Our results revealed that the glycan types were highly determined by the differential processing of N-glycans among human and insect cells, regardless of the glycosites' location. Moreover, the N-glycan compositions were conserved among different sizes of subunits. Our study indicate that the S protein N-glycosylation occurs regularly at each site, albeit the occupied N-glycans were diverse and heterogenous. This N-glycosylation landscape and the differential N-glycan patterns among distinct host cells are expected to shed light on the infection mechanism and present a positive view for the development of vaccines and targeted drugs.","Zhang, Yong; Zhao, Wanjun; Mao, Yonghong; Chen, Yaohui; Wang, Shisheng; Zhong, Yi; Su, Tao; Gong, Meng; Du, Dan; Lu, Xiaofeng; Cheng, Jingqiu; Yang, Hao",Mol. cell. proteomics,661,1

COVID-19 pandemic especially has created unforeseen public health challenges including a global shortage of PPE needed for the safety of health care workers (HCWs). Although sufficient stocks of PPE are currently available, their critical shortage may develop soon due to increase in demand and depletion of existing supply lines. To empower our HCWs and ensure their continued protection, proactive measures are urgently required to develop procedures to safely decontaminate the PPEs to allow their ""selective reuse"" during contingency situations. Methods: Herein, we have successfully developed a decontamination method based on vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP). We have used a range of concentration of hydrogen peroxide to disinfect PPE (coveralls, face-shields, and N-95 masks). To ensure a proper disinfection, we have evaluated three biological indicators namely Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium smegmatis and spores of Bacillus stearothermophilus, considered as the gold standard for disinfection processes. We next evaluated the impact of repeated VHP treatment on physical features, permeability, and fabric integrity of coveralls and N-95 masks. Next, we performed Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) to evaluate microscopic changes in fiber thickness of N-95 masks, melt blown layer or coverall body suits. Considering the fact that any disinfection procedure should be able to meet local requirements, our study included various regionally procured N-95 masks and coveralls available at our institute All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India. Lastly, the practical utility of VHP method developed herein was ascertained by operationalizing a dedicated research facility disinfecting used PPE during COVID-19. Results: Our prototype studies show that a single VHP cycle (7-8% Hydrogen peroxide) could disinfect PPE and PPE housing room of about 1200 cubic feet (length10 ft × breadth 10 ft × height 12 ft) in less than 10 min, as noted by a complete loss of B. stearothermophilus spore revival. The results are consistent and reproducible as tested in over 10 cycles in our settings. Further, repeated VHP treatment did not result in any physical tear, deformity or other appreciable change in the coverall and N-95 masks. Our permeation tests evaluating droplet penetration did not reveal any change in permeability post-VHP treatments. Also, SEM analysis indeed revealed no significant change in fiber thickness or damage to fibers of coveralls or melt blown layer of N-95 masks essential for filtration. There was no change in user comfort and experience following VHP treatment of PPE. Based on results of these studies, and parameters developed and optimized, an institutional research facility to disinfect COVID-19 PPE is successfully established and operationalized with more than 80% recovery rate for used PPE post-disinfection. Conclusions: Our study, therefore, successfully establishes the utility of VHP to effectively disinfect PPE for a possible reuse as per the requirements. VHP treatment did not damage coveralls, cause physical deformity and also did not alter fabric architecture of melt blown layer. We observed that disinfection process was successful consistently and therefore believe that the VHP-based decontamination model will have a universal applicability and utility. This proces2s can be easily and economically scaled up and can be instrumental in easing global PPE shortages in any biosafety facility or in health care settings during pandemic situation such as COVID-19.","Saini, Vikram; Sikri, Kriti; Batra, Sakshi Dhingra; Kalra, Priya; Gautam, Kamini",Gut Pathogens,661,24

Nearly one-third of the adult population is hypertensive worldwide, it is urgent to identify the factors that determine the clinical course and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with hypertension. METHODS AND RESULTS: 148 COVID-19 patients with pre-existing hypertension with clarified outcomes (discharge or deceased) from a national cohort in China were included in this study, of whom 103 were discharged and 45 died in hospital. Multivariate regression showed higher odds of in-hospital death associated with high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) > 28 pg/ml (hazard ratio [HR]: 3.27, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.55-6.91) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) > 7 pg/ml (HR: 3.63, 95% CI:1.54-8.55) at admission. Patients with uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) (n = 52) which were defined as systolic BP &#8805;140 mm Hg or diastolic BP &#8805;90 mm Hg for more than once (&#8805;2 times) during hospitalization, were more likely to have ICU admission (p = 0.037), invasive mechanical ventilation (p = 0.028), and renal injury (p = 0.005). A stricter BP control with the threshold of 130/80 mm Hg was associated with lower mortality. Treatment with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) suppressors, including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), and spironolactone, was associated with a lower rate of ICU admission compared to other types of anti-hypertensive medications (8 (22.9%) vs. 25 (43.1%), p = 0.048). CONCLUSION: Among COVID-19 patients with pre-existing hypertension, elevated hs-cTn and IL-6 could help clinicians to identify patients with fatal outcomes at an early stage, blood pressure control is associated with better clinical outcomes, and RAAS suppressors do not increase mortality and may decrease the need for ICU admission.","Wang, Tao; Tang, Ruidi; Ruan, Honglian; Chen, Ruchong; Zhang, Zili; Sang, Ling; Su, Xi; Yi, Shuting; Ni, Zhengyi; Hu, Yu; Liu, Lei; Shan, Hong; Lei, Chunliang; Peng, Yixiang; Liu, Chunli; Li, Jing; Hong, Cheng; Zhang, Nuofu; Zhong, Nanshan; Li, Shiyue",The clinical respiratory journal (Online),661,26

Non-pharmacological public health interventions are the only mode to control diseases in the absence of medication. Objective To find the impact of public health interventions on the epidemiological indicators of disease progression. Methods This is a secondary data analysis done on COVID-19 data. The median doubling time and R0 were calculated for a rolling period of seven days. Interventions were scored from zero to three with an increasing level of stringency. Multivariate linear regression was performed to find the role of individual interventions on R0 and the median doubling time. Results The highest intervention score was reported in the lockdown phase, which gradually decreased to the lowest level of 22. The R0 values settled to a level of 1.25, and the median doubling time increased to 20 days at the end of the study. Public awareness and public health laws were found to be related to both R0 and the median doubling time in the pre-lockdown phase only. Conclusion The implementation of interventions at the ground level is one of the key factors in the success of public health interventions. Post implementation, poor effectiveness of many interventions is evident from the study. Further, studies related to the sequence of interventions are required to further analyze the poor effect of the interventions.","Kharya, P.; Koparkar, A. R.; Dixit, A. M.; Joshi, H. S.; Rath, R.

Pregnant women and children are particularly vulnerable during disasters and emergencies. Comprehensive and applicable emergency preparedness and response are definitely important methods to prevent and contain the COVID-19 pandemic. The rational allocation of pharmaceutical resources plays an important role in the medical emergency plan. This paper aimed to share experiences for the allocation of pharmaceutical resources in hospitals focusing primarily on women and children during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Cai, Jianghui; Chen, Wenwen; Yang, Xiao; Yang, Xiuqing; Li, Gen",Rev Assoc Med Bras (1992),661,1

Abnormal deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins is a key factor in the development of tissue remodelling that results in symptoms and impaired lung function in these diseases. Tissue remodelling in the lungs is complex and differs between compartments. Some pathways are common but tissue remodelling around the airways and in the parenchyma have different morphologies. Hence it is critical to evaluate both common fibrotic pathways and those that are specific to different compartments; thereby expanding the understanding of the pathogenesis of fibrosis and remodelling in the airways and parenchyma in asthma, COPD and IPF with a view to developing therapeutic strategies for each. Here we review the current understanding of remodelling features and underlying mechanisms in these major respiratory diseases. The differences and similarities of remodelling are used to highlight potential common therapeutic targets and strategies. One central pathway in remodelling processes involves transforming growth factor (TGF)-ß induced fibroblast activation and myofibroblast differentiation that increases ECM production. The current treatments and clinical trials targeting remodelling are described, as well as potential future directions. These endeavours are indicative of the renewed effort and optimism for drug discovery targeting tissue remodelling and fibrosis.","Liu, Gang; Philp, Ashleigh M; Corte, Tamera; Travis, Mark A; Schilter, Heidi; Hansbro, Nicole G; Burns, Chris J; Eapen, Mathew S; Sohal, Sukhwinder S; Burgess, Janette K; Hansbro, Philip M",Pharmacol Ther,661,1

The main challenge of this disease is the primary diagnosis to prevent secondary infections and its spread from one person to another. Therefore, it is essential to use an automatic diagnosis system along with clinical procedures for the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 to prevent its spread. Artificial intelligence techniques using computed tomography (CT) images of the lungs and chest radiography have the potential to obtain high diagnostic performance for Covid-19 diagnosis. In this study, a fusion of convolutional neural network (CNN), support vector machine (SVM), and Sobel filter is proposed to detect COVID-19 using X-ray images. A new X-ray image dataset was collected and subjected to high pass filter using a Sobel filter to obtain the edges of the images. Then these images are fed to CNN deep learning model followed by SVM classifier with ten-fold cross validation strategy. This method is designed so that it can learn with not many data. Our results show that the proposed CNN-SVM with Sobel filtering (CNN-SVM+Sobel) achieved the highest classification accuracy of 99.02% in accurate detection of COVID-19. It showed that using Sobel filter can improve the performance of CNN. Unlike most of the other researches, this method does not use a pre-trained network. We have also validated our developed model using six public databases and obtained the highest performance.

Due to the contagious nature of SARS-CoV-2 and its suspected presence in middle ear mucosa and mastoid, Ear surgeons are bound to face a challenging situation in present times as well as in times to come. Through this article we aim to streamline fresh management strategies particularly for the post-lockdown period keeping in mind that immunity after vaccination may take a few months to develop due to various factors discussed in the article. The ENT Cochrane, Pubmed and Web of Science databases were searched extensively using the terms 'Covid-19 and SARS-CoV-2 in conjunction with Ear surgery and Otology. Data collected from these, put together with our experience helped us in putting forward fresh management strategies to deal with the current situation being experienced worldwide. To reduce the risk of infection to the healthcare staff, we have suggested a new triage strategy for ear surgeries to reduce the accumulated disease burden in the post-lockdown period until immunity by vaccination develops amongst a good number of Ear surgeons. Also we have put forward certain operating guidelines that might prove helpful for the Ear surgeon during these times. Fresh Triage guidelines mentioned in this article are particularly meant to help ear surgeons reduce the accumulated disease burden in the post lockdown-period with ease and efficacy. Since ear surgery poses a risk of infection to the healthcare workers, specific guidelines pertaining to ear surgery during the pandemic are mentioned in detail which in our opinion can be of immense help to all the healthcare professionals involved in ear procedures till the time the vaccine is administered on a large scale.","Bhardwaj, Rohit; Sharma, Akriti; Singhal, Bhumika",Indian J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,661,13

One challenge is that health care professionals are at high risk of infection themselves. Therefore, in-person visits need to be reduced to an absolute minimum. Connected care solutions, including telehealth, remote patient monitoring, and secure communications between clinicians and their patients, may rapidly become the first choice in such public health emergencies. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the COVID-19 Caregiver Cockpit (C19CC) was to implement a free-of-charge, web- and app-based tool for patient assessment to assist health care professionals working in the COVID-19 environment. METHODS: Physicians in Argentina, Germany, Iran, Italy, Portugal, Switzerland, and the United States explained their challenges with COVID-19 patient care through unstructured interviews. Based on the collected feedback, the first version of the C19CC was built. In the second round of interviews, the application was presented to physicians, and more feedback was obtained. RESULTS: Physicians identified a number of different scenarios where telemedicine or connected care solutions could rapidly improve patient care. These scenarios included outpatient care, discharge management, remote tracking of patients with chronic diseases, as well as incorporating infected physicians under quarantine into telehealth services. CONCLUSIONS: The C19CC is the result of an agile and iterative development process that complements the work of physicians. It aims to improve the care and safety of people who are infected by COVID-19.","Schinköthe, Timo; Gabri, Mariano Rolando; Mitterer, Manfred; Gouveia, Pedro; Heinemann, Volker; Harbeck, Nadia; Subklewe, Marion",JMIR Public Health Surveill,661,23

However, the evidence surrounding risk factors for IPJ osteoarthritis progression is unclear. Identifying risk factors for IPJ osteoarthritis progression may inform preventative strategies and early interventions to improve long-term outcomes for individuals at risk of IPJ osteoarthritis progression. The objectives of the study were to describe methods used to measure the progression of IPJ osteoarthritis and identify risk factors for IPJ osteoarthritis progression. MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, and The Cochrane Library were searched from inception to 19th February 2020 (PROSPERO CRD42019121034). Eligible studies assessed potential risk factor/s associated with IPJ osteoarthritis progression. Risk of bias was assessed using a modified QUIPS Tool, and a best evidence synthesis was performed. Of eight eligible studies, all measured osteoarthritis progression radiographically, and none considered symptoms. Eighteen potential risk factors were assessed. Diabetes (adjusted mean difference between 2.06 and 7.78), and larger finger epiphyseal index in males (regression coefficient ß = 0.202) and females (ß = 0.325) were identified as risk factors (limited evidence). Older age in men and women showed mixed results; 13 variables were not risk factors (all limited evidence). Patients with diabetes and larger finger epiphyseal index might be at higher risk of radiographic IPJ osteoarthritis progression, though evidence is limited and studies are biased. Studies assessing symptomatic IPJ osteoarthritis progression are lacking.","Shah, Karishma; Yang, Xiaotian; Lane, Jennifer C E; Collins, Gary S; Arden, Nigel K; Furniss, Dominic; Filbay, Stephanie R",Rheumatol.Int,661,1

There is much speculation about the interplay between ACEI/ARB and Corona virus infection, as for internalization into host cell SARS-COV-2 binds through S spike protein to ACE-2, aided TMPRSS2. METHODS: A record based observational study has been conducted (data obtained from the clinics of fourteen physicians) in two worst affected districts of West Bengal, to find out the association of ACEI/ARB on patients, suffering from Corona virus infection. The study-protocol has already been approved by Clinical Research Ethics Committee of Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine. (IEC Ref.

Tumors can constitute a contraindication for transplantation or can lead to a delay of acceptance to the waiting-list. Current waiting time guidelines mainly refer to early data collected nearly 30 years ago, when the knowledge on tumors was, by current standards, still limited. RECENT FINDINGS: Today, cancers can usually be divided into many different biological subtypes, according to histological and molecular subclassification and the availability of genetic testing. A more precise stratification and targeted antitumor therapies have led to better therapy outcomes or even cures from certain malignancies and to a better appreciation of tumor risks for the patient. SUMMARY: Even though transplant patients do have an increased risk for malignancies, it is often overlooked that patients, while on dialysis, are equally prone to develop a tumor. Competing risks (e.g. cardiovascular, mortality risks) through prolonged time on dialysis have to be equally considered, when the decision for acceptance of a patient to the waiting-list is made. Current waiting time suggestions should be critically reconsidered for every patient after a thorough discussion with an oncologist, including new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, as well as novel risk stratifications.","Bojic, Marija; Watschinger, Clara; Reiter, Thomas; Watschinger, Bruno",Curr Opin Nephrol Hypertens,661,21

Design/methodology/approach: The study employs the human capital approach to estimate the DMVHL (assuming Spain's life expectancy of 83 years and a 3% discount rate) of the 20,453 human lives lost in Spain from COVID-19 as of 19 April 2020. Sensitivity analysis was conducted alternately assuming (a) 5% and 10% discount rate; and (b) global life expectancy of 72 years, and the world's highest life expectancy of 87.1 years. Findings: The 20,453 human lives lost due to COVID-19 had a total DMVHL of Int$ 9,629,234,112, and an average of Int$ 470,798 per human life lost. Alternate re-estimation of the economic model with a 5% and 10% discount rates led to 19.8% and 47.4% reductions in the DMVHL, respectively. Re-calculation of the economic model using the global life expectancy of 72 years, while holding the discount rate constant at 3%, diminished the DMVHL by 41%. While the re-run of the same model using the world's highest life expectancy of 87.1 years instead, it increased the DMVHL by 18%. Research limitations/implications: The study omits the value of health systems inputs used in preventing, diagnosing and treating COVID-19 cases; and the negative impact of COVID-19 on the agriculture, education, finance, manufacturing, travel, tourism, and trade sectors. Social implications: There is a need to use this kind of evidence to advocate for increased investments into the strengthening of the national health system, IHR capacities, and coverage of safe water and sanitation facilities. Originality/value: In Spain, no other study had attempted to estimate the net present value of human lives lost from COVID-19.","Kirigia, Joses Muthuri; Muthuri, Rose Nabi Deborah Karimi",J.

However, pandemic-related policy decisions cannot be made on health information alone but need to take into account the broader impacts on people and their needs. Quantifying human needs across the population is challenging as it requires high geo-temporal granularity, high coverage across the population, and appropriate adjustment for seasonal and other external effects. Here, we propose a computational framework, based on Maslow's hierarchy of needs, that can characterize a holistic view of relative changes in needs following the pandemic through a difference-in-differences approach that corrects for seasonality and query volume variations. We apply this framework to characterize changes in human needs across physiological, socioeconomic, and psychological realms in the US, based on more than 35 billion search interactions spanning over 36,000 ZIP codes over a period of 14 months. Our analyses reveal that the expression of basic human needs has increased exponentially while higher-level aspirations declined during the pandemic in comparison to the pre-pandemic period. In exploring the timing and variations in statewide policies, we find that the duration of shelter-in-place mandates significantly influenced social and emotional needs. We demonstrate that potential barriers to addressing critical needs such as support for unemployment and domestic violence can be identified through web search interactions. Our approach and results suggest that population-scale monitoring of shifts in human needs can inform policies and recovery efforts for current and anticipated needs.","Suh, Jina; Horvitz, Eric; White, Ryen W.; Althoff, Tim",,661,16

Data on the prevalence and degree of COVID-19 associated liver injury among patients with COVID-19 remain limited. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the prevalence and degree of liver injury between patients with severe and non-severe COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a systematic search of three electronic databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Library), from inception to 24th April 2020. We included all adult human studies (>20 subjects) regardless of language, region or publication date or status. We assessed the pooled odds ratio (OR), mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) using the random-effects model. RESULTS: Among 1543 citations, there were 24 studies (5961 subjects) which fulfilled our inclusion criteria. The pooled odds ratio for elevated ALT (ORâ¯=â¯2.5, 95%CI: 1.6-3.7, I2â¯=â¯57%), AST (ORâ¯=â¯3.4, 95%CI: 2.3-5.0, I2â¯=â¯56%), hyperbilirubinemia (ORâ¯=â¯1.7, 95%CI: 1.2-2.5, I2â¯=â¯0%) and hypoalbuminemia (ORâ¯=â¯7.1, 95%CI: 2.1-24.1, I2â¯=â¯71%) were higher subjects in critical COVID-19. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 associated liver injury is more common in severe COVID-19 than non-severe COVID-19.

Poor cyber-hygiene among internet users is a very critical issue undermining the general acceptance and adoption of internet technology. It has become a global issue and concern in this digital era when virtually all business transactions, learning, communication and many other activities are performed online. Virus attack, poor authentication technique, improper file backups and the use of different social engineering approaches by cyber-attackers to deceive internet users into divulging their confidential information with the intention to attack them have serious negative implications on the industries and organisations, including educational institutions. Moreover, risks associated with these ugly phenomena are likely to be more in developing countries such as Nigeria.

However, while Ebola public opinion remained partisan, ultimately, opinion emerged of a bipartisan nature for Zika, mirroring elite framing. Public health officials should be aware of how elite cueing shapes policy and prioritizes partisan strategies. Politics and public opinion can focus attention on or away from infectious disease; it can also undermine public health responses by biasing the public's view of a diseases' relative risk.","Singer, Phillip M; Willison, Charley E; Greer, Scott L",J. public health policy,661,1

The direct risk to the health of children is low. However, disease-containment measures have society-wide impacts. This study explored the pandemic experiences of parents of children with oesophageal atresia/tracheo-oesophageal fistula (OA/TOF) in the UK. Design A phenomenological approach underpinned use of an asynchronous online forum method, in collaboration with a patient support group. Data were evaluated using thematic analysis. Results The online forum ran between 7 November and 18 December 2020 with 109 participants. Pandemic experiences were divided into themes relating to healthcare and disease containment. Participants described positive experiences with remote healthcare but identified limitations. Delays and cancellations led to escalation of care to an emergency level, slower developmental progress and feelings of being abandoned by services. Inpatient care was perceived as safe but caring alone was emotionally and practically challenging. Disease containment themes revealed anxiety regarding health risks, 'collateral' damage to well-being because of isolation, and an impact on finances and employment. Parents described a transition from worry about direct health risks to concern about the impact of isolation on socialisation and development. A process of risk-benefit analysis led some to transition to a more 'normal life', while others continued to isolate. Benefits to their child's health from isolation were reported. Conclusions Parents' experiences of caring for a child with OA/TOF during the pandemic were varied. Rapid adoption of telehealth has demonstrated the enormous potential of remote healthcare delivery but requires refinement to meet the needs of the individual. Future pandemic planning should aim to retain community healthcare services to avoid escalation of care to an emergency, manage chronic and developmental concerns, and support parental well-being. Accurate and consistent disease-specific information is highly valued by parents. Third sector organisations are ideally positioned to support this. © 2021 BMJ Publishing Group.

It has also been a catalyst to serious debate in the “tourism academy,” as revealed by a discussion on TRINET Tourism Information Network via email in May 2020. The catalyst to this debate was an email by academic Jim Butcher announcing his work entitled “the war on tourism,” published in an online magazine. Presenting a binary between industry recovery and reform, Butcher’s article denounced a body of tourism work he portrayed as hostile to the industry and as using COVID-19 as an opportunity to attack it. He argued that this resulted in harm to tourism businesses, tourism workers and ordinary tourists. These TRINET discussions worked to present a binary in schools of thought, divided by being either for the tourism industry or against it. This analysis explains how advocates of industry rapid recovery stand opposed to wider efforts to reform tourism to be more ethical, responsible and sustainable. The struggle concerns both the proper role of tourism and tourism academics. Outcomes from this debate have repercussions for the development of the discipline, the education of tourism students and the future of tourism practices.","Higgins-Desbiolles, Freya",J.

T cell responses to viruses can be corrected by adoptive cellular therapy using donor-derived virus-specific T cells. One approach is the establishment of banks of HLA-typed virus-specific T cells for rapid deployment to patients. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2-exposed blood donations contain CD4 and CD8 memory T cells which recognize SARS-CoV-2 spike, nucleocapsid and membrane antigens. Peptides of these antigens can be used to isolate virus-specific T cells in a GMP-compliant process. The isolated T cells can be rapidly expanded using GMP-compliant reagents for use as an allogeneic therapy. Memory and effector phenotypes are present in the selected virus-specific T cells, but our method rapidly expands the desirable central memory phenotype. A manufacturing yield ranging from 1010 to 1011 T cells can be obtained within 21 days culture. Thus, multiple therapeutic doses of virus-specific T cells can be rapidly generated from convalescent donors for potential treatment of COVID-19 patients.","Cooper, Rachel S; Fraser, Alasdair R; Smith, Linda; Burgoyne, Paul; Imlach, Stuart N; Jarvis, Lisa M; Turner, David M; Zahra, Sharon; Turner, Marc L; Campbell, John D M",Front Immunol,661,20

Predictions must take into account non-pharmaceutical interventions to slow the spread of coronavirus, including stay-at-home orders, social distancing, quarantine and compulsory mask-wearing, leading to reductions in intra-city mobility and viral transmission. Moreover, recent work associating coronavirus with human mobility and detailed movement data suggest the need to consider urban mobility in disease forecasts. Here we show that by incorporating intra-city mobility and policy adoption into a novel metapopulation SEIR model, we can accurately predict complex COVID-19 growth patterns in U.S. cities ($R^2$ = 0.990). Estimated mobility change due to policy interventions is consistent with empirical observation from Apple Mobility Trends Reports (Pearson's R = 0.872), suggesting the utility of model-based predictions where data are limited. Our model also reproduces urban""superspreading"", where a few neighborhoods account for most secondary infections across urban space, arising from uneven neighborhood populations and heightened intra-city churn in popular neighborhoods. Therefore, our model can facilitate location-aware mobility reduction policy that more effectively mitigates disease transmission at similar social cost. Finally, we demonstrate our model can serve as a fine-grained analytic and simulation framework that informs the design of rational non-pharmaceutical interventions policies.","Han, Zhenyu; Xu, Fengli; Li, Yong; Jiang, Tao; Jin, Depeng; Lu, Jianhua; Evans, James A.",,661,33

This study aims to analyse the extent to which potential risk and protective factors against burnout have affected nursing home workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and to assess the contribution of these factors to their burnout. Three hundred forty professionals who worked in nursing homes in Spain completed a survey and reported on their sociodemographic characteristics and their organisational characteristics of the job related to COVID-19, SOC and burnout. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed. The results showed that the SOC is highly related to the dimensions of burnout and is a protective factor against this. In addition, the increase in hours has a negative effect, facilitating inadequate responses to stressful situations; and whereas perceived social support and availability of resources have a protective effect, the deterioration in mental and physical health is the most important risk factor. This study could help better understand the psychological consequences of the effort that nursing home workers and can also help design mental health prevention and care interventions for workers that provide them with resources and supports that foster their coping skills.","Navarro Prados, Ana Belén; Jiménez García-Tizón, Sara; Meléndez, Juan Carlos",Heal. soc. care community,661,25

A total of 44 questions were answered in four main sections: 1. general technical components; 2. acceptance; 3. evaluation and functionality; and 4. overall evaluation and grades of the various digital concepts. The use of Zoom conference, livestream, and prerecorded PowerPoint was compared to the conventional lecture setup (control group/CG). Data were analyzed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, followed by an exploratory data analysis and Cronbach's alpha test (&#945; = 0.05). RESULTS: Students were very satisfied with the provision, quality, and benefit of the digital concepts. The asynchronous concept was significantly more satisfying than the synchronous concepts in many aspects but was less successful in interactions. In the overall evaluation and grading, the asynchronous concept was rated significantly better than the other synchronous concepts (p &#8804; 0.007), followed by Zoom conference, conventional lecture (CG), and livestream, while Zoom conference and the conventional lecture showed no significant difference (p = 0.784). CONCLUSIONS: Students significantly preferred the asynchronous concept to the synchronous concepts.

RESULTS: The top 10 upregulated circRNAs in CD compared with HC were hsa_circ_0000691, hsa_circ_0001666, hsa_circ_0004183, hsa_circ_0009024, hsa_circ RNA_405324, hsa_circ_0002003, hsa_circ_0085323, hsa_circ_0040994, hsa_circ_0062142, and hsa_circ_0048148; the top 10 downregulated circRNAs were hsa_circ_0049356, hsa_circ RNA_405443, hsa_circ RNA_403556, hsa_circ_0092328, hsa_circ_0003979, hsa_circ_0074491, hsa_circ_0023461, hsa_circ RNA_406237, hsa_circ_0034044, and hsa_circ RNA_400564 (fold change in descending order). The expression levels of hsa_circ_0001666 and hsa_circ_0062142 in CD were significantly higher than those in UC and HC (p < 0.01). ROC curves suggested the favorable diagnostic value of hsa_circ_0062142 and hsa_circ_0001666 (AUC = 0.803 and 0.858, respectively, p < 0.01). In silico analysis indicated that these circRNAs may be involved in the progress of CD. CONCLUSION: Hsa_circ_0062142 and hsa_circ_0001666 may play critical roles in the pathogenesis and serve as potential biomarkers of CD.","Hu, Yu-An; Zhu, Yan; Liu, Guorui; Yao, Xinyue; Yan, Xiaoling; Yang, Yang; Wang, Weiping; Zou, Xiaoping; Li, Xiaojun",J Clin Lab Anal,661,4

However, the relationship between these mental health indicators and immigrant populations' eating behaviors have not been addressed. Our objective was to analyze the mediating effects of acculturation stress and ethnic identity on the relationship between anxiety and three dimensions of eating behaviors in Colombian migrants living in Chile. A total of 959 Colombian immigrants participated. Ethnic identity only partially mediated the effect of emotional eating. The other two dimensions had direct effects but no mediating effects. Conversely, acculturation stress and emotional eating partially mediated restrained eating while external intake had a direct effect but no mediation. Anxiety had significant direct effects with all the dimensions analyzed. Ethnic identity score related to a protective effect between anxiety and emotional eating.

The COVID-19 pandemic response leveraged these innovations to enable rapid development of candidate vaccines within weeks of the viral genetic sequence being made available. The development of vaccines to tackle emerging infectious diseases is a priority for the World Health Organization and other global entities. More than 70% of emerging infectious diseases are acquired from animals, with some causing illness and death in both humans and the respective animal host. Yet the study of critical host-pathogen interactions and the underlying immune mechanisms to inform the development of vaccines for their control is traditionally done in medical and veterinary immunology 'silos'. In this Perspective, we highlight a 'One Health vaccinology' approach and discuss some key areas of synergy in human and veterinary vaccinology that could be exploited to accelerate the development of effective vaccines against these shared health threats.","Warimwe, George M; Francis, Michael J; Bowden, Thomas A; Thumbi, Samuel M; Charleston, Bryan",Nat. rev. immunol,661,22

In this review, we explore the events associated with SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and host immunopathological reactivity due to the clinical manifestations of this coronavirus infection. We discuss that the metallopeptidase enzyme ADAM17, also known as tumor necrosis factor-&#945;-converting enzyme, TACE, is responsible for shedding of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and membrane-bound interleukin (IL)-6 receptor. This leads to elevated pro-inflammatory responses that result in cytokine storm syndrome. We argue that cytokine balance may be restored by recovering an IL-6 trans-signaling neutralizing buffer system through the mediation of recombinant soluble glycoprotein 130 and recombinant ADAM17/TACE prodomain inhibitor. This cytokine restoration, possibly combined with inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 entry as well as replication and coagulopathy, could be introduced as a novel approach to treat patients with severe COVID-19.

Orv Hetil. 2021; 162(24): 931-937. INTRODUCTION: Beliefs regarding coronavirus vaccination provide very actual and socially important area in mental health research. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to differentiate the opinions related to coronavirus vaccination (acceptance, refusal, ignorance, hesitation). We analyzed advantages and disadvantages of vaccination, and the different channels in getting information about the vaccine. METHOD: Our study is part of the ""Longitudinal examination of mental factors caused by the coronavirus epidemic"" research project, wave of December 2020. We analyzed the responses of 1009 people by one-way analysis of variance tests. RESULTS: Our results show that elder people, males, and those who have higher education are more likely to accept the vaccine. In addition, those who live in Budapest and Cental Hungary are more likely to choose vaccination against the coronavirus than those living in other areas. The groups with different opinions on vaccination are better discriminated by benefit-related than risk-related opinions. Those benefit-related items showed the largest variance between groups, which focused on social usefulness on curbing the epidemics, preventing the spread of the infection. Analyzing the sources of information, we found that all groups rely more on personal (family, friends) and medical health information than on news from the media. CONCLUSION: The opinions of the vaccination groups differ mostly regarding the positive benefits of vaccination, especially the social usefulness. Opinions are mostly formed through personal relationships including relations with healthcare workers. Healthcare professionals therefore have a key role in providing a differentiated understanding of those seeking advice, providing expert information and appropriate advice.

In this letter to the editor, explanation of why each of these issues is concerning and how each subsequent issue grows in severity is provided. Particular focus on the issue of post-COVID-19 migration is made, as this challenge is quite pressing to health systems but has yet to be explored thoroughly in the literature. Possible strategies for health system planners to consider are provided in this letter. Strategies include involving stakeholders such as patients and clinicians in deliberations and deployment of interventions, focussing efforts on adapting primary health systems, and building on technology-enhanced models of care where possible.

Alterations in neurocognitive functions among patients with metabolic syndrome are important issues in this disorder. In this paper, studies on metabolic syndrome were reviewed and their importance emphasized for the benefit of experts and policy makers. Metabolic syndrome activates inflammatory mediators that disrupt brain metabolism. These mediators can be activated by metabolic inflammation and microvascular disorders and may further cause damage to the white matter and impair cognitive function. These alterations can result in serious changes in cognitive abilities. The association between cognitive changes and metabolic syndrome has been independently evaluated in several studies. In addition, some areas of research in the field of metabolic syndrome include the effectiveness of neurocognitive interventions to enhance normal behaviors or reduce risky behaviors in patients. Structural brain correlates of health-related behaviors provide a basis for designing more effective behavioral interventions by identifying the corresponding brain regions and using behavioral interventions.","Kordestani-Moghadam, Parastou; Assari, Shervin; Nouriyengejeh, Sarah; Mohammadipour, Fatemeh; Pourabbasi, Ata",,661,23

The structures of social contact critically determine the spread of the infection and, in the absence of vaccines, the control of these structures through large-scale social distancing measures appears to be the most effective means of mitigation. Here we use an age-structured SIR model with social contact matrices obtained from surveys and Bayesian imputation to study the progress of the COVID-19 epidemic in India. The basic reproductive ratio R0 and its time-dependent generalization are computed based on case data, age distribution and social contact structure. The impact of social distancing measures - workplace non-attendance, school closure, lockdown - and their efficacy with durations are then investigated. A three-week lockdown is found insufficient to prevent a resurgence and, instead, protocols of sustained lockdown with periodic relaxation are suggested. Forecasts are provided for the reduction in age-structured morbidity and mortality as a result of these measures. Our study underlines the importance of age and social contact structures in assessing the country-specific impact of mitigatory social distancing.","Singh, Rajesh; Adhikari, R.",,661,6

The Hopkins team published the first case report and case series as well as other evidence that isolated sudden onset anosmia (ISOA), should be considered highly suspicious for SARS-CoV-2(1). Subsequently, a larger series of 2428 patients presenting with new onset anosmia during the COVID-19 pandemic has been reported, of whom 16% report loss of sense of smell as an isolated symptom. Only 51% reported the recognized symptoms of cough or fever. A major limitation of this series however, was a lack of access to testing to confirm the COVID-19 status of the patients(2); in the 80 who had been tested 74% were positive. In the same way, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-head and neck surgery (AA0-HNS) proposed ""that anosmia could be added to the list of screening tools for possible COVID-19 infection. More, they warrant serious consideration for self-isolation and testing those patients"".","Lechien, J R; Hopkins, C; Saussez, S",Rhinology,661,32

MEASUREMENTS AND FINDINGS: Mental disorders were assessed using the ""Depression Anxiety Stress Scale"" and social support was determined using the ""Multidimensional Perceived Social Support Scale."" Pregnant women had moderate levels of anxiety and depression and mild levels of stress. Anxiety, depression, and stress of moderate or high severity was reported in 62.2%, 44.6%, and 32.2% of the women, respectively. Pregnant women who lost their jobs during the pandemic period showed a 3-fold increase in the risk of anxiety, a 6-fold increase in the risk of depression, and a 4.8-fold increase in the risk of stress. An increase in the perception of social support has protective effects against all three mental disorders during pregnancy. In pregnant women with at least one obstetric risk, the risk of antenatal anxiety is 2 times higher than that in women with no risk. Similarly, women with a chronic physical illness before pregnancy have a higher risk of anxiety during pregnancy than healthy women. Financial strain has predictive value for anxiety and depression, and advanced age is a predictor for depression. KEY CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of mental disorders in pregnant women during the pandemic period was much higher than that during the pre-pandemic period. The high frequency of antenatal mental disorders can lead to an increase in the frequency of obstetric and maternal complications in the short and long term. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Early detection of inadequate social support and economic difficulties of pregnant women during the pandemic period is recommended for protecting their mental health. Pregnant women should have easy access to psychosocial support, and they should be provided obstetric counseling during the pandemic conditions.","Koyucu, Refika Genç; Karaca, Pelin Palas",Midwifery,661,33

With the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) continuing to extend its timeline for ending the transmission of all wild polioviruses and to introduce new poliovirus vaccines, the polio vaccine supply chain continues to expand in complexity. The increased complexity leads to significant uncertainty about supply and costs. Notably, the strategy of phased OPV cessation of all three serotypes to stop all future incidence of poliomyelitis depends on successfully stopping the transmission of all wild polioviruses. Countries also face challenges associated with responding to any outbreaks that occur after OPV cessation, because stopping transmission of such outbreaks requires reintroducing the use of the stopped OPV in most countries. National immunization program leaders will likely consider differences in their risks and willingness-to-pay for risk reduction as they evaluate their investments in current and future polio vaccination. Information about the costs and benefits of future poliovirus vaccines, and discussion of the complex situation that currently exists, should prove useful to national, regional, and global decisionmakers and support health economic modeling.

These changes were described by survey data collected by the Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) program which were interpreted by a multi-institutional team of AMC pharmacists and physician investigators.Methods:The CTSA program surveyed 60 AMC pharmacy departments. The survey included event timing, impact on pharmacy services, and corrective actions taken.Results:Almost all departments (98.4%) reported at least one disruption. Shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) were common (91.5%) as were drug shortages (66.0%). To manage drug shortages, drug prioritization protocols were utilized, new drug supply vendors were identified (79.3%), and onsite compounding was initiated. PPE shortages were managed by incorporating the risk mitigation strategies recommended by FDA and others. Research pharmacists supported new clinical research initiatives at most institutions (84.0%), introduced use of virtual site visits, and shipped investigational drugs directly to patients. Some pharmacies formulated novel investigational products for clinical trial use. Those AMC pharmacies within networked health systems assisted partner rural and inner-city hospitals by sourcing commercial and investigational drugs to alleviate local disease outbreaks and shortages in underserved populations. Pharmacy-based vaccination practice was expanded to include a wider range of pediatric and adult vaccines.Conclusion:The COVID-19 pandemic radically altered hospital pharmacy practice.

The objective of the present study was to examine the associations between sharing physical activity experiences on SNS, positive self-presentation, positive feedback, and social connectedness during isolation. METHODS: Based on the Physical Activity Experience Sharing Scale, Social Connectedness Scale, Positive Self-Presentation Scale, and Online Positive Feedback Scale, we collected 460 questionnaires online from across 31 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions in China. We used multiple linear regression models to investigate the relationship between variables, and used bootstrapping to test for mediation.. RESULTS: During isolation, sharing physical activity experiences was positively associated with social connectedness (b = 0.308, p < 0.001), as well as with positive self-presentation(b = 0.956, p < 0.001)and positive feedback(b = 0.421, p < 0.001). In addition,we found that positive self-presentation showed a significant positive impact on positive feedback (b = 0.563, p < 0.001), and that positive self-presentation(b = 0.331, p < 0.001) and positive feedback(b = 0.311, p < 0.001) were positively associated with social connectedness. Finally, we found an effect on sharing physical activity experiences indirectly through positive self-presentation (b = 0.316, 95% CI: [0.180, 0.463]),and positive feedback (b = 0.131, 95% CI: [0.063, 0.207]) and that the mediation chain between the two also had a significant impact on social connectedness (b = 0.167, 95% CI: [0.088, 0.251]).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of asymptomatic deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in unselected patients with COVID-19 recently hospitalized in general wards. We performed a systematic complete doppler ultrasound (CDU) at a median 4 days after admission in 42 consecutive COVID-19 patients hospitalized in general wards of our university hospital, irrespective of D-Dimer level, and retrospectively collected clinical, biological and outcome data from electronic charts. Thromboprophylaxis was systematically applied following a French national proposal.

Symptomatic pulmonary embolism was detected in 4 (9.5%) patients, associated to DVT in one case. Compared to patients without DVT, patients with DVT were older and experienced poorer outcomes. In conclusion, prevalence of asymptomatic DVT is high in the first days of hospitalization of unselected COVID-19 patients in general wards and may be related to poor prognosis. Individualized assessment of thromboprophylaxis and early systematic screening for DVT is warranted in this context.","Le Jeune, Sylvain; Suhl, Jaehyo; Benainous, Ruben; Minvielle, François; Purser, Christine; Foudi, Farid; Warzocha, Ursula; Dhote, Robin",J. thromb. thrombolysis,661,11

To provide an indication of what these outcomes may be, we studied eyes with active lesions with unplanned treatment interval extensions before the pandemic occurred. METHODS: We compared eyes with active disease despite &#8804;6 weekly injections whose next injection was extended to &#8805;7 weeks and those whose intervals were not extended. We identified 1559 (16%) of 9602 eyes from the Fight Retinal Blindness! (FRB!) registry (2013 and 2018) that fit this criteria. Eyes were further stratified into four groups by the mean interval over the following 6 months: (1) &#8804;6 weeks (81%), (2) 7-9 weeks (9%), (3) 10-12 weeks (5%) and (4) >12 weeks (5%). RESULTS: There was a significant loss in VA in eyes extended to >12 weeks compared to the non-extended group (adjusted VA change, mean (95% CI): &#8804;6 weeks, 0.4 (-1.5 to 2.2), versus >12 weeks, -4.7 (-7.4 to -2.1), letters, p = 0.03 and a threefold increase in relative risk of losing &#8805;15 letters (absolute risk (14% versus 4%, p < 0.01)). CONCLUSION: Mean VA remained stable for 6 months in eyes requiring frequent treatment despite retreatment interval extension up to 10-12 weeks. There was a significant short-term risk to vision when retreatment interval was extended beyond 12 weeks, hence extensions to this level should be considered cautiously.

Mixed modelling was performed to examine GGT and alcohol consumption in association with telomere length in buccal cells of 211 adults between 18 and 30 years old of the East Flanders Prospective Twin Survey. In addition, we investigated the association between GGT and cardiometabolic risk factors; waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, fasting glucose, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides.

During the expanding epidemic of the new coronavirus infection COVID-19 in our country, medical workers were one of the groups at the increased risk of infection. Simultaneously, certain information about the number of cases and duration of this disease in medical workers is not available in official sources. However, this information is necessary to develop effective preventive measures, assess economic damage from a temporary disability, and the planning of medical personnel in emergency epidemic conditions. Purpose of study. To investigate the incidence of the temporary disability of employees of a medical institution with a new coronavirus infection connected with the performance of their occupational duties to assess the health risks for medical workers, develop appropriate measures to improve the safety system of their work. Material and methods. The study was conducted by a continuous process based on the country's largest repurposed infectious diseases hospital to treat COVID-19 patients using the classical method of analyzing morbidity rates with the temporary disability. Results. The dynamics of the main indices of the morbidity with the temporary disability since the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic was revealed. Features of the morbidity by groups of personnel working in the ""red"" and ""green"" zones of the infectious hospital are established. The incidence of medical personnel providing medical care to patients with COVID-19 was proved to be associated with the implementation of professional activities, but not in all cases. This type of personnel is also subject to risks of infection outside the medical institution. Conclusion.

However, these new assays need to be evaluated and validated. The purpose of this study was to assess the performance of five immunoassays (two ELISA and three CLIA assays) and one rapid immunochromatographic test for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. METHODS: Five semiquantitative immunoassays (MENARINI®, PALEX®, VIRCLIA®, ROCHE® and SIEMENS®) and one lateral flow rapid test (WONDFO®) were performed. A total of 124 samples were studied. Case serum samples (n=78) were obtained from COVID-19 patients confirmed by real-time RT-PCR/epidemiological-clinical-radiological criteria, and control non-SARS-CoV-2 samples (n=46) belonged to healthy healthcare workers involved in a seroprevalence study. RESULTS: Overall, the tests showed sensitivities around 70-90% and specificities greater than 95%, including the immunochromatographic test. In addition, we observed very good agreements among them, being better for the detection of IgG than for IgM antibodies (Cohen's kappa index of 0.95 for VIRCLIA® IgG with ROCHE®), as well as good diagnostic power of the tests as determined by the ROC curves. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the proper performance of the different immunoassays in order to be applied in the clinical practice as support in the diagnostic approach and in the development of vaccines and seroepidemiological studies of COVID-19.","Montolio Breva, Silvia; Molina Clavero, Carmen; Gómez Bertomeu, Frederic; Picó-Plana, Ester; Serrat Orús, Núria; Palau Sánchez, Inmaculada; Mestre-Prad, Maria Teresa; Sans-Mateu, Maria Teresa",Enferm. infecc. microbiol. clin.

Methods: Based on our previous study, the main compounds in FF were selected. The potential targets of FF were searched by Swiss Target Prediction and BATMAN-TCM database. GenCLiP 3 and GeneCard were used to predict and screen the therapeutic targets of COVID-19, and then Cytoscape 3.7.1 was used to build the compound-target-disease network. The String database was used to build the target PPI network. Gene ontology (GO) function enrichment analysis and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis were performed in the DAVID database. Molecular docking was performed based on the above compounds and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 3CL hydrolase and angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2). Results: The compound-target-disease network contained 14 compounds, 104 targets and four diseases. GO function enrichment analysis revealed 444 GO items (P &lt; 0.05), including 325 biological process (BP) items, 44 cell composition (CC) items and 75 molecular function (MF) items. A total of 94 signal pathways (P &lt; 0.05) were screened out by KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. The results of molecular docking showed that the affinity of 3,4-dicaffeoylquinic acid and 4,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid with proteins were better than Remdesivir. Conclusion: The compounds in FF can bind with SARS-CoV-2 3CL hydrolase and ACE2, and then act on many targets to regulate multiple signaling pathways, thus exerting the therapeutic effect on COVID-19.","Fan, Jian-Xin; Qin, Xue-Mei; Li, Zhen-Yu",Chin.

Guidelines on the use of illness severity scores to inform triage decisions for allocation of scarce resources, such as mechanical ventilation, during the current COVID-19 pandemic warrant examination for possible bias in these models. We investigated the performance of the severity scoring systems Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation IVa (APACHE IVa), Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score (OASIS), and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) across four ethnicities in two large ICU databases to identify possible ethnicity-based bias. METHODS: Data from the electronic ICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) and the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database, built from patient episodes in the USA from 2014-15 and 2001-12, respectively, were analysed for score performance in Asian, Black, Hispanic, and White people after appropriate exclusions. Hospital mortality was the outcome of interest. Discrimination and calibration were determined for all three scoring systems in all four groups, using area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve for different ethnicities to assess discrimination, and standardised mortality ratio (SMR) or proxy measures to assess calibration. FINDINGS: We analysed 166â751 participants (122â919 eICU-CRD and 43â832 MIMIC-III). Although measurements of discrimination were significantly different among the groups (AUROC ranging from 0·86 to 0·89 [p=0·016] with APACHE IVa and from 0·75 to 0·77 [p=0·85] with OASIS), they did not display any discernible systematic patterns of bias. However, measurements of calibration indicated persistent, and in some cases statistically significant, patterns of difference between Hispanic people (SMR 0·73 with APACHE IVa and 0·64 with OASIS) and Black people (0·67 and 0·68) versus Asian people (0·77 and 0·95) and White people (0·76 and 0·81). Although calibrations were imperfect for all groups, the scores consistently showed a pattern of overpredicting mortality for Black people and Hispanic people. Similar results were seen using SOFA scores across the two databases. INTERPRETATION: The systematic differences in calibration across ethnicities suggest that illness severity scores reflect statistical bias in their predictions of mortality.

METHODS: A cohort study of COVID-19 patients in Tongji Hospital, from January 2020 to February 2020, was evaluated. Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test was performed to analyze survival data. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed with COX proportional hazard regression model. The primary and secondary outcomes were in-hospital mortality and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), respectively. RESULTS: Total 320 adult patients were enrolled in our analyses. Patients were divided into low IL-6/LY group and high IL-6/LY group based on the cutoff value with 2.50. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that high-value group (IL-6/LY &#8805; 2.50) had a greater risk of poor prognosis (P < 0.001, respectively). Multivariate analysis indicated that IL-6/LY was the independent risk predictor for in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 3.404; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.090-10.633, P = 0.035) and MODS development (HR, 4.143; 95%CI, 1.321-12.986, P = 0.015). Meanwhile, IL-6/LY was positively correlated with the MuLBSTA score (r = 0.137, P = 0.031), suggesting that IL-6/LY was associated with long-term mortality (90-day). Furthermore, kinetic analysis revealed that the dynamic changes of inflammatory immune indexes were related to the severity of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: The elevated IL-6/LY was related with the increased risk of poor prognosis. Not only that, IL-6/LY could be used for risk stratification and early clinical identification of high-risk patients.","Yang, Boyi; Chang, Xiaoyan; Huang, Jiabao; Pan, Wen; Si, Zhilong; Zhang, Cuntai; Li, Hong",Int Immunopharmacol,661,6

Gradual increases in the number of COVID-19 cases meant they were inadequately protected from contamination due to a shortage of protective equipment, excessive workloads, emotional exhaustion and frustration. These circumstances affect their work performance in delivering health services. This study aims to compare the levels of anxiety in frontline and non-frontline healthcare providers during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study applied a comparative cross-sectional design between May and July 2020 at the Hospital Raja Perempuan Zainab II. Convenient sampling was applied in the selection of eligible participants. The case report form contained two self-administered questionnaires, namely, The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Medical Outcome Study Social Support Survey. Descriptive analysis, analysis of variance, and analysis of covariance were conducted using SPSS version 26. The number of participants recruited was 306, including 160 healthcare providers in the frontline group and 146 in the non-frontline group. The non-frontline healthcare providers reported a significantly higher anxiety mean score of 1.7 than the frontline providers after adjusting for gender, duration of employment, and social support. It indicates that non-frontline healthcare providers require psychological support similar to that of frontline healthcare providers during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Mohd Noor, Norhayati; Che Yusof, Ruhana; Yacob, Mohd Azman",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),661,16

Patient Chosen Gap Payments (PCGPs) allow patients to specify a (voluntary) out-of-pocket contribution, creating an incentive for patient-centred care without the need for complex outcomes-based funding formulae. It is not yet known if widespread use of PCGP services is consistent with consumer preferences. We conducted a discrete choice experiment (DCE) in a sample of the adult Australian general population (n = 1457) during April 2019 to simulate patient choice between alternative primary care services and describe preferences for PCGP services. Participants also completed a supplementary valuation task in which participants reported their intended PCGP contribution for PCGP services. Finally, we conducted policy-simulations to predict market shares when PCGP clinics operate alongside the two existing models of primary care funding in Australia. Results suggest that patients prefer shorter wait time, longer consults, lower compulsory copayments, services with higher patient satisfaction ratings, choice of doctor and $0 suggested voluntary contribution for PCGP services. Policy-simulations suggest that high-quality PCGP services could obtain market share of up to 39% and voluntary contributions of up to $25.36 per service (95%CI: $10.24, $40.47), potentially adding $1.48 billion AUD in revenues and funding for primary care at no cost to government. Low-quality PCGP services are unlikely to capture significant market share and PCGP contributions were lowest for low-quality PCGP services ($12.12, 95%CI: $2.09, $26.34). Further field testing is recommended where (i) patients make consequential choices (e.g. real payments for simulated services), and (ii) dynamic effects on quality of care and utilisation can be observed; particularly in vulnerable populations. We conclude that PCGP services aligned with patient preferences could capture significant market share and substantially increase revenue to general practice.","Epstein, D S; Barton, C; Mazza, D; Woode, M E; Mortimer, D",Soc Sci Med,661,4

The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of these restrictions on behaviours and well-being and whether individual differences predict changes in well-being. METHODS: Australian adults participated in a cross-sectional, online survey during May 2020. The survey captured demographic information; health behaviours; personality traits; life satisfaction and COVID-19-related attitudes, financial concerns, perceived risks and impacts. RESULTS: In total, 3745 (86.8% of 4313) participants completed all items. Participants were mostly female (85.7%) and 56.4 years (standard deviation [SD] = 12.6) on average. Over 95.0% of the sample indicated they had been social distancing or isolating. Health behaviours and well-being had generally worsened, with social connections being the most negatively affected. Life satisfaction was significantly lower since restrictions. For changes in life satisfaction, extroversion was a risk factor and openness to experience was a protective factor. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, well-being was negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and associated social distancing particularly in this sample containing mainly older women. In future, it will be crucial to understand why and who may be differentially affected, to encourage behaviours that are protective of well-being.","Brindal, Emily; Ryan, Jillian C; Kakoschke, Naomi; Golley, Sinead; Zajac, Ian T; Wiggins, Bonnie",J. public health (Oxf),661,14

METHODS: Our study prospectively included 26 consecutive patients with ruptured intracranial aneurysm managed at our institution in context of COVID-19 pandemic between March 1st, 2020 and April, 26th, 2020 (2020 group). A group control included other 28 consecutive patients managed at the same institution for the same disease in 2019, during the same time frame (2019 group). On admission, poor neurological status was defined as WFNS score >3. Severe radiological status was defined by the presence of intracerebral hematoma, or/and acute hydrocephalus requiring further EVD or/and the presence of vasospasm on presentation. Statistical analysis was performed to compare the 2 distinct groups. RESULTS: Rates of poor neurological presentation and severe radiological presentation on hospital admission were higher in the 2020 group (p = 0.01 and p = 0.02, respectively). The delayed hospital admission was 2.7 days in 2020 group and 0.75 days in 2019 group (p = 0.005). Therefore, vasospasm's rate on presentation was also higher in the 2020 group (p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies demonstrating influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with urgent and severe intracranial aneurysmal disease.

STUDY DESIGN: This is a nationwide retrospective cohort study that was conducted in Mexico. METHODS: Data from 258 reinfection cases (at least 28 days between both episodes onset) were analyzed. We used risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to evaluate predictors of severe (dyspnea requiring hospital admission) secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: The risk of severe disease was 14.7%, and the observed overall fatality rate was 4.3%. Patients with more serious primary disease were more likely to develop severe symptoms (39.5% vs. 5.5%, P < 0.001) during reinfection. In multiple analysis, factors associated with an increased risk of severe symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 reinfection were increasing age (RRper year = 1.007, 95% CI = 1.003-1.010), comorbidities (namely, obesity [RR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.01-1.24], asthma [RR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.06-1.50], type 2 diabetes mellitus [RR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.07-1.38]), and previous severe laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (RR = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.03-1.39). CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating disease outcomes in a large set of laboratory-positive cases of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 reinfection, and factors associated with illness severity were characterized. Our results may contribute to the current knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity and to identify populations at increased risk of a poorer outcome after reinfection.","Murillo-Zamora, E; Mendoza-Cano, O; Delgado-Enciso, I; Hernandez-Suarez, C M",Public Health,661,23

SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are higher in severely or critically ill COVID-19 patients, but studies have not focused on levels in convalescent patients with MetS, which this study aimed to assess. METHODS: This retrospective study focused on adult convalescent outpatients with SARS-CoV-2 positive serology during the COVID-19 pandemic at NewYork Presbyterian/Weill Cornell. Data collected for descriptive and correlative analysis included SARS-COV-2 immunoglobin G (IgG) levels and history of MetS comorbidities from April 17, 2020 to May 20, 2020. Additional data, including SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels, body mass index (BMI), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and lipid levels were collected and analyzed for a second cohort from May 21, 2020 to June 21, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies were measured in a subset of the study cohort. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels were significantly higher in convalescent individuals with MetS comorbidities. When adjusted for age, sex, race, and time duration from symptom onset to testing, increased SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels remained significantly associated with obesity (P < 0.0001). SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels were significantly higher in patients with HbA1c &#8805;6.5% compared to those with HbA1c <5.7% (P = 0.0197) and remained significant on multivariable analysis (P = 0.0104).

The authors hypothesize that decreases in emergency department volume, less emergency department boarding of admissions, reduced use of hallway beds, and favorable attitudes toward emergency physicians during the COVID-19 outbreak may influence patient satisfaction scores measured in the Press Ganey surveys. Study Design and Methods: The authors performed a retrospective review of PG scores obtained over the prior 7 months at 8 larger teaching hospitals in the Southeast region (Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina). Averaged physician PG Scores and their 4 components-courtesy, time to listen, informative regarding treatment, concern for comfort-were collected. The authors evaluated the overall physician PG ratings for March through May 2020 (COVID outbreak) vs the prior 4 months. Overall emergency physician scores, using top box methodology of percent highest response, were averaged from 4 questions regarding the emergency physician's care. Results: There were 6272 patient satisfaction surveys returned in the 7-month study period; 4003 responses during the pre-COVID months (November 2019-February 2020) and 2296 during the COVID months (March through May 2020). Results showed that in the ""pre-COVID time"" the PG surveys scored in the 17% of all PGs in the country (63.9% ""top-box"" or highest rating score) as compared to scoring in the 34% of all PGs (68.1% ""top-box"") during ""COVID time."" These data were statistically significant using a chi-square analysis with P < 0.001.

Smell loss has been associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, but it is unknown whether monitoring for smell loss can be used to identify asymptomatic infection among high risk individuals. In this study we sought to determine if tracking smell sensitivity and loss using an at-home assessment could identify SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCW. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We performed a prospective cohort study tracking 473 HCW across three months to determine if smell loss could predict SARS-CoV-2 infection in this high-risk group. HCW subjects completed a longitudinal, behavioral at-home assessment of olfaction with household items, as well as detailed symptom surveys that included a parosmia screening questionnaire, and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction testing to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our main measures were the prevalence of smell loss in SARS-CoV-2-positive HCW versus SARS-CoV-2-negative HCW, and timing of smell loss relative to SARS-CoV-2 test positivity. SARS-CoV-2 was identified in 17 (3.6%) of 473 HCW. HCW with SARS-CoV-2 infection were more likely to report smell loss than SARS-CoV-2-negative HCW on both the at-home assessment and the screening questionnaire (9/17, 53% vs 105/456, 23%, P < .01). 6/9 (67%) of SARS-CoV-2-positive HCW reporting smell loss reported smell loss prior to having a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, and smell loss was reported a median of two days before testing positive. Neurological symptoms were reported more frequently among SARS-CoV-2-positive HCW who reported smell loss compared to those without smell loss (9/9, 100% vs 3/8, 38%, P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective study of HCW, self-reported changes in smell using two different measures were predictive of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Smell loss frequently preceded a positive test and was associated with neurological symptoms.","Weiss, Julian J; Attuquayefio, Tuki N; White, Elizabeth B; Li, Fangyong; Herz, Rachel S; White, Theresa L; Campbell, Melissa; Geng, Bertie; Datta, Rupak; Wyllie, Anne L; Grubaugh, Nathan D; Casanovas-Massana, Arnau; Muenker, M Catherine; Moore, Adam J; Handoko, Ryan; Iwasaki, Akiko; Martinello, Richard A; Ko, Albert I; Small, Dana M; Farhadian, Shelli F",PLoS One,661,1

In Mainland China, the containment measures consist of three types, i.e., Wuhan travel ban, intra-city quarantine and isolation, and inter-city travel restriction. In order to carry out the measures, local economy and information acquisition play an important role. In this paper, we investigate the correlation of local economy and the information acquisition on the execution of containment measures to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic in Mainland China. First, we use a parsimonious model, i.e., SIR-X model, to estimate the parameters, which represent the execution of intra-city quarantine and isolation in major cities of Mainland China. In order to understand the execution of intra-city quarantine and isolation, we analyze the correlation between the representative parameters including local economy, mobility, and information acquisition. To this end, we collect the data of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the inflows from Wuhan and outflows, and the COVID-19 related search frequency from a widely-used Web mapping service, i.e., Baidu Maps, and Web search engine, i.e., Baidu Search Engine, in Mainland China. Based on the analysis, we confirm the strong correlation between the local economy and the execution of information acquisition in major cities of Mainland China. We further evidence that, although the cities with high GDP per capita attracts bigger inflows from Wuhan, people are more likely to conduct the quarantine measure and to reduce going out to other cities. Finally, the correlation analysis using search data shows that well-informed individuals are likely to carry out containment measures.","Liu, Ji; Wang, Xiakai; Xiong, Haoyi; Huang, Jizhou; Huang, Siyu; An, Haozhe; Dou, Dejing; Wang, Haifeng",,661,26

The Kenyan government embarked to fill capacity gaps in essential and advanced critical care needed for the management of severe and critical COVID-19. However, given scarce resources, gaps in both essential and advanced critical care persist. This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of investments in essential and advanced critical care to inform the prioritization of investment decisions. MethodsWe employed a decision tree model to assess the incremental cost-effectiveness of investment in essential care (EC) and investment in both essential and advanced critical care (EC+ACC) compared to current health care provision capacity (status quo) for COVID-19 patients in Kenya. We used a health system perspective, and an inpatient care episode time horizon. Cost data was obtained from primary empirical analysis while outcomes data was obtained from epidemiological model estimates. We used univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) to assess the robustness of the results. ResultsThe status quo option is more costly and less effective compared to investment in essential care and is thus dominated by the later. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of Investment in essential and advanced critical care (EC+ACC) was US $1,378.21 per DALY averted and hence not a cost-effective strategy when compared to Kenyas cost-effectiveness threshold (USD 908). ConclusionWhen the criterion of cost-effectiveness is considered, and within the context of resource scarcity, Kenya will achieve better value for money if it prioritizes investments in essential care before investments in advanced critical care. This information on cost-effectiveness will however need to be considered as part of a multi-criteria decision-making framework that uses a range of criteria that reflect societal values of the Kenyan society.

We have adopted a cross-sectional survey design to investigate the impact of Saudi lockdown on blockade COVID-19 by using an anonymous online questionnaire. The targeted population of the study was Saudi citizens and non-Saudi residents of different ages. The collected data were entered into Microsoft Excel (version 2011) and analyzed by using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), version 23.

A comparison of this predicted epitope MHC-coverage revealed for the early phase of infection spread (till day 15 after reaching 128 observed infection cases) highly significant negative correlations with the case fatality rate. Specifically, this was observed in different populations for MHC class II presentation of the viral spike protein (p-value: 0.0733 for linear regression), the envelope protein (p-value: 0.023), and the membrane protein (p-value: 0.00053), indicating that the high case fatality rates of COVID-19 observed in some countries seem to be related with poor MHC class II presentation and hence weak adaptive immune response against these viral envelope proteins. Our results highlight the general importance of the SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins in immunological control in early infection spread looking at a global census in various countries and taking case fatality rate into account. Other factors such as health system and control measures become more important after the early spread. Our study should encourage further studies on MHCII alleles as potential risk factors in COVID-19 including assessment of local populations and specific allele distributions.","Liang, Chunguang; Bencurova, Elena; Psota, Eric; Neurgaonkar, Priya; Prelog, Martina; Scheller, Carsten; Dandekar, Thomas",Int. j. mol. sci.

Modelling results obtained from analytical tool development are essential to understand the ongoing pandemic dynamics with a view to helping the public and policy makers. The pandemic has generated data on a huge number of interesting statistics such as the number of new cases, hospitalisations and deaths in many spatio-temporal resolutions for the analysts to investigate. The multivariate nature of these data sets, along with the inherent spatio-temporal dependencies, poses new challenges for modellers. This article proposes a two-stage hierarchical Bayesian model as a joint bivariate model for the number of cases and deaths observed weekly for the different local authority administrative regions in England. An adaptive model is proposed for the weekly Covid-19 death rates as part of the joint bivariate model. The adaptive model is able to detect possible step changes in death rates in neighbouring areas. The joint model is also used to evaluate the effects of several socio-economic and environmental covariates on the rates of cases and deaths. Inclusion of these covariates points to the presence of a north-south divide in both the case and death rates. Nitrogen dioxide, the only air pollution measure used in the model, is seen to be significantly positively associated with the number cases, even in the presence of the spatio-temporal random effects taking care of spatio-temporal dependencies present in the data. The proposed models provide excellent fits to the observed data and are seen to perform well for predicting the location specific number of deaths a week in advance. The structure of the models is very general and the same framework can be used for modelling other areally aggregated temporal statistics of the pandemics, e.g. the rate of hospitalisation.","Sahu, Sujit K; Böhning, Dankmar",Spat Stat,661,16

Cheaper and faster alternatives, such as antigen and paper-strip tests, have been proposed. They return results rapidly, but have lower sensitivity thresholds for detecting virus. To quantify the effects of the tradeoffs between sensitivity, cost, testing frequency, and delay in test return on the overall course of an outbreak, we built a multi-scale immuno-epidemiological model that connects the virus profile of infected individuals with transmission and testing at the population level. We investigated various randomized testing strategies and found that, for fixed testing capacity, lower sensitivity tests with shorter return delays slightly flatten the daily incidence curve and delay the time to the peak daily incidence. However, compared with RT-PCR testing, they do not always reduce the cumulative case count at half a year into the outbreak. When testing frequency is increased to account for the lower cost of less sensitive tests, we observe a large reduction in cumulative case counts, from 55.4% to as low as 1.22% half a year into the outbreak. The improvement is preserved even when the testing budget is reduced by one half or one third. Our results predict that surveillance testing that employs low-sensitivity tests at high frequency is an effective tool for epidemic control.","Forde, Jonathan E; Ciupe, Stanca M",Viruses,661,16

METHODS: a multi-cohort, deterministic, static Markov model was populated by real-world data on the clinical and economic impact of Influenza-Like Illness and Lower Respiratory Tract Infection over 1 year. Four scenarios featuring different vaccine coverage rates were compared with the base case; coverage rates in subjects with and without risk factors were considered separately. RESULTS: compared with the base case, adopting scenarios 1-4 would reduce the annual number of influenza cases by 6.5%, 10.8%, 13.8% and 3.4%, Emergency Department accesses by 10.7%, 9.1%, 15.4% and 4.6%, complications by 8.9%, 9.9%, 14.7% and 4.1%, and the hospitalization of complicated cases by 11%, 9.1%, 15.4% and 4.5%, respectively. The four scenarios would require an additional investment (vaccine purchase and administration) of 316,996, 529,174, 677,539, and 168,633, respectively, in comparison with the base case. Scenario 1 proved to be cost-saving in the 60-64-year age-group. The incremental costs of implementing the other hypothetical scenarios ranged from 2.7% (scenario 4) to 13.2% (scenario 3). CONCLUSIONS: lowering the recommended age for influenza vaccination to 60 years would allow a high proportion of subjects at risk for severe influenza to be reached and would save money.","Trucchi, Cecilia; D039,; Amelio, Marco; Amicizia, Daniela; Orsi, Andrea; Loiacono, Idalba; Tosatto, Roberta; Piazza, Maria Francesca; Paganino, Chiara; Pitrelli, Andrea; Icardi, Giancarlo; Ansaldi, Filippo",Hum Vaccin Immunother,661,30

This tumor is more common in men than women, with a ratio of 2.7:1. Unlike HCC, Dysplasia is the precancerous nature of liver nodules and is characterized by cellular and nuclear enlargement, nuclear pleomorphism, and multinucleation. Area based Adaptive Expectation Maximization (EM) uses texture, layout, and context features of cells, and grows clusters to obtain texton maps of nucleus. A discriminative model of nucleus and cytoplastic changes of tumor is built by incorporating texture, layout, and context information efficiently. A bootsrap regression model of nuclei and cytoplastic changes are built by incorporating the aforementioned features efficiently. Mean squared error, Peak Signal to Noise ratio and Dice similarity values are used to evaluate the method's classification performance. The proposed method provides high classification and segmentation accuracy of nucleus and extra nuclear content in HCC and dysplasia, which are exceedingly textured in histopathology images, when compared to Adaptive K means, EM method and the state-of-the-art method, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). As texton detection reduces the cluttered background of nuclei, the proposed method would be a convenient mechanism for the classification of nuclei and non-nuclear features. In conclusion, this system can detect more eligible cells of precancerous nature as well as malignant cells even in a cluttered background of nuclei.","Kalinathan, Lekshmi; Kathavarayan, Ruba Soundar; Kanmani, Madheswari; Dinakaran, Nagendram",Histol Histopathol,661,1

In Malaysia, the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health is a fundamental human right without discrimination for every human being. Consequently, the principle of the ""right to health,"" regardless of the legal status of an individual, is the driving force in creating acceptable standards of health care for all citizens. Even for individual who suffers from Covid-19, he still has a fundamental right to health. The issue of the right to health is whether the patients have any rights of their health? If they do have the right to health, the next issue is whether the hospitals are legally bound to follow such right, i.e. the right to health of the patients. Therefore, this paper aims to analyse and discuss the issues regarding the rights to health of the patients. Without the legal mechanism in recognising the right to health, it pointed out that is no such right. The method employed in this paper is qualitative based. The paper finds that although Malaysia does not have any specific legal framework about the right to health, the application of international legal mechanism can be referred to a guideline.

Similarly to influenza, several authors have described a higher risk of fungal infection after COVID-19, in particular for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. The main objective here is to define the prevalence of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) in a cohort of COVID-19 patients with moderate to severe acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS). MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a large monocentric retrospective study investigating all the ventilated COVID-19 patients with ARDS hospitalized at Valenciennes' general hospital, France, between March 15, 2020 and April 30, 2020. In the center a systematic IPA screening strategy was carried out for all ARDS patients, with weekly tests of serum galactomannan and beta-D-glucan. Bronchoalveolar lavage with culture and chest CT scan were performed when the serum assays were positives. RESULTS: A total of 54 patients were studied. Their median age was 65 years, and 37 of the patients (71%) were male. Two patients had chronic immunosuppression and among all the patients, only 2 non-immunocompromised presented a putative IPA during their stay. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of IPA in this cohort of COVID-19 patients (3.7%) is not higher than what is described in the other ARDS populations in the literature. These results are however different from the previous publications on COVID-19 patients and must therefore be confirmed by larger and multicentric studies.","Versyck, Maaike; Zarrougui, Wafa; Lambiotte, Fabien; Elbeki, Nabil; Saint-Leger, Piehr",J Mycol Med,661,20

The Korean government entrusted large-scale hospitals with the operation of living and treatment support centers (LTSCs) for the management for clinically healthy COVID-19 patients. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to introduce our experience implementing information and communications technology (ICT)-based remote patient management systems at a COVID-19 LTSC. METHODS: We adopted new electronic health record templates, hospital information system (HIS) dashboards, cloud-based medical image sharing, a mobile app, and smart vital sign monitoring devices. RESULTS: Enhancements were made to the HIS to assist in the workflow and care of patients in the LTSC. A dashboard was created for the medical staff to view the vital signs and symptoms of all patients. Patients used a mobile app to consult with their physician or nurse, answer questionnaires, and input self-measured vital signs; the results were uploaded to the hospital information system in real time. Cloud-based image sharing enabled interoperability between medical institutions. Korea's strategy of aggressive mitigation has ""flattened the curve"" of the rate of infection. A multidisciplinary approach was integral to develop systems supporting patient care and management at the living and treatment support center as quickly as possible. CONCLUSIONS: Faced with a novel infectious disease, we describe the implementation and experience of applying an ICT-based patient management system in the LTSC affiliated with Seoul National University Hospital. ICT-based tools and applications are increasingly important in health care, and we hope that our experience will provide insight into future technology-based infectious disease responses.","Bae, Ye Seul; Kim, Kyung Hwan; Choi, Sae Won; Ko, Taehoon; Jeong, Chang Wook; Cho, BeLong; Kim, Min Sun; Kang, EunKyo",J Med Internet Res,661,20

The COVID-19: Global Efforts for Development, Clinical Trials and Distribution Symposium brought together leading scientists, clinicians, pharma, decision makers, academic institutions and businesses to present and discuss the vaccines that are being currently developed for the COVID19. This event was held to shed light on these vaccines as many are at the late stage of Phase III clinical trials and ready to be marketed. This follows the confusion that few vaccines were produced and pushed into phase III without sharing all the necessary data preventing the scientific and clinical community to judge its efficacy and safety. This event allowed a discussion into the challenges in the distribution, pricing and accessibility of the vaccines. Moreover, the symposium discussed the importance to invest in Biotech-Pharma to combat and overcome any future health crisis.

It can lead to multiorgan failure, including respiratory and cardiovascular decompensation, and kidney injury, with significant associated morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients with underlying metabolic, cardiovascular, respiratory or kidney disease. Dapagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor, has shown significant cardio- and renoprotective benefits in patients with type 2 diabetes (with and without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease), heart failure and chronic kidney disease, and may provide similar organ protection in high-risk patients with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DARE-19 (NCT04350593) is an investigator-initiated, collaborative, international, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study testing the dual hypotheses that dapagliflozin can reduce the incidence of cardiovascular, kidney and/or respiratory complications or all-cause mortality, or improve clinical recovery, in adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 but not critically ill on admission. Eligible patients will have &#8805;1 cardiometabolic risk factor for COVID-19 complications. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to dapagliflozin 10 mg or placebo. Primary efficacy endpoints are time to development of new or worsened organ dysfunction during index hospitalization, or all-cause mortality, and the hierarchical composite endpoint of change in clinical status through day 30 of treatment. Safety of dapagliflozin in individuals with COVID-19 will be assessed. CONCLUSIONS: DARE-19 will evaluate whether dapagliflozin can prevent COVID-19-related complications and all-cause mortality, or improve clinical recovery, and assess the safety profile of dapagliflozin in this patient population. Currently, DARE-19 is the first large randomized controlled trial investigating use of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in patients with COVID-19.","Kosiborod, Mikhail; Berwanger, Otavio; Koch, Gary G; Martinez, Felipe; Mukhtar, Omar; Verma, Subodh; Chopra, Vijay; Javaheri, Ali; Ambery, Philip; Gasparyan, Samvel B; Buenconsejo, Joan; Sjöström, C David; Langkilde, Anna Maria; Oscarsson, Jan; Esterline, Russell",Diabetes Obes Metab,661,24

Since the emergence, research has explored conditions associated with the illness; however, racial disparities remain underexplored. The purpose of this paper is to explore disparities in conditions associated with an increased severity risk of COVID-19 including race, personal factors, healthcare accessibility, and affordability. Using data from the 2018 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), univariate and multivariate analysis were performed. More Non-Hispanic (NH) Blacks (61.1%) and NH Whites (61.2%) had conditions associated with increased severity risk of COVID-19 compared to Hispanics (47.1%) (p < .001). Racial differences revealed a higher proportion of NH Blacks with increased severity risk of COVID-19 were female (p < .001), not married (p < .001), not employed for wages (p < .001), had accessibility issues with transportation (p < .001), and had affordability issues with paying for medicine (p < .001). A higher proportion of Hispanic persons had a health place change (p = .020), had accessibility issues (e.g. telephone (p < .001), longer wait times (p < .001), closed facility (p = .038)) and had affordability issue with worrying about pay (p < .001). Significant predictors that were positively associated with increased severity risk of COVID-19 for all racial/ethnic groups were being NH Black, older age, having appointment issues, and affordability issues with medicine. Differences in magnitude across racial group dynamics were observed. Racial disparities exist in conditions associated with increased severity risk of COVID-19. As future policies and interventions are developed, it is important to consider differentials across racial group dynamics.","Clay, Shondra Loggins; Woodson, Markisha J; Mazurek, Kathryn; Antonio, Beverly",Race Soc Probl,661,26

We aimed to differentiate the associations between NO2 exposure and YLL from major pathological types of stroke in China, and estimate the relevant economic loss. A time-series study was conducted to explore the associations between short-term NO2 exposure and YLL from ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke from 2013 to 2017 in 48 Chinese cities. Daily NO2 data and stroke mortality counts for each city were obtained from the National Urban Air Quality Real-time Publishing Platform and Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, respectively. Generalized additive models were applied to estimate the cumulative effects of NO2 in each city, and meta-analysis was used to combine the city-specific estimates. The relevant economic loss was estimated using the method of the value per statistical life year (VSLY). A 10 µg/m3 increase in ambient NO2 concentration on the present day and previous day (lag 0-1) would lead to relatively higher increments in percentage change of YLL from ischaemic stroke (0.82%, 95% CI: 0.46%, 1.19%) than haemorrhagic stroke (0.46%, 95% CI: 0.09%, 0.84%). The association was significantly stronger in the low-education population than high-education population for ischaemic stroke. Furthermore, significantly higher association was found in South China than those in North China for both subtypes of stroke. Economic loss due to excess YLL from ischaemic stroke related to NO2 exposure was higher than that for haemorrhagic stroke. Our study indicated higher association and economic loss of ischaemic than haemorrhagic stroke related to NO2 exposure in China, which informed priorities for type-specific stroke prevention strategies related to NO2 pollution and vulnerable population protection.","Li, Jie; Huang, Jing; Wang, Yuxin; Yin, Peng; Wang, Lijun; Liu, Yang; Pan, Xiaochuan; Zhou, Maigeng; Li, Guoxing",Ecotoxicol Environ Saf,661,30

We use both a mean-field approximation and Monte Carlo simulations to analyze the dynamics of the model. Information diffusion influences behavior change by allowing people to be aware of the disease and adopt self-protection and subsequently affects disease transmission by changing the actual infection rate. Results show that (a) awareness plays a central role in epidemic prevention, (b) a reasonable fraction of overreacting nodes are needed in epidemic prevention (c) the basic reproduction number R_{0} has different effects on epidemic outbreak for cases with and without asymptomatic infection, and (d) social influence on behavior change can remarkably decrease the epidemic outbreak size. This research indicates that the media and opinion leaders should not understate the transmissibility and severity of diseases to ensure that people become aware of the disease and adopt self-protection to protect themselves and the whole population.","Ye, Yang; Zhang, Qingpeng; Ruan, Zhongyuan; Cao, Zhidong; Xuan, Qi; Zeng, Daniel Dajun",Phys Rev E,661,7

Also, after the number of infections had declined, intensive care beds were kept free prophylactically; however, the percentage of beds reserved for COVID-19 differ in the individual federal states in Germany. The aim of this article is to define a necessary clearance quota of intensive beds for COVID-19 patients in Germany. An escalation and de-escalation scheme was created for rising and falling numbers of infected patients. METHODS: Data from the COVID-19 resource board of the state of Baden-Württemberg, the daily situation report of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), the register of COVID-19 intensive care beds of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) as well as the daily report of COVID-19 Baden-Württemberg from April to November 2020 were used for the calculation. RESULTS: At the end of November 2020 approximately 13.5% of intensive care beds in Germany were used by COVID-19 patients. Of all persons tested positive for SARS-CoV­2, 1.5% were admitted to an intensive care unit. The hospitalization rate was 6% and the mean age of infected persons was 43 years. Based on these numbers hospitals are recommended to keep 10% of intensive care beds available for COVID-19 patients in the case of less than 35 new infections/100,000 in the catchment area, 20% should be kept free in case of an advanced warning level of 35 new infections/100,000 inhabitants and 30% for a critical limit of 50 new infections/100,000 inhabitants. Further internal hospital triggers, such as the occupancy of the intensive care beds with COVID-19 patients, should be considered. CONCLUSION: If the number of infections is low a general nationwide retention rate of more than 10% of intensive care beds for COVID-19 patients is not justified. Locally increasing numbers of infections require a local dynamic approach. If the number of infections increases, the free holding capacity should be increased according to a step by step concept in close coordination with the local health authorities and other internal hospital triggers. In order not to overwhelm hospital capacities in the event of local outbreaks, a corresponding relocation concept should be considered at an early stage.","Pfenninger, E G; Faust, J-O; Klingler, W; Fessel, W; Schindler, S; Kaisers, U X",Anaesthesist,661,16

Gender-blind programs are known to augment harms associated with violence and structural stigmatization by reinforcing rather than challenging unequal systems of power. The intersecting marginalization of these populations with systems of class, race, and settler-colonialism is exacerbating the impact that policies such as physical distancing, school closures, and a realignment of healthcare priorities are having on the wellbeing of these populations. The overarching reasons why women and SGM are marginalized are well known and stem from a hegemonic, patriarchal system that fails to fully integrate these groups into planning and decision making regarding public health programming-including the response to COVID-19. In this perspective, we aim to highlight how the exclusion of cisgender women and SGM, and failure to use a gender redistributive/transformative approach, has (i) hampered the recovery from the pandemic and (ii) further entrenched the existing power structures that lead to the marginalization of these groups. We also argue that COVID-19 represents a once-in-a-century opportunity to realign priorities regarding health promotion for cisgender women and SGM by using gender redistributive/transformative approaches to the recovery from the pandemic. We apply this framework, which aims to challenge the existing power structures and distribution of resources, to exemplars from programs in health, housing, employment, and incarceration to envision how a gender redistributive/transformative approach could harness the COVID-19 recovery to advance health equity for cisgender women and SGM.","Perri, Melissa; Metheny, Nick; Matheson, Flora I; Potvin, Kelly; O039,; Campo, Patricia",Health promot. internation,661,26

Severity of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is likely associated with the infectious dose of SARS-CoV-2 exposure. We therefore aimed to assess the association between SARS-CoV-2 exposure within households and COVID-19 severity. METHODS: We performed a Danish nationwide register-based cohort study including laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals from 22 February to 6 October 2020. Household exposure to SARS-CoV-2 was defined as having one individual tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 within the household. Cox proportional-hazards models were used to estimate the association between 'critical COVID-19' within and between households with and without secondary cases. RESULTS: From 15,063 multi-person households, 19,773 SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals were included; 11,632 were categorized as index cases without any secondary household cases, 3,431 as index cases with secondary cases, i.e. 22.8% of multi-person households, and 4,710 as secondary cases. 'Critical COVID-19' occurred in 2.9 % of index cases living with no secondary cases, 4.9 % of index cases with secondary cases, and 1.3 % of secondary cases.

To our knowledge, no other systematic review has assessed this broad topic. DESIGN: Systematic review of all studies investigating the use of telemedicine in the provision of gynaecological care and education. The search for eligible studies followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and focused on three online databases: PubMed, Science Direct and SciFinder. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Only studies within gynaecology were considered for this review. Studies covering only obstetrics and with minimal information on gynaecology, or clinical medicine in general were excluded. All English language, peer-reviewed human studies were included. Relevant studies published up to the date of final submission of this review were considered with no restrictions to the publication year. DATA EXTRACTIONS AND SYNTHESIS: Data extracted included author details, year of publication and country of the study, study aim, sample size, methodology, sample characteristics, outcome measures and a summary of findings. Data extraction and qualitative assessment were performed by the first author and crossed checked by the second author. Quality assessment for each study was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. RESULTS: A literature search carried out in August 2020 yielded 313 records published between 1992 and 2018. Following a rigorous selection process, only 39 studies were included for this review published between 2000 and 2018. Of these, 19 assessed gynaecological clinical practice, eight assessed gynaecological education, one both, and 11 investigated the feasibility of telemedicine within gynaecological practice. 19 studies were classified as good, 12 fair and eight poor using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Telecolposcopy and abortion care were two areas where telemedicine was found to be effective in potentially speeding up diagnosis as well as providing patients with a wide range of management options. Studies focusing on education demonstrated that telementoring could improve teaching in a range of scenarios such as live surgery and international teleconferencing. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this review are promising and demonstrate that telemedicine has a role to play in improving clinical effectiveness and education within gynaecology. Its applications have been shown to be safe and effective in providing remote care and training. In the future, randomised controlled studies involving larger numbers of patients and operators with measurable outcomes are required in order to be able to draw reliable conclusions.","Murugesu, Sughashini; Galazis, Nicolas; Jones, Benjamin P; Chan, Maxine; Bracewell-Milnes, Timothy; Ahmed-Salim, Yousra; Grewal, Karen; Timmerman, Dirk; Yazbek, Joseph; Bourne, Tom; Saso, Srdjan",BMJ Open,661,16

DESIGN: Prospective, descriptive study. METHOD: The registry focused on atypical symptoms and co-infections. We hypothesized that patients older than 70 years more often have atypical symptoms. The number of co-infections is unknown. Therefore, we prospectively registered medical history, duration of symptoms, symptoms, temperature, lab results and co-infections of patients with confirmed COVID-19 in the period March 4-16th. RESULTS: The clinical characteristics of 107 patients were registered. The average age was 71 years and 41% was female. The median duration of symptoms was 5 days. 19% of patients had not been referred to pulmonary or internal medicine. Symptoms were fever (78%), respiratory complaints (78%), chest pain (28%), abdominal pain (13%), and diarrhea (34%). In 54% of the COVID-19 patients at the ED, the temperature was &#8805; 38,0°C, CRP &#8805; 50 in 51%, leucocytosis in 12% and elevated LD in 61%. Of 31 patients 24 (77%) had an absolute lymphopenia. Co-infections were seen in 16% of patients. The mortality in the ED was 2% and ICU-admission 5%. On March 25th, 2020 the overall mortality was 22% and ICU-admission 15%. CONCLUSION: We have seen patients with a very serious disease resulting in a high mortality and ICU-admission. Over 35% of patient did not have the typical symptoms of fever and respiratory complaints; atypical symptoms like chest pain, abdominal pain and diarrhea are frequently seen. There is no difference between patients over and under 70 years.

Disruption in antenatal care (ANC) provisions during lockdown is expected due to diversion of public health facilities on pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To assess the proportion of pregnant women who had not completed the ideal number of antenatal visits, availability of iron-folic acid (IFA) supplements and challenges in availing health services during the period of lockdown. METHODS: A concurrent mixed-methods study was conducted among pregnant women in Puducherry, India. Information on obstetric characteristics and details regarding antenatal visits were collected through telephonic interviews. In-depth interviews were conducted to understand the perceived challenges in availing health services during the lockdown period. RESULTS: Out of 150 pregnant women, 62 [41.3%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 33.6-49.3] did not complete the ideal number of visits and 61 (40.7%, 95% CI 32.7-49.0) developed health problems. Out of 44 women who received medical care for health problems, 11 (25%) used teleconsultation. Of all the women, 13 (8.7%, 95% CI 4.9-14.0) had not taken the IFA supplements as prescribed by the health provider. Economic hardship, restricted mobility, lack of information about the health system changes and psychological stress due to the fear of COVID were the challenges in accessing care. CONCLUSIONS: Two out of five pregnant women did not complete the ideal number of visits and developed health problems during the lockdown period.","Ulaganeethi, Revathi; Dorairajan, Gowri; Ramaswamy, Gomathi; Thekkur, Pruthu; Olickal, Jeby Jose; Rajkumari, Nonika; Kumar Saya, Ganesh",,661,16

Methods: Using a sample of adults in the 1999 to 2016 National Health Interview Survey (N = 419,336), we examined changes in labor force and economic outcomes by mental health and physical disability status. We employed difference-in-differences analyses to determine whether the changes in these outcomes during and after the recession for each comparison group (those with moderate mental illness, serious psychiatric disability, or physical disability) were significantly different from the changes for persons with neither a mental illness nor a disability. Findings: While the recession impacted all groups, those with mental illnesses or physical disabilities were hardest hit. Persons with disabilities were disadvantaged on all outcomes at each period, but persons with mental illnesses were the most disadvantaged. Unemployment, poverty, and use of food stamps increased for all groups, but the increase was greatest for persons with mental health problems who also saw a more substantial decline in wage income. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: The effects of the recession persist well after the recovery period. Practitioners should be aware that although most persons with mental illnesses want to work, they face significant barriers to employment. Following economic shocks such as those brought on by the current coronavirus pandemic, interventions should focus on people who are the most vulnerable, especially those with mental health problems. Renewed focus on employment for people with mental disorders is important. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).","McAlpine, Donna D; Alang, Sirry M",,661,5

A total of 312 (male = 141;female = 171) registered students were conveniently sampled and completed an online survey questionnaire. Thematically analysed data revealed that student education and health have been impacted since the COVID-19 nationwide lockdown. Participants went on to recommend several measures which, if implemented, could improve their well-being and access to education. Study findings imply that students from previously disadvantaged universities, who in their majority are from impoverished rural communities, have been struggling to access remote learning due to amongst others, the lack of information and communication technology (ICT) devices and network connectivity problems. It, therefore, requires rural-based universities to work together with the government and the private sector and join hands in addressing student challenges and needs during the on-going lockdown in the country.

Here we present a highly effective small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutic against SARS-CoV-2 infection using a novel lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery system. Multiple siRNAs targeting highly conserved regions of the SARS-CoV-2 virus were screened, and three candidate siRNAs emerged that effectively inhibit the virus by greater than 90% either alone or in combination with one another. We simultaneously developed and screened two novel LNP formulations for the delivery of these candidate siRNA therapeutics to the lungs, an organ that incurs immense damage during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Encapsulation of siRNAs in these LNPs followed by in vivo injection demonstrated robust repression of virus in the lungs and a pronounced survival advantage to the treated mice. Our LNP-siRNA approaches are scalable and can be administered upon the first sign of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.

The following keywords were used: ((COVID-19) OR (SARS-CoV-2)) AND ((((((therapeutics) OR (treatment)) OR (vaccine)) OR (hydroxychloroquine)) OR (antiviral)) OR (prognosis)). Results included peer-reviewed studies published in English. RESULTS: 15 peer-reviewed articles met study inclusion criteria, of which 14 were RCTs and one was a systematic review with meta-analysis. The following pharmacologic therapies were evaluated: chloroquine (CQ), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), antivirals therapies, plasma therapy, anti-inflammatories, and a vaccine. CONCLUSION: According to level 1 evidence reviewed here, the most effective SARS-Co-V-2 pharmacologic treatments include remdesivir for mild to severe disease, and a triple regimen therapy consisting of lopinavir-ritonavir, ribavirin and interferon beta-1b for mild to moderate disease. Also, dexamethasone significantly reduced mortality in those requiring respiratory support. However, there is still a great need for detailed level 1 evidence on pharmacologic therapies.","Baroutjian, Amanda; Sanchez, Carol; Boneva, Dessy; McKenney, Mark; Elkbuli, Adel",Am. j. emerg. med,661,20

Understanding viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 is critical for development of effective treatments. An Immune-Viral Dynamics Model (IVDM) is developed to describe SARS-CoV-2 viral dynamics and COVID-19 disease progression. A dataset of 60 individual patients with COVID-19 with clinical viral load (VL) and reported disease severity were assembled from literature. Viral infection and replication mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2, viral-induced cell death, and time-dependent immune response are incorporated in the model to describe the dynamics of viruses and immune response. Disease severity are tested as a covariate to model parameters. The IVDM was fitted to the data and parameters were estimated using the nonlinear mixed-effect model. The model can adequately describe individual viral dynamics profiles, with disease severity identified as a covariate on infected cell death rate. The modeling suggested that it takes about 32.6 days to reach 50% of maximum cell-based immunity. Simulations based on virtual populations suggested a typical mild case reaches VL limit of detection (LOD) by 13 days with no treatment, a moderate case by 17 days, and a severe case by 41 days. Simulations were used to explore hypothetical treatments with different initiation time, disease severity, and drug effects to demonstrate the usefulness of such modeling in informing decisions. Overall, the IVDM modeling and simulation platform enables simulations for viral dynamics and treatment efficacy and can be used to aid in clinical pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) and dose-efficacy response analysis for COVID-19 drug development.","Cao, Youfang; Gao, Wei; Caro, Luzelena; Stone, Julie A",Clinical and translational science (Online),661,1

The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of government mandated school closures, stay at home orders and mask requirements METHODS: Cumulative incidence rates were calculated at 14-day intervals until the day of the first vaccine administration in the country. Rate ratios were calculated using negative binomial regression while investigating the effects of adjusting for several sociodemographic and medical factors RESULTS: Faster implementation of mask mandates was consistently shown to be protective. States with mask mandates made at three to six months had a 1.61 times higher rate than those who implemented within one month (adjusted rate ratioâ¯=â¯1.61, 95% confidence interval: 1.23-2.10, P = .001). States with mask mandates made after 6 months or with no mandate had a 2.16 times higher rate than those who implemented within 1 month (adjusted rate ratioâ¯=â¯2.16, 95% confidence interval: 1.64-2.88, P < .0001). In contrast, both stay at home orders and school closures had no significant influence on disease trajectory. DISCUSSION: The benefits of mask mandates are apparent, especially when mandates were issued within a month. The impact of school closing and stay at home orders were less clear. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that of the different physical distancing measures implemented by the government, mask mandates are the most important.","Krishnamachari, Bhuma; Morris, Alexander; Zastrow, Diane; Dsida, Andrew; Harper, Brian; Santella, Anthony J",Am. j. infect. control,661,24

We predicted that participants expressing heightened perceived vulnerability to disease and greater levels of conservatism would report higher levels of aversion towards targets not wearing a mask, particularly among Asian targets, given the association of COVID-19 with Asian populations. Results indicate that conservative individuals were more comfortable with both Asian and White targets if they were not wearing a mask, particularly male targets. We contextualize these findings by identifying how mask-wearing during the pandemic could be more communicative of one's coalitional affiliation rather than a protective health measure for more conservative persons.","Boykin, Kaitlyn; Brown, Mitch; Macchione, Alicia L; Drea, Kelsey M; Sacco, Donald F",Evol Psychol Sci,661,11

The presence of target RNA firstly triggers the catalytic hairpin assembly circuit and then initiates terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated DNA polymerization. Consequently, a large number of long single-stranded DNA products can be produced, and these negatively charged DNA products will bind a massive of positively charged electroactive molecular of Ru(NH3)63+ due to the electrostatic adsorption. Therefore, significantly amplified electrochemical signals can be generated for sensitive analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the range of 0.1-1000 pM with the detection limit as low as 26 fM. Besides the excellent distinguishing ability for SARS-CoV-2 RNA against single-base mismatched RNA, the proposed biosensor can also be successfully applied to complex matrices, as well as clinical patient samples with high stability, which shows great prospects of clinical application.","Peng, Ying; Pan, Yanhong; Sun, Zhaowei; Li, Jinlong; Yi, Yongxiang; Yang, Jie; Li, Genxi",Biosens Bioelectron,661,5

Since then, it has becoming increasingly clear that physical distancing will need to be prolonged in the 2020/2021 school year and possibly resumed in the future. In response, education ministries shifted teaching and learning online. Research is urgently needed to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 on teaching and learning, particularly in the foundational early primary years. This research directly responds to this concern by examining the unique challenges associated with remote teaching and learning in early primary contexts. Given that learning in kindergarten and early primary grades is largely play- and inquiry- based, there is a particular need to investigate the impacts of this move for teachers, parents, and children in K-2. As such, the purpose of this research is twofold: (1) to capture the unique challenges and unanticipated successes associated with remote teaching and learning, and (2) to utilize findings to provide recommendations for remote learning as well as strategies for supporting in-person learning in the COVID-19 era (and post COVID-19 era). Data collection included 45-min semi-structured interviews with K-2 teachers (n = 25) and parents (n =11). All participants were from Ontario Canada. Data were collected from April-June 2020. The sample size was chosen to ensure saturation while uncovering a variety of perspectives. Data were analyzed in NVivo using an emergent thematic approach (Patton, 2016). The emergent thematic approach to analysis revealed five themes: equity considerations, synchronous versus asynchronous teaching and learning, social and emotional effects on students, academic impacts, and effects on parents/families.","Timmons, Kristy; Cooper, Amanda; Bozek, Emma; Braund, Heather",Early Child Educ J,661,16

There are about ten lineages of photosynthetic eukaryotes, including Chloroplastida, Rhodophyta, and Cryptophyta. Mechanistically, eukaryotic photosynthesis arose via a symbiotic merger between a host eukaryote and either a cyanobacterial or eukaryotic photosymbiont. There are, however, many aspects of this major evolutionary transition that remain unsettled. The field, so far, has been dominated by proposals formulated following the principle of parsimony, such as the Archaeplastida hypothesis, in which a taxonomic lineage is often conceptually recognized as an individual cell (or a distinct entity). Such an assumption could lead to confusion or unrealistic interpretation of discordant genomic and phenotypic data. Here, we propose that the free-living ancestors to the plastids may have originated from a diversified lineage of cyanobacteria that were prone to symbioses, akin to some modern-day algae such as the Symbiodiniaceae dinoflagellates and Chlorella-related algae that associate with a number of unrelated host eukaryotes. This scenario, which assumes the plurality of ancestral form, better explains relatively minor but important differences that are observed in the genomes of modern-day eukaryotic algal species. Such a non-typological (or population-aware) way of thinking seems to better-model empirical data, such as discordant phylogenies between plastid and host eukaryote genes.","Maruyama, Shinichiro; Kim, Eunsoo",Results Probl Cell Differ,661,29

METHODS: Single-center retrospective cohort study of adult HCT recipients with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. RESULTS: Twenty-eight consecutive transplantation and cellular therapy patients (autologous, n = 12; allogeneic, n = 15; chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy [CAR-T], n = 1) with COVID-19 were identified. The median age was 57 years. The median time from HCT to COVID-19 diagnosis was 656 days (interquartile range [IQR], 33-1274). Patients were followed for a median of 59 days (IQR, 40-88). Among assessable patients (n = 19), 10 (53%) had documented virological clearance; median time to clearance was 34 days (range, 21-56). Out of 28, 12 (43%), 6 (21%), and 10 (36%) patients had mild, moderate, and severe/critical disease, respectively. Overall mortality was 25%, nearly identical for autologous and allogeneic HCT, and exclusively seen in hospitalized patients, older than 50 years of age with severe COVID-19. None of the patients with mild (n = 12) or moderate (n = 6) COVID-19 died whereas 7/10 patients (70%) with severe/critical COVID-19 died (P = .0001). Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 within 12 months of HCT exhibited higher mortality (57% vs 14%; P = .04). All-cause 30-day mortality (n = 4) was 14%. A higher proportion of patients who died within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis (3/4) were receiving &#8805;2 immunosuppressants, compared with patients who survived beyond 30 days after COVID-19 diagnosis (2/24; 75% vs. 8%; P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: Mortality in COVID-19 HCT patients is higher than that of the age-comparable general population and largely dependent on age, disease severity, timing from HCT, and intensity of immunosuppression.","Camargo, Jose F; Mendoza, Maria A; Lin, Rick; Moroz, Ilona V; Anderson, Anthony D; Morris, Michelle I; Natori, Yoichiro; Natori, Akina; Raja, Mohammed; Lekakis, Lazaros; Beitinjaneh, Amer; Jimenez, Antonio; Goodman, Mark; Wang, Trent; Komanduri, Krishna V; Pereira, Denise",Transpl Infect Dis,661,16

Our paper attends to this gap by exploring the mental health of physicians in Bangladesh during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is particularly important since the mental health of physicians impacts not only on themselves, but also their professional performance and hence the care of patients. This study examined physicians' mental health outcomes by evaluating the prevalence and associated potential risk factors of anxiety and depression. Using a web-based cross-sectional survey, we collected data from 114 physicians. Seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale and Nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) were used to measure the anxiety and depression, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to explore the potential risk factors related to anxiety and depression. The prevalence of anxiety and depression were 32.5 and 34.2%, respectively. Findings revealed that marital status, work per day and current job location were the main risk factors for anxiety while sex, age, and marital status were the main risk factors for depression. Our results highlight the need to implement policies and strategies for positively impacting the mental health of physicians during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Khatun, Most Farida; Parvin, Most Firoza; Rashid, Md Mamun-Ur; Alam, Md Shah; Kamrunnahar, Most; Talukder, Ashis; Rahman Razu, Shaharior; Ward, Paul R; Ali, Mohammad",Front Public Health,661,21

We problematise the idea of a nexus by undertaking a critical examination of the concept through the lens of educational ideologies to theorise the changes over time that shape the ways teaching and research are practised. Two hundred seven academic staff in the Humanities and Social Sciences were surveyed in 10 universities in England and Wales; the universities were identified as having strength in teaching, research, or in both. Along with analysis of interviews with senior managers at these universities, findings suggest that systemic forces which separate teaching and research are evident in institutional contexts with implications for the idea of a nexus. While the nexus may exist in theory, in practice, we argue that teaching and research can be pulled in different directions by institutional priorities. Furthermore, in institutions which adopt an enterprise ideology, there are signs of a nascent nexus emerging between research and innovation.","McKinley, Jim; McIntosh, Shona; Milligan, Lizzi; Mikolajewska, Agata",High Educ (Dordr),661,16

Findings: 15,586 individuals tested for COVID-19 at the Cleveland Clinic between March 8, 2020 and May 13, 2020 met our inclusion criteria. 12.4% of COPD patients (164/1319) tested positive for COVID-19 compared to 16.6% (2363/14,267) of the non-COPD population. 48.2% (79/164) of COVID-19 positive COPD patients required hospitalization and 45.6% (36/79) required ICU admission. After adjustment for covariates, rates of COVID-19 infection were not significantly different than the non-COPD population (adj OR 0.97; CI: 0.89-1.05), but COPD patients had increased healthcare utilization as demonstrated by risk for hospitalization (adj OR 1.36; CI: 1.15-1.60), ICU admission (OR 1.20; CI: 1.02-1.40), and need for invasive mechanical ventilation (adj OR 1.49; CI: 1.28-1.73). Unadjusted risk for in-hospital mortality was higher in the COPD population (OR 1.51; CI: 1.14-1.96). After adjusting for covariates however, the risk for in-hospital mortality was not significantly different than the non-COPD population (adj OR 1.08: CI: 0.81-1.42).

RESULTS: A total of 113 patients (61.9% males, 38.1% females) with a mean age of 72.3â¯±â¯14.2 presented during March/April 2019 with ACS (STEMI + NSTEMI) while only 67 (70.1% males, 29.9% females) COVID-19 negative patients with a mean age of 65.1â¯±â¯14.5 presented during the same period (March/April) in 2020. This is a drop by 40.7% (Pâ¯<â¯.05) of total ACS cases during the COVID-19 pandemic. In NSTEMI patients, 36.4% presented late (>24 hours of symptoms) during the COVID-19 pandemic in comparison with 2019 (27.1%, Pâ¯=â¯.033). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic led to a substantial drop by 40.7% (Pâ¯<â¯.05) of total ACS admissions in our area. This decrease in hospital admissions and late presentations can be a worrisome sign for an increase in future complications of myocardial infarctions.","Braiteh, Nabil; Rehman, Wajeeh Ur; Alom, Md; Skovira, Vincent; Breiteh, Nour; Rehman, Ibraheem; Yarkoni, Alon; Kahsou, Hisham; Rehman, Afzal",Am Heart J,661,23

However, how SARS-CoV-2 interferes with host immune response is incompletely understood. Here, we sequenced small RNAs from SARS-CoV-2-infected human cells and identified a micro-RNA (miRNA) encoded in a recently evolved region of the viral genome. We show that the virus-encoded miRNA produces two miRNA isoforms in infected cells by the enzyme Dicer and they are loaded into Argonaute proteins. Moreover, the predominant miRNA isoform targets the 3UTR of interferon-stimulated genes and represses their expression in a miRNA-like fashion. Finally, the two viral miRNA isoforms were detected in nasopharyngeal swabs from COVID-19 patients. We propose that SARS-CoV-2 employs a virus-encoded miRNA to hijack the host miRNA machinery and evade the interferon-mediated immune response.","Singh, Meetali; Chazal, Maxime; Quarato, Piergiuseppe; Bourdon, Loan; Malabat, Christope; Vallet, Thomas; Vignuzzi, Marco; Werf, Sylvie van der; Behillil, Sylvie; Donati, Flora; Sauvonnet, Nathalie; Nigro, Giulia; Bourgine, Maryline; Jouvenet, Nolwenn; Cecere, Germano",,661,16

Yet invisible obstacles or barriers appear to impede mass adoption of these services among this population group. The aim of the current research is to provide a qualitative picture of these invisible obstacles and to profile their main features, with special attention to the role of family members in supporting OHS use among this population group. METHODS: This qualitative study entailed a series of in-depth, semi-structured, open phone interviews conducted with 31 individuals age 50 and up in Israel, who constituted a sample of OHS users and non-users among older adults. RESULTS: Four major themes and primary observations emerge from our data: 1. While older adults are aware of OHS to some extent, they often do not fully understand the specific benefits of using these services; 2. Older adults need to acquire much more experience with OHS use. OHS user interfaces still have a long way to go for older adults to feel comfortable using them. People age 50 and up seem to be less concerned about privacy and security issues than about seemingly more trivial issues such as recovering forgotten passwords; 3. Family members can play key roles in helping older adults adopt OHS by providing technical support as well as encouragement; 4. Older adults have worthwhile recommendations for innovations and policy improvements that would facilitate wider adoption of OHS. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study reveal important nuances regarding the importance of awareness, user interface and experience for OHS use among older adults, as well as the critical role of family members in OHS adoption. Based on these findings, we recommend the following: expanding advertising on media channels to emphasize the benefits of OHS use; improving HMO websites to make them more user-friendly for older people; developing HMO-run community OHS guidance programs geared to older people to reduce the gap between required skills and user competencies, thus enabling older people to benefit from OHS use.","Mizrachi, Y; Shahrabani, S; Nachmani, M; Hornik, A",Isr J Health Policy Res,661,16

Most countries are expected to fail to protect >90% of their available climate at current levels. The evenness of climatic representation under protection-not the amount of area protected-positively influenced the retention of climatic conditions under protection. On average, protection retention would increase by ~118% if countries doubled their climatic representativeness under protection or by ~102% if countries collectively reduced emissions in accordance with global targets.

Popular strategies for mitigating misinformation include crowdsourcing, machine learning, and media literacy programs that require social media users to classify news in binary terms as either true or false. However, research on peer influence suggests that framing decisions in binary terms can amplify judgment errors and limit social learning, whereas framing decisions in probabilistic terms can reliably improve judgments. In this preregistered experiment, we compare online peer networks that collaboratively evaluated the veracity of news by communicating either binary or probabilistic judgments. Exchanging probabilistic estimates of news veracity substantially improved individual and group judgments, with the effect of eliminating polarization in news evaluation. By contrast, exchanging binary classifications reduced social learning and maintained polarization. The benefits of probabilistic social learning are robust to participants' education, gender, race, income, religion, and partisanship.","Guilbeault, Douglas; Woolley, Samuel; Becker, Joshua",PLoS One,661,30

Most patients suffer from bilateral cataract and while cataract surgery of only one eye is effective in restoring functional vision, second-eye surgery leads to further improvements in health-related quality of life, and is cost-effective. At present, most patients undergo cataract surgery in both eyes on separate days as recommended in national guidelines, referred to as delayed sequential bilateral cataract surgery (DSBCS). An alternative procedure involves operating both eyes on the same day, but as separate procedures, known as immediately sequential bilateral cataract surgery (ISBCS). The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and costs of ISBCS compared to DSBCS, in order to test the hypothesis that ISBCS is non-inferior to DSBCS in terms of effectiveness and superior to ISBCS in terms of cost-effectiveness. METHODS/DESIGN: Multicenter non-inferiority randomised controlled clinical trial. Patients (18 years or older) with bilateral cataract and an indication for bilateral cataract surgery with an expected uncomplicated intraoperative and postoperative course are included in the study. Patients are randomly assigned to either ISBCS or DSBCS. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients with a refractive outcome in the second eye within 1.0 dioptre from the target refraction, at 4 weeks after surgery. Secondary outcomes include corrected and uncorrected distance visual acuity, complications, patient reported outcomes (PROMs), cost-effectiveness, and budget impact. Follow-up visits are planned at 1 week after first-eye surgery and 4 weeks after second-eye surgery. At 3 months after first-eye surgery, the occurrence of complications is checked and patients fill in a final questionnaire. DISCUSSION: This study protocol describes the design of a multicenter non-inferiority randomised controlled trial. Current studies on ISBCS often lack information on safety regarding refractive outcomes. In addition, there is a lack of well-designed cost-effectiveness studies using established methods. The BICAT-NL study will provide more insight in refractive and cost-effectiveness outcomes for ISBCS compared to DSBCS.

We focus on a deterministic susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model, which is one of the well-known, fundamental models that capture the epidemic spreading. The event-triggered control is particularly formulated in the context of viral spreading, in which control inputs (e.g., the amount of medical treatments, a level of traffic regulations) for each subpopulation are updated only when the fraction of the infected people in the subpopulation exceeds a prescribed threshold. We analyze stability of the proposed event-triggered controller, and derives a sufficient condition for a prescribed control objective to be achieved. Moreover, we propose a novel emulation-based approach towards the design of the event-triggered controller, and show that the problem of designing the event-triggered controller can be solved in polynomial time using geometric programming. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through numerical simulations using an air transportation network.","Hashimoto, Kazumune; Onoue, Yuga; Ogura, Masaki; Ushio, Toshimitsu",,661,16

The systemic neglect in the Australian context has resulted in a rise in demand for the services provided by privately practising midwives (PPMs) that is not matched by systemic support for, nor recognition of, women choosing to birth at home. As a result, PPMs are unable to meet the rise in demand, which in itself reflects decades of limited State support for the choice to birth at home and opposition by incumbent stakeholders in the provision of maternity care to healthy women with low-risk pregnancies. We discuss the historical backdrop to these currently erupting issues, along with the real reasons for the opposition to PPMs in Australia.

Using the combined resources of the Supercomputing Centers at UC San Diego, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and MIT, the spatial temporal structure of anonymized source-destination pairs from the CAIDA Telescope data has been analyzed with GraphBLAS hierarchical hypersparse matrices. These analyses provide unique insight on this unsolicited Internet darkspace traffic with the discovery of many previously unseen scaling relations. The data show a significant sustained increase in unsolicited traffic corresponding to the start of the COVID19 pandemic, but relatively little change in the underlying scaling relations associated with unique sources, source fan-outs, unique links, destination fan-ins, and unique destinations.

METHODS: Urologic trainees and attending physicians at our institution, who are familiar with existing safety recommendations and guidelines regarding the care of infected patients, were queried regarding their experiences to determine an expert consensus on best practices for bedside procedures for SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. RESULTS: Our team developed the following general recommendations for urologic interventions on SARS-CoV-2 positive patients: maximize use of telehealth (even for inpatient consults), minimize in-room time, use personal protective equipment appropriately, enlist a colleague to assist, and acquire all supplies that may be needed and maintain them outside the room. Detailed recommendations were also developed for difficult urethral catheterization, bedside cystoscopy, incision and drainage of abscesses, and gross hematuria/clot irrigations. CONCLUSION: As patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection are predominantly men over 50 years old, there are significant urologic challenges common in this population that have emerged with this pandemic. While there is tremendous variation in how different regions have been affected, the demographics of SARS-CoV-2 mean that urologists will continue to have a unique role in helping to manage these patients. Here, we summarize recommendations for bedside urologic interventions specific to SARS-CoV-2 positive patients based on experiences from a large metropolitan hospital system. Regulations and requirements may differ on an institutional basis, so these guidelines are intended to augment specific local protocols.","Souders, Colby P; Zhao, Hanson; Ackerman, A Lenore",Urology,661,16

With regard to the management of pregnant COVID-19 patients, in addition to the treatment of the infection itself, which is not that different from generally accepted principles, it is interesting to consider which obstetric procedures should be used to minimize the adverse effects on mother and child. Questions arise concerning the continuation of pregnancy, how to terminate the pregnancy, the possibility of virus transmission through the placenta, isolation of the newborn after birth, and breastfeeding. The aim of this study was to review the current state of knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease in pregnant women. Because the epidemic began in China, most of the available literature comes from studies conducted there. The studies used to prepare this review article are the first non-randomized studies containing small groups of examined women. They do not provide clear indications, but show that in an epidemic situation, special care should be taken in pregnancy management, making decisions about termination of pregnancy, and handling of the newborn baby to minimize the risk of subsequent health consequences. Further analysis is needed on the incidence of COVID-19 among pregnant women and its consequences.

METHODS: This research evaluated Italian dentists from 11 to 18 April 2020, using a questionnaire submitted via Google Forms (Alphabet, Mountain View, CA, USA). It consisted of different investigations about sociodemographic aspects, profession-related characteristics, knowledge about COVID-19 infection transmission modalities, symptoms, and attitude in treating potentially infected patients. Statistical analysis was performed using the Pearson chi2 test and Student t-test. The &#945;-level was fixed at p = 0.05. All data were analyzed with STATA 16 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA). RESULTS: 1500 dentists (664 men and 836 women) completed the questionnaire. The majority of respondents declared having been trained in infection prevention procedures (64.3%) but not specifically to prevent the spread of COVID-19 (48.7%). A total of 57.2% declared that they were not trained sufficiently to restart working after lockdown, with a significantly higher prevalence (Pearson chi2 test, p < 0.001) among women (62.3%) than men (50.9%). CONCLUSION: Italian dentists were informed correctly on the mode of transmission but partially missed COVID-19 symptoms. Dentists considered the virus infection highly dangerous, and they were not confident in being able to work safely.

Some anticancer treatments have been reported to have negative influences on COVID-19-infected patients while other studies did not support this hypothesis. METHODS: A literature search was conducted in WOS, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, CNKI and VIP between Dec 1, 2019 and Sept 23, 2020 for studies on anticancer treatments in patients with COVID-19. Cohort studies involving over 20 patients with cancer were included. The characteristics of the patients and studies, treatment types, mortality, and other additional outcomes were extracted and pooled for synthesis. RRs and forest plots were adopted to present the results. The literature quality and publication bias were assessed using NOS and Egger's test, respectively. RESULTS: We analyzed the data from 29 studies, with 5121 cancer patients with COVID-19 meeting the inclusion criteria. There were no significant differences in mortality between patients receiving anticancer treatment and those not (RR 1.17, 95%CI: 0.96-1.43, I2 =66%, p = 0.12). Importantly, in patients with hematological malignancies, chemotherapy could markedly increase the mortality (RR 2.68, 95% CI: 1.90-3.78, I2 =0%, p < 0.00001). In patients with solid tumors, no significant differences in mortality were observed (RR 1.16, 95% CI: 0.57-2.36, I2 =72%, p = 0.67). In addition, our analysis revealed that anticancer therapies had no effects on the ICU admission rate (RR 0.87, 95% CI: 0.70-1.09, I2 =25%, p = 0.23), the severe rate (RR 1.04, 95% CI: 0.95-1.13, I2 =31%, p = 0.42), or respiratory support rate (RR 0.92, 95% CI: 0.70-1.21, I2 =32%, p = 0.55) in COVID-19-infected patients with cancer. Notably, patients receiving surgery had a higher rate of respiratory support than those without any antitumor treatment (RR 1.87, 95%CI: 1.02-3.46, I2 =0%, p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: No significant difference was seen in any anticancer treatments in the solid tumor subgroup. Chemotherapy, however, will lead to higher mortality in patients with hematological malignancies.

Our results revealed that FA pre-treatment for 24 hours can reverse cell loss of H2 O2 -induced ARPE-19 cells via the promotion of cell proliferation and prevention of apoptosis, as evidenced by 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labelling (TUNEL) assay, respectively. Moreover, the addition of FA (5 mM) can decrease Bax and cleaved caspase-3 protein expression, but increase Bcl-2 protein expression in ARPE-19 cells. Furthermore, H2 O2 -induced oxidative stress in ARPE-19 cells was significantly alleviated by FA, illustrated by reduced levels of ROS and MDA. In addition, the attenuated antioxidant enzymes activities of (SOD, CAT and GPX) and GSH level were reversed almost to the normal base level by the pre-addition of FA for 24 hours. In all assays, FA itself did not exert any effect on the change of the above parameters. These novel findings indicated that FA effectively protected human ARPE-19 cells from H2 O2 -induced oxidative damage through its pro-proliferation, anti-apoptosis and antioxidant activity, suggesting that FA has a therapeutic potential in the prevention and treatment of AMD.","Xie, Kunpeng; Jin, Bo; Zhu, Haiyan; Zhou, Pengyi; Du, Liping; Jin, Xuemin",J. cell. mol. med,661,16

The results were subjected to multivariate analysis to identify the influence of sex, the degree being pursued, and ‘course year’. The number of students vaccinated against influenza in the campaign preceding the present study was also recorded, as were the factors that influenced decision-making in this regard. A total of 934 students completed the questionnaire. Their beliefs regarding vaccination were positive (mean score 3.23 points out of 4), as was their behaviour (3.35/4). Their general attitude (all variables taken together) was therefore also good (3.27/4). Only 26.8% of the students had been vaccinated against influenza. Beliefs scores among the students of nursing in their more senior course years were significantly better than those recorded for all other groups. These students also showed the best general attitude towards vaccination and formed the largest group vaccinated against influenza.

Symptoms of Kawasaki disease in general and incomplete Kawasaki disease have been seen in a subset of pediatric patients having a current or previous infection of SARS-CoV-2. A viral infection, such as a SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, could result in extensive antigen-antibody immune complexes that cannot be quickly cleared in a subset of patients and thus create a type III hypersensitivity immune reaction and cause Kawasaki disease or Kawasaki disease symptoms (also known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome) in a subset of patients. Extensive binding of antibodies to viral antigens can create antigen-antibody immune complexes, which, if not eliminated in certain individuals having dysfunctional complement systems, can start inflammatory type III hypersensitivity symptoms, including protease releases that can disrupt epithelium, mesothelium, and endothelium basement membranes, and induce pervasive inflammation throughout the body. This could continue after SARS-CoV-2 infections end if the first wave of protease attacks on basement membranes created new secondary autoantibodies and new uncleared antigen-antibody immune complexes.","Roe, Kevin",Inflammopharmacology,661,1

We developed two novel mammogram-based breast cancer risk measures based on image brightness (Cirrocumulus) and texture (Cirrus). Their risk prediction when fitted together, and with an established measure of conventional mammographic density (Cumulus), is not known. We used three studies consisting of: 168 interval cases and 498 matched controls; 422 screen-detected cases and 1,197 matched controls; and 354 younger-diagnosis cases and 944 controls frequency-matched for age at mammogram. We conducted conditional and unconditional logistic regression analyses of individually- and frequency-matched studies, respectively. We estimated measure-specific risk gradients as the change in odds per standard deviation of controls after adjusting for age and body mass index (OPERA) and calculated the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). For interval, screen-detected and younger-diagnosis cancer risks, the best fitting models (OPERAs [95% confidence intervals]) involved: Cumulus (1.81 [1.41 to 2.31]) and Cirrus (1.72 [1.38 to 2.14]); Cirrus (1.49 [1.32 to 1.67]) and Cirrocumulus (1.16 [1.03 to 1.31]); and Cirrus (1.70 [1.48 to 1.94]) and Cirrocumulus (1.46 [1.27 to 1.68]), respectively. The AUCs were: 0.73 [0.68 to 0.77], 0.63 [0.60 to 0.66], and 0.72 [0.69 to 0.75], respectively. Combined, our new mammogram-based measures have twice the risk gradient for screen-detected and younger-diagnosis breast cancer (P<10-12 ), have at least the same discriminatory power as the current polygenic risk score, and are more correlated with causal factors than conventional mammographic density. Discovering more information about breast cancer risk from mammograms could help enable risk-based personalised breast screening.","Nguyen, Tuong L; Schmidt, Daniel F; Makalic, Enes; Maskarinec, Gertraud; Li, Shuai; Dite, Gillian S; Aung, Ye K; Evans, Christopher F; Trinh, Ho N; Baglietto, Laura; Stone, Jennifer; Song, Yun-Mi; Sung, Joohon; MacInnis, Robert J; Dugué, Pierre-Antoine; Dowty, James G; Jenkins, Mark A; Milne, Roger L; Southey, Melissa C; Giles, Graham G; Hopper, John L",Int. j. cancer,661,1

Intervening in adolescence is critical given juxtaposition of increased judgement/fear of judgement and the onset of serious mental illness. This paper details the efforts of an intervention designed to specifically target the perception of dangerousness, social distancing, and use of stigmatizing language. A total of 124 high school freshman participated in the interactive presentation delivered over the course of a typical 40 min class period. An identical survey with a 5-point Likert scale was administered before and after to measure level of agreement with stigmatizing statements. Most participants reported prior exposure through the media (86.6%) and through conversations with family/friends (67.7%). Post intervention, improvement was seen in the perception of dangerousness (MD = 0.45, t = 4.435, p = <0.001), the need for social distancing (measure 1: MD = 0.148, t = 1.785, p = 0.039; measure 2: MD = 0.142, t = 1.773, p = 0.04), and understanding of the experience of those with serious mental illness (MD = 0.377, t = 3.378, p = <0.001). No significant difference was seen in terms of stigmatizing language use (MD = 0.114, t = 1.192, p = 0.118). This study supports the delivery of anti-stigma education to adolescents that avoids the biogenetic and contact approaches, embraces the continuum model of mental health, normalizes psychotic experiences, addresses dangerousness with data, identifies prominent figures with mental illness, and uses personalized statistics to demonstrate why this topic is of importance.","Dillinger, Rachel L",Psychiatr. q,661,1

BACKGROUND: Health professionals caring for patients during infectious outbreaks such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome have reported negative psychological effects. However, little is known about how the experience influences their professional self-image. DESIGN: An interpretive phenomenological approach was applied using individual in-depth interviews. METHODS: Through purposeful and snowball sampling, 11 health professionals who had experienced hospital isolation due to suspicious symptoms of Middle East respiratory syndrome during the outbreak, participated in face-to-face interviews (50-90 min). We adhered to the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research guideline for reporting. RESULTS: Six themes were identified: (a) engulfed in chaos and exhaustion; (b) feeling hurt and constrained by the rejection and blame; (c) anxiety induced by the enclosed environment; (d) dread of this uncertain and critical disease; (e) sustained by family and colleagues; and (f) reflection at this turning point, expanding self-understanding and seeking a balance. CONCLUSION: Hospitalised isolation was a ""turning point"" that appeared to change health professionals' sense of identity and direction.

While some countries are still grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic, others have fared better and have established relative normalcy quickly. The rapid transmission rate of the virus has shown a greater need for efficient and technologically modern containment measures. The use of digital tools to facilitate strict containment measures in countries that have faired well against the COVID-19 pandemic has sparked both interest and controversy. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we compare the precautions taken against the spread of COVID-19, particularly the use of digital tools in contact tracing, and propose policies that could be utilized in the U.S. for future COVID-19 waves or pandemics. METHODS: COVID-19 death rates data were obtained from the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) accessed through the Our World in Data database, and were evaluated based on population size per 100,000 from December 31, 2019 to September 6, 2020. All policies and measures enacted were obtained from their respective governmental websites. RESULTS: We found a strong association between lower death rates per capita and countries that implemented early mask use and strict border control measures that included mandatory quarantine using digital tools. There is a significant difference in the number of deaths per 100,000 when comparing Taiwan, South Korea, and Singapore versus the U.S., Spain, and Italy. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our research, it is evident that early intervention with the use of digital tools has a strong correlation for containing COVID-19. Infection rates and subsequent deaths in Italy, Spain, and more specifically the U.S. could have been much lower with early mask use and, more importantly, timely border control measures utilizing modern digital tools. Thus, we propose that the U.S. execute the following national policies should a public health emergency be declared: (1) Immediately establish a National Command responsible for enacting strict mandatory guidelines enforced by federal and state governments, including national mask use. (2) Mandate civilian cooperation with health officials in contact tracing and quarantine orders. Incoming travelers to the U.S. and those quarantined will be required to download a contact tracing app. We acknowledge the countries we studied differ in their cultures, political systems, and reporting criteria for COVID-19 deaths. Further research may need to be conducted to address these limitations; however, we believe that the proposed policies could protect the American public.","Zeng, Kylie; Bernardo, Stephanie N; Havins, Weldon E",,661,24

OBJECTIVE: We conducted a qualitative study to categorize and describe barriers to teamwork posed by PPE and distancing in the emergency setting. METHODS: We conducted 55 semi-structured interviews between June 2020 and August 2020 with personnel from two emergency departments serving in a variety of roles. We then performed a thematic analysis to identify and construct patterns of teamwork challenges into themes. RESULTS: We discovered two types of challenges to teamwork: material barriers related to wearing masks, gowns and powered air-purifying respirators, and spatial barriers implemented to conserve PPE and limit coronavirus exposure. Both material and spatial barriers resulted in disrupted communication, roles and interpersonal relationships, but they did so in unique ways. Material barriers muffled information flow, impeded team member recognition and role/task division, and reduced belonging and cohesion while increasing interpersonal strain. Spatial barriers resulted in mediated communication and added physical and emotional distance between teammates and patients. CONCLUSION: Our findings identify specific aspects of how intensified PPE use disrupts teamwork and can inform efforts to ensure care quality and safety in emergency settings as PPE use continues during and, potentially beyond, the coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic.","Hayirli, Tuna C; Stark, Nicholas; Bhanja, Aditi; Hardy, James; Peabody, Christopher R; Kerrissey, Michaela J",Int. j. qual. health care,661,23

What follows after the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection depends on the extension and severity of viral attacks in different cell types and organs. Despite the ridiculously large number of papers that have flooded scientific journals and preprint-hosting websites, a clear clinical picture of COVID-19 aftermath is vague at best. Without larger prospective observational studies that are only now being started, clinicians can retrieve information just from case reports and or small studies. This is the time to understand how COVID-19 goes forward and what consequences survivors may expect to experience. To this aim, a multidisciplinary post-acute care service involving several specialists has been established at the Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A. Gemelli IRCSS (Rome, Italy). Although COVID-19 is an infectious disease primarily affecting the lung, its multi-organ involvement requires an interdisciplinary approach encompassing virtually all branches of internal medicine and geriatrics. In particular, during the post-acute phase, the geriatrician may serve as the case manager of a multidisciplinary team. The aim of this article is to describe the importance of the interdisciplinary approach--coordinated by geriatrician--to cope the potential post-acute care needs of recovered COVID-19 patients.",,Aging Clin Exp Res,661,13

Many of these devices are pressure-cycled pneumatic ventilators, which are easy to produce but often do not include the sensing or alarm features found on commercial ventilators. This work reports a low-cost, easy-to-produce electronic sensor and alarm system for pressure-cycled ventilators that estimates clinically useful metrics such as pressure and respiratory rate and sounds an alarm when the ventilator malfunctions. A low-complexity signal processing algorithm uses a pair of nonlinear recursive envelope trackers to monitor the signal from an electronic pressure sensor connected to the patient airway. The algorithm, inspired by those used in hearing aids, requires little memory and performs only a few calculations on each sample so that it can run on nearly any microcontroller.","Corey, Ryan M; Widloski, Evan M; Null, David; Ricconi, Brian; Johnson, Mark A; White, Karen C; Amos, Jennifer R; Pagano, Alexander; Oelze, Michael L; Switzky, Rachel D; Wheeler, Matthew B; Bethke, Eliot B; Shipley, Clifford F; Singer, Andrew C",IEEE Trans Biomed Circuits Syst,661,1

OBJECTIVE: To determine efficacy and safety of the association of IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra plus methylprednisolone in severe COVID-19 pneumonia with hyperinflammation. METHODS: Secondary analysis of prospective observational cohort studies at an Italian tertiary health-care facility. COVID-19 patients consecutively hospitalized (02/25/2020 to 03/30/2020), with hyperinflammation (ferritin &#8805;1000ng/mL and/or C-reactive protein >10mg/dL) and respiratory failure (oxygen therapy from 0.4 FiO2 Venturi mask to invasive mechanical ventilation) were evaluated to investigate the effect of high-dose anakinra plus methylprednisolone on survival. Patients were followed from study inclusion to day 28 or death. Crude and adjusted (sex, age, baseline PaO2:FiO2 ratio, Charlson Index, baseline mechanical ventilation, hospitalization to inclusion lapse) risks were calculated (Cox proportional regression model). RESULTS: 120 COVID-19 patients with hyperinflammation (median age 62 years, 80.0% males, median PaO2:FiO2 ratio 151, 32.5% on mechanical ventilation) were evaluated. Of these, 65 were treated with anakinra and methylprednisolone and 55 were untreated historical controls. At 28 days, mortality was 13.9% in treated patients and 35.6% in controls (Kaplan-Meier plots, p=0.005). Unadjusted and adjusted risk of death was significantly lower for treated patients compared to controls (HR 0.33 (95%CI 0.15-0.74), p=0.007 and HR 0.18 (95%CI 0.07-0.50), p=0.001, respectively). No significant differences in bloodstream infections or laboratory alterations were registered. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with anakinra plus methylprednisolone may be a valid therapeutic option in COVID-19 patients with hyperinflammation and respiratory failure, also on mechanical ventilation. Randomized, controlled trials including use of either agent alone are needed to confirm these results.","Bozzi, Giorgio; Mangioni, Davide; Minoia, Francesca; Aliberti, Stefano; Grasselli, Giacomo; Barbetta, Laura; Castelli, Valeria; Palomba, Emanuele; Alagna, Laura; Lombardi, Andrea; Ungaro, Riccardo; Agostoni, Carlo; Baldini, Marina; Blasi, Francesco; Cesari, Matteo; Costantino, Giorgio; Fracanzani, Anna Ludovica; Montano, Nicola; Monzani, Valter; Pesenti, Antonio; Peyvandi, Flora; Sottocorno, Marcello; Muscatello, Antonio; Filocamo, Giovanni; Gori, Andrea; Bandera, Alessandra",,661,1

About 67% of the patients in March-April and 93% in May-June have contracted the disease from the local transmission. The mean number of symptoms in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients was significantly higher than suspected patients (6.46 vs 5.04, p=0.003). The number of deaths was low (n=8) with 86% recovery rate. Mild COVID patients received acetaminophen (n=102), azithromycin (n=8), and hydroxychloroquine (n=4) in addition to standard medical care. The treatment provided to moderate-severe cases included acetaminophen (45/45), azithromycin (45/45), Ivermectin (14/45) and corticosteroids (13/45). The mean number of antimicrobials was significantly higher in moderate-severe patients than mild cases (1.80 vs 1.12, p=0.001). Low number of deaths with a high recovery rate was reported. Diabetes was the most common comorbid condition followed by hypertension. Many antimicrobials were prescribed in both mild and moderate-severe cases that require careful review.","Kamran, S.

Imaging of lungs can play a key role in monitoring of the healthy status. Non-contrast chest computed tomography (CT) has been used for this purpose, mainly in China, with a significant success. However, this approach cannot be used massively mainly for both high risk and cost and in some countries also because this tool is not extensively available. Alternatively, chest X-ray, although less sensitive than CT-scan, can provide important information about the evolution of pulmonary involvement during the disease, this aspect is very important to verify the response of a patient to treatments. Here, we show how to improve the sensitivity of chest X-ray via a nonlinear post processing tool, named PACE, combining properly fast and adaptive bidimensional empirical mode decomposition and contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE). The results show an enhancement of the image contrast as confirmed by three widely used metrics: (i) contrast improvement index, (ii) entropy, and (iii) measure of enhancement. This improvement gives rise to a detectability of more lung lesions as identified by two radiologists, which evaluate the images separately, and confirmed by CT-scans. Based on our findings this method is proved as a flexible and effective way for medical image enhancement and can be used as a post-processing step for medical image understanding and analysis.","Siracusano, Giulio; Corte, Aurelio La; Gaeta, Michele; Cicero, Giuseppe; Chiappini, Massimo; Finocchio, Giovanni",,661,24

In order to break the chain of spread, social distancing is strictly followed as a norm. This paper demonstrates a system which is useful in monitoring public places like ATMs, malls and hospitals for any social distancing violations. With the help of this proposed system, it would be conveniently possible to monitor individuals whether they are maintaining the social distancing in the area under surveillance and also to alert the individuals as and when there is any violations from the predefined limits. The proposed deep learning technology based system can be installed for coverage within a certain limited distance. The algorithm could be implemented on the live images of CCTV cameras to perform the task. The simulated model uses deep learning algorithms with OpenCV library to estimate distance between the people in the frame, and a YOLO model trained on COCO dataset to identify people in the frame. The system has to be configured according to the location it is being installed at. By implementing the algorithm, the number of violations are reported based on the distance and set threshold. Number of violations reported are one and two for two real time images respectively. The red box highlighting the violations are displayed along with distance.

The pandemic SARS-Cov-2 outbreak necessitated the implementation of changes in everyday obstetric attendance, which demands continuity of care. Employment of sudden changes in obstetric attendance could have increased anxiety among medical personnel. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the Communication was to analyse the influence of professional experience on the level of anxiety in a group of midwives during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The analysis included 100 midwives: average professional experience: 11.51 years (max. 36; median 7,5; SD: 10.37; p<0.0001). The largest group of respondents was employed in a tertiary referral hospital (n = 40), the smallest in a medical clinic (n = 7). A preliminary study using an online questionnaire, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screener (GAD-7), posted on Internet fora, Facebook fan pages of The Childbirth with Dignity Foundation, and the Foundation for Midwives, using the Snowball sampling method. The Ethics Committee for Research Projects at the Institute of Psychology, University of Gdansk, approved the research project (Approval No. 35/2020). RESULTS: The average score was 9.390 (max. 21, median 8.5; SD; 5.228). The length of professional experience did not correspond to the level of anxiety (r = -0.0097; p = 0.9237). In 20 respondents, no anxiety was traced, while the smallest group indicated severe anxiety (n = 15). Professional experience did not influence the level of anxiety in either group with different level of anxiety (ANOVA test; p = 0.465). . CONCLUSIONS: Professional experience did not influence the level of anxiety. In order to prevent exacerbation of anxiety symptoms, different factors which may playa vital role in enhancing the level of anxiety must be analysed.","Gotlib, Joanna; Rzonca, Ewa; Baranowska, Barbara; Tataj-Puzyna, Urszula; Pawlicka, Paulina; Jaworski, Mariusz; Wójcik-Fatla, Angelina; Panczyk, Mariusz",Ann Agric Environ Med,661,24

For example, epidemiologists demonstrated 100% prevalence of dental caries in the Russian population followed by clinical manifestation of periodontal diseases. Inadequately provided oral health services in populations are caused by multi-factorial deficits including but not limited to low socio-economic status of affected individuals, lack of insurance in sub-populations, insufficient density of dedicated medical units. Another important aspect is the ""participatory"" medicine based on the active participation of population in maintaining oral health: healthcare will remain insufficient as long as the patient is not motivated and does not feel responsible for their oral health. To this end, nearly half of chronically diseased people do not comply with adequate medical services suffering from severely progressing pathologies. Noteworthy, the prominent risk factors and comorbidities linked to the severe disease course and poor outcomes in COVID-19-infected individuals, such as elderly, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and cardiovascular disease, are frequently associated with significantly altered oral microbiome profiles, systemic inflammatory processes and poor oral health. Suggested pathomechanisms consider potential preferences in the interaction between the viral particles and the host microbiota including oral cavity, the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Since an aspiration of periodontopathic bacteria induces the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and production of inflammatory cytokines in the lower respiratory tract, poor oral hygiene and periodontal disease have been proposed as leading to COVID-19 aggravation. Consequently, the issue-dedicated expert recommendations are focused on the optimal oral hygiene as being crucial for improved individual outcomes and reduced morbidity under the COVID-19 pandemic condition. Current study demonstrated that age, gender, socio-economic status, quality of environment and life-style, oral hygiene quality, regularity of dental services requested, level of motivation and responsibility for own health status and corresponding behavioural patterns are the key parameters for the patient stratification considering person-tailored approach in a complex dental care in the population. Consequently, innovative screening programmes and adapted treatment schemes are crucial for the complex person-tailored dental care to improve individual outcomes and healthcare provided to the population.","Tachalov, V V; Orekhova, L Y; Kudryavtseva, T V; Loboda, E S; Pachkoriia, M G; Berezkina, I V; Golubnitschaja, O",EPMA J,661,24

During the routine examination of CXRs, using both frontal and lateral CXRs can benefit clinical diagnosis of cardiothoracic and lung diseases. However, the accurate segmentation of lung fields on both frontal and lateral CXRs is still challenging due to the blurry boundary of the lung field on lateral CXRs and the poor generalization ability of the models. Existing deep learning-based methods focused on lung field segmentation on frontal CXRs, and the generalization ability of these methods on the different type of CXRs (e.g., pediatric CXRs) and new lung diseases (e.g., COVID-19) has not been tested. In this paper, a view identification assisted fully convolutional network (VI-FCN) is proposed for the segmentation of lung fields on frontal and lateral CXRs simultaneously. The VI-FCN consists of an FCN branch for lung field segmentation and a view identification branch for identification of the frontal and lateral CXRs and for enhancing the lung field segmentation. To improve the generalization ability of VI-FCN, six public datasets and our frontal and lateral CXRs (over 2000 CXRs) were collected for training. The segmentation of lung fields on the Japanese Society of Radiological Technology (JSRT) dataset yields mean dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.979 &#x00B1;0.008, mean Jaccard index (&#x03A9;) of 0.959 &#x00B1;0.016, and mean boundary distance (MBD) of 1.023 &#x00B1;0.487mm. Besides, the VI-FCN achieves mean DSC of 0.973 &#x00B1;0.010, mean &#x03A9;of 0.947 &#x00B1;0.018, and mean MBD of 1.923 &#x00B1;0.755mm for the segmentation of lung fields on our lateral CXRs. The experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed VI-FCN over most of existing state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the proposed VI-FCN achieves promising results on untrained pediatric CXRs and COVID-19 datasets.

Several drugs, including lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, dexamethasone, and remdesivir, have been evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19 during the past year. While most of the drugs failed to display efficacy in treating COVID-19, scientists have encouraged herd immunity to control the pandemic. Immunity generated after natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 is precarious, as indicated by real-world evidence in the form of epidemiological data from Manaus, Brazil. Vaccines using different platforms are therefore the most promising approach to help us return to normality. Although several vaccines have been authorized for emergency use, there are still many concerns regarding their accessibility, the vaccination rate, and most importantly, their efficacy in preventing infection with emerging virus variants. Continued virus surveillance and rapid redesign of new vaccines to counter new variants are crucial to fighting COVID-19. Rapid production and extensive vaccination are also essential to preventing the emergence of new variants. Nevertheless, antivirals including monoclonal antibodies and oral medicines need to be developed in light of uncertainties with regard to vaccination. In the battle between humans and SARS-CoV-2, the speed with which we fight the virus, and especially its emerging variants, is the key to winning.","Chen, Jun; Lu, Hongzhou",Biosci Trends,661,15

Objectives: To evaluate the innate immune mediators related to respiratory viruses in the bronchial biopsies and lung parenchyma of stable COPD patients. Methods: We evaluated the immunohistochemical (IHC) expression of Toll-like receptors 3-7-8-9 (TLR-3-7-8-9), TIR domain-containing adaptor inducing IFNß (TRIF), Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), Phospho interferon regulatory factor 3&nbsp; ( pIRF3), Interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7), Phospho interferon regulatory factor 7 (pIRF7), retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG1), melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), Probable ATP-dependent RNA helicase DHX58 ( LGP2), Mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), Stimulator of interferon genes (STING), DNA-dependent activator of IFN regulatory factors (DAI), forkhead box protein A3(FOXA3), Interferon alfa (IFN&#945;), and Interferon beta (IFNß) in the bronchial mucosa of patients with mild/moderate (n = 16), severe/very severe (n = 18) stable COPD, control smokers (CS) (n = 12), and control non-smokers (CNS) (n = 12). We performed similar IHC analyses in peripheral lung from COPD (n = 12) and CS (n = 12). IFN&#945; and IFNß were assessed in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) supernatant from CNS (n = 8), CS (n = 9) and mild/moderate COPD (n = 12). Viral load, including adenovirus-B, -C, Bocavirus, Respiratory syncytial Virus (RSV),Human Rhinovirus (HRV), Coronavirus, Influenza virus A (FLU-A), Influenza virus B (FLU-B), and Parainfluenzae-1 were measured in bronchial rings and lung parenchyma of COPD patients and the related control group (CS). Results: Among the viral-related innate immune mediators, RIG1, LGP2, MAVS, STING, and DAI resulted well expressed in the bronchial and lung tissues of COPD patients, although not in a significantly different mode from control groups. Compared to CS, COPD patients showed no significant differences of viral load in bronchial rings and lung parenchyma. Conclusions: Some virus-related molecules are well-expressed in the lung tissue and bronchi of stable COPD patients independently of the disease severity, suggesting a ""primed"" tissue environment capable of sensing the potential viral infections occurring in these patients.","D039,; Anna, Silvestro E; Maniscalco, Mauro; Carriero, Vitina; Gnemmi, Isabella; Caramori, Gaetano; Nucera, Francesco; Righi, Luisella; Brun, Paola; Balbi, Bruno; Adcock, Ian M; Stella, Maria Grazia; Ricciardolo, Fabio L M; Di Stefano, Antonino",,661,24

Although its incidence has decreased substantially after the introduction of a vaccination, the burden of the disease remains high. Although the paroxysmal phase is highly disabling, complications are uncommon and more prevalent in children than in adults. The most frequent neurological complication is encephalopathy, but seizures, paresis, paraplegia, ataxias, aphasias, and decerebration postures have also been described. The complication of decerebration postures has not been previously reported in adults. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a video case of an adult HIV patient with severe coughing paroxysms, post-tussive emesis and syncope, whose workup confirmed the diagnosis of a B. pertussis respiratory infection. During hospitalization, he had fluctuant encephalopathy and post-tussive decerebration postures following paroxysms. He was treated with antibiotic therapy and finally sent home without residual neurological deficits. CONCLUSION: This case illustrates the biological plausibility of neurologic complications of pertussis in adults, which, albeit rare, can cause important morbidities. Future research should explore whether there are differences in the clinical presentation, risk factors and pathophysiology of the disease among adults or interventions aimed at preventing or treating pertussis encephalopathy.","Arango-Granados, María Camila; Trompa, Iván Mauricio",BMC Infect Dis,661,2

With half of the world's countries in lockdown as of April due to this pandemic, monitoring and understanding the spread of the virus and infection rates and how these factors relate to behavioural and societal parameters is crucial for developing control strategies. This paper aims to investigate the effectiveness of masks, social distancing, lockdown and self-isolation for reducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Our findings from an agent-based simulation modelling showed that whilst requiring a lockdown is widely believed to be the most efficient method to quickly reduce infection numbers, the practice of social distancing and the usage of surgical masks can potentially be more effective than requiring a lockdown. Our multivariate analysis of simulation results using the Morris Elementary Effects Method suggests that if a sufficient proportion of the population uses surgical masks and follows social distancing regulations, then SARS-CoV-2 infections can be controlled without requiring a lockdown.","Li, Kelvin K F; Jarvis, Stephen A; Minhas, Fayyaz",Comput Biol Med,661,1

As with many other diseases, natural compounds can be helpful in the treatment of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 main protease enzyme has an important role in viral replication and transcription. Therefore, inhibiting this enzyme may be helpful in the treatment of COVID-19. In this study, it is aimed to investigate eight natural compounds which have recently entered the literature, computationally for their potential use against SARS-CoV-2. For this purpose, first, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed on the investigated compounds, and energy minimizations, geometry optimizations, vibrational analyses, molecular electrostatic potential map calculations were carried out. After DFT calculations, geometry optimized structures were subjected to molecular docking calculations with the use of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (pdb id: 5r80) and top-scoring ligand-receptor complexes were obtained. In the next part of the study, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed on the top-scoring ligand-receptor complexes to investigate the stability of the ligand-receptor complexes and the interactions between ligands and receptor in more detail. Additionally, in this part of the study, binding free energies are calculated with the use of molecular mechanics with Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) method. Results showed that, all ligand-receptor complexes remain stable during the MD simulations and most of the investigated compounds but especially two of them showed considerably high binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 main protease.

However, there have been few empirical analyses of the effect of the pandemic on individuals' level of nationalism. Using evidence from two original surveys conducted in Canada in 2019 and 2020, I show that public support for international economic integration has increased rather than decreased since the outbreak of the pandemic. The survey data point to economic anxiety induced by the pandemic as a key mechanism shaping individuals' attitudes towards international economic integration. While the existing literature has found that negative economic sentiment depresses support for international economic integration, economic anxiety appears to be positively related to support for integration in the COVID-19 era. My findings therefore run counter to current arguments about the effect of the pandemic and to expectations based on the existing literature. Gaining a better empirical understanding of the relationship between the pandemic and nationalism in public opinion is particularly important at a time when international cooperation is needed to address both COVID-19 and its economic effects.

Influenza often has rapid onset and relatively short duration, both in the individual and in the population. The case fatality rate varies for different strains of the virus, as do the effects on total mortality. Outbreaks related to coronavirus infections have recently become a global concern but much less is known about the dynamics of these outbreaks and their effects on mortality. In this work, disease outbreaks in Sweden, in the time period of 1860-2020, are characterized and compared to the currently ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. The focus is on outbreaks with a sharp increase in all-cause mortality. Outbreak onset is defined as the time point when death counts start to increase consistently for a period of at least 10 days. The duration of the outbreak is defined as the time period in which mortality rates are elevated. Excess mortality is estimated by standard methods. In total there were 15 outbreaks detected in the time period, the first 14 were likely caused by influenza virus infections, the last by SARS-CoV-2. The mortality dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is shown to be similar to outbreaks due to influenza virus, and in terms of the number of excess deaths, it is the worst outbreak in Sweden since the ""Spanish flu"" of 1918-1919.","Ledberg, Anders",Front Public Health,661,20

However, only few studies have analyzed the costs associated with mHealth solutions for HIV care. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate the total incremental costs and incremental cost per beneficiary of an interactive SMS text messaging support intervention within a clinical trial. METHODS: The Mobile WAChX trial (NCT02400671) evaluates an interactive semiautomated SMS text messaging intervention to improve adherence to antiretroviral therapy and retention in care among peripartum women infected with HIV in Kenya to reduce the mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Women were randomized to receive one-way versus two-way SMS text messages. Messages were sent weekly, and these messages included motivational and educational content and visit reminders; two-way messaging enabled prompt consultation with the nurse as needed. Microcosting methods were used to collect resource-use data related to implementing the Mobile WAChX SMS text messaging intervention. At 2 sites (Nairobi and Western Kenya), we conducted semistructured interviews with health personnel to identify startup and recurrent activities by obtaining information on the personnel, supplies, and equipment. Data on expenditures and prices from project expense reports, administrative records, and published government salary data were included to estimate the total incremental costs. Using a public provider perspective, we estimated incremental unit costs per beneficiary and per contact during 2017. RESULTS: The weighted average annual incremental costs for the two-way SMS text messaging group were US $3725 per facility, US $62 per beneficiary, and US $0.85 per contact to reach 115 beneficiaries. For the one-way SMS text messaging group, the weighted average annual incremental costs were US $2542 per facility, US $41 per beneficiary, and US $0.66 per contact to reach 117 beneficiaries. The largest cost shares were for the personnel: 48.2% (US $1794/US $3725) in two-way and 32.4% (US $825/US $2542) in one-way SMS text messaging groups. Costs associated with software development and communication accounted for 29.9% (US $1872/US $6267) of the costs in both intervention arms (US $1042 vs US $830, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Cost information for budgeting and financial planning is relevant for implementing mHealth interventions in national health plans. Given the proportion of costs related to systems development, it is likely that costs per beneficiary will decline with the scale-up of the interventions.","Chen, Yilin; Ronen, Keshet; Matemo, Daniel; Unger, Jennifer A; Kinuthia, John; John-Stewart, Grace; Levin, Carol",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,661,26

A syndemic framework, the authors advise, will enable bioethicists to recognize the ethical principles that should guide efforts to reduce the unequal effects that Covid-19 has on populations. Drawing on sub-Saharan African conceptions of solidarity, the authors lay out an approach to global vaccine distribution that prioritizes low- and middle-income countries. Like Jecker and Atuire's article, an essay by philosopher Keisha Ray pushes bioethicists to recognize broader justice-oriented responsibilities with the aid of a wide-angle lens.

We, therefore, aim to describe our experience with the use of early proning in awake, non-intubated patients with confirmed COVID-19. In our retrospective observational study, 23 patients with confirmed positive PCR test results for Severe Acute respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and hypoxemia that required oxygen therapy with or without non-invasive ventilation were treated with PP. Patients were classified into mild, moderate and severe COVID-19 disease. There were no targeted number of hours for proning per day and patients were kept in prone position according to their tolerance. The primary outcome measure was the avoidance of intubation and secondary outcomes were in-hospital mortality, length of hospital stays and complications related to PP. The mean (standard deviation) age of our cohort was 54.5 (11.7) years, and the majority were males (21/23, 91.3%). Sixty-one per cent (14/23) of the patients were suffering from severe disease and 82.6% (19/23) had bilateral lung involvement with interstitial infiltrates. Majority of the patients were prone positioned for a median of 6 days (IQR 4 - 8). Only one patient required transfer to ICU for mechanical ventilation and subsequently died due to severe ARDS. All 22 patients showed progressive improvement in oxygen requirement and PF ratio, mostly after 3-5 days of proning. The mean length of hospital stay was 12 days. All patients, except one, were discharged in stable conditions, on room air or on a minimal oxygen requirement of 1-2 liters. No major complication of PP was recorded. Awake prone positioning is a valuable and safe therapeutic adjunct that can be applied in patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19. It can also be included in the home-based management protocols of COVID-19 to improve patient outcomes and mitigate the burden on health care facilities.","Khanum, Iffat; Samar, Fatima; Fatimah, Yousuf; Safia, Awan; Adil, Aziz; Kiren, Habib; Nasir, Nosheen; Faisal, Mahmood; Bushra, Jamil",Monaldi arch. chest dis,661,33

From the beginning of the outbreak to now, there have been many mathematical models proposed to describe the spread of the pandemic, and most of them are established with the assumption that people contact with each other in a homogeneous pattern. However, owing to the difference of individuals in reality, social contact is usually heterogeneous, and the models on homogeneous networks cannot accurately describe the outbreak. Thus, we propose a susceptible-asymptomatic-infected-removed (SAIR) model on social networks to describe the spread of COVID-19 and analyse the outbreak based on the epidemic data of Wuhan from January 24 to March 2. Then, according to the results of the simulations, we discover that the measures that can curb the spread of COVID-19 include increasing the recovery rate and the removed rate, cutting off connections between symptomatically infected individuals and their neighbours, and cutting off connections between hub nodes and their neighbours. The feasible measures proposed in the paper are in fair agreement with the measures that the government took to suppress the outbreak. Furthermore, effective measures should be carried out immediately, otherwise the pandemic would spread more rapidly and last longer. In addition, we use the epidemic data of Wuhan from January 24 to March 2 to analyse the outbreak in the city and explain why the number of the infected rose in the early stage of the outbreak though a total lockdown was implemented. Moreover, besides the above measures, a feasible way to curb the spread of COVID-19 is to reduce the density of social networks, such as restricting mobility and decreasing in-person social contacts. This work provides a series of effective measures, which can facilitate the selection of appropriate approaches for controlling the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic to mitigate its adverse impact on people's livelihood, societies and economies.","Liu, Congying; Wu, Xiaoqun; Niu, Riuwu; Wu, Xiuqi; Fan, Ruguo",Nonlinear Dyn,661,1

LUS may be useful in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19. METHODS: This study was conducted at two United States hospitals from 3/21/2020 to 6/01/2020. Our inclusion criteria included hospitalized adults with COVID-19 (based on symptomatology and a confirmatory RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2) who received a LUS. Providers used a 12-zone LUS scanning protocol. The images were interpreted by the researchers based on a pre-developed consensus document. Patients were stratified by clinical deterioration (defined as either ICU admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, or death within 28 days from the initial symptom onset) and time from symptom onset to their scan. RESULTS: N = 22 patients (N = 36 scans) were included. Eleven (50%) patients experienced clinical deterioration. Among N = 36 scans, only 3 (8%) were classified as normal. The remaining scans demonstrated B-lines (89%), consolidations (56%), pleural thickening (47%), and pleural effusion (11%). Scans from patients with clinical deterioration demonstrated higher percentages of bilateral consolidations (50 versus 15%; P = .033), anterior consolidations (47 versus 11%; P = .047), lateral consolidations (71 versus 29%; P = .030), pleural thickening (69 versus 30%; P = .045), but not B-lines (100 versus 80%; P = .11). Abnormal findings had similar prevalences between scans collected 0-6 days and 14-28 days from symptom onset. DISCUSSION: Certain LUS findings may be common in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, especially for those that experience clinical deterioration. These findings may occur anytime throughout the first 28 days of illness. Future efforts should investigate the predictive utility of these findings on clinical outcomes.","Kumar, Andre; Weng, Yingjie; Duanmu, Youyou; Graglia, Sally; Lalani, Farhan; Gandhi, Kavita; Lobo, Viveta; Jensen, Trevor; Chung, Sukyung; Nahn, Jeffrey; Kugler, John",J. ultrasound med,661,13

Age and weight were independent risk factors for disease severity. CONCLUSION: Deterioration among COVID-19-infected patients occurred rapidly after hospital admission. In our cohort, we found that multiple factors were associated with the severity of COVID19. Early detection and monitoring of these indicators may reduce the progression of the disease. Removing these factors may halt the progression of the disease. In addition, Oxygen support, early treatment with low doses of glucocorticoids and artificial liver therapy, when necessary, may help reduce mortality in critically ill patients.","Yi, Ping; Yang, Xiang; Ding, Cheng; Chen, Yanfei; Xu, Kaijin; Ni, Qing; Zhao, Hong; Li, Yongtao; Zhang, Xuan; Liu, Jun; Sheng, Jifang; Li, Lanjuan",BMC Infect Dis,661,16

With an emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, growing emphasis has been placed on the palliative needs of people with Parkinson's (PwP), particularly elderly, frail, and with comorbidities.Areas covered: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic poses an enormous challenge on aspects of daily living in PwP and might interact negatively with a range of motor and non-motor symptoms (NMS), both directly and indirectly - as a consequence of pandemic-related social and health care restrictions. Here, the authors outline some of the motor and NMS relevant to PC, and propose a pragmatic and rapidly deployable, consensus-based PC approach for PwP during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, potentially relevant also for future pandemics.Expert opinion: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic poses a considerable impact on PwP and their caregivers, ranging from mental health issues to worsening of physical symptoms - both in the short- and long-term, (Long-COVID) and calls for specific, personalized PC strategies relevant in a lockdown setting globally. Validated assessment tools should be applied remotely to flag up particular motor or NMS that require special attention, both in short- and long-term.","Chaudhuri, K Ray; Rukavina, Katarina; McConvey, Victor; Antonini, Angelo; Lorenzl, Stefan; Bhidayasiri, Roongroj; Piemonte, Maria Elisa Pimentel; Lim, Shen-Yang; Richfield, Edward; Walker, Richard; Bouca-Machado, Raquel; Bajwah, Sabrina; Gao, Wei; Trivedi, Dhaval; Miyasaki, Janis",Expert Rev Neurother,661,10

To date, however, no effective treatments or enough vaccines for COVID-19 are available. The roles of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and spike protein in the treatment of COVID-19 are major areas of research. In this study, we explored the potential of ACE2 and spike protein as targets for the development of antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2. We analyzed clinical data, genetic data, and receptor binding capability. Clinical data revealed that COVID-19 patients with comorbidities related to an abnormal renin-angiotensin system exhibited more early symptoms and poorer prognoses. However, the relationship between ACE2 expression and COVID-19 progression is still not clear. Furthermore, if ACE2 is not a good targetable protein, it would not be applicable across a wide range of populations. The spike-S1 receptor-binding domain that interacts with ACE2 showed various amino acid mutations based on sequence analysis. We identified two spike-S1 point mutations (V354F and V470A) by receptor-ligand docking and binding enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. These variants enhanced the binding of the spike protein to ACE2 receptors and were potentially associated with increased infectivity. Importantly, the number of patients infected with the V354F and V470A mutants has increased with the development of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. These results suggest that ACE2 and spike-S1 are likely not ideal targets for the design of peptide drugs to treat COVID-19 in different populations.","Shu, Chuan-Jun; Huang, Xuan; Tang, Hui-Hao; Mo, Ding-Ding; Zhou, Jian-Wei; Deng, Cheng",Zool Res,661,1

A thematic analysis of written accounts from UK smokers,18.074394,3.733834,2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 affects multiple organs. Studies have reported mild elevations of lipase levels of unclear significance. Our study aims to determine the outcomes in patients with COVID-19 and hyperlipasemia, and whether correlation with D-dimer levels explains the effect on outcomes. METHODS: Case-control study from two large tertiary care health systems, of patients with COVID-19 disease admitted between March 1 and May 1, 2020 who had lipase levels recorded. Data analyzed to study primary outcomes of mortality, length of stay (LOS) and intensive care utilization in hyperlipasemia patients, and correlation with D-dimer and outcomes. RESULTS: 992 out of 5597 COVID-19 patients had lipase levels, of which 429 (43%) had hyperlipasemia. 152 (15%) patients had a lipase > 3x ULN, with clinical pancreatitis in 2 patients. Hyperlipasemia had a higher mortality than normal lipase patients (32% vs. 23%, OR = 1.6,95%CI = 1.2-2.1, P = 0.002). In subgroup analysis, hyperlipasemia patients had significantly worse LOS (11vs.15 days, P = 0.01), ICU admission rates (44% vs. 66%,OR = 2.5,95%CI = 1.3-5.0,P = 0.008), ICU LOS (12vs.19 days,P = 0.01), mechanical ventilation rates (34% vs. 55%,OR = 2.4,95%CI = 1.3-4.8,P = 0.01), and durations of mechanical ventilation (14 vs. 21 days, P = 0.008). Hyperlipasemia patients were more likely to have a D-dimer value in the highest two quartiles, and had increased mortality (59% vs. 15%,OR = 7.2,95%CI = 4.5-11,P < 0.001) and LOS (10vs.7 days,P < 0.001) compared to those with normal lipase and lower D-dimer levels. CONCLUSION: There is high prevalence of hyperlipasemia without clinical pancreatitis in COVID-19 disease. Hyperlipasemia was associated with higher mortality and ICU utilization, possibly explained by elevated D-dimer.","Ahmed, Awais; Fisher, Jason C; Pochapin, Mark B; Freedman, Steven D; Kothari, Darshan J; Shah, Paresh C; Sheth, Sunil G",Pancreatology,661,22

Early and accurate diagnosis and quarantine remain the most effective mitigation strategy. Although reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis, recent studies suggest that nucleic acids were undetectable in a significant number of cases with clinical features of COVID-19. Serologic assays that detect human antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 serve as a complementary method to diagnose these cases, as well as to identify asymptomatic cases and qualified convalescent serum donors. However, commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) are laborious and non-quantitative, while point-of-care assays suffer from low detection accuracy. To provide a serologic assay with high performance and portability for potential point-of-care applications, we developed DNA-assisted nanopore sensing for quantification of SARS-CoV-2 related antibodies in human serum. Different DNA structures were used as detection reporters for multiplex quantification of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 in serum specimens from patients with conformed or suspected infection. Comparing to a clinically used point-of-care assay and an ELISA assay, our technology can reliably quantify SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with higher accuracy, large dynamic range, and potential for assay automation.","Zhang, Zehui; Wang, Xiaoqin; Wei, Xiaojun; Zheng, Sophia W; Lenhart, Brian J; Xu, Peisheng; Li, Jie; Pan, Jing; Albrecht, Helmut; Liu, Chang",Biosens Bioelectron,661,16

A cross-sectional survey was conducted between the 19th and 22nd of March to assess the public's awareness toward COVID-19. Multiple scored domains were used to assess the differences between the two populations. Statistical analysis was conducted to reveal the influence of sociodemographic variables on these scores. A total of 3167 participants were recruited in the study, of which, 1599 (50.5%) were from Jordan and 1568 (49.5%) were from Iraq. More than half of the Jordanian (56.8%) and Iraqi participants (53.2%) showed average or adequate awareness about COVID-19. More than 60% of both populations relied on medical staff for COVID-19 related information. Social media was the second most common COVID-19 information source, as it was reported by 53.7% of Jordanian participants and 62.8% of Iraqi participants. More than 90% of both populations participated in precautionary measurements. Finally, about 20% of both populations failed to recognize droplet inhalation as a source of transmission.

METHODS: Patients were recruited from July 2014 to December 2015 and randomly assigned to one of two groups: KFEH (n = 60) and SPT (n = 59). Outcomes (joint function) were evaluated according to the Knee Society Score (KSS), visual analog scale (VAS), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score, and range of motion (ROM) assessment at selected time points (preoperatively; 1 week; 1, 3, and 6 months; and 1 year after surgery). RESULTS: Pain and functional improvement were observed in both groups. Non-inferiority of KFEH was evident 12 months postoperatively; however, patients in the KFEH group exhibited better ROM at 1 month (P < 0.01). Absolute WOMAC and KSS scores were slightly better in the KFEH group, although the difference was not statistically significant. There was no difference in VAS scores and complication rates between the two groups. Additionally, the home program would save patient time and decrease the economic burden associated with in-hospital SPT.

Although it primarily involves the respiratory tract system, cardiovascular complications, particularly arterial and venous thrombosis, are frequently reported and are associated with adverse outcomes. Case summary We describe the case of a 57-year-old female who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and shock. She was found to have left lower extremity deep vein thrombosis and a suspected pulmonary embolism. A large mobile right atrial mass was found on echocardiogram. Given the large thrombus burden that portended an extremely high risk for embolization to the pulmonary arteries, emergent percutaneous aspiration of an organized thrombus (rather than thrombolysis) was performed using the AngioVac system (Angiodynamics Inc., Latham, NY, USA) complicated by haemodynamic collapse due to acute right ventricular failure. An Impella RP (Abiomed, Danvers, MA, USA) was then placed, with rapid stabilization of haemodynamics. The patient tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). She was treated with antimicrobial and systemic anticoagulation therapy. She was successfully weaned off the Impella RP on post-operative day 4 and was extubated on day 5. She was discharged on day 16 in a stable condition. Discussion Incident venous thrombo-embolism is frequently encountered in COVID-19 patients.

The qualitative analysis revealed five themes-society, health, social activities, personal economy and duration-and 13 sub-themes, mostly related to the themes ""society"" and ""health"" (724 and 704, respectively). Empathy for others was prominent, for society (nationally and globally), but also concerns related to infecting others and family members at risk for developing serious illness if infected. The responses to the open-ended question yielded additional information, beyond the information obtained from questions with pre-categorized response options, especially related to concerns about society and health. Themes arising from the qualitative analysis shed light on what are important concerns for people during the pandemic and this may serve as targeted measures for the authorities.","Skogstad, Laila; Schou-Bredal, Inger; Bonsaksen, Tore; Heir, Trond; Ekeberg, Øivind; Grimholt, Tine",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),661,25

413462,413462,413462,Men and COVID-19: A Pathophysiologic Review,18.463537,3.7402127,2020,"BACKGROUND: Testicular adrenal rest tumors (TARTs) are benign masses deemed to originate from pluripotent testicular steroidogenic cells that grow under chronic ACTH stimulation. These lesions, occasionally misdiagnosed as Leydig cell tumors (LCTs), are typically described in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is an inherited disorder of beta-oxidation with accumulation of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) in various tissues, and a rare cause of primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI). TARTs have never been associated with X-ALD. CASE 1 DESCRIPTION: A 19-year old male, who had previously undergone bilateral enucleation of presumed LCTs, was referred to our unit. Follow-up scans showed persistent bilateral lesions compatible with TARTs. Biochemical exams revealed PAI but excluded CAH. A serum VLCFAs panel was consistent with X-ALD, with gene testing confirming the diagnosis. Histological revision of the previously resected testicular lesions was compatible with TARTs. Start of glucocorticoid replacement therapy was associated with a reduction of testicular masses. CASE 2 DESCRIPTION: A 26-year old X-ALD male was diagnosed with bilateral testicular lesions compatible with TARTs. These lesions increased after ACTH elevation following switch to modified-release hydrocortisone. Clinical and sonographic findings allowed for a ""watchful-waiting"" approach, avoiding unnecessary surgery. CONCLUSION: These are the first cases reported of TARTs in patients with X-ALD-associated PAI. Testicular lesions in patients with an early onset of ACTH elevation, regardless of the cause, should always be thoughtfully investigated, as they may reveal themselves as TARTs. We suggest that all patients affected from chronic ACTH elevation of a young age of onset should undergo testicular ultrasound in order to evaluate the presence of these lesions. GRT in these patients might also help preserving fertility.","Tresoldi, A S; Betella, N; Hasenmajer, V; Pozza, C; Vena, W; Fiamengo, B; Negri, L; Cappa, M; Lania, A G A; Lenzi, A; Isidori, A M; Pizzocaro, A",J. endocrinol. invest,661,16

Furthermore, we sought to assess the level of general satisfaction with the services they have obtained remotely. Methodology: A sample of 623 parents of children with disabilities filled out an electronic self-report questionnaire during the period June 4th to June 20th, 2020. Results: The parents reported a high level of worry regarding the possibility of their child getting infected. Parents continue to worry about losing their child’s care and treatment. Parents who hold a bachelor’s degree feel the sources of stress at a higher level compared to parents with lower than high school education. A proportion of 59% of parents reported not receiving services from special education centers during the pandemic, and 41% of parents were satisfied with the services provided by the center of special education. Parents with a bachelor’s degree or higher were less satisfied with the center’s services. Parents with a higher qualification than secondary school use several sources to overcome the pressure associated with educating a child with a disability.

S protein is the key viral protein for associating with ACE2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2. There are many kinds of post-translational modifications in S protein. The mechanism of palmitoylation of SARS-CoV-2 S remains to be elucidated. In our current study, we characterized the palmitoylation of SARS-CoV-2 S. Both the C15 and cytoplasmic tail of SARS-CoV-2 S were palmitoylated. Fatty acid synthase inhibitor C75 and zinc finger DHHC domain-containing palmitoyltransferase (ZDHHC) inhibitor 2-BP reduced the palmitoylation of S. Interestingly, palmitoylation of SARS-CoV-2 S was not required for plasma membrane targeting of S, but was critical for S mediated syncytia formation and SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus particle entry. Overexpression ZDHHC2, ZDHHC3, ZDHHC4, ZDHHC5, ZDHHC8, ZDHHC9, ZDHHC11, ZDHHC14, ZDHHC16, ZDHHC19 and ZDHHC20 promoted the palmitoylation of S. Furthermore, those ZDHHCs were identified to associate with SARS-CoV-2 S. Our study not only reveals the mechanism of S palmitoylation, but also will shed important light into the role of S palmitoylation in syncytia formation and virus entry.

DESIGN: Before-and-after intervention study without a control group (interrupted time-series analysis). SETTING: All 29 Israeli general hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: All HCWs. INTERVENTIONS: Two national regulations were issued on March 25, 2020: one required universal masking of HCWs, patients, and visitors in general hospitals and the second defined what constitutes HCW exposure to severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and when quarantine is required. RESULTS: Overall, 283 HCWs were infected at work or from an unknown source. Before the intervention, the number of HCWs infected at work increased by 0.5 per day (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.2-0.7; P < .001), peaking at 16. After the intervention, new infections declined by 0.2 per day (95% CI, -0.3 to -0.1; P < .001). Before the intervention, the number of HCWs in quarantine or isolation increased by 97 per day (95% CI, 90-104; P < .001), peaking at 2,444. After the intervention, prevalence decreased by 59 per day (95% CI, -72 to -46; P < .001). Epidemiological investigations determined that the most common source of HCW infection (58%) was a coworker. CONCLUSIONS: Universal masking in general hospitals reduced the risk of hospital-acquired COVID-19 among HCWs. Universal masking combined with uniform definitions of HCW exposure and criteria for quarantine limited the absence of HCWs from the workforce.","Temkin, Elizabeth; Schwaber, Mitchell J; Vaturi, Azza; Nadir, Eyal; Zilber, Rama; Barel, Osnat; Pavlov, Lidia; Carmeli, Yehuda",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,661,33

Results: Pre-existing CVDs resulted in viral invasion, ROS elevation and activation of apoptosis pathways contribute myocardial injury during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Viral infection increased fasting blood glucose and reduced insulin response in DM model. Bone mineral density decreased shortly after infection, which associated with impaired PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling. Conclusion: We established mouse models mimicked the complex pathological symptoms of COVID-19 patients with chronic diseases.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, primarily involves the respiratory system with viral pneumonia as a predominant manifestation. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 has various cardiovascular manifestations which increase morbidity and mortality in COVID-19. Patients with underlying cardiovascular diseases and conventional cardiovascular risk factors are predisposed for COVID-19 with worse prognosis. The possible mechanisms of cardiovascular injury are endothelial dysfunction, diffuse microangiopathy with thrombosis and increased angiotensin II levels. Hyperinflammation in the myocardium can result in acute coronary syndrome, myocarditis, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death. The high level of cardiac troponins and natriuretic peptides in the early course of COVID-19 reflects an acute myocardial injury. The complex association between COVID-19 and cardiovascular manifestations requires an in-depth understanding for appropriate management of these patients. Till the time a specific antiviral drug is available for COVID-19, treatment remains symptomatic. This review provides information on the cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19.","Sharma, Yash Paul; Agstam, Sourabh; Yadav, Ashutosh; Gupta, Anunay; Gupta, Ankur",Indian journal of medical research,661,1

The extent of environmental contamination has not been fully investigated in the context of severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients. AIM: To investigate environmental SARS-CoV-2 contamination in the isolation rooms of severe COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation or high-flow oxygen therapy. METHODS: Environmental swab samples and air samples were collected from the isolation rooms of three COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia. Patients 1 and 2 received mechanical ventilation with a closed suction system, while patient 3 received high-flow oxygen therapy and non-invasive ventilation. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) was used to detect SARS-CoV-2; viral cultures were performed for samples not negative on rRT-PCR. FINDINGS: Of the 48 swab samples collected in the rooms of patients 1 and 2, only samples from the outside surfaces of the endotracheal tubes tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by rRT-PCR. However, in patient 3's room, 13 of the 28 environmental samples (fomites, fixed structures, and ventilation exit on the ceiling) showed positive results. Air samples were negative for SARS-CoV-2. Viable viruses were identified on the surface of the endotracheal tube of patient 1 and seven sites in patient 3's room. CONCLUSION: Environmental contamination of SARS-CoV-2 may be a route of viral transmission. However, it might be minimized when patients receive mechanical ventilation with a closed suction system. These findings can provide evidence for guidelines for the safe use of personal protective equipment.","Ahn, J Y; An, S; Sohn, Y; Cho, Y; Hyun, J H; Baek, Y J; Kim, M H; Jeong, S J; Kim, J H; Ku, N S; Yeom, J-S; Smith, D M; Lee, H; Yong, D; Lee, Y-J; Kim, J W; Kim, H R; Hwang, J; Choi, J Y",J Hosp Infect,661,16

We aimed to identify previously unreported immune markers able to discriminate COVID-19 patients from healthy controls and to predict mild and severe disease. METHODS: An observational, prospective, multicentric study was conducted in patients with confirmed mild/moderate (n = 7) and severe (n = 19) COVID-19. Immunophenotyping of whole-blood leukocytes was performed in patients upon hospital ward or intensive care unit admission and in healthy controls (n = 25). Clinically relevant associations were identified through unsupervised analysis. RESULTS: Granulocytic (neutrophil, eosinophil, and basophil) markers were enriched during COVID-19 and discriminated between patients with mild and severe disease. Increased counts of CD15+CD16+ neutrophils, decreased granulocytic expression of integrin CD11b, and Th2-related CRTH2 downregulation in eosinophils and basophils established a COVID-19 signature. Severity was associated with emergence of PD-L1 checkpoint expression in basophils and eosinophils. This granulocytic signature was accompanied by monocyte and lymphocyte immunoparalysis. Correlation with validated clinical scores supported pathophysiological relevance. CONCLUSIONS: Phenotypic markers of circulating granulocytes are strong discriminators between infected and uninfected individuals as well as between severity stages. COVID-19 alters the frequency and functional phenotypes of granulocyte subsets with emergence of CRTH2 as a disease biomarker.","Vitte, Joana; Diallo, Aïssatou Bailo; Boumaza, Asma; Lopez, Alexandre; Michel, Moïse; Allardet-Servent, Jérôme; Mezouar, Soraya; Sereme, Youssouf; Busnel, Jean-Marc; Miloud, Tewfik; Malergue, Fabrice; Morange, Pierre-Emmanuel; Halfon, Philippe; Olive, Daniel; Leone, Marc; Mege, Jean-Louis",J Infect Dis,661,16

Mortality attributable to COVID-19 in Denmark increased steeply, and peaked in 2020-W14. As preventive measures and national lockdown were implemented from 2020-W12, the attributable mortality started declining within a few weeks. Mortality attributable to COVID-19 from 2020-W09 to 2020-W20 was estimated to 16.2 (95% confidence interval (CI): 12.0 to 20.4) per 100,000 person-years. The 2019/20 influenza season was mild with few deaths attributable to influenza, 3.2 (95% CI: 1.1 to 5.4) per 100,000 person-years.ConclusionAttMOMO estimates mortality attributable to several pathogens simultaneously, providing a fuller picture of mortality by COVID-19 during the pandemic in the context of other seasonal diseases and mortality patterns. Using Danish data, we show that the model accurately estimates mortality attributable to COVID-19 and influenza, respectively. We propose using standardised indicators for pathogen circulation in the population, to make estimates comparable between countries and applicable for timely monitoring.","Nielsen, Jens; Rod, Naja Hulvej; Vestergaard, Lasse S; Lange, Theis",Euro surveill,661,16

However, there has been little epidemiological research to assess these risks. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of HCW (n = 546) and non-healthcare workers (NHCW; n = 283) with no known prior SARS-CoV-2 infection who were recruited from a large U.S. university and two affiliated university hospitals. In this cross-sectional analysis of data collected at baseline, we examined SARS-CoV-2 infection status (as determined by presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in oropharyngeal swabs) by healthcare worker status and role. RESULTS: At baseline, 41 (5.0%) of the participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, of whom 14 (34.2%) reported symptoms. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was higher among HCW (7.3%) than in NHCW (0.4%), representing a 7.0% greater absolute risk (95% confidence interval for risk difference 4.7, 9.3%). The majority of infected HCW (62.5%) were nurses. Positive tests increased across the two weeks of cohort recruitment in line with rising confirmed cases in the hospitals and surrounding counties. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our results demonstrate that HCW had a higher prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection than NHCW. Continued follow-up of this cohort will enable us to monitor infection rates and examine risk factors for transmission.","Barrett, Emily S; Horton, Daniel B; Roy, Jason; Gennaro, Maria Laura; Brooks, Andrew; Tischfield, Jay; Greenberg, Patricia; Andrews, Tracy; Jagpal, Sugeet; Reilly, Nancy; Carson, Jeffrey L; Blaser, Martin J; Panettieri, Reynold A",BMC Infect Dis,661,25

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a key protein for the viral entry into the host cells. Here, we report an efficient computational approach, including the simple energy minimizations and binding free energy calculations, starting from an experimental structure of the binding complex along with experimental calibration of the calculated binding free energies, to rapidly and reliably predict the binding affinities of the N501Y mutant with human ACE2 (hACE2) and recently reported miniprotein and hACE2 decoy (CTC-445.2) drug candidates. It has been demonstrated that the N501Y mutation markedly increases the ACE2-spike protein binding affinity (Kd) from 22 to 0.44 nM, which could partially explain why the UK variant is more infectious. The miniproteins are predicted to have â¼10,000- to 100,000-fold diminished binding affinities with the N501Y mutant, creating a need for design of novel therapeutic candidates to overcome the N501Y mutation-induced drug resistance. The N501Y mutation is also predicted to decrease the binding affinity of a hACE2 decoy (CTC-445.2) binding with the spike protein by â¼200-fold. This convenient computational approach along with experimental calibration may be similarly used in the future to predict the binding affinities of potential new variants of the spike protein.","Williams, Alexander H; Zhan, Chang-Guo",J Phys Chem B,661,26

Respondents indicated how strong they thought the threat was to themselves, to Poland, and the world. They also described their emotional reactions to the pandemic, which we used to calculate three scores: Anxiety, Hopelessness, and Panic. Respondents also indicated how often they engaged in various coping behaviors and how much they supported different types of economic sacrifice. We used these responses to calculate measures that we labelled as Spread Prevention (e.g., social distancing), Self-preservation (food stockpiling), and Economic Sacrifice (e.g., fighting COVID-19 regardless of the cost). Multiple regression analyses found that perceived threat to self was the most reliable predictor (positive) of emotional reactions and of coping behaviors, and that Anxiety was the most reliable predictor (positive) of Spread prevention and Economic sacrifice. Panic predicted (positively) Self-preservation. A series of mediation analyses found that Anxiety mediated relationships between threat and coping behaviors, and that Panic mediated the relationship between perceived threats and Self-preservation. In addition, we found that scores on all measures, except Panic, increased following the announcement of the first COVID-19 related fatality in Poland, which occurred on the third (middle) day of the study. The mediational relationships we found did not vary as a function of whether the data were collected before or after this announcement. The present results suggest that emotional reactions to perceived threats can serve an instrumental function by providing the motivation to engage in coping behaviors. Such a mechanism complements much research on stress that has focused on how coping mediates threat-emotion relationships.","Cypryanska, Marzena; Nezlek, John B",PLoS One,661,15

We explore people's perception of the role of food consumption as a preventive measure and how it reconfigures consumption habits. METHOD AND RESULTS: We conducted an online survey of a representative sample of 1004 Italian citizens. Around 40% of the population perceive that strengthening the immune defences through nutrition is not important to reduce the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. People with lower levels of perceived importance are slightly younger and have a less healthy lifestyle. They are less worried about the emergency. During the last months, they have bought less food supplements and also intend to decrease their purchase in the next 6 months. CONCLUSION: In COVID-19 pandemic, scholars underline the importance of having a strong immune system. However, the Italians who attribute less importance to food that helps the immune system seem to differ negatively in their psychological attitude towards the emergency and food consumption. Today, Italians are asked to engage in preventive food practices to protect against possible chronic diseases; exploring their perceptions is important to orient them towards this change.","Savarese, Mariarosaria; Castellini, Greta; Morelli, Lorenzo; Graffigna, Guendalina",Nutr. metab. cardiovasc. dis,661,20

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Population-based study including subjects resident in the province of Milan and Lodi. PARTICIPANTS: 127 735 residents older than 70 years, with specific chronic conditions. INTERVENTIONS: We developed a predictive algorithm for overall mortality risk based on demographic and clinical characteristics. All residents older than 70 years were classified as being at low or high risk of death from COVID-19 infection according to the algorithm. The high-risk group was assigned to their GPs for telephone triage and consultation. The high-risk cohort was divided into two groups based on GP intervention: patients who were not contacted and patients who were contacted by their GPs. OUTCOME MEASURES: Overall mortality, COVID-19 morbidity and hospitalisation. RESULTS: Patients with increased risk of death from COVID-19 were 127 735; 495 669 patients were not at high risk and were not included in the intervention. Out of the high-risk subjects, 79 110 were included but not contacted by their GPs, while 48 625 high-risk subjects were included and contacted. Overall mortality, morbidity and hospitalisation was higher in high-risk patients compared with low-risk populations. High-risk patients contacted by their GPs had a 50% risk reduction in COVID-19 mortality, and a 70% risk reduction in morbidity and hospitalisation for COVID-19 compared with non-contacted patients. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that, during the COVID-19 outbreak, involvement of GPs and changes in care management of high-risk groups produced a significant reduction in all adverse health outcomes.","Russo, Antonio Giampiero; Faccini, Marino; Bergamaschi, Walter; Riussi, Antonio",BMJ Open,661,16

Here, we analyzed mutation patterns in 34 human SARS-CoV-2 isolates and a closely related RaTG13 isolated from Rhinolophus affinis (a horseshoe bat). We also evaluated the CpG dinucleotide contents in SARS-CoV-2 and other human and animal coronavirus genomes. Out of 1136 single nucleotide variations (~4% divergence) between human SARS-CoV-2 and bat RaTG13, 682 (60%) can be attributed to C>U and U>C substitutions, far exceeding other types of substitutions. An accumulation of C>U mutations was also observed in SARS-CoV2 variants that arose within the human population. Globally, the C>U substitutions increased the frequency of codons for hydrophobic amino acids in SARS-CoV-2 peptides, while U>C substitutions decreased it. In contrast to most other coronaviruses, both SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 exhibited CpG depletion in their genomes. The data suggest that C-to-U conversion mediated by C deamination played a significant role in the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. We hypothesize that the high frequency C>U transitions reflect virus adaptation processes in their hosts, and that SARS-CoV-2 could have been evolving for a relatively long period in humans following the transfer from animals before spreading worldwide.","Matyásek, Roman; Kovarík, Ales",,661,1

Methods: Retrospective analysis was performed on the data of patients with fever who received chest CT and new coronavirus nucleal acid test during January 25, 2020 to February 2, 2020 in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. A total of 587 patients were enrolled, including 290 males and 297 females, aged from 11.0 to 96.0 (51.3±17.1) years old. Taking the nucleic acid test results as the gold standard, the sensitivity, specificity and rate of misdiagnosis of CT screening were calculated. Results: Among the 587 patients, there were 433 positive cases (73.8%, 433/587) and 154 negative cases (26.2%, 154/587) of novel coronavirus nucleic acid test. Using CT screening, 494 cases (84.2%, 494/587) were positive and 93 cases (15.8%, 93/587) were negative. The sensitivity of CT screening was 97.7% (423/433), specificity was 53.9% (83/154) and rate of misdiagnosis was 2.3% (10/433). Conclusions: In the early COVID-19 outbreak, CT screening has the advantages of high sensitivity and low rate of misdiagnosis, which can compensate for the shortage of new coronavirus nucleal acid test and can be used as a rapid screening for early prevention and control.","Deng, Zhiqing; Zhang, Xiaochun; Li, Yirong; Xu, Haibo; Gang, Yadong; Wang, Hanlun; Liao, Rufang; Jin, Yinghui; Wang, Xinghuan; Zeng, Xiantao; Luo, Shihua; Pan, Zhenyu",Chin.

To date, however, the role played by the drainage system of a high-rise building in the virus transmission is not clear and especially studies on the dynamics mechanism behind is scarce. From this point of view, the present work carries out a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling to investigate the effects of the water seal effectiveness of the floor drain, the negative/positive pressures (P 1 , P 2 ) in the bathroom, temperature differential (&#916;T), outside wind velocity (v), the piping fittings and the negative pressure at the cowl (P 3 ) on the transmission of the virus-laden aerosol particles in a drainage system of a typical 7-storeys residential building. The CFD models are first validated by the previous experiments in literature. Numerical results imply that the drainage system might play an essential role to the virus transmission. Then, results indicate that, the leakage risk of the aerosol particles via the floor drain with inefficient water-seal (UFD) mainly exists at the upper floors above the neutral pressure level (NPL). Besides, the negative and positive pressures at the bathroom can enhance and reduce the exposure risk of aerosol particles from the corresponding UFD, respectively. The &#916;T increasing does not modify the location of the NPL. Moreover, the exposure risk of aerosol particles can be effectively avoided by the well water-sealed floor drains and/or the presence of a proper negative pressure at the cowl on the top floor. Finally, based on the CFD results, several protection suggestions on the drainage system and human activities are provided.","Zhang, Yuan; Wang, Yikang; Wang, Feifei; Xu, Xinhua; Wu, Xiaohui",Build Environ,661,27

The current COVID-2019 pandemic is prompting fear of falling sick, dying, helplessness and stigma, urgent and timely understanding of mental health status is needed to help the community. Our investigation designed to survey the general population in Saudi Arabia to assess the degree of psychological impact during the pandemic. METHODS: During the early stage of the outbreak, we conducted an online-based survey using a snowballing sample technique. The surveys collected data about several aspects of participant sociodemographic, knowledge, concerns, psychological impact, and mental health status. We assessed the psychological impact and mental health status using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). RESULTS: Our survey recruited 1160 respondents of the general public of Saudi Arabia. Of them, 23.6% reported moderate or severe psychological impact of the outbreak, 28.3%,24%, and 22.3% reported moderate to severe depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms, respectively. Females reported IES-R (B: 5.46, 95% CI: 3.61 to 7.31) and DASS subscales B coefficient ranged from 1.65 to 2.63, along with high-school students, working in the medical field, and poor self-reported health status was significantly associated with a high level of IES-R and DASS scales (p < .05). Experiencing breathing difficulty and dizziness showed a stronger association with higher IES-R and DASS subscales than other somatic symptoms (e.g., headache and fever);(p < .001). Respondents who practiced specific preventative measures (e.g., hand washing, social distancing) demonstrated a protective effect against stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms. Social distancing appeared to be protective on stress and anxiety subscales (B: -1.49, 95% CI: -2.79 to -0.19),(B: -1.53, 95% CI: -2.50 to -0.57),respectively; and hand hygiene on depression subscale (B: -2.43, 95% CI: -4.44 to -0.42). CONCLUSION: Throughout the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak in Saudi Arabia, the results showed that nearly one-fourth of the sampled general population experienced moderate to severe psychological impact. Following specific precautionary measures appeared to have a protective effect on the individual's mental health. Our findings can be used to construct psychological interventions directed toward vulnerable populations and to implement public mental health strategies in the early stages of the outbreak.","Alkhamees, Abdulmajeed A; Alrashed, Saleh A; Alzunaydi, Ali A; Almohimeed, Ahmed S; Aljohani, Moath S",Compr Psychiatry,661,11

The literature reveals that nurses have ascribed a diversity of interpretations to spirituality. However, no studies have investigated how registered nurses construct their understanding of spirituality using a critical discourse analysis approach. Therefore, the aim of this study was to uncover how registered nurses construct their understanding of spirituality using a critical discourse analysis approach. Twenty registered nurses from a non-denominational public hospital and a faith-based private hospital were interviewed about their understanding of spirituality and practice of spiritual care. A critical discourse analysis approach was used in the examination of the interview texts to uncover underlying social and power features. Links were made between the linguistic features the registered nurses used in their interviews and the broader social context of the study. Three discourses emerged from the interview texts. These include constructing spirituality through personal religious beliefs discourse, holistic discourse and empathetic care discourse.

Nucleic acid testing using real time PCR platform has been a diagnostic gold standard to identify infected individuals during early stage of infection. On the other hand, serological test to capture antibody against SARS-CoV-2 may be useful for immunosurveillance. Discovery of human ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme) protein as an obligate partner of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry has provided insights to mechanisms of serious post-infection ramifications to individuals having comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes or heart conditions. When the enemy reaches ashore, thorough profiling of biomarkers involved in inflammation and coagulation (IL-6, lymphopenia, ground glass opacity, d-dimers, thrombocytopenia) may help predict disease progression and guide treatment strategy. While estimated 80% of infected individuals may recover on their own, the remaining 20% may require hospitalization and serious therapeutic intervention. Several clinical trials are underway such as repurposing existing drugs and evaluating efficacy of convalescence plasma therapy. Finally, vaccine development using genetic engineering may also help control the global spread if it is proven effective.","Utomo, Ahmad",Journal Of Biomedicine And Translational Research,661,0

Since then, all hospitals have required a complete restructuring of their usual facilities and the treatments provided. Our goal was to detail the remodeling of a tertiary hospital during the COVID-19 outbreak and analyze pitfalls to avoid increasing surgical department burdens. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of data affecting patients during their admission in our institution during March 2020. Data from general admission, intensive care units, and elective and emergency surgeries were collected and analyzed. All patients who underwent a surgical procedure were reviewed to elucidate limitations in the deployment of the hospital transformation to a COVID-19 hospital. RESULTS: A total of 688 patients have been treated in our institution. Of those, 186 required intensive care. More than 120 new intensive care beds have been created during this period, and a decrease in elective surgeries of more than 75% was observed. Inadvertent COVID-19 patients accounted for 70%. Thirty percent of the patients who underwent surgery while infected with COVID-19 died in our institution. CONCLUSIONS: The complete reorganization of surgical departments will be requested during the outbreak and adaptive solutions are needed in order to avoid increased mortality rates and infection among patients and to promote maximal optimization of surgical spaces. Timing, governmental decisions, and scientific society's recommendations may be limitations in the efficient deployment of hospital transformations to COVID-19 facilities.","Vilallonga, Ramon; Garcia Ruiz de Gordejuela, Amador; Cossio-Gil, Yolima; Domínguez González, José Manuel; Martín Sánchez, Rocio; Armengol Carrasco, Manel",Langenbeck&#039;s arch. surg,661,20

Differing movement restrictions across countries have affected changes in consumers' food practices, with a potentially detrimental impact on their health and food systems. To investigate this, this research explored changes in consumers' food practices during the initial COVID-19 phase and assessed the impact of location on these changes. A sample of 2360 adults from three continents (Island of Ireland (IOI), Great Britain (GB), United States (USA), and New Zealand (NZ)) were recruited for a cross-sectional online survey (May-June 2020). Participants completed questions in relation to their cooking and food practices, diet quality, and COVID-19 food-related practices. Significant changes in consumers' food practices during the pandemic were seen within and between regions, with fewer cooking practices changes found in the USA. Food practices, which may put added pressure on the food system, such as bulk buying, were seen across all regions. To prevent this, organisational food practices, including planning ahead, should be emphasized. Additionally, while positive cooking-related practices and increases in fruit and vegetable intake were found, an increase in saturated fat intake was also seen. With the additional pressure on individuals' physical and mental health, the essentiality of maintaining a balanced diet should be promoted.","Murphy, Blain; Benson, Tony; McCloat, Amanda; Mooney, Elaine; Elliott, Chris; Dean, Moira; Lavelle, Fiona",Nutrients,661,18

Here we report an in-depth molecular analysis to reconstruct the evolutionary origins of the enhanced pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses that are severe human pathogens. Using integrated comparative genomics and machine learning techniques, we identify key genomic features that differentiate SARS-CoV-2 and the viruses behind the two previous deadly coronavirus outbreaks, SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), from less pathogenic coronaviruses. These features include enhancement of the nuclear localization signals in the nucleocapsid protein and distinct inserts in the spike glycoprotein that appear to be associated with high case fatality rate of these coronaviruses as well as the host switch from animals to humans. The identified features could be crucial contributors to coronavirus pathogenicity and possible targets for diagnostics, prognostication, and interventions.","Gussow, Ayal B; Auslander, Noam; Faure, Guilhem; Wolf, Yuri I; Zhang, Feng; Koonin, Eugene V",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,661,1

We assessed several inhibitors of the enzymes pertaining to sphingolipid metabolism, against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S)-mediated cell-cell fusion and viral infection. N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) retinamide (4-HPR), an inhibitor of dihydroceramide &#916;4-desaturase 1 (DES1), suppressed cell-cell fusion, and viral infection. The analysis of sphingolipid levels revealed that the inhibition efficiencies of cell-cell fusion and viral infection in 4-HPR-treated cells were consistent with an increased ratio of saturated sphinganine-based lipids to total sphingolipids. We investigated the relationship of DES1 with the inhibition efficiencies of cell-cell fusion. The changes in the sphingolipid profile induced by 4-HPR were mitigated by the supplementation with exogenous cell-permeable ceramide; however, the reduced cell-cell fusion could not be reversed. The efficiency of cell-cell fusion in DES1 knockout (KO) cells was at a level comparable to that in wild-type (WT) cells; however, the ratio of saturated sphinganine-based lipids to the total sphingolipids was higher in DES1 KO cells, compared to that in WT cells. 4-HPR reduced cell membrane fluidity without any significant effects on the expression or localization of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the SARS-CoV-2 receptor. Therefore, 4-HPR suppresses SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated membrane fusion through a DES1-independent mechanism, and this decrease in membrane fluidity induced by 4-HPR could be the major cause for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Importance Sphingolipids could play an important role in SARS-CoV-2 S-meditated membrane fusion with host cells. We studied the cell-cell fusion using SARS-CoV-2 S expressing cells and sphingolipid-manipulated target cells, with an inhibitor of the sphingolipid metabolism. 4-HPR (also known as fenretinide) is an inhibitor of DES1 and it exhibits antitumor activity and suppresses cell-cell fusion and viral infection. 4-HPR suppresses membrane fusion through a decrease in membrane fluidity, which could possibly be the cause for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection. There is accumulating clinical data on the safety of 4-HPR. Therefore, it could be a potential candidate drug against COVID-19.","Hayashi, Yasuhiro; Tsuchiya, Kiyoto; Yamamoto, Mizuki; Nemoto-Sasaki, Yoko; Tanigawa, Kazunari; Hama, Kotaro; Ueda, Yusuke; Tanikawa, Takashi; Gohda, Jin; Maeda, Kenji; Inoue, Jun-Ichiro; Yamashita, Atsushi",J Virol,661,30

The purpose of this study was to clarify the significance of PNI as a prognostic factor for early-stage clear cell ovarian carcinoma. A total of 82 patients with stage I-II (FIGO 2014) ovarian clear cell carcinoma undergoing primary surgery at our hospital from January 2005 to December 2017 were enrolled. PNI was calculated using the formula: 10 × serum albumin (g/ dL) + 0.005 × peripheral blood lymphocyte count (/mm3). Preoperative PNI exhibited relatively high area under the curve value (0.709) for 5 year survival, and the optimal cutoff value was 46.5. The overall survival was significantly shorter in the PNI-low group than in the PNI-high group. Multivariate analysis showed that high PNI was a significant independent prognostic factor for favorable prognosis (hazard ratio = 0.102, p = 0.010). There was no significant difference in recurrence-free survival between the two groups (p = 0.220), but the postrecurrence survival was significantly longer in the PNI-high group than in the PNI-low group (p = 0.0383). The preoperative PNI was a useful predictor of prognosis, even in early-stage ovarian clear cell carcinoma.","Yoshikawa, Nobuhisa; Yoshida, Kosuke; Tamauchi, Satoshi; Ikeda, Yoshiki; Nishino, Kimihiro; Niimi, Kaoru; Suzuki, Shiro; Kikkawa, Fumitaka; Kajiyama, Hiroaki",Sci Rep,661,16

Reductions in white cell counts, driven by lower levels of lymphocytes, have been observed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Neutropenia during COVID-19 has not been reported. We present data for 56 patients who were taking clozapine and had COVID-19. Methods: We included patients who were taking clozapine at the time they tested positive for COVID-19. We compared absolute neutrophil counts, lymphocyte counts and white cell counts between baseline and the first week of infection, and baseline and the second week of infection. Results: We observed reductions in absolute neutrophil counts (p = 0.005), lymphocyte counts (p = 0.003) and white cell counts (p < 0.001) between baseline and the first 7 days of COVID-19. All cell counts had returned to baseline levels by days 8 to 14. Six patients experienced neutropenia (absolute neutrophil counts < 2.0 × 109/L) and of those, 4 underwent mandatory cessation of clozapine. For 3 patients, clozapine treatment had been established for more than 6 months with no previous neutropenia, neutrophil levels returned to baseline within 2 weeks and no further neutropenia was observed on restarting treatment. Limitations: This was a retrospective chart review; larger cohorts are required. Clozapine plasma levels were largely not measured by clinicians. Conclusion: These data strongly suggest that mild neutropenia in the acute phase of COVID-19 in patients who are well established on clozapine is more likely to be a consequence of the virus than of clozapine treatment.","Gee, Siobhan; Taylor, David",J Psychiatry Neurosci,661,29

The purpose of this ecological study is to analyse the effect of the different socioeconomic, demographic and healthcare determinants on the mortality rate and estimated cumulative incidence of COVID-19 first wave in the Spanish regions. METHODS: From the available data of the 17 Spanish regions (Autonomous Communities), we have carried out an ecological study through multivariate linear regression using ordinary least squares. To do this, we conducted an analysis using two distinct dependent variables: the logarithm of mortality rate per 1,000,000 inhabitants and the estimated cumulative incidence. The study has 12 explanatory variables. RESULTS: After applying the backward stepwise multivariate analysis, we obtained a model with nine significant variables at different levels for mortality rate and a model with seven significant variables for estimated cumulative incidence. Among them, six variables are statistically significant and of the same sign in both models: ""Nursing homes beds"", ""Proportion of care homes over 100 beds"", ""Log GDP per capita"", ""Aeroplane passengers"", ""Proportion of urban people"", and the dummy variable ""Island region"".

Drawing on the health belief model, perceived scarcity, and anticipated regret theories, this paper formulated a theoretical model that linked the determinants of panic buying and analyzed their interrelationships. Subsequently, data were collated from 508 consumers through an online survey questionnaire in Singapore that was conducted during the early stage of the pandemic, before the onset of the circuit breaker in April 2020. Next, an analysis of the results was done through structural equation modeling. It showed that the effect of the health belief model dimensions (i.e., perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, outcome expectation, cues to action, and self-efficacy) on panic buying is partially mediated by the consumers' perceived scarcity of products. Furthermore, the effect of perceived scarcity on panic buying is partially mediated by consumers' anticipation of regret. This paper expands on the current theoretical understanding of panic buying behavior, giving insights into the possible measures and solutions that policymakers and relevant stakeholders can uptake to manage panic buying in future a pandemic or health crisis.","Chua, Grace; Yuen, Kum Fai; Wang, Xueqin; Wong, Yiik Diew",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),661,6

It is anticipated that the number of remote consultations will grow in the forthcoming months.This audit creates an opportunity to develop a new policy and improve the quality of remote consultations documentation.ResultDocumentation for remote consultation was done in 81% of case notes whereas documentation of consent obtained was present in 57% of patients’ electronic notes.90% of entries had documentation of ‘addressed concerns’. Around 50-70% of patients’ documents showed good record keeping on domains of ‘ability to maintain effective communication’, ‘mental state examination’, ‘risk assessment’ and ‘ability to understand medication plus side effects’.About 40% of documentation met standards for good record keeping on ‘management plan’, ‘concerns raised’, ‘chance given to ask about management plan’.ConclusionMost of the standards of good consultations are being met despite the change in the type of Consultation due to COVID-19. However, there are identified areas for improvement which could be focused on. For example, documentation can be clearer when consent is gained for remote consultation. It should not be presumed that, as patients are booked in a certain type of clinic, they have been properly consented beforehand.Key Success: Almost in all domains 40% have met the standardsKey Concerns: There are areas where a lot of evidence is partially documented.The above results can be explained as a consequence of a sudden change in the normal working pattern in a community-based setting, having minimal protocols and procedures on standards of working in the situation of COVID19 remote consultation.Following this audit, we aim to increase the amount of information recorded during remote consultation.The plan is to develop a template that would cover the requirements for a remote consultation recommended by national guidelinesThe proposal of a letter template following a remote consultation will be disseminated to the MHSOP CMHT teams for any suggestions/approval.","Das, Astha Kuklewicz Margaret",BJPsych Open,661,24

A special nursing group of transdisciplinary nurses (TNs) who had not worked in respiratory medicine, infection departments, or emergency and intensive medicine but who accounted for a large proportion of all nurses also drew our attention. Few studies have examined this special group of TNs. Therefore, this study collected the experiences and views of TNs at the forefront of the COVID-19 outbreak to investigate their potential problems. RESULTS: Twenty-five TNs and 19 nurses with experience in infectious diseases (non-TNs) were enrolled in the study. Compared with non-TNs, TNs showed higher levels of perceived stress and relatively less perceived social support. For TNs, the ambiguous roles, transition of operating mode, unfamiliar work content, and reversal of their daily schedule were the most common vocational problems. Additionally, most TNs had psychological problems such as anxiety, pain and insomnia. The incomprehension of parents, concern for family members and long-term isolation were the most common causes of psychological stress. CONCLUSION: This survey is the first to focus on the group of TNs at the forefront of the COVID-19 outbreak and to investigate their experiences, vocational issues and psychological stresses qualitatively and quantificationally. We found that TNs had more perceived stress and less perceived social support than non-TNs. The vocational and psychological issues of TNs should be highlighted. These findings identify important issues and offer insights into the underlying issues to help TNs ultimately win the battle against novel coronavirus epidemics. METHODS: Semi-structured and face-to-face individual interviews and quantitative assessments were conducted. The Braun Clarke Thematic Analysis method and the strategy outlined by Miles and Huberman were used in the data analysis process of the qualitative study. The perceived stress scale and perceived social support scale were utilized to quantificationally evaluate the perceived stress level and the amount of perceived social support. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were adopted to assess the vocational and psychological perceptions and issues.","Fan, Jing; Hu, Kaihui; Li, Xueqin; Jiang, Ying; Zhou, Xiang; Gou, Xin; Li, Xinyuan",Aging (Albany NY),661,24

Vitamin D is a known risk factor for COVID-19. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the association of prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and mean vitamin D level with COVID-19 infection and mortality in Asia, predicting with other confounding factors such as median age, obesity, and diabetes. METHODS: COVID-19 infections and mortalities among the Asian countries were retrieved from the Worldometer website. Information on prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and mean vitamin D values in each Asian country was retrieved through literature searching on PubMed® and Google scholar. The associations between COVID-19 infections and mortalities with prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and mean vitamin D level were explored with correlation coefficients. As a predictive analysis, multiple linear regression was carried out with all confounders. RESULTS: Positive correlations were observed for prevalence of vitamin D deficiency with COVID-19 infections (r = 0.55; p = 0.01; R2 = 0.31) and mortalities (r = 0.50; p = 0.01; R2 = 0.25). Moreover, the associations for the COVID-19 infections and mortalities improved to r = 0.76 (p = 0.002; R2 = 0.58) and r = 0.65 (p = 0.03; R2 = 0.42), respectively, after predicting with confounding factors. Similarly, mean vitamin D level had a significant negative correlation with COVID-19 infections (r = -0.77; p = 0.04; R2 = 0.59) and mortalities (r = -0.80; p = 0.03; R2 = 0.63) when combining with confounders. CONCLUSION: Prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is significantly positively associated whereas the mean vitamin D level is significantly negatively associated with both infection and mortality rate of COVID-19 among Asian countries upon predicting with all confounders.","Jayawardena, Ranil; Jeyakumar, Dhanushya T; Francis, Tormalli V; Misra, Anoop",Diabetes Metab Syndr,661,11

Humans consume CQAs in mg-to-gram quantities through dietary consumption of plant products. CQAs are considered beneficial for human health, mainly due to their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Recently, new biosynthetic pathways via a peroxidase-type p-coumaric acid 3-hydroxylase enzyme were discovered. More recently, a new GDSL lipase-like enzyme able to transform monoCQAs into diCQA was identified in Ipomoea batatas. CQAs were recently linked to memory improvement; they seem to be strong indirect antioxidants via Nrf2 activation. However, there is a prevalent confusion in the designation and nomenclature of different CQA isomers. Such inconsistencies are critical and complicate bioactivity assessment since different isomers differ in bioactivity and potency. A detailed explanation regarding the origin of such confusion is provided, and a recommendation to unify nomenclature is suggested. Furthermore, for studies on CQA bioactivity, plant-based laboratory animal diets contain CQAs, which makes it difficult to include proper control groups for comparison. Therefore, a synthetic diet free of CQAs is advised to avoid interferences since some CQAs may produce bioactivity even at nanomolar levels. Biotransformation of CQAs by gut microbiota, the discovery of new enzymatic biosynthetic and metabolic pathways, dietary assessment, and assessment of biological properties with potential for drug development are areas of active, ongoing research. This review is focused on the chemistry, biosynthesis, occurrence, analytical challenges, and bioactivity recently reported for mono-, di-, tri-, and tetraCQAs.","Alcázar Magaña, Armando; Kamimura, Naofumi; Soumyanath, Amala; Stevens, Jan F; Maier, Claudia S",Plant j,661,14

Disease modellers have historically placed much more emphasis on strength, in part because the effectiveness of an intervention strategy is typically evaluated on this scale. Here, we develop a mathematical framework for the classic, strength-based paradigm and show that there is a dual speed-based paradigm which can provide complementary insights. In particular, we note that r = 0 is a threshold for disease spread, just like [Formula: see text] [ 1], and show that we can measure the strength and speed of an intervention on the same scale as the strength and speed of an epidemic, respectively. We argue that, while the strength-based paradigm provides the clearest insight into certain questions, the speed-based paradigm provides the clearest view in other cases. As an example, we show that evaluating the prospects of 'test-and-treat' interventions against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can be done more clearly on the speed than strength scale, given uncertainty in the proportion of HIV spread that happens early in the course of infection. We also discuss evaluating the effects of the importance of pre-symptomatic transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We suggest that disease modellers should avoid over-emphasizing the reproductive number at the expense of the exponential growth rate, but instead look at these as complementary measures.","Dushoff, Jonathan; Park, Sang Woo",Proc Biol Sci,661,20

Nevertheless, interesting legal questions about the possibility of mandatory COVID-19 vaccination arose. This article explores the possible legal frameworks for implementing a mandatory vaccination scheme in Australia as well as the associated ethical dilemmas. Furthermore, it argues that a mandatory vaccination scheme, while possible and arguably ethical, would have undesirable implications resulting in popular opposition and decreased compliance with other voluntary vaccines such as childhood vaccination and seasonal influenza. Consequently, a voluntary scheme based on incentives and transparent provision of information is much more likely to achieve the desired uptake.","Fisher, M. R.",J Law Med,661,14

Meanwhile, few studies focused on the mid-term sequelae, which still remain largely unknown. AIM: To assess the physical performance of COVID-19 survivors at 3 to 6 months from Hospital discharge. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study focused on mid-term functional outcomes evaluation in COVID-19 survivors. SETTING: Outpatients who had been previously hospitalized due to COVID-19 from March to May 2020 at the University Hospital of Novara (Italy). POPULATION: We enrolled 204 patients, of which 60% were men, with the mean age of 57.9 years. METHODS: Patients firstly underwent the Short Physical Performance Battery test (SPPB), which is composed of a series of physical tests assessing the lower limb function and the functional status of the subjects. Subsequently, based on SPPB results, patients' cardiorespiratory fitness performance was further investigated. Patients with normal SPPB score (SPPB > 10) underwent the 2-Minute Walking test (2MWT) whereas, in order to safely test the cardiorespiratory function, in patients with abnormal SPPB score (SPPB &#8804; 10) the 1-Minute-Sit-to-Stand Test (1MSTST) was performed. It should be noted that the 1MSTST can be safely performed even by subjects with compromised walking ability. RESULTS: Overall, 66 patients (32% of our sample) showed an impaired physical performance at 3 to 6 months after hospital discharge. In particular, 29 patients presented an SPPB score &#8804; 10, and the 1MSTST confirmed this status in the whole group (100%) compared to the reference values for age and sex. Besides, among patients with a normal SPPB score, 37 showed a lower sex- and age-matched 2MWT score. Finally, a significant association between Intensive Care Unit hospitalization or mechanical ventilation and physical impairment was observed together with a significant association between the walking ability (measured with SPPB and 2MWT) and the number of comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: A residual physical and functional impairment was observed in COVID-19 survivors at mid-term evaluation after hospitalization. CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: Considering the current COVID-19 epidemiology, we might expect a tremendous burden of disability in the next future. Thus, an appropriate clinical rehabilitation pathway must be implemented.","Baricich, Alessio; Borg, Margherita B; Cuneo, Daria; Cadario, Emanuela; Azzolina, Danila; Balbo, Piero E; Bellan, Mattia; Zeppegno, Patrizia; Pirisi, Mario; Cisari, Carlo",Eur. j. phys. rehabil. med.

Machine Learning (ML) models trained with the available data, which is limited in quantity and poor in diversity, will often be biased and inaccurate. At the same time, ML algorithms designed to fight pandemics must have good performance and be developed in a time-sensitive manner. To tackle the challenges of limited data, and label scarcity in the available data, we propose generating conditional synthetic data, to be used alongside real data for developing robust ML models. $\textbf{Methods:}$ We present a hybrid model consisting of a conditional generative flow and a classifier for conditional synthetic data generation. The classifier decouples the feature representation for the condition, which is fed to the flow to extract the local noise. We generate synthetic data by manipulating the local noise with fixed conditional feature representation. We also propose a semi-supervised approach to generate synthetic samples in the absence of labels for a majority of the available data. $\textbf{Results:}$ We performed conditional synthetic generation for chest computed tomography (CT) scans corresponding to normal, COVID-19, and pneumonia afflicted patients. We show that our method significantly outperforms existing models both on qualitative and quantitative performance, and our semi-supervised approach can efficiently synthesize conditional samples under label scarcity.

By allowing remote communication, teleconsultation may help limit the spread of the virus while maintaining the crucial patient-provider relationship. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the value of teleconsultation compared to in-person visits in the management of elective orthopaedic and spinal procedures. METHODS: This was a prospective observational cohort study of 853 patients receiving orthopaedic and spinal care at a private outpatient clinic in New Zealand. Patients were randomly divided into two groups: (1) patients receiving telephone consultation remotely; and (2) patients receiving in-person office consultations at the outpatient clinic. All patients received telephone consultations for four weeks during the mandated COVID-19 lockdown, followed by four weeks of telephone or in-person consultation. Patient preference, satisfaction, and duration of visit were recorded. Comparisons of patient preference between groups, visit type, sex, and location were performed using Chi-square tests; similarly, satisfaction scores and visit durations were compared using a general linear model. RESULTS: We report that 91% of patients in the telephone group preferred teleconsultation over in-person office visits during the COVID-19 lockdown (P<.001). A combined-group analysis shows that 55.3% of all patients preferred teleconsultation compared to 31.2% who preferred in-person office visits (P<.001). Patients in the telephone group reported significantly higher satisfaction scores (9.95 +/- 0.04, 95% CI [9.87-10.03]) compared to patients in the in-person group (9.53 +/- 0.04, 95% CI [9.45-9.62]; P<.001). Additionally, in-person consultations were significantly longer in duration compared to telephone consultations, with a mean visit time of 6.70 min +/-0.18, 95% CI [6.32-7.02] compared to 5.10 min +/-0.17, 95% CI [4.73-5.42], respectively (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients who utilize telephone consultations are more likely to prefer it over traditional, in-person visits in the future. This increased preference, coupled with higher patient satisfaction scores and shorter duration of visits, suggests that teleconsultation has a role in orthopaedic surgery, which may even extend beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","Melian, Christina; Frampton, Christopher; Wyatt, Michael Charles; Kieser, David",,661,1

People living with SMI are at risk of premature mortality relative to people without SMI. Chronic medical illnesses contribute significantly to mortality among individuals with SMI. The standard of care for individuals with serious medical illnesses includes palliative care. However, the provision of palliative care has not been operationalized for individuals with SMI. OBJECTIVES: To review existing data on end-of-life and palliative care for individuals with serious medical illness and comorbid serious mental illness. To operationalize the role of the consultation-liaison (C-L) psychiatrist in such care, with a particular eye towards redressing disparities. METHODS: In this narrative review, we draw upon a review of the literature on end-of-life and palliative care provision for individuals with serious medical illness and comorbid serious medical illness. We also draw upon the experiences of the authors in formulating best practices for the care of such patients. RESULTS: Individuals with SMI are at risk of suboptimal end-of-life care. Patient, clinician, and system-level factors all contribute to disparities including decreased access to palliative care, uneven continued engagement with mental health services, and low rates of advance care planning. C-L psychiatrists can use their expertise at the intersection of medicine and psychiatry to address such disparities by (1) correcting misassumptions, (2) promoting advance care planning, (3) engaging long-term caregivers, (4) recognizing social needs, (5) ensuring ongoing access to psychiatric treatment, and (6) addressing suffering. CONCLUSIONS: There are significant disparities in the end-of-life care of individuals with SMI. C-L psychiatrists have expertise to ally with medical providers and redress these disparities.","Shalev, Daniel; Fields, Lauren; Shapiro, Peter A",Psychosomatics,661,20

However, data on COVID-19-related encephalitis and movement disorders are still limited. Herein, we describe the clinical and neuroimaging (FDG-PET/CT, MRI and DaT-SPECT) findings of two patients with COVID-19-related encephalopathy who developed prominent parkinsonism. None of the patients had previous history of parkinsonian signs/symptoms, and none had prodromal features of Parkinson's disease (hyposmia or RBD). Both developed a rapidly progressive form of atypical parkinsonism along with distinctive features suggestive of encephalitis. A possible immune-mediated etiology was suggested in Patient 2 by the presence of CSF-restricted oligoclonal bands, but none of the patients responded favorably to immunotherapy. Interestingly, FDG-PET/CT findings were similar in both cases and reminiscent of those observed in post-encephalitic parkinsonism, with cortical hypo-metabolism associated with hyper-metabolism in the brainstem, mesial temporal lobes, and basal ganglia. Patient's FDG-PET/CT findings were validated by performing a Statistical Parametric Mapping analysis and comparing the results with a cohort of healthy controls (n = 48). Cerebrum cortical thickness map was obtained in Patient 1 from MRI examinations to evaluate the structural correlates of the metabolic alterations detected with FDG-PET/CT. Hypermetabolic areas correlated with brain regions showing increased cortical thickness, suggesting their involvement during the inflammatory process. Overall, these observations suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection may trigger an encephalitis with prominent parkinsonism and distinctive brain metabolic alterations.","Morassi, Mauro; Palmerini, Francesco; Nici, Stefania; Magni, Eugenio; Savelli, Giordano; Guerra, Ugo Paolo; Chieregato, Matteo; Morbelli, Silvia; Vogrig, Alberto",J. neurol,661,20

These relationship networks can create value and resources for organizations and individuals. This current study aimed to explore the potential impact of workplace social capital on the association between perceived stress and professional identity in clinical nurses during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 308 Chinese clinical nurses filled out the Chinese Workplace Social Capital Scale, the Chinese Perceived Stress Scale, and the Chinese Nurse's Professional Identity Scale. Descriptive analysis, independent samples t test, analysis of variance, Pearson correlation analyses, and bootstrap method were performed to analyze the data. RESULTS: Perceived stress was negatively correlated with professional identity (r = -0.455, p < .001). Workplace social capital was not found to moderate the relationship between perceived stress and professional identity (95% CI -0.03 to- 0.06, p = .47 > .05). Instead, it mediated that relationship (95% CI -0.61 to -0.19, p < .05), and its mediating effect was -0.37. CONCLUSIONS: In the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak, workplace social capital among the investigated clinical nurses failed to buffer the negative impact of perceived stress on professional identity, but it did play a part in mediating perceived stress and professional identity. A healthy workplace should be provided to clinical nurses to improve their professional identity, while lowering perceived stress.","Zhang, Yu-Dong; Gao, Ya-Qin; Tang, Yan; Li, Yu-Hong",Jpn J Nurs Sci,661,20

There has been a reduction in clinical activities of residents. The purpose of this paper is to measure and compare the psychological well-being of dental versus medical residents during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study whereby trainees of a hospital in New York City were sent a questionnaire. Participants were from the dental and medical departments. Psychological measures of depression and post traumatic stress disorder were assessed utilizing the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) questionnaire. Other variables compared were age, gender, smoking status, living situation and comorbidities. Data analysis utilized chi-squared (X2) and t-tests. Bivariate correlation and linear regression analyses were also utilized. RESULTS: The survey was sent to 19 dental (Dental) and 171 medical (MD) residents. There were 66 participants. The response rate was 63.16 and 35.09% for the Dental and MD residents, respectively. The mean age for the Dental and MD residents, respectively, was 29.62 ± 2.09 and 34.82 ± 9.32 (P = .014). Eighty-one percent of the Dental respondents were male and 33.3% of the MD respondents were male (P < .001). The mean PHQ-9 score was 18.29 ± 2.88 vs 7.24 ± 7.41 for Dental and MD residents, respectively (P < .001). A higher score represents increased severity of depression. The Dental residents scored 61.9 ± 3.90 on the IES-R vs 30.36 ± 24.67 (P < .001). A higher score indicates a greater frequency of intrusive thoughts and avoidance. Forty-two percent of Dental and 13.3% of MD residents tested positive; 25% of Dental and 28.9% of MD residents self-reported symptoms for COVID-19. Being positive or symptomatic resulted in statistically significant higher IES-R and PHQ-9 scores.

The model is based on the numerical solution of the widely used Susceptible-Infectious-Removed (SIR) populations model for describing epidemics. We consider an expanded version of the original Kermack-McKendrick model, which includes a decaying value of the parameter β (the effective contact rate), interpreted as an effect of externally imposed conditions, to which we refer as the forced-SIR (FSIR) model. We introduce an approximate analytical solution to the differential equations that represent the FSIR model which gives very reasonable fits to real data for a number of countries over a period of 100 days (from the first onset of exponential increase, in China). The proposed model contains 3 adjustable parameters which are obtained by fitting actual data (up to April 28, 2020). We analyze these results to infer the physical meaning of the parameters involved. We use the model to make predictions about the total expected number of infections in each country as well as the date when the number of infections will have reached 99% of this total. We also compare key findings of the model with recently reported results on the high contagiousness and rapid spread of the disease.","Kaxiras, Efthimios; Neofotistos, Georgios; Angelaki, Eleni",Chaos Solitons Fractals,661,4

In addition, from the perspective of key stakeholders such as farmers, grain bank companies, and the government, we also studied the challenges of grain banks. We found that, in addition to providing many economic and social benefits in the form of food security and improved farmer income, grain banks still face many challenges in the new era. These include the ambiguity of property rights, lack of institutional structure, low efficiency of state-owned grain banks, and exploitation of loopholes by grain dealers. We propose to implement the supply-side reforms, clarify property rights, improve the supervision and management of grain banks, promote the privatization of grain banks, and take advantage of rural finance to realize the industrialization of the whole sector.","Li, Teng Zhou Deyi Wang Qing",Agriculture,661,22

This study examined the media accounts during that period by analysing the representation of death-related constructs in Corriere della Sera, the most widely read newspaper in Italy. A textual and thematic analysis of articles published between period A (epidemic: 23 January-22 February 2020) and period B (pandemic: 23 February-31 March 2020) was conducted using Nvivo-11. A total of 141 articles comprising 48,524 words were collected. The most utilised words and meanings linked to COVID-19 were computed. In the rank distribution, 'China' and 'virus' were the terms most frequently used in both periods. The terms 'death' and 'dead' were completely absent in period A and appeared in the 535th position in period B. The term 'dead' was used primarily to indicate the number of deceased. From a Terror Management Theory perspective, it is possible that the minimal reference to death-related issues was a reflection of death denial and a manifestation of efforts to deny death to manage terror. These findings highlight the ambiguities and ambivalence surrounding any issue pertaining to death; on the one side, undue alarmism may provoke exaggerated reactions, such as moral panic, while on the other denial-based messages that minimise references to mortality may reduce safe behaviour during a pandemic.","Solomon, Sheldon; Rostellato, Daniele; Testoni, Ines; Calabrese, Fiorella; Biasco, Guido",,661,33

Although YouTube facilitates easy access to hundreds of well-produced and trustworthy videos, abhorrent, misinformative, and mistargeted content is also common. The platform is plagued by various types of problematic content: 1) disturbing videos targeting young children; 2) hateful and misogynistic content; and 3) pseudoscientific misinformation. While YouTube's recommendation algorithm plays a vital role in increasing user engagement and YouTube's monetization, its role in unwittingly promoting problematic content is not entirely understood. In this thesis, we shed some light on the degree of problematic content on YouTube and the role of the recommendation algorithm in the dissemination of such content. Following a data-driven quantitative approach, we analyze thousands of videos on YouTube, to shed light on: 1) the risks of YouTube media consumption by young children; 2) the role of the recommendation algorithm in the dissemination of misogynistic content, by focusing on the Involuntary Celibates (Incels) community; and 3) user exposure to pseudoscientific content on various parts of the platform and how this exposure changes based on the user's watch history. Our analysis reveals that young children are likely to encounter disturbing content when they randomly browse the platform. By analyzing the Incel community on YouTube, we find that Incel activity is increasing over time and that platforms may play an active role in steering users towards extreme content. Finally, when studying pseudoscientific misinformation, we find that YouTube suggests more pseudoscientific content regarding traditional pseudoscientific topics (e.g., flat earth) than for emerging ones (like COVID-19) and that these recommendations are more common on the search results page than on a user's homepage or the video recommendations section.","Papadamou, Kostantinos",,661,25

The disease can cause life-threatening conditions and it presents challenges for medical education, as instructors must deliver lectures safely, while ensuring the integrity and continuity of the medical education process. It is therefore important to assess the usability of online learning methods, and to determine their feasibility and adequacy for medical students. We aimed to provide an overview of the situation experienced by medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to determine the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of medical students regarding electronic medical education. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with medical students from more than 13 medical schools in Libya. A paper-based and online survey was conducted using email and social media. The survey requested demographic and socioeconomic information, as well as information related to medical online learning and electronic devices; medical education status during the COVID-19 pandemic; mental health assessments; and e-learning knowledge, attitudes, and practices. A total of 3,348 valid questionnaires were retrieved. Most respondents (64.7%) disagreed that e-learning could be implemented easily in Libya. While 54.1% of the respondents agreed that interactive discussion is achievable by means of e-learning. However, only 21.1% agreed that e-learning could be used for clinical aspects, as compared with 54.8% who disagreed with this statement and 24% who were neutral. Only 27.7% of the respondents had participated in online medical educational programs during the COVID-19 pandemic, while 65% reported using the internet for participating in study groups and discussions. There is no vaccine for COVID-19 yet. As such, the pandemic will undeniably continue to disrupt medical education and training. As we face the prospect of a second wave of virus transmission, we must take certain measures and make changes to minimize the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on medical education and on the progression of training. The time for change is now, and there should be support and enthusiasm for providing valid solutions to reduce this disruption, such as online training and virtual clinical experience. These measures could then be followed by hands-on experience that is provided in a safe environment.","Alsoufi, Ahmed; Alsuyihili, Ali; Msherghi, Ahmed; Elhadi, Ahmed; Atiyah, Hana; Ashini, Aimen; Ashwieb, Arwa; Ghula, Mohamed; Ben Hasan, Hayat; Abudabuos, Salsabil; Alameen, Hind; Abokhdhir, Taqwa; Anaiba, Mohamed; Nagib, Taha; Shuwayyah, Anshirah; Benothman, Rema; Arrefae, Ghalea; Alkhwayildi, Abdulwajid; Alhadi, Abdulmueti; Zaid, Ahmed; Elhadi, Muhammed",PLoS One,661,1

During the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been interest in elderberry supplements to treat or prevent illness, but also concern that elderberry might overstimulate the immune system and increase the risk of 'cytokine storm'. We aimed to determine benefits and harms of elderberry for the prevention and treatment of viral respiratory infections, and to assess the relationship between elderberry supplements and negative health impacts associated with overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and searched six databases, four research registers, and two preprint sites for studies. Two reviewers independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data from studies, assessed risk of bias using Cochrane tools, and evaluated certainty of estimates using GRADE. Outcomes included new illnesses and the severity and duration of illness. RESULTS: We screened 1187 records and included five randomized trials on elderberry for the treatment or prevention of viral respiratory illness. We did not find any studies linking elderberry to clinical inflammatory outcomes. However, we found three studies measuring production of cytokines ex vivo after ingestion of elderberry. Elderberry may not reduce the risk of developing the common cold; it may reduce the duration and severity of colds, but the evidence is uncertain. Elderberry may reduce the duration of influenza but the evidence is uncertain. Compared to oseltamivir, an elderberry-containing product may be associated with a lower risk of influenza complications and adverse events. We did not find evidence on elderberry and clinical outcomes related to inflammation. However, we found evidence that elderberry has some effect on inflammatory markers, although this effect may decline with ongoing supplementation. One small study compared elderberry to diclofenac (a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) and provided some evidence that elderberry is as effective or less effective than diclofenac in cytokine reduction over time. CONCLUSIONS: Elderberry may be a safe option for treating viral respiratory illness, and there is no evidence that it overstimulates the immune system. However, the evidence on both benefits and harms is uncertain and information from recent and ongoing studies is necessary to make firm conclusions.","Wieland, L Susan; Piechotta, Vanessa; Feinberg, Termeh; Ludeman, Emilie; Hutton, Brian; Kanji, Salmaan; Seely, Dugald; Garritty, Chantelle",BMC Complement Med Ther,661,5

However, the virus' pathogenesis remains unclear, and there is no cure for the disease. We investigated the dynamic changes of blood immune response in patients with COVID-19 at different stages by using 5' gene expression, T cell receptor (TCR), and B cell receptors (BCR) V(D)J transcriptome analysis at a single-cell resolution. We obtained single-cell mRNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of 341,420 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and 185,430 clonotypic T cells and 28,802 clonotypic B cells from 25 samples of 16 patients with COVID-19 for dynamic studies. In addition, we used three control samples. We found expansion of dendritic cells (DCs), CD14+ monocytes, and megakaryocytes progenitor cells (MP)/platelets and a reduction of naïve CD4+ T lymphocytes in patients with COVID-19, along with a significant decrease of CD8+ T lymphocytes, and natural killer cells (NKs) in patients in critical condition. The type I interferon (IFN-I), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and ferroptosis pathways were activated while the disease was active, and recovered gradually after patient conditions improved. Consistent with this finding, the mRNA level of IFN-I signal-induced gene IFI27 was significantly increased in patients with COVID-19 compared with that of the controls in a validation cohort that included 38 patients and 35 controls. The concentration of interferon-&#945; (IFN-&#945;) in the serum of patients with COVID-19 increased significantly compared with that of the controls in an additional cohort of 215 patients with COVID-19 and 106 controls, further suggesting the important role of the IFN-I pathway in the immune response of COVID-19. TCR and BCR sequences analyses indicated that patients with COVID-19 developed specific immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 antigens.

The proposed approach, xDNN is using prototypes. Prototypes are actual training data samples (images), which are local peaks of the empirical data distribution called typicality as well as of the data density. This generative model is identified in a closed form and equates to the pdf but is derived automatically and entirely from the training data with no user- or problem-specific thresholds, parameters or intervention. The proposed xDNN offers a new deep learning architecture that combines reasoning and learning in a synergy. It is non-iterative and non-parametric, which explains its efficiency in terms of time and computational resources. From the user perspective, the proposed approach is clearly understandable to human users. We tested it on challenging problems as the classification of different lighting conditions for driving scenes (iROADS), object detection (Caltech-256, and Caltech-101), and SARS-CoV-2 identification via computed tomography scan (COVID CT-scans dataset). xDNN outperforms the other methods including deep learning in terms of accuracy, time to train and offers an explainable classifier.","Angelov, Plamen; Soares, Eduardo",Neural Netw,661,1

As hospitals continue to admit critical patients, they face medical equipment shortages that may hinder life-saving treatments. We seek to combat this equipment shortage by presenting a proof-of-concept portable automated ventilator that is simple, lightweight, and easy-to-fabricate based on an origami-inspired robotic approach. We discuss the design, fabrication, and initial testing of three such devices, two folded from a thin plastic film into a flexible bellows shape, and the other a 3D-printed version of the same design. We show that these initial designs satisfy most of the ventilator performance requirements for emergency portable automated use, with the 3D printed bellows being more flexible and capable of generating higher pressures. The next step is to expand our design and perform further testing to ensure our device is ready to save lives. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Aihaitijiang, A.; Chiang, S.

This document provides best practice statements and recommendations for consultative management based on a systematic review and meta-analysis of international data on GI and liver manifestations of COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search to identify published and unpublished studies using OVID Medline and preprint servers (medRxiv, LitCovid, and SSRN) up until April 5, 2020; major journal sites were monitored for US publications until April 19, 2020. We pooled the prevalence of diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, as well as liver function tests abnormalities, using a fixed-effect model and assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) framework. RESULTS: We identified 118 studies and used a hierarchal study selection process to identify unique cohorts. We performed a meta-analysis of 47 studies including 10,890 unique patients. Pooled prevalence estimates of GI symptoms were as follows: diarrhea 7.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.2%-8.2%), nausea/vomiting 7.8% (95% CI, 7.1%-8.5%), and abdominal pain 2.7% (95% CI, 2.0%-3.4%). Most studies reported on hospitalized patients. The pooled prevalence estimates of elevated liver abnormalities were as follows: aspartate transaminase 15.0% (95% CI, 13.6%-16.5%) and alanine transaminase 15.0% (95% CI, 13.6%-16.4%). When we compared studies from China to studies from other countries in subgroup analyses, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, and liver abnormalities were more prevalent outside of China, with diarrhea reported in 18.3% (95% CI, 16.6%-20.1%). Isolated GI symptoms were reported rarely. We also summarized the Gl and liver adverse effects of the most commonly utilized medications for COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: GI symptoms are associated with COVID-19 in <10% of patients. In studies outside of China, estimates are higher. Further studies are needed with standardized GI symptoms questionnaires and liver function test checks on admission to better quantify and qualify the association of these symptoms with COVID-19. Based on findings from our meta-analysis, we provide several Best Practice Statements for the consultative management of COVID-19.","Sultan, Shahnaz; Altayar, Osama; Siddique, Shazia M; Davitkov, Perica; Feuerstein, Joseph D; Lim, Joseph K; Falck-Ytter, Yngve; El-Serag, Hashem B",Gastroenterology,661,15

However, recommendations on how and when to preserve reproductive tissues and cells during a novel severe pandemic are scanty. This paper uses a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) analysis to identify favorable and unfavorable factors and to recognize challenges and obstacles related to the use of cryopreservation procedures during the spreading of a new virus. One of the strengths associated with the cryopreservation is represented by the availability of robust European guidelines on storage safety to prevent sample contamination or cross-contamination by pathogens. These recommendations should be deep-rooted in all ART laboratories. Weaknesses include uncertainties regarding the management of COVID-19 affected asymptomatic patients, the suboptimal accuracy of diagnostic tests for the disease, the nebulous prospective regarding the duration of the pandemic and the additional costs. The application of the strategy represents an opportunity to postpone pregnancy in order to avoid a severe infectious disease during gestation while concomitantly counteracting the possible detrimental effect of time.

The effective screening of suspected cases in the healthcare setting is therefore necessary, enabling the early identification and prompt isolation of cases for epidemic containment. We aimed to assess the cost and health outcomes of an extended screening strategy, implemented in Singapore on 07 February 2020, which maximizes case identification in the public healthcare system. METHODS: We explored the effects of the expanded screening criteria which allow clinicians to isolate and investigate patients presenting with undifferentiated fever or respiratory symptoms or chest x-ray abnormalities. We formulated a cost appraisal framework which evaluated the treatment costs averted from the prevention of secondary transmission in the hospital setting, as determined by a branching process infection model, and compared these to the costs of the additional testing required to meet the criteria. RESULTS: In the base case analysis, an R0 of 2.5 and incubation period of 4 days, an estimated 239 (95% CI: 201-287) cases could be averted over 150 days within the hospital setting through ESC. A corresponding $2.36 (2-2.85) million USD in costs could be averted with net cost savings of $124,000 (95% CI: -334,000 to 516,000). In the sensitivity analyses, when positive identification rates (PIR) were above 7%, regardless of R0 and incubation period, all scenarios were cost-saving. CONCLUSION: The expanded screening criteria can help to identify and promptly isolate positive COVID cases in a cost-saving manner or within acceptable cost margins where the costs incurred from the testing of negative patients could be negated by the averted costs. Outbreak control must be sustainable and effective; the proposed screening criteria should be considered to mitigate nosocomial transmission risk within healthcare facilities.","Lim, Jue Tao; Dickens, Borame L; Cook, Alex R; Khoo, Ai Leng; Dan, Yock Young; Fisher, Dale Andrew; Tambyah, Paul Anantharajah; Chai, Louis Yi Ann",Int J Infect Dis,661,18

Our risk depends on our temporal position, geographical location, social position, and the kind of society in which we live. We all contribute to environmental problems, but we do not contribute equally. About 11% of the world population is responsible for 50% of carbon emissions. These inequalities raise issues of justice because many of the people who are at high risk have contributed little to the problems.

The model achieved 0.846 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in predicting patients' outcomes averaged over 5-fold cross validation.

Recently, social tipping processes have received increased attention, as they present a form of social change whereby a small change can shift a sensitive social system into a qualitatively different state due to strongly self-amplifying (mathematically positive) feedback mechanisms. Social tipping processes have been suggested as key drivers of sustainability transitions emerging in the fields of technological and energy systems, political mobilization, financial markets and sociocultural norms and behaviors. Drawing from expert elicitation and comprehensive literature review, we develop a framework to identify and characterize social tipping processes critical to facilitating rapid social transformations. We find that social tipping processes are distinguishable from those of already more widely studied climate and ecological tipping dynamics. In particular, we identify human agency, social-institutional network structures, different spatial and temporal scales and increased complexity as key distinctive features underlying social tipping processes. Building on these characteristics, we propose a formal definition for social tipping processes and filtering criteria for those processes that could be decisive for future trajectories to global sustainability in the Anthropocene. We illustrate this definition with the European political system as an example of potential social tipping processes, highlighting the potential role of the FridaysForFuture movement. Accordingly, this analytical framework for social tipping processes can be utilized to illuminate mechanisms for necessary transformative climate change mitigation policies and actions.","Winkelmann, Ricarda; Donges, Jonathan F.; Smith, E.

Docking studies were performed for certain components of Egyptian Propolis using Avigan, Hydroxychloroquine and Remdesivir as standard antivirals against both COVID-19 3CL-protease and S1 spike protein. Response surface methodology and modified injection method were implemented to maximize the entrapment efficiency and release of the liposomal formulation. The optimized formulation parameters were as follow: LMC of 60 mM, CH% of 20% and DL of 5 mg/ml. At those values the E.E% and released % were 70.112% and 81.801%, respectively with nanosized particles (117 ± 11 nm).

Patients and Methods: COVID-19 began to effect surgical practices across the US in March 2020. On March 17, 2020, all elective and non-emergent surgical care was deferred to prepare the Mayo Clinic Health System sites in northwest Wisconsin for an anticipated surge in COVID-19 patients. When the decision was made to reactivate the surgical practice, several major structural and operational changes were made to the regional surgical practice to optimize efficiencies. Results: The structural and operational changes implemented during reactivation resulted in improved utilization of surgical resources including improvement in OR block utilization, increased available OR time, and increased case volumes. Conclusion: Surgical and procedural leaders should consider a limited-time deferral of elective surgical cases to implement widespread OR efficiency strategies. The time selected for deferral of surgical cases should target a historically low surgical volume to minimize disruption to patient care and impact on overall OR functions.","Martin-Krajewski, Carie A; Craig, Jason E; Bledsoe, Jonathan M; Wensink, Laurie J; Crawford, Neal S; Eberhardt, Angela M; Grottke, Kara L; Helmers, Richard A",,661,20

Thus, understanding its life cycle mechanistically would be important to facilitate the design of antiviral drugs. A key aspect of viral progression is the synthesis of viral proteins by the ribosome of the human host. In Coronaviruses, this process is regulated by the viral 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs), but the precise regulatory mechanism has not yet been well understood. In particular, the 5'-UTR of the viral genome is most likely involved in translation initiation of viral proteins. Here, we performed inline probing and RNase V1 probing to establish a model of the secondary structure of SARS-CoV-2 5'-UTR. We found that the 5'-UTR contains stable structures including a very stable four-way junction close to the AUG start codon. Sequence alignment analysis of SARS-CoV-2 variants 5'-UTRs revealed a highly conserved structure with few co-variations that confirmed our secondary structure model based on probing experiments.","Miao, Zhichao; Tidu, Antonin; Eriani, Gilbert; Martin, Franck",RNA Biol,661,20

The instructors and faculty at most institutions have had to adapt, invent, and implement adjustments quickly to adopt an online learning environment. This has been an extraordinarily challenging time for both students and instructors, particularly as many were not aware of the affordances and weaknesses of the online learning environment before it was uptaken. Particularly for chemistry and related disciplines, this change in delivery mode is even more disruptive in courses that have laboratory components due to loss of access to laboratories. As a teaching community, it was our responsibility to respond quickly and effectively to students' learning needs during this unprecedented global crisis. In our course, we provided succinct pre-recorded lecture-videos by topic rather than live-streaming of lectures. The recordings were made available to students a minimum of 24 h before the scheduled lecture time. Students were then provided opportunities to attend live tutorial sessions (held on Zoom and live Q&A feature on Piazza) if they had any questions that they wanted to ask the lecturer directly. We believe that the asynchronous sessions were more equitable than synchronous ones. This meant that students with difficult and challenging home/learning environments (i.e., disruptions at home, work/family schedules, poor internet, limited access to devices, etc.) were minimally disadvantaged. The approach worked well in general for teaching chemistry to pharmacy students and we believe that it can be adopted for other subjects.","Pilkington, Lisa I; Hanif, Muhammad",Biochem Mol Biol Educ,661,1

The Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, the third COVID-19 vaccine authorized for use in the United States, uses a replication-incompetent human adenoviral type 26 vector platform* (2) and is administered as a single intramuscular dose, whereas the first two authorized vaccines use an mRNA platform and require 2 doses. On February 28, 2021, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) issued interim recommendations for use of Janssen COVID-19 vaccine among persons aged &#8805;18 years (3). During April 13-23, CDC and FDA recommended a pause in use of Janssen vaccine after reports of six cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) with thrombocytopenia (platelet count <150,000/µL of blood) among Janssen vaccine recipients (4). Similar thrombotic events, primarily among women aged <60 years, have been described in Europe after receipt of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, which uses a replication-incompetent chimpanzee adenoviral vector (5-7). The U.S. CVST cases that prompted the pause in Janssen vaccination, as well as subsequently detected CVST cases, are described elsewhere (8). This report summarizes adverse events among Janssen vaccine recipients, including non-CVST cases of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), reported to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS), a passive surveillance system, and through v-safe, an active monitoring system. As of April 21, 2021, 7.98 million doses of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine had been administered. Among 13,725 VAERS reports reviewed, 97% were classified as nonserious and 3% as serious, including three reports among women of cases of thrombosis in large arteries or veins accompanied by thrombocytopenia during the second week after vaccination. These three cases and the previously detected CVST cases are consistent with 17 cases of TTS,§ a newly defined condition. Approximately 338,700 Janssen COVID-19 vaccine recipients completed at least one v-safe survey during the week after vaccination; 76% reported a systemic reaction, 61% reported a local reaction, and 34% reported a health impact.¶ Fatigue and pain were commonly reported symptoms in both VAERS and v-safe. The overall safety profile is consistent with preauthorization clinical trials data. Prompt review of U.S. vaccine safety data detected three additional cases of non-CVST TTS, in addition to the previously recognized CVST cases that initiated the pause in use of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine.

The primary objective of this scoping review is to synthesize current research of the diagnostic accuracy of history, physical examination, routine laboratory tests, real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), immunology tests, and computed tomography (CT) for the emergency department (ED) diagnosis of COVID-19. Secondary objectives included a synopsis of diagnostic biases likely with current COVID-19 research as well as corresponding implications of false-negative and false-positive results for clinicians and investigators. METHODS: A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses-Scoping Review (PRISMA-ScR)-adherent synthesis of COVID-19 diagnostic accuracy through May 5, 2020, was conducted. The search strategy was designed by a medical librarian and included studies indexed by PubMed and Embase since January 2020. RESULTS: A total of 1,907 citations were screened for relevance. Patients without COVID-19 are rarely reported, so specificity and likelihood ratios were generally unavailable. Fever is the most common finding, while hyposmia and hypogeusia appear useful to rule in COVID-19. Cough is not consistently present. Lymphopenia is the mostly commonly reported laboratory abnormality and occurs in over 50% of COVID-19 patients. rRT-PCR is currently considered the COVID-19 criterion standard for most diagnostic studies, but a single test sensitivity ranges from 60% to 78%. Multiple reasons for false-negatives rRT-PCR exist, including sample site tested and disease stage during which sample was obtained. CT may increase COVID-19 sensitivity in conjunction with rRT-PCR, but guidelines for imaging patients most likely to benefit are emerging. IgM and IgG serology levels are undetectable in the first week of COVID-19, but sensitivity (range = 82% to 100%) and specificity (range = 87% to 100%) are promising. Whether detectable COVID-19 antibodies correspond to immunity remains unanswered. Current studies do not adhere to accepted diagnostic accuracy reporting standards and likely report significantly biased results if the same tests were to be applied to general ED populations with suspected COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: With the exception of fever and disorders of smell/taste, history and physical examination findings are unhelpful to distinguish COVID-19 from other infectious conditions that mimic SARS-CoV-2 like influenza. Routine laboratory tests are also nondiagnostic, although lymphopenia is a common finding and other abnormalities may predict severe disease. Although rRT-PCR is the current criterion standard, more inclusive consensus-based criteria will likely emerge because of the high false-negative rate of PCR tests. The role of serology and CT in ED assessments remains undefined.","Carpenter, Christopher R; Mudd, Philip A; West, Colin P; Wilber, Erin; Wilber, Scott T",Acad. emerg. med,661,1

Virus-specific T cells were polyfunctional and were able to lyse target cells in vivo. Further, type I interferon pathway was proved to be critical for generating optimal antiviral T cell responses after SARS-CoV-2 infection. T cell vaccination alone partially protected SARS-CoV-2-infected mice from severe disease. In addition, the results demonstrated cross-reactive T cell responses between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, but not MERS-CoV, in mice.

It then focuses on soft law measures, the use of which became significant only in Phase II of Italy's response to COVID-19 and argues that non-binding legal instruments provided the public with instructions on gradually returning to normal life. This contribution contains case studies on the soft law measures adopted in relation to private economic enterprise and freedom of worship. Italian soft law deployed during the COVID-19 epidemic was borne out of coordination between the state and the Regions and as the result of (even informal) dialogue with the relevant stakeholders. Despite some criticism of the soft law measures used, their role in restricting constitutionally granted rights was marginal, because only hard law measures adopted nationally and locally limited personal rights and freedoms in order to contain the pandemic. ©","Aperio Bella, F.; Lauri, C.; Capra, G.",European Journal of Risk Regulation,661,20

However, quantifying this impact is difficult as meteorological conditions may mask the real effect of changes in emissions on the observed concentrations of pollutants. Based on the air quality and meteorological data at 35 sites in Beijing from 2015 to 2020, a machine learning technique was applied to decouple the impacts of meteorology and emissions on the concentrations of air pollutants. The results showed that the real (“deweathered”) concentrations of air pollutants (expect for O3) dropped significantly due to lockdown measures. Compared with the scenario without lockdowns (predicted concentrations), the observed values of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2 and CO during lockdowns decreased by 39.4%, 50.1%, 51.8%, 43.1% and 35.1%, respectively. In addition, a significant decline for NO2 and CO was found at the background sites (51% and 37.8%) rather than the transport sites (37.1% and 35.5%), which is different from the common belief. While the primary emissions reduced during the lockdown period, episodic haze events still occurred due to unfavorable meteorological conditions. Thus, developing an optimized strategy to tackle air pollution in Beijing is essential in the future. 摘要 基于2015–2020年北京35个环境空气站和20个气象站观测资料, 应用机器学习方法 (随机森林算法) 分离了气象条件和源排放对大气污染物浓度的影响.结果发现, 为应对疫情采取的隔离措施使北京2020年春节期间大气污染物浓度降低了35.1%–51.8%;其中, 背景站氮氧化物和一氧化碳浓度的降幅最大, 超过了以往报道较多的交通站点.同时, 2020年春节期间的气象条件不利于污染物扩散, 导致多次霾污染事件发生.为进一步改善北京空气质量, 未来需要优化减排策略. 关键词 机器学习;大气污染;去气象化;COVID-19;减排策略","Hu, Jiabao Pan Yuepeng He Yuexin Chi Xiyuan Zhang Qianqian Song Tao Shen Weishou",Atmospheric and Oceanic Science Letters,661,16

METHODS: Review of pertinent literature. RESULTS: There is at least 1 precedent for an antibody response against a viral pathogen that fails to provide host protection in the absence of immune-competent CD4+ T cells. PML is an infection of the CNS caused by JC virus (JCV), which commonly occurs during treatment with the therapeutic monoclonal antibody natalizumab. In this context, the humoral immune response fails to prevent JCV reactivation, and elevated anti-JCV serum indices are associated with a higher PML incidence. The more relevant immune-competent cells in host defense against JCV appear to be T cells. T cell-mediated responses are also detectable in convalescing patients with SARS-COV-2 irrespective of the humoral immune response. CONCLUSION: Based on pathogenic lessons learned from PML under natalizumab therapy, we suggest the incorporation of functional assays that determine neutralizing properties of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. In addition, we outline the potential role of T-cell detection assays in determining herd immunity in a given population or in studying therapeutic responses to vaccines.","Manouchehri, Navid; Steinman, Lawrence; Stuve, Olaf",,661,24

Microencapsulation of IGF-1 could potentially improve results. We aimed to test the effect of an intracoronary (IC) infusion of microencapsulated IGF-1 in a swine acute MI model. For that purpose IC injection of a 10 ml solution of 5 × 106 IGF-1 loaded microspheres (MSPs) (n = 8, IGF-1 MSPs), 5 × 106 unloaded MSPs (n = 9; MSPs) or saline (n = 7; CON) was performed 48 hours post-MI. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), indexed ventricular volumes and infarct size (IS) were determined by cardiac magnetic resonance at pre-injection and 10 weeks. Animals were euthanized at 10 weeks, and myocardial fibrosis and vascular density were analysed. End-study LVEF was significantly greater in IGF-1 MSPs compared to MSPs and CON, while ventricular volumes exhibited no significant differences between groups. IS decreased over time in all groups. Collagen volume fraction on the infarct area was significantly reduced in IGF-1 MSPs compared to CON and MSPs. Vascular density analysis of infarct and border zones showed no significant differences between groups. In conclusion, the IC injection of 5 × 106 IGF-1 loaded MSPs in a porcine acute MI model successfully improves cardiac function and limits myocardial fibrosis, which could be clinically relevant.","Báez-Díaz, Claudia; Blanco-Blázquez, Virginia; Sánchez-Margallo, Francisco-Miguel; Bayes-Genis, Antoni; González, Irene; Abad, Ana; Steendam, Rob; Franssen, Okke; Palacios, Itziar; Sánchez, Belén; Gálvez-Montón, Carolina; Crisóstomo, Verónica",Sci Rep,661,1

While genetically distinct, SARS-CoV-1, the aetiological agent responsible for an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002-2003, utilises the same host cell receptor as SARS-CoV-2 for entry: angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Parts of the SARS-CoV-1 spike glycoprotein (S protein), which interacts with ACE2, appear conserved in SARS-CoV-2.AimThe cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) previously generated against the S protein of SARS-CoV-1 was assessed.MethodsThe SARS-CoV-2 S protein sequence was aligned to those of SARS-CoV-1, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and common-cold coronaviruses. Abilities of mAbs generated against SARS-CoV-1 S protein to bind SARS-CoV-2 or its S protein were tested with SARS-CoV-2 infected cells as well as cells expressing either the full length protein or a fragment of its S2 subunit. Quantitative ELISA was also performed to compare binding of mAbs to recombinant S protein.ResultsAn immunogenic domain in the S2 subunit of SARS-CoV-1 S protein is highly conserved in SARS-CoV-2 but not in MERS and human common-cold coronaviruses. Four murine mAbs raised against this immunogenic fragment could recognise SARS-CoV-2 S protein expressed in mammalian cell lines. In particular, mAb 1A9 was demonstrated to detect S protein in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and is suitable for use in a sandwich ELISA format.ConclusionThe cross-reactive mAbs may serve as useful tools for SARS-CoV-2 research and for the development of diagnostic assays for COVID-19.","Zheng, Zhiqiang; Monteil, Vanessa Marthe; Maurer-Stroh, Sebastian; Yew, Chow Wenn; Leong, Carol; Mohd-Ismail, Nur Khairiah; Cheyyatraivendran Arularasu, Suganya; Chow, Vincent Tak Kwong; Lin, Raymond Tzer Pin; Mirazimi, Ali; Hong, Wanjin; Tan, Yee-Joo",Euro surveill,661,20

Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and chest computed tomography (CT) imaging both play an important role in COVID-19 diagnosis. Chest CT imaging offers the benefits of quick reporting, a low cost, and high sensitivity for the detection of pulmonary infection. Recently, deep-learning-based computer vision methods have demonstrated great promise for use in medical imaging applications, including X-rays, magnetic resonance imaging, and CT imaging. However, training a deep-learning model requires large volumes of data, and medical staff faces a high risk when collecting COVID-19 CT data due to the high infectivity of the disease. Another issue is the lack of experts available for data labeling. In order to meet the data requirements for COVID-19 CT imaging, we propose a CT image synthesis approach based on a conditional generative adversarial network that can effectively generate high-quality and realistic COVID-19 CT images for use in deep-learning-based medical imaging tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art image synthesis methods with the generated COVID-19 CT images and indicates promising for various machine learning applications including semantic segmentation and classification.","Jiang, Yifan; Chen, Han; Loew, Murray; Ko, Hanseok",,661,1

There is an urgent need to understand this new virus and develop prophylactic and therapeutic drugs. Since drug development is an expensive, intense and time-consuming path, timely repurposing of the existing drugs is often explored wherein the research avenues including genomics, bioinformatics, molecular modeling approaches offer valuable strengths. Here, we have examined the binding potential of Withaferin-A (Wi-A), Withanone (Wi-N) (active withanolides of Ashwagandha) and Caffeic Acid Phenethyl Ester (CAPE, bioactive ingredient of propolis) to a highly conserved protein, Mpro of SARS-CoV-2. We found that Wi-N and CAPE, but not Wi-A, bind to the substrate-binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with efficacy and binding energies equivalent to an already claimed N3 protease inhibitor. Similar to N3 inhibitor, Wi-N and CAPE were interacting with the highly conserved residues of the proteases of coronaviruses. The binding stability of these molecules was further analyzed using molecular dynamics simulations. The binding free energies calculated using MM/GBSA for N3 inhibitor, CAPE and Wi-N were also comparable. Data presented here predicted that these natural compounds may possess the potential to inhibit the functional activity of SARS-CoV-2 protease (an essential protein for virus survival), and hence (i) may connect to save time and cost required for designing/development, and initial screening for anti-COVID drugs, (ii) may offer some therapeutic value for the management of novel fatal coronavirus disease, (iii) warrants prioritized further validation in the laboratory and clinical tests.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Current evidence suggests the association of COVID-19 infection in pregnancy with both severe maternal morbidity requiring intensive care and perinatal complications (preterm birth with consequent neonatal morbidity and even perinatal death). Most of the reported cases focused specifically on the maternal outcomes and possible vertical transmission, but less attention has been paid to fetus as a patient in such pregnancies. The use of antenatal steroids and fetal neuroprotection with magnesium sulfate is clearly underreported. Several recently issued guidelines suggest lowering the upper gestational age for antenatal steroid administration and also advocate extreme caution or even restraining from the use of magnesium sulfate. Also, the rate of cesarean deliveries among COVID-19 women is unacceptably high. Here we provide arguments for NOT changing the existing guidelines and caution against cesarean delivery that was the prevalent delivery mode in the reported cases and case series.","Stefanovic, Vedran",J Perinat Med,661,24

Aim: to spot the light on long-term symptoms in healthcare staff who are the first defence line in this pandemic and whose medical and psychological sufferings are underrepresented in studies. Methods: 120 male and female participants working in Ain-Shams University and Ministry of health and population hospitals who had been infected with COVID-19 virus at least 3 months ago were recruited. Presenting symptoms, staging, medications, symptoms 1 month and more than 3 months after infection were recorded. Results: The study participants aged between 23 and 62 years. fever was the most common presentation 57.5% followed by body aches in 44.2% and then anosmia in 41.7% of participants. Cough, dyspnea, fatigue and diarrhea were present in 37.5%, 33.3%, 35% and 19.2% respectively. Facial palsy and transient ischemic attack were presented each in one participant. Five participants experienced myocardial and pulmonary infarctions. Still 26.7% and 33.3% had dyspnea and fatigue after 3 months, 3 participants received antidepressants, 4 had memory problems. Parosmia, hair loss, oral ulcers and syncopal attacks emerged months after recovery. Odds ratio for symptoms after 3 months was 2.4 higher in participants aged ≥ 35 years. Conclusion: COVID-19 infection is unique in presentation and long-term symptoms which needs further large number of studies. Even young people and those with mild disease experience long term problems.","Tawfik, Heba Mohamed Shaaban Hassan Mohamed Tawfik Ahmed Mohamed",Electronic Journal of General Medicine,661,19

Towards the end of 2020, several COVID-19 vaccine candidates with relatively high efficacy have been reported in the final phase of clinical trials. Vaccines have been considered as critical tools for opening up social and economic activities, thereby lessening the impact of this disease on the society. This paper presents a simulation of COVID-19 spread using modified Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model under vaccine intervention in several localities of Malaysia, i.e. those cities or states with high relatively COVID-19 cases such as Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Sabah, and Sarawak. The results show that at different vaccine efficacy levels (0.75, 0.85, and 0.95), the curves of active infection vary slightly, indicating that vaccines with efficacy above 0.75 would produce the herd immunity required to level the curves. In addition, disparity is significant between implementing or not implementing a vaccination program. Simulation results also show that lowering the reproduction number, R0 is necessary to keep the infection curve flat despite vaccination. This is due to the assumption that vaccination is mostly carried out gradually at the assumed fixed rate. The statement is based on our simulation results with two values of R0: 1.1 and 1.2, indicative of reduction of R0 by social distancing. The lower R0 shows a smaller peak amplitude about half the value simulated with R0=1.2. In conclusion, the simulation model suggests a two-pronged strategy to combat the COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia: vaccination and compliance with standard operating procedure issued by the World Health Organization (e.g. social distancing).","Wong, W.

In this study, the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of a clinically recovered (CR) cohort were comparatively analyzed with those of an age- and sex-matched healthy donor cohort. We found that CD8+ T cells in the CR cohort had higher numbers of effector T cells and effector memory T cells but lower Tc1 (IFN-Î³+), Tc2 (IL-4+), and Tc17 (IL-17A+) cell frequencies. The CD4+ T cells of the CR cohort were decreased in frequency, especially the central memory T cell subset. Moreover, CD4+ T cells in the CR cohort showed lower programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) expression and had lower frequencies of Th1 (IFN-Î³+), Th2 (IL-4+), Th17 (IL-17A+), and circulating follicular helper T (CXCR5+PD-1+) cells. Accordingly, the proportion of isotype-switched memory B cells (IgM-CD20hi) among B cells in the CR cohort showed a significantly lower proportion, although the level of the activation marker CD71 was elevated. For CD3-HLA-DR- lymphocytes in the CR cohort, in addition to lower levels of IFN-Î³, granzyme B and T-bet, the correlation between T-bet and IFN-Î³ was not observed. Additionally, by taking into account the number of days after discharge, all the phenotypes associated with reduced function did not show a tendency toward recovery within 4â11 weeks. The remarkable phenotypic alterations in lymphocytes in the CR cohort suggest that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection profoundly affects lymphocytes and potentially results in dysfunction even after clinical recovery.","Yang, Jingyi; Zhong, Maohua; Zhang, Ejuan; Hong, Ke; Yang, Qingyu; Zhou, Dihan; Xia, Jianbo; Chen, Yao-Qing; Sun, Mingbo; Zhao, Bali; Xiang, Jie; Liu, Ying; Han, Yang; Xu, Mengxin; Zhou, Xi; Huang, Chaolin; Shang, You; Yan, Huimin",J Mol Cell Biol,661,17
463418,463418,463418,Understanding Coronanomics: the Economic Implications of the Covid-19 Pandemic,18.134064,4.043827,2021,"BACKGROUND: Regional monitoring of the proportion of the population who have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 is important to guide local management of the epidemic, but is difficult in the absence of regular nationwide serosurveys. We aimed to estimate in near real time the proportion of adults who have been infected by SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: In this modelling study, we developed a method to reconstruct the proportion of adults who have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 and the proportion of infections being detected, using the joint analysis of age-stratified seroprevalence, hospitalisation, and case data, with deconvolution methods. We developed our method on a dataset consisting of seroprevalence estimates from 9782 participants (aged &#8805;20 years) in the two worst affected regions of France in May, 2020, and applied our approach to the 13 French metropolitan regions over the period March, 2020, to January, 2021. We validated our method externally using data from a national seroprevalence study done between May and June, 2020. FINDINGS: We estimate that 5·7% (95% CI 5·1-6·4) of adults in metropolitan France had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 by May 11, 2020. This proportion remained stable until August, 2020, and increased to 14·9% (13·2-16·9) by Jan 15, 2021. With 26·5% (23·4-29·8) of adult residents having been infected in Île-de-France (Paris region) compared with 5·1% (4·5-5·8) in Brittany by January, 2021, regional variations remained large (coefficient of variation [CV] 0·50) although less so than in May, 2020 (CV 0·74). The proportion infected was twice as high (20·4%, 15·6-26·3) in 20-49-year-olds than in individuals aged 50 years or older (9·7%, 6·9-14·1). 40·2% (34·3-46·3) of infections in adults were detected in June to August, 2020, compared with 49·3% (42·9-55·9) in November, 2020, to January, 2021. Our regional estimates of seroprevalence were strongly correlated with the external validation dataset (coefficient of correlation 0·89). INTERPRETATION: Our simple approach to estimate the proportion of adults that have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 can help to characterise the burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection, epidemic dynamics, and the performance of surveillance in different regions.

The COVID-19 outbreak brought additional concerns and uncertainties once educational systems implemented distance learning schemes for public health management. Nevertheless, higher educational organizations preferred to implement hybrid approaches for student engagement motivation and high dropout rate avoidance. In Romania, such an educational system has been applied with caution. Since the pandemic needs to be understood as an opportunity for adaptation and education improvements, the purpose of the present paper is to uncover lessons learned and to develop a systematized model based on students' perception regarding face-to-face, online and hybrid systems. For this reason, a grounded theory approach has been preferred. Thus, 149 Romanian students enrolled in the first year in engineering specialities with ages between 18-26 years both male (50.3%) and female (49.7%) have answered the research questions in an online environment due to pandemic restrictions. Based on the online asynchronous student interviews, 220 codes and a further 13 categories have been developed. After a pertinent analysis of the relationships between categories and relevant literature sorting, a theoretical model for the Romanian higher educational current pandemic situation has been proposed. The main face-to-face and online education characteristics are outlined, the hybrid approach becoming a bridge between the two systems. Management implications are outlined together with further research directions.","Potra, Sabina; Pugna, Adrian; Pop, Madalin-Dorin; Negrea, Romeo; Dungan, Luisa",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),661,2

As all the proposed drugs proved to be unstable, inducing side effects, the need to develop a vaccine crystallized in a short time. As a result, we searched the databases for articles in which the authors reported the efficacy and safety of the use of several vaccines vaccines by sex, age group, and frequency of adverse reactions. We identified a total of 19 relevant articles that were discussed throughout this manuscript. We concluded that from all eleven vaccines, three had an efficacy >90% (Pfizer-BioNTech (~95%), Moderna (~94%), and Sputnik V (~92%)) except for Oxford-AstraZeneca (~81%). However, Moderna, Sputnik V, and Oxford-AstraZeneca also alleviate severe adverse reactions, whereas in Pfizer-BioNTech this was not revealed. The remaining five (Convidicea (AD5-nCOV); Johnson & Johnson (Ad26.COV2.S); Sinopharm (BBIBP-CorV); Covaxin (BBV152), and Sinovac (CoronaVac)) were discussed based on their immunogenicity, and safety reported by the recipients since only phases 1 and 2 were conducted without clear evidence published regarding their efficacy. CoviVac and EpiVacCorona have just been approved, which is why no published article could be found. All adverse events reported following the administration of one of the four vaccines ranged from mild to moderate; limited exceptions in which the patients either developed severe forms or died, because most effects were dose-dependent. It can be concluded that aforementioned vaccines are efficient and safe, regardless of age and sex, being well-tolerated by the recipients.","Doroftei, Bogdan; Ciobica, Alin; Ilie, Ovidiu-Dumitru; Maftei, Radu; Ilea, Ciprian",Diagnostics (Basel),661,20

A concern was raised regarding the safety of ibuprofen use because of its role in increasing ACE2 levels within the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone system. ACE2 is the coreceptor for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cells, and so, a potential increased risk of contracting COVID-19 disease and/or worsening of COVID-19 infection was feared with ibuprofen use.

How did a liar, which is traditionally deemed something worse than a hypocrite, manage to do this? This article offers an answer. It does so by uncovering a peculiar mechanism, a Trumpian mechanism, at the heart of Trump’s relations with his critics. The mechanism explains how Trump benefited from wrong-footing his critics and is thus essential for understanding Trump’s success. The article offers a few key examples of this mechanism working against Trump’s political opponents, e.g., Trump’s (first) impeachment. It then shows how the mechanism also worked against Trump in regard to his handling of Covid-19. Ultimately, the mechanism helps explain both the outcome of the 2016 and the 2020 elections. The article concludes by stressing the importance of using this mechanism to better understand the Trump phenomenon. It claims that using the mechanism as a guide to understand Trump can prevent empowering the very object we, as critics, often aim to disempower.","Peixoto, Emmett",CLCWeb,661,1

Consequently, the university classes are being held over the Internet, and students attend these classes from their homes. While the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to be prolonged, the online-centric lifestyle has raised concerns about secondary health issues caused by reduced physical activity (PA). However, the actual status of PA among university students has not yet been examined in Japan. Hence, in this study, we collected daily PA data (including the data corresponding to the number of steps taken and the data associated with six types of activities) by employing smartphones and thereby analyzed the changes in the PA of university students. The PA data were collected over a period of ten weeks from 305 first-year university students who were attending a mandatory class of physical education at the university. The obtained results indicate that compared to the average number of steps taken before the COVID-19 pandemic (6474.87 steps), the average number of steps taken after the COVID-19 pandemic (3522.5 steps) has decreased by 45.6%. Furthermore, the decrease in commuting time (7 AM to 10 AM), classroom time, and extracurricular activity time (11 AM to 12 AM) has led to a decrease in PA on weekdays owing to reduced unplanned exercise opportunities and has caused an increase in the duration of being in the stationary state in the course of daily life.","Nishiyama, Yuuki; Kakino, Yuui; Naka, Enishi; Noda, Yuka; Hashiba, Satsuki; Yamada, Yusuke; Sasaki, Wataru; Okoshi, Tadashi; Nakazawa, Jin; Mori, Masaki; Mizutori, Hisashi; Shiota, Kotomi; Nagano, Tomohisa; Tokairin, Yuko; Kato, Takaaki",,661,10

Loss of Sia production can cause the developmental of defects and lethality in most animals; hence, animal cells are less prone to evolution of resistance to interactions by rapidly evolved Sia-binding viruses. Obligative intracellular viruses mostly have rapid evolution that allows escape from host immunity, leading to an epidemic variant, and that allows emergence of a novel strain, occasionally leading to pandemics that cause health-social-economic problems. Recently, much attention has been given to the mutual recognition systems via sialosugar chains between viruses and their host cells and there has been rapid growth of the research field ""sialoglycovirology."" In this chapter, the structural diversity of sialoglycoconjugates is overviewed, and enveloped and non-enveloped viruses that bind to Sia are reviewed. Also, interactions of viral lectins-host Sia receptors, which determine viral transmission, host range, and pathogenesis, are presented. The future direction of new therapeutic routes targeting viral lectins, development of easy-to-use detection methods for diagnosis and monitoring changes in virus binding specificity, and challenges in the development of suitable viruses to use in virus-based therapies for genetic disorders and cancer are discussed.","Sriwilaijaroen, Nongluk; Suzuki, Yasuo",Methods Mol Biol,661,16

We use the framework of adaptive networks, moment-closure, and ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to introduce several novel models based upon susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) dynamics. First, we compare computationally expensive, adaptive network simulations with their corresponding computationally highly efficient ODE equivalents and find excellent agreement. Second, we discover that there exists a relatively simple critical curve in parameter space for the epidemic threshold, which strongly suggests that there is a mutual compensation effect between the two mitigation strategies: as long as social distancing and quarantine measures are both sufficiently strong, large outbreaks are prevented. Third, we study the total number of infected and the maximum peak during large outbreaks using a combination of analytical estimates and numerical simulations. Also for large outbreaks we find a similar compensation effect as for the epidemic threshold. This suggests that if there is little incentive for social distancing within a population, drastic quarantining is required, and vice versa. Both pure scenarios are unrealistic in practice. Our models show that only a combination of measures is likely to succeed to control epidemic spreading. Fourth, we analytically compute an upper bound for the total number of infected on adaptive networks, using integral estimates in combination with the moment-closure approximation on the level of an observable. This is a methodological innovation. Our method allows us to elegantly and quickly check and cross-validate various conjectures about the relevance of different network control measures.","Horstmeyer, Leonhard; Kuehn, Christian; Thurner, Stefan",,661,16

However, when MCMC is used for evolutionary parameter learning, convergence requires long runs with inefficient exploration of the state space. We introduce Variational Combinatorial Sequential Monte Carlo (VCSMC), a powerful framework that establishes variational sequential search to learn distributions over intricate combinatorial structures. We then develop nested CSMC, an efficient proposal distribution for CSMC and prove that nested CSMC is an exact approximation to the (intractable) locally optimal proposal. We use nested CSMC to define a second objective, VNCSMC which yields tighter lower bounds than VCSMC. We show that VCSMC and VNCSMC are computationally efficient and explore higher probability spaces than existing methods on a range of tasks.","Moretti, Antonio Khalil; Zhang, Liyi; Naesseth, Christian A.; Venner, Hadiah; Blei, David; Pe'er, Itsik",,661,12

Despite major progress, the selectivity and stability of such catalysts still need to be substantially improved. Here we demonstrate that controlling the surface oxidation of Cu nanowires (CuNWs) can greatly improve their C2+ selectivity and stability. Specifically, we achieve a faradaic efficiency as high as 57.7 and 52.0% for ethylene when the CuNWs are oxidized by the O2 from air and aqueous H2O2, respectively, and both of them show hydrogen selectivity below 12%. The high yields of C2+ products can be mainly attributed to the increase in surface roughness and the generation of defects and cavities during the electrochemical reduction of oxide layer. Our results also indicate that the formation of a relatively thick, smooth oxide sheath can improve the catalytic stability by mitigating the fragmentation issue.","Lyu, Zhiheng; Zhu, Shangqian; Xie, Minghao; Zhang, Yu; Chen, Zitao; Chen, Ruhui; Tian, Mengkun; Chi, Miaofang; Shao, Minhua; Xia, Younan",Angew. chem; int. ed. engl,661,20

While early studies have uncovered some evidence of racial and ethnic differences in mask-wearing behavior, critical gaps remain. We begin to address these gaps by (1) more comprehensively investigating the role of race and ethnicity on mask wearing during the COVID-19 pandemic and (2) examining whether gender intersects with race and ethnicity to differently influence mask-wearing patterns. METHODS: Data were drawn from the COVID-19 Impact Survey, a cross-sectional, nationally representative survey of adults living in the U.S. Data were pooled from three time points that ranged from late April 2020 to early June 2020. The final analytic sample consisted of 4688 non-institutionalized adults living in the U.S. A series of logistic regression models with robust standard errors were used to estimate differences in mask-wearing patterns. RESULTS: Compared with White respondents, results revealed Black, Latina/o, and Asian respondents were more likely to report wearing a mask in response to the coronavirus. Moreover, results show White men were least likely to wear a mask from late April 2020 to early June 2020. CONCLUSION: Overall, findings demonstrate mask-wearing patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic are differently shaped by racial and ethnic background and gender. Findings from this study can inform targeted strategies designed to increase mask-wearing adherence among U.S. adults.","Hearne, Brittany N; Niño, Michael D",J. racial ethnic health disparities (Internet),661,12

METHODS: A survey of patients with ongoing IVIs for retinal diseases was carried out between April 23rd and May 12th, 2020. We designed a questionnaire to assess patient satisfaction concerning: personal protective equipment (PPE), social distancing, the perceived quality of care, and the total time spent in the department, using a Likert scale. We also collected the time spent per patients in the outpatient IVI clinic. RESULTS: A hundred and twenty-seven eyes of 108 patients were included. The mean time spent in the IVI outpatient clinic was 31.87 +/- 16.61 min. In our survey, 99.1% of the patients were satisfied (highly satisfied or satisfied) with the new type of care provided, 89.8% with the duration of care, and 93.5% with the PPE. Satisfaction was associated with total time spent in hospital (p = 0.005), with dissatisfied patients spending about 50% more time in the hospital than satisfied patients (43.91 min vs 30.50 min).

We investigated changes in humor and sarcasm use during the COVID-19 pandemic in participants with varying anxiety and depression symptom severity, and in those with versus without psychiatric disorders. METHODS: Online data was collected from N = 661 Canadian adults during the height of COVID-19-related restrictions. Depression and anxiety symptom severity were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale. Participants were queried on current presence/absence of a psychiatric disorder, and on changes in humor and sarcasm use during compared to before the pandemic. RESULTS: Participants with any vs. no depression symptoms reported more sarcasm and humor use during the pandemic. Respondents with mild and severe vs. no anxiety symptoms reported using more sarcasm. However, those with any vs. no anxiety symptoms used less humor during the pandemic. Finally, less humor use was noted in those without vs. with a psychiatric disorder. LIMITATIONS: The use of self-report measures and a sample that may limit generalizability. CONCLUSIONS: Adults with depression symptoms used more humor and sarcasm as a potential coping strategy during COVID-19. While individuals with anxiety symptoms used more sarcasm, this was not true of humor, suggesting their decreased reliance on levity during a crisis. Humor use was greater in those with psychiatric disorders, perhaps due to self-preservation mechanisms during times of distress.

Yet, the physics of such interactions is currently poorly understood. For instance, there are longstanding experimental observations suggesting that the presence of air-water interfaces can generically inactivate and kill viruses, yet the mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unknown. Here we use theory and simulations to show that electrostatics provides one such mechanism, and that this is very general. Thus, we predict that the free energy of an RNA virus should increase by several thousands of $k_BT$ as the virion breaches an air-water interface. We also show that the fate of a virus approaching a generic liquid-liquid interface depends strongly on the detailed balance between interfacial and electrostatic forces, which can be tuned, for instance, by choosing different media to contact a virus-laden respiratory droplet. We propose that these results can be used to design effective strategies for surface disinfection. Intriguingly, tunability requires electrostatic and interfacial forces to scale similarly with viral size, which naturally occurs when charges are arranged in a double-shell distribution as in RNA viruses like influenza and all coronaviruses.","Brackley, C.

This study aimed to identify risk factors associated with mortality and outcomes among hospitalized Mexican patients with COVID-19. Methods: We prospectively assessed patients admitted to a COVID-19 reference center in the southeast of Mexico between March 28th and June 30th, 2020. Mortality was defined as survivor or non-survivor and univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed to explore the association of clinical characteristics and laboratory parameters with mortality. Results: We included 200 patients with a mean age of 55 years, 69% were men, 72% had at least one chronic comorbidity. Eighty-six patients required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) with an overall mortality rate of 82.5%. Only 51% of patients with IMV had Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, with a survival rate of 27.3%, but only 7.2% for Non-ICU admission (p<0.014).

There has been extensive research performed on SARS; however, the understanding of the pathophysiological impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still limited. METHODS: This review drew upon the lessons learnt from SARS, in terms of epidemiology, clinical characteristics and pathogenesis, to further understand the features of COVID-19. RESULTS: By comparing these two diseases, it found that COVID-19 has quicker and wider transmission, obvious family agglomeration, and higher morbidity and mortality. Newborns, asymptomatic children and normal chest imaging cases emerged in COVID-19 literature. Children starting with gastrointestinal symptoms may progress to severe conditions and newborns whose mothers are infected with COVID-19 could have severe complications. The laboratory test data showed that the percentage of neutrophils and the level of LDH is higher, and the number of CD4+ and CD8+T-cells is decreased in children's COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSION: Based on these early observations, as pediatricians, this review put forward some thoughts on children's COVID-19 and gave some recommendations to contain the disease.","Zhou, Meng-Yao; Xie, Xiao-Li; Peng, Yong-Gang; Wu, Meng-Jun; Deng, Xiao-Zhi; Wu, Ying; Xiong, Li-Jing; Shang, Li-Hong",Int J Infect Dis,661,16

METHODS: We describe a multidisciplinary vascular access team's development to improve frontline providers' workflow by placing central venous and arterial catheters. Herein we describe the development, organization, and processes resulting in the rapid formation and deployment of this team, reporting on notable clinical issues encountered, which might serve as a basis for future quality improvement and investigation. We describe a retrospective, single-center descriptive study in a large, quaternary academic medical center in a major city. The COVID-19 vascular access team included physicians with specialized experience in placing invasive catheters and whose usual clinical schedule had been lessened through deferment of elective cases. The target population included patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 in the medical ICU (MICU) needing invasive catheter placement. The line team placed all invasive catheters on patients in the MICU with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Primary data collected were the number and type of catheters placed, time of team member exposure to potentially infected patients, and any complications over the first three weeks. Secondary outcomes pertained to workflow enhancement and quality improvement. 145 invasive catheters were placed on 67 patients. Of these 67 patients, 90% received arterial catheters, 64% central venous catheters, and 25% hemodialysis catheters. None of the central venous catheterizations or hemodialysis catheters were associated with early complications. Arterial line malfunction due to thrombosis was the most frequent complication. Division of labor through specialized expert procedural teams is feasible during a pandemic and offloads frontline providers while potentially conferring safety benefits.","Nawathe, Pooja; Wong, Robert; Pollock, Gabriel; Green, Jack; Kissen, Michael; Ng, Phillip; Cohen, Samuel; Barron, Joel; Robert, Stephen; Slingwine, Christy; Frank, Paul; Navab, Kaveh; Kim, Doran; Yang, Michael; Gouvea, Tyler; Johnson, Calvin; Pedraza, Isabel; Zahn, Evan",J Vasc Access,661,25

Effective infection prevention and control (IPC) in HHC is essential to keeping both healthcare workers and patients safe, especially in the event of an emerging infectious disease outbreak. Prior to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, we explored successes and challenges with IPC from the perspectives of HHC staff. DESIGN: Qualitative descriptive study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: From May to November 2018, we conducted in-depth telephone interviews with 41 staff from 13 agencies across the nation. METHODS: Transcripts were coded by a multidisciplinary coding team, and several primary and subcategories were identified using directed content analysis. RESULTS: Four primary categories were generated including (1) uniqueness of HHC; (2) IPC as a priority; (3) importance of education; and (4) keys to success and innovation. Participants perceived that IPC plays a big part in patient safety and reducing rehospitalizations, and protection of patients and staff was a major motivator for compliance with IPC. The identified challenges included the unpredictability of the home environment, patient/family dynamics, the intermittent nature of HHC, and staffing issues. Education was seen as a tool to improve staff, patient, caregiver and families' compliance with IPC. Keys to success and innovation included a leadership focus on quality, using agency infection data to improve quality, and a coordinated approach to patient care. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: This qualitative work identified barriers to effective IPC in HHC, as well as important facilitators that HHC agencies can use to implement policies and procedures to improve patient care and keep staff safe. Leadership prioritization of IPC is key to implementing appropriate IPC policies and may be especially important in midst of a crisis such as coronavirus disease 2019.","Pogorzelska-Maziarz, Monika; Chastain, Ashley M; Mangal, Sabrina; Stone, Patricia W; Shang, Jingjing",J Am Med Dir Assoc,661,5

There are no approved drugs or vaccines yet available against SARS-CoV-2. Material and methods: State-of-the-art tools based on in-silico methods are a cost-effective initial approach for identifying appropriate ligands against SARS-CoV-2. The present study developed the 3D structure of the envelope and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, and molecular docking analysis was done against various ligands. Results: The highest log octanol/water partition coefficient, high number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, lowest non-bonded interaction energy between the receptor and the ligand, and high binding affinity were considered for the best ligand for the envelope (mycophenolic acid: log P = 3.00; ΔG = -10.2567 kcal/mol; pKi = 7.713 μM) and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (1-[(2,4-dichlorophenyl)methyl]pyrazole-3,5-dicarboxylic acid: log P = 2.901; ΔG = -12.2112 kcal/mol; pKi = 7.885 μM) of SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions: The study identifies the most potent compounds against the SARS-CoV-2 envelope and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein through state-of-the-art tools based on an in-silico approach.

In particular, the service industry needs to allocate more manpower, and it will be important for robots to support people. This study focuses on using a humanoid robot as a social service robot to convey information in a shopping mall, and the robot's behavioral concepts were analyzed. In order to convey the information, two processes must occur. Pedestrians must stop in front of the robot, and the robot must continue the engagement with them. For the purpose of this study, three types of autonomous behavioral concepts of the robot for the general use were analyzed and compared in these processes in the experiment: active, passive-negative, and passive-positive concepts. After interactions were attempted with 65,000+ pedestrians, this study revealed that the passive-negative concept can make pedestrians stop more and stay longer. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the robot in a real environment, the comparative results between three behaviors and human advertisers revealed that (1) the results of the active and passive-positive concepts of the robot are comparable to those of the humans, and (2) the performance of the passive-negative concept is higher than that of all participants. These findings demonstrate that the performance of robots is comparable to that of humans in providing information tasks in a limited environment; therefore, it is expected that service robots as a labor support technology will be able to perform well in the real world.","Okafuji, Yuki; Ozaki, Yasunori; Baba, Jun; Nakanishi, Junya; Ogawa, Kohei; Yoshikawa, Yuichiro; Ishiguro, Hiroshi",,661,10

Our objective was to estimate the prevalence and correlates of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). METHODS: We employed a population-based probability survey of adults with COVID-19 in Michigan. Living non-institutionalized adults aged 18+ in the Michigan Disease Surveillance System with COVID-19 onset through mid-April 2020 were eligible for selection (n=28,000). Among 2,000 selected, 629 completed the survey between June - December 2020. We estimated PASC prevalence, defined as persistent symptoms 30+ (30-day COVID-19) or 60+ days (60-day COVID-19) post COVID-19 onset, overall and by sociodemographic and clinical factors, including self-reported symptom severity and hospitalization status. We used modified Poisson regression to produce adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) for potential risk factors. RESULTS: The analytic sample (n=593) was predominantly female (56.1%), aged 45 and older (68.2%), and Non-Hispanic White (46.3%) or Black (34.8%). 30- and 60-day COVID-19 were highly prevalent (52.5% and 35.0%), even among non-hospitalized respondents (43.7% and 26.9%) and respondents reporting mild symptoms (29.2% and 24.5%). Respondents reporting very severe (vs. mild) symptoms had 2.25 times higher prevalence of 30-day COVID-19 ([aPR] 2.25, 95% CI 1.46-3.46) and 1.71 times higher prevalence of 60-day COVID-19 (aPR 1.71, 95% 1.02-2.88). Hospitalized (vs. non-hospitalized) respondents had about 40% higher prevalence of both 30-day (aPR 1.37, 95% CI 1.12-1.69) and 60-day COVID-19 (aPR 1.40, 95% CI 1.02-1.93).

These disorders are characterized by deficits in fear extinction and dysfunction in underlying neural circuitry. Given the strong and pervasive link between childhood trauma and the development of psychopathology, fear extinction may be a key mechanism. The present study tests the impact of childhood trauma exposure on fear extinction and underlying neural circuitry. Children (N = 44, 45% trauma-exposed; 6-11 yrs) completed a novel two-day virtual reality fear extinction experiment. On day one, participants underwent fear conditioning and extinction. Twenty-four hours later, participants completed a test of extinction recall during fMRI. Conditioned fear was measured throughout the experiment using skin conductance and fear-related behavior, and activation in fear-related brain regions was estimated during recall. There were no group differences in conditioned fear during fear conditioning or extinction learning. During extinction recall, however, trauma-exposed children kept more distance from both the previously extinguished and the safety cue, suggesting poor differentiation between threat and safety cues. Trauma-exposed youth also failed to approach the previously extinguished cue over the course of extinction recall. The effects on fear-related behavior during extinction recall were accompanied by higher activation to the previously extinguished cue in fear-relevant brain regions, including the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and anterior insula, in trauma-exposed relative to control children. Alterations in fear-related brain regions and fear-related behavior may be a core mechanism through which childhood trauma confers heightened vulnerability to psychopathology.","Marusak, Hilary A; Hehr, Aneesh; Bhogal, Amanpreet; Peters, Craig; Iadipaolo, Allesandra; Rabinak, Christine A",Behav Brain Res,661,16

The same lessons can apply for plant viruses. There are plant viruses that have severely disrupted crop production in multiple countries, as recently seen with maize lethal necrosis disease in eastern and southern Africa. High-throughput sequencing (HTS) is needed to detect new viral threats. Equally important is building local capacity to develop the tools required for rapid diagnosis of plant viruses. Most plant viruses are insect-vectored, hence, biological insights on virus transmission are vital in modelling disease spread. Research in Africa in these three areas is in its infancy and disjointed. Despite intense interest, uptake of HTS by African researchers is hampered by infrastructural gaps. The use of whole-genome information to develop field-deployable diagnostics on the continent is virtually inexistent. There is fledgling research into plant-virus-vector interactions to inform modelling of viral transmission. The gains so far have been modest but encouraging, and therefore must be consolidated. For this, I propose the creation of a new Research Centre for Africa.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional epidemiological study using a model of the city of Tyumen was conducted on a representative sample of the population among males of mature age (4564 years). Based on standard epidemiological methods, IHD was established according to strict epidemiological criteria definite IHD. The study of the factors of psycho-emotional stress (depression, hostility, life exhaustion) was carried out according to the algorithms of the World Health Organization program MONICA-psychosocial. When calculating the odds ratio for the development of IHD, a low level of psycho-emotional stress factors was regarded as the absence of a sign, a combination of medium and high levels as a presence. RESULTS: The prevalence of ischemic heart disease in the open population (on the model of Tyumen) according to strict epidemiological criteria in men aged 4554 years was 8.2%, at the age of 5564 years 19.2%, a predominance of painless form of ischemic heart disease was revealed. According to the levels of factors of psychoemotional stress in mature men, mainly the average level of depression and life exhaustion, a high level of hostility were established. In men of an open population (on the model of Tyumen), depending on the psychoemotional stress, a high risk of developing a certain coronary heart disease was established in the age categories 4554 and 5564 years old in the presence of depression, at the age of 5564 years in the presence of hostility or life exhaustion. CONCLUSION: Consequently, the data obtained indicate the importance of further studying the factors of psychoemotional stress in men of mature age in Siberian populations, their relationships with conventional risk factors for coronary artery disease, as well as the advisability of preventive measures aimed at weakening the influence of not only conventional risk factors, but also factors of psycho-emotional stress. among the Russian population.","Akimova, E V; Akimov, M Y; Kayumova, M M; Gafarov, V V",Ter Arkh,661,6

But at the same time, while expressed on the surface of human cells, ACE2 is the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Expression of this receptor has been described in several types of cells, including hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), which raises a concern that the virus may infect and damage the stem cell compartment. We demonstrate for the first time that ACE2 and the entry-facilitating transmembrane protease TMPRSS2 are expressed on very small CD133+CD34+Lin-CD45- cells in human umbilical cord blood (UCB), which can be specified into functional HSCs and EPCs. The existence of these cells known as very small embryonic-like stem cells (VSELs) has been confirmed by several laboratories, and some of them may correspond to putative postnatal hemangioblasts. Moreover, we demonstrate for the first time that, in human VSELs and HSCs, the interaction of the ACE2 receptor with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein activates the Nlrp3 inflammasome, which if hyperactivated may lead to cell death by pyroptosis. Based on this finding, there is a possibility that human VSELs residing in adult tissues could be damaged by SARS-CoV-2, with remote effects on tissue/organ regeneration. We also report that ACE2 is expressed on the surface of murine bone marrow-derived VSELs and HSCs, although it is known that murine cells are not infected by SARS-CoV-2. Finally, human and murine VSELs express several RAAS genes, which sheds new light on the role of these genes in the specification of early-development stem cells. Graphical Abstract â¢Human VSELs and HSCs express ACE2 receptor for SARS-CoV2 entry. â¢Interaction of viral spike protein with ACE2 receptor may hyperactivate Nlrp3 inflammasome which induces cell death by pyroptosis. â¢SARS-CoV2 may also enter cells and eliminate them by cell lysis. â¢What is not shown since these cells express also Ang II receptor they may hyperactivate Nlrp3 inflammasome in response to Ang II which may induce pyroptosis.

482624,482624,482624,Recessions and health: The long-term health consequences of responses to the coronavirus,18.036678,3.9454122,2020,"Purpose: The government-led public healthcare services in Sri Lanka became a major strength in managing the COVID-19 comparatively well. However, natural hazards are a major threat to this healthcare system, as they cause severe damages, especially to curative healthcare infrastructures such as hospitals. Floods have been the major contributor to the economic loss of the Sri Lankan healthcare system. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to develop a proper flood risk assessment framework for Sri Lankan hospitals. Design/methodology/approach: This research study has attempted to develop a flood vulnerability assessment tool for hospitals using the concept of Depth Damage Functions (DDFs). Flood vulnerability curves have been developed for identified critical units of hospitals considering the damage caused to building contents which are predominantly expensive medical equipment. The damage caused only by wetting was considered in generating vulnerability curves. Structured interviews were conducted with government officials in the healthcare sector to gather details on the cost and damages of medical equipment. Pilot studies were carried out in two hospitals identified as located in flood-prone areas and have previous experiences of flooding, to acquire data regarding building contents of the critical units. Findings: The developed vulnerability curves indicate that no major damage would occur to building contents in critical units (other than the labor room) until the inundation depth reaches a value of 0.6–0.9 m (varies for each type of unit). It is also noteworthy that after a certain range in the inundation depth, the damage increases drastically, and building contents would incur total damage if the inundation depth passes a value of 1.2–1.5 m. Originality/value: This study explains the initial phase of developing a flood vulnerability assessment framework for Sri Lankan hospitals. Not many studies had been carried out to assess the vulnerability of hospitals specifically for floods using vulnerability curves. The study recommends a zoning system with pre-defined vulnerability levels for critical units during a flood, which can be associated with evacuation planning as well. Further studies must be carried out to verify this system for hospitals in Sri Lanka. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Koneswaran, B.; Siriwardana, C.; Jayasekara, R.

A patient-tailored program was developed to assess its efficacy regarding prevention of COVID-19 infection among patients with breast cancer undergoing surgery and healthcare workers (HCWs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: From March 9th to April 9th 2020, 91 patients were selected for elective surgery by means of: i) Pre-hospital screening aimed at avoiding hospitalization of symptomatic or suspicious COVID-19 patients, and ii) prioritisation of surgical procedure according to specific disease features. RESULTS: Eighty-five patients (93.4%) were fit for surgery, while five patients (5.5%) were temporarily excluded through 'telephone triage'; another two patients were excluded at in-hospital triage. A total of 71 out of 85 patients (83.5%) were diagnosed with invasive cancer, most of whom were undergoing breast-conserving surgery (61 out of 85 patients, 71.8%). The mean in-hospital stay was 2.2 days (SD=0.7 days). After hospital discharge, no patient needed re-admission due to post-operative complications; moreover, no COVID-19 infection among patients or HCWs was detected. CONCLUSION: Safe breast cancer surgery was accomplished for both patients and HCWs by means of a careful preoperative selection of patients and in-hospital preventative measures. This screening program can be transferred to high-volume Breast Units and it may be useful in implementing European Community recommendations for prevention of COVID-19 infection.","Fregatti, Piero; Gipponi, Marco; Giacchino, Maria; Sparavigna, Marco; Murelli, Federica; Toni, Maria Luisa; Calabrò, Maria Teresa; Orsino, Lina; Friedman, Daniele",In Vivo,661,14

This study examined the consequences of factors that might predict a change in the self-rated health of older adults and aimed to assess their monetary costs. In particular, two predisposing risk factor moderators were studied: high blood pressure and high cholesterol. The effects of these on two serious adverse cardiovascular events - heart attack and stroke - were estimated. Using data from the Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) carried out in 2014, a two-stage procedure was applied as well as pairwise comparison. The results revealed the significant role of socioeconomic status in health outcomes. Behavioural risk factors were found to be significant predictors for heart attack and stroke. The findings support the claim that variables such as age, wealth and behavioural risk factors are additional predictors of a change in these two diseases. The monetary consequences can reach up to 12.8 thousand Euros for older adults per unit of predisposing risk factor.

Many serological tests are available and require urgent independent validation. Here, we report performance characteristics of Orient Gene Biotech COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette (OG) and compare it to Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG immunoassay (ASIA). Patients (n = 102) with a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) were tested. The patients were asymptomatic (n = 2) or had mild (n = 37) or severe symptoms requiring hospitalization in a medical unit (n = 35) or intensive care unit (n = 28). Specificity was evaluated for 42 patients with previous viral and parasitic diseases as well as a high level of rheumatic factor. The sensitivity of OG was 95.8% (95% confidence interval [CI95%], 89.6 to 98.8) for samples collected &#8805;10 days after the onset of symptoms, which was equivalent to the sensitivity of ASIA of 90.5% (CI95%, 82.8 to 95.6). OG uncovered six false-negative results of ASIA, of which two had only IgM with OG. Specificity was 100% (CI95%, 93.4 to 100) with both tests on samples, including patients infected with endemic coronavirus. Overall, OG performance characteristics indicate that the test is suitable for routine use in clinical laboratories, and its performance is equivalent to that of immunoassay. Testing OG on a larger asymptomatic population may be needed to confirm these results.","Dellière, Sarah; Salmona, Maud; Minier, Marine; Gabassi, Audrey; Alanio, Alexandre; Le Goff, Jérôme; Delaugerre, Constance; Chaix, Marie-Laure",J. clin. microbiol,661,6

All 50 states closed schools in March 2020 despite uncertainty if school closure would be effective. Objective: To determine if school closure and its timing were associated with decreased COVID-19 incidence and mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants: US population-based observational study conducted between March 9, 2020, and May 7, 2020, using interrupted time series analyses incorporating a lag period to allow for potential policy-associated changes to occur. To isolate the association of school closure with outcomes, state-level nonpharmaceutical interventions and attributes were included in negative binomial regression models. States were examined in quartiles based on state-level COVID-19 cumulative incidence per 100â¯000 residents at the time of school closure. Models were used to derive the estimated absolute differences between schools that closed and schools that remained open as well as the number of cases and deaths if states had closed schools when the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was in the lowest quartile compared with the highest quartile. Exposures: Closure of primary and secondary schools. Main Outcomes and Measures: COVID-19 daily incidence and mortality per 100â¯000 residents. Results: COVID-19 cumulative incidence in states at the time of school closure ranged from 0 to 14.75 cases per 100â¯000 population. School closure was associated with a significant decline in the incidence of COVID-19 (adjusted relative change per week, -62% [95% CI, -71% to -49%]) and mortality (adjusted relative change per week, -58% [95% CI, -68% to -46%]). Both of these associations were largest in states with low cumulative incidence of COVID-19 at the time of school closure. For example, states with the lowest incidence of COVID-19 had a -72% (95% CI, -79% to -62%) relative change in incidence compared with -49% (95% CI, -62% to -33%) for those states with the highest cumulative incidence. In a model derived from this analysis, it was estimated that closing schools when the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was in the lowest quartile compared with the highest quartile was associated with 128.7 fewer cases per 100â¯000 population over 26 days and with 1.5 fewer deaths per 100â¯000 population over 16 days. Conclusions and Relevance: Between March 9, 2020, and May 7, 2020, school closure in the US was temporally associated with decreased COVID-19 incidence and mortality; states that closed schools earlier, when cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was low, had the largest relative reduction in incidence and mortality. However, it remains possible that some of the reduction may have been related to other concurrent nonpharmaceutical interventions.","Auger, Katherine A; Shah, Samir S; Richardson, Troy; Hartley, David; Hall, Matthew; Warniment, Amanda; Timmons, Kristen; Bosse, Dianna; Ferris, Sarah A; Brady, Patrick W; Schondelmeyer, Amanda C; Thomson, Joanna E",JAMA,661,32

Telemedicine provides a means to deliver clinical care while limiting patient and provider exposure to the COVID-19. As such, telemedicine is finding applications in a variety of clinical environments including primary care and the acute care setting and the array of patient populations who use telemedicine continues to grow. Yet as telehealth becomes ubiquitous, it is critical to consider its potential to exacerbate disparities in care. Challenges accessing technology and digital literacy, for example, disproportionately impact older patients and those living in poverty. When implemented with the consideration of health disparities, telemedicine provides an opportunity to address these inequities. This manuscript explores potential mechanisms by which telemedicine may play a role in exacerbating or ameliorating disparities in care. We further describe a framework and suggested strategies with which to implement telemedicine systems to improve health equity.","Samuels-Kalow, Margaret; Jaffe, Todd; Zachrison, Kori",Emerg Med J,661,24

Methods: We thus longitudinally evaluated and compared the total and neutralizing immune response of 61 patients to SARS-CoV-2 infection up to eight months after diagnosis by RT–PCR using several commercial assays. Results: Among the 208 samples tested, the percentage of seropositivity was comparable between assays up to four months after diagnosis and then tended to be more heterogeneous between assays (p &lt;0.05). The percentage of patients with a neutralizing titer decreased from 82% before two months postdiagnosis to 57% after six months. This decrease appeared to be more marked for patients under 65 years old and those not requiring hospitalization. The percentage of serology reversion at 6 months was from 11% with the WANTAI total assay to over 39% with the ABBOTT IgG assay. The neutralizing antibody titers decreased in parallel with the decrease of total antibody titers, with important heterogeneity between assays. Conclusions: In conclusion, serological tests show equivalent sensitivity in the first months after the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but their performance later, postinfection, must be considered when interpreting the results.","Aubry, Aurélien Demey Baptiste François Catherine Duverlie Gilles Castelain Sandrine Helle François Brochot Etienne",Journal of Clinical Medicine,661,1

For this specific population, evidence-based vaccination strategies are lacking. Here, we investigated humoral and cell mediated immune responses to SARS-CoV2 mRNA-based vaccines in patients receiving CD20-B-cell depleting agents for autoimmune disease, malignancy, or transplantation. MethodsPatients at the Bern University Hospital with a treatment history of anti-CD20 depleting agents (rituximab or ocrelizumab) were enrolled for analysis of humoral and cell-mediated immune responses (by interferon-{gamma} release assay) after completing vaccination against SARS-CoV2. Primary outcome was the the anti-spike antibody response in anti-CD20-treated patients (n=96) in comparison to immunocompetent controls (n=29). ResultsAnti-spike IgG antibodies were detected in 49% of patients 1.79 months after the second vaccine dose (interquartile range, IQR: 1.16-2.48) compared to 100% of controls (p<0.001). SARS-CoV2 specific interferon-{gamma} release was detected in 20% of patients and 75% of healthy controls (p<0.001). Only 11% of patients, but 75%of healthy controls showed positive reactions in both assays, respectively (p<0.001).

These complications can be the result of serious conditions such as chronic kidney disease (CKD), peptic ulcers, and recently COVID-19. Limited liver and kidney function leads to increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) within the body resulting in elevated levels of ammonia in the mouth, nose, and skin. Similarly, peptic ulcers, commonly from H. pylori, result in ammonia production from urea within the stomach. The presence of these biomarkers enables a potential screening protocol to be considered for frequent, non-invasive monitoring of these conditions. Unfortunately, detection of ammonia in these mediums is rather challenging due to relatively small concentrations and an abundance of interferents. Currently, there are no options available for non-invasive screening of these conditions continuously and in real-time. Here we demonstrate the selective detection of ammonia using a vapor phase thermodynamic sensing platform capable of being employed as part of a health screening protocol. The results show that our detection system has the remarkable ability to selectively detect trace levels of ammonia in the vapor phase using a single catalyst. Additionally, detection was demonstrated in the presence of interferents such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and acetone common in human breath. These results show that our thermodynamic sensors are well suited to selectively detect ammonia at levels that could potentially be useful for health screening applications.","Ricci, Peter P; Gregory, Otto J",Sci Rep,661,16

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices issued interim recommendations for Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines on December 12, 2020 (1), and December 19, 2020 (2), respectively; initial doses were recommended for health care personnel and long-term care facility (LTCF) residents (3). Safety monitoring for these vaccines has been the most intense and comprehensive in U.S. history, using the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a spontaneous reporting system, and v-safe,* an active surveillance system, during the initial implementation phases of the COVID-19 national vaccination program (4). CDC conducted descriptive analyses of safety data from the first month of vaccination (December 14, 2020-January 13, 2021). During this period, 13,794,904 vaccine doses were administered, and VAERS received and processed 6,994 reports of adverse events after vaccination, including 6,354 (90.8%) that were classified as nonserious and 640 (9.2%) as serious.§ The symptoms most frequently reported to VAERS were headache (22.4%), fatigue (16.5%), and dizziness (16.5%). A total of 113 deaths were reported to VAERS, including 78 (65%) among LTCF residents; available information from death certificates, autopsy reports, medical records, and clinical descriptions from VAERS reports and health care providers did not suggest any causal relationship between COVID-19 vaccination and death. Rare cases of anaphylaxis after receipt of both vaccines were reported (4.5 reported cases per million doses administered). Among persons who received Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, reactions reported to the v-safe system were more frequent after receipt of the second dose than after the first. The initial postauthorization safety profiles of the two COVID-19 vaccines in current use did not indicate evidence of unexpected serious adverse events.

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate the associations between serum albumin concentrations and COVID-19 disease severity and adverse outcomes. A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, from inception to October 30, 2020. Sixty-seven studies in 19,760 COVID-19 patients (6141 with severe disease or poor outcome) were selected for analysis. Pooled results showed that serum albumin concentrations were significantly lower in patients with severe disease or poor outcome (standard mean difference, SMD: - 0.99 g/L; 95% CI, - 1.11 to - 0.88, p < 0.001). In multivariate meta-regression analysis, age (t = - 2.13, p = 0.043), publication geographic area (t = 2.16, p = 0.040), white blood cell count (t = - 2.77, p = 0.008) and C-reactive protein (t = - 2.43, p = 0.019) were significant contributors of between-study variance. Therefore, lower serum albumin concentrations are significantly associated with disease severity and adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients. The assessment of serum albumin concentrations might assist with early risk stratification and selection of appropriate care pathways in this group.","Paliogiannis, Panagiotis; Mangoni, Arduino Aleksander; Cangemi, Michela; Fois, Alessandro Giuseppe; Carru, Ciriaco; Zinellu, Angelo",Clin. exp. med,661,20

Fifteen centimeters of colon with the anastomosis were resected to access anastomosis rupture pressure, colagen densitometry and histology features. Infection complication were twice higher in the shock group compared to the non-shock group. There was no statistic difference between groups relating to rupture pressure. However the total colagen concentration was higher in the non-shock group and histologic study showed better healing parameters in the non-shock group.

Herein, we performed first-principles calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations to explore the adsorption mechanism of Cd(II) on the basal surfaces of kaolinite. Representative monodentate and bidentate Cd(II) complexes were constructed on the Kln-Al(001) and Kln-Si(001Ì ) surfaces. The results showed that bidentate coordination of Cd(II) on the Kln-Al(001) surface was superior to all other studied models due to the favorable formation energy and better agreement with EXAFS data. The calculated electron density difference revealed the charge transfer from surface oxygen (Os) to Cd(II) upon adsorption. In particular, partial density of states (PDOS) analysis indicated that the Cd-Os bond exhibited covalent characteristics, attributed to the overlaps of Cd-5p and Os-2p orbitals in the valence band. Furthermore, radial distribution functions supported by AIMD simulations were employed to confirm the structural features of Cd(II) coordination shell at kaolinite-water interfaces.

SEARCH METHODS: PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, Scopus, and Web-of-Science databases were searched with no restrictions on publication status or year. SELECTION CRITERIA: Prospective and retrospective human studies about BAMP, in at least three patients, were included. Authors were contacted when necessary, and reference lists of the included studies were screened. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors undertook independent data extraction with conflict resolution by a third author. Risks of bias were assessed. A meta-analysis for estimates of changes for ANB angle, Wits appraisal, and incisor to mandibular plane angle (IMPA) angle of BAMP treatment compared to control groups was performed. RESULTS: A total of 449 articles were initially retrieved; 28 full-text articles met the inclusion criteria. Sample sizes ranged from 3 to 52 patients. There was heterogeneity in cephalometric outcomes reported, which prevented the comparison of certain outcomes. ANB angle improved more with BAMP in the maxilla combined with facemask (bone-anchored facemask, BAFM) compared to traditional facemask therapy: this was statistically but not clinically significant (0.2 degrees). No data are available for BAMP with skeletal anchorage in both jaws in combination with Class III elastics (bone-anchored Class III elastics, BAC3E). Likewise, no statistically significant differences in Wits appraisal were found (less than 1 mm). Lower incisor retroclination and facial height seemed to be better controlled with BAC3E compared to BAFM. CONCLUSIONS: The level of evidence available to support the maxillary advancement effect after BAMP was low. Publications reporting results based on identical samples tended to suggest overly positive results of BAMP. The differences in sagittal correction between BAMP and traditional facemask therapy were small and of questionable clinical significance. Long-term follow-up results are not available and, therefore, much needed. LIMITATIONS: Most articles had a low level of evidence and some included a historical control group.

The present work shows that the accuracy of such dynamics can be significantly improved by incorporating both local and global dynamics of the infection in disease models. To demonstrate improved accuracies, we extended a standard Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model by incorporating global dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic. The extended SIR model assumes three possibilities for the susceptible individuals traveling outside of their community: They can return to the community without any exposure to the infection, they can be exposed and develop symptoms after returning to the community, or they can be tested positive during the trip and remain quarantined until fully recovered. To examine the predictive accuracies of the extended SIR model, we studied the prevalence of the COVID-19 infection in Kansas City, Missouri influenced by the COVID-19 global pandemic. Using a two-step model-fitting algorithm, the extended SIR model was parameterized using the Kansas City, Missouri COVID-19 data during March to October 2020. The extended SIR model significantly outperformed the standard SIR model and revealed oscillatory behaviors with an increasing trend of infected individuals.

Objectives: The objective of the present work is to present the epidemiological variations in the production of fractures in the period of mandatory confinement in our reference population. Methods: Analytical retrospective comparative study of two groups of patients: Group A: patients admitted before the state of alarm that forced confinement in the period from January 13 to March 13 compared to Group B: patients admitted in the two months of confinement, until the de-escalation period began, March 13-May 13. Epidemiological variables including age, personal history, type of fracture, mechanism of injury, outpatient rate, and hospital stay were recorded. Results: A total of 190 patients were included. 112 in the pre-confinement period and 78 in the confinement (30% decrease). The mean age (p = 0.007) and falls at home (p < 0.001) were higher in the confinement group. The postoperative (p = 0.006) and overall (p < 0.001) hospital stay were significantly less in the confinement group. No differences were found in the anatomical location of the lesion, sex, comorbidities, mechanism of injury, outpatient rate, or death. Conclusions: Based on the results of our study, the period of forced confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic has produced a drastic decrease in the total number of fractures admitted to the traumatology service of a third level hospital. On the other hand, osteoporotic hip fractures have not varied in their incidence and a decrease in the average postoperative and overall stay has been observed.","González-Martín, D; Álvarez-De la Cruz, J; Martín-Vélez, P; Boluda-Mengod, J; Pais-Brito, J L; Herrera-Pérez, M",Rev. esp. cir. ortop. traumatol.

A review of international studies on the prevalence and diversity of the manifestations of postcoid syndrome is presented. The data on such a manifestation of post-COVID syndrome as postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) are accumulating. Pathogenetic mechanisms, modern diagnostic criteria and research data on the prevalence of this syndrome are presented in the article. The Canadian Cardiovascular Society has proposed medications as a treatment for POTS, including the sinus node If channel inhibitor ivabradine. Data from several studies showing the effectiveness of this drug for POTS, including after suffering COVID-19, are presented in the article. Clinical data on the prevalence of tachycardia among patients admitted to the Sechenov University hospital are presented. About 18% of patients with hypertension and 21% of patients with normal blood pressure had a high heart rate. A clinical example of the use of ivabradine in a patient after a coronavirus infection is presented. Drug interactions and individual tolerance of ivabradine in patients after coronavirus infection are being discussed.

By March 14, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a No Sail Order suspending U.S. cruise operations; the last U.S. passenger ship docked on April 16. METHODS: We analyzed SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks on cruises in U.S. waters or carrying U.S. citizens and used regression models to compare voyage characteristics. We used compartmental models to simulate the potential impact of four interventions (screening for COVID-19 symptoms; viral testing on two days and isolation of positive persons; reduction of passengers by 40%, crew by 20%, and port visits to one) for 7-day and 14-day voyages. RESULTS: During January 19-April 16, 2020, 89 voyages on 70 ships had known SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks; 16 ships had recurrent outbreaks. There were 1,669 RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and 29 confirmed deaths. Longer voyages were associated with more cases (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 1.10, 95% CI: 1.03-1.17, p < 0.0001). Mathematical models showed that 7-day voyages had about 70% fewer cases than 14-day voyages. On 7-day voyages, the most effective interventions were reducing the number of individuals onboard (43-49% reduction in total infections) and testing passengers and crew (42-43% reduction in total infections). All four interventions reduced transmission by 80%, but no single intervention or combination eliminated transmission. Results were similar for 14-day voyages. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks on cruises were common during January-April 2020. Despite all interventions modeled, cruise travel still poses a significant SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk.","Guagliardo, Sarah Anne J; Prasad, Pragati V; Rodriguez, Andrea; Fukunaga, Rena; Novak, Ryan T; Ahart, Lauren; Reynolds, Jared; Griffin, Isabel; Wiegand, Ryan; Quilter, Laura A S; Morrison, Stephanie; Jenkins, Keisha; Wall, Hilary K; Treffiletti, Aimee; White, Stefanie B; Regan, Joanna; Tardivel, Kara; Freeland, Amy; Brown, Clive; Wolford, Hannah; Johansson, Michael A; Cetron, Martin S; Slayton, Rachel B; Friedman, Cindy R",Clin. infect. dis,661,18

We evaluated patients' adherence to GRMT following AMI and the association with long-term (up-to 10 years) mortality, healthcare resource utilization and costs. METHODS: AMI patients hospitalized in a tertiary medical center in Israel that survived at least a year following post-discharge and enrolled in the two largest health plans were analyzed. Data were obtained from computerized medical records. Patients were defined as adherent when &#8805;80 % of the GRMT prescriptions were issue during the first post-discharge year. Hospitalizations, emergency department (ED) visits, primary care utilization and outpatient consulting clinic and other ambulatory services expenditure were calculated annually. RESULTS: Overall 8287 patients qualified for the study (mean age 65.0 ± 13.6 years, 69.7 % males). Adherent patients (n = 1767, 21.3 %) were more likely to be younger, women and increased prevalence of most traditional cardiovascular risk factors.

The effective drug target among coronaviruses is the main protease Mpro, because of its essential role in processing the polyproteins that are translated from the viral RNA. In this study, the bioactivity of some selected heterocyclic drugs named Favipiravir (1), Amodiaquine (2), 2'-Fluoro-2'-deoxycytidine (3), and Ribavirin (4) was evaluated as inhibitors and nucleotide analogues for COVID-19 using computational modeling strategies. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to estimate the thermal parameters, dipole moment, polarizability, and molecular electrostatic potential of the present drugs; additionally, Mulliken atomic charges of the drugs as well as the chemical reactivity descriptors were investigated. The nominated drugs were docked on SARS-CoV-2 main protease (PDB: 6LU7) to evaluate the binding affinity of these drugs. Besides, the computations data of DFT the docking simulation studies was predicted that the Amodiaquine (2) has the least binding energy (-7.77 Kcal/mol) and might serve as a good inhibitor to SARS-CoV-2 comparable with the approved medicines, hydroxychloroquine, and remdesivir which have binding affinity -6.06 and -4.96 Kcal/mol, respectively. The high binding affinity of 2 was attributed to the presence of three hydrogen bonds along with different hydrophobic interactions between the drug and the critical amino acids residues of the receptor. Finally, the estimated molecular electrostatic potential results by DFT were used to illustrate the molecular docking findings. The DFT calculations showed that drug 2 has the highest of lying HOMO, electrophilicity index, basicity, and dipole moment. All these parameters could share with different extent to significantly affect the binding affinity of these drugs with the active protein sites.","Hagar, Mohamed; Ahmed, Hoda A; Aljohani, Ghadah; Alhaddad, Omaima A",,661,1

Naturally produced secretome biologics include membrane-free signaling molecules and extracellular membrane vesicles (EVs) capable of regulating broad functional responses. The development of high-throughput screening pipelines for the identification and validation of NSC secretome targets is still in early development. Encouraging results from pre-clinical animal models of disease have highlighted secretome-based (acellular) therapeutics as providing significant improvements in biochemical and behavioral measurements. Most of these responses are being hypothesized to be the result of modulating and promoting the restoration of key inflammatory and regenerative programs in the CNS. Here, we will review the most recent findings regarding the identification of NSC-secreted factors capable of modulating the immune response to promote the regeneration of the CNS in animal models of CNS trauma and inflammatory disease and discuss the increased interest to refine the pro-regenerative features of the NSC secretome into a clinically available therapy in the emerging field of Regenerative Neuroimmunology.","Willis, Cory M; Nicaise, Alexandra M; Hamel, Regan; Pappa, Vasiliki; Peruzzotti-Jametti, Luca; Pluchino, Stefano",Front Cell Neurosci,661,24

Limited information is available regarding which patients will experience more severe disease symptoms. We evaluated hospitalized patients who were initially diagnosed with moderate COVID-19 for clinical parameters and radiological feature that showed an association with progression to severe/critical symptoms. METHODS: This study, a retrospective single-center study at the Central Hospital of Wuhan, enrolled 243 patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. Forty of these patients progressed from moderate to severe/critical symptoms during follow up. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiological data were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between moderate- and severe/critical-type symptoms. Univariable and multivariable logistic regressions were used to identify the risk factors associated with symptom progression. RESULTS: Patients with severe/critical symptoms were older (p < 0.001) and more often male (p = 0.046). A combination of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and high maximum chest computed tomography (CT) score was associated with disease progression. Maximum CT score (> 11) had the greatest predictive value for disease progression. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.861 (95% confidence interval: 0.811-0.902). CONCLUSIONS: Maximum CT score and COPD were associated with patient deterioration. Maximum CT score (> 11) was associated with severe illness.","Xiao, Jianwei; Li, Xiang; Xie, Yuanliang; Huang, Zengfa; Ding, Yi; Zhao, Shengchao; Yang, Pei; Du, Dan; Liu, Bin; Wang, Xiang",BMC Infect Dis,661,16

In this study, we sought to elucidate the pandemic's effects on mental health and access to care for perinatal individuals. METHODS: This cross-sectional study of individuals in Massachusetts who were pregnant or up to three months postpartum with a history of depressive symptoms examined associations between demographics and psychiatric symptoms (via validated mental health screening instruments) and the COVID-19 pandemic's effects on mental health and access to care. Chi-square associations and multivariate regression models were used. RESULTS: Of 163 participants, 80.8% perceived increased symptoms of depression and 88.8% of anxiety due to the pandemic. Positive screens for depression, anxiety, and/or PTSD at time of interview, higher education, and income were associated with increased symptoms of depression and anxiety due to the pandemic. Positive screens for depression, anxiety, and/or PTSD were also associated with perceived changes in access to mental healthcare. Compared to non-Hispanic White participants, participants of color (Black, Asian, Multiracial, and/or Hispanic/Latinx) were more likely to report that the pandemic changed their mental healthcare access (aOR:3.25, 95%CI:1.23, 8.59). LIMITATIONS: Limitations included study generalizability, given that participants have a history of depressive symptoms, and cross-sectional design. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic has increased symptoms of perinatal depression and anxiety and impacted perceived access to care. Self-reported increases in depression and anxiety and changes to healthcare access varied by education, race/ethnicity, income, and positive screens. Understanding these differences is important to address perinatal mental health and provide equitable care.","Masters, Grace A; Asipenko, Eugenia; Bergman, Aaron L; Person, Sharina D; Brenckle, Linda; Moore Simas, Tiffany A; Ko, Jean Y; Robbins, Cheryl L; Byatt, Nancy",J Psychiatr Res,661,1

(Special Issue: COVID-19: supporting scientific surge.),18.377594,3.7942953,2020,"Background: Hydroxychloroquine has been shown to inhibit entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into epithelial cells in vitro, but clinical studies found no evidence of reduced mortality when treating patients with COVID-19. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine for prevention of COVID-19 mortality, as opposed to treatment for the disease. Methods: We did a prespecified observational, population-based cohort study using national primary care data and linked death registrations in the OpenSAFELY platform, which covers approximately 40% of the general population in England, UK. We included all adults aged 18 years and older registered with a general practice for 1 year or more on March 1, 2020. We used Cox regression to estimate the association between ongoing routine hydroxychloroquine use before the COVID-19 outbreak in England (considered as March 1, 2020) compared with non-users of hydroxychloroquine and risk of COVID-19 mortality among people with rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus. Model adjustment was informed by a directed acyclic graph. Findings: Between Sept 1, 2019, and March 1, 2020, of 194â637 people with rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus, 30â569 (15·7%) received two or more prescriptions of hydroxychloroquine. Between March 1 and July 13, 2020, there were 547 COVID-19 deaths, 70 among hydroxychloroquine users. Estimated standardised cumulative COVID-19 mortality was 0·23% (95% CI 0·18 to 0·29) among users and 0·22% (0·20 to 0·25) among non-users; an absolute difference of 0·008% (-0·051 to 0·066). After accounting for age, sex, ethnicity, use of other immunosuppressive drugs, and geographical region, no association with COVID-19 mortality was observed (HR 1·03, 95% CI 0·80 to 1·33). We found no evidence of interactions with age or other immunosuppressive drugs. Quantitative bias analyses indicated that our observed associations were robust to missing information for additional biologic treatments for rheumatological disease. We observed similar associations with the negative control outcome of non-COVID-19 mortality. Interpretation: We found no evidence of a difference in COVID-19 mortality among people who received hydroxychloroquine for treatment of rheumatological disease before the COVID-19 outbreak in England. Therefore, completion of randomised trials investigating pre-exposure prophylactic use of hydroxychloroquine for prevention of severe outcomes from COVID-19 are warranted.

For the mathematics education students in a private university in Medan, Indonesia, studying at home is a new phenomenon. Students and lecturers must change the learning method without preparation due to the sudden pressure. This article examined this phenomenon. The method used was descriptive qualitative to describe the process of implementing distance learning, the media, and evaluation used in e-learning during the Covid-19 pandemic for mathematics education students. Data collection was conducted by a questionnaire administered to 200 lecturers, interviews, and direct observation. The results show that Group Chat via WhatsApp was the most widely used online communication media, especially the Baby Boomers and Generation X, but millennials used online multimedia more frequently. The implementation has several shortcomings: the lack of interaction between instructors and students, students being asked to learn independently and do independent projects, teachers using more than one media not following the teaching-load hours or spending less time, and many experiencing technical obstacles.","Siregar, G.

METHODS: A cohort-based probabilistic simulation model, informed by the latest epidemiological estimates on COVID-19 in the United States provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and literature review. Heterogeneity of parameter values across age group was accounted for. The main outcome studied was QALYs for the infected patient, patient's family members, and the contagion effect of the infected patient over the duration of the pandemic. RESULTS: Averting a COVID-19 infection in a representative US resident will generate an additional 0.061 (0.016-0.129) QALYs (for the patient: 0.055, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.014-0.115; for the patient's family members: 0.006, 95% CI 0.002-0.015). Accounting for the contagion effect of this infection, and assuming that an effective vaccine will be available in 3 months, the total QALYs gains from averting 1 single infection is 1.51 (95% CI 0.28-4.37) accrued to patients and their family members affected by the index infection and its sequelae. These results were robust to most parameter values and were most influenced by effective reproduction number, probability of death outside the hospital, the time-varying hazard rates of hospitalization, and death in critical care. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the health benefits of averting 1 COVID-19 infection in the United States are substantial. Efforts to curb infections must weigh the costs against these benefits.","Basu, Anirban; Gandhay, Varun J",Value Health,661,30

Existing volume visualization methods, however, cannot cope with its very low signal-to-noise ratio. In order to design more powerful transfer functions, we propose to leverage soft segmentation as an explicit component of visualization for noisy volumes. Our technical realization is based on semi-supervised learning where we combine the advantages of two segmentation algorithms. A first weak segmentation algorithm provides good results for propagating sparse user provided labels to other voxels in the same volume. This weak segmentation algorithm is used to generate dense pseudo labels. A second powerful deep-learning based segmentation algorithm can learn from these pseudo labels to generalize the segmentation to other unseen volumes, a task that the weak segmentation algorithm fails at completely. The proposed volume visualization uses the deep-learning based segmentation as a component for segmentation-aware transfer function design. Appropriate ramp parameters can be suggested automatically through histogram analysis. Finally, our visualization uses gradient-free ambient occlusion shading to further suppress visual presence of noise, and to give structural detail desired prominence. The cryo-ET data studied throughout our technical experiments is based on the highest-quality tilted series of intact SARS-CoV-2 virions. Our technique shows the high impact in target sciences for visual data analysis of very noisy volumes that cannot be visualized with existing techniques.","Nguyen, Ngan; Bohak, Ciril; Engel, Dominik; Mindek, Peter; Strnad, Ondvrej; Wonka, Peter; Li, Sai; Ropinski, Timo; Viola, Ivan",,661,1

The present scoring system may help assess disease severity and oxygen supply requirements in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Data on patient characteristics at baseline and throughout hospitalization for COVID-19 were extracted from medical records. Disease severity was dichotomized into two categories without or with oxygen supply as asymptomatic, mild, and moderate illness (AMMI), and severe and critical illness (CSI). The AMMI and CSI groups were compared. Predictors of disease severity, previously identified in the outpatient setting, were included in multivariable logistic regression analysis; the obtained coefficients were converted to integers and assigned a score. RESULTS: A total of 206 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were included in this study. Correlation between COVID-19 severity and medical information was examined by comparing AMMI and CSI. Age, hemodialysis, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were candidate predictors of the need for oxygen supply in patients with COVID-19. Coefficients associated with age, hemodialysis, and CRP were as follows: 1 × age (in years, coded as 0 for values of <50, and as 1 for values of &#8805;50) + 1 × hemodialysis (coded as 0 for ""no"", and as 1 for ""yes"") + 1 × CRP (in mg/dL, coded as 0 for values of <1.0, and as 1 for values of &#8805;1.0). Patients with scores of &#8805;2 points required oxygen supply (sensitivity, 68.4%; specificity, 79.0%) CONCLUSION: The present model can help predict disease severity and oxygen requirements in COVID-19 patients in Japan.","Kitajima, Heita; Hirashima, Tomonori; Suzuki, Hidekazu; Arai, Tsuyoshi; Tamura, Yoshitaka; Hashimoto, Shoji; Morishita, Hiroshi; Matsuoka, Hiroto; Kashiwa, Yozo; Han, Yuki; Minamoto, Seijiro; Tanaka, Toshio; Nagai, Takayuki",J Infect Chemother,661,16

Huge efforts from pharmacological industries have led to the development of COVID-19 vaccines. In particular two mRNA vaccines, namely the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and the mRNA-1273 (Moderna), and a viral-vectored vaccine, i.e. ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AstraZeneca), have recently been approved in Europe. Clinical trials on these vaccines have been published on the general population showing a high efficacy with minor adverse events. However, specific data about the efficacy and safety of these vaccines in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) are still lacking. Moreover, the limited availability of these vaccines requires prioritizing some vulnerable categories of patients compared to others. In this position paper, we propose the point of view about the management of COVID-19 vaccination from Italian experts on IMIDs and the identification of high-risk groups according to the different diseases and their chronic therapy.","Ferretti, Francesca; Cannatelli, Rosanna; Benucci, Maurizio; Carmagnola, Stefania; Clementi, Emilio; Danelli, Piergiorgio; Dilillo, Dario; Fiorina, Paolo; Galli, Massimo; Gallieni, Maurizio; Genovese, Giovanni; Giorgi, Valeria; Invernizzi, Alessandro; Maconi, Giovanni; Maier, Jeanette A; Marzano, Angelo V; Morpurgo, Paola S; Nebuloni, Manuela; Radovanovic, Dejan; Riva, Agostino; Rizzardini, Giuliano; Sabiu, Gianmarco; Santus, Pierachille; Staurenghi, Giovanni; Zuccotti, Gianvincenzo; Sarzi-Puttini, Pier Carlo; Ardizzone, Sandro",Front Immunol,661,16

While there are numerous options for enrichment/isolation of cells from tissues, fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) is accepted as a method that results in superior purification of a wide variety of cell types. Flow cytometry requires extensive fluidics and aerosol droplets can be generated during collection of target cells. Pathogens such as Francisella tularensis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Yersinia pestis, and SARS-CoV-2 require manipulation at biosafety level-3 (BSL-3). Due to the concern of potential aerosolization of these pathogens, use of flow cytometric-based cell sorting in these laboratory settings requires placement of the equipment in dedicated biosafety cabinets within the BSL-3. For many researchers, this is often not possible due to expense, space, or expertise available. Here we describe the safety validation and utility of a completely closed cell sorter that results in gentle, rapid, high purity, and safe sorting of cells on the benchtop at BSL-3. We also provide data demonstrating the need for cell sorting versus bead purification and the applicability of this technology for BSL-3 and potentially BSL-4 related infectious disease projects. Adoption of this technology will significantly expand our ability to uncover important features of the most dangerous infectious diseases leading to faster development of novel vaccines and therapeutics.","Roberts, Lydia M; Anderson, Rebecca; Carmody, Aaron; Bosio, Catharine M",,661,1

501867,501867,501867,[Recommendations for Performing Bronchoscopy in Times of the COVID-19 Pandemic],18.24996,3.656188,2020,"BACKGROUND: As COVID-19 infections worldwide exceed 6 million confirmed cases, the data reveal that the first wave of the outbreak is coming to an end in many European countries. There is variation in the testing strategies (eg, massive testing vs testing only those displaying symptoms) and the strictness of lockdowns imposed by countries around the world. For example, Brazil's mitigation measures lie between the strict lockdowns imposed by many European countries and the more liberal approach taken by Sweden. This can influence COVID-19 metrics (eg, total deaths, confirmed cases) in unexpected ways. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of local authorities' strategies in managing the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, South America, and the United States. METHODS: The early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak in Brazil was compared to Europe using the weekly transmission rate. Using the European data as a basis for our analysis, we examined the spread of COVID-19 and modeled curves pertaining to daily confirmed cases and deaths per million using skew-normal probability density functions. For Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States, we forecasted the end of the pandemic, and for Brazil, we predicted the peak value for daily deaths per million. We also discussed additional factors that could play an important role in the fight against COVID-19, such as the fast response of local authorities, testing strategies, number of beds in the intensive care unit, and isolation strategies adopted. RESULTS: The European data analysis demonstrated that the transmission rate of COVID-19 increased similarly for all countries in the initial stage of the pandemic but changed as the total confirmed cases per million in each country grew. This was caused by the variation in timely action by local authorities in adopting isolation measures and/or massive testing strategies. The behavior of daily confirmed cases for the United States and Brazil during the early stage of the outbreak was similar to that of Italy and Sweden, respectively. For daily deaths per million, transmission in the United States was similar to that of Switzerland, whereas for Brazil, it was greater than the counts for Portugal, Germany, and Austria (which had, in terms of total deaths per million, the best results in Europe) but lower than other European countries. CONCLUSIONS: The fitting skew parameters used to model the curves for daily confirmed cases per million and daily deaths per million allow for a more realistic prediction of the end of the pandemic and permit us to compare the mitigation measures adopted by local authorities by analyzing their respective skew-normal parameters. The massive testing strategy adopted in the early stage of the pandemic by German authorities made a positive difference compared to other countries like Italy where an effective testing strategy was adopted too late. This explains why, despite a strictly indiscriminate lockdown, Italy's mortality rate was one of the highest in the world.","De Leo, S.",JMIRx Med,661,10

Evaluation of biomarkers predicting severity is crucial to identify patients at high risk of disease progression and poor prognosis. Serum Amyloid A (SAA) is an acute-phase protein mainly produced by the liver in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines. In this study, we investigated SAA levels at admission (T1) and after 15 days (T2) of hospitalization in two groups of patients: survivors and non-survivors. At T1, the non-survivors showed higher SAA level than survivors (74 mg/dL vs 48.75 mg/dL). At T2, the survivor group value decreased to 6.55 mg/dL, the non-survivor group still showed high levels (51.1 mg/dL). The SAA level in control group was 0.35 mg/dL. Furthermore, a cut-off value of 63 mg/dL able to discriminate survivors from non-survivors was established by ROC curve analysis at T1. At T2, the cut-off decreased to 30.9 mg/dL. A similar decreasing trend was observed for D-Dimer, hsCRP, IL-6 and procalcitonin levels. The results of this retrospective study suggest that SAA is a good marker of COVID-19 disease alone and/or in combination with other inflammatory biomarkers. Identification of reliable prognostic analytes is of great clinical relevance, as it would improve patient management besides being costs saving.","Pieri, M.; Ciotti, M.; Nuccetelli, M.; Perrone, M.

We investigated the distribution of these effects across the connectome and their relationship with age-related differences in dopamine (DA) D1 receptor availability and gray matter density (GMD). With this aim, we determined aging effects on mean and interindividual variance of FC using fMRI in 30 younger and 30 older healthy subjects and mapped the contribution of each connection to the patterns of age-related similarity loss. Aging effects on mean FC accounted mainly for the dissimilarity between connectomes of younger and older adults, and were related, across brain regions, to aging effects on DA D1 receptor availability. Aging effects on the variance of FC indicated a global increase in variance with advancing age, explained connectome dissimilarity among older subjects and were related to aging effects on variance of GMD. The relationship between aging and the similarity of connectomes can thus be partly explained by age differences in DA modulation and gray matter structure.","Garzón, Benjamín; Lövdén, Martin; de Boer, Lieke; Axelsson, Jan; Riklund, Katrine; Bäckman, Lars; Nyberg, Lars; Guitart-Masip, Marc",Brain struct. funct,661,22

Many Asian countries are starting to vaccinate frontline workers; however, expedited vaccine development has led to hesitancy among the general population. We evaluated the willingness of healthcare workers to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. METHODS: From 12 to 21 December 2020, we recruited 1720 healthcare workers from 6 countries: China, India, Indonesia, Singapore, Vietnam and Bhutan. The self-administrated survey collected information on willingness to vaccinate, perception of COVID-19, vaccine concerns, COVID-19 risk profile, stigma, pro-socialness scale, and trust in health authorities. RESULTS: More than 95% of the healthcare workers surveyed were willing to vaccinate. These respondents were more likely to perceive the pandemic as severe, consider the vaccine safe, have less financial concerns, less stigmatization regarding the vaccine, higher pro-socialness mindset and trust in health authorities. A high perceived pandemic risk index, low vaccine harm index and high pro-socialness index were independent predictors in multivariable analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of healthcare workers in Asia are willing to receive COVID-19 vaccination. Perceived COVID-19 susceptibility, low potential risk of vaccine harm and pro-socialness are the main drivers.

PURPOSE: Nonadherence is a leading cause of death-censored allograft loss in kidney transplant recipients. Strong associations have tied tacrolimus intrapatient variability (IPV) to degree of nonadherence and high tacrolimus IPV to clinical endpoints such as rejection and allograft loss. Nonadherence is a dynamic, complex problem best targeted by multidimensional interventions, including mobile health (mHealth) technologies. METHODS: This was a secondary planned analysis of a 12-month, parallel, 2-arm, semiblind, 1:1 randomized controlled trial involving 136 adult kidney transplant recipients. The primary aims of the TRANSAFE Rx study were to assess the efficacy of a pharmacist-led, mHealth-based intervention in improving medication safety and health outcomes for kidney transplant recipients as compared to usual care. RESULTS: Patients were randomized equally to 68 patients per arm. The intervention arm demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in tacrolimus IPV over time as compared to the control arm (P = 0.0133). When analyzing a clinical goal of tacrolimus IPV of less than 30%, the 2 groups were comparable at baseline (P = 0.765), but significantly more patients in the intervention group met this criterion at month 12 (P = 0.033). In multivariable modeling, variables that independently impacted tacrolimus IPV included time, treatment effect, age, and warm ischemic time. CONCLUSION: This secondary planned analysis of an mHealth-based, pharmacist-led intervention demonstrated an association between the active intervention in the trial and improved tacrolimus IPV. Further prospective studies are required to confirm the mutability of tacrolimus IPV and impact of reducing tacrolimus IPV on long-term clinical outcomes.","Fleming, James N; Gebregziabher, M; Posadas, A; Su, Z; McGillicuddy, J W; Taber, D J",Am. j. health system pharm,661,16

We hypothesized that pandemic mitigation measures might reduce sexually transmitted infection (STI) screening and/or transmission. METHODS: We used King County, WA STI surveillance and sexual health clinic (SHC) data from January 1, 2019, to July 31, 2020. We calculated mean weekly case counts for gonorrhea, primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis, male urethral gonorrhea, and early latent (EL) syphilis for 3 periods in 2020: pre-SHSH (January 1-March 23), SHSH (March 24-June 5), and reopening (June 6-July 31). Primary and secondary syphilis and male urethral gonorrhea were used as proxies for sexual behavior, and EL syphilis was used as a proxy for STI screening. We compared SHC visits (2019 vs. 2020) and SHC gonorrhea treatment practices (across 2020 periods). RESULTS: Compared with January to July 2019, from January to July 2020, reported cases of gonorrhea, male urethral gonorrhea, P&S syphilis, and EL syphilis decreased by 9%, 5%, 16%, and 22%, respectively. Mean weekly case counts of gonorrhea, male urethral gonorrhea, and EL syphilis decreased pre-SHSH to SHSH, but all returned to pre-SHSH levels during reopening. Sexual health clinic visits during SHSH were 55% lower in 2020 than in 2019. In the SHC during SHSH, ceftriaxone treatment of gonorrhea decreased, whereas cefixime/cefpodoxime treatment and gonorrhea treatment with no testing increased. CONCLUSIONS: Decreases in reported STIs concurrent with COVID-19 SHSH may reflect a true decline in STI transmission. However, the larger decreases in asymptomatic infections indicate that much of the observed decrease was likely due to decreased screening.","Berzkalns, Anna; Thibault, Christina S; Barbee, Lindley A; Golden, Matthew R; Khosropour, Christine; Kerani, Roxanne P",Sex Transm Dis,661,14

With the outbreak of COVID-19, many proposed models for eye location and state evaluation based on facial landmarks are unreliable due to mask coverings. In this paper, we proposed a robust facial landmark location model for eye location and state evaluation. First, we develop an existing lightweight face alignment model for eye key point locations that is robust in large poses. Then, to develop the performance of our model in a complex driving environment such as an environment with mask coverings, changing illumination, etc., we design a method to augment the training data set based on the original landmark data set without any extra cost. Finally, some facial landmarks around the eyes are extracted, and the eye aspect ratio (EAR) is introduced to evaluate the eye state based on eye key points. The experiment shows that our model achieves significantly improved landmark location performance on a driving simulation data set due to data augmentation. We tested our model on the BioID data set to measure the eye state evaluation performance, and the results showed that our model obtained satisfactory performance with an accuracy of approximately 97.7%. Further testing on the driving simulation data set shows that our model is robust in different driving scenarios with an average accuracy of approximately 93.9%.

It is carried out in a variety of clinical settings in hospitals and primary care, and its use is standard practice among high-risk, critically ill patients, and those who have undergone cardiac surgery. ECG recording is classified into two main categories: monitoring and diagnostic. 12-lead ECGs, which require electrodes to be placed on the chest and each limb, are used for diagnostic purposes, whereas 3- or 5-lead ECGs are used for rhythm monitoring. Cross-infection can arise from reusing ECG cables, even if they have been cleaned. Surgical site infection is a particular risk in patients who have undergone coronary artery bypass grafting, because ECG wires are placed on the chest close to the incision site. Single-use ECG leads, such as the Kendall DL&#8482; ECG cable and lead wire system, reduce the risk of cross-contamination between patients and free nursing time for patient care because they are discarded after use and do not have to be cleaned and disinfected for use with another patient.","Bloe, Charlie",Br J Nurs,661,16

METHODS: This report is a sub-analysis of a larger qualitative study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with PWID admitted to an academic medical center from 2017 to 2020 for an invasive injection-related infection. Standard qualitative analysis techniques, consisting of both inductive and deductive approaches, were used to identify and characterize the effects of COVID-19 on participants. RESULTS: Among the 30 PWID interview participants, 14 reported barriers to accessing health and addiction services due to COVID-19. As facilities decreased appointment availability or transitioned to telemedicine, PWID reported being unable to access services. Social distancing led to isolation or loneliness during hospital stays and in the community. Recovery meetings and support groups, critical to addiction recovery, were particularly affected. Other participants reported that uncertainty and fear of contracting the virus generated changes in behavior that led them to avoid seeking services. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has disrupted health systems and social services, leading PWID to experience unprecedented barriers to accessing and maintaining health and addiction services in both inpatient and outpatient settings. Opioid use disorder management must be understood as a holistic process, and a multidisciplinary approach to ensuring comprehensive care, even in the midst of this pandemic, is needed.","Gleason, Emily; Nolan, Nathanial S; Marks, Laura R; Habrock, Tracey; Liang, Stephen Y; Durkin, Michael J",Journal of addiction medicine (Online),661,16

In the wake of COVID-19, in response to shortages and lack of availability of surgical masks and respirators, the use of cloth masks has become a research focus. Various fabrics have been promoted with little evidence-based foundation and without guidelines on design principles for optimal performance. In these circumstances, it is essential to understand the properties, key performance factors, filter mechanisms and evidence on cloth masks materials. The general community might also need to decontaminate and reuse disposable, single-use devices as a last resort. We present an overview of the filter materials, filter mechanisms and effectiveness, key performance factors, and hydrophobicity of the common disposable masks, as well as cloth masks. We also reviewed decontamination methods for disposable respiratory devices. As an alternative to surgical masks and respirators, we recommend a cloth mask made of at least three layers (300-350 threads per inch) and adding a nylon stocking layer over the mask for a better fit. Water-resistant fabrics (polyesters/nylon), blends of fabrics and water-absorbing fabrics (cotton) should be in the outside layer, middle layer/layers and inside layer, respectively.

The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was the etiologic agent of this disease, and responsible of the current pandemic of COVID-19. Accumulated evidence on placental features is based most on case-reports and small case-series, with differing results. METHODS: We gathered a cohort of 29 infected pregnant mothers who delivered 32 newborns, and had placentas available for pathologic examination. Placentas were compared with a control group. RESULTS: Of the 29 mothers, clinical and radiological features were similar to what was already described in COVID-19. Pregnancy modified some analytical parameters. One of the mothers succumbed to the disease. Of the 32 newborns, 1 developed an early infection, with positive reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at 48 h of life, with an initial RT-PCR negative. SARS-CoV-2 presence was assessed on placental tissue with immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR, both were negative. All newborns had good clinical outcomes. No differences in morphological placental findings were found among both groups. CONCLUSION: Lack of statistically significant differences among case and control groups suggest that placentas from SARS-CoV-2 infected mothers represent a cohort of normal placentas only submitted because of maternal SARS-CoV-2 status. To the best of our knowledge, no irrefutable cases of vertical transmission have been yet described. Other authors have failed to demonstrate presence of viral RNA in placental tissue.

OBJECTIVES: To map pre- and postexposure prophylactic (PrEP and PEP) candidate for COVID-19. DATA SOURCES: PubMed/Medline, Embase, International Committee of Medical Journal Editors and International Clinical Trials Registry Platform clinical trial registries and medRxiv. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AND PARTICIPANTS: All studies in humans or animals and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in humans reporting primary data on prophylactic candidates against COVID-19, excluding studies focused on key populations. INTERVENTIONS: PrEP and PEP candidate for COVID-19. METHODS: Systematic review and qualitative synthesis of COVID-19 PrEP and PEP studies and RCTs complemented by search of medRxiv and PubMed and Embase for studies reporting RCT outcomes since systematic review search completion. RESULTS: We identified 13 studies (from 2119 database records) and 117 RCTs (from 5565 RCTs listed in the registries) that met the inclusion criteria. Non-RCT studies reported on cross-sectional studies using hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in humans (n = 2) or reported on animal studies (n = 7), most of which used antibodies. All five completed RCTs focused on the use of HCQ as either PrEP or PEP, and these and the cross-sectional studies reported no prophylactic effect. The majority of ongoing RCTs evaluated HCQ or other existing candidates including non-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines, anti(retro)virals or use of vitamins and supplements. CONCLUSIONS: The key message from completed studies and RCTs seems to be that HCQ does not work. There is little evidence regarding other compounds, with all RCTs using candidates other than HCQ still ongoing. It remains to be seen if the portfolio of existing molecules being evaluated in RCTs will identify successful prophylaxis against COVID-19 or if there is a need for the development of new candidates.","Smit, Mikaela; Marinosci, Annalisa; Agoritsas, Thomas; Calmy, Alexandra",Clin. microbiol. infect,661,10

Given the cost Ctotal, the rumor clarifying problem aims to find a seed set with at most k users such that the total number of the users influenced by positive information can be maximized. In this paper, we propose a Cost-Randomized Greedy algorithm called CRG to solve the rumor clarifying problem.

It has been proposed that the environmental and immune pressures associated with different contexts of infection have different consequences for the associated bacterial populations, affecting drug susceptibility and the emergence of resistance. However, there is little concrete evidence for this model. We prospectively collected sputum samples from 18 newly diagnosed and treatment-naïve patients with tuberculosis and sequenced 795 colony-derived Mtb isolates. Mutant accumulation rates varied considerably between different bacilli isolated from the same individual, and where high rates of mutation were observed, the mutational spectrum was consistent with reactive oxygen species-induced mutagenesis. Elevated bacterial mutation rates were identified in isolates from HIV-negative but not HIV-positive individuals, suggesting that they were immune-driven. These results support the model that mutagenesis of Mtb in vivo is modulated by the host environment, which could drive the emergence of variants associated with drug resistance in a host-dependent manner.","Liu, Qingyun; Wei, Jianhao; Li, Yawei; Wang, Mei; Su, Jun; Lu, Yonghui; López, Mariana G; Qian, Xueqin; Zhu, Zhaoqin; Wang, Haiying; Gan, Mingyun; Jiang, Qi; Fu, Yun-Xin; Takiff, Howard E; Comas, Iñaki; Li, Feng; Lu, Xuemei; Fortune, Sarah M; Gao, Qian",Sci.

We analysed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the conduct of paediatric cancer phase I-II trials in Europe through the experience of the Innovative Therapies for Children with Cancer (ITCC). METHODS: A survey was sent to all ITCC-accredited early-phase clinical trial hospitals including questions about impact on staff activities, recruitment, patient care, supply of investigational products and legal aspects, between 1st March and 30th April 2020. RESULTS: Thirty-one of 53 hospitals from 12 countries participated. Challenges reported included staff constraints (30% drop), reduction in planned monitoring activity (67% drop of site initiation visits and 64% of monitoring visits) and patient recruitment (61% drop compared with that in 2019). The percentage of phase I, phase II trials and molecular platforms closing to recruitment in at least one site was 48.5%, 61.3% and 64.3%, respectively. In addition, 26% of sites had restrictions on performing trial assessments because of local contingency plans. Almost half of the units suffered impact upon pending contracts. Most hospitals (65%) are planning on improving organisational and structural changes. CONCLUSION: The study reveals a profound disruption of paediatric cancer early-phase clinical research due to the COVID-19 pandemic across Europe. Reported difficulties affected both patient care and monitoring activity. Efforts should be made to reallocate resources to avoid lost opportunities for patients and to allow the continued advancement of oncology research. Identified adaptations to clinical trial procedures may be integrated to increase preparedness of clinical research to futures crises.","Rubio-San-Simón, Alba; André, Nicolas; Cefalo, Maria Giuseppina; Aerts, Isabelle; Castañeda, Alicia; Benezech, Sarah; Makin, Guy; van Eijkelenburg, Natasha; Nysom, Karsten; Marshall, Lynley; Gambart, Marion; Hladun, Raquel; Rossig, Claudia; Bergamaschi, Luca; Fagioli, Franca; Carpenter, Ben; Ducassou, Stephane; Owens, Cormac; Øra, Ingrid; Ribelles, Antonio Juan; De Wilde, Bram; Guerra-García, Pilar; Strullu, Marion; Rizzari, Carmelo; Ek, Torben; Hettmer, Simone; Gerber, Nicolas U; Rawlings, Christine; Diezi, Manuel; Palmu, Sauli; Ruggiero, Antonio; Verdú, Jaime; de Rojas, Teresa; Vassal, Gilles; Geoerger, Birgit; Moreno, Lucas; Bautista, Francisco",Eur J Cancer,661,16

Contrary to past research suggesting that the increased salience of a disease threat should improve attitudes toward vaccines, we observed a decrease in intentions of getting a COVID-19 vaccine when one becomes available. We further found a decline in general vaccine attitudes and intentions of getting the influenza vaccine. Analyses of heterogeneity indicated that this decline is driven by participants who identify as Republicans, who showed a negative trend in vaccine attitudes and intentions, whereas Democrats remained largely stable. Consistent with research on risk perception and behavior, those with less favorable attitudes toward a COVID-19 vaccination also perceived the virus to be less threatening.

However, there are only limited data regarding the precise prevalence of the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia. Here, to estimate the magnitude of SARS-CoV-2 infection in East Java, Indonesia, we investigated the prevalence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. We enrolled 1,819 individuals from June to December 2020 and observed that the subjects' overall prevalence of IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 was 11.4% (207/1,819). The prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies differed significantly between the job/occupation groups (P = 0.0001). A greater prevalence of IgG was detected in laboratory technicians (who take samples from suspected cases and deal with polymerase chain reaction [PCR] procedures, 22.2%) compared to medical personnel who see and take direct care of patients with COVID-19 (e.g., physicians and nurses, 6.0%), other staff in medical facilities (2.9%), general population (12.1%) and non-COVID-19 patients (14.6%). The highest prevalence among age groups was in the 40-49-year-olds (14.8%), and the lowest prevalence was in the 20-29-year-olds (7.4%). However, the younger population still showed a higher prevalence than generally reported, suggesting greater exposure to the virus but less susceptibility to the disease. A geographical difference was also observed: a higher prevalence in Surabaya (13.1%) than in Jombang (9.9%). In conclusion, the COVID-19 outbreak among asymptomatic populations was characterized by a high prevalence of infection in East Java, Indonesia.","Megasari, Ni Luh Ayu; Utsumi, Takako; Yamani, Laura Navika; Gunawan, Emily; Furukawa, Koichi; Nishimura, Mitsuhiro; Lusida, Maria Inge; Mori, Yasuko",PLoS One,661,1

Among survivors, kidney outcomes, seroconversion, and persistence of viral shedding are unexplored. METHODS: Single-center prospective cohort study including data from kidney transplant recipients with confirmed COVID-19 between 03/20/2020 and 07/31/2020. Outcomes were adjudicated until 08/31/2020 or the date of death. RESULTS: There were 491 patients with COVID-19 among the 11 875 recipients in follow-up. The majority was middle-aged with 1 or more comorbidities. Thirty-one percent were treated at home, 69% required hospitalization. Among the hospitalized, 61% needed intensive care, 75% presented allograft dysfunction and 46% needed dialysis. Overall 28-day fatality rate was 22% and, among hospitalized patients, 41%. Age (OR 3.08, 95%CI 1.86-5.09), diabetes mellitus (OR 1.69, 95%CI 1.06-2.72), and cardiac disease (OR 2.00, 95%CI 1.09-3.68) were independent factors for death. Among the 351 survivors, 19% sustained renal graft dysfunction, and there were 13 (4%) graft losses. Biopsy (n=20) findings were diverse but decisive to guide treatment and estimate prognosis. Seroconversion was observed in 79% of the survivors and was associated with disease severity. Persistence of viral shedding was observed in 21% of the patients without detectable clinical implications. CONCLUSIONS: This prospective cohort analysis confirms the high 28-days fatality rate of COVID-19, associated primarily with age and comorbidities. The high incidence of allograft dysfunction was associated with a wide range of specific histologic lesions and high rates of sequelae and graft loss.

The formal name given to 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization is COVID-19, while the International Committee on Taxonomy has named it severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Due to this viral attack, nations around the world have issued lockdown restrictions. Presently, there is no effective way to control the spread of 2019-nCoV, except through social distancing and hygienic activities. World-class scientists and researchers are trying to develop vaccines and medicines that will cure this deadly viral disease and control its spread. Our aim in presenting this article is to provide an easy therapeutic approach that effectively combats deadly viral diseases, such as COVID-19, with minimal intervention and effort. Different Ayurvedic therapeutic agents (Curcuma longa L, green tea, and Piper nigrum) inhibit the entry of viruses in the host cell and the transmission of pathogens, while improving immunity. Curcumin and piperine (1-piperoylpiperidine) interact with each other and form a &#960;-&#960; intermolecular complex that enhances the bioavailability of curcumin by inhibition of glucuronidation of curcumin in the liver. Two molecules, curcumin and catechin, bind directly to the receptor-binding domain of the S-protein and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor of the host cell, by which these molecules inhibit the entry of viruses in the host cell. As a result, the animal host will survive the infection.","Kumar, Gajendra; Kumar, Dharmendra; Singh, Netra Pal","Drug res. (Stuttg., 2013, Internet)",661,33

Common symptoms include persistent breathlessness, fatigue and cough. Other symptoms reported include chest pain, palpitations, neurological and cognitive deficits, rashes, and gastrointestinal dysfunction. We present a complex case of a previously well 28-year-old woman who was diagnosed with COVID-19. After resolution of her acute symptoms, she continued to experience retrosternal discomfort, shortness of breath, poor memory and severe myalgia. Investigations yielded no significant findings.

In times of an infectious epidemic where medical subspecialties lead the frontline, a surgeon's role becomes rather vague. However, the only obstacle that stands in between the surgeon and fighting in the frontline of an infectious disease outbreak, is the traditional perception of what a surgeon can do. By presenting the strategies employed by our institution and its surgical unit, which remains the epicenter of the COVID-19 fight in Singapore, together with our medical counterparts, we hope to be able to improve our practices to respond and prevent the pandemic from escalating further as a collective community of surgeons across the globe. OBSERVATIONS: Contingencies should be in place for prioritization of existing patients, triaging and treatment of suspected patients, infection control, manpower management and novel strategies for inter-disciplinary communications and education in a hospital's surgical unit during a pandemic. Working in a high risk environment with manpower and resource limitations for prolonged periods of time has effect on morale and affects surgeon burn-out. Transparent communication, avenues to address psychological needs of surgeons and leadership by example are key strategies in ensuring a sustainable fight against the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: With the varies strategies implemented, every surgical discipline and every surgeon should be unified and place their desire to operate aside. There should not be any differentiation between surgeon and physician, but instead, everyone has to work together as one united health care front battling the common enemy - COVID-19.","Rasappan, Kumaran; Oh, Jacob Yoong Leong; Ding, Benjamin Tze Keong; Mohd Fadhil, Muhd Farhan; Lee, Keng Thiam",Int J Surg,661,1

Aim: To describe trends of antimicrobial consumption in two PICUs before and during the COVID pandemic year. Methods: We did a retrospective study in children admitted in two PICUs of Rio de Janeiro city, between March 2019 and March 2021. The first year represented the pre-pandemic period and the last one the pandemic period. Trends of antimicrobial consumption were measured by days of therapy (DOT/1000 patient-days) and analyzed by linear regression for antibiotics, antivirals and antifungals Results: Number of patients-days in the PICU 1 was 3495 in the pre-pandemic period and 3600 in the pandemic period. The overall DOT/1000 PD of antibiotics, antivirals and antifungal was 15,308.1, 942.8 and 1,691.1, respectively in the pre-pandemic period and 13,481.5, 1,335.4 and 1,243.7, respectively in pandemic period. It was verified trend of reduction of antibiotic and antifungals and increase in antivirals consumption. Number of patients-days in the PICU 2 was 5029 in the pre-pandemic period and 4557 in the pandemic period and the overall DOT/1000 PD of antibiotics, antivirals and antifungal was 16,668.5, 1,385 and 1,966.7, respectively in the pre-pandemic period and 10,896.5, 830.7 and 677.3 in pandemic period.

At some point after demonstration of substantial efficacy, placebo recipients should be offered the efficacious vaccine from their trial, which will occur before longer-term efficacy and safety are known. The absence of a placebo group could compromise assessment of longer-term vaccine effects. However, by continuing follow-up after vaccination of the placebo group, this study shows that placebo-controlled vaccine efficacy can be mathematically derived by assuming that the benefit of vaccination over time has the same profile for the original vaccine recipients and the original placebo recipients after their vaccination. Although this derivation provides less precise estimates than would be obtained by a standard trial where the placebo group remains unvaccinated, this proposed approach allows estimation of longer-term effect, including durability of vaccine efficacy and whether the vaccine eventually becomes harmful for some. Deferred vaccination, if done open-label, may lead to riskier behavior in the unblinded original vaccine group, confounding estimates of long-term vaccine efficacy. Hence, deferred vaccination via blinded crossover, where the vaccine group receives placebo and vice versa, would be the preferred way to assess vaccine durability and potential delayed harm. Deferred vaccination allows placebo recipients timely access to the vaccine when it would no longer be proper to maintain them on placebo, yet still allows important insights about immunologic and clinical effectiveness over time.","Follmann, Dean; Fintzi, Jonathan; Fay, Michael P; Janes, Holly E; Baden, Lindsey R; El Sahly, Hana M; Fleming, Thomas R; Mehrotra, Devan V; Carpp, Lindsay N; Juraska, Michal; Benkeser, David; Donnell, Deborah; Fong, Youyi; Han, Shu; Hirsch, Ian; Huang, Ying; Huang, Yunda; Hyrien, Ollivier; Luedtke, Alex; Carone, Marco; Nason, Martha; Vandebosch, An; Zhou, Honghong; Cho, Iksung; Gabriel, Erin; Kublin, James G; Cohen, Myron S; Corey, Lawrence; Gilbert, Peter B; Neuzil, Kathleen M",Ann. intern. med,661,1

Despite the knowledge of previous coronaviruses, such as those responsible for the SARS and MERS-CoV epidemic, there is no drug or prophylaxis treatment to this day. The rapid succession of scientific findings on SARS-CoV-2 provides a significant number of potential drug targets. Nevertheless, at the same time, the high quantity of clinical data, generated by a large number of rapidly infected people, require accurate tests regarding effective medical treatments. Several in vitro and in vivo studies were rapidly initiated after the outbreak of the pandemic COVID-19. Initial clinical studies revealed the promising potential of remdesivir that demonstrated a powerful and specific in vitro antiviral activity for COVID-19. Promising effects appear to be attributable to hydroxychloroquine. Remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine are being tested in ongoing randomized trials. In contrast, oseltamivir was not effective and corticosteroids are not currently recommended. However, few data from ongoing clinical trials are identifying low molecular weight heparins, innate immune system stimulating agents, and inflammatory modulating agents as potential effective agents. The authors assume that the current pandemic will determine the need for a systematic approach based on big data analysis for identifying effective drugs to defeat SARS-Cov-2. This work is aimed to be a general reference point and to provide an overview as comprehensive as possible regarding the main clinical trials in progress at the moment.","Nittari, Giulio; Pallotta, Graziano; Amenta, Francesco; Tayebati, Seyed Khosrow",Eur J Pharmacol,661,16

Early clinical experiences have demonstrated the wide spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 presentations, including various reports of atypical presentations of COVID-19 and possible mimic conditions.This article summarises the current evidence surrounding atypical presentations of COVID-19 including neurological, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, otorhinolaryngology and geriatric features. A case from our hospital of pneumocystis pneumonia initially suspected to be COVID-19 forms the basis for a discussion surrounding mimic conditions of COVID-19. The dual-process model of clinical reasoning is used to analyse the thought processes used to make a diagnosis of COVID-19, including consideration of the variety of differential diagnoses.While SARS-CoV-2 is likely to remain on the differential diagnostic list for a plethora of presentations for the foreseeable future, clinicians should be cautious of ignoring other potential diagnoses due to availability bias. An awareness of atypical presentations allows SARS-CoV-2 to be a differential so that it can be appropriately investigated. A knowledge of infectious mimics prevents COVID-19 from overshadowing other diagnoses, hence preventing delayed diagnosis or even misdiagnosis and consequent adverse outcomes for patients.","Coleman, Jamie J; Manavi, Kaveh; Marson, Ella J; Botkai, Adam H; Sapey, Elizabeth",Postgrad Med J,661,3

METHODS: A 29-question anonymous online survey was sent by e-mail to members of the Italian Association of Medical Oncology and the Italian Breast Cancer Study Group on April 3, 2020. Only medical oncologists (both those in training and specialists) were invited to complete the questionnaire. RESULTS: Out of 165 responding oncologists, 121 (73.3.%) worked in breast units. In the (neo)adjuvant setting, compared with before the emergency, fewer oncologists adopted weekly paclitaxel (68.5% v 93.9%) and a dose-dense schedule for anthracycline-based chemotherapy (43% v 58.8%) during the COVID-19 outbreak. In the metastatic setting, compared with before the emergency, fewer oncologists adopted first-line weekly paclitaxel for HER2-positive disease (41.8% v 53.9%) or CDK4/6 inhibitors for luminal tumors with less-aggressive characteristics (55.8% v 80.0%) during the COVID-19 outbreak. A significant change was also observed in delaying the timing for monitoring therapy with CDK4/6 inhibitors, assessing treatment response with imaging tests, and flushing central venous devices. Clinical research and scientific activities were reduced in 80.3% and 80.1% of respondents previously implicated in these activities, respectively. CONCLUSION: Medical oncologists face many challenges in providing cancer care during the COVID-19 outbreak. Although most of the changes in their attitudes and practice were reasonable responses to the current health care emergency without expected major negative impact on patient outcomes, some potentially alarming signals of undertreatment were observed.","Poggio, Francesca; Tagliamento, Marco; Di Maio, Massimo; Martelli, Valentino; De Maria, Andrea; Barisione, Emanuela; Grosso, Marco; Boccardo, Francesco; Pronzato, Paolo; Del Mastro, Lucia; Lambertini, Matteo",JCO Oncol Pract,661,24

The lack of in-person interviews will create challenges in assessing applicants, and we recommend that programs develop structured and targeted questions and even consider having candidates answer standardized questions prior to the virtual interview day. From an applicant perspective, gauging the intangibles of individual residency programs, such as resident camaraderie, program culture, and program location, will be difficult. To address this, programs should consider hosting informal virtual gatherings, create videos that highlight the resident experience, and ensure that program websites are up-to-date. Ultimately, adaptability, resilience, and innovation will allow residency programs to achieve a successful 2021 otolaryngology match.","Chou, David W; Pletcher, Steven D; Bruss, David; Sung, C Kwang; Diaz, Rodney C; Liang, Jonathan; Durr, Megan L",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,661,20

However, there are still no approved monoclonal antibody drugs targeting MUC1. In this study, we generated a humanized MUC1 (HzMUC1) antibody from our previously developed MUC1 mouse monoclonal antibody that only recognizes MUC1 on the surface of tumor cells. Furthermore, an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) was generated by conjugating HzMUC1 with monomethyl auristatin (MMAE), and the efficacy of HzMUC1-MMAE on the MUC1-positive HER2+ breast cancer in vitro and in 'Xenograft' model was tested. Results from western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation revealed that the HzMUC1 antibody did not recognize cell-free MUC1-N in sera from breast cancer patients. Confocal microscopy analysis showed that HzMUC1 antibody bound to MUC1 on the surface of breast cancer cells. Results from mapping experiments suggested that HzMUC1 may recognize an epitope present in the interaction region between MUC1-N and MUC1-C. Results from colony formation assay and flow cytometry demonstrated that HzMUC1-MMAE significantly inhibited cell growth by inducing G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in trastuzumab-resistant HER2-positive breast cancer cells. Meanwhile, HzMUC1-MMAE significantly reduced the growth of HCC1954 xenograft tumors by inhibiting cell proliferation and enhancing cell death. In conclusion, our results indicate that HzMUC1-ADC is a novel therapeutic drug that can overcome trastuzumab resistance of breast cancer. HzMUC1-ADC should also be an effective therapeutic drug for the treatment of different MUC1-positive cancers in clinic.","Wu, Guang; Li, Lan; Qiu, Yuxin; Sun, Wei; Ren, Tianhao; Lv, Yingshuai; Liu, Mengnan; Wang, Xiaoxia; Tao, Hongqun; Zhao, Lingjie; Cao, Jiawei; He, Licai; Li, Hongzhi; Gu, Haihua",Acta biochimica et biophysica Sinica,661,16

Genetic association between COVID-19 and various lung disorders must be understood to comprehend the molecular basis of comorbidity and accelerate drug development. METHODS: Lungs tissue-specific neighborhood network of human targets of SARS-CoV-2 was constructed. This network was integrated with lung diseases to build a disease–gene and disease-disease association network. Network-based toolset was used to identify the overlapping disease modules and drug targets. The functional protein modules were identified using community detection algorithms and biological processes, and pathway enrichment analysis. RESULTS: In total, 141 lung diseases were linked to a neighborhood network of SARS-CoV-2 targets, and 59 lung diseases were found to be topologically overlapped with the COVID-19 module. Topological overlap with various lung disorders allows repurposing of drugs used for these disorders to hit the closely associated COVID-19 module. Further analysis showed that functional protein–protein interaction modules in the lungs, substantially hijacked by SARS-CoV-2, are connected to several lung disorders. FDA-approved targets in the hijacked protein modules were identified and that can be hit by exiting drugs to rescue these modules from virus possession. CONCLUSION: Lung diseases are clustered with COVID-19 in the same network vicinity, indicating the potential threat for patients with respiratory diseases after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pathobiological similarities between lung diseases and COVID-19 and clinical evidence suggest that shared molecular features are the probable reason for comorbidity. Network-based drug repurposing approaches can be applied to improve the clinical conditions of COVID-19 patients.

Accurate forecast/mining of the spread process is often hard to be achieved by using statistical or mechanical models. Here we propose a new reverse problem, which aims to identify the stochastically spatial spread process itself from observable information regarding the arrival history of infectious cases in each subpopulation. We solved the problem by developing an efficient optimization algorithm based on dynamical programming, which comprises three procedures: 1) anatomizing the whole spread process among all subpopulations into disjoint componential patches; 2) inferring the most probable invasion pathways underlying each patch via maximum likelihood estimation; and 3) recovering the whole process by assembling the invasion pathways in each patch iteratively, without burdens in parameter calibrations and computer simulations. Based on the entropy theory, we introduced an identifiability measure to assess the difficulty level that an invasion pathway can be identified.

The management of the disease was done at home with methylprednisolone (MP) pulse therapy for three days. This resulted in a favorable evolution and resolution of most symptoms. COVID-19 infection presents as asymptomatic disease, non-severe symptomatic disease, and severe respiratory inflammatory disease. The first two forms are dependent on viral response and a “cytokine storm” is responsible for the progression into severe disease. Glucocorticoids (GC) reduce inflammation by different mechanism depending of their concentration. Pulses lead to overall apoptosis of immune cells. Studies using pulse MP as treatment for SARS-CoV-1 showed clinical improvement and decreased incidence of ARDS compared with patients who received low dose steroid treatment. Inhibition of excessive inflammation through timely administration of GC in the early stage of inflammatory cytokine storm effectively prevents the occurrence of ARDS.","Sauñe, Patricia Merab; Bryce-Alberti, Mayte; Portmann-Baracco, Arianna Sibila; Accinelli, Roberto Alfonso",Respir Med Case Rep,661,21

The prolonged inactivity impact, and lack of in-person interactions among teammates-coaches, could negatively affect athletes. Total of 1508 self-selected Italian athletes, 338 children (aged 10.52 ± 1.31), 499 adolescents (aged 14.17 ± 1.13), and 671 adults (aged 27.59 ± 10.73), completed the Impact of Event Scale (IES-8, IES-15, and IES-R, respectively). Differences by gender, type of sport (individual vs. team), and competitive level (elite vs. amateur) were examined. One-way ANOVAs showed, in adults, significant differences between genders for perceived stress impact total score (TS; p = 0.017) and avoidance behavior, with higher scores in women (p = 0.045). Between individual and team sport, significant differences were found in TS (p = 0.038) and hyperarousal (p = 0.030), with higher results in individual. Adult elite athletes showed significantly higher scores in hyperarousal (p = 0.020) than amateurs. Significant differences were found between gender in adolescents for avoidance (p = 0.011), and between competitive levels in children, for intrusion (p = 0.020). These evidences may raise awareness on distress effects of COVID-19 lockdown among athletes and suggested applying specific well-being protocols during the activity resumption, considering gender, type of sport, and competitive level.","di Cagno, Alessandra; Buonsenso, Andrea; Baralla, Francesca; Grazioli, Elisa; Di Martino, Giulia; Lecce, Edoardo; Calcagno, Giuseppe; Fiorilli, Giovanni",Int J Environ Res Public Health,661,20

We aimed to evaluate the accuracy of blood leucocyte count alone or in combination with LUS for COVID-19 diagnosis. We retrospectively enrolled consecutive patients diagnosed with community acquired pneumonia (CAP) at hospital admission to derive and validate cutoff values for blood cell count that could be predictive of COVID-19 before confirmation by the nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT). Cutoff values, generated and confirmed in inception (41/115, positive/negative patients) and validation (100/180, positive/negative patients) cohorts, were ≤17 and ≤10 cells/mm(3) for basophils and eosinophils, respectively. Basophils and/or eosinophils below cutoff were associated with sensitivity of 98% (95%CI, 94–100) and negative likelihood ratio of 0.04 (95%CI, 0.01–0.11). In a subgroup of 265 subjects, the sensitivity of B-line on LUS was 15% lower (p < 0.001) than that of basophils and/or eosinophils below cutoff. The combination of B-lines with basophils and eosinophils below cutoff was associated with a moderate increase of the positive likelihood ratio: 5.0 (95%CI, 3.2–7.7). In conclusion, basophil and eosinophil counts above the generated cutoff virtually rule out COVID-19 in patients with CAP. Our findings can help optimize patient triage pending the NAAT results.","Biolo, Gianni; Fiotti, Nicola; Cominotto, Franco; Di Girolamo, Filippo Giorgio; Panizon, Emiliano; Altamura, Nicola; Casarsa, Chiara; Pipoli, Alessandro; Giordano, Mauro; Torelli, Lucio; Mearelli, Filippo; Vinci, Pierandrea",J Clin Med,661,24

Using a unique panel dataset of property-level water usage in Henderson, Nevada, we analyze changes in water usage from the SAH order, finding an initial and continuous decline in average daily usage for commercial and school users. In contrast, we find an initial increase in consumption by residential users with this effect increasing over time.

METHODS: Data were collected from Our World in Data. Regression analysis was conducted to adjust for potential confounding factors such as economic activity (GDP), the rate of COVID-19 testing, and the stringency of COVID-19 control policies. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant negative association between smoking prevalence and the prevalence of COVID-19 across the 38 European nations after controlling for confounding factors (p = 0.001). A strong association was found between the prevalence of COVID-19 per million people and economic activity (p = 0.002) and the rate of COVID-19 testing (p = 0.0006). Nations with stricter policy enactment showed fewer COVID-19 cases per million people, but the association was not significant (p = 0.122). Delaying policy enactment was associated with a greater prevalence of COVID-19 (p = 0.0535). Evidence of a direct association between smoking prevalence and COVID-19 mortality was not found (p = 0.626). There was a strong positive association between COVID-19 mortality rate and the prevalence of COVID-19 cases (p < 0.0001) as well as the proportion of the population over 65 years of age (p = 0.0034) and a negative association with the rate of COVID-19 testing (p = 0.0023).

Measures of quality and barriers for rapid use by patients and physicians are not well described. OBJECTIVE: To describe results from a quality improvement initiative during rapid adoptive phase of telemedicine during the pandemic. DESIGN: Patient and physician satisfaction with synchronous audiovisual telemedicine visits was measured during early adoptive phase (April 6‐17, 2020) within the division of sports medicine in an academic Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM&R) department. Patients were invited to participate in a quality improvement initiative by completing an online survey at the end of a telemedicine visit. Physicians completed a separate survey. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient measures included visit type, duration of encounter, quality, and satisfaction. Physicians reported on experiences performing telemedicine. RESULTS: Surveys were completed by 119 patients (289 telemedicine encounters, response rate 41%) and 13 physiatrists. Telemedicine was utilized primarily for follow‐up visits (n=74, 70.6%) and most common duration was 15‐29 minutes. Patients rated their telemedicine visit as “excellent” or “very good” across measures (91.6‐95.0%) including addressing concerns, communication, developing a treatment plan, convenience, and satisfaction. Value of completing a future telemedicine visit was measured at 84.9%. Most reported estimated travel time saved in excess of 30 minutes. Rate of no‐show was 2.8%. Most physicians (62%) had no prior experience with telemedicine visits, and most were comfortable performing these visits after completing 1‐4 sessions (69%). Nearly all physicians (92%) rated their telemedicine experience as very good or excellent. The key barrier identified for telemedicine was technical issues. All physicians reported plans to perform telemedicine visits if reimbursement continues. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, rapid expansion of telemedicine during COVID‐19 pandemic was well‐received by a majority of patients and physicians. This suggests feasibility in rapid expansion of telemedicine for other outpatient sports medicine practices. This article is protected by copyright.

This study aimed to assess the proportions of ever and/or current infection in this population. Methods: A cross-sectional population-based survey was conducted during July 26-September 09, 2020 to assess both anti-SARS-CoV-2 positivity through serological testing and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positivity through PCR testing. Associations with antibody and PCR positivity were identified through regression analyses. Results: Study included 2,641 participants, 69.3% of whom were <40 years of age. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 positivity was estimated at 55.3% (95% CI: 53.3-57.3%) and was significantly associated with nationality, geographic location, educational attainment, occupation, presence of symptoms in the two weeks preceding the survey, and previous infection diagnosis. PCR positivity was assessed at 11.3% (95% CI: 9.9-12.8%) and was significantly associated with geographic location, contact with an infected person, and reporting two or more symptoms. Infection positivity (antibody and/or PCR positive) was assessed at 60.6% (95% CI: 9.9-12.8%). The proportion of antibody-positive CMWs that had a prior SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis was 9.3% (95% CI: 7.9-11.0%). Only seven infections were ever severe and one was ever critical - an infection severity rate of 0.5% (95% CI: 0.2-1.0%). Conclusions: Six in every 10 CMWs have been infected, suggestive of reaching the herd immunity threshold. Infection severity was low with only one in every 200 infections progressing to be severe or critical. Only one in every 10 infections had been previously diagnosed suggestive of mostly asymptomatic or minimally mild infections.","Al-Thani, M. H.; Farag, E.; Bertollini, R.; Al Romaihi, H.

Interferon lambda-1 is a type III interferon involved in innate antiviral responses with activity against respiratory pathogens. We aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of peginterferon lambda in the treatment of outpatients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, outpatients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were randomly assigned to a single subcutaneous injection of peginterferon lambda 180 μg or placebo within 7 days of symptom onset or first positive swab if asymptomatic. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) using a computer-generated randomisation list created with a randomisation schedule in blocks of four. At the time of administration, study nurses received a sealed opaque envelope with the treatment allocation number. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who were negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA on day 7 after the injection, analysed by a χ(2) test following an intention-to-treat principle. Prespecified analysis of the primary endpoint, adjusted for baseline viral load, using bivariate logistic regression was done. The trial is now complete. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04354259. FINDINGS: Between May 18, and Sept 4, 2020, we recruited 30 patients per group. The decline in SARS-CoV-2 RNA was greater in those treated with peginterferon lambda than placebo from day 3 onwards, with a difference of 2·42 log copies per mL at day 7 (p=0·0041). By day 7, 24 (80%) participants in the peginterferon lambda group had an undetectable viral load, compared with 19 (63%) in the placebo group (p=0·15). After controlling for baseline viral load, patients in the peginterferon lambda group were more likely to have undetectable virus by day 7 than were those in the placebo group (odds ratio [OR] 4·12 [95% CI 1·15–16·73; p=0·029). Of those with baseline viral load above 10(6) copies per mL, 15 (79%) of 19 patients in the peginterferon lambda group had undetectable virus on day 7, compared with six (38%) of 16 in the placebo group (OR 6·25 [95% CI 1·49–31·06]; p=0·012). Peginterferon lambda was well tolerated, and adverse events were similar between groups with mild and transient aminotransferase, concentration increases more frequently observed in the peginterferon lambda group. Two individuals met the threshold of grade 3 increase, one in each group, and no other grade 3 or 4 laboratory adverse events were reported. INTERPRETATION: Peginterferon lambda accelerated viral decline in outpatients with COVID-19, increasing the proportion of patients with viral clearance by day 7, particularly in those with high baseline viral load. Peginterferon lambda has potential to prevent clinical deterioration and shorten duration of viral shedding.

Many researchers around the world incorporated various prediction techniques such as Susceptible–Infected–Recovered model, Susceptible–Exposed–Infected–Recovered model, and Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average model (ARIMA) to forecast the spread of this pandemic. The ARIMA technique was not heavily used in forecasting COVID-19 by researchers due to the claim that it is not suitable for use in complex and dynamic contexts. The aim of this study is to test how accurate the ARIMA best-fit model predictions were with the actual values reported after the entire time of the prediction had elapsed. We investigate and validate the accuracy of an ARIMA model over a relatively long period of time using Kuwait as a case study. We started by optimizing the parameters of our model to find a best-fit through examining auto-correlation function and partial auto correlation function charts, as well as different accuracy measures. We then used the best-fit model to forecast confirmed and recovered cases of COVID-19 throughout the different phases of Kuwait’s gradual preventive plan. The results show that despite the dynamic nature of the disease and constant revisions made by the Kuwaiti government, the actual values for most of the time period observed were well within bounds of our selected ARIMA model prediction at 95% confidence interval. Pearson’s correlation coefficient for the forecast points with the actual recorded data was found to be 0.996. This indicates that the two sets are highly correlated. The accuracy of the prediction provided by our ARIMA model is both appropriate and satisfactory.","Alabdulrazzaq, Haneen; Alenezi, Mohammed N.; Rawajfih, Yasmeen; Alghannam, Bareeq A.; Al-Hassan, Abeer A.; Al-Anzi, Fawaz S.",Results Phys,661,24

The factors that influence disease severity should be of clinical concern. Existing findings on the effects of smoking on COVID-19 are also controversial and need to be confirmed by further research. In addition, the effects of alcohol consumption and betel quid (BQ) chewing on COVID-19 are unclear. The aim of this study was to examine the demographic characteristics of COVID-19 patients and the effects of smoking, drinking, BQ chewing, and underlying diseases on the severity of COVID-19. A retrospective study was conducted on 91 patients with confirmed cases of COVID-19 hospitalized in Yueyang, Hunan Province, China from 21 January to 8 March, 2020. Patient demographic data, and information on smoking, drinking and BQ chewing, and underlying diseases were extracted from the patient electronic medical records (EMR) and telephone interviews. The chi-square test was used to conduct a univariate analysis of the factors influencing the severity of COVID-19, and ordinal logistic regression analysis was used to identify the factors related to the severity of COVID-19. The results showed that the rates of smoking, drinking and BQ chewing were 15.4, 26.4, and 7.1%, respectively, there was no significant relationship between these lifestyle factors and the severity of COVID-19 (P > 0.05). However, underlying diseases such as diabetes [odds ratio (OR) = 7.740, 95% confidence interval (CI):1.000–60.740, P = 0.050], source of infection (OR = 0.180, 95% CI: 0.030–0.980, P = 0.049), and employment status (retired/unemployed vs. employed: OR = 29.430, 95% CI, 1.050 – 822.330, P = 0.047) were significant independent predictors of severe COVID-19 infection. These individuals should be informed of methods to increase personal protection, and doctors should prevent these individuals from developing serious diseases. It is important to pay attention to the source of infection and timely medical treatment. This study showed that the clinical classification of COVID-19 was associated with patients with diabetes, source of infection, and retired/unemployed. Therefore in the clinical practice of COVID-19 should be more concern these factors. Although no statistical significance was found in smoking, drinking alcohol, BQ chewing, and severity of COVID-19 patients, more studies have confirmed that are harmful and risk factors for underlying diseases in the population. Health authorities should formulate policies to publicize the harmful effects of smoking, drinking, and betel nut chewing and promote a healthy lifestyle.","Zhong, Rui; Chen, Lingxia; Zhang, Qiong; Li, Binbin; Qiu, Yanfang; Wang, Wei; Tan, Dongyi; Zou, Yanhui",Front Physiol,661,16

We hypothesized that colchicine, by counteracting proinflammatory pathways implicated in the uncontrolled inflammatory response of COVID-19 patients, reduces pulmonary complications, and improves survival. METHODS: This retrospective study included 71 consecutive COVID-19 patients (hospitalized with pneumonia on CT scan or outpatients) who received colchicine and compared with 70 control patients who did not receive colchicine in two serial time periods at the same institution. We used inverse probability of treatment propensity-score weighting to examine differences in mortality, clinical improvement (using a 7-point ordinary scale), and inflammatory markers between the two groups. RESULTS: Amongst the 141 COVID-19 patients (118 [83.7%] hospitalized), 70 (50%) received colchicine. The 21-day crude cumulative mortality was 7.5% in the colchicine group and 28.5% in the control group (P = 0.006; adjusted hazard ratio: 0.24 [95%CI: 0.09 to 0.67]); 21-day clinical improvement occurred in 40.0% of the patients on colchicine and in 26.6% of control patients (adjusted relative improvement rate: 1.80 [95%CI: 1.00 to 3.22]). The strong association between the use of colchicine and reduced mortality was further supported by the diverging linear trends of percent daily change in lymphocyte count (P = 0.018), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (P = 0.003), and in C-reactive protein levels (P = 0.009).

Specific mechanisms recruiting neutrophils to the lung during virus-induced lung inflammation and injury have not been fully elucidated. Since CXCL1 and CXCL2/3, acting through CXCR2, are potent neutrophil chemoattractants, we investigated their role in dsRNA-induced lung injury, where dsRNA (Poly IC) is a well-described synthetic agent mimicking acute viral infection. METHODS: We used 6–8 week old female BALB/c mice to intratracheally inject either single-stranded (ssRNA) or double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) into the airways. The lungs were then harvested at designated timepoints to characterize the elicited chemokine response and resultant lung injury following dsRNA exposure as demonstrated qualititatively by histopathologic analysis, and quantitatively by FACS, protein, and mRNA analysis of BAL fluid and tissue samples. We then repeated the experiments by first pretreating mice with an anti-PMN or corresponding control antibody, and then subsequently pretreating a separate cohort of mice with an anti-CXCR2 or corresponding control antibody prior to dsRNA exposure. RESULTS: Intratracheal dsRNA led to significant increases in neutrophil infiltration and lung injury in BALB/c mice at 72 h following dsRNA, but not in response to ssRNA (Poly C; control) treatment. Expression of CXCR2 ligands and CXCR2 paralleled neutrophil recruitment to the lung. Neutrophil depletion studies significantly reduced neutrophil infiltration and lung injury in response to dsRNA when mice were pretreated with an anti-PMN monoclonal Ab. Furthermore, inhibition of CXCR2 ligands/CXCR2 interaction by pretreating dsRNA-exposed mice with an anti-CXCR2 neutralizing Ab also significantly attenuated neutrophil sequestration and lung injury. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that CXC chemokine ligand/CXCR2 biological axis is critical during the pathogenesis of dsRNA-induced lung injury relevant to acute viral infections.","Londhe, Vedang A; Belperio, John A; Keane, Michael P; Burdick, Marie D; Xue, Ying Ying; Strieter, Robert M",J Inflamm (Lond),661,11

OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical and analytical features of a coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) infected cohort with SCI to enable accurate diagnosis and to outline prevention measures. SETTING: This study was conducted at the National Hospital for Paraplegics (Toledo, Spain). METHODS: A cohort analysis of seven patients with SCI infected by Covid-19 was performed. Diagnosis was confirmed with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of nasal exudate or sputum samples. Clinical, analytical, and radiographic findings were registered. RESULTS: RT-PCR detected COVID-19 infection in all patients, affecting males and people with a cervical level of injury more often (five out of seven). The average delay for diagnostic confirmation was 4 days (interquartile range, 1–10). Fever was the most frequent symptom (six out of seven). The second most common symptom was asthenia (four out of seven), followed by dyspnea, cough, and expectoration (three out of seven for each symptom). The Modified Early Warning System score for Covid-19 severity rating was classified as severe in five out of seven cases. All but one patient showed radiological alterations evident in chest X-rays at the time of diagnosis. All patients recovered gradually. CONCLUSION: Our patients with SCI and Covid-19 infection exhibited fewer symptoms than the general population. Furthermore, they presented similar or greater clinical severity. The clinical evolution was not as pronounced as had been expected. This study recommends close supervision of the SCI population to detect early compatible signs and symptoms of Covid-19 infection.","Rodríguez-Cola, Miguel; Jiménez-Velasco, Irena; Gutiérrez-Henares, Francisco; López-Dolado, Elisa; Gambarrutta-Malfatti, Claudia; Vargas-Baquero, Eduardo; Gil-Agudo, Ángel",Spinal Cord Ser Cases,661,20

Dysregulation of the immune system underlies the pathogenesis of COVID-19, with inflammation mediated local tissue injury to the lung in the setting of suppressed systemic immune function. To define the molecular mechanisms of immune dysfunction in COVID-19 we utilized a systems immunology approach centered on the circulating leukocyte phosphoproteome measured by mass cytometry. COVID-19 is associated with wholesale activation of a broad set of signaling pathways across myeloid and lymphoid cell populations. STAT3 phosphorylation predominated in both monocytes and T cells and was tightly correlated with circulating IL-6 levels. High levels of STAT3 phosphorylation was associated with decreased markers of myeloid cell maturation/activation and decreased ex-vivo T cell IFN-gamma production, demonstrating that during COVID-19 dysregulated cellular activation is associated with suppression of immune effector cell function. Collectively, these data reconcile the systemic inflammatory response and functional immunosuppression induced by COVID-19 and suggest STAT3 signaling may be the central pathophysiologic mechanism driving immune dysfunction in COVID-19.","Turnbull, Isaiah; Fuchs, Anja; Remy, Kenneth; Kelly, Michael; Frazier, Elfaridah; Ghosh, Sarbani; Chang, Shin-wen; Mazer, Monty; Hess, Annie; Leonard, Jennifer; Hoofnagle, Mark; Colonna, Marco; Hotchkiss, Richard",Res Sq,661,24

Given this scenario, the extent of the impact of the disease on more vulnerable individuals, such as pregnant women, is of great concern. Although pregnancy may be a risk factor in respiratory virus infections, there are no considerable differences regarding COVID-19 severity observed between pregnant and nonpregnant women. In these circumstances, an emergent concern is the possibility of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric harm for the offspring of infected mothers. Currently, there is no stronger evidence indicating vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2; however, the exacerbated inflammatory response observed in the disease could lead to several impairments in the offspring's brain. Furthermore, in the face of historical knowledge on possible long-term consequences for the progeny's brain after infection by viruses, we must consider that this might be another deleterious facet of COVID-19.

Digital tools developed before the crisis provided novel aspects of management, and new digital tools were rapidly developed as the crisis progressed. In our institution, a digitally mature NHS Trust in England which builds software systems, development during the early months of the crisis allowed increased patient safety and care, efficient management of the hospital and publication of data. The aim of this paper is to present this experience as a case study, describing development and lessons learned applicable to wider electronic healthcare record development. METHODS: Request, triage, build and test processes for the digital systems were altered in response to the pandemic. Senior Responsible Officers appointed for the emergency triaged all changes and were supported by expert opinion and research active clinicians. Build and test cycles were compressed. New tools were built or existing ones modified in the central Electronic Healthcare Record, PICS (Prescribing, Information and Communication System), Clinical Dashboards and video platforms for remote consultation were developed. FINDINGS: 2236 patients were admitted to UHB with suspected COVID-19 between March and May 2020. Dashboards and visualisation tools enabled by efficient real-time data collection for all new patients, contributed to strategic, operational and clinical decision making. Over 70 urgent changes were made to digital systems, including a screening proforma, improved infection control functions, help and order panels, data dashboards, and updated prescribing features. Novel uses were found for existing functions. INTERPRETATION: Digital tools contributed to a co-ordinated response to COVID-19 in an area with a high disease burden. Change management processes were modified during the pandemic and successfully delivered rapid software modifications and new tools. Principal benefits came from the ability to adapt systems to rapidly changing clinical situations. Lessons learned from this intense development period are widely applicable to EHR development. LAY SUMMARY: Digital tools, which are well designed, can help clinicians and safeguard patients. Health crises such as the COVID pandemic drove rapid development of digital tools. This case study outlines accelerated development within a governance framework that successfully reused existing tools and built new ones. The lessons from this development are generalizable to digital developments in healthcare.","Pankhurst, Tanya; Atia, Jolene; Evison, Felicity; Gallier, Suzy; Lewis, Joshua M; McKee, Deborah; Ryan, Steve; Sapey, Elizabeth; Ball, Simon; Coleman, Jamie J",Health Policy Technol,661,21

This study investigates the capabilities of the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) in observing the spatial and temporal patterns of NO(2) pollution in the continental United States. The unprecedented sensitivity of the sensor can differentiate the fine‐scale spatial heterogeneities in urban areas, such as emissions related to airport/shipping operations and high traffic, and the relatively small emission sources in rural areas, such as power plants and mining operations. We then examine NO(2) columns by day‐of‐the‐week and find that Saturday and Sunday concentrations are 16% and 24% lower respectively, than during weekdays. We also analyze the correlation of daily maximum 2‐m temperatures and NO(2) column amounts and find that NO(2) is larger on the hottest days (>32°C) as compared to warm days (26°C–32°C), which is in contrast to a general decrease in NO(2) with increasing temperature at moderate temperatures. Finally, we demonstrate that a linear regression fit of 2019 annual TROPOMI NO(2) data to annual surface‐level concentrations yields relatively strong correlation (R (2) = 0.66). These new developments make TROPOMI NO(2) satellite data advantageous for policymakers and public health officials, who request information at high spatial resolution and short timescales, in order to assess, devise, and evaluate regulations.","Goldberg, Daniel L.; Anenberg, Susan C.; Kerr, Gaige Hunter; Mohegh, Arash; Lu, Zifeng; Streets, David G.",Earths Future,661,9

With Covid-19, the growth is essentially power-type, especially during the middle stages, and the saturation is currently mostly due to the protective measures. Focusing on these features and the role of epidemic management, we obtain differential equations for the total number of detected cases of Covid-19, which describe the actual curves in many countries almost with the accuracy of physics laws. The two-phase solution we propose worked very well almost for the whole periods of the spread practically in all countries we analyzed that reached the saturation during the first waves. Bessel functions play the key role in our approach. Due to a very small number of parameters, namely, the initial transmission rate and the intensity of the hard and soft measures, we obtain a convincing explanation of the surprising uniformity of the curves of the total numbers of detected infections in many different areas. This theory can serve as a tool for forecasting the epidemic spread and evaluating the efficiency of the protective measures, which is very much needed for epidemics. For instance, the accuracy was very high for the early projection for the 3rd wave in the USA; projections for India, South Africa and UK are considered.","Cherednik, I.",,661,24

The sudden demand led to rapid modification, development, and dissemination of 3D printed PPE. The goal of this study was to determine the inherent sterility and re-sterilizing ability of 3D printed PPE in order to provide sterile equipment to the healthcare field and the general public. METHODS: Samples of polylactic acid (PLA), thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) (infill-based designs) and polypropylene (single-wall hollow design) were 3D printed. Samples were inoculated with E. coli for 24 h and then sanitized using various chemical solutions or heat-based methods. The samples were then incubated for 24- or 72-h in sterile LB medium at 37°C, and bacterial growth was measured by optical density at 600nm. Statistical analysis was conducted using GraphPad Prism v8.2.1. RESULTS: Significant bacterial growth was observed in all PLA and TPU based samples following re-sterilization, regardless of the methods used when compared to controls (p < 0.05). The single-walled hollow polypropylene design was not only sterile following printing, but was also able to undergo re-sanitization following bacterial inoculation, with no significant bacterial growth (p > 0.05) observed regardless of sanitization method used. CONCLUSION: The cost effectiveness, ease of sanitization, and reusability of 3D printed PPE, using our novel single-walled polypropylene design can help meet increased demands of PPE for healthcare workers and the general public that are needed to help decrease the viral transmission of the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. 3D printing also has the potential to lead to the creation and production of other sterile material items for the healthcare industry in the future. The ability to re-sterilize 3D printed PPE, as our design shows, would also contribute less to the increase in biomedical waste (BMW) being experienced by COVID-19.

Social group work is studied as a compulsory discipline for undergraduate students. The major focus of our study was the effectiveness of the learning of Social Work Methods with Groups (SWMG) of students, using workshops in a full-time undergraduate program from Romania. We were interested in finding out the perceptions of students about their learning processes and outcomes in the context of teaching the same discipline exclusively in the online medium, due to the pandemic, and in the face-to-face environment via traditional classroom instruction. This study had a mainly quantitative design, covering two academic years between 2018 and 2020 for the two cohorts of social work students. The core analysis was focused on the activities of students at the SWMG laboratories: 50 students in 2020 and 92 students in 2019. Descriptive, inferential statistics and thematic content analysis were applied to two types of deliverables of students: the self-assessment sheet and the group plan. The results of our study showed that training of cognitive and self-awareness skills prevailed among the students who learned online in 2020, while the acquisition of interpersonal skills was reported at a significantly higher level by students who learned in the face-to-face medium in 2019. The students in the traditional classrooms favoured the training of other professional skills, too, like problem-solving skills. However, students who studied exclusively online attributed a significantly greater overall usefulness of SWMG workshops for professional practise than their peers who participated in the face-to-face laboratories. A remarkable result was that more therapeutic and support groups were preferred in the online environment, maybe related to the concerns generated by the pandemic. Remote education forced most students to return to their original places of residence, mostly in the countryside and brought negative psychological effects caused by social isolation due to the pandemic. Remote learning is not the most desirable educational option.

Nevertheless, some patients may not fully recover to their normal muscle strength, while exposing to potential side effects of these drugs. We report the first case of IIM and axonal peripheral polyneuropathy in a poorly controlled coeliac patient, who made complete recovery with adherence to gluten-free diet. Methods A 76-year-old white Caucasian lady, who was previously independent, presented with 6-weeks history of pain and weakness in both legs. She required the use of a wheelchair to get around as she was unable to weight bear as the result of the pain. She denied any change to regular medications, history of trauma, new rash, joint swelling, or B-symptoms. There was no history of smoking, alcohol, statins, or steroid use. She was previously diagnosed with coeliac disease 10 years ago but had opted not to adhere to a gluten-free diet due to personal preference. Results On examination, there was significant muscle tenderness on palpation of bilateral lower limbs. The rest of systemic examination was unremarkable. Duodenal biopsy revealed severe villous atrophy and chronic lymphocytic and plasma cell inflammation, which reinforced the diagnosis of coeliac disease. All immunology screen including ANA, ENA, ds-DNA, myositis and vasculitis screen were negative except anti-RO-52. This patient did not have any clinical feature of Sjogren’s or systemic lupus erythematosus. EMG revealed fibrillation potentials, positive sharp waves, and myotonic discharges in the paraspinal, upper and lower limbs muscles. It also demonstrated underlying axonal peripheral polyneuropathy. Muscle biopsy showed features consistent with the diagnosis of idiopathic inflammatory myopathy. This patient was started on a gluten-free diet during admission. Interestingly, we discovered that her creatinine kinase level had improved spontaneously along with the clinical improvement of her presenting symptoms. As her symptoms have completely resolved, she was discharged home. She was never started on steroid or immunosuppressant due to her significant clinical improvement. At three-month follow up, her creatinine kinase level had normalised, and she remained in remission while adhering to a gluten-free diet. Conclusion To the best of our knowledge, there is no reported case of complete clinical resolution of IIM with gluten withdrawal in coeliac disease patients, without the need of steroid or immunosuppressants. In addition, the concomitant of myopathy and polyneuropathy, as some described as neuromyositis, is extremely rare. The pathophysiology remains unclear; however, it is proposed that neuropathy could be an extra-muscular manifestation of IIM.The clinical remission of IIM in our patient with adherence to a gluten-free diet provide an alternative treatment option to the current recommended regimes of steroid and immunosuppressants. Such non-pharmacological approach is favourable, especially in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Disclosure Y. Tan: None. A. Mohamedalhadi: None. F.

METHODS: Patients attending a rheumatology outpatient clinic from a tertiary care center in Madrid, Spain, from 1 September 2019 to 29 February 2020 were included. Patients were assigned as exposed or unexposed based on whether they were prescribed with colchicine in their last visit to the clinic during the 6 months before the start of the observation period. Treatment changes during the observation period were also considered. The primary outcome was COVID-19-related hospital admissions between 1 March and 20 May 2020. Secondary outcome included COVID-19-related mortality. Several weighting techniques for data balancing, based and non-based on the propensity score, followed by Cox regressions were performed to estimate the association of colchicine prescription on both outcomes. DISCUSSION: The number of patients entered in the study was 9379, with 406 and 9002 exposed and unexposed follow-up periods, respectively. Generalized Boosted Models (GBMs) and Empirical Balancing Calibration Weighting (EBCW) methods showed the best balance for COVID-19-related hospital admissions. Colchicine prescription did not show a statistically significant association after covariable balancing (p-value = 0.195 and 0.059 for GBM and EBCW, respectively). Regarding mortality, the low number of events prevented a success variable balancing and analysis. CONCLUSION: Colchicine prescription does not play a significant protective or risk role in RMD patients regarding COVID-19-related hospital admissions. Our observations could support the maintenance of colchicine prescription in those patients already being treated, as it is not associated with a worse prognosis.

DESIGN: Budget impact analysis was performed over the following 5 years. Data were primarily from sequencing results on clusters of multidrug-resistant organisms across 27 hospitals. Model inputs were derived from hospitalisation and sequencing data, and epidemiological and costing reports, and included multidrug resistance rates and their trends. SETTING: Queensland, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Hospitalised patients. INTERVENTIONS: WGS surveillance of six common multidrug-resistant organisms (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp and Acinetobacter baumannii) compared with standard of care or routine microbiology testing. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Expected hospital costs, counts of patient infections and colonisations, and deaths from bloodstream infections. RESULTS: In 2021, 97 539 patients in Queensland are expected to be infected or colonised with one of six multidrug-resistant organisms with standard of care testing. WGS surveillance strategy and earlier infection control measures could avoid 36 726 infected or colonised patients and avoid 650 deaths. The total cost under standard of care was $A170.8 million in 2021. WGS surveillance costs an additional $A26.8 million but was offset by fewer costs for cleaning, nursing, personal protective equipment, shorter hospital stays and antimicrobials to produce an overall cost savings of $30.9 million in 2021. Sensitivity analyses showed cost savings remained when input values were varied at 95% confidence limits. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with standard of care, WGS surveillance at a state-wide level could prevent a substantial number of hospital patients infected with multidrug-resistant organisms and related deaths and save healthcare costs. Primary prevention through routine use of WGS is an investment priority for the control of serious hospital-associated infections.","Gordon, Louisa G; Elliott, Thomas M; Forde, Brian; Mitchell, Brett; Russo, Philip L; Paterson, David L; Harris, Patrick N A",BMJ Open,661,21

Because of the complex pathogenesis, high infectivity, and high fatality rate of COVID-19, there are no effective treatments for this epidemic at present. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has a long clinical history in the prevention and treatment of such acute infectious diseases. The therapeutic effect of Lianhua Qingwen (LHQW) on this new coronary pneumonia has attracted the attention of all walks of life, and relevant research reports continue to appear. Here, we intend to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCT) to evaluate the efficacy of LHQW in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We will search each database from the built-in until Dec 2020. The English literature mainly search the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, PubMed, and Web of Science, while the Chinese literature come from CNKI, VIP, Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM), Chinese Science Citation Database (CSCD), and Wan Fang database. Simultaneously, we will retrieve clinical registration tests. This study only screens the RCT of LHQW against COVID-19 and evaluates its efficacy and safety. We will use the Cochrane Handbook to systematically review interventions to assess the risk of bias. The protocol will be reported according to the approach and preferred report items for systematic review and meta-analysis protocols (PRISMA - P). Finally, RevMan software version 5.3 will be used for meta-analysis. RESULTS: The systematic review and meta-analysis aim to review and pool current clinical outcomes of LHQW for treating COVID-19.

Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) is the only WHO-endorsed TB biomarker that can be detected in urine, an easily collected sample matrix. For obtaining optimal sensitivity, we and others have shown that some form of sample pretreatment is necessary to remove background from patient urine samples. A number of systems are paper-based often destined for resource limited settings. Our current work presents incorporation of one such sample pretreatment, proteinase K (ProK) immobilized on paper (IPK) and test its performance in comparison to standard proteinase K (SPK) treatment that involves addition and deactivation at high temperature prior to performing a capture ELISA. Herein, a simple and economical method was developed for using ProK immobilized strips to pretreat urine samples. Simplification and cost reduction of the proposed pretreatment strip were achieved by using Whatman no.1 paper and by minimizing the concentration of ProK (an expensive but necessary reagent) used to pretreat the clinical samples prior to ELISA. To test the applicability of IPK, capture ELISA was carried out on either LAM-spiked urine or the clinical samples after pretreatment with ProK at 400 μg/mL for 30 minutes at room temperature. The optimal conditions and stability of the IPK were tested and validation was performed on a set of 25 previously analyzed archived clinical urine samples with known TB and HIV status. The results of IPK and SPK treated samples were in agreement showing that the urine LAM test currently under development has the potential to reach adult and pediatric patients regardless of HIV status or site of infection, and to facilitate global TB control to improve assay performance and ultimately treatment outcomes.","Panraksa, Yosita; Amin, Anita G.; Graham, Barbara; Henry, Charles S.; Chatterjee, Delphi",PLoS One,661,0

The WHO in 2002 and the Government of India in 2004 recommended low osmolarity rehydration solution (LORS) as the universal rehydration solution for all ages and all forms of dehydration. However, the use of LORS in India continues to be unacceptably low at 51%, although awareness about ORS has increased from a mere 14% in 2005 to 69% in 2015. Availability of different compositions of ORS and brands in market added to the confusion. PROCESS: The Indian Academy of Pediatrics constituted a panel of experts from the fields of pediatrics, pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition to update on management of dehydration in children with particular reference to LORS and issue a current practice guideline. The committee met twice at CIAP HQ to review all published literature on the aspect. Brief presentations were made, followed by discussions. The draft paper was circulated by email. All relevant inputs and suggestions were incorporated to arrive at a consensus on this practice guideline. OBJECTIVES: To summarize latest literature on ORT and empower pediatricians, particularly those practicing in rural areas, on management of dehydration by augmenting LORS use. RECOMMENDATIONS: It was stressed that advantages of LORS far out-weigh its limitations. Increased use of LORS can only be achieved by promoting better awareness among public and health-care providers across all systems of medicine. LORS can also be useful in managing dehydration in non-diarrheal illness. More research is required to modify ORS further to make it safe and effective in neonates, severe acute malnutrition, renal failure, cardiac and other co-morbidities. There is an urgent need to discourage production and marketing all forms of ORS not in conformity with WHO approved LORS, under a slogan “One India, one ORS”.","Mohanty, Nimain; Thapa, Babu Ram; Mathai, John; Pai, Uday; Mohanty, Niranjan; Biradar, Vishnu; Jog, Pramod; Prabhu, Purnima",Indian Pediatr,661,1

To clarify that, we assessed the values of several inflammatory biomarkers and hemocytometry variables in a cohort of obstetric patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 and we correlated the values at admission with the need of oxygen supplementation during the hospitalization. Overall, among 27 (61%) pregnant women and 17 (39%) post-partum women, 6 (14%) patients received oxygen supplementation and 2 (4%) required admission to intensive care unit but none died. During hospitalization neutrophils (p=0.002), neutrophils to lymphocytes ratio (p=0.037) and C reactive protein (p<0.001) decreased significantly, whereas lymphocytes (p<0.001) and platelets (p<0.001) increased. Leukocytes and lymphocytes values at admission were correlated with oxygen need, with respectively a 1% and 5% higher risk of oxygen supplementation for each 1,000 cells decrease. Overall, in obstetric patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019, C reactive protein is the inflammatory biomarker that better mirrors the course of the disease whereas D-dimer or ferritin are not reliable predictors of poor outcome.

There are still uncertainties about the accuracy of estimates of the summary measure of life expectancy, and methods to estimate changes in life expectancy over time are unreliable because of changing patterns of identification. Far too little use is made of the wealth of information that is available, and formal systems for systematically using that information are often vestigial to non-existent. Available information has focussed largely on traditional biomedical topics and too little on access to, expenditure on, and availability of services required to improve health outcomes, and on the underpinning issues of social and emotional wellbeing. It is of concern that statistical artefacts may have been misrepresented as indicating real progress in key health indices. Challenges and opportunities for the future include improving the accuracy of estimation of life expectancy, provision of community level data, information on the availability and effectiveness of health services, measurement of the underpinning issues of racism, culture and social and emotional wellbeing (SEWB), enhancing the interoperability of data systems, and capacity building and mechanisms for Indigenous data governance.

We used a branching process model to derive the final size distribution of minor outbreaks, assuming a reproduction number above unity, and applying the method to final size data for pneumonic plague. Pneumonic plague is a rare disease with only one documented major epidemic in a spatially limited setting. Because the final size distribution of a minor outbreak needs to be normalized by the probability of extinction, we assume that the dispersion parameter (k) of the negative-binomial offspring distribution is known, and examine the sensitivity of the reproduction number to variation in dispersion. Assuming a geometric offspring distribution with k = 1, the reproduction number was estimated at 1.16 (95% confidence interval: 0.97–1.38). When less dispersed with k = 2, the maximum likelihood estimate of the reproduction number was 1.14. These estimates agreed with those published from transmission network analysis, indicating that the human-to-human transmission potential of the pneumonic plague is not very high. Given only minor outbreaks, transmission potential is not sufficiently assessed by directly counting the number of offspring. Since the absence of a major epidemic does not guarantee a subcritical process, the proposed method allows us to conservatively regard epidemic data from minor outbreaks as supercritical, and yield estimates of threshold values above unity.","Nishiura, Hiroshi; Yan, Ping; Sleeman, Candace K.; Mode, Charles J.",Journal of Theoretical Biology,661,1

The third trajectory group (15% of the cohort) that had relatively high MVPA and relatively low SB throughout had lower FMI (−1.7, 95% CI (−3.4 to −1.0) kg/m(2), p = 0.034) at age 15 compared to the inactive throughout group.

In all efforts, data is crucial. Fundamentally, and in the possible absence of a vaccine for 12 to 18 months, we need universal, well-documented testing for both the presence of the disease as well as confirmed recovery through serological tests for antibodies, and we need to track major socioeconomic indices. But we also need auxiliary data of all kinds, including data related to how populations are talking about the unfolding pandemic through news and stories. To in part help on the social media side, we curate a set of 2000 day-scale time series of 1- and 2-grams across 24 languages on Twitter that are most ‘important’ for April 2020 with respect to April 2019. We determine importance through our allotaxonometric instrument, rank-turbulence divergence. We make some basic observations about some of the time series, including a comparison to numbers of confirmed deaths due to COVID-19 over time. We broadly observe across all languages a peak for the language-specific word for ‘virus’ in January 2020 followed by a decline through February and then a surge through March and April. The world’s collective attention dropped away while the virus spread out from China. We host the time series on Gitlab, updating them on a daily basis while relevant. Our main intent is for other researchers to use these time series to enhance whatever analyses that may be of use during the pandemic as well as for retrospective investigations.","Alshaabi, Thayer; Arnold, Michael V.; Minot, Joshua R.; Adams, Jane Lydia; Dewhurst, David Rushing; Reagan, Andrew J.; Muhamad, Roby; Danforth, Christopher M.; Dodds, Peter Sheridan",PLoS One,661,1

It is essential to detect the disease quickly and immediately to isolate the infected individuals. Nevertheless, the current widely used PCR and immunoassay-based methods suffer from false negative results and delays in diagnosis. Herein, a high-throughput serum peptidome profiling method based on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) is developed for efficient detection of COVID-19. We analyzed the serum samples from 146 COVID-19 patients and 152 control cases (including 73 non-COVID-19 patients with similar clinical symptoms, 33 tuberculosis patients, and 46 healthy individuals). After MS data processing and feature selection, eight machine learning methods were used to build classification models. A logistic regression machine learning model with 25 feature peaks achieved the highest accuracy (99%), with sensitivity of 98% and specificity of 100%, for the detection of COVID-19.

Phenotypically, from fishes to amphibians to reptiles, the emergence of limbs greatly facilitates the landing of ancient vertebrates, but the causal mutations and evolutionary trajectory of this process remain unclear. RESULTS: We serendipitously obtained a pig of limbless phenotype. Mutations specific to this handicapped pig were identified using genome re-sequencing and comparative genomic analysis. We narrowed down the causal mutations to particular chromosomes and even several candidate genes and sites, such like a mutation-containing codon in gene BMP7 (bone morphogenetic protein) which was conserved in mammals but variable in lower vertebrates. CONCLUSIONS: We parsed the limbless-related mutations in the light of evolution. The limbless pig shows phenocopy of the clades before legs were evolved. Our findings might help deduce the emergence of limbs during vertebrate evolution and should be appealing to the broad community of human genetics and evolutionary biology.

To the best of our knowledge, no systematic review with meta-analysis and a sub-group comparison between severe and non-severe cases has been published. The aim of this study is to assess the frequency of neurological manifestations and complications, identify the neurodiagnostic findings, and compare these aspects between severe and non-severe COVID-19 cases. METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, EBSCO, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases was conducted for studies published between the 1st of January 2020 and 22nd of April 2020. In addition, we scanned the bibliography of included studies to identify other potentially eligible studies. The criteria for eligibility included studies published in English language (or translated to English), those involving patients with COVID-19 of all age groups, and reporting neurological findings. Data were extracted from eligible studies. Meta-analyses were conducted using comprehensive meta-analysis software. Random-effects model was used to calculate the pooled percentages and means with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the effect of individual studies on the summary estimate. A subgroup analysis was conducted according to severity. The main outcomes of the study were to identify the frequency and nature of neurological manifestations and complications, and the neuro-diagnostic findings in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: 44 articles were included with a pooled sample size of 13,480 patients. The mean age was 50.3 years and 53% were males. The most common neurological manifestations were: Myalgia (22.2, 95% CI, 17.2 to 28.1%), taste impairment (19.6, 95% CI, 3.8 to 60.1%), smell impairment (18.3, 95% CI, 15.4 to 76.2%), headache (12.1, 95% CI, 9.1 to 15.8%), dizziness (11.3, 95% CI, 8.5 to 15.0%), and encephalopathy (9.4, 95% CI, 2.8 to 26.6%). Nearly 2.5% (95% CI, 1 to 6.1%) of patients had acute cerebrovascular diseases (CVD). Myalgia, elevated CK and LDH, and acute CVD were significantly more common in severe cases.

OBJECTIVE: To characterize the prevalence and outcome of COVID-19 in pwMS specifically associated with different DMT in a nationwide population-based study. METHODS: We included patients aged ≥18 years with a confirmed diagnosis of MS and a diagnosis of COVID-19 established between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020. We classified COVID-19 course as either mild, severe or fatal. Impact of DMT and specifically immunosuppressants (alemtuzumab, cladribine, fingolimod, ocrelizumab or rituximab) on COVID-19 outcome was determined by multivariable models, adjusted for a-priori-risk. RESULTS: Of 126 MS patients with COVID-19 (mean age 43.2 years [SD 13.4], 71% female), 86.5% had a mild course, 9.5% a severe course and 3.2% died from COVID-19. A-priori-risk significantly predicted COVID-19 severity (R(2) 0.814; p<0.001) and mortality (R(2) 0.664; p<0.001). Adjusting for this a-priori-risk, neither exposure to any DMT nor exposure to specific immunosuppressive DMT were significantly associated with COVID-19 severity (odds ratio [OR] 1.6; p = 0.667 and OR 1.9; p = 0.426) or mortality (OR 0.5; p = 0.711 and 2.1; 0.233) when compared to no DMT. CONCLUSIONS: In a population-based MS cohort, COVID-19 outcome was not associated with exposure to DMT and immunosuppressive DMT when accounting for other already known risk factors. This provides reassuring evidence that COVID-19 risk can be individually anticipated in MS and–except for a very small proportion of high-risk patients–treatment decisions should be primarily focused on treating MS rather than the pandemic.","Bsteh, Gabriel; Assar, Hamid; Hegen, Harald; Heschl, Bettina; Leutmezer, Fritz; Di Pauli, Franziska; Gradl, Christiane; Traxler, Gerhard; Zulehner, Gudrun; Rommer, Paulus; Wipfler, Peter; Guger, Michael; Enzinger, Christian; Berger, Thomas",PLoS One,661,16

Although an infectious cause was suspected to account for the disease, no conclusive diagnosis had been reached with respect to conventional infectious agents. Extensive laboratory diagnostic investigation on suspect cases repeatedly resulted in the isolation of a cytopathic enveloped virus of 50–60 nm in size from nervous and second lymphoid tissues and sera and, to reflect its unknown identity, named “Virus X”. The presence of virus particle with morphological characteristics similar to Virus X in tissues from affected animals was also observed on thin-section positive-staining electron microscopy. Isolates of Virus X were not readily recognized by antibodies raised against any known viruses pathogenic to swine but by antisera collected from animals surviving clinical episode, indicating that Virus X is likely a previously unrecognized agent. Pregnant sows experimentally inoculated with Virus X (ISUYP604671) or homogenate (filtrate) of tissues from a clinically affected animal developed clinical signs and pathological changes similar to field observations including the loss of pregnancy. Furthermore, caesarian-derived, colostrum-deprived young pigs developed mild encephalomyelitis lesions in brains after experimental inoculation with the virus or the tissue homogenate although clinical neurologic signs were not observed. More importantly, Virus X was re-isolated from all inoculated animals while control pigs remained negative for the virus during the study. Collectively, Virus X is a novel viral agent responsible for PRNS and remains to be further characterized for taxonomical identity.","Pogranichniy, Roman M.; Schwartz, Kent J.; Yoon, Kyoung-Jin",Vet Microbiol,661,16

Our aim is to assess whether patients receiving chronic statin treatment who are hospitalized with COVID-19 have reduced in-hospital mortality if statin therapy is maintained during hospitalization. METHODS: This work is a cross-sectional, observational, retrospective multicenter study that analyzed 2921 patients who required hospital admission at 150 Spanish centers included in the nationwide SEMI-COVID-19 Network. We compared the clinical characteristics and COVID-19 disease outcomes between patients receiving chronic statin therapy who maintained this therapy during hospitalization versus those who did not. Propensity score matching was used to match each statin user whose therapy was maintained during hospitalization to a statin user whose therapy was withdrawn during hospitalization. RESULTS: After propensity score matching, continuation of statin therapy was associated with lower all-cause mortality (OR 0.67, 0.54–0.83, p < 0.001); lower incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) (OR 0.76,0.6–0.97, p = 0.025), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (OR 0.78, 0.69- 0.89, p < 0.001), and sepsis (4.82% vs 9.85%, p = 0.008); and less need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) (5.35% vs 8.57, p < 0.001) compared to patients whose statin therapy was withdrawn during hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Patients previously treated with statins who are hospitalized for COVID-19 and maintain statin therapy during hospitalization have a lower mortality rate than those in whom therapy is withdrawn.

However, the continuous flow pattern in FCV during inspiration and expiration has a significant impact on respiratory parameters and ventilatory settings compared to conventional ventilation modes. In addition, the constant flow combined with direct intratracheal pressure measurement allows determination of dynamic compliance and ventilation settings can be adjusted accordingly, reflecting a personalized ventilation approach. CASE PRESENTATION: A 50-year old women with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection suffering from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was admitted to a tertiary medical center. Initial ventilation occurred with best standard of care pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) and was then switched to FCV, by adopting PCV ventilator settings. This led to an increase in oxygenation by 30 %. Subsequently, to reduce invasiveness of mechanical ventilation, FCV was individualized by dynamic compliance guided adjustment of both, positive end-expiratory pressure and peak pressure; this intervention reduced driving pressure from 18 to 12 cm H(2)O. However, after several hours, compliance further deteriorated which resulted in a tidal volume of only 4.7 ml/kg. CONCLUSIONS: An individualized FCV approach increased oxygenation parameters in a patient suffering from severe COVID-19 related ARDS. Direct intratracheal pressure measurements allow for determination of dynamic compliance and thus optimization of ventilator settings, thereby reducing applied and dissipated energy. However, although desirable, this personalized ventilation strategy may reach its limits when lung function is so severely impaired that patient’s oxygenation has to be ensured at the expense of lung protective ventilation concepts.","Spraider, Patrick; Putzer, Gabriel; Breitkopf, Robert; Abram, Julia; Mathis, Simon; Glodny, Bernhard; Martini, Judith",BMC Anesthesiol,661,1

This is especially a problem for emerging pathogens that are newly introduced into the human population and carry the inherent risk of pandemic spread in a naïve population. For such situations, a considerable number of different platform technologies are under development. These are also under development for pathogens, where directly derived vaccines are regarded as too complicated or even dangerous due to the induction of inefficient or unwanted immune responses causing considerable side-effects as for dengue virus. Among platform technologies are plasmid-based DNA vaccines, RNA replicons, single-round infectious vector particles, or replicating vaccine-based vectors encoding (a) critical antigen(s) of the target pathogens. Among the latter, recombinant measles viruses derived from vaccine strains have been tested. Measles vaccines are among the most effective and safest life-attenuated vaccines known. Therefore, the development of Schwarz-, Moraten-, or AIK-C-strain derived recombinant vaccines against a wide range of mostly viral, but also bacterial pathogens was quite straightforward. These vaccines generally induce powerful humoral and cellular immune responses in appropriate animal models, i.e., transgenic mice or non-human primates.

The degree to which SARS-CoV-2 infection generates T(fh) cells and stimulates the germinal center response is an important question as we investigate vaccine options for the current pandemic. Here we report that, following infection with SARS-CoV-2, adult rhesus macaques exhibited transient accumulation of activated, proliferating T(fh) cells in their peripheral blood on a transitory basis. The CD4 helper cell responses were skewed predominantly toward a T(h)1 response in blood, lung, and lymph nodes, reflective of the interferon-rich cytokine environment following infection. We also observed the generation of germinal center T(fh) cells specific for the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, and a corresponding early appearance of antiviral serum IgG antibodies but delayed or absent IgA antibodies. Our data suggest that a vaccine promoting T(h)1-type T(fh) responses that target the S protein may lead to protective immunity.","Elizaldi, Sonny R.; Lakshmanappa, Yashavanth Shaan; Roh, Jamin W.; Schmidt, Brian A.; Carroll, Timothy D.; Weaver, Kourtney D.; Smith, Justin C.; Deere, Jesse D.; Dutra, Joseph; Stone, Mars; Sammak, Rebecca Lee; Olstad, Katherine J.; Reader, J.

Italy is one of the countries hardest hit by the pandemic, resulting in healthcare facilities bearing heavy burdens and severe restrictive measures. Despite efforts to clarify the virus transmission, especially in indoor scenarios, several aspects of SARS-CoV-2 spread are still rudimentary. This study evaluated the contamination of the air and surfaces by SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the COVID-19 isolation ward of a hospital in Milan, Italy. A total of 42 air and surface samples were collected inside five different zones of the ward including contaminated (COVID-19 patients' area), semi-contaminated (undressing room), and clean areas. SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was performed using real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Overall, 24.3% of swab samples were positive, but none of these were collected in the clean area. Thus, the positivity rate was higher in contaminated (35.0%) and semi-contaminated (50.0%) areas than in clean areas (0.0%; P<0.05). The most contaminated surfaces were hand sanitizer dispensers (100.0%), medical equipment (50.0%), medical equipment touch screens (50.0%), shelves for medical equipment (40.0%), bedrails (33.3%), and door handles (25.0%). All the air samples collected from the contaminated area, namely the intensive care unit and corridor, were positive while viral RNA was not detected in either semi-contaminated or clean areas. These results showed that environmental contamination did not involve clean areas, but the results also support the need for strict disinfection, hand hygiene and protective measures for healthcare workers as well as the need for airborne isolation precautions.","Razzini, Katia; Castrica, Marta; Menchetti, Laura; Maggi, Lorenzo; Negroni, Lucia; Orfeo, Nicola V.; Pizzoccheri, Alice; Stocco, Matteo; Muttini, Stefano; Balzaretti, Claudia M.",Sci Total Environ,661,24

There is an urgent need for the development of new tools for those diseases for which no diagnostics currently exist and for improvement of existing diagnostics for the remaining diseases. Yet, efforts to achieve this, and other crosscutting ambitions, are fragmented, and the burden of these 20 debilitating diseases immense. Compounded by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, programmatic interruptions, systemic weaknesses, limited investment, and poor commercial viability undermine global efforts—with a lack of coordination between partners, leading to the duplication and potential waste of scant resources. Recognizing the pivotal role of diagnostic testing and the ambition of WHO, to move forward, we must create an ecosystem that prioritizes country-level action, collaboration, creativity, and commitment to new levels of visibility.

OBJECTIVE: To characterize and compare the initial clinical and imaging features of COVID-19 in pediatric and adult patients undergoing chest computed tomography (CT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 61 patients, consisting of 47 adults (18 years old or older) and 14 pediatric patients (younger than 18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) between January 25, 2020 and February 15, 2020 were enrolled in this study. All patients underwent chest CT within 3 days after the initial RT-PCR. The clinical presentation, serum markers, and CT findings were assessed and compared between the adult and pediatric patients. RESULTS: Fever was less common in pediatric patients than in adults (6/14, 42.9% vs 39/47, 83%; p = 0.008). Leukopenia or normal, lymphopenia or normal, and increased or normal C-reactive protein were common in both groups with no difference (p > 0.05). Compared with the adults, pediatric patients had a lower rate of positive CT findings and a milder clinical grade (p = 0.004, p = 0.001 respectively). On chest CT, the number of pulmonary lobes involved was reduced in pediatric patients when compared to adults (p = 0.012). Subpleural distribution of lung opacities was a dominant feature in both groups, whereas bronchial distribution was more common in the pediatric group (p = 0.048). Among the CT features in adults, ground-glass opacities (GGO) were the most common finding (24/43, 53.5%), followed by GGO with consolidation (14/43, 27.9%). In pediatric patients, GGOs accounted for 42.9% (3/7), bronchial wall thickening occurred in 28.6% (2/7), and GGOs with consolidations and nodular opacities in 14.3% (1/7). However, these CT features did not differ in two groups, except for bronchial wall thickening, which was more commonly found in pediatric patients (p=0.048). Additionally, the semi-quantitative scores of lung involvement were higher in adults than in pediatric patients (8.89 ± 4.54 vs 1.86 ± 2.41, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to adults, pediatric patients with COVID-19 showed distinctive clinical and CT. Pediatric patients tend to have milder clinical symptoms, fewer positive CTs, and less extensive involvement on imaging. Bronchial wall thickening was relatively more frequent on CT images from pediatric patients with COVID-19 in comparison with adults.","Chen, Amei; Huang, Junxiang; Liao, Yuting; Liu, Zaosong; Chen, Dandan; Yang, Chongzhe; Yang, Ruimeng; Wei, Xinhua",Radiol Cardiothorac Imaging,661,26

To facilitate prospective surveillance for such evolution, we map how convalescent plasma antibodies are impacted by all mutations to the spike’s receptor-binding domain (RBD), the main target of plasma neutralizing activity. Binding by polyclonal plasma antibodies is affected by mutations in three main epitopes in the RBD, but longitudinal samples reveal that the impact of these mutations on antibody binding varies substantially both among individuals and within the same individual over time. Despite this inter- and intra-person heterogeneity, the mutations that most reduce antibody binding usually occur at just a few sites in the RBD’s receptor-binding motif.

Malnutrition has long been associated with poor outcomes among patients with pneumonia. This may be due to the increased risk of malnourished patients to develop impaired muscle and respiratory function. We aimed to determine the outcomes of adult COVID 19 patients admitted in a tertiary government hospital accordingly to nutrition status and risk. Methods Retrospective study on the adult COVID 19 patients admitted from July 15 to September 15, 2020 who were screened using the Philippine Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition modified Subjective Global Assessment Grade tool. Chi-square or Fisher exact test, as well as Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal-Wallis with post-hoc Dunn test, as appropriate were done. Survival analysis for mortality was done with right-censored data length of initial admission in days. Cox proportional hazard regression was done to determine the association of the main variables of interest with mortality with a 95% confidence interval. Results Malnourished patients were 30% less likely to be discharged [HR 0.70 95% CI (0.50, 0.97)]; malnutrition was also associated with length of hospital stay as those who were malnourished had longer lengths of hospital stay of about 4 days on the average [HR 3.55 95% CI (0.83, 6.27)]. High nutrition risk was significantly associated with length of hospital stay [HR 4.36 95% CI (0.89, 7.83)]. Conclusion The only risk factor for mortality shown in this study is ICU transfer. Malnutrition, moderate nutrition risk, and high nutrition risk were risk factors of having longer lengths of hospital stays. While only malnutrition was the risk factor for being less likely to be discharged.

It is either idiopathic, drug-induced or malignancy associated (MASS). MASS is uncommon in cervical cancer, and usually signals diagnosis, progression or recurrence. CLINICAL COURSE: Two months following chemoradiation for stage IIIC2(r) squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the cervix, a 55-year-old female developed painful papules and plaques on her left toes. One week later she developed fever and the rash spread to her body. Labs revealed leukopenia and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Punch biopsy showed neutrophilic dermal inflammation with papillary dermal edema and was negative for infectious immunohistochemistry. The clinical presentation and histopathological features were consistent with, and met diagnostic criteria for Sweet Syndrome. One month following Sweet Syndrome diagnosis and four months following chemoradiation, positron emission tomography scan revealed recurrence in the pelvic lymph nodes.

These span from environmental and intracellular stresses, such as hyperosmolarity, oxidative stress or DNA damage, to physiological situations that involve important cellular changes such as differentiation. Given that p38α controls a plethora of functions, dysregulation of this pathway has been linked to diseases such as inflammation, immune disorders or cancer, suggesting the possibility that targeting p38α could be of therapeutic interest. In this Review, we discuss the organization of this signalling pathway focusing on the diversity of p38α substrates, their mechanisms and their links to particular cellular functions. We then address how the different cellular responses can be generated depending on the signal received and the cell type, and highlight the roles of this kinase in human physiology and in pathological contexts.","Canovas, Begoña; Nebreda, Angel R.",Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol,661,21

An efficient alternative to this grave hazard is the speedy substitution of fossil fuel-based carbon energy sources with the shift to clean sources of renewable energy that cause zero emissions. This needs to happen in conjunction with the continuing increase in the overall consumption of energy worldwide. Many resources of renewable energy are available. These include thermal, solar photovoltaic, biomass and wind, tidal energy, hydropower, and geothermal. Notably, tidal energy exhibits great potential with regard to its dependability, superior energy density, certainty, and durability. The energy mined from the tides on the basis of steady and anticipated vertical movements of the water, causing tidal currents, could be converted into kinetic energy to produce electricity. Tidal barrages could channel mechanical energy, while tidewater river turbines can seize the energy from tidal currents.

Here, we provide a detailed follow-up clinical investigation in a very young female patient (17-year-old) with a long-lasting anosmia after a mild infection, with partial recovery 15 months after the onset. METHODS: Neuroimaging and neurophysiologic assessments as well as olfactory mucosa swabbing for microbiological and immunocytochemical analyses were performed. Olfactory and gustatory evaluations were conducted through validated tests. RESULTS: Chemosensory evaluations were consistent with anosmia associated with parosmia phenomena and gustatory impairment, the latter less persistent. Brain MRI (3.0 T) showed no microvascular injury in olfactory bulbs and brain albeit we cannot rule out slight structural abnormalities during the acute phase, and a high-density EEG was negative. Immunocytochemistry of olfactory mucosa swabs showed high expression of ACE2 in sustentacular cells and lower dot-like cytoplasmic positivity in neuronal-shaped cells. DISCUSSION: The occurrence of long-term persistent olfactory deficit in spite of the absence of structural brain and olfactory bulb involvement supports the view of a possible persistent dysfunction of both sustentacular cells and olfactory neurons. The gustatory dysfunction even if less persisting for the described features could be related to a primary gustatory system involvement. Future longitudinal studies are needed to investigate the persistence of chemosensory impairment, which could have a relevant impact on the daily life.

Control measures, based on isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine, can decrease and delay the burden of the ongoing epidemic. With respect to the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, recent modeling work shows that these interventions may be inadequate to control local outbreaks, even when perfect isolation is assumed. The effect of infectiousness prior to symptom onset combined with asymptomatic infectees further complicates the use of contact tracing. We aim to study whether antivirals, which decrease the viral load and reduce infectiousness, could be integrated into control measures in order to augment the feasibility of controlling the epidemic. METHODS: Using a simulation-based model of viral transmission, we tested the efficacy of different intervention measures to control local COVID-19 outbreaks. For individuals that were identified through contact tracing, we evaluate two procedures: monitoring individuals for symptoms onset and testing of individuals. Additionally, we investigate the implementation of an antiviral compound combined with the contact tracing process. RESULTS: For an infectious disease in which asymptomatic and presymptomatic infections are plausible, an intervention measure based on contact tracing performs better when combined with testing instead of monitoring, provided that the test is able to detect infections during the incubation period. Antiviral drugs, in combination with contact tracing, quarantine, and isolation, result in a significant decrease of the final size and the peak incidence, and increase the probability that the outbreak will fade out. CONCLUSION: In all tested scenarios, the model highlights the benefits of control measures based on the testing of traced individuals. In addition, the administration of an antiviral drug, together with quarantine, isolation, and contact tracing, is shown to decrease the spread of the epidemic. This control measure could be an effective strategy to control local and re-emerging outbreaks of COVID-19.","Torneri, Andrea; Libin, Pieter; Vanderlocht, Joris; Vandamme, Anne-Mieke; Neyts, Johan; Hens, Niel",BMC Med,661,1

For this, we introduce a model that combines an intertemporal framework and a price adjustment process. This model makes it possible to derive a testable relationship between observable macroeconomic variables. Tests carried out on a panel of 19 OECD countries confirm the influence of factors suggested by the theoretical model, in particular, the link between the fall in the interest rate and the economic slowdown. The covid episode is analyzed as a mixed shock of supply and demand. The exit from the covid crisis could be accompanied by a rebound, but rising real interest rates are not the most likely scenario.","Bismut, Claude; Ramajo, Ismaël",Int Econ Econ Policy,661,24

We have used a novel `gene signature'-based drug repositioning strategy by applying widely accepted gene ranking algorithms to prioritize the FDA approved or under trial drugs. We mined publically available RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data using CLC Genomics Workbench 20 (QIAGEN) and identified 283 differentially expressed genes (FDR<0.05, log2FC>1) after a meta-analysis of three independent studies which were based on severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in primary human airway epithelial cells. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) revealed that SARS-CoV-2 activated key canonical pathways and gene networks that intricately regulate general anti-viral as well as specific inflammatory pathways. Drug database, extracted from the Metacore and IPA, identified 15 drug targets (with information on COVID-19 pathogenesis) with 46 existing drugs as potential-novel candidates for repurposing for COVID-19 treatment. We found 35 novel drugs that inhibit targets (ALPL, CXCL8, and IL6) already in clinical trials for COVID-19. Also, we found 6 existing drugs against 4 potential anti-COVID-19 targets (CCL20, CSF3, CXCL1, CXCL10) that might have novel anti-COVID-19 indications. Finally, these drug targets were computationally prioritized based on gene ranking algorithms, which revealed CXCL10 as the common and strongest candidate with 2 existing drugs. Furthermore, the list of 283 SARS-CoV-2-associated proteins could be valuable not only as anti-COVID-19 targets but also useful for COVID-19 biomarker development.","Gupta, R.; Nwachuku, E.; Zusman, B.; Jha, R.; Puccio, A.",,661,16

Sociodemographic, deprivation, clinical and domicile characteristics will be summarised and compared across ethnic subgroups (categorised as per 2011 census). Cox models will be used to calculate HR for hospitalisation and COVID-19 mortality associated with ethnic group. Potential confounding and explanatory factors (such as demographic, socioeconomic and clinical) will be adjusted for within regression models. The percentage contribution of distinct risk factor classes to the excess risks seen in ethnic groups/subgroups will be calculated.

METHODS: Forty departments shared their data on acute and elective thoracic and abdominal aortic procedures between January and May 2020 and January and May 2019 in Europe, Asia and the USA. Admission rates as well as delay from onset of symptoms to referral were compared. RESULTS: No differences in the number of acute thoracic and abdominal aortic procedures were observed between 2020 and the reference period in 2019 [incidence rates ratio (IRR): 0.96, confidence interval (CI) 0.89–1.04; P = 0.39]. Also, no difference in the time interval from acute onset of symptoms to referral was recorded (<12 h 32% vs > 12 h 68% in 2020, < 12 h 34% vs > 12 h 66% in 2019 P = 0.29). Conversely, a decline of 35% in elective procedures was seen (IRR: 0.81, CI 0.76–0.87; P < 0.001) with substantial differences between countries and the most pronounced decline in Italy (−40%, P < 0.001). Interestingly, in Switzerland, an increase in the number of elective cases was observed (+35%, P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: There was no change in the number of acute thoracic and abdominal aortic cases and procedures during the initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas the case load of elective operations and procedures decreased significantly. Patients with acute aortic syndromes presented despite COVID-19 and were managed according to current guidelines. Further analysis is required to prove that deferral of elective cases had no impact on premature mortality.","Czerny, Martin; Gottardi, Roman; Puiu, Paul; Bernecker, Oliver Y; Citro, Rodolfo; Della Corte, Alessandro; di Marco, Luca; Fink, Martina; Gosslau, Yvonne; Haldenwang, Peter Lukas; Heijmen, Robin H; Hugas-Mallorqui, Maria; Iesu, Severino; Jacobsen, Oyvind; Jassar, Arminder S; Juraszek, Andrzej; Kolowca, Maciej; Lepidi, Sandro; Marrocco-Trischitta, Massimiliano M; Matsuda, Hitoshi; Meisenbacher, Katrin; Micari, Antonio; Minatoya, Kenji; Park, Kay-Hyun; Peterss, Sven; Petrich, Michael; Piffaretti, Gabriele; Probst, Chris; Reutersberg, Benedikt; Rosati, Fabrizio; Schachner, Bruno; Schachner, Thomas; Sorokin, Vitali A; Szeberin, Zoltan; Szopinski, Piotr; Di Tommaso, Luigi; Trimarchi, Santi; Verhoeven, Eric L G; Vogt, Ferdinand; Voetsch, Andreas; Walter, Tim; Weiss, Gabriel; Yuan, Xun; Benedetto, Filippo; De Bellis, Antonio; D´ Oria, Mario; Discher, Philipp; Zierer, Andreas; Rylski, Bartosz; van den Berg, Jos C; Wyss, Thomas R; Bossone, Eduardo; Schmidli, Jürg; Nienaber, Christoph; Accarino, Giulio; Baldascino, Francesco; Böckler, Dittmar; Corazzari, Claudio; D´ Alessio, Ilenia; de Beaufort, Hector; De Troia, Christopher; Dumfarth, Julia; Galbiati, Denise; Gorgatti, Filippo; Hagl, Christian; Hamiko, Marwan; Huber, Florian; Hyhlik-Duerr, Alexander; Ianelli, Gabriele; Iesu, Ivana; Jung, Joon-Chui; Kainz, Frieda-Maria; Katsargyris, Athanasios; Koter, Stephan; Kusmierczyk, Mariusz; Kolsut, Piotr; Lengyel, Balazs; Lomazzi, Chiara; Muneretto, Claudio; Nava, Giovanni; Nolte, Thomas; Pacini, Davide; Pleban, Eliza; Rychla, Miriam; Sakamoto, Kazuhisa; Shijo, Takayuki; Yokawa, Koki; Siepe, Matthias; Sirch, Joachim; Strauch, Justus; Sule, Jai Ajitchandra; Tobler, Eva-Luca; Walter, Corinna; Weigang, Ernst",Eur J Cardiothorac Surg,661,17

Previous findings on the effects of retirement on wellbeing have been mixed. The present study explores the effects of employment and retirement on health and wellbeing among a sample of rural Australians. METHODS: Australian Rural Mental Health Study participants who were aged 45 or over (N = 2013) were included in a series of analyses to compare the health and wellbeing of individuals with differing employment and retirement circumstances. Self-reported outcome variables included perceived physical health and everyday functioning, financial wellbeing, mental health, relationships, and satisfaction with life. RESULTS: Across the outcomes, participants who were employed or retired generally reported better health and wellbeing than those not in the workforce. Retired participants rated more highly than employed participants on mental health, relationships, and satisfaction with life. There was also a short-term benefit for perceived financial status for retired participants compared to employed participants, but this effect diminished over time. CONCLUSIONS: While retirement is a significant life transition that may affect multiple facets of an individual’s life, the direction and magnitude of these effects vary depending on the retirement context, namely the pre-retirement and concurrent circumstances within which an individual is retiring. Personal perceptions of status changes may also contribute to an individual’s wellbeing more so than objective factors such as income. Policies that promote rural work/retirement opportunities and diversity and address rural disadvantage are needed.

However, lack of consistency in methods used to monitor antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 leaves some uncertainty in our fine understanding of the human antibody response mounted following SARS-CoV-2 infection. We developed a peptide-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) by selecting 7 synthetic peptides from the spike, membrane, and nucleocapsid protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2, which effectively detects the antibody response mounted by all COVID-19 convalescent tested. Strikingly, the assay shows a profound difference in antibody response among individual subjects, which may have a significant impact on disease severity.

Stress is known to have a negative impact on parent–child feeding interactions; hence, the purpose of this study is to examine how COVID-related parenting stress, which was measured using a newly developed scale, is related to parent mental health, nonresponsive feeding, and children’s self-regulation of eating. 119 parents of children ages 2–7 years old filled out questions about COVID-related parenting stress, mental health, nonresponsive feeding behaviors, and children’s self-regulation of eating. A series of multiple regressions were run to predict parent anxiety and psychological distress from COVID-related parenting stress. COVID-related parenting stress was found to be a significant predictor of both parent anxiety and psychological distress. When COVID-related parenting stress was further broken down into COVID-Related Job/Financial Security Stress and COVID-Related Family Safety/Stability Stress, COVID-Related Job/Financial Security Stress predicted psychological distress while COVID-Related Family Safety/Stability Stress predicted parent anxiety. Moderation analyses were also run to test the difference across the parents of children under 5 years of age and those of children who were 5 years of age and older regarding the association of COVID-related parenting stress and either parent anxiety or psychological distress. There was no significant difference across age. Lastly, COVID-related parenting stress and nonresponsive feeding practices were simultaneously entered into a multiple regression to predict children’s self-regulation of eating, and COVID-related parenting stress and parent distrust in appetite were both found to decrease children’s ability to self-regulate energy intake. Based on findings from this study, researchers interested in improving children’s self-regulation of eating and long-term health outcomes should continue to target the reduction of nonresponsive parent feeding behaviors, but they should also aim to look beyond specific parent feeding behaviors by attempting to help parents manage stressors in their lives.

Trainees also receive little preparation for conducting telemedicine visits, which have become increasingly important in clinical care. We present a formative standardized patient (SP) encounter to introduce medical students to the diagnosis and treatment of menopausal symptoms and the process of conducting a telemedicine visit. METHODS: We designed a virtual telemedicine encounter with an SP for medical students. Students received feedback via a post-encounter note on history taking, differential diagnosis, and diagnostics/management and an SP debrief. We collected student input on the experience at the midpoint and end of clerkship and analyzed it for recurring themes. We calculated summary statistics from student post-encounter notes. RESULTS: Thirty-two OB/GYN students completed the menopause telemedicine SP encounter between April and June 2020. Students scored a median of 20 out of 45 (interquartile range: 18, 22) on the post-encounter note. All students correctly provided a diagnosis of perimenopause/menopause; however, 50% did not offer any strategy for counseling or managing menopausal symptoms. Students expressed discomfort with using a telehealth format (78%) but found it a useful skill to practice (47%). A majority (66%) found the educational encounter to be of excellent or above-average educational value. DISCUSSION: While medical students demonstrated discomfort with both managing menopause and utilizing a telemedicine format, this SP case provided an opportunity for them to practice both skills in a safe learning environment.

Rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) can detect subtle changes in clotting activity and has been used to demonstrate longitudinal coagulopathy in COVID over time. However, typical ROTEM channels including EXTEM and INTEM are affected by anticoagulant use. Un-activated native ROTEM with addition of heparinase (NaHEPTEM) should be a more accurate marker given the multiple anticoagulant protocols in use during COVID-19 treatment. Our aim is to describe coagulopathy in COVID using NaHEPTEM longitudinally in a group of patients. Methods: This multi-center prospective cohort study was conducted during the initial COVID-19 disease surge in New York City at an urban hospital system with large infected population. Adult (>18y) patients admitted with new oxygen requirement secondary to COVID-19 disease were recruited either in the emergency department or inpatient floors within 24 hours of admission. Blood samples were collected for ROTEM processing at enrollment then every 72 hours for 21 days unless discharged or deceased. The main study outcome included NaHEPTEM values for clotting time (CT), clot formation time (CFT), maximal clot firmness (MCF) and maximal lysis (ML). Additional data was collected on conventional clotting assays and inflammatory markers, disease severity, and mortality. Results: There were 39 patients with ROTEM results included in the data analysis (mean age, 66.5 years;female, 50.0%). Admission SOFA score mean was 3.88. Mortality occurred in 10/39 (25.6%) of patients and ICU admission in 13/39 (33.3%). Therapeutic anticoagulation was initiated in 28/39 (71.7%) of patients as inpatients, with the rest receiving prophylactic subcutaneous heparin. ROTEM results were grouped into three-day blocks for analysis using day of enrollment as day 0. NaHEPTEM CT median values were within manufacturer reference range at all time points. CFT median values were below reference range until the period of days 9-11 since admission. MCF median values also were above reference range until days 9-11. ML median values were highest for admission NaHEPTEM tests (4% lysis) but no values were outside the manufacturer reference range of 15% lysis. None of the admission NaHEPTEM values were significantly associated with mortality. Conclusion: Modification of standard ROTEM channels using un-activated testing with heparinase addition demonstrates the expected reduced clotting times and increased clot firmness in COVID-19 associated hypercoagulability. Use of therapeutic and prophylactic anticoagulation was common in this population, and results of heparinase to ROTEM testing eliminates this confounding effect. Longitudinal assessment shows normalization of multiple hypercoagulable effects in COVID-19 disease around days 9-11 in this moderately ill cohort. [Formula presented]","Maher, P.

However, literature on mental health effects including post-traumatic consequences of the pandemic is scarce. Objective: The current study examined post-traumatic stress (PTS), growth (PTG), and depreciation (PTD) during the pandemic, and explored factors associated with these mental health outcomes in an adult community sample from Turkey. Method: A total of 685 participants responded to an online survey that gathered data on sociodemographic characteristics, financial loss during the pandemic, time spent at home and frequency of social media use, perception of COVID-related risks, stress, and event-related rumination. Data analysis included correlation and regression analyses. Results: Results showed that PTS, PTG, and PTD were positively correlated with each other. Younger age and being single were associated with higher PTS and PTD, and lower education levels predicted all three outcomes. Experiencing financial loss during the pandemic, more frequent social media use to follow COVID-related news and posts, and longer time spent at home during the pandemic were associated with higher PTS. Anticipating financial risks during the pandemic were associated with all outcomes while anticipating health-related risks due to COVID-19 and perceived stress levels predicted PTS and PTD but not PTG. Both intrusive and deliberate rumination were associated with higher levels of PTS and PTD, and PTG was predicted solely by deliberate rumination. Moreover, provisional PTSD was indicated in 47.9% of the participants. Membership to the provisional PTSD group was predicted by age, level of education, time spent on social media, anticipating COVID‐19–related health risks, perceived stress, and event-related rumination. Conclusions: The current study provides empirical evidence for the short-term post-traumatic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and related factors, which can help to guide mental health services during the pandemic.","Ikizer, Gözde; Karanci, Ayse Nuray; Gul, Ervin; Dilekler, Ilknur",European journal of psychotraumatology,661,1

In 2016, the Urban HEART was adapted and used by the Healthy Environments Partnership, a long-standing community-based participatory research partnership focused on addressing social determinants of health in Detroit, Michigan, to identify health equity gaps in the city. This paper uses the tool to: (1) examine the geographic distributions of key determinants of health in Detroit, across the five Urban HEART specified domains: physical environment and infrastructure, social and human development, economics, governance, and population health, and (2) determine whether these indicators are associated with the population health indicators at the neighborhood level. In addition to the Urban HEART matrix, we developed various tools including graphs and maps to further examine Detroit’s health equity gaps. Although not required by Urban HEART, we statistically analyzed the associations between each indicator with the health outcomes. Our results showed that all the domains contained one or more indicators associated with one or more health outcomes, making this an effective tool to study health equity in Detroit. The Urban HEART Detroit project comes at a critical time where the nation is focusing on health equity and understanding underlying determinants of health inequities in urban areas.

Overall, despite conflicting findings, it appears that recipient platelets may play a pathogenic role in antibody-mediated TRALI, however, their contribution appears to be limited. It is imperative to first validate the involvement of recipient platelets by standardizing the animal models, methods, reagents and read-outs for lung injury and taking the animal housing environment into consideration. For the involvement of transfused platelets in TRALI, it appears that predominantly lipids such as ceramide in stored platelets are able to induce TRALI in animal models.

Initial evaluation with a series of radiographs covering the skull base, neck, chest, and abdomen did not reveal the swab. On further clinical evaluation, the swab was found endoscopically, lodged between the left inferior turbinate and nasal floor, and was removed by an otorhinolaryngologist. Using a phantom model, we aimed to delineate an imaging technique to better visualize the aluminum shaft of the nasopharyngeal swab on radiographs to help in identification. A technique using lower tube voltage (kVp) with tight collimation centered at the nasal bones area produced the best visualization of the aluminum shaft of the swab. Recognition that aluminum foreign bodies may be difficult to visualize radiographically and optimization of radiograph acquisition technique may help guide clinical management in unusual cases. Further evaluation with computed tomography or endoscopy should be considered in suspected cases where radiographs are negative.","Azar, Antoine; Wessell, Daniel E.; Janus, Jeffrey R.; Simon, Leslie V.",Skeletal Radiol,661,21

Recently, the need for ICU beds has reached unprecedented levels and the management and treatment of critically ill patients has been in focus. The aim of the study was to assess the targeted and actual nurse-to-patient (NPR) and physician-to-patient ratios (PPR) regarding patients with and without COVID-19. Methods We conducted a nationwide online survey assessing the standard of care in German ICUs treating patients with COVID-19. We asked questions regarding targeted PPR and NPR and their implementation in daily clinical practice to heads of German ICU departments. Results We received 244 responses of which 171 were eligible for final analysis. Targeted median PPR ratio was 8 [interquartile range (IQR) = 4] and targeted NPR was 2 (IQR = 1). For COVID-19 patients, the median targeted PPR was 6 (IQR = 2) and the median targeted NPR was 2 (IQR = 0). Targeted PPRs were rarely met by 15.2% and never met by 3.5% of responding institutions. Targeted NPRs were rarely met in 32.2% and never in 5.3% of responding institutions. Conclusion In contrast to PPR, targeted NPRs were largely unattainable in German ICUs. Our results raise concern in view of studies linking worse outcomes in critically ill patients to suboptimal NPRs. This warrants further health policy efforts regarding optimal staffing in the ICU.","Grimm, Clemens; Dickel, Steffen; Sachkova, Alexandra; Popp, Maria; Golinksi, Martin; Fichtner, Falk; Kranke, Peter; Seeber, Christian; Laudi, Sven; Voigt-Radloff, Sebastian; Moerer, Onnen",Cureus,661,26

This topic has been brought into sharp focus in recent years following significant outbreaks of viral diseases such as those causing severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome, as well as devastating outbreaks of diseases caused by the Ebola, Marburg, Zika and Lassa fever viruses, to name only a few examples. Additionally, bacterial infections leading to bubonic and pneumonic plague, most notably in Madagascar in 2018, as well as malaria in many tropical countries, melioidosis in south east Asia and tularaemia in northern Europe and North America, have incurred significant morbidity and mortality. In this review series, the life cycle of these pathogens and the epidemiology of disease have been reviewed in the context of potential points of intervention for the prevention of human infection. Many of the emerging pathogens are zoonoses and, as such, there is scope for intervention at the animal/insect/environmental reservoir. Other pathogens covered in this review series are considered to be re‐emerging, such as multi‐drug resistant tuberculosis.","Williamson, E. D.",Clin Exp Immunol,661,22

The events that follow virus–receptor binding and eventually lead to virus entry are poorly understood. We studied the possible effects of MHV infection on intracellular calcium in a mouse astrocytoma cell line. Using the calcium-sensitive dye fluo-3 and confocal laser scanning microscopy, we found that MHV strain JHM induced an immediate (within 20 s) and transient (lasting no longer than 2 min) calcium increase in about 5% of the infected cells. The calcium increase was blocked by antibodies against the viral spike protein, suggesting that it was specifically triggered by the interaction of the viral spikes with cells. It was also inhibited by L-type calcium channel blockers and was not detected in calcium-free medium, suggesting that the calcium increase was caused by calcium influx from the extracellular medium. Studies of the kinetics of viral replication by immunofluorescence staining of the viral nucleocapsid protein revealed that at 3 h postinfection there was roughly the same percentage of cells (5%) that produced the viral protein as the percentage of cells that had responded with a calcium signal. This finding and the virus dilution studies together suggest that calcium responders may represent cells that had been infected with multiple viruses and undergone rapid viral replication. Furthermore, calcium channel blockers, including verapamil and cadmium chloride, and the calcium chelator EGTA inhibited virus infection. Therefore, the transient intracellular calcium increase reported here may be an early signaling event associated with virus infection.","Kraeft, Stine-Kathrein; Chen, Daniel S.; Li, Hsin-Pai; Chen, Lan Bo; Lai, Michael M.C.",Experimental Cell Research,661,1

We reviewed the current COVID-19 protocols of the 15 largest hospitals in Andalusia. Antiviral treatment, empirical antibacterial agents, adjunctive therapies, anticoagulant treatment, supportive care, hospital organization, and discharge recommendations were analyzed. All protocols included were the latest updates as of July 2020. Hydroxychloroquine in monotherapy was the most frequent antiviral drug recommended for mild respiratory illness with clinical risk factors (33.3%). Combined hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin or lopinavir/ritonavir was found in 40% of protocols. The recommended treatment for patients with mild and moderate pneumonias was different antiviral combinations including hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin (93.3%) or hydroxychloroquine plus lopinavir/ritonavir (79.9%). Different combinations of hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir (46.7%) and triple therapy with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and lopinavir/ritonavir (40%) were the most recommended treatments for patients with severe pneumonia. There were five corticosteroid regimens, which used dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, or prednisone, with different doses and treatment durations. Anakinra was included in seven protocols with six different regimens. All protocols included prophylactic heparin and therapeutic doses for thromboembolism. Higher prophylactic doses of heparin for high-risk patients and therapeutic doses for patients in critical condition were included in 53.3% and 33.3% of protocols, respectively. This study showed that COVID-19 protocols varied widely in several aspects (antiviral treatment, corticosteroids, anakinra, and anticoagulation for high risk of thrombosis or critical situation).

Most of the common cold illnesses are caused by one of four HCoVs, namely HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43. Several studies have applied global transcriptomic methods to understand host responses to HCoV infection, with most studies focusing on the pandemic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) and the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2. In this study, Next Generation Sequencing was used to gain new insights into cellular transcriptomic changes elicited by alphacoronavirus HCoV-229E. HCoV-229E-infected MRC-5 cells showed marked downregulation of superpathway of cholesterol biosynthesis and eIF2 signaling pathways. Moreover, upregulation of cyclins, cell cycle control of chromosomal replication, and the role of BRCA1 in DNA damage response, alongside downregulation of the cell cycle G1/S checkpoint, suggest that HCoV-229E may favors S phase for viral infection. Intriguingly, a significant portion of key factors of cell innate immunity, interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and other transcripts of early antiviral response genes were downregulated early in HCoV-229E infection. On the other hand, early upregulation of the antiviral response factor Apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic subunit 3B (APOBEC3B) was observed. APOBEC3B cytidine deaminase signature (C-to-T) was previously observed in genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 but not HCoV-229E. Higher levels of C-to-T mutations were found in countries with high mortality rates caused by SARS-CoV-2. APOBEC activity could be a marker for new emerging CoVs. This study will enhance our understanding of commonly circulating HCoVs and hopefully provide critical information about still-emerging coronaviruses.","Friedman, Nehemya; Jacob-Hirsch, Jasmine; Drori, Yaron; Eran, Eyal; Kol, Nitzan; Nayshool, Omri; Mendelson, Ella; Rechavi, Gideon; Mandelboim, Michal",PLoS One,661,24

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to examine the extent and identify factors associated with psychological distress, fear of COVID-19 and coping. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study across 17 countries during Jun-2020 to Jan-2021. Levels of psychological distress (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale), fear of COVID-19 (Fear of COVID-19 Scale), and coping (Brief Resilient Coping Scale) were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 8,559 people participated; mean age (±SD) was 33(±13) years, 64% were females and 40% self-identified as frontline workers. More than two-thirds (69%) experienced moderate-to-very high levels of psychological distress, which was 46% in Thailand and 91% in Egypt. A quarter (24%) had high levels of fear of COVID-19, which was as low as 9% in Libya and as high as 38% in Bangladesh. More than half (57%) exhibited medium to high resilient coping; the lowest prevalence (3%) was reported in Australia and the highest (72%) in Syria. Being female (AOR 1.31 [95% CIs 1.09-1.57]), perceived distress due to change of employment status (1.56 [1.29-1.90]), comorbidity with mental health conditions (3.02 [1.20-7.60]) were associated with higher levels of psychological distress and fear. Doctors had higher psychological distress (1.43 [1.04-1.97]), but low levels of fear of COVID-19 (0.55 [0.41-0.76]); nurses had medium to high resilient coping (1.30 [1.03-1.65]). CONCLUSIONS: The extent of psychological distress, fear of COVID-19 and coping varied by country; however, we identified few higher risk groups who were more vulnerable than others. There is an urgent need to prioritise health and well-being of those people through well-designed intervention that may need to be tailored to meet country specific requirements.

Although this is not meant as a complete substitute, critics argue that online education has widened the ‘diploma disease’ crisis. They argued that this would lead to serious long-term problems which may become irreversible. This comparative study was conducted using an ‘empirical survey’ with 120 students from each group (before and during COVID-19, giving a total of 240 samples/students) to conduct an in-depth study of the academic and job-ready performance of graduates. Findings show that pre-pandemic students did poorly academically compared to during-pandemic counterparts. On the other hand, pre-pandemic graduates achieved better job-readiness scores which included both aptitude and practicum. Moreover, both groups achieved well in terms of academic performance compared to their job-readiness scores. This leads to the question: is it the role of HE to value the concept of sustainable production or to produce certificates/qualifications?

This decision problem is closely related to the problem of optimal sensor selection, which is a very active research subject in control engineering. The goal of this paper is to propose a policy to smartly select the individuals to be tested. The main idea is to model the epidemics as a stochastic dynamic system and to select the individual to be tested accordingly to some optimality criteria, e.g. to minimize the probability of undetected asymptomatic cases. Every day, the probability of infection of the different individuals is updated making use of the stochastic model of the phenomenon and of the information collected in the previous days. Simulations for a closed community of 10’000 individuals show that the proposed technique, coupled with a selective confinement policy, can reduce the spread of the disease while limiting the number of individuals confined if compared to the simple contact tracing of positive and to an off-line test selection strategy based on the number of contacts.","Pezzutto, Matthias; Bono Rosselló, Nicolás; Schenato, Luca; Garone, Emanuele",Annu Rev Control,661,16

In such stressful situations, remote cardiac rehabilitation (CR) might be a viable alternative to the outpatient CR program. METHODS: We prospectively investigated patients hospitalized for heart failure (HF) with a left ventricular ejection fraction of < 50%. As for patients who participated in the remote CR program, telephone support was provided by cardiologists and nurses who specialized in HF every 2 weeks after discharge. The emergency readmission rate within 30 days of discharge was compared among the outpatient CR, remote CR, and non-CR groups, and the EQ-5D score was compared between the outpatient CR and remote CR groups. RESULTS: The participation rate of HF patients in our remote CR program elevated during the COVID-19 pandemic. As observed in the outpatient CR group (n = 69), the emergency readmission rate within 30 days of discharge was lower in the remote CR group (n = 30) than in the non-CR group (n = 137) (P = 0.02). The EQ-5D score was higher in the remote CR group than in the outpatient CR group (P = 0.03) 30 days after discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Remote CR is as effective as outpatient CR for improving the short-term prognosis of patients hospitalized for heart failure post-discharge. This suggests that the remote CR program can be provided as a good alternative to the outpatient CR program.","Nakayama, Atsuko; Takayama, Naoko; Kobayashi, Momoko; Hyodo, Kanako; Maeshima, Naomi; Takayuki, Fujiwara; Morita, Hiroyuki; Komuro, Issei",Environ Health Prev Med,661,1

In this review, we provide an overview of the incidence and prevalence of arterial and venous thrombotic events in patients with COVID-19 and highlight the limitations in the studies to date. Asymptomatic individuals with COVID-19 and those with mild symptoms are at very low risk of thrombotic complications. However, rates of thrombosis are substantially increased in hospitalised patients, and are strikingly high in those patients who are critically-ill requiring treatment on the intensive care unit and especially those requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Clinicians managing such patients need to be aware of these risks and take appropriate steps with respect to thromboprophylaxis and heightened clinical vigilance.

It is an important cause of morbidity and mortality burden in the developing world. Globally, TB is the number one cause of death from any single infectious disease agent that plagued an estimated 10 million (range, 8.9–11.0 million) people in 2019 alone. The Eastern Mediterranean region comprised 8.2% of the worldwide share of TB cases in 2019. Methods: in April 2019, the World Health Organization's (WHO) country office of Turkey started three TB centers in the cities of A'zaz, Idleb, and Afrin in northwest Syria, to provide the population with quality TB treatment curative services. The objectives of the project involved provision of full package of TB services in alignment with WHO TB standards and protocols. Three contractors i.e., national NGOs, were selected after a rigorous process in accordance with WHO policies. These newly established centers were equipped with the essential medical supplies, including well-functioning X-ray and microscopy laboratories run by WHO-trained medical doctors and lab technicians. Results: Based on the quarterly reports submitted by the WHO partners, from the last two quarters of the year 2019, and the four quarters for the year 2020, out of 785 cases diagnosed either by clinical, laboratory, or radiological assessment, 251 cases were bacteriologically confirmed as TB cases against the backdrop of 2236 bacteriological investigations done and a weekly average of 31 sputum specimens processed. A total of 316 smear positive slides were identified during the study period, with the proportion of smear positive slides to be 14.13%. Clinical status determined after 6 months of treatment revealed that out of the 181 patients enrolled in the third quarter of 2019, 128 patients were either cured or successfully completed their TB treatment; with a treatment success rate of 70.7% and in quarter 4, 2019 those figures were respectively: 133, 82 and 61.7%. Conclusion: Despite the challenging and protracted complex humanitarian situation in northwest Syria, the number of patients enrolled and the proportion who successfully completed the TB treatment is acceptable. However, these results are preliminary, as clinical outcomes were available only for the first and second cohorts of patients enrolled. Innovative solutions and flexibility in the execution and continued expansion of this promising project are imperative.","Alashavi, Hani; Daher, Mahmoud; Chorgoliani, Dato; Saflo, Molham; Zeidan, Mohammed; Huseyinibrahim, Fedi; Ismail, Eyup; Yousef, Abdul Raouf Haj; Ayat, Khalil; Elobayd, Ekrem; Dadu, Andre; Shaikh, Masood Ali",Front Public Health,661,17

Associations with HH indication, professional group, clinical area and institution were determined using a generalized linear mixed effects model. RESULTS: Based on 2056 observations, overall HH compliance [95% confidence interval] was 32% [30%–34%]. HH compliance was highest in the consultation area (41% [38%–45%]) and after contact to body fluids (45% [40%–50%]), and lowest in the pre‐OR area (20% [15%–24%]) and before clean/aseptic procedures (12% [9%–15%]).

We identified an HLA gene, HLA-DPA1, in which specific alleles were associated with the risk of SARS-CoV-2 positivity and COVID-19 disease. HLA-DPA1*01:03 was associated with reduced incidence of SARS-CoV-2 positivity, whereas HLA-DPA1*03:01 was associated with increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 positivity. These data suggest a model in which COVID-19 severity is influenced by immunodominant peptides derived from SARS-CoV-2 preferentially presented by specific HLA-DP molecules to either protective (for asymptomatic COVID-19) or pathogenic T cells (in severe COVID-19). Although this study is limited to comparing SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative subjects, these data suggest that HLA typing of COVID-19 patients stratified for disease severity may be informative for identifying biomarkers and disease mechanisms in high-risk individuals","Shen, Y.; Ostrov, D.; Rananaware, S.; Jain, P.

Broiler chickens were subcutaneously immunized with isotonic saline (control), Eimeria recombinant profilin alone, or profilin emulsified with QCDC at 1 and 7 days post-hatch, and orally challenged with live Eimeria acervulina at 7 days following the last immunization. Body weight gains, gut lesion scores, fecal oocyst outputs, profilin serum antibody titers, lymphocyte proliferation, and intestinal cytokine transcript levels were assessed as measures of protective immunity. Chickens immunized with profilin plus QCDC showed increased body weight gains and decreased intestinal lesion scores compared with the profilin only or control groups. However, no differences were found in fecal oocyst shedding among the three groups. Profilin serum antibody titers and antigen-induced peripheral blood lymphocyte proliferation in the profilin/QCDC group were higher compared with the profilin only and control groups. Finally, while immunization with profilin alone or profilin plus QCDC uniformly increased the levels of intestinal transcripts encoding all cytokines examined (IL-1β, IL-10, IL-12, IL-15, IL-17F, and IFN-γ) compared with the control group, transcripts for IL-10 and IL-17F were further increased in the profilin/QCDC group compared with the profilin only group. In summary, this study provides the first evidence of the immunoenhancing activities of QCDC adjuvant in poultry.","Lee, Sung-Hyen; Lillehoj, Hyun S.; Jang, Seung I.; Lee, Kyung-Woo; Yancey, Robert J.; Dominowski, Paul",Vaccine,661,5

The present study aimed to identify the echocardiographic findings in hospitalized COVID‐19 patients and their utility in disease management. METHODS: We included patients who were diagnosed with COVID‐19 using polymerase chain reaction and those who underwent echocardiographic examination during their hospitalization. RESULTS: Altogether, 45 patients were evaluated. The mean age was 61.4 ± 12.2 years. Hypertension (n = 29, 64%) and diabetes mellitus (n = 25, 55%) were the most common comorbidities followed by congestive heart failure (n = 11, 24%), coronary artery disease (n = 9, 20%), and valvular heart disease (n = 3, 7%). Eight patients (18%) showed evidence of myocardial injury, as suggested by elevated troponin levels. Brain natriuretic peptide was elevated in 14 patients (36%), and 14 patients had left ventricular dysfunction in the form of reduced ejection fraction (31%). Right ventricular (RV) dilatation was observed in six patients, and five patients had reduced RV ejection fraction. RV pressure and volume overload were observed in three patients. RV thrombus was observed in one patient. Pulmonary pressure was elevated in 10 patients (24%).

SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from fecal samples, and active viral replication was reported in human intestinal cells. The human gut also harbors an enormous amount of resident viruses (collectively known as the virome) that play a role in regulating host immunity and disease pathophysiology. Understanding gut virome perturbation that underlies SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity is an unmet need. METHODS: We enrolled 98 COVID-19 patients with varying disease severity (3 asymptomatic, 53 mild, 34 moderate, 5 severe, 3 critical) and 78 non-COVID-19 controls matched for gender and co-morbidities. All subjects had fecal specimens sampled at inclusion. Blood specimens were collected for COVID-19 patients at admission to test for inflammatory markers and white cell counts. Among COVID-19 cases, 37 (38%) patients had serial fecal samples collected 2 to 3 times per week from time of hospitalization until after discharge. Using shotgun metagenomics sequencing, we sequenced and profiled the fecal RNA and DNA virome. We investigated alterations and longitudinal dynamics of the gut virome in association with disease severity and blood parameters. RESULTS: Patients with COVID-19 showed underrepresentation of Pepper mild mottle virus (RNA virus) and multiple bacteriophage lineages (DNA viruses) and enrichment of environment-derived eukaryotic DNA viruses in fecal samples, compared to non-COVID-19 subjects. Such gut virome alterations persisted up to 30 days after disease resolution. Fecal virome in SARS-CoV-2 infection harbored more stress-, inflammation-, and virulence-associated gene encoding capacities including those pertaining to bacteriophage integration, DNA repair, and metabolism and virulence associated with their bacterial host. Baseline fecal abundance of 10 virus species (1 RNA virus, pepper chlorotic spot virus, and 9 DNA virus species) inversely correlated with disease COVID-19 severity. These viruses inversely correlated with blood levels of pro-inflammatory proteins, white cells, and neutrophils. Among the 10 COVID-19 severity-associated DNA virus species, 4 showed inverse correlation with age; 5 showed persistent lower abundance both during disease course and after disease resolution relative to non-COVID-19 subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Both enteric RNA and DNA virome in COVID-19 patients were different from non-COVID-19 subjects, which persisted after disease resolution of COVID-19. Gut virome may calibrate host immunity and regulate severity to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our observation that gut viruses inversely correlated with both severity of COVID-19 and host age may partly explain that older subjects are prone to severe and worse COVID-19 outcomes. Altogether, our data highlight the importance of human gut virome in severity and potentially therapeutics of COVID-19.

In this study, we conduct a scenario analysis for COVID-19 in Malaysia using a simple universality class of the SIR system and extensions thereof (i.e., the inclusion of temporary immunity through the reinfection problems and limited medical resources scenarios leads to the SIRS-type model). This system has been employed in order to provide further insights on the long-term outcomes of COVID-19 pandemic. As a case study, the COVID-19 transmission dynamics are investigated using daily confirmed cases in Malaysia, where some of the epidemiological parameters of this system are estimated based on the fitting of the model to real COVID-19 data released by the Ministry of Health Malaysia (MOH). We observe that this model is able to mimic the trend of infection trajectories of COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia and it is possible for transmission dynamics to be influenced by the reinfection force and limited medical resources problems. A rebound effect in transmission could occur after several years and this situation depends on the intensity of reinfection force. Our analysis also depicts the existence of a critical value in reinfection threshold beyond which the infection dynamics persist and the COVID-19 outbreaks are rather hard to eradicate. Therefore, understanding the interplay between distinct epidemiological factors using mathematical modelling approaches could help to support authorities in making informed decisions so as to control the spread of this pandemic effectively.","Salman, Amer M.; Ahmed, Issam; Mohd, Mohd Hafiz; Jamiluddin, Mohammad Subhi; Dheyab, Mohammed Ali",Comput Biol Med,661,24

RESULTS: 912 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to hospital, in which, 90 cases (9.87％) presented with diarrhea. Among the 90 cases, 8 cases (9％) presented with diarrhea as the initial symptom, and 24%, 17%, and 24% of the patients complained of nausea, vomiting, and poor appetite, respectively. The most common fecal characteristics on admission were watery stool (64%) and mushy stool (28%). For the defecation frequency, 37% of the cases defecated over three times a day. The median time from illness onset to diarrhea was 3.0 days (IQR 0.0-5.0) and the median duration of diarrhea was 5.0 days (IQR 2.0-9.3).

Initially, contaminated feed was proposed as a risk factor for PEDV; however, data were not available to support this theory. Here we provide proof of concept of this risk by describing a novel means for recovering PEDV-contaminated complete feed material from commercial swine sites and conducting an in vivo experiment to prove its infectivity. RESULTS: For on-farm detection of PEDV RNA in feed, paint rollers were used to collect material from at-risk feed bins from 3 clinically affected breeding herds. This material was tested by PCR and determined to be positive for PEDV-RNA (Ct = 19.50-22.20 range). To test infectivity, this material was pooled (Ct = 20.65) and a Treatment group of 3-week old PEDV-naïve piglets were allowed to consume it via natural feeding behavior. For the purpose of a Positive control, piglets were allowed to ingest feed spiked with stock PEDV (Ct = 18.23) while the negative control group received PEDV-free feed. Clinical signs of PEDV infection (vomiting and diarrhea) and viral shedding were observed in both the Positive control and Treatment group’ post-consumption with virus and microscopic lesions detected in intestinal samples No evidence of infection was observed in the Negative controls. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide proof of concept that contaminated complete feed can serve as a vehicle for PEDV infection of naïve pigs using natural feeding behavior.","Dee, Scott; Clement, Travis; Schelkopf, Adam; Nerem, Joel; Knudsen, David; Christopher-Hennings, Jane; Nelson, Eric",BMC Vet Res,661,24

The use of animal models mimicking RA, such as pristane-induced arthritis (PIA) in rats, should facilitate its genetic analysis. Pristane is a non-immunogenic synthetic oil that, after a single subcutaneous injection into DA rats, induces arthritis restricted to peripheral joints with a chronic relapsing disease course(6). To identify genes involved in the control of chronic arthritis, we made crosses between susceptible DA rats and resistant E3 rats and analysed the progeny with microsatellite markers covering the entire rat genome. Our results show that different arthritis phenotypes are associated with different chromosomal loci. Loci on chromosomes 4 and 6 ( Pia2 and Pia3 ) influence arthritis onset, whereas a locus on chromosome 12 ( Pia4 ) is associated with severity and joint erosion. We found that chronicity is associated with a different set of loci, one on chromosome 4 and the other on chromosome 14 ( Pia5, Pia6 ). These findings demonstrate for the first time that different phases of a chronic self-perpetuative disease which mimics RA are associated with distinct sets of genes.","Vingsbo-Lundberg, Carina; Nordquist, Niklas; Olofsson, Peter; Sundvall, Mats; Saxne, Tore; Pettersson, Ulf; Holmdahl., Rikard",Nat Genet,661,16

This study compared the severity of pre-pandemic symptoms and affective experiences to current symptoms to evaluate this possibility. METHODS: 148 individuals with SMI (92 with schizophrenia spectrum illnesses and 56 with affective disorders) were recruited from ongoing ecological momentary assessment studies that sampled day-to-day experiences and symptom severity prior to the pandemic. Participants completed a one-time phone survey that queried these same experiences/symptoms between April and June of 2020. RESULTS: Severity of affective experiences and psychotic symptoms remained stable across time, as did sleep duration. Well-being and the number of substances used increased during the early months of the pandemic. Increases in well-being were associated with being female and spending less time alone pre-pandemic. Patterns of stability/change did not differ according to diagnostic category. CONCLUSIONS: At this relatively early stage, individuals with SMI are not reporting a worsening of symptoms or affective experiences and instead appear to be resilient in the face of the pandemic.

The first step in this investigation was to solvate the isolated S-protein in water for molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, being observed a transition from “up” to “down” conformation of receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S-protein with angle of 54.3 and 43.0 degrees, respectively. The RBD region was more exposed to the solvent and to the possible drugs due to its enhanced surface area.

Among them, 24 best-scored ligands (14 traditional herbal isolate and 10 approved drugs) with the binding energy below –8.1 kcal/mol were selected as potential candidates to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein, preventing the human cell infection and their replication. For instance, the ivermectin drug (present in our list of promise candidates) was recently used successful to control viral replication in vitro. MD simulations were performed for the three best ligands@S-protein complexes and the binding energies were calculated using the MM/PBSA approach.

Since little is currently known about COVID-19 in pregnancy, the understanding of COVID-19 in this particular group will be updated in time, and a comprehensive review will be useful to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 in pregnancy. Based on recently published literature and official documents, this review provides an introduction to the pathogenesis, pathology, and clinical features of COVID-19 and has focused on the current researches on clinical features, pregnancy outcomes and placental histopathological analysis from pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. These viruses trigger a cytokine storm in the body, produce a series of immune responses, and cause changes in peripheral leukocytes and immune system cells leading to pregnancy complications that may be associated with viral infections. The expression of ACE2 receptors in the vascular endothelium may explain the histological changes of placentas from pregnant women infected by SARS-CoV-2. Pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia show similar clinical characteristics compared with non-pregnant counterparts.

Vaccine-enhanced disease (VED) is a type of adverse event in which disease severity is increased when a person who has received the vaccine is later infected with the relevant pathogen. VED can occur during research with experimental vaccines and/or after vaccine licensure, sometimes months or years after a person receives a vaccine. Both research ethics and public health policy should therefore address the potential for disease enhancement. Significant VED has occurred in humans with vaccines for four pathogens: measles virus, respiratory syncytial virus, Staphylococcus aureus, and dengue virus; it has also occurred in veterinary research and in animal studies of human coronavirus vaccines. Some of the immunological mechanisms involved are now well-described, but VED overall remains difficult to predict with certainty, including during public health implementation of novel vaccines. This paper summarises the four known cases in humans and explores key ethical implications. Although rare, VED has important ethical implications because it can cause serious harm, including death, and such harms can undermine vaccine confidence more generally – leading to larger public health problems. The possibility of VED remains an important challenge for current and future vaccine development and deployment. We conclude this paper by summarising approaches to the reduction of risks and uncertainties related to VED, and the promotion of public trust in vaccines.","Jamrozik, Euzebiusz; Heriot, George; Bull, Susan; Parker, Michael",Wellcome Open Res,661,26

As survival after HSCT improves, cardiovascular disease and associated risk factors have gained importance as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in this cohort. In this article, we detail the risk factors for cardiovascular disease and their impact in patients undergoing HSCT. Additionally, we critically review the data on the impact of physical exercise in patients undergoing HSCT. Although limited by significant heterogeneity in methodologies, small sample sizes, attrition, and lack of long-term cardiovascular follow-up, most of these studies reinforce the beneficial effects of physical activity and exercise in this patient population. Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is a structured exercise and lifestyle modification program that is typically instituted in patients who experience acute cardiovascular events. We review the data on CR in the oncologic and nononcologic populations with an aim of building a framework for use of CR in HSCT patients.","Mohananey, Divyanshu; Sarau, Alexandra; Kumar, Rohit; Lewandowski, David; Abreu-Sosa, Sol M.; Nathan, Sunita; Okwuosa, Tochukwu M.",JACC CardioOncol,661,28

Early detection of muscle fatigue and muscular paralysis helps in the diagnosis, prediction, and prevention of COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 patients. Nowadays, the biomedical and clinical domains widely used the electromyography (EMG) signal due to its ability to differentiate various neuromuscular diseases. In general, nerves or muscles and the spinal cord influence numerous neuromuscular disorders. The clinical examination plays a major role in early finding and diagnosis of these diseases; this research study focused on the prediction of muscular paralysis using EMG signals. Machine learning–based diagnosis of the diseases has been widely used due to its efficiency and the hybrid feature extraction (FE) methods with deep learning classifier are used for the muscular paralysis disease prediction. The discrete wavelet transform (DWT) method is applied to decompose the EMG signal and reduce feature degradation. The proposed hybrid FE method consists of Yule-Walker, Burg’s method, Renyi entropy, mean absolute value, min-max voltage FE, and other 17 conventional features for prediction of muscular paralysis disease. The hybrid FE method has the advantage of extract the relevant features from the signals and the Relief-F feature selection (FS) method is applied to select the optimal relevant feature for the deep learning classifier. The University of California, Irvine (UCI), EMG-Lower Limb Dataset is used to determine the performance of the proposed classifier. The evaluation shows that the proposed hybrid FE method achieved 88% of precision, while the existing neural network (NN) achieved 65% of precision and the support vector machine (SVM) achieved 35% of precision on whole EMG signal.","Subramani, Prabu; K, Srinivas; B, Kavitha Rani; R, Sujatha; B.D, Parameshachari",Pers Ubiquitous Comput,661,1

As of April 28, 2020, South Africa reported the highest number of COVID-19 cases in Sub- Sahara Africa. The country took aggressive steps to control the spread of the virus including setting a national command team for COVID-19 and putting the country on a complete lockdown for more than 100 days. Evidence across most countries has shown that, it is vital to monitor the progression of pandemics and assess the effects of various public health measures, such as lockdowns. Countries need to have scientific tools to assist in monitoring and assessing the effectiveness of mitigation interventions. The objective of this study was thus to assess the extent to which a systems dynamics model can forecast COVID-19 infections in South Africa and be a useful tool in evaluating government interventions to manage the epidemic through ‘what if’ simulations. Design and Methods: This study presents a systems dynamics model (SD) of the COVID-19 infection in South Africa, as one of such tools. The development of the SD model in this study is grounded in design science research which fundamentally builds on prior research of modelling complex systems. Results: The SD model satisfactorily replicates the general trend of COVID-19 infections and recovery for South Africa within the first 100 days of the pandemic. The model further confirms that the decision to lockdown the country was a right one, otherwise the country’s health capacity would have been overwhelmed. Going forward, the model predicts that the level of infection in the country will peak towards the last quarter of 2020, and thereafter start to decline. Conclusions: Ultimately, the model structure and simulations suggest that a systems dynamics model can be a useful tool in monitoring, predicting and testing interventions to manage COVID-19 with an acceptable margin of error. Moreover, the model can be developed further to include more variables as more facts on the COVID-19 emerge.","Mutanga, Shingirirai Savious; Ngungu, Mercy; Tshililo, Fhulufhelo Phillis; Kaggwa, Martin",J Public Health Res,661,26

In our model, we intend to solve a two phases optimisation problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximise the overall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take different decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximise their utility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through various additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model people’s behaviour. The analysis of simulation results provides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on when to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during the whole period of the outbreak.","Fu, Yuting; Xiang, Haitao; Jin, Hanqing; Wang, Ning",Procedia Computer Science,661,4

These so-called UK, South African or Brazilian variants are characterized by combinations of mutations which allow them to be distinguished from the variants which have circulated since the start of the epidemic. The impact of these variants on the functioning of healthcare systems requires monitoring the spread of these variants, which are more contagious, more lethal and may reinfect people who are already immune to a natural infection or to a vaccination. Monitoring the viral genome in wastewater has shown great value in early detection of the dynamics of virus spreading in populations. The sequencing of viral genomes is used in humans, but its application and interpretation on wastewater matrices are much more complex due to the diversity of circulating strains. Also this study demonstrates the possibility of following certain mutations found in these new variants by targeted RT-qPCR. This study is the first carried out in France demonstrating the spreading dynamics of the 69-70 deletion in the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2.","WURTZER, S.; Waldman, P.; Levert, M.; Mouchel, J.-M.; Gorge, O.; Boni, M.; Maday, Y.; Obepine consortium,; Marechal, V.; Moulin, L.",,661,10

Concerns about potential (systemic) risks resulting from overdependence on global supply networks have been magnified during the lockdowns triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic in the last year. Strengthening local and/or domestic networks may be an adequate approach to overcome the severe economic implications of this overdependence, but it also rises the question of how one can measure the strength of domestic supply/production networks and design an appropriate structure. The objective of this paper is to propose a method for measurement and to provide a first-cut analysis with this method on a sample of economies. Building on ecological network analysis, we borrow the Finn cycling index from its toolbox and show a ranking of countries with respect to the strength of their domestic production networks based on this index. The results suggest that the countries are very heterogeneous both in terms of the level of cycling index and its sectoral decomposition. Using panel-econometric techniques, we point out the role of the openness and structural asymmetry in shaping this strength, also controlling for other macroeconomic characteristics of the economies. The estimates reveal that openness has a negative, while asymmetry has a positive effect on this index, but other country-specific characteristics also play a role in shaping the systemic operation of national economies as measured by the Finn cycling index.","Braun, Erik; Sebestyén, Tamás; Kiss, Tibor",Appl Netw Sci,661,33

To enable real-time monitoring of the incidence of mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – for which medical consultation might not be required – the Infectieradar web-based syndromic surveillance system was launched in mid-March 2020. Our aim was to quantify associations between Infectieradar participant characteristics and the incidence of self-reported COVID-19-like illness. Recruitment for this cohort study was via a web announcement. After registering, participants completed weekly questionnaires, reporting the occurrence of a set of symptoms. The incidence rate of COVID-19-like illness was estimated and multivariable Poisson regression used to estimate the relative risks associated with sociodemographic variables, lifestyle factors and pre-existing medical conditions. Between 17 March and 24 May 2020, 25 663 active participants were identified, who reported 7060 episodes of COVID-19-like illness over 131 404 person-weeks of follow-up. The incidence rate declined over the analysis period, consistent with the decline in notified cases. Male sex, age 65+ years and higher education were associated with a significantly lower COVID-19-like illness incidence rate (adjusted rate ratios (RRs) of 0.80 (95% CI 0.76–0.84), 0.77 (0.70–0.85), 0.84 (0.80–0.88), respectively) and the baseline characteristics ever-smoker, asthma, allergies, diabetes, chronic lung disease, cardiovascular disease and children in the household were associated with a higher incidence (RRs of 1.11 (1.04–1.19) to 1.69 (1.50–1.90)). Web-based syndromic surveillance has proven useful for monitoring the temporal trends in, and risk factors associated with, the incidence of mild disease.

This study uses data from an extensive questionnaire survey by the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development of the People’s Republic of China (MOHURD) in 11 cities. This study uses the descriptive statistical method and Hierarchical Linear Model (HLM) to study the perception of urban public safety (PUPS) and its influencing factors of floating population with higher education background (FPHEB) from the three levels of city–district–individual. The study finds that (1) when FPHEB is placed in a district and a city at the same time, the influence of the city on PUPS is greater than that of the district; (2) the urban’s infrastructure security and economic development security positively affect the floating population; (3) the GDP and the number of stadiums and hospitals of the district are significantly positively correlated with the PUPS of the FPHEB, whereas the increase of population density and road density have negative effects; (4) FPHEB with distinct attributes will make their PUPS also different. This study is not only a reflection on the construction of urban public security after the COVID-19 outbreak but can also be used as a theoretical reference for the government in constructing urban public security. This study also enriches the research on the floating population and makes good scientific suggestions for the city’s PUPS of the FPHEB.

Happiness was found to be a protective factor with a lesser likelihood of experiencing severe stress (OR = 0.240, 95% CI: 0.180, 0.321), anxiety (OR = 0.336, 95% CI: 0.273, 0.414), and depression (OR = 0.121, 95% CI: 0.088, 0.165) with higher happiness levels. Higher score of work-to-family conflict contributes to greater odds of having severe levels of anxiety (OR = 1.453, 95% CI: 1.161, 1.818). While greater likelihood of developing severe stress (OR = 1.468, 95% CI: 1.109, 1.943) and severe anxiety (OR = 1.317, 95% CI: 1.059, 1.638) under increasing score of family-to-work conflict. Besides, happiness is found to negatively linked with lower negative emotional symptoms, while work-family conflict and family-work conflict are positively linked with higher negative emotional symptoms. Conclusion: Lockdown implementation during the COVID-19 pandemic appears to have a significant impact on university students' negative emotional symptoms, happiness, and work-life balance. Happiness was found to be a protective factor while the state of work-life balance is a risk factor that can predict students' negative emotional symptoms.","Wan Mohd Yunus, Wan Mohd Azam; Badri, Siti Khadijah Zainal; Panatik, Siti Aisyah; Mukhtar, Firdaus",Front Psychiatry,661,16

However, a comprehensive picture of vaccine-induced immune factors and pathways have not been systematically collected and analyzed. To address this issue, we developed VaximmutorDB, a web-based database system of vaccine immune factors (abbreviated as “vaximmutors”) manually curated from peer-reviewed articles. VaximmutorDB currently stores 1,740 vaccine immune factors from 13 host species (e.g., human, mouse, and pig). These vaximmutors were induced by 154 vaccines for 46 pathogens. Top 10 vaximmutors include three antibodies (IgG, IgG2a and IgG1), Th1 immune factors (IFN-γ and IL-2), Th2 immune factors (IL-4 and IL-6), TNF-α, CASP-1, and TLR8. Many enriched host processes (e.g., stimulatory C-type lectin receptor signaling pathway, SRP-dependent cotranslational protein targeting to membrane) and cellular components (e.g., extracellular exosome, nucleoplasm) by all the vaximmutors were identified. Using influenza as a model, live attenuated and killed inactivated influenza vaccines stimulate many shared pathways such as signaling of many interleukins (including IL-1, IL-4, IL-6, IL-13, IL-20, and IL-27), interferon signaling, MARK1 activation, and neutrophil degranulation. However, they also present their unique response patterns. While live attenuated influenza vaccine FluMist induced significant signal transduction responses, killed inactivated influenza vaccine Fluarix induced significant metabolism of protein responses. Two different Yellow Fever vaccine (YF-Vax) studies resulted in overlapping gene lists; however, they shared more portions of pathways than gene lists. Interestingly, live attenuated YF-Vax simulates significant metabolism of protein responses, which was similar to the pattern induced by killed inactivated Fluarix. A user-friendly web interface was generated to access, browse and search the VaximmutorDB database information. As the first web-based database of vaccine immune factors, VaximmutorDB provides systematical collection, standardization, storage, and analysis of experimentally verified vaccine immune factors, supporting better understanding of protective vaccine immunity.","Berke, Kimberly; Sun, Peter; Ong, Edison; Sanati, Nasim; Huffman, Anthony; Brunson, Timothy; Loney, Fred; Ostrow, Joseph; Racz, Rebecca; Zhao, Bin; Xiang, Zuoshuang; Masci, Anna Maria; Zheng, Jie; Wu, Guanming; He, Yongqun",Front Immunol,661,24

There is a link between the new coronavirus and changes in biochemical indicators, such as coagulation functions. Hypercoagulable state of blood caused by infections may lead to cerebrovascular diseases. More attention should be paid to patients with COVID‐19, especially critically ill individuals with history of cerebrovascular disease who may have high risk of stroke. METHODS: 193 patients with COVID‐19 were enrolled in the study. These patients were categorized into nonsevere (143 patients) and severe (50 patients) groups. This study evaluated laboratory tests, including routine blood tests, C‐reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, electrolytes, and coagulation functions. Furthermore, neurological function and stroke risks were evaluated in this study. RESULTS: Compared to the nonsevere group, there were increases in white blood cells, neutrophil count, interleukin‐6, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C‐reactive protein in the severe group (p < .05). For coagulation functions, parameters like prothrombin time, international normalized ratio, activated partial thromboplastin time, thrombin time, D‐dimer, and fibrin degradation products were increased significantly in the severe group (p < .01). Severe patients also demonstrated higher scores on the Framingham stroke risk profile and lower Glasgow scores (p < .05). Furthermore, significant associations were noticed between stroke risk and age, blood cell count, neutrophil count, D‐dimmer, and fibrin degradation productions (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Data suggested that coagulation functions were affected in patients with COVID‐19. Hypercoagulable state in patients may lead to potential high risk of stroke.","Qiu, Feng; Wu, Yue; Zhang, Aiqing; Xie, Guojin; Cao, Hui; Du, Mingyang; Jiang, Haibo; Li, Shun; Ding, Ming",Brain Behav,661,24

Therefore, we assessed stressors, coping behaviors, and resources needed in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic in a sample of 162 perinatal (125 pregnant and 37 postpartum) women in the United States. METHODS: A mixed-methods study captured quantitative responses regarding stressors and coping, along with qualitative responses to open-ended questions regarding stress and resources needed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Logistic and linear regression models were used to analyze differences between pregnant and postpartum participants, as well as differences across key demographic variables. Qualitative content analysis was used to analyze open-ended questions. RESULTS: During the COVID-pandemic, food scarcity and shelter-in-place restrictions made it difficult for pregnant women to find healthy foods. Participants also reported missing prenatal appointments, though many reported using telemedicine to obtain these services. Financial issues were prevalent in our sample and participants had difficulty obtaining childcare. After controlling for demographic variables, pregnant women were less likely to engage in healthy stress-coping behaviors than postpartum women. Lastly, we were able to detect signals of increased stressors induced by the COVID-19 pandemic, and less social support, in perinatal women of racial and ethnic minority, and lower-income status. Qualitative results support our survey findings as participants expressed concerns about their baby contracting COVID-19 while in the hospital, significant others missing the delivery or key obstetric appointments, and wanting support from friends, family, and birthing classes. Financial resources, COVID-19 information and research as it relates to maternal-infant health outcomes, access to safe healthcare, and access to baby supplies (formula, diapers, etc.) emerged as the primary resources needed by participants. CONCLUSIONS: To better support perinatal women’s mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers should engage in conversations regarding access to resources needed to care for newborns, refer patients to counseling services (which can be delivered online/via telephone) and virtual support groups, and consistently screen pregnant women for stressors.

At present, one of the most significant discussions among scientists worldwide is interdependency of escalating environmental risk factors and the increasing rates of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), which are the leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Climate change also triggers the occurrence of NCDs through a variety of direct and indirect pathways. Therefore, it is likely that the interdependence of climate change, environmental risk factors, and NCDs as a whole poses great threat to global health. Hence, this paper aims to review the latest evidence on impacts of environmental risk factors on NCDs and methods used in establishing the cause or correlation of environmental risk factors and NCDs. The literature review leveraged online databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar with articles that matched keywords “climate change”, “environmental risk factors,” and “noncommunicable diseases”. This review shows that the burden of NCDs is increasing globally and attribution of environmental risk factors such as climate change is significant. Understanding the nature of the relation between NCDs and the environment is complex and has relied on evidence generated from multiple study designs. This paper reviews eight types of study designs that can be used to identify and measure causal and correlational nature between environment and NCDs. Future projections suggest that increases in temperatures will continue and also increase the public health burden of NCDs.","Dhimal, Meghnath; Neupane, Tamanna; Lamichhane Dhimal, Mandira",FASEB Bioadv,661,3

Material and Methods Between February 2020 and January 2021, participating oncologists from Pune (members of the Oncology Group of Pune) documented effect of COVID-19 infection in their cancer patients. Binomial logistic regression analysis as well as correlation analysis was done using Pearson Chi-square test to determine significance of clinical factors. Results A total of 29 oncologists from 20 hospitals contributed their data involving 147 cancer patients who developed COVID-19 infections. COVID-19 infection resulted in higher deaths (likelihood ratio of 4.4) amongst patients with hematological malignancies (12/44 = 27.2%) as compared with those with solid tumors (13/90 = 14.4%, p = 0.030). Patients with uncontrolled or progressive cancer (11/34 = 32.4%) when they got infected with COVID-19 had higher mortality as compared with patients whose cancer was under control (14/113 = 12.4%; p = 0.020). Complication of thromboembolic episodes (seen in eight patients; 5.4% cases) was associated with higher risk (25.6 times) of death (five-eighths; 62.5%) as compared with those who did not develop it (20/139;14.4%; p <0.001). Discussion Patients with cancer should be advised to take strict precautions to reduce the risk of being infected with COVID-19. They should also be given priority for COVID-19 vaccination. If infected with COVID-19, patients with hematological malignancy and uncontrolled cancer are at higher risk of morbidity and mortality. When they are being treated (OPD or inpatient basis), additional precautions are necessary to ensure their exposure to potential COVID-19 virus is minimized. If they get infected with COVID-19, they should be given aggressive treatment to prevent complications, especially thromboembolic episodes. If they develop any thromboembolic complication, their risk of dying are significantly higher, and management should be modified accordingly.","Hingmire, Sachin; Wategaonkar, Ravikumar; Hegde, Sujai; Mekha, Mangesh; Kulkarni, Rahul; Rajbhoj, Ashwin; Deshmukh, Chetan; Kulkarni, Padmaj; Patil, Tushar; Kanitkar, Gajanan; Wanjarkhedkar, Pankaj; Mane, Anupama; Bokil, Kamlesh; Parasnis, Amit; Gawande, Jayant; Bhatia, Jatin; Khaladkar, Bhagyashree; Sirsath, Nagesh; Melinkeri, Sameer; Kashyapi, Bhalchandra; Agrawal, Rakesh Kumar; Prabhakaran, Anushree; Desai, Isha; Kelkar, Dhananjay",South Asian J Cancer,661,21

METHODS: This study undertook a cross-sectional design to survey a convenience sample of 681 residents of North London on their social distancing (SD) behaviours, demographics, housing situation, politics, psychology and social support using an online questionnaire. Logistic regression was used to measure the associations between these explanatory factors and non-adherence to all SD rules and intentional non-adherence to SD rules. RESULTS: The vast majority (92.8%) of participants did not adhere to all SD rules and nearly half (48.6%) engaged in intentional non-adherence of rules. The odds of not adhering to all SD rules increased if a participant was not identified as highly vulnerable to COVID-19 [OR = 4.5], had lower control over others’ distancing [OR = .724], had lower control over responsibilities for which coming into contact with others was unavoidable [OR = .642], and if SD behaviours were reported after lockdown was first relaxed [OR = .261]. The odds of intentionally not adhering to SD rules increased if a participant had a lower intention to socially distance [OR = .468], had lower control over others’ distancing [OR = .829], had a doctoral degree compared to a master’s degree [OR = .332], a professional qualification [OR = .307], a bachelor’s degree [OR = .361] or work-related qualification [OR = .174], voted for the UK Government compared to not voting for the Government [OR = .461], perceived higher normative pressure from neighbours [OR = 1.121] and had greater support from friends [OR = 1.465]. CONCLUSIONS: Non-adherence to all SD rules had a stronger association with vulnerability to COVID-19 and control over SD, whereas intentional non-adherence had a stronger association with intention and anti-social psychological factors.

We detected cytoplasmic accumulations containing the viral nucleocapsid protein, viral RNA and the non-structural protein nsp3. Using EM techniques, we found that these putative viral replication sites were associated with characteristic membrane tubules and double membrane vesicles that most probably originated from ER cisternae. In addition to its presence at the replication sites, N also accumulated in the Golgi region and colocalized with the viral spike protein. Immuno-EM revealed that budding occurred at membranes of the ERGIC (ER–Golgi intermediate compartment) and the Golgi region as early as 3 h post infection, demonstrating that SARS-CoV replicates surprisingly fast. Our data suggest that SARS-CoV establishes replication complexes at ER-derived membranes. Later on, viral nucleocapsids have to be transported to the budding sites in the Golgi region where the viral glycoproteins accumulate and particle formation occurs.","Stertz, Silke; Reichelt, Mike; Spiegel, Martin; Kuri, Thomas; Martínez-Sobrido, Luis; García-Sastre, Adolfo; Weber, Friedemann; Kochs, Georg",Virology,661,1

With the spread of COVID-19, pockets exist in every country with different viral expressions. In the Chareidi (‘ultra-orthodox’) religious community, for example, rates of COVID-19 transmission and dissemination are above average compared with other communities within the same countries. While viral spread in densely populated communities is common during pandemics, several reasons have been suggested to explain the blatant flouting of public health regulations. It is easy to fault the Chareidi population for their proliferation of COVID-19, partly due to their avoidance of social media and internet aversion. However, the question remains: who is to blame for their community crisis? The ethical argument suggests that from a public health perspective, the physician needs to reach out and share medical knowledge with the community. The public’s best interests are critical in a pandemic and should supersede any considerations of cultural differences. By all indications, therefore, the physician has an ethical obligation to promote population healthcare and share medical knowledge based on ethical concepts of beneficence, non-maleficence, utilitarian ethics as well as social, procedural and distributive justice. This includes the ethical duty to reduce health disparities and convey the message that individual responsibility for health has repercussions within the context of broader social accountability. Creative channels are clearly demanded for this ethical challenge, including measured medical paternalism with appropriate cultural sensitivity in physician community outreach.","Strous, Rael D.; Karni, Tami",J Med Ethics,661,1

Methods: The model was designed using computer-aided design software and printed using a stereolithography 3D printer. The eyelid and eyeball were synthesized from polyvinyl alcohol and silicone material, respectively. Simulated tear fluid was infused through tubing attached to the eyelid using a syringe pump. With each blink cycle, the eyelid slides and flexes across the eyeball to create an artificial tear film layer. The flow-through fluid was collected using a specialized trough. Two contact lenses, etafilcon A and senofilcon A, were incubated in 2 mL of a water-soluble red dye for 24 h and then placed on the eye model (n = 3). The release of the dye was measured over 24 h using a tear flow rate of 5 µL/min. Results: Approximately 25% of the fluid that flowed over the eye model was lost due to evaporation, nonspecific absorption, and residual dead volume. Senofilcon A absorbed more dye (47.6 ± 2.7 µL) than etafilcon A (22.3 ± 2.0 µL). For etafilcon A, the release of the dye followed a burst-plateau profile in the vial but was sustained in the eye model. For senofilcon A, the release of the dye was sustained in both the vial and the eye model, though more dye was released in the vial (p < 0.05). Overall, the release of the dye from the contact lenses was higher in the vial compared with the eye model (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The blink model developed in this study could be used to measure the release of topical ophthalmic drugs or comfort agents from contact lenses. Simulation of a blink mechanism, an artificial tear film, and nonspecific absorption in an eye model may provide better results than a simple, static vial incubation model.","Phan, Chau-Minh; Shukla, Manish; Walther, Hendrik; Heynen, Miriam; Suh, David; Jones, Lyndon",Pharmaceutics,661,1

METHOD: The 1995 Kikwit Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formally Zaire) is one of the most well studied epidemics to have occurred to date. Many of the lessons learned from identifying, containing and treating that epidemic are applicable to future viral outbreaks, natural disasters and bioterrorist attacks. This is due to Ebola's highly contagious nature and high mortality rate. RESULTS: When an outbreak occurs, it often produces fear in the community and causes the basic practice of medicine to be altered. Changes seen at Kikwit included limited physical examinations, hesitance to give intravenous medications and closure of supporting hospital facilities. The Kikwit Ebola outbreak also provided beneficial psychological insight into how patients, staff and the general community respond to a biological crisis and how this will affect physicians working in an epidemic. CONCLUSIONS: General lessons from the outbreak include the importance of having simple, well-defined triage procedures; staff who are flexible and able to adapt to situations with unknowns; and the need to protect staff physically and emotionally to ensure a sustained effort to provide care.","Hall, Ryan C.W.; Hall, Richard C.W.; Chapman, Marcia J.",Gen Hosp Psychiatry,661,16

Objective: Project COVID-19 mortality trends to October 1, 2020, in 12 countries or regions that constitute >90% of the global COVID-19 deaths reported as of April 12, 2020. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Global COVID-19 Assessment of Mortality (GCAM) is an open, transparent, and continuously updated (www.cghr.org/covid) statistical model that combines actual COVID-19 mortality counts with Bayesian inference to forecast COVID-19 deaths, the date of peak deaths, and the duration of excess mortality. The analyses covered a total of 700 million population above age 20 in 12 countries or regions: USA; Italy; Spain; France; UK; Iran; Belgium; a province of China (Hubei, which accounted for 90% of reported Chinese deaths); Germany; the Netherlands; Switzerland; and Canada; and six US states: New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Louisiana, California, and Washington. Results: Forecasted deaths across the 12 current high-burden countries sum 167,000 to 593,000 (median 253,000). The trajectory of US deaths (49,000-249,000 deaths; median 86,000)- over half of which are expected in states beyond the initial six states analysed in this study- will have the greatest impact on the eventual total. Mortality ranges are 25,000-109,000 (median 46,000) in the UK; 23,000-31,000 (median 26,000) in Italy; 21,000-37,000 (median 26,000) in France and 21,000-32,000 (median 25,000) in Spain. Estimates are most precise for Hubei, China, where the epidemic curve is complete, and least precise in California, where it is ongoing. New York has the highest cumulative median mortality rate per million (1135), about 12-fold that of Germany. Mortality trajectories are notably flatter in Germany, California, and Washington State, each of which took physical distancing and testing strategies seriously. Using past country-specific mortality as a guide, GCAM predicts surge capacity needs, reaching more than twice existing capacity in a number of places., In every setting, the results might be sensitive to undercounts of COVID-19 deaths, which are already apparent. Conclusion and Relevance: Mortality from COVID-19 will be substantial across many settings, even in the best case scenario. GCAM will provide continually updated and increasingly precise estimates as the pandemic progresses.","Brown, Patrick; Jha, Prabhat",,661,16

The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of COVID-19-induced home confinement on stress, attention, and lifestyle behaviours and the correlations between them. Methods: Participants included 144 students (aged 18–22 years, 62.5% female, 89.5% single). Stress, attention, and lifestyle behaviours were assessed using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), d2 test, and the Simple Lifestyle Indicator Questionnaire adapted and modified (SLIQ), respectively. Total PSS score, concentration performance (CP), errors (E), and lifestyle behaviours (e.g., diet, exercise/activity, alcohol, and smoking) before and during confinement were calculated. Results: The data showed a significant difference between before and during confinement in total PSS, CP, E, and all lifestyle behaviours (all, p < 0.05). Significant correlations existed between total PSS score, CP, E, and lifestyle behaviours (r= −87–98, all, p < 0.05). Conclusions: Home confinement has a negative effect on stress, attention, and lifestyle behaviours. This study suggests that the adoption of proper lifestyle behaviours, particularly diet, disciplined hygiene, and physical activity, boost health, psychological states, and cognitive function during COVID-19-induced confinement.","Znazen, Hela; Slimani, Maamer; Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi; Tod, David",Int J Environ Res Public Health,661,12

BACKGROUND: The Covid‐19 pandemic has caused major changes to family life. Using a natural experiment design can potentially adjudicate on former inconclusive findings about the effects of lockdown on parental functioning in vulnerable families. METHOD: Responses from parents in a sample of potentially vulnerable families in Norway were divided into a lockdown group if participating at baseline and during the initial Covid‐19 lockdown (n = 820 responses) or into a control group if participating at baseline and before lockdown (n = 1368 responses). Mixed model regression analyses were used to mimic a wait‐list design investigating direct lockdown effects on mental health, parenting stress, and three aspects of interparental conflicts, as well as moderation effects. RESULTS: The lockdown group showed significantly higher levels of parenting stress compared with the control group, but no aversive lockdown effect on mental health or destructive conflicts were found. In fact, decreased levels of verbal aggression and child involvement in conflict were found during lockdown among parents living apart. Pre‐existing financial problems and conflict levels, age of youngest child, and parent gender did not moderate the lockdown effects. CONCLUSION: The initial lockdown did not seem to adversely affect parental functioning, beyond increased parenting stress. Caution should be taken when generalizing the findings as child effects and long‐term lockdown effects were not investigated.","Helland, Maren Sand; Lyngstad, Torkild Hovde; Holt, Tonje; Larsen, Linda; Røysamb, Espen",J Marriage Fam,661,3

This study is aimed at describing the characteristics of COVID-19 patients in Wuhan. METHODS: 199 COVID-19 patients were admitted to Wuhan Red Cross Hospital in China from January 24th to March 15th. The cases were divided into diabetic and nondiabetic groups according to the history of taking antidiabetic drugs or by plasma fasting blood glucose level at admission, and the difference between groups were compared. RESULTS: Among 199 COVID-19 patients, 76 were diabetic and 123 were nondiabetic. Compared with nondiabetics, patients with diabetes had an older age, high levels of fasting plasma glucose (FPG), D-dimer, white blood cell, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and total bilirubin (TBIL), lower levels of lymphocyte, albumin and oxygen saturation (SaO(2)), and higher mortality (P < 0.05). The two groups showed no difference in clinical symptoms. Diabetes, higher level of D-dimer at admission, and lymphocyte count less than 0.6 × 10(9)/L at admission were associated with increasing odds of death. Antidiabetic drugs were associated with decreasing odds of death. Treatment with low molecular weight heparin was not related to odds of death. CONCLUSION: The mortality rate of COVID-19 patients with diabetes was significantly higher than those without diabetes. Diabetes, higher level of D-dimer, and lymphocyte count less than 0.6 × 10(9)/L at admission were the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.","Li, Guozhen; Deng, Qin; Feng, Jiali; Li, Fang; Xiong, Nian; He, Qiong",J Diabetes Res,661,33

From mid-March to early April 2020, did people judge prevention focus to be more useful than promotion focus for responding to COVID-19? Our study tested and showed support for this hypothesis with 401 American and Canadian participants, who we sampled in 100-person waves on the first 4 Thursdays of the pandemic. For this study, we developed a new measure of the judged usefulness of promotion and prevention focus. Additionally, results showed that the judged usefulness of promotion and prevention focus related positively to support of the psychological needs for autonomy and relatedness, respectively, in responding to COVID-19. Exploratory analyses showed that day-to-day differences in autonomy, competence, and relatedness support and in promotion and prevention focus tended to be small, which is notable given the large-scale changes to social distancing, employment, and media coverage of the virus during this time. Our research could be useful for crafting persuasive advocacy and narrative communications that encourage social distancing to protect others about whom people care most.","Vaughn, Leigh Ann; Garvey, Chase A.; Chalachan, Rachael D.",Front Psychol,661,16

In this retrospective study, data on bats submitted for rabies testing were analysed in order to better understand the epidemiology of EBLV-1 in bats in France and to investigate some epidemiological trends. Of the 3176 bats submitted for rabies diagnosis from 1989 to 2013, 1.96% (48/2447 analysed) were diagnosed positive. Among the twelve recognised virus species within the Lyssavirus genus, two species were isolated in France. 47 positive bats were morphologically identified as Eptesicus serotinus and were shown to be infected by both the EBLV-1a and the EBLV-1b lineages. Isolation of BBLV in Myotis nattereri was reported once in the north-east of France in 2012. The phylogenetic characterisation of all 47 French EBLV-1 isolates sampled between 1989 and 2013 and the French BBLV sample against 21 referenced partial nucleoprotein sequences confirmed the low genetic diversity of EBLV-1 despite its extensive geographical range. Statistical analysis performed on the serotine bat data collected from 1989 to 2013 showed seasonal variation of rabies occurrence with a significantly higher proportion of positive samples detected during the autumn compared to the spring and the summer period (34% of positive bats detected in autumn, 15% in summer, 13% in spring and 12% in winter). In this study, we have provided the details of the geographical distribution of EBLV-1a in the south-west of France and the north-south division of EBLV-1b with its subdivisions into three phylogenetic groups: group B1 in the north-west, group B2 in the centre and group B3 in the north-east of France.","Picard-Meyer, Evelyne; Robardet, Emmanuelle; Arthur, Laurent; Larcher, Gérald; Harbusch, Christine; Servat, Alexandre; Cliquet, Florence",PLoS One,661,5

One of the potentially beneficial tools in reducing the above-mentioned risks for overwhelming the healthcare system is telemedicine. Although the role of telemedicine and related interventions as a crisis management tool has increased, the current state of the implementation of telemedicine in surgery and surgical subspecialties has not been adequately evaluated. OBJECTIVE AND SIGNIFICANCE: The objective of this review is to screen the literature, extract expert opinions, qualitative, and quantitative data on the current use and future directions in the implementation of telemedicine in surgery and surgical subspecialties during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings would potentially help in understanding the challenges and future directions of telemedicine use in surgery. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The databases to be searched include PubMed, EMBASE, and MEDLINE (via Ovid). In addition, ClinicalTrials.gov and medRxiv.org will be searched for any ongoing and/or unpublished studies. The reference lists of articles included in the review will be screened to assess the sensitivity of the search. Literature search, quality assessment, followed by data extraction will be performed by two independent researchers. The findings of the data synthesis will be reported in diagrams, tables, and text. This review will consider reports that include expert opinions, qualitative and quantitative data on the implementation of telemedicine in surgery and surgical subspecialties (including patients with surgical disease of any age) during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, future perspectives reported based either on the evidence provided by the data or on expert opinions will be considered.

Most of the existing literature is in the form of case series or single-centre experience. In this review, we aim to summarize available literature on the clinical spectrum of COVID-19 in neonates and mothers and suggest a practical approach towards management of clinical scenarios. This review explores the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 in neonates born to mothers who were detected with the virus during the pregnancy. We conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed, Google Scholar and Cochrane Database of Systematic Review between November 2019 and June 2020 and screened articles related to perinatal COVID-19. This review included 786 mothers, among which 64% (504) were delivered by caesarian section. There were 3 still births and 107 (14%) were delivered preterm. Out of 793 neonates born, 629 neonates (79%) were tested after birth. The commonest symptom in neonates was respiratory distress. Respiratory support was needed in 60 neonates (7.6%), with 14 babies needing mechanical ventilation (1.8%), 25 needing non-invasive ventilation and 21 needing nasal oxygen. Only 35 of the 629 tested neonates (5.5%) were positive for COVID-19. Of the 35 positive neonates, 14 (40%) were symptomatic. The COVID-19 seems to have favourable neonatal outcomes.

However, the previously developed methods were optimized for nonenveloped viruses. Few studies evaluated if the methods are applicable to the efficient recovery of enveloped viruses from various types of raw sewage. This study aims (1) to compare the whole process recovery of Pseudomonas phage φ6, a surrogate for enveloped viruses, among combinations of primary concentration [ultrafiltration (UF), electronegative membrane vortex (EMV), and polyethylene glycol precipitation (PEG)] and RNA extraction methods (spin column-based method using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit and acid guanidinium thiocyanate–phenol–chloroform extraction using TRIzol reagent) for three types of raw sewage and (2) to test the applicability of the method providing the highest φ6 recovery to the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Among the tested combinations, PEG+TRIzol provided the highest φ6 recovery ratio of 29.8% to 49.8% (geometric mean). UF+QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit provided the second highest φ6 recovery of 6.4% to 35.8%. The comparable φ6 recovery was observed for UF+TRIzol (13.8 – 30.0 %). PEG+QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit provided only 1.4% to 3.0% of φ6 recovery, while coliphage MS2, a surrogate for nonenveloped viruses, was recovered comparably with PEG+TRIzol. This indicated that the nonenveloped surrogate (MS2) did not necessarily validate the efficient recovery for enveloped viruses. EMV+QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit provided significantly different φ6 recovery (1.6 – 21 %) among the types of raw sewage. Then, the applicability of modified PEG+TRIzol was examined for the raw sewage collected in Tokyo, Japan. Of the 12 grab samples, 4 were positive for SARS-CoV-2 CDC N1 and N3 assay. Consequently, PEG+TRIzol provided the highest φ6 recovery and allowed for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from raw sewage.","Torii, Shotaro; Furumai, Hiroaki; Katayama, Hiroyuki",Sci Total Environ,661,27

The ProPac-COVID trial evaluates whether combination therapy with macrolide azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine via anti-inflammation/immune modulation, antiviral efficacy, and pre-emptive treatment of supra-infections can shorten hospitalization duration and reduce the risk of non-invasive ventilation, treatment in the intensive care unit, and death in patients with acute hospital admission and a positive test for 2019-nCoV and symptoms of COVID-19 disease. METHODS: The ProPAC-COVID is a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical trial. The primary outcome is number of days spent alive and out of hospital within 14 days from randomization. Randomization will be in blocks of unknown size, and the final allocation will be stratified for age, site of recruitment, and whether the patient has any chronic lung diseases. Data is analyzed using intention-to-treat (ITT) principles, and main analyses will also be subject to modified ITT analysis and per protocol analysis. DISCUSSION: This paper describes the detailed statistical analysis plan for the evaluation of primary and secondary endpoints of the ProPAC-COVID study.

This work uses Randic's star networks in order to convert the protein primary structure data in specific topological indices that are used to construct a natural/random protein classification model. The set of natural proteins contains 1046 protein chains selected from the pre-compiled CulledPDB list from PISCES Dunbrack's Web Lab. This set is characterized by a protein homology of 20%, a structure resolution of 1.6 Å and R-factor lower than 25%. The set of random amino acid chains contains 1046 sequences which were generated by Python script according to the same type of residues and average chain length found in the natural set. A new Sequence to Star Networks (S2SNet) wxPython GUI application (with a Graphviz graphics back-end) was designed by our group in order to transform any character sequence in the following star network topological indices: Shannon entropy of Markov matrices, trace of connectivity matrices, Harary number, Wiener index, Gutman index, Schultz index, Moreau–Broto indices, Balaban distance connectivity index, Kier–Hall connectivity indices and Randic connectivity index. The model was constructed with the General Discriminant Analysis methods from STATISTICA package and gave training/predicting set accuracies of 90.77% for the forward stepwise model type. In conclusion, this study extends for the first time the classical TIs to protein star network TIs by proposing a model that can predict if a protein/fragment of protein is natural or random using only the amino acid sequence data. This classification can be used in the studies of the protein functions by changing some fragments with random amino acid sequences or to detect the fake amino acid sequences or the errors in proteins. These results promote the use of the S2SNet application not only for protein structure analysis but also for mass spectroscopy, clinical proteomics and imaging, or DNA/RNA structure analysis.","Munteanu, Cristian Robert; González-Díaz, Humberto; Borges, Fernanda; de Magalhães, Alexandre Lopes",J Theor Biol,661,22

Furthermore, being forced into remote learning due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, there is an urgent need for innovative learning methods. From our perspective, a learning platform should be reconfigurable to accommodate multiple applications and remotely accessible at any time, from anywhere, and on any connected device. Considering that many of the university courses are now held online, the reliability and scalability of the system become critical. This paper presents the design and development of a wireless configurable myRIO-based sensor node that connects to SystemLink Cloud. The sensors that were used are for ambient light, temperature, and proximity. A graphical programming environment (G-LabVIEW) and related APIs were used for rapid concept-to-development process. Distinct applications have been developed for the instructor and students, respectively. The students can select which sensor and application to run on the system and observe the measurements on the local student’s application or the cloud platform at a specific moment. They can also read the data on the cloud platform and use them in their LabVIEW application. In the context of remote education, we strongly believe that this platform is and will be suitable for the COVID and Post-COVID eras as well because it creates a much better remote laboratory experience for students. In conclusion, the system that was developed is innovative because it is software reconfigurable from the device, from the instructor’s application and cloud via a web browser, it is intuitive, and it has a user-friendly interface. It meets most of the necessary requirements in the current era, being also highly available and scalable in the cloud.","Chamunorwa, Tinashe; Modran, Horia Alexandru; Ursuțiu, Doru; Samoilă, Cornel; Hedeșiu, Horia",Sensors (Basel),661,16

OBJECTIVES: To examine trends in the number of hospital admissions for care home residents during the first months of the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of a national linked dataset on hospital admissions for residential and nursing home residents in England (257,843 residents, 45% in nursing homes) between 20 January 2020 and 28 June 2020, compared to admissions during the corresponding period in 2019 (252,432 residents, 45% in nursing homes). Elective and emergency admission rates, normalised to the time spent in care homes across all residents, were derived across the first three months of the pandemic between 1 March and 31 May 2020 and primary admission reasons for this period were compared across years. RESULTS: Hospital admission rates rapidly declined during early March 2020 and remained substantially lower than in 2019 until the end of June. Between March and May, 2,960 admissions from residential homes (16.2%) and 3,295 admissions from nursing homes (23.7%) were for suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Rates of other emergency admissions decreased by 36% for residential and by 38% for nursing home residents (13,191 fewer admissions in total). Emergency admissions for acute coronary syndromes fell by 43% and 29% (105 fewer admission) and emergency admissions for stroke fell by 17% and 25% (128 fewer admissions) for residential and nursing home residents, respectively. Elective admission rates declined by 64% for residential and by 61% for nursing home residents (3,762 fewer admissions). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study showing that care home residents’ hospital use declined during the first wave of COVID-19, potentially resulting in substantial unmet health need that will need to be addressed alongside ongoing pressures from COVID-19.","Grimm, Fiona; Hodgson, Karen; Brine, Richard; Deeny, Sarah R",International Journal of Population Data Science,661,1

Elevated temperatures lead to rising sea and carbon dioxide levels, changing environments and interactions between humans and other species. These changes have led to the emergence and reemergence of infectious pathogens that have already developed significant antimicrobial resistance. Although these new infectious pathogens are alarming, we can still reduce the burden of infectious diseases in the era of climate change if we focus on One Health strategies. This approach aims at the simultaneous protection of humans, animals and environment from climate change and antimicrobial impacts.

High frequency of somatic integration of the RNA virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into the DNA of infected cells was recently suggested, partly based on the detection of chimeric RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) reads between SARS-CoV-2 RNA and RNA transcribed from human host DNA. Here, we examined the possible origin of human-SARS-CoV-2 chimeric reads in RNA-seq libraries and provide alternative explanations for their origin. Chimeric reads were frequently detected also between SARS-CoV-2 RNA and RNA transcribed from mitochondrial DNA or episomal adenoviral DNA present in transfected cell lines, which was unlikely the result of SARS-CoV-2 integration. Furthermore, chimeric reads between SARS-CoV-2 RNA and RNA transcribed from nuclear DNA was highly enriched for host exonic, than intronic or intergenic sequences and often involved the same, highly expressed host genes. These findings suggest that human-SARS-CoV-2 chimeric reads found in RNA-seq data may arise during library preparation and do not necessarily signify SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription, integration in to host DNA and further transcription.","Kazachenka, Anastasiya; Kassiotis, George",bioRxiv,661,17

While some specialties are well suited to virtual care, Otolaryngology – Head and Neck Surgery could be limited due to reliance on physical examination and nasal endoscopy, including Rhinology. It is likely virtual care will remain integrated for the foreseeable future and it is important to determine the strengths and weaknesses of this treatment modality for rhinology. METHODS: A survey on virtual care in rhinology was distributed to 61 Canadian rhinologists. The primary objective was to determine how virtual care compared to in-person care in each area of a typical appointment. Other areas focused on platforms used to deliver virtual care and which patients could be appropriately assessed by virtual visits. RESULTS: 43 participants responded (response rate 70.5%). The majority of participants use the telephone as their primary platform. History taking and reviewing results (lab work, imaging) were reported to be equivalent in virtual care. Non-urgent follow up and new patients were thought to be the most appropriate for virtual care. The inability to perform exams and nasal endoscopy were reported to be significant limitations. CONCLUSION: It is important to understand the strengths and limitations of virtual care. These results identify the perceived strengths and weaknesses of virtual care in rhinology, and will help rhinologists understand the role of virtual care in their practices.

Most of these visualizations lack reproducibility, credibility, or accuracy, and are static, which makes it difficult to analyze the spread over time. Furthermore, most current visualizations depicting the spread of COVID-19 are at a global or country level, meaning there is a dearth of regional analysis within a country. Keeping these issues in mind, a replicable, efficient, and simple method to generate regional COVID-19 visualizations mapped with time was created by using the KNIME software, an open-source data analytics platform that can create user-friendly applications or workflows. For this analysis, Albania, Sweden, Ukraine, Denmark, Russia, India, and Australia were closely observed. Among the maps generated for the aforementioned countries, it was noticed that regions with a high population or high population density were often the epicenters within their respective country. The regions caused the virus to spread to their neighboring regions: kickstarting the “domino effect”, leading to the infection of another region until the country is overwhelmed with cases—what we call a proximity trend. These dynamic maps are crucial to fighting the pandemic because they can provide insight as to how COVID-19 spreads by providing researchers or officials with an accurate and insightful tool to aid their analysis. By being able to visualize the spread, health and government officials can dive deeper to identify the sources of transmission and attempt to stop or reverse them accordingly.","Chintala, Srikar; Dutta, Ritvik; Tadmor, Doron",Infect Genet Evol,661,16

This study aimed to investigate level of immunity in communities within this population as well as infection exposure required to achieve herd immunity. Methods: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was assessed in ten CMW communities between June 21 and September 9, 2020. PCR positivity, infection positivity (antibody and/or PCR positive), and infection severity rate were also estimated. Associations with anti-SARS-CoV-2 positivity were investigated using regression analyses. Results: Study included 4,970 CMWs who were mostly men (95.0%) and <40 years of age (71.5%). Seropositivity ranged from 54.9% (95% CI: 50.2-59.4%) to 83.8% (95% CI: 79.1-87.7%) in the different CMW communities. Pooled mean seropositivity across all communities was 66.1% (95% CI: 61.5-70.6%). PCR positivity ranged from 0.0% to 10.5% (95% CI: 7.4-14.8%) in the different CMW communities. Pooled mean PCR positivity was 3.9% (95% CI: 1.6-6.9%). Median cycle threshold (Ct) value was 34.0 (range: 15.8-37.4). The majority (79.5%) of PCR-positive individuals had Ct value >30 indicative of earlier rather than recent infection. Infection positivity (antibody and/or PCR positive) ranged from 62.5% (95% CI: 58.3-66.7%) to 83.8% (95% CI: 79.1-87.7%) in the different CMW communities. Pooled mean infection positivity was 69.5% (95% CI: 62.8-75.9%). Only five infections were ever severe and one was ever critical, an infection severity rate of 0.2% (95% CI: 0.1-0.4%). Conclusions: Based on an extended range of epidemiological measures, active infection is rare in these communities with limited if any sustainable infection transmission for clusters to occur.

In lieu of preparing vaccine in animal skin (the original method), we cloned vaccinia virus (New York City Board of Health strain, Dryvax(®)) by plaque purification and amplified the clone in cell culture. The overarching goal was to produce a modern vaccine that was equivalent to the currently licensed Dryvax(®) in its preclinical and clinical properties, and could thus reliably protect humans against smallpox. A variety of clones were evaluated, and many were unacceptably virulent in animal models. One clonal virus (ACAM1000) was selected and produced at clinical grade in MRC-5 human diploid cells. ACAM1000 was comparable to Dryvax(®) in immunogenicity and protective activity but was less neurovirulent for mice and nonhuman primates. To meet requirements for large quantities of vaccine after the events of September 11th 2001, the ACAM1000 master virus seed was used to prepare vaccine (designated ACAM2000) at large scale in Vero cells under serum-free conditions. The genomes of ACAM1000 and ACAM2000 had identical nucleotide sequences, and the vaccines had comparable biological phenotypes. ACAM1000 and ACAM2000 were evaluated in three Phase 1 clinical trials.

OBJECTIVE: The overarching goal of this study was to understand and conceptualize virtual community inclusion of individuals with serious mental illness (SMI). Specific objectives of this study were as follows: (1) mapping the prevalence, trends, and experiences related to mHealth and digital technology use among individuals with SMI; (2) comparing patterns of technology use by individuals with and those without SMI; and (3) examining whether use of mHealth and digital technologies predicts recovery among individuals with SMI. METHODS: A web-based survey of technology use and virtual participation was developed and distributed among adults with and those without SMI via social media, national email discussion lists, nonprofit organizations, and advocacy groups. RESULTS: A total of 381 adults aged 18 years or older participated in the survey, of whom 199 (52%) identified as having a SMI. Participants with SMI reported significantly greater access to technology and significantly fewer days of face-to-face participation in community activities than those without SMI. Among participants with SMI, greater technology use was positively associated with positive emotions and significantly predicted recovery. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to explore, map, and conceptualize virtual community inclusion among adults with SMI.

The development of monoclonal antibodies against HER2 has revolutionized the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. The humanized monoclonal antibody, trastuzumab, was the first in its class to be widely adopted. It was initially studied in the metastatic setting and then in the treatment of early-stage disease, demonstrating significant improvement in overall survival in both settings. The addition of pertuzumab further improved upon results achieved with trastuzumab and chemotherapy, specifically extending overall survival in patients with metastatic disease, lessening the risk of recurrence when used in the adjuvant setting, and improving pathologic complete response rate when utilized in the neoadjuvant setting. In this article, we review the studies that support the use of HER2-directed monoclonal antibodies in early-stage breast cancer both in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings and focus on the success of dual HER2-targeted therapy achieved with the combination of trastuzumab and pertuzumab.

A regulatory agency-approved vaccine is not available, and existing prophylaxis and therapies are limited to use in high-risk pediatric patients; thus additional therapies are sorely needed. Here, we identify a series of benzimidazole analogs that inhibit hRSV infection in vitro with high potency, using a previously-reported high-throughput screening assay. The lead compound, SRI 29365 (1-[6-(2-furyl)[1,2,4]triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4]thiadiazol-3-yl]methyl-1H-benzimidazole), has an EC50 of 66μM and a selectivity >50. We identified additional compounds with varying potencies by testing commercially-available chemical analogs. Time-of-addition experiments indicated that SRI 29365 effectively inhibits viral replication only if present during the early stages of viral infection. We isolated a virus with resistance to SRI 29365 and identified mutations in the transmembrane domain of the viral G protein genomic sequence that suggested that the compound inhibits G-protein mediated attachment of hRSV to cells. Additional experiments with multiple cell types indicated that SRI 29365 antiviral activity correlates with the binding of cell surface heparin by full-length G protein. Lastly, SRI 29365 did not reduce hRSV titers or morbidity/mortality in efficacy studies using a cotton rat model. Although SRI 29365 and analogs inhibit hRSV replication in vitro, this work suggests that the G-protein may not be a valid drug target in vivo.","Evans, Carrie W.; Atkins, Colm; Pathak, Ashish; Gilbert, Brian E.; Noah, James W.",Antiviral Research,661,3

Many studies report short-term (3–12 months) results for blood pressure and arterial stiffness. The primary endpoints were changes in 24 h mean systolic blood pressure (BP) and office systolic BP 48 months after RDN. The secondary endpoints were changes in aortic pulse wave velocity and impact of polypharmacy on these variables. Materials and Methods: Renal artery denervation was performed in 73 patients treated for resistant hypertension; 49 patients remained in final analysis. Patient examination was carried out before the procedure, and subsequently at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 months later. Patients’ antihypertensive and overall medication regimens were carefully analysed. Results: Mean 24 h arterial blood pressure lowered and was sustained at lower levels for up to 48 months; median (interequartile range—IQR) from 158(23.5)/100(14.2) to 140(26.5)/86(16.2) mmHg. Mean reduction in 24 h ambulatory systolic BP was −11 ± 25 mmHg (95% CI, −20 to −2; p < 0.001), while office systolic BP reduced by −7 ± 23 mmHg (95%CI, −24 to −1; p < 0.02).

After 48 months, there was no worsening compared to the baseline level of 10.3 [4.0] m/s (95% CI 6.9 to 17.8) (p > 0.05). The total mean number of antihypertensive drugs remained unchanged: 5.97(±1.1) vs. 5.24 (±1.45).

Researchers need to have a meta-research understanding of the quality of scientific events to publish in high-quality venues. However, there are many diverse and complex criteria to be explored for the evaluation of events. Thus, finding events with quality-related criteria becomes a time-consuming task for researchers and often results in an experience-based subjective evaluation.

The following results were obtained: 1) 75% alcohol as a disinfectant for 60 s had a preferable antibacterial effect and promoted the hatching rate; 2) densities of 300 and 600 eggs/incubator resulted in significantly higher hatching and survival rates than a density of 900 eggs/incubator; 3) at a density of 600 eggs/incubator, the optimum number of net pieces for attachment of freshly hatched juveniles was 20 per incubator; 4) with a density of 600 eggs/incubator and 20 net pieces/incubator, the hatching rate was 82.05% ± 4.09%, the survival rate was 55.12% ± 7.51%, and a total of 129,200 SPF (specific pathogen-free) seedlings were cultivated. This artificial incubation system was maintained at close to an aseptic state, with an absence of white spot virus, iridovirus, Vibrio and ciliates; this was true for all water sources used and for incubation of both eggs and juvenile crayfish. In conclusion, if we implement reasonable methods of disinfection, SPF detection and pathogen isolation and utilize optimal egg densities and incubation systems, large-scale production of SPF seedlings of Cherax quadricarinatus is possible.","Shun, Cheng; Yong-yi, Jia; Mei-li, Chi; Shi-li, Liu; Jian-bo, Zheng; Dan-li, Wang; Zhi-min, Gu",Aquaculture,661,1

The United Kingdom Research study into Ethnicity And COVID-19 outcomes in Healthcare workers (UK-REACH) project has been initiated to generate rapid evidence on whether and why ethnicity affects COVID-19 diagnosis and clinical outcomes in healthcare workers (HCWs) in the UK, through five interlinked work packages/work streams, three of which form the basis of this protocol. The ethico-legal work (Work Package 3) aims to understand and address legal, ethical and acceptability issues around big data research; the HCWs' experiences study (Work Package 4) explores their work and personal experiences, perceptions of risk, support and coping mechanisms; the stakeholder engagement work (Work Package 5) aims to provide feedback and support with the formulation and dissemination of the project recommendations. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Work Package 3 has two different research strands: (A) desk-based doctrinal research; and (B) empirical qualitative research with key opinion leaders. For the empirical research, in-depth interviews will be conducted digitally and recorded with participants’ permission. Recordings will be transcribed, coded and analysed using thematic analysis. In Work Package 4, online in-depth interviews and focus groups will be conducted with approximately 150 HCWs, from across the UK, and these will be recorded with participants’ consent. The recordings will be transcribed and coded and data will be analysed using thematic analysis. Work Package 5 will achieve its objectives through regular group meetings and in-group discussions. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been received from the London-Brighton & Sussex Research Ethics Committee of the Health Research Authority (Ref No 20/HRA/4718).

The variation in sensitivity of different diagnostic tests at different stages of infection has not been well documented. METHODS: This is a longitudinal study of 43 adults newly infected with SARS-CoV-2. All participants provided daily samples for saliva and nasal swab RTqPCR, Quidel SARS Sofia antigen FIA, and live virus culture. RESULTS: We show that both RTqPCR and the Quidel SARS Sofia antigen FIA peak in sensitivity during the period in which live virus is detected in nasal swabs, but the sensitivity of RTqPCR tests rises more rapidly prior to this period. We also estimate the sensitivities of RTqPCR and antigen tests as a function of testing frequency. CONCLUSIONS: RTqPCR tests are more effective than antigen tests at identifying infected individuals prior to or early during the infectious period and thus for minimizing forward transmission (given timely results reporting). All tests showed >98% sensitivity for identifying infected individuals if used at least every three days. Daily screening using antigen tests can achieve ~90% sensitivity for identifying infected individuals while they are viral culture positive.","Smith, Rebecca L; Gibson, Laura L; Martinez, Pamela P; Ke, Ruian; Mirza, Agha; Conte, Madison; Gallagher, Nicholas; Conte, Abigail; Wang, Leyi; Fredrickson, Richard; Edmonson, Darci C; Baughman, Melinda E; Chiu, Karen K; Choi, Hannah; Jensen, Tor W; Scardina, Kevin R; Bradley, Shannon; Gloss, Stacy L; Reinhart, Crystal; Yedetore, Jagadeesh; Owens, Alyssa N; Broach, John; Barton, Bruce; Lazar, Peter; Henness, Darcy; Young, Todd; Dunnett, Alastair; Robinson, Matthew L; Mostafa, Heba H; Pekosz, Andrew; Manabe, Yukari C; Heetderks, William J; McManus, David D; Brooke, Christopher B",J. infect. dis,661,16

We compare 2019 to 2020 to evaluate how trauma encounters has changed during the pandemic. METHODS: Retrospective analysis using a large US health care system to compare trauma demographics, volumes, mechanisms of injury, and outcomes. Statistical analysis was used to evaluate for significant differences comparing 2019 to 2020. RESULTS: Data was collected from 88 hospitals across 18 states. 169 892 patients were included in the study. There were 6.3% fewer trauma patient encounters in 2020 compared to 2019. Mechanism of injury was significantly different between 2019 and 2020 with less blunt injuries (89.64% vs. 88.39%, P < .001), more burn injuries (1.84% vs. 2.00%, P = .021), and more penetrating injuries (8.58% vs. 9.75%, P < .001).

Letters are the shortest manuscript for medical students to publish and medical-education journals are best suited. The UK Foundation Programme rewards medical students achieving PubMed ID publications and we hypothesise that this is a main motivation for medical students to submit Letters to the Editor. A review of 15 medical-education journals with an impact factor was conducted to identify numbers and percentages of Letters to the Editor by medical students between July 2018 and June 2020. Affiliation of medical students was collected. Our results show over two years, 299 letters were published by medical students equating to 45.9% of total letters. There was a 60% overall increase in letters by medical students published in the first 12 months compared to second 12 months. During this period overall numbers of letters published increased by 27%. 86% of the letters published by medical students over the two-year period were from UK medical schools. Five schools accounted for 60.5% of these letters. The three medical schools with highest numbers of letters published were King’s College London, Imperial College London and University of Oxford for both 2018/19 and 2019/20. The increase in letters published overall with greater numbers published by students, may indicate greater awareness of Letters to the Editor as means of dissemination amongst medical students. UK medical schools published large numbers of letters, perhaps reflecting increasing importance to students of publications due to impacting on subsequent jobs. Results from our quantitative research revealing: large numbers of letters by medical students, increase in letters published from 2018/19 to 2019/20 and overrepresentation of UK medical students supports the hypothesis that medical students are publishing letters to achieve PubMed IDs. Further qualitative research is required to test our hypothesis.","Mukhammadaminov, Anvarjon; Rampes, Sanketh; Divecha, Yasmin Amy; Leeves, Laura; Hammond, David; Alam, Azeem; Hearn, Russell",Medical education online,661,20

Increasingly, remote health services are reliant on short-term or ‘fly-in, fly-out/drive-in, drive-out’ health workforce to deliver primary healthcare. A key strategy to achieving health service access equity, particularly evident in remote Australia, has been the development of Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services (ACCHSs). This study aims to generate new knowledge about (1) the impact of short-term staffing in remote and rural ACCHSs on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities; (2) the potential mitigating effect of community control; and (3) effective, context-specific evidence-based retention strategies. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This paper describes a 3-year, mixed methods study involving 12 ACCHSs across three states. The methods are situated within an evidence-based programme logic framework for rural and remote primary healthcare services. Quantitative data will be used to describe staffing stability and turnover, with multiple regression analyses to determine associations between independent variables (population size, geographical remoteness, resident staff turnover and socioeconomic status) and dependent variables related to patient care, service cost, quality and effectiveness. Qualitative assessment will include interviews and focus groups with clinical staff, clinic users, regionally-based retrieval staff and representatives of jurisdictional peak bodies for the ACCHS sector, to understand the impact of short-term staff on quality and continuity of patient care, as well as satisfaction and acceptability of services.

All the patients with laboratory-confirmed severe COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to the ICU of Tenon University-teaching hospital, from February 22 to May 7th, 2020 were included. Respiratory tract specimens were obtained within the first 48 h of ICU admission. During the study period, 101 patients were referred to the ICU for COVID-19 with severe pneumonia. Most patients (n = 83; 82.2%) were intubated and mechanically ventilated on ICU admission. Overall, 20 (19.8%) respiratory tract specimens obtained within the first 48 h. Staphylococcus aureus was the main pathogen identified, accounting for almost half of the early-onset bacterial etiologies. We found a high prevalence of early-onset bacterial coinfection during severe COVID-19 pneumonia, with a high proportion of S. aureus.

Few prior studies have evaluated the well‐being of or changes to training for American resident physicians during the COVID‐19 pandemic. We aim to study predictors of trainee well‐being and changes to clinical practice using an anonymous survey of American urology residents. METHODS: An anonymous, voluntary, 47‐question survey was sent to all ACGME‐accredited urology programs in the United States. We executed a cross‐sectional analysis evaluating risk factors of perception of anxiety and depression both at work and home and educational outcomes. Multiple linear regressions models were used to estimate beta coefficients and 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Among approximately 1,800 urology residents in the USA, 356 (20%) responded. Among these respondents, 24 had missing data leaving a sample size of 332. Important risk factors of mental health outcomes included perception of access to PPE, local COVID‐19 severity, and perception of susceptible household members. Risk factors for declination of redeployment included current redeployment, having children, and concerns regarding ability to reach case minimums. Risk factors for concern of achieving operative autonomy included cancellation of elective cases and higher level of training. CONCLUSIONS: Several potential actions, which could be taken by urology residency program directors and hospital administration, may optimize urology resident well‐being, morale, and education. These include advocating for adequate access to PPE, providing support at both the residency program and institutional levels, instituting telehealth education programs, and fostering a sense of shared responsibility of COVID‐19 patients.","Khusid, Johnathan A.; Weinstein, Corey S.; Becerra, Adan Z.; Kashani, Mahyar; Robins, Dennis J.; Fink, Lauren E.; Smith, Matthew T.; Weiss, Jeffrey P.",Int J Clin Pract,661,28

The limited data available indicates that COVID-19 should be referred to as a gerolavic (from Greek, géros “old man” and epilavís, “harmful”) infection because the infection rates, severity, and lethality are substantially higher in the population aged 60 and older. This is primarily due to comorbidity but may be partially due to immunosenescence, decreased immune function in the elderly, and general loss of function, fitness, and increased frailty associated with aging. Immunosenescence is a major factor affecting vaccination response, as well as the severity and lethality of infectious diseases. While vaccination reduces infection rates, and therapeutic interventions reduce the severity and lethality of infections, these interventions have limitations. Previous studies showed that postulated geroprotectors, such as sirolimus (rapamycin) and its close derivative rapalog everolimus (RAD001), decreased infection rates in a small sample of elderly patients. This article presents a review of the limited literature available on geroprotective and senoremediative interventions that may be investigated to decrease the disease burden of gerolavic infections. This article also highlights a need for rigorous clinical validation of deep aging clocks as surrogate markers of biological age. These could be used to assess the need for, and efficacy of, geroprotective and senoremediative interventions and provide better protection for elderly populations from gerolavic infections.

Upon review of the literature there are only a few cases reported of acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) in COVID‐19 patients after treatment. Therefore, we are reporting a case of a 34-year-old male not known to have any chronic illness. His severe COVID-19 infection resolved four days prior to presentation to the Emergency Department with pustular rash on erythematous base over his face, neck, upper limbs, anterior and posterior trunk including oral cavity and tounge. The rash started after he took azithromycin, oseltamivir, ribavirin, lopinavir, hydroxychloroquine, prednisolone, ceftriaxone, clindamycin, interferon (IFN) beta, and ceftazidime for COVID-19. Skin punch biopsy was done and he was diagnosed with AGEP but it was still not known if it was related to COVID-19 or a drug-induced condition. Patient was treated with betamethasone valerate 0.1% ointment and lotion, promethazine hydrochloride 25mg tablet, paracetamol 500mg tablet, calcipotriol 50mcg/g and betamethasone 0.5mg/g gel.

In the end, we found only a few studies that describe the cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 infection, which were mainly case reports. We can’t be sure that AGEP is a late and severe complication of COVID-19 infection. However, AGEP could be a rare adverse effect of hydroxychloroquine therapy.

This condition has thus prompted prior studies and screening models that utilize D-dimer for pulmonary embolism (PE) into question. The limited research to date has failed to provide tools or guidance regarding what COVID-19 positive patients should receive pulmonary CT angiography screening. This knowledge gap has led to missed diagnoses, CT overutilization, and increased morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the utility of the quantitative D-dimer lab marker in a convenience sample of 426 COVID-19 positive patients to assist providers in determining the utility of pulmonary CT angiography. METHODS: The authors conducted a retrospective analysis on all COVID-19 positive patients within the Henry Ford Medical System between March 1st, 2020 through April 30th, 2020 who received pulmonary CT angiography and had a quantitative D-dimer lab drawn within 24 hours of CT imaging. RESULTS: Our sampling criteria yielded a total of n = 426 patients, of whom 347 (81.5%) were negative for PE and 79 (18.5%) were positive for PE. The average D-dimer in the negative PE group was 2.95 μg./mL. (SD 4.26), significantly different than the 9.15 μg./mL. (SD 6.80) positive PE group (P < 0.05; 95% CI -7.8, -4.6). Theoretically, applying the traditional ≤ 0.5 μg./mL. D-dimer cut-off to our data would yield a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 7.49% for exclusion of PE. Based on these results, the authors would be able to increase the D-dimer threshold to < 0.89 μg./mL. to maintain their sensitivity to 100% and raise the specificity to 27.95%. Observing a D-dimer cut-off value of ≤ 1.28 μg./mL. would reduce sensitivity to 97.47% but increase the specificity to 57.93%. CONCLUSIONS: These study results support the utilization of alternative D-dimer thresholds to exclude PE in COVID-19 patients. Based on these findings, providers may be able to observe increased D-dimer cut-off values to reduce unnecessary pulmonary CT angiography scans.","Mikhjian, Gary; Elghoroury, Ahmad; Cronovich, Keith; Brody, Kevin; Jarski, Robert",Spartan medical research journal,661,16

There are currently more than three million diagnosed cases, constituting a pandemic which has caused a worldwide crisis. The devastating effects of this infection are due to its highly contagious nature and although mild forms predominate, in absolute values, the rates for severe forms and mortality are very high. The information on the characteristics of the infection in inflammatory bowel disease is of special interest, as these patients have higher attendance at health centres, which may increase their risk of infection. Furthermore, the treatments used to control the inflammatory activity may modify the disease course of COVID-19.

Patients with CVD are widely prescribed 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutayl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins), a class of lipid-lowering medications known for their pleiotropic anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. However, the relationship between statin use and COVID-19 outcomes is not fully understood. In this preliminary study, we explored the association between statin use and severe COVID-19 outcomes in hospitalized patients, including intensive care unit (ICU) admission, the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and in-hospital death. We performed a retrospective cohort study of 249 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 from 3 March 2020 to 10 April 2020 in Rhode Island, USA. Patient demographics, past medical history, current medications, and hospital course were recorded and analyzed. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine associations.

The regulation of UPR upon HSV-1 infection is complex, and the downstream effectors can be detrimental to viral replication. Therefore, HSV-1 copes with the UPR to create a beneficial environment for its replication. UPR has three branches, including protein kinase RNA (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), and activated transcription factor 6 (ATF6). IRE1α is the most conserved branch of UPR which has both RNase and kinase activities. Previous studies have shown that IRE1α RNase activity was inactivated during HSV-1 infection. However, the effect of the two activities of IRE1α on HSV-1 replication remains unknown. Results in this study showed that IRE1α expression was up-regulated during HSV-1 infection. We found that in HEC-1-A cells, increasing RNase activity, or inhibiting kinase activity of IRE1α led to viral suppression, indicating that the kinase activity of IRE1α was beneficial, while the RNase activity was detrimental to viral replication. Further evidence showed that the kinase activity of IRE1α leads to the activation of the JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinases) pathway, which enhances viral replication. Taken together, our evidence suggests that IRE1α is involved in HSV-1 replication, and its RNase and kinase activities play differential roles during viral infection.","Su, Airong; Wang, Huanru; Li, Yanlei; Wang, Xiaohui; Chen, Deyan; Wu, Zhiwei",Viruses,661,20

We obtain the existence and stability criteria for the equilibrium points. We observe that when the reproduction number is less than unity, the disease-free equilibrium always exists and is locally asymptotically stable. The multiple endemic equilibrium points can exist independent of the basic reproduction number, and the system may experience bistability. We find that the system can encounter backward or forward bifurcation at [Formula: see text] , where the contact rate [Formula: see text] is the bifurcation parameter. Therefore, the disease-free equilibrium may not be globally stable. We deduce the criteria for the presence of Hopf bifurcation where the parameter [Formula: see text] acts as the bifurcation parameter and the system is a neutrally stable center. We also observe with the aid of a numerical example that a slight perturbation disrupts the neutral stability and the trajectories become either converging or diverging from the equilibrium point. Numerical simulation is performed with the help of MATLAB to justify the findings. We study the effect of nonlinearity of immunity function and the treatment rate on the dynamics of the disease spread. We find that when both are linear, the reproduction number is the same, but the system has a unique endemic equilibrium point that exists for reproduction number greater than unity. We find that there is neither backward bifurcation nor Hopf bifurcation. We also observe that the saturation in treatment enlarges the domain of backward bifurcation making disease eradication an extremely difficult task. The endemic equilibria in the case of saturated treatment may exist far more to the left of the bifurcation parameter [Formula: see text] . Hence, the nonlinearity of immunity function and treatment function affects the dynamics of an SEIS model highly; therefore, one must be precautious to choose an appropriate function for both while modeling.","Jain, Shikha; Kumar, Sachin",Eur Phys J Plus,661,9

In a sample of 76 undergraduate women who self-reported on abuse experiences, thought control strategies, and current trauma symptoms, several key findings emerged: (i) Greater severity of the CSA event was associated with greater reported use of worry and punishment strategies and less use of social control strategies; (ii) Increased use of worry and punishment strategies following the CSA event was associated with greater levels of trauma symptoms, while increased use of social control strategies following the CSA event was associated with lower levels of trauma symptoms; and (iii) Worry, punishment, and social control strategies served as mediators between CSA severity and trauma symptoms. The results suggest that thought control strategies, specifically increased worry and punishment, and decreased social control, play a vital role in understanding adjustment after CSA. Future research should examine the roles of these cognitive control strategies as possible avenues of intervention following CSA.","Scarpa, Angela; Wilson, Laura C.; Wells, Anthony O.; Patriquin, Michelle A.; Tanaka, Akiho",Behav Res Ther,661,27

Employee Assistance Programs (EAP) deliver free and confidential mental health support; however, their services are underutilised by men. In the absence of contemporary literature that explores end-user experiences of EAPs, we asked men from blue- and white-collar employment settings about the barriers and enablers to using EAP services and explored differences between employment settings. METHODS: Forty-four men participated in this qualitative study: 32 from one white-collar employer and 12 from one blue-collar employer. Two qualified mental health professionals facilitated five first-round and three second-round focus groups and one interview with white-collar workers, and two focus groups and three interviews with blue-collar workers. Data were thematically analysed using a framework approach. RESULTS: Four of the six main themes were barriers: no need for EAP—alternative supports; uncertainty of EAP services; scepticism and distrust of EAP; and societal and workplace cultures. Elements of enduring barriers to EAP use were contained within sub-themes. These included lack of knowledge about EAPs, issues of trustworthiness and confidentiality, and fear of stigma and career jeopardy. Enablers comprised the need for attractive, reliable messaging and proactive connections and service delivery. Differences within sub-themes for white-collar and blue-collar groups reflected the corporate nature of work and workplace culture for white-collar participants, and workers’ communication and practical problem resolution preferences for blue-collar workers. CONCLUSION: Some elements identified in the barriers to EAP use are more entrenched than were previously estimated and these need to be a priority for action to increase confidence in EAP services by end-users. EAPs that have a visible and proactive presence in the workplace, that tailor their marketing and service delivery to different workgroups, that provide a competitive advantage to its service users, and more confidently conveys independence from its client organisations may help to increase men’s interest in accessing EAP support services. Further initiatives that reduce the stigma surrounding mental health and help-seeking both in society and the workplace are needed.","Matthews, Lynda R.; Gerald, Jacky; Jessup, Glenda M.",Int J Ment Health Syst,661,16

There is lack of data on feasibility and safety of kidney transplants from living donors who recovered from COVID-19. METHODS. Here, we present a retrospective cohort study of 31 kidney transplant recipients (KTR) from living donors who recovered from polymerase chain reaction confirmed COVID-19 across 19 transplant centers in India from July 3, 2020, to December 5, 2020. We detailed demographics, clinical manifestations, immunosuppression regimen, treatment, and outcomes. Donors with a previous diagnosis of COVID-19 were accepted after documenting 2 negative polymerase chain reaction tests with complete symptom resolution for at least 28 days and significant social distancing for 14 days before surgery. RESULTS. COVID-19 clinical severity in donors ranged from completely asymptomatic (71%, n = 22) to mild infection (29%, n = 9). None progressed to moderate or severe stages of the disease in the entire clinical course of home treatment. Patient and graft survival was 100%, respectively, with acute cellular rejection being reported in 6.4% (n = 2) recipient. All recipients and donors were asymptomatic with normal creatinine at median follow-up of 44 days after surgery without any complications relating to surgery and COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS. Our data support safety of proceeding with living donation for asymptomatic individuals with comprehensive donor, recipients screening before surgery, using a combination of clinical, radiologic, and laboratory criteria. It could provide new insights into the management of KTR from living donors who have recovered from COVID-19 in India. To the best of our knowledge, this remains the largest cohort of KTR from living donors who recovered from COVID-19.","Kute, Vivek B.; Godara, Suraj; Guleria, Sandeep; Ray, Deepak S.; Aziz, Feroz; Hegde, Umapati; Sharma, Ashish; Nayak, K.S.; Siddini, Vishwanath; Sarkar, Piyali; Thukral, Sharmila; Mondal, Rabi Ranjan Sow; Goswami, Jitendra; Patel, Himanshu V.; Abraham M., Abi; Pathak, Vivek; Anandh, Urmila; Jha, Pranaw Kumar; Bavikar, Suhas; Bonu, Ravi Shankar; Gulati, Sanjeev; B.T., Anil Kumar; Yadav, Dinesh Kumar",Transplantation,661,17

Interestingly, numerosity discrimination thresholds also predicted and explained a specific portion of variance of formal geometrical scores. The relation between these two non-symbolic systems and formal geometry was not explained by age or verbal reasoning skills.

The virus itself may directly result in death, and patients with adrenal insufficiency, often a part of hypopituitarism, are thought to represent a particularly susceptible subgroup. Moreover, even in patients that do not contract the virus, the diversion of resources by healthcare institutions to manage the virus may indirectly result in delays in their management. To this end, the aim of this study was to determine the direct and indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with pituitary disease. METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was adopted, with all adult patients seen by our pituitary service in the year prior to the nationwide lockdown on March 23rd 2020 invited to participate in a telephone survey. RESULTS: In all, 412 patients (412/586; 70.3%) participated in the survey. 66 patients (66/412; 16.0%) reported having suspected COVID-19 infection. Of the 10 patients in this group tested for COVID-19 infection, three received a positive test result. No deaths due to COVID-19 were identified. 267 patients (267/412; 64.8%) experienced a delay or change in the planned care for their pituitary disease, with 100 patients (100/412; 24.3%) perceiving an impact to their care. CONCLUSIONS: Whilst only a small percentage of patients had confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection, over half were still indirectly impacted by the pandemic through a delay or change to their planned care.","Graf, Anneke; Marcus, Hani J.; Baldeweg, Stephanie E.",Pituitary,661,20

In nineteenth century Europe, puerperal fever (childbed fever) was a major clinical and public health problem with very high maternal mortality. It was thought to be caused by miasma, epidemicity, or the Will of Providence. Apart from bloodletting, there was no cure for it. Semmelweis cared for the childbed fever women during their illness, and when they died, he did autopsies on them. Astute clinical observations and logical reasoning goaded Semmelweis to suspect the role of “unholy” hands of “holy” physicians in the transmission of puerperal fever. He enforced a hand-washing policy for physicians. Those with unwashed hands were disallowed into labor room. The hand-washing practice for 1 year led to unprecedented decrease in maternal mortality. It enabled Semmelweis to establish a strong, specific, temporal causal association between unclean hands and puerperal fever. Although not accepted during his lifetime, this causal hypothesis contributed significantly to the understanding of etiopathophysiology of not only puerperal fever but also many other communicable diseases. Clinical hand washing, since then, has prevented millions of deaths of humankind. In the present times too, his idea of hand hygiene plays a central role in COVID-19 pandemic management. Authors present a brief account of life and work of this maverick genius, who was born “too early in the darkness.” He is also called the “Father of infection control” and “Savior of mothers.”","Tyagi, Uvi; Barwal, Kailash Chander",Indian J Surg,661,20

Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium difficile sont les plus souvent à l’origine des IAS. L’antibiorésistance fréquente complique encore la prise en charge et des impasses thérapeutiques existent à présent. Les mesures d’hygiène hospitalière bien qu’essentielles sont insuffisantes pour diminuer drastiquement les IAS. Ainsi, des stratégies alternatives à l’antibiothérapie s’avèrent nécessaires pour prévenir et traiter les IAS. Parmi celles-ci, la vaccination et l’immunisation passive sont probablement les plus prometteuses. Nous avons fait une mise au point sur les vaccins disponibles et en développement clinique pour lutter contre les IAS, chez les patients à risque d’IAS et les soignants. L’intérêt de la vaccination grippale et rotavirus chez les patients pour prévenir ces IAS virales a été examiné. Le développement d’un vaccin anti-S. aureus, déjà émaillé de 2 échecs est complexe. Toutefois, ces échecs ont permis d’améliorer les connaissances sur l’immunité anti-S. aureus. La mise à disposition d’un vaccin préventif anti-C. difficile semble plus proche. Pour les autres bactéries gram négatif responsables d’IAS, le développement est moins avancé. La vaccination des patients à risques d’IAS pose également des problèmes de réponse vaccinale qu’il faudra résoudre pour utiliser cette stratégie. Ainsi, la vaccination des soignants, de par l’effet de groupe permet également de prévenir les IAS. Nous faisons ici le point sur l’intérêt de la vaccination des soignants contre la rougeole, la coqueluche, la grippe, la varicelle, l’hépatite B pour réduire les IAS avec des vaccins déjà disponibles. Summary The burden of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) is global and major. Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium difficile are the most frequent associated pathogens. Infection control measures are crucial but not sufficient to stem the burden of HAIs. Due to antimicrobial resistance, lack of therapeutic options for treatment of totally-drug resistant organism is also observed. Therefore, alternative strategies to antimicrobial drugs are urgently needed to prevent and treat HAI. Among these strategies, vaccines and passive immunization are probably one of the most attractive. In this review, we will discuss licensed and non-licensed vaccines for HAIs at-risk patients and HCWs to prevent HAI. The benefit of Influenza and rotavirus vaccines in patients to prevent these viral IAS is reviewed. The development of an S. aureus vaccine, previously associated to failures, seem to be complicated. These failures allow however a better knowledge of S. aureus immunity. For C. difficile, the goal of obtaining a preventive vaccine seems to be near. Development of vaccines to prevent gram negative bacteria involved in IAS remain challenging and confined in early phases of development. Vaccination of at risk patients is however challenging due to the poor immune response to vaccines usually obtained. Therefore, immunization of healthcare workers (HCWs) is crucial to prevent IAS as it is associated to herd immunity. We also review here the benefit of HCWs immunization against measles, pertussis, influenza, varicella and hepatitis B to prevent HAIs.","Gagneux-Brunon, A.; Lucht, F.; Launay, O.; Berthelot, P.; Botelho-Nevers, E.",Journal des Anti-infectieux,661,23

The objective of this study was to report the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, consistent with previous infection, and to report the symptomatology of infection in children. Design This multicentre observational cohort study, conducted between 16th April - 3rd July 2020 at 5 UK sites, aimed to recruit 900 children aged 2 to 15 years of age. Participants provided blood samples for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing and data were gathered regarding unwell contacts and symptoms. Results 1007 participants were enrolled, and 992 were included in the final analysis. The median age of participants was 10.1 years. There were 68 (6.9%) participants with positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests indicative of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of these, 34/68 (50%) reported no symptoms. The presence of antibodies and the mean antibody titre was not influenced by age. Following multivariate analysis 4 independent variables were identified as significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. These were: known infected household contact; fatigue; gastrointestinal symptoms; and changes in sense of smell or taste. Discussion In this study children demonstrated similar antibody titres in response to SARS-CoV-2 irrespective of age. The symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children were subtle but of those reported, fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms and changes in sense of smell or taste were most strongly associated with antibody positivity.

METHODS: We prospectively collected data from all adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosed at the Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain. All the patients were diagnosed through nasopharyngeal swab PCR. The first surge spanned from March 1 to August 13, 2020, while surge two encompasses August 14 to December 8, 2020. RESULTS: There were 2479 and 852 patients with microbiologically proved SARS-CoV-2 infection in surge one and two, respectively. Patients from surge two were significantly younger (median age: 52 [IQR: 35] vs. 59 [40] years, respectively, P < 0.001), had fewer comorbidities (379/852, 44.5% vs. 1237/2479, 49.9%, P = 0.007), and a shorter interval between onset of symptoms-diagnosis (median: 3 [5] vs. 4 [5] days, P < 0.001). All-cause in-hospital mortality significantly decreased both for the whole population (24/852, 2.8% vs. 218/2479, 8.8%, P < 0.001) and hospitalized patients (20/302, 6.6% vs. 206/1570, 13.1%, P = 0.012). At adjusted logistic regression analysis, predictors of in-hospital mortality were older age (per year, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.079, 95% CI: 1.063-1.094), male sex (aOR 1.476, 95% CI: 1.079-2.018), having comorbidities (aOR 1.414, 95% CI: 0.934-2.141), ICU admission (aOR 3.812, 95% CI: 1.875-7.751), mechanical ventilation (aOR 2.076, 95% CI: 0.968-4.454), and COVID-19 during surge one (with respect to surge two) (aOR 2.176, CI: 95% 1.286-3.680). CONCLUSIONS: First wave SARS-CoV-2-infected patients had a more than two-fold higher in-hospital mortality than second-wave patients. The causes are likely multifactorial.","Domingo, Pere; Pomar, Virgina; Mur, Isabel; Castellví, Ivan; Corominas, Héctor; de Benito, Natividad",Clin Microbiol Infect,661,11

When we explore the different policy approaches adopted as well as the underlying socio-economic factors, we note an interesting set of correlations: countries led by women leaders have fared significantly better than those led by men on a wide range of dimensions concerning the global health crisis. In this paper, we analyze available data for 35 countries, focusing on the following variables: number of deaths per capita due to COVID-19, number of days with reported deaths, peaks in daily deaths, deaths occurred on the first day of lockdown, and excess mortality. Results show that countries governed by female leaders experienced much fewer COVID-19 deaths per capita and were more effective and rapid at flattening the epidemic's curve, with lower peaks in daily deaths. We argue that there are both contingent and structural reasons that may explain these stark differences. First of all, most women-led governments were more prompt at introducing restrictive measures in the initial phase of the epidemic, prioritizing public health over economic concerns, and more successful at eliciting collaboration from the population. Secondly, most countries led by women are also those with a stronger focus on social equality, human needs and generosity. These societies are more receptive to political agendas that place social and environmental wellbeing at the core of national policymaking.","Coscieme, L.; Fioramonti, L.; Mortensen, L.

In Studies 1 and 2 (n = 415, n = 199), those with warmer feelings toward scientists were more concerned and engaged in greater COVID‐preventative behaviors, regardless of partisanship. That is, an anti‐scientists bias was related to lessened concern and toward less preventive behaviors. Furthermore, those who were the most optimistic about hydroxychloroquine, a purported but unproven treatment against the virus, were less likely to engage in behaviors designed to decrease the spread of COVID‐19. In Study 3 (n = 259), asking participants to watch a scientist discuss hydroxychloroquine on Fox News led people to greater endorsement of COVID behaviors. In short, positive feelings toward scientists, rather than political attitudes or knowledge, related to who was concerned and those willing to engage in pandemic reducing behaviors. These behaviors were not immutable and can be changed by scientific out‐reach.","Sanchez, Carmen; Dunning, David",J Appl Soc Psychol,661,10

Endothelial VWF is stored in cell‐specific secretory granules, Weibel‐Palade bodies (WPBs), organelles generated in a wide range of lengths (0.5‐5.0 µm). WPB size responds to physiological cues and pharmacological treatment, and VWF secretion from shortened WPBs dramatically reduces platelet and plasma VWF adhesion to an endothelial surface. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that WPB‐shortening represented a novel target for antithrombotic therapy. Our objective was to determine whether compounds exhibiting this activity do exist. METHODS: Using a microscopy approach coupled to automated image analysis, we measured the size of WPB bodies in primary human endothelial cells treated with licensed compounds for 24 hours. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: A novel approach to identification of antithrombotic compounds generated a significant number of candidates with the ability to shorten WPBs. In vitro assays of two selected compounds confirm that they inhibit the pro‐hemostatic activity of secreted VWF. This set of compounds acting at a very early stage of the hemostatic process could well prove to be a useful adjunct to current antithrombotic therapeutics. Further, in the current SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic, with a considerable fraction of critically ill COVID‐19 patients affected by hypercoagulability, these WPB size‐reducing drugs might also provide welcome therapeutic leads for frontline clinicians and researchers.","Ferraro, Francesco; Patella, Francesca; Costa, Joana R.; Ketteler, Robin; Kriston‐Vizi, Janos; Cutler, Daniel F.",J Thromb Haemost,661,24

Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) is one of them and has been reported from different parts of the world in this pandemic. It is an acute post-infectious polyneuropathy. The review aims to summarize the demographic features, clinical presentation, diagnostics workup, and management strategies of COVID-19 associated GBS reported in the literature. Material and method We searched Medline, PubMed Central, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar using pre-defined keywords, with no time limits and in the English language only. We aimed to include all kinds of manuscripts. The last search was done on 18th May 2020. Demographics, clinical features, diagnostic workup, management, and outcomes were documented in the datasheet. Results We identified 24 cases of COVID-19 associated GBS. Most of the cases were reported from Italy followed by the USA. The majority were males (18 /24) The age ranged from 23 -84 years. The clinical presentation was typical sensory-motor GBS in most. Nine patients had facial palsy of which five had bilateral involvement. Two patients had bilateral abducent nerve palsy while two presented as paraparetic GBS variant with autonomic dysfunction. Electrodiagnostics was performed in 17 patients only and 12 had typical features of acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. Intravenous immunoglobulins were the preferred mode of treatment in most of the patient. There was one death, and most were discharged to rehabilitation or home. Conclusion GBS is a frequent neurological complication associated with COVID-19. There is no clear causative relationship between GBS, and COVID-19 at present, and more data are needed to establish the casualty. However, most cases have a post-infectious onset with male preponderance. Most of the cases have a typical presentation but some may present in an atypical way. Prognosis is generally good.","Ahmad, I.; Rathore, F. A.",,661,20

This analysis provides insight into the possible implications of the policy actions taken in the region. METHODS: An in-depth review and analysis of available data from the DACH countries was conducted. Data was collected from official government sources whenever possible, and supplemented by information from international databases and local reports. The data was then analyzed to identify common patterns as well as significant divergences across the DACH region, especially in the area of health policy and technology use. RESULTS: The DACH countries faced similar epidemiological situations during the Covid-19 pandemic, and were largely successful at preventing many of the negative impacts seen across the rest of Europe. Although many differences in health systems and governance structures existed, the policy responses in all three countries managed to address some of the most important factors in containing an infectious disease outbreak of this magnitude. CONCLUSIONS: The actions taken by all three DACH countries appear to have been largely successful in reducing the health impact of Covid-19, allowing a return to normal economic activities much earlier than in neighboring countries. However, the implications of certain policies related to economic resilience and health system capacity cannot yet be fully evaluated and may even prove to have negative impacts into the future.","Desson, Zachary; Lambertz, Lisa; Peters, Jan Willem; Falkenbach, Michelle; Kauer, Lukas",Health Policy Technol,661,20

We conducted a survey between February and June 2020 to evaluate the economic impact and animal health problems upon the pandemic. Participants were lead veterinarians from 14 dairy farms with herd size between 100 and 500 in Lahore. These farms were major suppliers of milk and dairy products to central Punjab, Pakistan. During the pandemic, 10 of the 14 dairy farms relied on feed mill concentrates to provide feeds to their herds. Half of the farms reported feed shortage due to lockdowns. Six (43%) dairy farms have witnessed a 7.5% shortage of dry feed intake. In seven (50%) farms, the body condition score decreased by 0.24 point. The body score reduction was significantly associated with depleted feed intake (P = 0.005). The veterinarians of 10 (71%) farms failed to gain access to essential veterinary medications, hampering the treatment of sick animals. Due to feed shortage and drug unavailability, daily milk production reduced by two litters per cow in the herd of five (35%) farms. The reduced feed intake was significantly associated with the decrease in milk production (P = 0.003), while numerous downstream milk-processing facilities were out of service during the pandemic, significantly reducing the profit of six (43%) dairy farms. Finally, our study showed that the dairy farming industry and animal welfare were critically affected by three aspects: feed shortage, inaccessibility to essential veterinary drugs, and a reduced consumer demand for dairy products.","Hussain, Sabir; Hussain, Abrar; Ho, Jeffery; Sparagano, Olivier A.

In turn, the less severe human coronaviruses such as HCoV-229E and OC43 are drawing newfound attention. These less severe coronaviruses can be used as a model to facilitate our understanding of the host immune response to coronavirus infection. SARS-CoV-2 must be handled under biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) conditions. Therefore, HCoV-229E and OC43, which can be handled at BSL-2 provide an alternative to SARS-CoV-2 for preclinical screening and designing of antivirals. However, to date, there is no published effective and efficient method to titrate HCoVs other than expensive indirect immunostaining. Here we present an improved approach using an agarose-based conventional plaque assay to titrate HCoV 229E and OC43 with mink lung epithelial cells, Mv1Lu. Our results indicate that titration of HCoV 229E and OC43 with Mv1Lu is consistent and reproducible. The titers produced are also comparable to those produced using human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells. More importantly, Mv1Lu cells display a higher tolerance for cell-cell contact stress, decreased temperature sensitivity, and a faster growth rate. We believe that our improved low-cost plaque assay can serve as an easy tool for researchers conducting HCoV research.","Bracci, Nicole; Pan, Han-Chi; Lehman, Caitlin; Kehn-Hall, Kylene; Lin, Shih-Chao",PeerJ,661,10

Several hospitals have put in place strategies to manage space, staff, and supplies in order to continue to deliver optimum care to patients while at the same time protecting the health and safety of staff and patients. However, the emergence of the second and third waves of the virus with the influx of new cases continue to add an additional level of complexity to the already challenging situation of containing the spread and lowering the rate of transmission and thus pushing healthcare systems to the limit.

Design: Observational cohort study conducted between April 17 and May 1, 2020 using a web-based questionnaire. Setting: Medical and main campuses of a university. Participants: All faculty, staff, and post-doctoral fellows. Exposures: Work factors including supervisor support and exposure to high-risk clinical settings; personal factors including demographics and family/home stressors. Main Outcomes and Measures: Stress, anxiety, depression, work exhaustion, burnout, and decreased well-being. Results: There were 5550 respondents (overall response rate of 34.3%). 38% of faculty and 14% of staff (n=915) were providing clinical care, while 57% of faculty and 77% of staff were working from home. The prevalence of anxiety, depression, and work exhaustion were somewhat higher among clinicians than non-clinicians. Among all workers, anxiety, depression, and high work exhaustion were independently associated with community or clinical exposure to COVID-19 [Prevalence Ratios and 95% confidence intervals 1.37(1.09- 1.73), 1.28(1.03 - 1.59), and 1.24(1.13 - 1.36) respectively].

Age below 40 and a greater number of family/home stressors were also associated with poorer outcomes. Among the subset of clinicians, caring for patients with COVID-19 and work in high-risk clinical settings were additional risk factors. Conclusions and Implications: Our findings suggest that the pandemic has had negative effects on mental health and well-being among both clinical and non-clinical employees.

Due to the complicated Pathogenesis, high infectivity and high fatality rate of COVID-19, there is currently no effective treatment for such epidemic disease. Traditional Chinese medicine has a long clinical history for the prevention and treatment of this kind of acute infectious disease. Qingfei Paidu Decoction (QFPD) is widely used in treating COVID-19 in China. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive and systematic evidence on the effectiveness and safety of Qingfei Paidu Decoction. METHODS: We will search each database from the built-in until May 2020. The English literature mainly searches Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science, while the Chinese literature comes from CNKI, CBM, VIP, and Wangfang database. Simultaneously we will retrieval clinical registration tests and grey literatures. This study only screen the clinical randomized controlled trials (RCTs) about QFPD for COVID-19 to assess its efficacy and safety. The two researchers worked independently on literature selection, data extraction, and quality assessment. The dichotomous data is represented by relative risk (RR), and the continuous is expressed by mean difference (MD) or standard mean difference (SMD), eventually the data is synthesized using a fixed effect model (FEM) or a random effect model (REM) depending on whether or not heterogeneity exists. Total clinical effective rate, improvement rate of lung CT, adverse events were evaluated as the main outcomes. Effective rate of clinical symptoms, treatment time were secondary outcomes. Finally, meta-analysis was conducted by RevMan software version 5.3. RESULTS: The results of our research will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.

Due to the abundant natural resources it inherits, the resultant urbanization has led to an influx of the human population. This increase in population as a result of industrialization has led to increased municipal solid waste (MSW) accumulation. To address this exigent issue, which affects the nation’s carbon footprint, it is imperative to review socio-economic and geographic factors to establish a feasible approach for managing MSW efficiently and sustainably. In the quest to achieve the same, the present assessment focuses on the 3 core waste management hierarchy systems to support sustainable development for LC by reviewing existing opportunities and challenges associated with the current MSW management system and the associated policies. The result shows that as a sustainable approach to MSW management of LC, a zero-waste campaign for resource recovery engaging all stakeholders can be implemented since the organic content of MSW generated in LC is as high as 70%. Moreover, the dumping of MSW at the dedicated dumpsite site can be minimized if policies are strengthened and the proposed waste avoidance pathway is implemented strictly. In addition to this, to avoid the contamination of groundwater and recovery of methane, the use of the Fukuoka approach in the existing landfills has been suggested to capture leachate without any huge expenditure.

Due to having vast ethnomedical experience and the richest flora (34% endemic) of Europe and the Middle East, Turkey has a high potential for research on this topic. Plants that locals have been using for centuries for the prevention and treatment of influenza can offer effective alternatives to combat this problem. In this context, 224 herbal taxa belonging to 45 families were identified among the selected 81 studies conducted in the seven regions of Turkey. However, only 35 (15.6%) of them were found to be subjected to worldwide in vitro and in vivo research conducted on anti-influenza activity. Quercetin and chlorogenic acid, the effectiveness of which has been proven many times in this context, have been recorded as the most common (7.1%) active ingredients among the other 56 active substances identified. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study has been carried out to reveal the inventory of plant species that have been used in flu treatment for centuries in Turkish folk medicine, which could be used in the treatment of flu or flu-like pandemics, such as COVID 19, that humanity has been suffering with, and also compare them with experimental studies in the literature. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The investigation was conducted in two stages on the subject above by using electronic databases, such as Web of Science, Scopus, ScienceDirect, ProQuest, Medline, Cochrane Library, EBSCO, HighWire Press, PubMed and Google Scholar. The results of both scans are presented in separate tables, together with their regional comparative analysis. RESULTS: Data obtained on taxa are presented in a table, including anti-influenza mechanism of actions and the active substances. Rosa canina (58.7%) and Mentha x piperita (22.2%) were identified as the most common plants used in Turkey. Also, Sambucus nigra (11.6%), Olea europaea (9.3%), Eucalyptus spp., Melissa officinalis, and Origanum vulgare (7.0%) emerged as the most investigated taxa. CONCLUSION: This is the first nationwide ethnomedical screening work conducted on flu treatment with plants in Turkey. Thirty-nine plants have been confirmed in the recent experimental anti-influenza research, which strongly shows that these plants are a rich pharmacological source. Also, with 189 (84.4%) taxa, detections that have not been investigated yet, they are an essential resource for both national and international pharmacological researchers in terms of new natural medicine searches. Considering that the production of antimalarial drugs and their successful use against COVID-19 has begun, this correlation was actually a positive and remarkable piece of data, since there are 15 plants, including Centaurea drabifolia subsp. Phlocosa (an endemic taxon), that were found to be used in the treatment of both flu and malaria.","Sargin, Seyid Ahmet",J Ethnopharmacol,661,1

SARS-CoV-2 causes severe inflammation, which can be fatal. Consequently, there has been a massive and rapid growth in research aimed at throwing light on the mechanisms of infection and the progression of the disease. With regard to this data science is playing a pivotal role in in silico analysis to gain insights into SARS-CoV-2 and the outbreak of COVID-19 in order to forecast, diagnose and come up with a drug to tackle the virus. The availability of large multiomics, radiological, bio-molecular and medical datasets requires the development of novel exploratory and predictive models, or the customisation of existing ones in order to fit the current problem. The high number of approaches generates the need for surveys to guide data scientists and medical practitioners in selecting the right tools to manage their clinical data. RESULTS: Focusing on data science methodologies, we conduct a detailed study on the state-of-the-art of works tackling the current pandemic scenario. We consider various current COVID-19 data analytic domains such as phylogenetic analysis, SARS-CoV-2 genome identification, protein structure prediction, host–viral protein interactomics, clinical imaging, epidemiological research and drug discovery. We highlight data types and instances, their generation pipelines and the data science models currently in use. The current study should give a detailed sketch of the road map towards handling COVID-19 like situations by leveraging data science experts in choosing the right tools. We also summarise our review focusing on prime challenges and possible future research directions.

Compassionate leadership in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic,18.120298,4.0134892,2021-10-31,"COVID-19 is a novel virus, which has a fast spreading rate, and now it is seen all around the world. The case and death numbers are increasing day by day. Some tests have been used to determine the COVID-19. Chest X-ray and chest computerized tomography (CT) are two important imaging tools for determination and monitoring of COVID-19. And new methods have been searching for determination of the COVID-19. In this paper, the investigation of various multiresolution approaches in detection of COVID-19 is carried out. Chest X-ray images are used as input to the proposed approach. As recent trend in machine learning shifts toward the deep learning, we would like to show that the traditional methods such as multiresolution approaches are still effective. To this end, the well-known multiresolution approaches namely Wavelet, Shearlet and Contourlet transforms are used to decompose the chest X-ray images and the entropy and the normalized energy approaches are employed for feature extraction from the decomposed chest X-ray images. Entropy and energy features are generally accompanied with the multiresolution approaches in texture recognition applications. The extreme learning machines (ELM) classifier is considered in the classification stage of the proposed study. A dataset containing 361 different COVID-19 chest X-ray images and 200 normal (healthy) chest X-ray images are used in the experimental works. The performance evaluation is carried out by employing various metric namely accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and precision. As deep learning is mentioned, a comparison between proposed multiresolution approaches and deep learning approaches is also carried out. To this end, deep feature extraction and fine-tuning of pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are considered. For deep feature extraction, pretrained, ResNet50 model is employed. For classification of the deep features, the Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier is used. The ResNet50 model is also used in the fine-tuning. The experimental works show that multiresolution approaches produced better performance than the deep learning approaches. Especially, Shearlet transform outperformed at all. 99.29% accuracy score is obtained by using Shearlet transform.","Ismael, Aras M.; Şengür, Abdulkadir",Health Inf Sci Syst,661,24

Recently, many countries reported their population based antibody titer study results. South Korea recently reported their third antibody formation rate, where it divided the study between the general population and the young male youths in their early twenties. As previously stated, these simple point estimates may be misinterpreted without proper estimation of standard error and confidence intervals. In this article, we provide an updated 95% confidence intervals for COVID-19 antibody formation rate for the Korean population using asymptotic, exact and Bayesian statistical estimation methods. As before, we found that the Wald method gives the narrowest interval among all asymptotic methods whereas mid p-value gives the narrowest among all exact methods and Jeffrey’s method gives the narrowest from Bayesian method. The most conservative 95% confidence interval estimation shows that as of 00:00 November 23, 2020, at least 69,524 people were infected but not confirmed. It also shows that more positive cases were found among the young male in their twenties (0.22%), three times that of the general public (0.051%). This thereby calls for the quarantine authorities’ need to strengthen quarantine managements for the early twenties in order to find the hidden infected people in the population.","Kamruzzaman, Md.; Apio, Catherine; Park, Taesung",Genomics Inform,661,3

Opioid use may contribute to dysregulated macrophage functions resulting in more severe neurocognitive symptoms in PWH taking opioids. Macroautophagy helps maintain quality control in long-lived cell types, such as macrophages, and has been shown to regulate, in part, some macrophage functions in the CNS that contribute to HAND. Using Western blotting and confocal immunofluorescence in primary human macrophages, we demonstrated that morphine and a commonly prescribed ART regimen induce bulk autophagy. Morphine and ART also inhibited completion of autophagy. HIV infection increased these inhibitory effects. We also examined two types of selective autophagy that degrade aggregated proteins (aggrephagy) and dysfunctional mitochondria (mitophagy). Morphine and ART inhibited selective autophagy mediated by p62 regardless of HIV infection, and morphine inhibited mitophagic flux in HIV-infected cells demonstrating potential mitotoxicity. These results indicate that inhibition of autophagy, both in bulk and selective, in CNS macrophages may mediate neurocognitive dysfunction in PWH using opioids. Increasing autophagic activity in the context of HIV may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for reducing HAND in these individuals.","Barbaro, John M.; Cuervo, Ana Maria; Berman, Joan W.",Cells,661,1

Examples include access to trained clinicians, the expense of treatment, geographical limitations, and personal limitations such as stigma regarding help seeking. Self-help interventions, delivered via a digital platform, have the potential to overcome treatment gaps by providing patients with standardised, evidence-based treatments that are easily accessible, cost-effective, and require minimal clinician support. Equally, it is important to examine the shortcomings of digital interventions when compared to traditional to face-to-face delivery (e.g., high dropout rates) in order to maximise the therapeutic effectiveness of online, self-help interventions. METHODS: A three-arm, multisite randomised controlled trial will be conducted in Australia examining the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a newly developed online self-help intervention, Binge Eating eTherapy (BEeT), in a sample of patients with full or sub-threshold BN. The BEeT program consists of 10, multimedia sessions delivering the core components of cognitive behaviour therapy. Eligible participants will be randomised to one of three groups: independent completion of BEeT as a purely self-help program, completion of BEeT alongside clinician support (in the form of weekly telemedicine sessions), or waitlist control. Assessments will take place at baseline, weekly, post-intervention, and three-month follow up. The primary outcome is frequency of objective binge episodes. Secondary outcomes include frequency of other core eating disorder behavioural symptoms and beliefs, psychological distress, and quality of life. Statistical analyses will examine treatment effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability and cost effectiveness. DISCUSSION: There is limited capacity within the mental health workforce in Australia to meet the demand of people seeking treatment for eating disorders. This imbalance has only worsened following outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further research is required into innovative digital modes of treatment delivery with the capacity to service mental health needs in an accessible and affordable manner. Self-help programs may also appeal to individuals who are more reluctant to engage in traditional face-to-face treatment formats. This study will provide rigorous evidence on how to diversify treatment options for individuals with BN, ensuring more people with the illness can access evidence-based treatment.

It is known that bacterial infections represent a common complication during viral respiratory tract infections such as influenza, with a concomitant increase in morbidity and mortality. Nevertheless, the prevalence of bacterial co-infections and secondary infections in critically ill patients affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not well understood yet. We performed a review of the literature currently available to examine the incidence of bacterial secondary infections acquired during hospital stay and the risk factors associated with multidrug resistance. Most of the studies, mainly retrospective and single-centered, highlighted that the incidence of co-infections is low, affecting about 3.5% of hospitalized patients, while the majority are hospital acquired infections, developed later, generally 10–15 days after ICU admission. The prolonged ICU hospitalization and the extensive use of broad-spectrum antimicrobial drugs during the COVID-19 outbreak might have contributed to the selection of pathogens with different profiles of resistance. Consequently, the reported incidence of MDR bacterial infections in critically ill COVID-19 patients is high, ranging between 32% to 50%. MDR infections are linked to a higher length of stay in ICU but not to a higher risk of death. The only risk factor independently associated with MDR secondary infections reported was invasive mechanical ventilation (OR 1.062; 95% CI 1.012–1.114), but also steroid therapy and prolonged length of ICU stay may play a pivotal role. The empiric antimicrobial therapy for a ventilated patient with suspected or proven bacterial co-infection at ICU admission should be prescribed judiciously and managed according to a stewardship program in order to interrupt or adjust it on the basis of culture results.","Pasero, Daniela; Cossu, Andrea Pasquale; Terragni, Pierpaolo",Microorganisms,661,17

First, I describe the restoration economy and give real‐world examples of how investing in restoration activities can simultaneously ease pressure on the environment and create immediate jobs and revenues. Then I suggest that to obtain political attraction, a successful restoration strategy will require a triple‐bottom‐line approach to ensure that in addition to environmental objectives, stakeholders integrate socioeconomic outcomes in decision‐making.

Findings regarding UL were categorized into (1) functionality, (2) strength, (3) spasticity. All the studies that showed significant improvements retained them in the long term. Baseline functionality may be a limiting factor in achieving motor improvements, but not in sustaining them over the long term. Conclusion: It seems that the improvements achieved during the application of tDCS combined with UL motor rehabilitation in stroke were preserved until the follow-up time (from 3 months to 1 year).

De todas formas, las complicaciones son muy frecuentes y pueden llevar a fracaso del injerto a medio y largo plazo y menor supervivencia. De acuerdo con el registro de la International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation, las tasas de supervivencia al primer, segundo y quinto año fueron, en 2006, del 74, 65 y 47%, respectivamente. El principal obstáculo para el éxito a largo plazo del trasplante de pulmón es el rechazo crónico, caracterizado histológicamente como bronquiolitis obliterante, que acontece en cerca de dos terceras partes de los pacientes. Uno de los factores más importantes para el desarrollo de bronquiolitis obliterante, además del número de rechazos agudos, es la infección y la enfermedad por citomegalovirus (CMV). Recientemente, se ha destacado el papel de la infección por diferentes virus respiratorios como factores de riesgo para el desarrollo de rechazo crónico en receptores de un trasplante de pulmón. Las complicaciones infecciosas son una causa frecuente de morbimortalidad en este tipo de pacientes, y la causa de muerte de cerca de la mitad de ellos. La infección bacteriana es la complicación más frecuente de un receptor de un trasplante de pulmón. Del total, el 35-66% son bacterianas y el 50-85% de los pacientes presentan como mínimo un episodio de infección bacteriana. La segunda causa más frecuente de infección, después de la bacteriana, es la infección por CMV. A pesar de utilizar diferentes estrategias de prevención, la incidencia sigue siendo elevada, y se sitúa alrededor del 7% el primer año postrasplante. Es el único tipo de trasplante de órgano sólido en el cual la etiología más frecuente de la infección fúngica es Aspergillus spp., a diferencia del resto, en que típicamente se deben a Candida spp. La incidencia de aspergilosis invasora se cifra en alrededor del 4%. Lung transplantation is now considered an established therapeutic option for patients with severe respiratory failure. Nevertheless, complications are frequent and can lead to intermediate- or long-term graft dysfunction and decreased survival. According to the registry of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation, survival rates in these patients at one, two, and five years are 74%, 65%, and 47%, respectively. The main obstacle to long-term success of lung transplantation, however, is chronic rejection, which is characterized histologically as bronchiolitis obliterans and occurs in up to two-thirds of patients. One of the most important risk factors for the development of bronchiolitis obliterans, in addition to the number of previous acute rejection episodes and the incidence of persistent rejection, is cytomegalovirus infection and disease. Moreover, recent evidence has indicated a role for respiratory viruses as risk factors for the development of chronic rejection in lung transplant recipients. Infectious complications are a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients and are the cause of death in nearly half of them. Bacterial infection is the most frequent infectious complication in lung transplant patients. Among the total of infections, 35%-66% are bacterial and 50%-85% of patients present at least one episode. CMV is the second most frequent cause of infectious complications following lung transplantation. Despite the use of various preventive strategies, the risk of developing CMV disease in lung transplant recipients is over 5% during the first year. This is the only type of solid organ transplant in which the etiology of fungal infection is characteristically Aspergillus spp., in contrast to others in which infection by Candida spp. is most common.

Protection is acquired through the inherent safety of the PPE components, but also their safe and correct use, supported by adequate training and user familiarity. However, the evidence base for HCID PPE ensembles and any associated training is lacking, with subsequent variation between healthcare providers. AIM: To develop an evidence-based assessment and training tool for evaluating PPE ensembles and doffing protocols, in the assessment of patients with suspected HCIDs. METHODS: VIOLET (Visualising Infection with Optimised Light for Education and Training) comprises a healthcare mannequin adapted to deliver simulated bodily fluids containing UV-fluorescent tracers. On demand and remotely operated, the mannequin projectile vomits (blue), coughs (red), has diarrhoea (yellow) and is covered in sweat (orange). Wearing PPE, healthcare staff participate in an HCID risk assessment and examination of the ‘patient’, thereby becoming exposed to these bodily fluids. Contamination of PPE is visualized and body-mapped under UV light before and after removal. Observational findings and participant feedback, around its use as a training exercise, is also recorded. FINDINGS: Significant contamination from different exposure events was seen, enabling evaluation of PPE and doffing procedures used. Observational data and participant feedback demonstrated its strengths and success as a training technique. CONCLUSION: Simulation exercises using VIOLET provide evidence-based assessment of PPE ensembles, and are a valuable resource for training of healthcare staff in wearing and safe doffing of PPE.","Poller, B.; Hall, S.; Bailey, C.; Gregory, S.; Clark, R.; Roberts, P.; Tunbridge, A.; Poran, V.; Crook, B.; Evans, C.",J Hosp Infect,661,1

Since none of the diagnostic criteria are specific to sepsis, it is easy to confound sepsis with noninfectious causes of systemic inflammation, including pancreatitis, cardiac ischemia, bowel perforation, vasculitis, and pulmonary embolism amongst others. Two widely used biomarkers, C-reactive protein and procalcitonin, have proven promising in sepsis diagnosis. Each has found varying success in the clinical context, with some centers relying heavily on these markers and others eschewing their use almost entirely. In this chapter, we present the evidence for their use in the diagnosis of sepsis and management of antibiotic therapy in the intensive care unit context.","Binnie, Alexandra; Lage, Joel; Dos Santos, Claudia C.",Evidence-Based Practice of Critical Care,661,20

Adding to the existing stress surrounding pregnancy and childbirth, the threat of infection and social isolation policies may negatively impact pregnant women and new mothers. Literature on the effect of COVID-19 on fear during pregnancy and childbirth experience is limited. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect the global population, it is important to understand how it has impacted pregnant women and new mothers’ experiences worldwide to inform perinatal care and interventions. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This multicountry study involving China and Canada targets to recruit 1000 pregnant women and new mothers who gave birth since 2020 in each participating country. Participants will be recruited online in the local language through mothers’ groups, antenatal and postnatal clinics and hospital wards. All questionnaires will be completed online. Participants’ level of fear, depression and childbirth experience will be assessed along with other sociodemographic, medical and COVID-related measures. Regression models will be used to compare the outcomes among the participating countries. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been reviewed and approved by the institutional review boards of the participating countries. Findings will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and academic conferences. Results from this study may guide the formulation of future health guidelines and policies in the face of a pandemic.","Lok, Kris Yuet-Wan; Ko, Rachel Wai Tung; Fan, Heidi Sze Lok; Wong, Janet YH; Choi, Edmond PH; Shek, Noel Wan Man; NGAN, Hextan Y S; Tarrant, Marie; Li, Junyan; Huang, Yi-yan; Ouyang, Yan-Qiong; Fong, Daniel Yee Tak",BMJ Open,661,22

Therefore, improving cancer therapeutic strategies using novel alternatives is a top priority on the contemporary scientific agenda. An example of such strategies is immunotherapy, which is based on teaching the immune system to recognize, attack, and kill malignant cancer cells. Several types of immunotherapies are currently used to treat cancer, including adoptive cell therapy (ACT). Chimeric Antigen Receptors therapy (CAR therapy) is a kind of ATC where autologous T cells are genetically engineered to express CARs (CAR-T cells) to specifically kill the tumor cells. CAR-T cell therapy is an opportunity to treat patients that have not responded to other first-line cancer treatments. Nowadays, this type of therapy still has many challenges to overcome to be considered as a first-line clinical treatment. This emerging technology is still classified as an advanced therapy from the pharmaceutical point of view, hence, for it to be applied it must firstly meet certain requirements demanded by the authority. For this reason, the aim of this review is to present a global vision of different immunotherapies and focus on CAR-T cell technology analyzing its elements, its history, and its challenges. Furthermore, analyzing the opportunity areas for CAR-T technology to become an affordable treatment modality taking the basic, clinical, and practical aspects into consideration.","Hernández-López, Alejandrina; Téllez-González, Mario A.; Mondragón-Terán, Paul; Meneses-Acosta, Angélica",Front Pharmacol,661,1

Methods: This was a retrospective cohort of consecutive children admitted to 15 hospitals (13 in Canada and one each in Iran and Costa Rica) up to November 16, 2020. Cases were included if they had SARS-CoV-2 infection or multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) with molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 or positive SARS-CoV-2 serology. Results: Of 211 included cases (Canada N=95; Costa Rica N=84; Iran N=32), 103 (49%) had a presumptive diagnosis of COVID-19 or MIS-C at admission while 108 (51%) were admitted with other diagnoses. Twenty-one (10%) of 211 met criteria for MIS-C. Eighty-seven (41%) had comorbidities. Children admitted in Canada were older than those admitted to non-Canadian sites (median 4.1 versus 2.2 years; p<0.001) and less likely to require mechanical ventilation (3/95 [3%] versus 15/116 [13%]; p<0.05). Requirement for oxygen or ICU occurred in 64 (30%) and death in four, three of whom. had malignancies. Age < 30 days, admission outside of Canada, presence of at least one comorbidity and chest imaging compatible with COVID-19 predicted severe disease. Conclusions: Approximately half of hospitalized children with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or MIS-C were admitted with other suspected diagnoses. Disease was more severe at non-Canadian sites. Neonates, children with comorbidities and those with chest radiographs compatible with COVID-19 were at increased risk for severe disease.","ROBINSON, J.; Barton, M.; Papenburg, J.; Ulloa-Gutierrez, R.; Brenes-Chacon, H.; Yock-Corrales, A.; Ivankovich-Escoto, G.; Soriano-Fallas, A.; Mezerville, M.

Essential workplaces remained open during COVID-19, but few U.S.-based settings detail outcomes. METHODS: Mercury Systems is a U.S.-based manufacturing company that remained open during COVID-19. NPIs – distancing, masking, hand hygiene, ventilation- were successively deployed from March-August 2020. The company expanded sick leave, asked employees to report work outages from illness, and administered employee satisfaction surveys. Three sites in Arizona, southern California and New Hampshire administered testing campaigns via RT-PCR of nasal swabs in late July-early August for all employees at work or at home self-isolating due to symptoms. Descriptive statistics summarized findings. RESULTS: Among 586 employees at three sites, only 1.5% employees developed severe illness over the study duration. Testing campaigns revealed 44 with positive PCR results at a cycle threshold (CT) <37 (likely infectious) and 61 with a CT≥37 (low-level viral load). True positivity rates were consistent with community prevalence at the time: 1.1% in New Hampshire, 6.2% in California, 12.9% in Arizona. Of all employees with positive tests, 99% were asymptomatic. Employee surveys showed high satisfaction. CONCLUSION: In a multi-site U.S. company which instituted NPIs for COVID-19 mitigation, the proportion of asymptomatic COVID-19 infections on surveillance testing was high (99%). Although surges in community transmission were seen in two sites over the study, employee prevalence reflected community prevalence, despite daily workplace presence. This study demonstrates that NPIs likely mitigate severe COVID-19 illness, that PCR tests should incorporate CT values, and that expanded sick leave likely encourages self-isolation, suggesting strategies for work re-openings.","Haigh, Karen Z; Gandhi, Monica",Open Forum Infect Dis,661,21

As COVID-19 mortality occurs mainly in elderly and as Africa has a comparably young population, the death rates should be lower than on other continents. We calculated standardised mortality ratios (SMR) using age-specific case fatality rates for COVID-19 and the age structure of the population of Africa and of other continents. Compared to a European or Northern American population, the standardised mortality ratio was only 0.22 and 0.25, respectively, corresponding to reduction of deaths rates to a quarter. Compared to the Asian and Latin American & Caribbean population, the SMR was 0.43 and 0.44, respectively, corresponding to half the death rate for Africa. It is useful to quantify the isolated effect of the African age-structure on potential COVID-19 mortality for illustrative and communication purposes, keeping in mind the importance of public health measures that have been shown to be effective in reducing cases and deaths. The different aspect of age pyramids of a European and an African population are striking and the potential implications for the pandemic are often discussed but rarely quantified.","Mougeni, F.; Mangaboula, A.; Lell, B.",,661,30

Appropriate respiratory intervention must be provided quickly to lower the chances of death or permanent harm. As a result, respiratory support given in prehospital and interfacility transport can substantially improve health outcomes for these patients, particularly in areas where transportation time to appropriate facilities is lengthy. Existing literature supports the use of non-invasive ventilation (NIV), such as nasal or bilevel continuous positive airway pressure, as a safe form of respiratory support for children under 18 years old in certain transportation settings. This mini review summarizes the literature on pediatric NIV in transport and highlights significant gaps that future researchers should address. In particular, we identify the need to: solidify clinical guidelines for the selection of eligible pediatric patients for transport on NIV; explore the range of factors influencing successful NIV implementation during transportation; and apply appropriate best practices in low and middle income countries.","Ide, Nellie; Allen, Grace; Ashworth, Henry Charles; Dada, Sara",Front Pediatr,661,27

In this study we determine the extent to which the typologies of the SAVA syndemic can be described and utilized for intervention strategies among youth living in the slums of Kampala, Uganda. We analyzed the “Kampala Youth Survey 2014,” a cross-sectional survey conducted in the spring of 2014, consisting of a convenience sample (N = 1134) of urban youth (12–18 years of age). Descriptive statistics were computed for hypothesized risk factors and demographic variables among the 8 typologies of GBV, HIV, and alcohol use. Multinomial logistic regression was conducted to determine statistically significant correlates with each typology. The overall prevalence of GBV was 31.7%, whereas the overall prevalence of alcohol use in the past 12 months was 31.2%. HIV-Positive youth comprised 10.5% of the total sample. Females comprised the majority of the typology with no SAVA components compared to males (55% vs. 45%, respectively), as well as the SAVA syndemic typology (GBV + HIV + ALC +) (58% vs. 42%, respectively). Engaging in commercial sex work (36%), witnessing parental abuse (61%), and depression/suicidality (81%) were all highly prevalent among youth in the SAVA syndemic typology (GBV, HIV, and alcohol use). Sex work and observing parental abuse were associated with the SAVA syndemic typology in the multivariable model. In our study, alcohol rarely coexisted without GBV among the typologies. Therefore, prevention efforts including structural interventions may be particularly warranted in vulnerable populations to address alcohol use, which may directly or indirectly impact GBV and HIV.","Swahn, Monica H.; Culbreth, Rachel; Masyn, Katherine E.; Salazar, Laura F.; Wagman, Jennifer; Kasirye, Rogers",AIDS Behav,661,16

We compared the accuracy of a rapid antigen detection test using exhaled breath condensate by a modified Inflammacheck(®) device with the standard RT-PCR to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: We performed a manufacturer-independent, cross-sectional, diagnostic accuracy study involving two Italian hospitals. Sensitivity, specificity, positive (PLR) and negative likelihood ratio (NLR), positive (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) and diagnostic accuracy with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of Inflammacheck(®) were calculated using the RT-PCR results as the standard. Further RT-PCR tests were conducted on NP specimens from test positive subjects to obtain the Ct (cycle threshold) values as indicative evidence of the viral load. Results: A total of 105 individuals (41 females, 39.0%; 64 males, 61.0%; mean age: 58.4 years) were included in the final analysis, with the RT-PCR being positive in 13 (12.4%) and negative in 92 (87.6%). The agreement between the two methods was 98.1%, with a Cohen’s κ score of 0.91 (95% CI: 0.79–1.00). The overall sensitivity and specificity of the Inflammacheck(®) were 92.3% (95% CI: 64.0%–99.8%) and 98.9% (95% CI: 94.1%–100%), respectively, with a PLR of 84.9 (95% CI: 12.0–600.3) and a NLR of 0.08 (95% CI: 0.01–0.51). Considering a 12.4% disease prevalence in the study cohort, the PPV was 92.3% (95% CI: 62.9%–98.8%) and the NPV was 98.9% (95% CI: 93.3%–99.8%), with an overall accuracy of 98.1% (95% CI: 93.3%–99.8%). The Fagan’s nomogram substantially confirmed the clinical applicability of the test in a realistic scenario with a pre-test probability set at 4%. Ct values obtained for the positive test subjects by means of the RT-PCR were normally distributed between 26 and 38 cycles, corresponding to viral loads from light (38 cycles) to high (26 cycles). The single false negative record had a Ct value of 33, which was close to the mean of the cohort (32.5 cycles). Conclusions: The modified Inflammacheck(®) device may be a rapid, non-demanding and cost-effective method for SARS-CoV-2 detection. This device may be used for routine practice in different healthcare settings (community, hospital, rehabilitation).","Maniscalco, Mauro; Ambrosino, Pasquale; Ciullo, Anna; Fuschillo, Salvatore; Valente, Valerio; Gaudiosi, Carlo; Paris, Debora; Cobuccio, Raffaele; Stefanelli, Francesco; Motta, Andrea",Sensors (Basel),661,1

However, their physiological features may limit their use for obtaining in native form proteins of some specific structural classes, such as for instance polypeptides that undergo extensive post-translational modifications. To some extent, also the production of proteins that depending on disulfide bridges for their stability has been considered difficult in E. coli. Both eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms keep their cytoplasm reduced and, consequently, disulfide bond formation is impaired in this subcellular compartment. Disulfide bridges can stabilize protein structure and are often present in high abundance in secreted proteins. In eukaryotic cells such bonds are formed in the oxidizing environment of endoplasmic reticulum during the export process. Bacteria do not possess a similar specialized subcellular compartment, but they have both export systems and enzymatic activities aimed at the formation and at the quality control of disulfide bonds in the oxidizing periplasm. This article reviews the available strategies for exploiting the physiological mechanisms of bactera to produce properly folded disulfide-bonded proteins.","de Marco, Ario",Microb Cell Fact,661,32

This article proposes a novel multi-level scenario-based predictive analytics framework (MSPAF) to explore the complex relationships between community mental health outcomes and the built environment conditions. The MSPAF combines rigorously validated interpretable machine learning algorithms and scenario-based sensitivity analysis to test various hypotheses on how the built environment impacts community mental health outcomes across the largest metropolitan areas in the US. Among other findings, our results suggest that declining socio-economic conditions of the built environment (e.g., poverty, low income, unemployment, decreased access to public health insurance) are significantly associated with increased reported mental health disorders. Similarly, physical conditions of the built environment (e.g., increased housing vacancies and increased travel costs) are significantly associated with increased reported mental health disorders. However, this positive relationship between the physical conditions of the built environment and mental health outcomes does not hold across all the metropolitan areas, suggesting a mixed effect of the built environment’s physical conditions on community mental health. We conclude by highlighting future opportunities of incorporating other variables and datasets into the MSPAF framework to test additional hypotheses on how the built environment impacts community mental health.","Mukherjee, Sayanti; Frimpong Boamah, Emmanuel; Ganguly, Prasangsha; Botchwey, Nisha",Sci Rep,661,16
