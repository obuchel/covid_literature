18,18,18,Protection of pulmonary epithelial cells from oxidative stress by hMYH adenine glycosylase,12.525232,7.637903,2004-09-27,"BACKGROUND: Oxygen toxicity is a major cause of lung injury. The base excision repair pathway is one of the most important cellular protection mechanisms that responds to oxidative DNA damage. Lesion-specific DNA repair enzymes include hOgg1, hMYH, hNTH and hMTH. METHODS: The above lesion-specific DNA repair enzymes were expressed in human alveolar epithelial cells (A549) using the pSF91.1 retroviral vector. Cells were exposed to a 95% oxygen environment, ionizing radiation (IR), or H(2)O(2). Cell growth analysis was performed under non-toxic conditions. Western blot analysis was performed to verify over-expression and assess endogenous expression under toxic and non-toxic conditions. Statistical analysis was performed using the paired Student's t test with significance being accepted for p < 0.05. RESULTS: Cell killing assays demonstrated cells over-expressing hMYH had improved survival to both increased oxygen and IR. Cell growth analysis of A549 cells under non-toxic conditions revealed cells over-expressing hMYH also grow at a slower rate. Western blot analysis demonstrated over-expression of each individual gene and did not result in altered endogenous expression of the others. However, it was observed that O(2 )toxicity did lead to a reduced endogenous expression of hNTH in A549 cells. CONCLUSION: Increased expression of the DNA glycosylase repair enzyme hMYH in A549 cells exposed to O(2 )and IR leads to improvements in cell survival. DNA repair through the base excision repair pathway may provide an alternative way to offset the damaging effects of O(2 )and its metabolites.","Kremer, Ted M; Rinne, Mikael L; Xu, Yi; Chen, Xian Ming; Kelley, Mark R",Respir Res,18,1
100,100,100,Selective redox regulation of cytokine receptor signaling by extracellular thioredoxin-1,12.789309,7.546424,2007-07-11,"The thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase thioredoxin-1 (Trx1) is known to be secreted by leukocytes and to exhibit cytokine-like properties. Extracellular effects of Trx1 require a functional active site, suggesting a redox-based mechanism of action. However, specific cell surface proteins and pathways coupling extracellular Trx1 redox activity to cellular responses have not been identified so far. Using a mechanism-based kinetic trapping technique to identify disulfide exchange interactions on the intact surface of living lymphocytes, we found that Trx1 catalytically interacts with a single principal target protein. This target protein was identified as the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 8 (TNFRSF8/CD30). We demonstrate that the redox interaction is highly specific for both Trx1 and CD30 and that the redox state of CD30 determines its ability to engage the cognate ligand and transduce signals. Furthermore, we confirm that Trx1 affects CD30-dependent changes in lymphocyte effector function. Thus, we conclude that receptor–ligand signaling interactions can be selectively regulated by an extracellular redox catalyst.","Schwertassek, Ulla; Balmer, Yves; Gutscher, Marcus; Weingarten, Lars; Preuss, Marc; Engelhard, Johanna; Winkler, Monique; Dick, Tobias P",EMBO J,18,1
141,141,141,Autoimmune Cholangitis in the SJL/J Mouse is Antigen Non-specific,12.589364,7.345935,2002-06-11,"Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is an autoimmune disease characterized by intrahepatic bile duct destruction and the production of anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA). The absence of an animal model has been a striking impedance in defining the molecular basis of disease. Previous work has suggested that SJL/J mice immunize with the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC-E2), the major mitochondrial autoantigen of PBC, leads to the development of lymphoid cell infiltration in portal tracts and a model system coined autoimmune cholangitis. We hypothesized that this pathology would be augmented if immunization occurred in the presence of IFN-γ injections. Accordingly, SJL/J mice were immunized with PDC-E2 and, for purpose of control, α-casein. Subgroups of mice were also treated with exogenous IFN-γ. As expected, mice immunized with PDC-E2, with or without IFN-γ, developed high titer AMAs. In contrast, mice immunized with α-casein, develop antinuclear antibodies. More importantly, the livers from mice immunized with PDC-E2 and/or those immunized with α-casein all displayed lymphoid cell infiltration to the portal tracts, irrespective of bile duct size. Indeed, there was no significant difference between the experimental and the control groups by histologic analysis. Thus, autoimmune cholangitis in these mice is antigen non-specific.","Sasaki, Motoko; Allina, Jorge; Odin, Joseph A.; Thung, Swan N.; Coppel, Ross; Nakanuma, Yasuni; Gershwin, M.

152,152,152,Real Time Bayesian Estimation of the Epidemic Potential of Emerging Infectious Diseases,12.652016,7.792872,2008-05-14,"BACKGROUND: Fast changes in human demographics worldwide, coupled with increased mobility, and modified land uses make the threat of emerging infectious diseases increasingly important. Currently there is worldwide alert for H5N1 avian influenza becoming as transmissible in humans as seasonal influenza, and potentially causing a pandemic of unprecedented proportions. Here we show how epidemiological surveillance data for emerging infectious diseases can be interpreted in real time to assess changes in transmissibility with quantified uncertainty, and to perform running time predictions of new cases and guide logistics allocations. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We develop an extension of standard epidemiological models, appropriate for emerging infectious diseases, that describes the probabilistic progression of case numbers due to the concurrent effects of (incipient) human transmission and multiple introductions from a reservoir. The model is cast in terms of surveillance observables and immediately suggests a simple graphical estimation procedure for the effective reproductive number R (mean number of cases generated by an infectious individual) of standard epidemics. For emerging infectious diseases, which typically show large relative case number fluctuations over time, we develop a Bayesian scheme for real time estimation of the probability distribution of the effective reproduction number and show how to use such inferences to formulate significance tests on future epidemiological observations. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Violations of these significance tests define statistical anomalies that may signal changes in the epidemiology of emerging diseases and should trigger further field investigation. We apply the methodology to case data from World Health Organization reports to place bounds on the current transmissibility of H5N1 influenza in humans and establish a statistical basis for monitoring its evolution in real time.","Bettencourt, Luís M.

524,524,524,Assessing the In Vitro Fitness of an Oseltamivir-Resistant Seasonal A/H1N1 Influenza Strain Using a Mathematical Model,12.831038,7.293642,2011-03-24,"In 2007, the A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1) seasonal influenza virus strain acquired the oseltamivir-resistance mutation H275Y in its neuraminidase (NA) gene. Although previous studies had demonstrated that this mutation impaired the replication capacity of the influenza virus in vitro and in vivo, the A/Brisbane/59/2007 H275Y oseltamivir-resistant mutant completely out-competed the wild-type (WT) strain and was, in the 2008–2009 influenza season, the primary A/H1N1 circulating strain. Using a combination of plaque and viral yield assays, and a simple mathematical model, approximate values were extracted for two basic viral kinetics parameters of the in vitro infection. In the ST6GalI-MDCK cell line, the latent infection period (i.e., the time for a newly infected cell to start releasing virions) was found to be 1–3 h for the WT strain and more than 7 h for the H275Y mutant. The infecting time (i.e., the time for a single infectious cell to cause the infection of another one) was between 30 and 80 min for the WT, and less than 5 min for the H275Y mutant. Single-cycle viral yield experiments have provided qualitative confirmation of these findings. These results, though preliminary, suggest that the increased fitness success of the A/Brisbane/59/2007 H275Y mutant may be due to increased infectivity compensating for an impaired or delayed viral release, and are consistent with recent evidence for the mechanistic origins of fitness reduction and recovery in NA expression. The method applied here can reconcile seemingly contradictory results from the plaque and yield assays as two complementary views of replication kinetics, with both required to fully capture a strain's fitness.","Holder, Benjamin P.; Simon, Philippe; Liao, Laura E.; Abed, Yacine; Bouhy, Xavier; Beauchemin, Catherine A.

603,603,603,Immunity Traits in Pigs: Substantial Genetic Variation and Limited Covariation,12.452953,7.324478,2011-07-29,"BACKGROUND: Increasing robustness via improvement of resistance to pathogens is a major selection objective in livestock breeding. As resistance traits are difficult or impossible to measure directly, potential indirect criteria are measures of immune traits (ITs). Our underlying hypothesis is that levels of ITs with no focus on specific pathogens define an individual's immunocompetence and thus predict response to pathogens in general. Since variation in ITs depends on genetic, environmental and probably epigenetic factors, our aim was to estimate the relative importance of genetics. In this report, we present a large genetic survey of innate and adaptive ITs in pig families bred in the same environment. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Fifty four ITs were studied on 443 Large White pigs vaccinated against Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and analyzed by combining a principal component analysis (PCA) and genetic parameter estimation. ITs include specific and non specific antibodies, seric inflammatory proteins, cell subsets by hemogram and flow cytometry, ex vivo production of cytokines (IFNα, TNFα, IL6, IL8, IL12, IFNγ, IL2, IL4, IL10), phagocytosis and lymphocyte proliferation. While six ITs had heritabilities that were weak or not significantly different from zero, 18 and 30 ITs had moderate (0.1<h2≤0.4) or high (h2>0.4) heritability values, respectively. Phenotypic and genetic correlations between ITs were weak except for a few traits that mostly include cell subsets. PCA revealed no cluster of innate or adaptive ITs. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results demonstrate that variation in many innate and adaptive ITs is genetically controlled in swine, as already reported for a smaller number of traits by other laboratories. A limited redundancy of the traits was also observed confirming the high degree of complementarity between innate and adaptive ITs. Our data provide a genetic framework for choosing ITs to be included as selection criteria in multitrait selection programmes that aim to improve both production and health traits.","Flori, Laurence; Gao, Yu; Laloë, Denis; Lemonnier, Gaëtan; Leplat, Jean-Jacques; Teillaud, Angélique; Cossalter, Anne-Marie; Laffitte, Joëlle; Pinton, Philippe; de Vaureix, Christiane; Bouffaud, Marcel; Mercat, Marie-José; Lefèvre, François; Oswald, Isabelle P.; Bidanel, Jean-Pierre; Rogel-Gaillard, Claire",PLoS One,18,1
786,786,786,Protein Reporter Bioassay Systems for the Phenotypic Screening of Candidate Drugs: A Mouse Platform for Anti-Aging Drug Screening,12.540319,7.548535,2012-02-07,"Recent drug discovery efforts have utilized high throughput screening (HTS) of large chemical libraries to identify compounds that modify the activity of discrete molecular targets. The molecular target approach to drug screening is widely used in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, because of the amount of knowledge now available regarding protein structure that has been obtained by computer simulation. The molecular target approach requires that the structure of target molecules, and an understanding of their physiological functions, is known. This approach to drug discovery may, however, limit the identification of novel drugs. As an alternative, the phenotypic- or pathway-screening approach to drug discovery is gaining popularity, particularly in the academic sector. This approach not only provides the opportunity to identify promising drug candidates, but also enables novel information regarding biological pathways to be unveiled. Reporter assays are a powerful tool for the phenotypic screening of compound libraries. Of the various reporter genes that can be used in such assays, those encoding secreted proteins enable the screening of hit molecules in both living cells and animals. Cell- and animal-based screens enable simultaneous evaluation of drug metabolism or toxicity with biological activity. Therefore, drug candidates identified in these screens may have increased biological efficacy and a lower risk of side effects in humans. In this article, we review the reporter bioassay systems available for phenotypic drug discovery.","Chiba, Takuya; Tsuchiya, Tomoshi; Mori, Ryoichi; Shimokawa, Isao",Sensors (Basel),18,1

To investigate this possibility, archival tissues from 213 insectivorous bats (order Chiroptera) were analyzed for hantavirus RNA by RT-PCR. Following numerous failed attempts, hantavirus RNA was detected in ethanol-fixed liver tissue from two banana pipistrelles (Neoromicia nanus), captured near Mouyassué village in Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa, in June 2011. Phylogenetic analysis of partial L-segment sequences using maximum-likelihood and Bayesian methods revealed that the newfound hantavirus, designated Mouyassué virus (MOUV), was highly divergent and basal to all other rodent- and soricomorph-borne hantaviruses, except for Nova virus in the European common mole (Talpa europaea). Full genome sequencing of MOUV and further surveys of other bat species for hantaviruses, now underway, will provide critical insights into the evolution and diversification of hantaviruses.","Sumibcay, Laarni; Kadjo, Blaise; Gu, Se Hun; Kang, Hae Ji; Lim, Burton K; Cook, Joseph A; Song, Jin-Won; Yanagihara, Richard",Virol J,18,1
1008,1008,1008,Application of Molecular Diagnostic Techniques for Viral Testing,12.60673,7.207319,2012-11-30,"Nucleic acid amplification techniques are commonly used currently to diagnose viral diseases and manage patients with this kind of illnesses. These techniques have had a rapid but unconventional route of development during the last 30 years, with the discovery and introduction of several assays in clinical diagnosis. The increase in the number of commercially available methods has facilitated the use of this technology in the majority of laboratories worldwide. This technology has reduced the use of some other techniques such as viral culture based methods and serological assays in the clinical virology laboratory. Moreover, nucleic acid amplification techniques are now the methods of reference and also the most useful assays for the diagnosis in several diseases. The introduction of these techniques and their automation provides new opportunities for the clinical laboratory to affect patient care. The main objectives in performing nucleic acid tests in this field are to provide timely results useful for high-quality patient care at a reasonable cost, because rapid results are associated with improvements in patients care. The use of amplification techniques such as polymerase chain reaction, real-time polymerase chain reaction or nucleic acid sequence-based amplification for virus detection, genotyping and quantification have some advantages like high sensitivity and reproducibility, as well as a broad dynamic range. This review is an up-to-date of the main nucleic acid techniques and their clinical applications, and special challenges and opportunities that these techniques currently provide for the clinical virology laboratory.","Cobo, Fernando",Open Virol J,18,1
1067,1067,1067,Curcumin inhibits HCV replication by induction of heme oxygenase-1 and suppression of AKT,12.538704,7.5541077,2012-08-20,"Although hepatitis C virus (HCV) affects approximately 130–170 million people worldwide, no vaccines are available. HCV is an important cause of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, leading to the need for liver transplantation. In this study, curcumin, a constituent used in traditional Chinese medicine, has been evaluated for its anti-HCV activity and mechanism, using a human hepatoma cell line containing the HCV genotype 1b subgenomic replicon. Below the concentration of 20% cytotoxicity, curcumin dose-dependently inhibited HCV replication by luciferase reporter gene assay, HCV RNA detection and HCV protein analysis. Under the same conditions, curcumin also dose-dependently induced heme oxygenase-1 with the highest induction at 24 h. Hemin, a heme oxygenase-1 inducer, also inhibited HCV protein expression in a dose-dependent manner. The knockdown of heme oxygenase-1 partially reversed the curcumin-inhibited HCV protein expression. In addition to the heme oxygenase-1 induction, signaling molecule activities of AKT, extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) were inhibited by curcumin. Using specific inhibitors of PI3K-AKT, MEK-ERK and NF-κB, the results suggested that only PI3K-AKT inhibition is positively involved in curcumin-inhibited HCV replication. Inhibition of ERK and NF-κB was likely to promote HCV protein expression. In summary, curcumin inhibited HCV replication by heme oxygenase-1 induction and AKT pathway inhibition. Although curcumin also inhibits ERK and NF-κB activities, it slightly increased the HCV protein expression. This result may provide information when curcumin is used as an adjuvant in anti-HCV therapy.","CHEN, MING-HO; LEE, MING-YANG; CHUANG, JING-JING; LI, YI-ZHEN; NING, SIN-TZU; CHEN, JUNG-CHOU; LIU, YI-WEN",Int J Mol Med,18,22
1283,1283,1283,Eukaryotic Initiation Factor 2α - a Downstream Effector of Mammalian Target of Rapamycin - Modulates DNA Repair and Cancer Response to Treatment,12.582381,7.272824,2013-10-25,"In an effort to circumvent resistance to rapamycin – an mTOR inhibitor - we searched for novel rapamycin-downstream-targets that may be key players in the response of cancer cells to therapy. We found that rapamycin, at nM concentrations, increased phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2α in rapamycin-sensitive and estrogen-dependent MCF-7 cells, but had only a minimal effect on eIF2α phosphorylation in the rapamycin-insensitive triple-negative MDA-MB-231 cells. Addition of salubrinal – an inhibitor of eIF2α dephosphorylation – decreased expression of a surface marker associated with capacity for self renewal, increased senescence and induced clonogenic cell death, suggesting that excessive phosphorylation of eIF2α is detrimental to the cells' survival. Treating cells with salubrinal enhanced radiation-induced increase in eIF2α phosphorylation and clonogenic death and showed that irradiated cells are more sensitive to increased eIF2α phosphorylation than non-irradiated ones. Similar to salubrinal - the phosphomimetic eIF2α variant - S51D - increased sensitivity to radiation, and both abrogated radiation-induced increase in breast cancer type 1 susceptibility gene, thus implicating enhanced phosphorylation of eIF2α in modulation of DNA repair. Indeed, salubrinal inhibited non-homologous end joining as well as homologous recombination repair of double strand breaks that were induced by I-SceI in green fluorescent protein reporter plasmids. In addition to its effect on radiation, salubrinal enhanced eIF2α phosphorylation and clonogenic death in response to the histone deacetylase inhibitor – vorinostat. Finally, the catalytic competitive inhibitor of mTOR - Ku-0063794 - increased phosphorylation of eIF2α demonstrating further the involvement of mTOR activity in modulating eIF2α phosphorylation. These experiments suggest that excessive phosphorylation of eIF2α decreases survival of cancer cells; making eIF2α a worthy target for drug development, with the potential to enhance the cytotoxic effects of established anti-neoplastic therapies and circumvent resistance to rapalogues and possibly to other drugs that inhibit upstream components of the mTOR pathway.","Tuval-Kochen, Liron; Paglin, Shoshana; Keshet, Gilmor; Lerenthal, Yaniv; Nakar, Charles; Golani, Tamar; Toren, Amos; Yahalom, Joachim; Pfeffer, Raphael; Lawrence, Yaacov",PLoS One,18,1

Upper respiratory infection (URI), largely due to adenovirus, is an endemic cause of morbidity in military training. Whether clinical presentations differ or excess morbidity results from coinfection is unclear. METHODS: The Center for Advanced Molecular Detection evaluates epidemiology and rapid diagnostics of respiratory pathogens in trainees with URI. From May 1, 2009, to November 30, 2009, demographic, clinical, and PCR data from throat and nasal specimens for adenovirus and 2009 H1N1 were prospectively collected. RESULTS: 375 trainees with URI enrolled and were tested for both adenovirus and 2009 H1N1 by PCR (median age 20; 89% male). Adenovirus PCR was positive in 72% (96% serotype E-4) and 2009 H1N1 in 20%. Males were more likely to have adenovirus and females more likely to have 2009 H1N1 (p = 0.047). Subjects with 2009 H1N1 presented an average of 1 week earlier in training, had shorter illness duration before enrollment, less sore throat, diarrhea, and fewer abnormal findings on throat exam. Coryza and cough were more common with 2009 H1N1 compared to adenovirus. Subjects with 2009 H1N1 were less likely to have adenovirus than those without, despite persistently high frequencies of adenovirus detections during peak 2009 H1N1 weeks (15% vs. 83%, p < 0.01). Coinfection with adenovirus and 2009 H1N1 was rare (4%). Rates of hospitalization and pneumonia did not differ between the adenovirus, 2009 H1N1, or coinfected groups. CONCLUSION: Military trainees with 2009 H1N1 vs. adenovirus have differing clinical presentations, and males are more likely to have adenovirus. Despite high frequencies of adenovirus infection, coinfection with adenovirus and 2009 H1N1 is rare and apparently does not result in increased morbidity.","Yun, Heather C.; Fugate, William H.; Murray, Clinton K.; Cropper, Thomas L.; Lott, Lisa; McDonald, J.

It is becoming increasingly evident that a therapeutic application, to be effective, needs to target not only mature myofibers, but also muscle progenitors cells or muscle stem cells able to form new muscle tissue and to restore myofibers lost as the result of the diseases or during normal homeostasis so as to guarantee effective and lost lasting effects. Correction of the genetic defect using oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) or engineered nucleases holds great potential for the treatment of many of the musculoskeletal disorders. The encouraging results obtained by studying in vitro systems and model organisms have set the groundwork for what is likely to become an emerging field in the area of molecular and regenerative medicine. Furthermore, the ability to isolate and expand from patients various types of muscle progenitor cells capable of committing to the myogenic lineage provides the opportunity to establish cell lines that can be used for transplantation following ex vivo manipulation and expansion. The purpose of this article is to provide a perspective on approaches aimed at correcting the genetic defect using gene editing strategies and currently under development for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the most sever of the neuromuscular disorders. Emphasis will be placed on describing the potential of using the patient own stem cell as source of transplantation and the challenges that gene editing technologies face in the field of regenerative biology.","Bertoni, Carmen",Front Physiol,18,1

Epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate 8 (EPS8), whose function is pivotal for tumor proliferation, progression and metastasis, has been found to be overexpressed in most human tumor types, while its expression in normal tissue is low. The aim of the present study was to identify human leukemia antigen (HLA)-A*0201-restricted epitopes of EPS8 by using a reverse immunology approach. To achieve this, computer algorithms were used to predict HLA-A*0201 molecular binding, proteasome cleavage patterns as well as translocation of transporters associated with antigen processing. Candidate peptides were experimentally validated by T2 binding affinity assay and brefeldin-A decay assay. The functional avidity of peptide-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) induced from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy volunteers were evaluated by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay and a cytotoxicity assay. Four peptides, designated as P455, P92, P276 and P360, had high affinity and stability of binding towards the HLA-A*0201 molecule, and specific CTLs induced by them significantly responded to the corresponding peptides and secreted IFN-γ. At the same time, the CTLs were able to specifically lyse EPS8-expressing cell lines in an HLA-A*0201-restricted manner.

Since their discovery in 1999, over 120 proteins have been described to be localized to these structures (in 154 publications).

SGs have been linked to several pathologies including inflammatory diseases, cancer, viral infection, and neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). In ALS and FTD, the majority of cases have no known etiology and exposure to external stress is frequently proposed as a contributor to either disease initiation or the rate of disease progression. Of note, both ALS and FTD are characterized by pathological inclusions, where some well-known SG markers localize with the ALS related proteins TDP-43 and FUS. We propose that TDP-43 and FUS serve as an interface between genetic susceptibility and environmental stress exposure in disease pathogenesis.

However, extracellular HMGB1 exerts actions, which are distinctly different compared with these intracellular functions. HMGB1, when released extracellularly, is a potent innate signal, which initiates host defense mechanisms or tissue regeneration. HMGB1 has two DNA-binding domains: HMG A box and B box. The HMGB1 A box exhibits an antagonistic, anti-inflammatory effect, and is a potential therapeutic target, however, the large-scale expression and purification of the HMGB1 A box with high efficiency remains to be reported. In the present study, a SUMO-fusion expression system was used to express and purify high levels of functional HMGB1 A box to meet the requirements of therapeutic protein production.","GE, WEN-SONG; FAN, JIAN-GAO; CHEN, YING-WEI; XU, LEI-MING",Mol Med Rep,18,22
2022,2022,2022,Viral Interference and Persistence in Mosquito-Borne Flaviviruses,12.405103,7.4197087,2015-10-25,"Mosquito-borne flaviviruses are important pathogens for humans, and the detection of two or more flaviviruses cocirculating in the same geographic area has often been reported. However, the epidemiological impact remains to be determined. Mosquito-borne flaviviruses are primarily transmitted through Aedes and Culex mosquitoes; these viruses establish a life-long or persistent infection without apparent pathological effects. This establishment requires a balance between virus replication and the antiviral host response. Viral interference is a phenomenon whereby one virus inhibits the replication of other viruses, and this condition is frequently associated with persistent infections. Viral interference and persistent infection are determined by several factors, such as defective interfering particles, competition for cellular factors required for translation/replication, and the host antiviral response. The interaction between two flaviviruses typically results in viral interference, indicating that these viruses share common features during the replicative cycle in the vector. The potential mechanisms involved in these processes are reviewed here.","Salas-Benito, Juan Santiago; De Nova-Ocampo, Mónica",J Immunol Res,18,1

Notably, DC roles in regulating innate CD11b(+)Ly-6C(hi) monocyte functions during neuroinflammation have not yet been addressed. Using selective ablation of CD11c(hi)PDCA-1(int/lo) DCs without alteration in CD11c(int)PDCA-1(hi) plasmacytoid DC number, we found that CD11c(hi) DCs are essential to control neuroinflammation caused by infection with neurotropic Japanese encephalitis virus, through early and increased infiltration of CD11b(+)Ly-6C(hi) monocytes and higher expression of CC chemokines. More interestingly, selective CD11c(hi) DC ablation provided altered differentiation and function of infiltrated CD11b(+)Ly-6C(hi) monocytes in the CNS through Flt3-L and GM-CSF, which was closely associated with severely enhanced neuroinflammation. Furthermore, CD11b(+)Ly-6C(hi) monocytes generated in CD11c(hi) DC-ablated environment had a deleterious rather than protective role during neuroinflammation, and were more quickly recruited into inflamed CNS, depending on CCR2, thereby exacerbating neuroinflammation via enhanced supply of virus from the periphery. Therefore, our data demonstrate that CD11c(hi) DCs provide a critical and unexpected role to preserve the immune-privileged CNS in lethal neuroinflammation via regulating the differentiation, function, and trafficking of CD11b(+)Ly-6C(hi) monocytes.","Kim, Jin Hyoung; Choi, Jin Young; Kim, Seong Bum; Uyangaa, Erdenebelig; Patil, Ajit Mahadev; Han, Young Woo; Park, Sang-Youel; Lee, John Hwa; Kim, Koanhoi; Eo, Seong Kug",Sci Rep,18,1

Methods: In this study, we investigated whether C-class CpG ODN (CpG ODN-685) could facilitate tumor cell lysate to induce vigorous anti-tumor activity against tumors in mice both prophylactically and therapeutically. Results: It was found that the combination of tumor cell lysate and CpG ODN-685 could inhibit the growth of B16 melanoma and prolong the survival of tumor-bearing mice. Moreover CpG ODN-685 with the addition of tumor cell lysate can also cause the generation of tumor specific immune memory by inducing specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes and helper T lymphocytes in mice.

RL significantly increased food intake and weight gain of CIA rats without any observable adverse effect; ameliorated joint erythema and swelling; inhibited immune cell infiltration, bone erosion and osteophyte formation in joints; reduced joint protein expression levels of TLR4, phospho-TAK1, phospho-NF-κB p65, phospho-c-Jun and phospho-IRF3; lowered levels of inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-17A and MCP-1 in sera and TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β and IL-17A in joints); elevated serum IL-10 level; reinvigorated activities of antioxidant SOD, CAT and GSH-Px in the liver and serum; reduced Th17 cell proportions in splenocytes; inhibited splenocyte proliferation and activation; and lowered serum IgG level. In conclusion, RL at nontoxic doses inhibited TLR4 signaling and potently improved clinical conditions of CIA rats.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the regulation of vascular function and assess the vascular redox balance in ACE2-deficient (ACE2(-/y)) animals. Experiments were performed in 20–22 week-old C57BL/6 and ACE2(-/y) male mice. Evaluation of endothelium-dependent and -independent relaxation revealed an impairment of in vitro and in vivo vascular function in ACE2(-/y) mice. Drastic reduction in eNOS expression at both protein and mRNA levels, and a decrease in (•)NO concentrations were observed in aortas of ACE2(-/y) mice in comparison to controls. Consistently, these mice presented a lower plasma and urine nitrite concentration, confirming reduced (•)NO availability in ACE2-deficient animals. Lipid peroxidation was significantly increased and superoxide dismutase activity was decreased in aorta homogenates of ACE2(-/y) mice, indicating impaired antioxidant capacity. Taken together, our data indicate, that ACE2 regulates vascular function by modulating nitric oxide release and oxidative stress. In conclusion, we elucidate mechanisms by which ACE2 is involved in the maintenance of vascular homeostasis.

METHODS: We evaluate the influence of the antitumoral fraction of the E. tirucalli latex in the larynx squamous cell carcinoma (Hep-2), on the morphology, cell proliferation and gene expression. The Hep-2 cells were cultivated in complete medium (MEM 10 %) and treated with E. tirucalli latex for 1, 3, 5 and 7 days. After statistically analyzing the proliferation of the tested cells, the cells were cultivated again for RNA extraction and the Rapid Subtractive Hybridization (RaSH) technique was used to identify genes with altered expression. The genes found using the RaSH technique were analyzed by Gene Ontology (GO) using Ingenuity Systems. RESULTS: The five genes found to have differential expression were validated by real-time quantitative PCR. Though treatment with E. tirucalli latex did not change the cell morphology in comparison to control samples, but the cell growth was significantly decreased. The RaSH showed change in the expression of some genes, including ANXA1, TCEA1, NGFRAP1, ITPR1 and CD55, which are associated with inflammatory response, transcriptional regulation, apoptosis, calcium ion transport regulation and complement system, respectively. The E. tirucalli latex treatment down-regulated ITPR1 and up-regulated ANXA1 and CD55 genes, and was validated by real-time quantitative PCR. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate the involvement of E. tirucalli latex in the altered expression of genes involved in tumorigenic processes, which could potentially be applied as a therapeutic indicator of larynx cancer.

Next generation sequencing (NGS) is a powerful technology to define genomic sequences of the viruses. Of particular interest is the use of whole genome sequencing (WGS) to perform phylogeographic analysis, that allows the detection and tracking of the emergence of viral infections. Hantaviruses, Bunyaviridae, cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in humans. We propose to use WGS for the phylogeographic analysis of human hantavirus infections. A novel multiplex PCR-based NGS was developed to gather whole genome sequences of Hantaan virus (HTNV) from HFRS patients and rodent hosts in endemic areas. The obtained genomes were described for the spatial and temporal links between cases and their sources. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated geographic clustering of HTNV strains from clinical specimens with the HTNV strains circulating in rodents, suggesting the most likely site and time of infection. Recombination analysis demonstrated a genome organization compatible with recombination of the HTNV S segment. The multiplex PCR-based NGS is useful and robust to acquire viral genomic sequences and may provide important ways to define the phylogeographical association and molecular evolution of hantaviruses.","Kim, Won-Keun; Kim, Jeong-Ah; Song, Dong Hyun; Lee, Daesang; Kim, Yong Chul; Lee, Sook-Young; Lee, Seung-Ho; No, Jin Sun; Kim, Ji Hye; Kho, Jeong Hoon; Gu, Se Hun; Jeong, Seong Tae; Wiley, Michael; Kim, Heung-Chul; Klein, Terry A.; Palacios, Gustavo; Song, Jin-Won",Sci Rep,18,1

In this study we determined that two inbred lines of chicken differing in their genetic background , Lines 0 and C-B12, were respectively relatively resistant and susceptible to infection with the low pathogenicity influenza virus A/Turkey/England/647/77 as defined by substantial differences in viral shedding trajectories. Resistant birds, although infected, were unable to transmit virus to contact birds, as ultimately only the presence of a sustained cloacal shedding (and not oropharyngeal shedding) was critical for transmission. Restriction of within-bird transmission of virus occurred in the resistant line, with intra-nares or cloacal infection resulting in only local shedding and failing to transmit fully through the gastro-intestinal-pulmonary tract. Resistance to infection was independent of adaptive immune responses, including the expansion of specific IFNγ secreting cells or production of influenza-specific antibody. Genetic resistance to a novel H9N2 virus was less robust, though significant differences between host genotypes were still clearly evident. The existence of host-genetic determination of the outcome of influenza infection offers tools for the further dissection of this regulation and also for understanding the mechanisms of influenza transmission within and between birds.","Ruiz-Hernandez, Raul; Mwangi, William; Peroval, Marylene; Sadeyen, Jean-Remy; Ascough, Stephanie; Balkissoon, Devanand; Staines, Karen; Boyd, Amy; McCauley, John; Smith, Adrian; Butter, Colin",Sci Rep,18,1

CMV reactivates in approximately one-third of latently infected non-immune-suppressed hosts during critical illness; however, its role as a pathogen in these patients remains unclear. CMV reactivation has been linked to bacterial sepsis and likely results from inflammation, transient immune compromise, and viral epigenetic changes. While CMV may improve immune response to some bacterial infections, other data suggest that CMV induces exaggerated responses to severe infections that may be harmful to latently infected hosts. These results also suggest that previous infection history may explain significant differences seen between human septic responses and murine models of sepsis. While critically ill human hosts clearly have worse outcomes associated with CMV reactivation, determining causality remains an area of investigation, with randomized control trials currently being performed.

Our recent studies have found that one subset of hematopoietic cells can be induced to dedifferentiate into multipotent stem cells by means of a proliferating fibroblast releasable factor, M-CSF. Understanding the importance of stem cells on skin wound healing, here we evaluate the biological significance of M-CSF on skin wound healing. In an in vivo mouse skin excisional wound model, we found that SSEA-positive stem cells were present in wounded but not normal skin. After isolating skin cells from either normal or wounded skin by collagenase digestion, and analyzing the SSEA-1 positive cells by flow cytometry, we found a significant increase in the number of SSEA-1 positive cells in wounded skin. Topical application of M-CSF in skin wounds accelerated healing remarkably, while application of M-CSF-neutralizing antibody slowed wound healing. Furthermore, injection of EGFP-labeled hematopoietic cell-derived stem cells generated from M-CSF treated splenocytes resulted in EGFP-labeled cells being enriched in the skin wound site and further differentiated into functional organ-specific cells. Together, these data demonstrated that M-CSF makes a significant contribution to the healing process by inducing hematopoietic cell dedifferentiation into stem cells.","Li, Yunyuan; Jalili, Reza Baradar; Ghahary, Aziz",Sci Rep,18,1

Unlike schools in the US, human contacts within Chinese colleges are extremely clustered, partly due to the highly organized lifestyle of Chinese college students. Simulations of influenza spreading across real contact networks are in good accordance with real influenza records; however, epidemic simulations across idealized scale-free or small-world networks show considerable overestimation of disease prevalence, thus challenging the widely-applied idealized human contact models in epidemiology. Furthermore, the special contact pattern within Chinese colleges results in disease spreading patterns distinct from those of the US schools. Remarkably, class cancelation, though simple, shows a mitigating power equal to quarantine/vaccination applied on ~25% of college students, which quantitatively explains its success in Chinese colleges during the SARS period.

In this commentary, a set of seven specific and concrete actions are proposed to directly address these issues and to accelerate P. falciparum elimination within the Greater Mekong Subregion to avert a wider public health crisis. These actions are specifically needed to elevate the situation and response mechanisms to those of a true emergency; to address systems-level challenges with personnel limitations and stock-outs of key commodities; and to restructure the response mechanisms to be well-aligned with the required outcomes.

The P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) has emerged as a potential site in the regulation of inflammation in RA but little is known of its functional role on the differentiation of Th17 cells. This study investigates the in vitro and in vivo effects of P2X7R on Th17 cell differentiation during type II collagen (CII) induced experimental arthritis model. In CII-treated dendritic cells (DCs) and DC/CD4(+) T coculture system, pretreatment with pharmacological antagonists of P2X7R (Suramin and A-438079) caused strong inhibition of production of Th17-promoting cytokines (IL-1β, TGF-β1, IL-23p19 and IL-6). Exposure to CII induced the elevation of mRNAs encoding retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor α and γt, which were abolished by pretreatment with P2X7R antagonists. Furthermore, blocking P2X7R signaling abolished the CII-mediated increase in IL-17A. Blockade of P2X7R remarkably inhibited hind paw swelling and ameliorated pathological changes in ankle joint of the collagen-induced arthritis mice. Thus, we demonstrated a novel function for P2X7R signaling in regulating CII-induced differentiation of Th17 cells. P2X7R signaling facilitates the development of the sophisticated network of DC-derived cytokines that favors a Th17 phenotype.","Fan, Zhi-Dan; Zhang, Ya-Yuan; Guo, Yi-Hong; Huang, Na; Ma, Hui-Hui; Huang, Hui; Yu, Hai-Guo",Sci Rep,18,1

The present study explored the role of IGF-1R in the development and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the possibility of IGF-1R silencing by lentivirus-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) as a therapeutic target for HCC. We showed that IGF-1R mRNA was up-regulated in Huh7 and Hep3B cells and human HCC tissues, and that IGF-1R knockdown by RNAi led to decreased proliferation, apoptosis induction, and decreased migration and invasion of Huh7 and Hep3B cells. Further, the in vivo study indicated that IGF-1R knockdown markedly diminished the tumorigenesis and metastasis of Huh7 xenograft. Moreover, the intratumoral administration of lentivirus-IGF-1R siRNA led to significant tumor growth inhibition in an established Huh7 xenograft model. Mechanistic investigations showed that midkine was found to be the most significantly down-regulated protein in Huh7 cells with IGF-1R knockdown, and ectopic overexpression of midkine significantly rescued inhibition of Huh7 cell proliferation, migration, and invasion caused by IGF-1R suppression. Collectively, these data suggest that IGF-1R inhibition by RNAi can significantly suppress HCC growth and invasion at least partially through down-regulating midkine expression, and IGF-1R is a potential target for HCC gene therapy.","Bie, Cai Qun; Liu, Xu You; Cao, Ming Rong; Huang, Qiu Yan; Tang, Hui Jun; Wang, Min; Cao, Guo Li; Yi, Ting Zhuang; Wu, Sheng Lan; Xu, Wei Jie; Tang, Shao Hui",Oncotarget,18,1

The lay press, as well as government and non-government agencies, play a complementary role of extracting findings of high interest or importance and translating them for general viewing. The need for accurate reporting and public advising is paramount when attempting to tackle epidemic outbreaks through behavior change. Yet, public trust in media outlets is at a historic low. The Crisis and Emergency Risk Communication (CERC) model for media reporting on public health emergencies was established in 2005 and has subsequently been used to analyze media reporting on outbreaks of influenza and measles as well as smoking habits and medication compliance. However, no media analysis had yet been performed on the 2013–2016 Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak. This study compared the EVD information relayed by lay press sources with general review articles in the academic literature through a mixed-methods analysis. These findings suggest that comprehensive review articles could not serve as a source to clarify and contextualize the uncertainties around the EVD outbreak, perhaps due to adherence to technical accuracy at the expense of clarity within the context of outbreak conditions. This finding does not imply inferiority of the academic literature, nor does it draw direct causation between confusion in review articles and public misunderstanding. Given the erosion of the barriers siloing academia, combined with the demands of today’s fast-paced media environment, contemporary researchers should realize that no study is outside the public forum and to therefore consider shifting the paradigm to take personal responsibility in the process of accurately translating their scientific words into public policy actions to best serve as a source of clarity.","Kieh, Mark D.; Cho, Elim M.; Myles, Ian A.",PLoS One,18,28

Participants reported 13 person-hours of contact and 8 contacts per day on average, which decreased over age but increased with household size, years of education and income level. Prolonged and frequent contacts, and contacts at home, school and work were more likely to involve physical contacts. Strong age-assortativity was observed in all age groups. We evaluated the characteristics of social contact patterns relevant to the spread of respiratory infectious diseases in Hong Kong.

Currently, the recommended treatment for patients with high-risk MDS is the methylation agent decitabine (DAC), a drug that can induce the reexpression of silenced tumor suppressor genes. We investigated the effects of DAC treatment on the myeloid MDS cell line SKM-1 and investigated the role of FOXO3A, a potentially tumor-suppressive transcription factor, by silencing its expression prior to DAC treatment. We found that FOXO3A exists in an inactive, hyperphosphorylated form in SKM-1 cells, but that DAC both induces FOXO3A expression and reactivates the protein by reducing its phosphorylation level. Furthermore, we show that this FOXO3A activation is responsible for the DAC-induced differentiation of SKM-1 cells into monocytes, as well as for SKM-1 cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and autophagy. Collectively, these results suggest that FOXO3A reactivation may contribute to the therapeutic effects of DAC in MDS.","Zeng, Wen; Dai, Hanjun; Yan, Ming; Cai, Xiaojun; Luo, Hong; Ke, Min; Liu, Zeming",J Immunol Res,18,8

Patients’ samples were screened by real-time RT-PCR and influenza viruses isolated were characterized antigenically by haemagglutination inhibition assay and genetically by sequencing of HA and NA genes. RESULTS: 32% (397/1248) of ILI and 29% (581/1997) of SARI patients tested were positive for influenza viruses. In 2014–2015 the median week of influenza detection was week 7/2015 with B/Yamagata lineage viruses dominating (79%); in 2015–2016—week 5/2016 was the median with A/H1N1pdm09 viruses prevailing (83%); and in 2016–2017 a bimodal distribution of influenza activity was observed—the first wave was caused by A/H3N2 (55%) with median week 51/2016 and the second by B/Victoria lineage viruses (45%) with median week 9/2017. For ILI, influenza virus detection was highest in children aged 5–14 years while for SARI patients most were aged >15 years and 27 (4.6%) of 581 SARI cases died during the three seasons. Persons aged 30–64 years had the highest risk of fatal outcome, notably those infected with A/H1N1pdm09 (OR 11.41, CI 3.94–33.04, p<0.001). A/H1N1pdm09 viruses analyzed by gene sequencing fell into genetic groups 6B and 6B.1; A/H3N2 viruses belonged to genetic subclades 3C.3b, 3C.3a, 3C.2a and 3C.2a1; B/Yamagata lineage viruses were of clade 3 and B/Victoria lineage viruses fell in clade1A. CONCLUSION: In Georgia influenza virus activity occurred mainly from December through March in all seasons, with varying peak weeks and predominating viruses. Around one third of ILI/ SARI cases were associated with influenza caused by antigenically and genetically distinct influenza viruses over the course of the three seasons.","Machablishvili, Ann; Chakhunashvili, Giorgi; Zakhashvili, Khatuna; Karseladze, Irakli; Tarkhan-Mouravi, Olgha; Gavashelidze, Mari; Jashiashvili, Tamar; Sabadze, Lela; Imnadze, Paata; Daniels, Rodney S.; Ermetal, Burcu; McCauley, John W.",PLoS One,18,1

Among T lymphocytes, functions of memory cells are provided by their subsets: central memory, effector memory, tissue-resident memory, regulatory memory and stem memory T cells. Memory T and B lymphocytes have an essential role in the immunity against microbial pathogens but are also involved in autoimmunity and maternal-fetal tolerance. Furthermore, the evidence of immunological memory has been established for NK cells. NK cells can respond to haptens or viruses, which results in generation of antigen-specific memory cells. T, B and NK cells, which have a role in immunological memory, have been characterized phenotypically and functionally. During the secondary immune response, these cells are involved in the reaction against foreign antigens, including pathogens, and take part in autoimmune diseases, but also are crucial to immunological tolerance and vaccine therapy.","Ratajczak, Weronika; Niedźwiedzka-Rystwej, Paulina; Tokarz-Deptuła, Beata; Deptuła, Wiesław",Cent Eur J Immunol,18,1

NAFLD is generally exhibited by non-progressive simple steatosis. However, a significant subset of patient’s progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) that is defined by the presence of steatosis, inflammation and hepatocyte injury with fibrosis. Unfortunately, there are no approved therapies for NAFLD or NASH and therefore therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. Niclosamide is an U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved anthelmintic drug that mediates its effect by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation. Niclosamide and its salt forms, Niclosamide Ethanolamine (NEN), and Niclosamide Piperazine (NPP) have shown efficacy in murine models of diet induced obesity characterized by attenuation of the prominent fatty liver disease phenotype and improved glucose metabolism. While the exact mechanism(s) underlying these changes remains unclear, the ability to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation leading to increased energy expenditure and lipid metabolism or attenuation of PKA mediated glucagon signaling in the liver have been proposed. Unfortunately, niclosamide has very poor water solubility, leading to low oral bioavailability. This, in addition to mitochondrial uncoupling activity and potential genotoxicity have reduced enthusiasm for its clinical use. More recently, salt forms of niclosamide, NEN and NPP, have demonstrated improved oral bioavailability while retaining activity. This suggests that development of safer more effective niclosamide derivatives for the treatment of NAFLD and Type 2 Diabetes may be possible. Herein we explored the ability of a series of N-substituted phenylbenzamide derivatives of the niclosamide salicylanilide chemotype to attenuate hepatic steatosis using a novel phenotypic in vitro model of fatty liver and the high fat diet-fed mouse model of diet induced obesity. These studies identified novel compounds with improved pre-clinical properties that attenuate hepatic steatosis in vitro and in vivo. These compounds with improved drug properties may be useful in alleviating symptoms and protection against disease progression in patients with metabolic syndrome and NAFLD.","Bhagat, Hiral A.; Compton, Sarah A.; Musso, David L.; Laudeman, Christopher P.; Jackson, Kimberly M.

We applied metagenomic technology to avian virus surveillance to study the main viruses infecting six poultry farms in two provinces in eastern China. Cloacal/throat double swabs were collected from 60 birds at each farm according to a random sampling method. The results showed that the method could simultaneously detect major viruses infecting farms, including avian influenza virus, infectious bronchitis virus, Newcastle disease virus, rotavirus G, duck hepatitis B virus, and avian leukemia virus subgroup J in several farms. The test results were consistent with the results from traditional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or reverse transcription-PCR analyses. Five H9N2 and one H3N8 avian influenza viruses were detected at the farms and were identified as low pathogenic avian influenza viruses according to HA cleavage sites analysis. One detected Newcastle disease virus was classified as Class II genotype I and avirulent type according to F0 cleavage sites analysis. Three avian infectious bronchitis viruses were identified as 4/91, CK/CH/LSC/99I and TC07-2 genotypes by phylogenetic analysis of S1 genes. The viral infection surveillance method using metagenomics technology enables the monitoring of multiple viral infections, which allows the detection of main infectious viruses.","Qiu, Yuan; Wang, Suchun; Huang, Baoxu; Zhong, Huanxiang; Pan, Zihao; Zhuang, Qingye; Peng, Cheng; Hou, Guangyu; Wang, Kaicheng",PLoS One,18,1
3659,3659,3659,Mapping novel genetic loci associated with female liver weight variations using Collaborative Cross mice,12.476628,7.372048,2018-10-24,"BACKGROUND: Liver weight is a complex trait, controlled by polygenic factors and differs within populations. Dissecting the genetic architecture underlying these variations will facilitate the search for key role candidate genes involved directly in the hepatomegaly process and indirectly involved in related diseases etiology. METHODS: Liver weight of 506 mice generated from 39 different Collaborative Cross (CC) lines with both sexes at age 20 weeks old was determined using an electronic balance. Genomic DNA of the CC lines was genotyped with high‐density single nucleotide polymorphic markers. RESULTS: Statistical analysis revealed a significant (P < 0.05) variation of liver weight between the CC lines, with broad sense heritability (H (2)) of 0.32 and genetic coefficient of variation (CV(G)) of 0.28. Subsequently, quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping was performed, and results showed a significant QTL only for females on chromosome 8 at genomic interval 88.61‐93.38 Mb (4.77 Mb). Three suggestive QTL were mapped at chromosomes 4, 12 and 13. The four QTL were designated as LWL1‐LWL4 referring to liver weight loci 1‐4 on chromosomes 8, 4, 12 and 13, respectively. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this report presents, for the first time, the utilization of the CC for mapping QTL associated with baseline liver weight in mice. Our findings demonstrate that liver weight is a complex trait controlled by multiple genetic factors that differ significantly between sexes.","Abu‐Toamih Atamni, Hanifa J.; Botzman, Maya; Mott, Richard; Gat‐Viks, Irit; Iraqi, Fuad A.",Animal Model Exp Med,18,22

Several types of IFN have been identified; however, limited information is available in poultry, especially using live animal experimental models. IFN-lambda (IFN-λ) has recently been shown to exert a significant antiviral impact against viral pathogens in mammals. In order to investigate the in vivo potential of chicken IFN-λ (chIFN-λ) as a regulator of innate immunity, and potential antiviral therapeutics, we profiled the transcriptome of chIFN-λ-stimulated chicken immune organs (in vivo) and compared it with primary chicken embryo fibroblasts (in vitro). Employing the baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS), recombinant chIFN-λ3 (rchIFN-λ3) was produced and its biological activities were demonstrated. The rchIFNλ3 induced a great array of IFN-regulated genes in primary chicken fibroblast cells. The transcriptional profiling using RNA-seq and subsequent bioinformatics analysis (gene ontology, differential expressed genes, and KEGGs analysis) of the bursa of Fabricious and the thymus demonstrated an upregulation of crucial immune genes (viperin, IKKB, CCL5, IL1β, and AP1) as well as the antiviral signaling pathways. Interestingly, this experimental approach revealed contrasting evidence of the antiviral potential of chIFN-λ in both in vivo and in vitro models. Taken together, our data signifies the potential of chIFN-λ as a potent antiviral cytokine and highlights its future possible use as an antiviral therapeutic in poultry.","Arslan, Mehboob; Yang, Xin; Santhakumar, Diwakar; Liu, Xingjian; Hu, Xiaoyuan; Munir, Muhammad; Li, Yinü; Zhang, Zhifang",Genes (Basel),18,1

The Egyptian rousette bat (ERB) is a natural reservoir host for the marburgviruses and evidence suggests that bats are also natural reservoirs for the ebolaviruses. Although the search for the natural reservoirs of the ebolaviruses has largely involved serosurveillance of the bat population, there are no validated serological assays to screen bat sera for ebolavirus-specific IgG antibodies. Here, we generate filovirus-specific antisera by prime-boost immunization of groups of captive ERBs with all seven known culturable filoviruses. After validating a system of filovirus-specific indirect ELISAs utilizing infectious-based virus antigens for detection of virus-specific IgG antibodies from bat sera, we assess the level of serological cross-reactivity between the virus-specific antisera and heterologous filovirus antigens. This data is then used to generate a filovirus antibody fingerprint that can predict which of the filovirus species in the system is most antigenically similar to the species responsible for past infection. Our filovirus IgG indirect ELISA system will be a critical tool for identifying bat species with high ebolavirus seroprevalence rates to target for longitudinal studies aimed at establishing natural reservoir host-ebolavirus relationships.","Schuh, Amy J.; Amman, Brian R.; Sealy, Tara S.; Flietstra, Timothy D.; Guito, Jonathan C.; Nichol, Stuart T.; Towner, Jonathan S.",Sci Rep,18,1
3839,3839,3839,Dose-dependent effects of chronic alcohol drinking on peripheral immune responses,12.5028105,7.423616,2019-05-24,"It is well established that chronic heavy alcohol drinking (CHD) results in significant organ damage, increased susceptibility to infections, and poor outcomes following injury. In contrast, chronic moderate drinking (CMD) has been associated with improved cardiovascular health and immunity. These differential outcomes have been linked to alterations in both innate and adaptive branches of the immune system; however, the mechanisms remain poorly understood. To address this question, we determined the impact of chronic drinking on the transcriptional and functional responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) collected from male rhesus macaques classified as CMD or CHD after 12 months of voluntary ethanol self-administration. Our analysis suggests that chronic alcohol drinking, regardless of dose alters resting transcriptomes of PBMC, with the largest impact seen in innate immune cells. These transcriptional changes are partially explained by alterations in microRNA profiles. Additionally, chronic alcohol drinking is associated with a dose dependent heightened inflammatory profiled at resting and following LPS stimulation. Moreover, we observed a dose-dependent shift in the kinetics of transcriptional responses to LPS. These findings may explain the dichotomy in clinical and immunological outcomes observed with moderate versus heavy alcohol drinking.","Sureshchandra, Suhas; Raus, Anthony; Jankeel, Allen; Ligh, Brian Jin Kee; Walter, Nicole A.

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that antibiotic resistance could cause 10 million deaths per year by 2050. Multidrug-resistant bacteria are the cause of infection in at least one in three people suffering from septicemia. While antibiotics are powerful agents against infectious diseases, the alarming increase in antibiotic resistance is of great concern. Alternatives are desperately needed, and nanotechnology provides a great opportunity to develop novel approaches for the treatment of infectious diseases. One of the most important factors in the prognosis of an infection caused by an antibiotic resistant bacteria is an early and rigorous diagnosis, jointly with the use of novel therapeutic systems that can specifically target the pathogen and limit the selection of resistant strains. Nanodiamonds can be used as antimicrobial agents due to some of their properties including size, shape, and biocompatibility, which make them highly suitable for the development of efficient and tailored nanotherapies, including vaccines or drug delivery systems. In this review, we discuss the beneficial findings made in the nanodiamonds field, focusing on diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases. We also highlight the innovative platform that nanodiamonds confer for vaccine improvement, drug delivery, and shuttle systems, as well as their role in the generation of faster and more sensitive clinical diagnosis.","Torres Sangiao, Eva; Holban, Alina Maria; Gestal, Mónica Cartelle",Materials (Basel),18,1

In addition, many of these compounds show interesting biological properties such as anti-human immunodeficiency virus activity. Garcinia parvifolia is used in traditional medicine. Currently, the antiviral activity of G. parvifolia is not known. METHODS: This study was conducted to determine the effects of ethyl acetate (45 L Ea), ethanol (45 L Et), and hexane (45 L H) leaf extracts of G. parvifolia on the infectivity of pseudorabies virus (PrV) in Vero cells. The antiviral effects of the extracts were determined by cytopathic effect (CPE), inhibition, attachment, and virucidal assays. RESULTS: The 50% cytotoxicity concentration (CC(50)) values obtained were 237.5, 555.0, and < 1.25 μg/mL for 45 L Ea, 45 L Et, and 45 L H, respectively. The 45 L Ea showed the greatest viral inhibition potency of 75% at 125 μg/mL. Both 45 L Ea and 45 l Et caused 100% residual viral inhibition at 250 μg/mL. The selectivity index values for 45 L Ea, 45 L Et, and 45 L H were 2.65, 1.75, and 0.10 showing that 45 L Ea had the greatest antiviral activity among the three extracts. CONCLUSION: This study showed that ethyl acetate is the best solvent to be used to obtain extract from G. parvifolia leaves with potent antiviral activities.","Adnan, Aziera; Allaudin, Zeenathul Nazariah; Hani, Homayoun; Loh, Hwei-San; Khoo, Teng-Jin; Ting, Kang Nee; Abdullah, Rasedee",BMC Complement Altern Med,18,8

Evolutionary adaptations would have been required to survive the elevated body temperatures during flight. Heat shock protein (HSP), highly conserved master regulators of cell stress, expression was examined across tissues and various cell lines in bats. Basal expression level of major HSPs (HSP70 and HSP90) is significantly higher in two different bat species compared to other mammals. This HSP expression could be a bat-unique, key factor to modulate cellular stress and death. Consequently, bat cells survive prolonged heat treatment, along with other stress stimuli, in a HSP-dependent manner, whereas other mammalian cells succumbed. This suggests HSP expression in bats could be an important adaption to intrinsic metabolic stresses like flight and therefore an important model to study stress resilience and longevity in general.

Serum exosomes are nanovesicles that have multiple biological functions, playing roles in antigen presentation, intercellular signal communication, inflammatory response and immune surveillance. However, the biological functions and related molecular bases remain to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated the profiles of cytokines/chemokines harbored in the exosomes of septic mice and explored the mechanisms of immunomodulation on T cells treated with exosomes harvested from septic mice. Blood cytokines/chemokines existed in both the soluble form and in the insoluble exosomal form; the profiles of the cytokines/chemokines in these two forms displayed different dynamics in the blood of mice challenged with LPS. Exosomes from septic mice induced the differentiation of Th1/Th2 cells, which was blocked by specific antibodies targeting IL-12 and IL-4. In addition, these exosomes significantly augmented the proliferation and migration of T lymphocytes. Furthermore, preadministration of exosomes by intravenous injection restrained the inflammatory response, attenuated lung and liver tissue damage, and prolonged the survival of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mice. Our results indicate that exosomes enriched with cytokines/chemokines play critical roles in T cell differentiation, proliferation and chemotaxis during the sepsis process and have a protective effect on cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mice. Thus, these findings not only strengthen our understanding of the role of sepsis via exosomes but also provide potential targets for therapeutic applications.","Gao, Kun; Jin, Jingmiao; Huang, Chenyang; Li, Jianhang; Luo, Haihua; Li, Lei; Huang, Yukai; Jiang, Yong",Front Immunol,18,1

This mutation is loss-of-function, unlike the variants found in a homozygous state in public databases. We show that human IL-18 and IL-18BP are both secreted mostly by hepatocytes and macrophages in the liver. Moreover, in the absence of IL-18BP, excessive NK cell activation by IL-18 results in uncontrolled killing of human hepatocytes in vitro. Inherited human IL-18BP deficiency thus underlies fulminant HAV hepatitis by unleashing IL-18. These findings provide proof-of-principle that FVH can be caused by single-gene inborn errors that selectively disrupt liver-specific immunity.

Though murine models have been instrumental in understanding the functional role of MIF in different pathological conditions, the information obtained from these models is biased towards a specific species. In experimental science, results obtained from multiple clinically relevant animal models always provide convincing data that might recapitulate in humans. Syrian golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus), is a clinically relevant animal model for multiple human diseases. Hence, the major objectives of this study were to characterize the structure and function of Mesocricetus auratus MIF (MaMIF) and finally evaluate its effect on pancreatic tumor growth in vivo. Initially, the recombinant MaMIF was cloned, expressed and purified in a bacterial expression system. The MaMIF primary sequence, biochemical properties, and crystal structure analysis showed greater similarity with human MIF. The crystal structure of MaMIF illustrates that it forms a homotrimer as known in human and mouse. However, MaMIF exhibits some minor structural variations when compared to human and mouse MIF. The in vitro functional studies show that MaMIF has tautomerase activity and enhances activation and migration of hamster peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Interestingly, injection of MaMIF into HapT1 pancreatic tumor-bearing hamsters significantly enhanced the tumor growth and tumor-associated angiogenesis. Together, the current study shows a structural and functional similarity between the hamster and human MIF. Moreover, it has demonstrated that a high level of circulating MIF originating from non-tumor cells might also promote pancreatic tumor growth in vivo.","Suresh, Voddu; Sundaram, Rajivgandhi; Dash, Pujarini; Sabat, Surendra Chandra; Mohapatra, Debasish; Mohanty, Sneha; Vasudevan, Dileep; Senapati, Shantibhusan",Sci Rep,18,11

Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase that is involved in cell growth and intracellular signal transduction pathways. This study explored the potential role of FAK in AECs during lung injury induced by mechanical ventilation. High-volume mechanical ventilation (HMV) was used to create a mouse lung injury model, which was validated by analysis of lung weight, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and histological investigation. The expression of FAK and Akt in AECs were evaluated. In addition, recombinant FAK was administered to mice via the tail vein, and then the extent of lung injury was assessed. Mouse AECs were cultured in vitro, and FAK expression in cells under stretch was investigated. The effects of FAK on cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis were investigated. The results showed that HMV decreased FAK expression in AECs of mice, while FAK supplementation attenuated lung injury, reduced protein levels/cell counts in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and decreased histological lung injury and oedema. The protective effect of FAK promoted AEC proliferation and migration and prevented cells from undergoing apoptosis, which restored the integrity of the alveoli through Akt pathway. Therefore, the decrease in FAK expression by HMV is essential for injury to epithelial cells and the disruption of alveolar integrity. FAK supplementation can reduce AEC injury associated with HMV.","Fang, Mingxing; Liu, Na; Yao, Xiaoguang; Xu, Tieling; Wang, Zhiyong",Sci Rep,18,8

The pattern of sequence variation in felids supports the role of the following factors in production and maintenance of MHC variation: (1) gradual spontaneous mutation; (2) selective pressure to conserve certain residues but also to vary in hypervariable regions, notably residues that functionally participate in antigen recognition and presentation; and (3) recombination-mediated gene exchange between alleles and between related genes. The overall amount of genetic variation observed among MHC class I genes in the Felidae family is no greater than the amount of variation within any outbred cat species (i.e., domestic cat, ocelot). The occurrence of equivalent levels of polymorphism plus the simultaneous persistence of the same sequence motifs in divergent feline species suggest that most MHC class I nucleotide site polymorphism predated species divergences. Ancient polymorphisms have been transmitted through the speciation events and modern feline MHC class I alleles were derived by recombinational exchange of polymorphic sequence motifs. Moreover, some of these sequence motifs were found in other mammalian MHC class I genes, such as classical human HLA-B5, nonclassical human HLA-E class I genes, and bovine class I genes. These results raise the prospect of an ancient origin for some motifs, although the possibility of convergence in parallel mammalian radiations cannot be excluded.","Yuhki, Naoya; O'Brien, Stephen J.",J Mol Evol,18,17

A resulting construct with a Bar gene cassette for bialaphos selection in plant (rpE-VP2) was introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciensby electroporation. Agrobacterium containing the rpE-VP2 construct was used to transform Ar. thaliana and transgenic plants were selected using bialaphos. The presence of VP2 transgene in plants was confirmed by PCR and Southern blot analysis and its expression was confirmed by RT-PCR. Western blot analysis and antigen-capture ELISA assay using monoclonal anti-VP2 were used to determine the expression of VP2 protein in transgenic plants. The level of VP2 protein in the leaf extracts of selected transgenic plants varied from 0.5% to 4.8% of the total soluble protein. Recombinant VP2 protein produced in plants induced antibody response against IBDV in orally-fed chickens.","Wu, H.; Singh, N.K.; Locy, R.D.; Scissum-Gunn, K.; Giambrone, J.J.",Biotechnol Lett,18,22

A simulation model was developed to predict morbidity and mortality due to influenza and its specified complications, comparing neuraminidase inhibitors with usual care in an otherwise healthy adult population. Robustness of the results was tested by one-way and multiway as well as probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Treatment with either neuraminidase inhibitor results in reduced morbidity and faster return to normal activities. However, oseltamivir dominates zanamivir in cost-utility analysis due to its lower costs. Comparing oseltamivir with usual care, the costs are £14.36 per day of normal activity gained and £5,600 per quality-adjusted life-year gained from the healthcare payer perspective. Oseltamivir dominates usual care from the societal perspective. Treatment with oseltamivir is a cost-effective strategy for otherwise healthy adults in the UK from both the healthcare payer and societal perspective.","Sander, Beate; Gyldmark, Marlene; Hayden, Frederick G.; Morris, James; Mueller, Elvira; Bergemann, Rito",Eur J Health Econ,18,8

There is an available vaccination program for preventing rotavirus infection, but it has limits and restrictions. Probiotics therapy could be an alternative method of antiviral prevention and modulation against rotavirus infection. In this study, we screened the antiviral activity of probiotic bacteria such as 3 Lactobacillus spp. and 14 Bifidobacterium spp. isolated from young Korean. Three of the bacteria, Lactobacillus ruminis SPM0211, Bifidobacterium longum SPM1205, and SPM1206, inhibited human strain Wa rotavirus infection in Caco-2 cells. Furthermore, these bacterial strains inhibited rotavirus replication in a rotavirus-infected neonatal mouse model. To clarify the mechanism of inhibition, we investigated gene expression of Interferon (IFN)-signaling components and IFN-inducible antiviral effectors. All 3 probiotics increased IFN-α and IFN-β levels compared with the control. Gene expression of IFNsignaling components and IFN-inducible antiviral effectors also increased. Overall, these results indicate that L. ruminis SPM0211, B. longum SPM1205 and 1206 efficiently inhibit rotavirus replication in vitro and in vivo. Especially, the antiviral effect of Lactobacillus ruminis SPM0211 is worthy of notice. This is the first report of L. ruminis with antiviral activity. Anti-rotaviral effects of the 3 probiotics are likely due to their modulation of the immune response through promoting type I IFNs, which are key regulators in IFN signaling pathway.","Kang, Joo Yeon; Lee, Do Kyung; Ha, Nam Joo; Shin, Hea Soon",J Microbiol,18,11

I examine the different medical theories of disease that existed in Britain and America in the nineteenth century as each country began to develop its public health system. I also examine where in the state apparatus disease control was located in each country. In Britain disease control was historically part of the welfare sector of the state, while in the United States it was originally operated by the military. These different starting conditions helped push Britain and the United States along different paths of disease control and this helps explain why they respond to contemporary diseases in such different ways.

Additionally, a chest x‑ray, an ultrasound of the abdomen and an electrocardiogram (ECG) provide information about organ involvement. Recently, specialized laboratories use molecular techniques (multiplex PCR) to detect worm eggs and intestinal parasites in the stool, which provide a significantly higher sensitivity than traditional stool examination techniques.

Large clinical trials evaluating the blockade of the RAS with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers have demonstrated an ability to prevent progression and induce regression of left ventricular mass, thereby reducing the significant and independent cardiovascular risk conferred by LVH.

6776,6776,6776,Role of endothelial cell survival and death signals in angiogenesis,12.604023,7.6713443,1999,"Asthma and COPD are chronic inflammatory conditions that affect hundreds of millions of patients worldwide. New therapeutics are desperately needed, especially those that target the underlying causes and prevent disease progression. Although asthma and COPD have distinct etiologies, both are associated with reduced airflow caused by excess infiltration of inflammatory cells into healthy lung tissues. As selectin-mediated adhesion of leukocytes to the vascular endothelium is a key early event in the initiation of the inflammatory response, selectin inhibition is thought to be a good target for therapeutic intervention. Three known selectins are expressed in distinct subsets of cells: P-selectin is presented on the surface of activated platelets and endothelial cells, L-selectin is constitutively expressed on leukocytes, and E-selectin synthesis is upregulated in activated endothelial cells. They mediate cell-cell adhesion in the shear flow of the bloodstream via specialized interactions with clusters of oligosaccharides presented on cell surface glycopeptide ligands. The role of selectin-ligand interactions in the inflammatory response has been demonstrated in various animal models, prompting considerable attention from the pharmaceutical industry. Drug discovery efforts have yielded many different classes of selectin inhibitors, including soluble protein ligands, antibodies, oligosaccharides and small molecules. Although many selectin inhibitors have shown activity in preclinical models, clinical progress of selectin-directed therapies has been slow. Early approaches employed carbohydrate-based inhibitors to mimic the natural ligand sialyl Lewis X; however, these compounds proved challenging to develop. Cytel’s CY 1503, a complex oligosaccharide, progressed to phase II/III trials for reperfusion injury, but further development was halted when it failed to demonstrate clinical efficacy. Two protein-based selectin inhibitors have reached phase II development. These included Wyeth’s recombinant soluble P-selectin ligand, TSI (PSGL-1), which was discontinued after disappointing results in myocardial infarction trials and Protein Design Labs’ humanized anti-L-selectin monoclonal antibody, which is currently in development for trauma. Bimosiamose, discovered by Encysive Pharmaceutical and presently being developed by Revotar Biopharmaceuticals, is an 863 g/mol molecular weight dimer with minimal carbohydrate content and is, to date, the leading selectin inhibitor in clinical development. This compound has shown promise in a phase Ha ‘proof of concept’ trial in patients with asthma, reducing airway recruitment of eosinophils after intravenous administration. Further clinical development of an inhaled formulation is underway. Despite a significant need for new therapeutics, selectin inhibitors have not yet been explored for the treatment of COPD. Bimosiamose represents an important proof of principle, and hopefully continued success will spark renewed interest in selectin-directed therapeutics for respiratory diseases.","Romano, Suzanne J.",Treat Respir Med,18,8

This article reviews reports of perinatal and breast milk transmission of ZIKV and summarizes current clinical outcome data of pediatric non-congenital ZIKV infection. RECENT FINDINGS: Perinatal transmission and presence of infective ZIKV particles in breast milk have been reported. Most symptomatic non-congenital ZIKV infection in infants and children is mild and self-limited, but long-term follow-up studies are lacking. SUMMARY: The mechanism and impact of perinatal and breast milk transmission is unclear. The current WHO infant feeding guidelines in areas of ZIKV transmission support breastfeeding. Unless any scientific data raise concern regarding transmission via breastfeeding, the current guidelines should continue to be followed.

The present study reports the antiarthritic efficacy of the xanthine oxidase inhibitor and immunosuppressant allopurinol in DBA/1xB10A(4r) mice suffering from peroxochromateinduced arthritis. A profound dose-dependent suppression of arthritis was noted (P <0.001). The ED(50) was 80±14μmol/kg/day. The arthritis index correlated positively to the phagocytic production of oxygen radicals (r (2)>0.672) and negatively to the concentration of allopurinol (r (2)=0.915). Ex vivo, allopurinol and various conventional antirheumatic drugs were screened for the inhibition of 12-otetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-stimulated whole human blood chemiluminescence. The concentrations of antirheumatic drugs required to inhibit the chemiluminescence by 50% were compared to the therapeutic doses administered to rheumatic patients. Whiled-penicillamine andcis-platinum(II) increased the phagocytic generation of superoxide, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), steroids, and slow-acting antirheumatic drugs (SAARDs) inhibited the whole blood chemiluminescence in a dose-dependent manner. Therapeutic doses of NSAIDs, SAARDs, or steroids inhibited the phagocytic generation of reactive oxygen species by 10–50%. In addition to well-known mechanisms of action of NSAIDs and SAARDs, our results support the hypothesis that most common anti-rheumatic drugs act also by modulating the levels of reactive oxygen species, which serve important mediator and signal transduction functions in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Pharmacologically safe antioxidants like allopurinol, which simultaneously modify the oxidative burst of phagocytes, inhibit xanthine oxidase, and display immunosuppressive effects may well be suited to control the consequences of chronic phagocytic hyperreactivity in rheumatic patients.","Miesel, Ralf; Zuber, Margit; Sanocka, Dorota; Graetz, Regina; Kroeger, Hans",Inflammation,18,22

Parkin translocates from the cytosol to depolarized mitochondria, ubiquitinates outer mitochondrial membrane proteins and induces selective autophagy of the damaged mitochondria (mitophagy). Here, we show that ubiquitin-specific protease 15 (USP15), a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) widely expressed in brain and other organs, opposes Parkin-mediated mitophagy, while a panel of other DUBs and a catalytically inactive version of USP15 do not. Moreover, knockdown of USP15 rescues the mitophagy defect of PD patient fibroblasts with PARK2 mutations and decreased Parkin levels. USP15 does not affect the ubiquitination status of Parkin or Parkin translocation to mitochondria, but counteracts Parkin-mediated mitochondrial ubiquitination. Knockdown of the DUB CG8334, the closest homolog of USP15 in Drosophila, largely rescues the mitochondrial and behavioral defects of parkin RNAi flies.

METHODS: Peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PPMOs) are antisense agents that enter cells readily and interfere with gene expression. Four PPMOs, targeting various locations in the JEV genome, were evaluated for antiviral activity against JEV in cultured cells and the mouse model of JEV infection. RESULTS: A PPMO (P10882) targeting the JEV 3′ cyclization sequence (3′CSI) had significant antiviral activity in Vero (epithelial), Neuro2A (neuronal) and J774E (macrophage) cells at concentrations that were not cytotoxic. P10882 added before infection suppressed JEV replication to an undetectable level in Vero cells and produced a 93% and 66% reduction in titre in J774E and Neuro2A cells, respectively, when measured at 24 h post-infection. In uninfected cells, fluorescein-labelled PPMOs entered J774E cells most efficiently, followed by Vero and Neuro2A cells. The antiviral effect of P10882 was also demonstrated in vivo, where 60%–80% of 1-week-old mice treated intracerebrally with a 20 mg/kg dose of P10882 every 12 h for 5 days were protected from a lethal dose of JEV and showed an undetectable level of virus in brain tissue at 2 days post-infection. CONCLUSIONS: P10882, which targets sequence that is highly conserved across members of the JEV serocomplex, was previously shown to be effective in a mouse model of West Nile disease, and represents a candidate antiviral agent against members of the JEV serocomplex.","Anantpadma, Manu; Stein, David A.; Vrati, Sudhanshu",J Antimicrob Chemother,18,28

Performed ex vivo, cell fusion is a versatile research and therapeutic tool for gene mapping, antibody production, discovering new mechanisms in biological processes, inventing alternative therapies for cell reprogramming, restoring organ function, and creating cellular therapeutics for cancer treatment. Cell fusion can be successfully applied by creating cellular therapeutic of donor – recipient chimeric cell (DRCC) in the field of solid organ and vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA). Immunomodulatory DRCC therapy has the potential to reduce or even eliminate the need for toxic, life-long immunosuppression and to prevent both acute and chronic rejection. This innovative VCA treatment is a combination of ex vivo created chimeric cell therapy with a short-term selective protocol of monoclonal antibody and Cyclosporine A. The utilization of short-term immunosuppressive protocol will provide the opportunity for chimeric cell engraftment, proliferation, and re-education of recipient’s immune system resulting in prolongation of allograft survival.

Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of CAP, enclosing the subset group of patients having severe disease [2]. Moreover, bacteremia is not uncommon in pneumococcal CAP (20%) and has been associated with increased severity and mortality compared with non-bacteremic pneumonia [3].","Luján, M.; Muñoz-Almagro, C.; Rello, J.",Intensive Care Medicine,18,1

Among the various methodologies, one way for doing so is to affinity select peptide ligands from a phage-displayed combinatorial peptide library and then to examine if the proteins that carry such peptide sequences interact with the target protein in the cell. With the protocols described in this chapter, a laboratory with skills in microbiology, molecular biology, and protein biochemistry can readily identify peptides in the library that bind selectively, and with micromolar affinity, to a given target protein on the time scale of 2 months. To illustrate this approach, we use a library of bacteriophage M13 particles, which display 12-mer combinatorial peptides, to affinity select different peptide ligands for two different targets, the SH3 domain of the human Lyn protein tyrosine kinase and a segment of the yeast serine/threonine protein kinase Cbk1. The binding properties of the selected peptide ligands are then dissected by sequence alignment, Kunkel mutagenesis, and alanine scanning. Finally, the peptide ligands can be used to predict cellular interacting proteins and serve as the starting point for drug discovery.","Kokoszka, Malgorzata E.; Kay, Brian K.",Peptide Libraries,18,5

The liver has emerged as the major organ participating in the degradation and elimination of arachidonate products of systemic origin. The synthesis in the liver of arachidonate products derived from the cfyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase and cytochrome P450 system pathways has been demonstrated. The participation of leukotriene B(4) and cysteinyl-leukotrienes as mediators of liver damage and the possible therapeutic usefulness of prostaglandins (PGs) in acute liver injury has attracted the interest of clinicians. This article reviews the essential features regarding the role of arachidonate metabolites in liver disease and specially focuses on the cytoprotective effects on the liver displayed by PGE(2), PGE(1), PGI(2) and synthetic PG analogs in experimental models of liver damage induced by ischemia-reperfusion injury, carbon tetrachloride, bacterial lipopolysaccharide and viral hepatitis and on the possible mechanisms underlying liver cytoprotection in these experimental models. The therapeutic usefulness of PGs in clinical practice is critically analyzed on the basis of available evidence in patients with fulminant hepatic failure and primary graft nonfunction following liver transplantation.","Quiroga, Jorge; Prieto, Jesus",Pharmacol Ther,18,1

The impaired balance of the low-frequency/high-frequency ratio obtained from spectral components of RR intervals can be a diagnostic test for sepsis. In addition, it is known that a reduction of heart rate variability (HRV) is useful in identifying septic patients at risk of the development of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). We have reported a non-contact method using a microwave radar to monitor the heart and respiratory rates of a healthy person placed inside an isolator or of experimental animals exposed to toxic materials. APPARATUS DESIGN AND TESTING. With the purpose of preventing secondary exposure of medical personnel to toxic materials under biochemical hazard conditions, we designed a novel apparatus for non-contact measurement of HRV using a 1215 MHz microwave radar, a high-pass filter, and a personal computer. The microwave radar monitors only the small reflected waves from the subject's chest wall, which are modulated by the cardiac and respiratory motion. The high-pass filter enhances the cardiac signal and attenuates the respiratory signal. In a human trial, RR intervals derived from the non-contact apparatus significantly correlated with those derived from ECG (r=0.98, P<0.0001). The non-contact apparatus showed a similar power spectrum of RR intervals to that of ECG. CONCLUSIONS. Our non-contact HRV measurement apparatus appears promising for future pre-hospital monitoring of septic patients or for predicting MODS patients, inside isolators or in the field for mass casualties under biochemical hazard circumstances.","Matsui, T.; Arai, I.; Gotoh, S.; Hattori, H.; Takase, B.; Kikuchi, M.; Ishihara, M.",Biomed Pharmacother,18,33

Six nursing home norovirus outbreaks occurring in South Carolina, U.S. from 2014 to 2016 were examined. We aimed to quantify the contribution of symptoms and other case characteristics in norovirus transmission using the reproduction number (R(Ei)) as an estimate of individual case infectivity and to examine how transmission changes over the course of an outbreak. Individual estimates of R(Ei) were calculated using a maximum likelihood procedure to infer the average number of secondary cases generated by each case. The associations between case characteristics and R(Ei) were estimated using a weighted multivariate mixed linear model. Outbreaks began with one to three index case(s) with large estimated R(Ei)’s (range: 1.48 to 8.70) relative to subsequent cases. Of the 209 cases, 155 (75%) vomited, 164 (79%) had diarrhea, and 158 (76%) were nursing home residents (vs. staff). Cases who vomited infected 2.12 (95% CI: 1.68, 2.68) times the number of individuals as non-vomiters, cases with diarrhea infected 1.39 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.87) times the number of individuals as cases without diarrhea, and resident-cases infected 1.53 (95% CI: 1.15, 2.02) times the number of individuals as staff-cases. Index cases tended to be residents (vs. staff) who vomited and infected considerably more secondary cases compared to non-index cases. Results suggest that individuals, particularly residents, who vomit are more infectious and tend to drive norovirus transmission in U.S. nursing home norovirus outbreaks. While diarrhea also plays a role in norovirus transmission, it is to a lesser degree than vomiting in these settings. Results lend support for prevention and control measures that focus on cases who vomit, particularly if those cases are residents.","Adams, Carly; Young, David; Gastañaduy, Paul A.; Paul, Prabasaj; Marsh, Zach; Hall, Aron J.; Lopman, Benjamin A.",PLoS Comput Biol,18,20

Its antiparasitic effect is that of a schizontocide and is explained by rapid uptake by parasitized erythrocytes and interaction with a component of hemoglobin degradation resulting in formation of free radicals. It has been shown to exhibit a high clinical cure rate. Previous animal safety studies with Qinghaosu derivatives revealed dose-dependent neurotoxicity with movement disturbances and neuropathic changes in the hindbrain of intramuscularly treated dogs, rats and monkeys. Such effects have not been seen in man. The objective of our present studies was to compare the effects of high levels of AM administered to dogs p.o. versus i.m. In a pilot study 20 mg/kg/day of AM was given i.m. to groups of 3 male Beagle dogs for 5 and 30 days, respectively. Clinical signs of neurotoxicity were noted in some individual dogs from test day 23 on. One dog had to be sacrificed pre-term. Hematologic findings indicated a hypochromic, microcytic anemia. Microscopic examination demonstrated neuropathic changes only at 30 days, but not at 5 days. The animals had neuronal and secondary axonal damage, most prominent in the cerebellar roof, pontine and vestibular nuclei, and in the raphe/paralemniscal region. The affected neurons showed loss of Nissl substance, cytoplasmic eosinophilia, shrinkage of the nucleus and in advanced stages scavenging by microglia. In a subsequent experiment, AM was administered to groups of 4 male and 4 female dogs, respectively, at 8 daily doses of 0, 20, 40 and 80 mg/kg i.m., or 0, 50, 150 and 600 mg/kg p.o. Neurologic signs were seen at high i.m. doses only. In most animals they were inconspicuous and consisted of reduced activity with convulsions seen in single dogs shortly before death. Neuronal damage occurred in all animals at 40 and 80 mg/kg following i.m. treatment. At 20 mg/kg minimal effects occurred in 5/8 dogs only, indicating that this level was close to tolerated exposure. No comparable lesions were observed after oral administration. Both i.m. and p.o. exposure at high dose levels was associated with a prolongation of mean QT interval of ECG, suggesting slowing of repolarization of the myocardium. Individual data indicated that in 1 of 4 females at 80 mg/kg i.m. this prolongation was above the 25 % level considered as threshold for concern. After intramuscular administration pharmacokinetics indicated peak plasma levels of AM at 2 to 4 hours post-dose, slow elimination and a tendency to accumulate after repeated administration. Only low levels of the major metabolite, dihydroartemisinin (DHA), were found. AM levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were < 10 % of plasma levels. After oral administration AM concentrations were considerably lower than after i.m. administration. The concentration of DHA was high on day 1 but almost nil on day 7 indicating its fast inactivation in dogs. Two hours after the 8(th) oral administration neither AM nor DHA was detected in CSF which may explain the absence of neurotoxicity in dogs after oral administration of AM.","Classen, W.; Altmann, B.; Gretener, P.; Souppart, C.; Skelton-Stroud, P.; Krinke, G.",Exp Toxicol Pathol,18,1

Each dust sample was analyzed for the 36 molds that make up the ERMI. The concentration of 2.5‐μm particulate matter (PM (2.5)) was measured in each school at two locations during the spring of 2013. RESULTS: The average ERMI value in the Springfield school, 15.51, was significantly greater (p < 0.001) than the average ERMI value, −2.87, in the Idaho schools. Ten of the twenty‐six Group 1 molds, which are associated with water‐damaged environments, were in significantly greater concentrations in the Springfield school. The populations of Group 2 molds, which are common indoors even without water damage, were essentially the same in Springfield and Idaho schools. The average PM (2.5) concentration in the Springfield and Idaho schools was 11.6 and 3.4 μg/m(3), respectively.

Despite advancing technology of surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF), treatment and indications remain controversial. Lack of displacement is often cited as a reason for non-operative management. The purpose was to examine RF patterns hypothesizing RF become more displaced over time. METHODS: Retrospective review of all RF patients from 2016–2017 at our institution. Patients with initial chest CT (CT1) followed by repeat CT (CT2) within 84 days were included. Basic demographics were obtained. Primary outcomes included RF displacement in millimeters (mm) between CT1 and CT2 in three planes (AP = anterior/posterior, O = overlap/gap, and SI = superior/inferior). Displacement was calculated by subtracting CT1 fracture displacement from CT2 displacement for each rib. Given anatomic and clinical characteristics, ribs were grouped (1–2, 3–6, 7–10, 11–12), averaged, and analyzed for displacement. Secondary outcome included number of missed RF on CT1. Non-parametric sign test and paired t test were used for analysis. Significance was set at p < 0.002. RESULTS: 78 of 477 patients with RF on CT1 had CT2 during the study period: primarily male (76%) and age 55.8 ± 20.1 with blunt mechanism of injury (99%). Median Injury Severity Score was 21 (IQR, 13–27) with Chest Abbreviated Injury Score of 3 (IQR, 3–4). Median time between CT1 and CT2 was 6 days (IQR, 3–12). Missed RF rate for CT1 was 10.1% (p = 0.11). Average fracture displacement was significantly increased for all rib groupings except 11–12 in all planes (p < 0.002). CONCLUSION: RF become more displaced over time.

Dengue fever is not endemic in Taiwan; the importation of dengue viruses from neighboring countries via close commercial links and air travel is considered to be the cause of local outbreaks. Therefore, efforts toward disease control have focused on preventing the importation of dengue into Taiwan. In this study, we investigated the relationships between the numbers of imported and indigenous dengue cases to test the validity of this strategy. METHODS: Data on cases of dengue fever that occurred between 2013 and 2018 were obtained from the surveillance systems of the Taiwan Center for Disease Control and Kaohsiung City Health Department. Standard epidemiological data, including the monthly numbers of indigenous and imported cases of dengue, were calculated. Potential associations between the numbers of indigenous and imported cases were investigated using correlation analyses. RESULTS: We identified a possible relationship between the period of disease concealment and the number of imported dengue cases, which resulted in epidemics of indigenous dengue fever within local communities. Further analysis of confirmed cases during previous epidemics in Kaohsiung City found that the risk of indigenous dengue fever may be related to the likelihood that patients with imported dengue fever will stay within local communities. CONCLUSION: Given the correlations found between imported and indigenous cases of dengue fever, as well as the relationship between the disease concealment period and the risk of indigenous dengue fever, prevention of disease importation and efficient identification of dengue cases within high-risk communities remain the major priorities for disease control.","Pan, Chao-Ying; Liu, Wei-Liang; Su, Matthew-P.; Chang, Te-Pin; Ho, Hui-Pin; Shu, Pei-Yun; Huang, Joh-Jong; Lin, Li-Jen; Chen, Chun-Hong",BMC Infect Dis,18,11

This diversity contributes to a number of phenotypes, including ancestry-specific disease risk and response to pathogens. Although the 1000 Genomes Project significantly improved our understanding of genetic variation globally, southern African populations are still severely underrepresented in biomedical and human genetic studies due to insufficient large-scale publicly available data. In addition to a lack of genetic data in public repositories, existing software, algorithms and resources used for imputation and phasing of genotypic data (amongst others) are largely ineffective for populations with a complex genetic architecture such as that seen in southern Africa.

In veterinary ophthalmology, little is known about keratometry in dogs, and its practical application has been limited. The present study aimed to describe keratometry in some dog breeds popular in Japan using a handheld keratometer. METHODS: Client-owned dogs of various signalment were enrolled prospectively in the keratometry examination. Interbreed variations in mean corneal curvatures (R1R2avg) and corneal astigmatism (Δ(R1−R2)) were evaluated statistically with respect to their bodyweight based on the data which fulfilled the predetermined inclusion criteria. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: On examination of 237 dogs from 16 different breeds, R1R2avg (mean±sd) ranged from 7.54±0.30 mm in Pomeranians to 9.28±0.19 mm in golden retrievers. Δ(R1−R2) (mean±sd) ranged from 0.22±0.11 mm in miniature schnauzers to 0.57±0.30 mm in French bulldogs. CONCLUSION: The present study successfully described keratometry in 16 dog breeds. The study revealed considerable interbreed variations in both R1R2avg and Δ(R1−R2), which did not necessarily correlate with bodyweight. These results are useful both clinically in fitting contact lenses in the management of corneal diseases and non-clinically in optometric studies in dogs.","Kawasaki, Minae; Furujo, Tomoya; Kuroda, Kohei; Azuma, Kazuo; Okamoto, Yoshiharu; Ito, Norihiko",Vet Rec,18,1

Yet, a majority of Americans are living lives that are sedentary, lonely, and not connected with nature. We have three primary goals in writing this paper. First, we will review the well-documented health challenges arising from a sedentary, isolated lifestyle. Second, we will discuss the benefits of walking as a primary means of increasing physical activity. Finally, we will shine a light on the exponential success of Walk with a Doc, a national non-profit organization. Walk with a Doc focuses on bringing physician-led enthusiasm into our communities by organizing regular doctor-led walks in the outdoors; as well as Walk with a Future Doc, which encourages medical students to start their own Walk with a Doc programs. RECENT FINDINGS: The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans share that physical activity is an important action that people of all ages can take to improve their health. These guidelines recommend that adults partake in at least 150 min of moderate aerobic physical activity. Currently, only 23% of Americans are achieving this amount of aerobic activity. In addition, recent data suggest that 3 in 4 people are lonely, a significant social determinant of health. Finally, over half of all Americans spend fewer than 5 h outside each week. Walk with a Doc and Walk with a Future Doc are having an enormous impact on combating the negative effects of these health challenges. An evaluability assessment was completed in 2018 showing Walk with a Doc attendees felt the program increased their physical activity and their social connections, with a majority of Walk with a Doc gatherings occurring in nature. Physicians and other Walk with a Doc program leaders also reported high levels of satisfaction with their participation in Walk with a Doc. SUMMARY: As teammates in this healthcare fight, we are all painfully aware of the crisis on our hands. Of our patients, 70% are overweight or obese, nearly 80% of us are not getting enough physical activity, with all of this leading to billions of dollars in healthcare costs. Adding fuel to the fire, our doctors are burning out because of it. Today, we want to share what we have learned to be an extremely viable solution. The solution has the capacity to save 5 million lives and $68 billion dollars per year. Additionally, it is bolstering the job satisfaction and happiness of our providers. Personally, it turned my life around in 2005, and since then, it is now greater than 560 communities around the USA (and 34 other countries). We call it, simply, Walk with a Doc.","Sabgir, David; Dorn, Joan",Curr Cardiol Rep,18,8

The present study aimed to investigate the associated risk of T2D with obesity risk alleles of fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) and melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) genes. METHODS: The study includes 400 subjects (300 T2D diabetic cases and 100 healthy controls). Genetic analysis was done by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) methods. RESULTS: The findings of the study show no significant increase in odds of diabetes associated with the prevalence of FTO and MC4R minor alleles. Rare allele frequencies for “A” of FTO rs9939609 were 0.34 and 0.30 in cases and controls, respectively. Rare allele frequencies for A of MC4R rs12970134 were found to be more common in controls (0.45) than cases (0.41), but the difference was insignificant (p 0.246); however, an increase in body weight with the presence of allele “A” of the FTO gene (p value < 0.001) was found, indicating indirect involvement in the development of T2D. In addition, these were also correlated with the demographic/lifestyle and clinico-pathological parameters between T2D cases and controls. We found that T2D patients with a history of smoking and high consumption of alcohol, fast foods and sweetened beverages are at high risk of T2D compared to healthy controls (p < 0.01*). CONCLUSION: The present study concludes that there is no direct association of rs9939609 of the FTO gene with the occurrence of diabetes in the Indian population, but its role in T2D development cannot be overlooked altogether. Furthermore, we conclude that the rs9939609 of FTO carries a potential risk of obesity and because of this FTO rs9939609 T > A is widely considered an obesity-associated allele/single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP).","Khan, Shahbaz; Verma, Amit Kumar; Khan, Vasiuddin; Bhatt, Deepti; Rafat, Sahar; Alsahli, Mohammed A.; Rahmani, Arshad Husain; Meena, Babita; Naqvi, Irshad Husain; Dev, Kapil",Diabetes Ther,18,28

Our aim was to evaluate the relationship between maceration, PMI and body organ apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values in a cohort of subjects across a wide gestational range. MATERIALS: Whole body post-mortem MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequences were performed at 1.5 T, with b values of 0, 500 and 1000 mm(2)/s. Mean ADC values were calculated from regions of interest (ROIs) placed in the lungs, myocardium, spleen, renal cortex, liver and psoas muscle by two independent readers. Multivariable regression analysis was performed against PMI, gestational age, post-mortem weight, maceration score and gender. RESULTS: Eighty perinatal deaths were imaged with mean gestational age of 32 weeks (18–41 weeks), of which 49 (61.3%) were male. The mean PMI was 8 days (1–18 days). Maceration scores were statistically significant predictive factors for ADC values in all included body organs except the lungs, but PMI was not a predictor for ADC values in any body organ. In the absence of maceration (n = 14), PMI was not statistically associated with ADC values in any of the body areas. The ratio of agreement in the majority of body areas was close to 1 (range between 0.95 and 1.10). CONCLUSION: Maceration, not PMI, is significantly associated with ADC values in perinatal deaths. Further research is needed to understand organ-specific changes in the post-mortem period.","Shelmerdine, Susan C.; Main, Cheryl; Hutchinson, John Ciaran; Langan, Dean; Sebire, Neil J.; Arthurs, Owen J.",Int J Legal Med,18,8

Methods: Articles were searched in Web of Science, PubMed, and Ovid from inception up to 29 June 2020. Pooled sensitivity and specificity were calculated, each with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Quality assessment and heterogeneity evaluation across included studies were performed. Results: A total of 50 articles were included. The respective sensitivity and specificity were 87% (95% CI: 0.84–0.89), 91% (95% CI: 0.90–0.92) and 95% (95% CI: 0.93–0.97) in the adult BAL group; 90% (95% CI: 0.88–0.91), 98% (95% CI: 0.97–0.98) and 97% (95% CI: 0.95–0.99) in the adult ES group; 86% (95% CI: 0.84–0.89) and 97% (95% CI: 0.96–0.98) in the adult IS group. Xpert MTB/RIF showed the sensitivity and specificity of 14% (95% CI: 0.10–0.19) and 99% (95% CI: 0.97–1.00) in the pediatric ES group; 80% (95% CI: 0.72–0.87) and 94% (95% CI: 0.92–0.95) in the pediatric GA group; 67% (95% CI: 0.62–0.72) and 99% (95% CI: 0.98–0.99) in the pediatric IS group; and 54% (95% CI: 0.43–0.64) and 99% (95% CI: 0.97–0.99) in the pediatric NPA group. The heterogeneity across included studies was deemed acceptable. Conclusion: Considering diagnostic accuracy, cost and sampling process, ES was a better choice than other sample types for diagnosing adult PTB, especially HIV-associated PTB. GA might be more suitable than other sample types for diagnosing pediatric PTB. The actual choice of sample types should also consider the needs of specific situations.","Lyu, Mengyuan; Zhou, Jian; Cheng, Yuhui; Chong, Weelic; Wu, Kang; Fang, Teng; Fu, Tianbo; Ying, Binwu",Biosci Rep,18,33

However, the public faces several barriers to accessing research information, including paywalls and technical jargon. One method to bridge this gap between patients, families, and research is using lay summaries. SCAsource is an online knowledge translation platform where peer-reviewed research papers on ataxia are translated into lay summaries. This online platform was launched in September 2018, with the goal of making ataxia research more accessible and understandable to patients and families. A secondary goal is to provide opportunities for ataxia researchers to develop and hone their knowledge translation skills, altogether improving the quality of patient communication in the ataxia community. AIM: The aim of this study was to measure the impact of SCAsource on its readers and volunteer contributors after one year of activity. This is to ensure SCAsource is meeting its goals of (1) improving access and understanding of ataxia research to lay audiences, and (2) improving knowledge translation skills of volunteer contributors. METHODS: Two online surveys were launched, one for readers and one for volunteers. Each survey had a combination of multiple-choice, Likert-scale type, and open-ended short-answer questions. Descriptive quantitative analysis was used for respondent characteristics and Likert-type data. A grounded theory coding approach was used to analyze narrative feedback data. RESULTS: We found that SCAsource has mutually beneficial outcomes for both lay person readers and volunteer contributors. Readers have an increased understanding of ataxia research and access to up-to-date information on recent publications. Volunteers develop knowledge translation skills and have increased confidence in communicating results to lay audiences. Areas of improvement were identified to be incorporated into the platform. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that SCAsource improves access to information and understanding of research to lay audiences, while providing opportunities for researchers to develop knowledge translation skills. This framework can potentially be used by other rare disease organizations to launch and evaluate their own knowledge translation websites.","Suart, Celeste Elisabeth; Graham, Katherine Jean; Suart, Theresa Nowlan; Truant, Ray",PLoS One,18,1

However, little is known about the development and maintenance, as well as heterogeneity of immune cell exhaustion. Here, we investigated the effects of HIV infection on immune cell exhaustion at the transcriptomic level by analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from four healthy subjects (37,847 cells) and six HIV-infected donors (28,610 cells). We identified nine immune cell clusters and eight T cell subclusters, and three of these (exhausted CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and interferon-responsive CD8(+) T cells) were detected only in samples from HIV-infected donors. An inhibitory receptor KLRG1 was identified in a HIV-1 specific exhausted CD8(+) T cell population expressing KLRG1, TIGIT, and T-bet(dim)Eomes(hi) markers. Ex-vivo antibody blockade of KLRG1 restored the function of HIV-specific exhausted CD8(+) T cells demonstrating the contribution of KLRG1(+) population to T cell exhaustion and providing an immunotherapy target to treat HIV chronic infection. These data provide a comprehensive analysis of gene signatures associated with immune cell exhaustion during HIV infection, which could be useful in understanding exhaustion mechanisms and developing new cure therapies.","Wang, Shaobo; Zhang, Qiong; Hui, Hui; Agrawal, Kriti; Karris, Maile Ann Young; Rana, Tariq M.",,18,1

Despite being the subject of intermittent studies over the past few decades, comprehensive information on the epidemiology and control of TTBDis is lacking. Herein, we have systematically reviewed the current knowledge on TTBDis of small ruminants in Pakistan. Critical appraisal of the selected 71 articles published between 1947 to 2020 revealed that morphological examination had been the most widely used method for the identification of TTBDis in Pakistan. Tick fauna comprise at least 40 species, mainly belonging to Haemaphysalis, Hyalomma and Rhipicephalus. The prevalence of ticks is the highest in summer (June–September) and it is also higher in goats than sheep. Anaplasma, Babesia and Theileria spp. are the major tick-borne pathogens (TBPs), and their prevalence is usually higher in sheep than goats. Spatio-temporal distribution, genetic diversity and control of ticks and TBPs of small ruminants as well as the competence of tick vectors for various TBPs remain to be explored. Therefore, coordinated and focused investigations are required to fill knowledge gaps in these areas to maximise the health, production and welfare of small ruminants and minimise economic losses associated with TTBDis in Pakistan.","Ghafar, Abdul; Abbas, Tariq; Rehman, Abdul; Sandhu, Zia-ud-Din; Cabezas-Cruz, Alejandro; Jabbar, Abdul",Pathogens,18,1

Given the associated health risks of this behaviour, we aimed to investigate why young adults take up waterpipe tobacco smoking and their attitudes to the associated risks. Methods: This was a qualitative study, with a phenomenological perspective. Focus groups and face-to-face semi-structured interviews were conducted among waterpipe smokers aged 20–30 years living in London, UK. Transcripts were analysed using constant comparison and cycling between the data and analysis. Data collection continued until thematic saturation was achieved. Results: Sixteen smokers attended focus groups and face-to-face interviews. Seven main themes emerged encompassing four main dimensions relating to: lack of knowledge, perceived risk, affordability, and social addiction. Waterpipe was perceived to be safer than cigarette smoking due to the pleasant odour, fruity flavours, and belief that water filtered the toxins. The waterpipe had become a “social addiction” enhancing group atmosphere, was cheap and did not have the dangers of violence or hallucinations associated with other addictions like alcohol and drugs. Because of their intermittent smoking patterns and the lack of statutory warnings, none felt they were not at risk of any adverse side effects. Conclusions: Waterpipe smoking is a growing public health problem; the social environment associated with its use is perceived to be a positive outlet by smokers who do not consider it harmful to their health. These perceptions need to be addressed urgently by anti-smoking policies.","Dhillon, Amraj. Z.; Doran, Tim; Aggarwal, Vishal. R.",Dent J (Basel),18,8

The method uses high-throughput gene expression profiling data but can potentially use other omics data as well. According to the signaling pathway topology, the gene expression profiles are convoluted into the signaling pathway activities using a signaling pathway impact analysis (SPIA) method. The method was tested by inducing inflammation in human 3D epithelial tissues, including intestine, oral and skin, and then exposing these tissues to various extracts and then performing transcriptome analysis. The analysis showed a different efficiency of the various extracts in restoring the transcriptome changes to the pre-inflammation state, thus allowing to calculate a different cannabis drug efficiency index (CDEI).","Borisov, Nicolas; Ilnytskyy, Yaroslav; Byeon, Boseon; Kovalchuk, Olga; Kovalchuk, Igor",Int J Mol Sci,18,17

Patients eligible for surgery, increasingly receive neo-adjuvant therapy before surgery or adjuvant therapy afterward, inherently exposing them to toxicity. As such, optimizing physical function through exercise during treatment remains imperative to optimize quality of life either before surgery or during rehabilitation. However, current exercise efficacy and prescription in pancreatic cancer is unknown. Therefore, this study aims to summarise the published literature on exercise studies conducted in patients with pancreatic cancer undergoing treatment with a focus on determining the current prescription and progression patterns being used in this population. METHODS: A systematic review of four databases identified studies evaluating the effects of exercise on aerobic fitness, muscle strength, physical function, body composition, fatigue and quality of life in participants with pancreatic cancer undergoing treatment, published up to 24 July 2020. Two reviewers independently reviewed and appraised the methodological quality of each study. RESULTS: Twelve studies with a total of 300 participants were included. Heterogeneity of the literature prevented meta-analysis. Exercise was associated with improvements in outcomes; however, study quality was variable with the majority of studies receiving a weak rating. CONCLUSIONS: High quality evidence regarding the efficacy and prescription of exercise in pancreatic cancer is lacking. Well-designed trials, which have received feedback and input from key stakeholders prior to implementation, are required to examine the impact of exercise in pancreatic cancer on key cancer related health outcomes.

Our data suggest that diacylglycerol, which is enriched at sites of LD formation, promotes the packaging of NLs into LDs, together with ER-abundant lipids, such as phosphatidylethanolamine. On the opposite end, short and saturated acyl-chains antagonize fat storage in LDs and promote accumulation of NLs in the ER.

Gene expressions of CXCL10 and IFI44L were positively correlated with the level of norovirus RNA replication (CXCL10: Spearman’s r = 0.779, p < 0.05; IFI44L: r = 0.881, p < 0.01). The higher level of secreted CXCL10 and IFI44L proteins confirmed their elevated gene expression. The two genes have been reported to be upregulated in norovirus volunteer challenges and natural human infections by other viruses. Our data suggested that HIE could mimic the innate immune response elicited in natural norovirus infection and, therefore, could serve as an experimental model for future virus-host interaction and antiviral studies.","Chan, Jenny C.M.; Mohammad, Kirran N.; Zhang, Lin-Yao; Wong, Sunny H.; Chan, Martin Chi-Wai",Viruses,18,11

The use of mechanical ventilation helps to manage symptoms and delays death. Use in a home environment could reduce costs and increase quality of life. The aim of this study is a cost–utility analysis of home mechanical ventilation in adult patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis from the perspective of healthcare payers in the Czech Republic. The study evaluates home mechanical ventilation (HMV) and mechanical ventilation (MV) in a healthcare facility. A Markov model was compiled for evaluation in a timeframe of 10 years. Model parameters were obtained from the literature and opinions of experts from companies dealing with home care and home mechanical ventilation. The cost–utility analysis was carried out at the end of the study and results are presented in incremental cost–utility ratio (ICUR) using quality-adjusted life-years. Uncertainty was assessed by one-way sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis. The cumulative costs of HMV are CZK 1,877,076 and the cumulative costs of the MV are CZK 7,386,629. The cumulative utilities of HMV are 12.57 quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and the cumulative utilities of MV are 11.32 QALY. The ICUR value is CZK-4,403,259. The results of this study suggest that HMV is cost effective.","Gajdoš, Ondřej; Rožánek, Martin; Donin, Gleb; Kamenský, Vojtěch",Healthcare (Basel),18,1

It is traditionally used in combination with other traditional Chinese medicines to enhance immunity. This study showed that P. cocos extract (Lipucan(®)) containing lanostane triterpenoids has no immunotoxicity and enhances non-specific (innate) immunity though activating natural killer cells and promotes interferon γ (IFN-γ) secretion by Type 1 T-helper (Th1) cells immune response. In addition, P. cocos extract significantly decreased interleukin (IL-4 and IL-5) secretion by Type 2 T-helper (Th2) cells immune response, which are related to the allergy response. The purified lanostane triterpenoids were first identified as active ingredients of P. cocos with enhanced non-specific immunity by promoting interferon γ (IFN-γ) secretion in a preliminary study.

The present study represents an effort to correlate our previously reported biological activities with a computational study, including molecular docking, and ADME/T (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion/toxicity) analyses, to identify the phytochemicals that are potentially responsible for the antioxidant, antidepressant, anxiolytic, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory activities of this plant. In the gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy analysis, a total of 24 compounds were identified, seven of which were documented as being bioactive based on their binding affinities. These seven were subjected to molecular docking studies that were correlated with the pharmacological outcomes. Additionally, the ADME/T properties of these compounds were evaluated to determine their drug-like properties and toxicity levels. The seven selected, isolated compounds displayed favorable binding affinities to potassium channels, human serotonin receptor, cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), COX-2, nuclear factor (NF)-κB, and human peroxiredoxin 5 receptor proteins. Phytol acetate, and terpene compounds identified in E. papillosum displayed strong predictive binding affinities towards the human serotonin receptor. Furthermore, 3-trifluoroacetoxypentadecane showed a significant binding affinity for the KcsA potassium channel. Eicosanal showed the highest predicted binding affinity towards the human peroxiredoxin 5 receptor. All of these findings support the observed in vivo antidepressant and anxiolytic effects and the in vitro antioxidant effects observed for this extract. The identified compounds from E. papillosum showed the lowest binding affinities towards COX-1, COX-2, and NF-κB receptors, which indicated the inconsequential impacts of this extract against the activities of these three proteins. Overall, E. papillosum appears to be bioactive and could represent a potential source for the development of alternative medicines; however, further analytical experiments remain necessary.","Uddin, Md.

In this study, we used the whole genome sequences of 100 mink from the Canadian Centre for Fur Animal Research (CCFAR) at the Dalhousie Faculty of Agriculture (Truro, NS, Canada) and Millbank Fur Farm (Rockwood, ON, Canada) to investigate their population structure, genetic diversity and linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicated that the variation among color-types was significant (p < 0.001) and accounted for 18% of the total variation. The admixture analysis revealed that assuming three ancestral populations (K = 3) provided the lowest cross-validation error (0.49). The effective population size (Ne) at five generations ago was estimated to be 99 and 50 for CCFAR and Millbank Fur Farm, respectively. The LD patterns revealed that the average r(2) reduced to <0.2 at genomic distances of >20 kb and >100 kb in CCFAR and Millbank Fur Farm suggesting that the density of 120,000 and 24,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) would provide the adequate accuracy of genomic evaluation in these populations, respectively.

In many departments classroom teaching was no longer possible so that it was necessary to implement digital courses to provide an adequate medical training. METHODS: We developed a digital curriculum based on the contents of our established courses using primary in-house tools, such as Cisco WebEx and Moodle. We then performed a student survey to evaluate the implementation of the concept. RESULTS: The evaluation showed good ratings according to teaching content and didactics. The communication with the students and between each other was also considered good. Students assessed attention during the course to be equivalent in comparison to classroom teaching. As expected, the training of practical skills was evaluated as poor. For future courses most of the students could imagine a combination of digital and classroom teaching. DISCUSSION: Implementing a digital course was a sudden challenge for students and tutors. With suitable software solutions and good communication, it is possible to adequately teach theoretical content via digital courses. Students assessed the digital training in most parts to be a good and an equivalent option compared to classroom teaching.

METHODS: Participants included: 39 (28 females) community-dwelling older adults with insomnia, 34 (21 females) controls without insomnia. Subject groups were matched for age, gender, and education. Sleep quality was evaluated based on two-week actigraphy. Gait speed and cognition were assessed as ST and DT performance. DT costs (DTCs) were calculated for both tasks. Outcomes were compared via independent samples t-tests or Mann–Whitney U-tests. RESULTS: Older adults with insomnia demonstrated significantly slower gait speed during ST (1 ± 0.29 vs 1.27 ± 0.17 m/s, p<0.001) and DT (0.77 ± 0.26 vs 1.14 ± 0.20 m/s, p<0.001) and fewer correct responses in the cognitive task during ST (21 ± 7 vs 27 ± 11, p=0.009) and DT (19 ± 7 vs 23 ± 9, p=0.015) compared to control group. DTC for the gait task was higher among older adults with insomnia (18.32%, IQR: 9.48–30.93 vs 7.81% IQR: 4.43–14.82, p<0.001). However, no significant difference was observed in DTC for the cognitive task (14.71%, IQR: −0.89–38.84 vs 15%, IQR: −0.89–38.84%, p=0.599). CONCLUSION: Older adults with insomnia have lower gait speed and poorer cognitive performance during ST and DT and an inefficient pattern of task prioritization during walking, compared to counterparts without insomnia. These findings may explain the higher risk of falls among older adults with insomnia. Geriatric professionals should be aware of potential interrelationships between sleep and gait.","Kirshner, Dani; Kizony, Rachel; Gil, Efrat; Asraf, Kfir; Krasovsky, Tal; Haimov, Iris; Shochat, Tamar; Agmon, Maayan",Nat Sci Sleep,18,22

Its success depends on its interaction with the host and its ability to regulate the host’s immune system for its own survival. Mycobacterium tuberculosis H(37)Rv (Mtb) proteome consists of unique PE_PGRS family proteins, which present a significant role in bacterial pathogenesis over the past years. Earlier evidence suggests that some PE_PGRS proteins display fibronectin-binding activity. In this manuscript, computational characterization of the PE_PGRS39 protein has indicated something peculiar about this protein. Investigation showed that PE_PGRS39 is an extracellular protein that, instead of acting as fibronectin-binding protein, might mimic fibronectin which binds to alpha-5 beta-1 (α5β1) integrin. PE_PGRS39 protein additionally turned into proven pieces of evidence to have motifs such as DXXG and GGXGXD and PXXP that bind with guanosine triphosphate (GTP), calcium, and host Src homology 3 (SH3) domains, respectively, in conjunction with RGD-integrin binding. These interactions designate the direct role of PE_PGRS39 in bacterial pathogenesis via cell adhesion and signaling. Additionally, the analysis showed that PE_PGRS39 is an antigenic protein and epitope prediction provided functional regions of the protein that trigger a cellular immune response facilitated by T or B cells. Further, an experimental analysis could also open up new avenues for developing novel drugs by targeting signaling motifs or novel vaccines using functional epitopes that could evoke an immune response in the host.","Patni, Khyati; Agarwal, Preeti; Kumar, Ajit; Meena, Laxman S.",3 Biotech,18,17

RESULTS: Two DNA constructs containing SPPV117 coding sequence under the control of chloroplast promoter and terminator of psbA gene or rrn promoter and rbcL terminator were designed and inserted into the chloroplast genome by a biolistic method. The transgenic plants were selected via PCR analysis. Northern and Western blot analysis showed expression of the transgene at transcriptional and translational levels, respectively. The recombinant protein accumulated to about 0.3% and 0.9% of total soluble protein in leaves when expressed from psbA and rrn promoter, respectively. Plant-produced SPPV117 protein was purified using metal affinity chromatography and the protein yield was 19.67 ± 1.25 µg g(−1) (FW)(.)

By utilizing aspects of the body’s innate immune system, immunotherapy has improved life expectancy and quality of life for patients with several types of cancer. Adoptive cellular therapies, including chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR T) cell therapy, involve the genetic engineering of patient T cells to allow for targeting of neoplastic cells. Monitoring of patients during the lymphodepletion prior to therapy and following CAR T cell infusion is necessary to detect toxicity of therapy. Specific toxicities include cytokine release syndrome and neurologic toxicity, both of which may be life-threatening. Tocilizumab and/or corticosteroids should be considered for moderate to severe toxicity. Kinase inhibitor toxicity can occur as “on target” effects or “off target” effects to multiple organ systems due to shared protein epitopes. Treatments are organ-specific. Infusion reactions are common during treatment with monoclonal antibodies and treatment is largely supportive. Clinical experience with oncolytic viruses is limited, but local reactions including cellulitis as well as systemic influenza-like syndromes have been seen but are typically mild. Although clinical experience with adverse effects due to newer immunotherapy agents is growing, an up-to-date understanding of their mechanisms and potential toxicities is critical.","Chhabra, Neeraj; Kennedy, Joseph",J Med Toxicol,18,1

The effect of rapid nucleic acid testing (RPCR) in comparison to standard multiplex PCR (MPCR) diagnosis in treatment decisions is unclear. This study aimed to determine whether RPCR influenza testing in comparison to standard MPCR testing was associated with differences in antibiotic and antiviral (oseltamivir) utilisation and hospital length of stay in emergency department and inpatient hospital settings. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of positive influenza RPCR and MPCR patients was performed utilising data from the 2017 influenza season. Medical records of correlating patient presentations were reviewed for data collection. An analysis of RPCR versus MPCR patient outcomes was performed examining test turnaround time, antibiotic initiation, oseltamivir initiation and hospital length of stay for both emergency department and inpatient hospital stay. Subgroup analysis was performed to assess oseltamivir use in high risk populations for influenza complications. Statistical significance was assessed using Mann-Whitney test for numerical data and Chi-squared test for categorical data. Odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals were calculated where appropriate. RESULTS: Overall, 122 RPCR and 362 MPCR positive influenza patients were included in this study. Commencement of antibiotics was less frequent in the RPCR than MPCR cohorts (51% vs 67%; p < 0.01, OR 0.52; 95% CI 0.34–0.79). People at high risk of complications from influenza who were tested with the RPCR were more likely to be treated with oseltamivir compared to those tested with the MPCR (76% vs 63%; p = 0.03, OR 1.81; 95% CI 1.07–3.08). Hospital length of stay was not impacted when either test was used in the emergency department and inpatient settings. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest utilisation of RPCR testing in influenza management can improve antibiotic stewardship through reduction in antibiotic use and improvement in oseltamivir initiation in those at higher risk of complications. Further research is required to determine other factors that may have influenced hospital length of stay and a cost-benefit analysis should be undertaken to determine the financial impact of the RPCR test.","Au Yeung, Victor; Thapa, Kiran; Rawlinson, William; Georgiou, Andrew; Post, Jeffrey J.; Overton, Kristen",BMC Infect Dis,18,17

However, excessive and uncontrolled inflammation is implicated in a variety of devastating chronic diseases including atherosclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Improved understanding of inflammatory response has unveiled a rich assortment of anti-inflammatory therapeutics for the treatment and management of relevant chronic diseases. Notwithstanding these successes, clinical outcomes are variable among patients and serious adverse effects are often observed. Moreover, there exist some limitations for clinical anti-inflammatory therapeutics such as aqueous insolubility, low bioavailability, off-target effects, and poor accessibility to subcellular compartments. To address these challenges, the rational design of inflammation-specific drug delivery systems (DDSs) holds significant promise. Moreover, as compared to normal tissues, inflamed tissue-associated pathological milieu (e.g., oxidative stress, acidic pH, and overexpressed enzymes) provides vital biochemical stimuli for triggered delivery of anti-inflammatory agents in a spatiotemporally controlled manner. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the development of anti-inflammatory DDSs with built-in pathological inflammation-specific responsiveness for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases.

The “ideal” alveolar PCO(2), in equilibrium with pulmonary capillary PCO(2), is a central concept in the physiological dead space measurement. As it cannot be measured, it is surrogated by arterial PCO(2) which, unfortunately, may be far higher than ideal alveolar PCO(2), when the right-to-left venous admixture is present. The “ideal” alveolar PCO(2) equals the end-tidal PCO(2) (P(ET)CO(2)) only in absence of alveolar dead space. Therefore, in the perfect gas exchanger (alveolar dead space = 0, venous admixture = 0), the P(ET)CO(2)/PaCO(2) is 1, as P(ET)CO(2), P(A)CO(2) and PaCO(2) are equal. Our aim is to investigate if and at which extent the P(ET)CO(2)/PaCO(2), a comprehensive meter of the “gas exchanger” performance, is related to the anatomo physiological characteristics in ARDS. RESULTS: We retrospectively studied 200 patients with ARDS. The source was a database in which we collected since 2003 all the patients enrolled in different CT scan studies. The P(ET)CO(2)/PaCO(2), measured at 5 cmH(2)O airway pressure, significantly decreased from mild to mild–moderate moderate–severe and severe ARDS. The overall populations was divided into four groups (~ 50 patients each) according to the quartiles of the P(ET)CO(2)/PaCO(2) (lowest ratio, the worst = group 1, highest ratio, the best = group 4). The progressive increase P(ET)CO(2)/PaCO(2) from quartile 1 to 4 (i.e., the progressive approach to the “perfect” gas exchanger value of 1.0) was associated with a significant decrease of non-aerated tissue, inohomogeneity index and increase of well-aerated tissue. The respiratory system elastance significantly improved from quartile 1 to 4, as well as the PaO(2)/FiO(2) and PaCO(2). The improvement of P(ET)CO(2)/PaCO(2) was also associated with a significant decrease of physiological dead space and venous admixture. When PEEP was increased from 5 to 15 cmH(2)O, the greatest improvement of non-aerated tissue, PaO(2) and venous admixture were observed in quartile 1 of P(ET)CO(2)/PaCO(2) and the worst deterioration of dead space in quartile 4. CONCLUSION: The ratio P(ET)CO(2)/PaCO(2) is highly correlated with CT scan, physiological and clinical variables. It appears as an excellent measure of the overall “gas exchanger” status.","Bonifazi, Matteo; Romitti, Federica; Busana, Mattia; Palumbo, Maria Michela; Steinberg, Irene; Gattarello, Simone; Palermo, Paola; Saager, Leif; Meissner, Konrad; Quintel, Michael; Chiumello, Davide; Gattinoni, Luciano",Intensive Care Med Exp,18,22

OBJECTIVE: We reviewed epidemiologic studies that assessed the risk of mortality, hospital admissions, and symptoms/dysfunction associated with exposure to Asian dust. METHODS: We performed a systematic search of PubMed and Web of Science to identify studies that reported the association between Asian dust exposure and human health outcomes. We conducted separate meta-analyses using a random-effects model for mortality and hospital admissions for a specific health outcome and assessed pooled estimates for each lag when at least three studies were available for a specific lag. RESULTS: We identified 89 studies that met our inclusion criteria for the systematic review, and 21 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled estimates (percentage changes) of mortality from circulatory and respiratory causes for Asian dust days vs. non-Asian dust days were 2.33% [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.76, 3.93] increase at lag 0 and 3.99% (95% CI: 0.08, 8.06) increase at lag 3, respectively.

Web-based diaries are a useful activity for psychoeducation because of their therapeutic benefits, ability to capture naturalistic data relevant to well-being, and appropriateness for text analysis methods. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine how university students use electronic diaries within a psychoeducation program designed to enhance mental well-being. METHODS: The Science of Happiness course was administered to 154 undergraduate students in a university setting (the United Kingdom). Diaries were collected from the students for 9 weeks. Baseline well-being data were collected using the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (SWEMWBS). The percentage of negative and positive emotion words used in diaries (emotional tone) and use of words from five life domains (social, work, money, health, and leisure) were calculated using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count 2015 software. Random effects (generalized least squares) regression models were estimated to examine whether time, diary characteristics, demographics, and baseline well-being predict the emotional tone of diaries. RESULTS: A total of 149 students participated in the diary study, producing 1124 individual diary entries. Compliance with the diary task peaked in week 1 (n=1041, 92.62%) and was at its lowest in week 3 (n=807, 71.81%). Compared with week 1, diaries were significantly more positive in their emotional tone during week 5 (mean difference 23.90, 95% CI 16.89-30.90) and week 6 (mean difference 26.62, 95% CI 19.35-33.88) when students were tasked with writing about gratitude and their strengths. Across weeks, moderate and high baseline SWEMWBS scores were associated with a higher percentage of positive emotion words used in diaries (increases compared with students scoring low in SWEMWBS were 5.03, 95% CI 0.08-9.98 and 7.48, 95% CI 1.84-13.12, respectively). At week 1, the diaries of students with the highest levels of baseline well-being (82.92, 95% CI 73.08-92.76) were more emotionally positive on average than the diaries of students with the lowest levels of baseline well-being (59.38, 95% CI 51.02-67.73). Diaries largely focused on the use of social words. The emotional tone of diary entries was positively related to the use of leisure (3.56, 95% CI 2.28-4.85) and social words (0.74, 95% CI 0.21-1.27), and inversely related to the use of health words (−1.96, 95% CI −3.70 to −0.22).

Efforts to improve the conduct of delirium RCTs are underway, but none address issues related to statistical analysis. The purpose of this review is to evaluate heterogeneity in the design and analysis of delirium outcomes and advance methodological recommendations for delirium RCTs in the ICU. METHODS: Relevant databases, including PubMed and Embase, were searched with no restrictions on language or publication date; the search was conducted on July 8, 2019. RCTs conducted on adult ICU patients with delirium as the primary outcome were included where trial results were available. Data on frequency and duration of delirium assessments, delirium outcome definitions, and statistical methods were independently extracted in duplicate. The review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020141204). RESULTS: Among 65 eligible RCTs, 44 (68%) targeted the prevention of delirium. The duration of follow-up varied, with 31 (48%) RCTs having 7 days of follow-up, and only 24 (37%) conducting delirium assessments after ICU discharge. The incidence of delirium was the most common outcome (50 RCTs, 77%) for which 8 unique statistical methods were applied. The most common method, applied to 51 of 56 (91%) delirium incidence outcomes, was the two-sample test comparing the proportion of patients who ever experienced delirium. In the presence of censoring of patients at ICU discharge or death, this test may be misleading. The impact of censoring was also not considered in most analyses of the duration of delirium, as evaluated in 24 RCTs, with 21 (88%) delirium duration outcomes analyzed using a non-parametric test or two-sample t test. Composite outcomes (e.g., rank-based delirium- and coma-free days), used in 11 (17%) RCTs, seldom explicitly defined how ICU discharge, and death were incorporated into the definition and were analyzed using non-parametric tests (11 of 13 (85%) composite outcomes). CONCLUSIONS: To improve delirium RCTs, outcomes should be explicitly defined. To account for censoring due to ICU discharge or death, survival analysis methods should be considered for delirium incidence and duration outcomes; non-parametric tests are recommended for rank-based delirium composite outcomes.

A total of 39 peer-reviewed articles were selected from the literature published in the last 20 years (2000–2020) comparing PFA antioxidant effects with synthetic antioxidant vitamins (mainly vitamin E) in poultry nutrition. The PFA can be used as an effective nutritional strategy to face poultry’s oxidative stress with positive impact also on their productivity and efficiency. They can partially or completely replace antioxidant synthetic vitamins (the latter administered at doses between 150 and 500 mg/kg) in animal diets, sometimes affecting important physiological functions or expressing synergistic effect with the synthetic antioxidants. It is crucial to take into consideration the issues related to the absorption and the metabolism of these additives and their interaction with gut microbiota.

This study aimed to compare the use of the Smart Class teaching module with traditional teaching on the topic of psychosocial dysfunction during the training of undergraduate occupational therapy (OT) students in China. MATERIAL/METHODS: We recruited Grade 2017 OT students as the Smart Class teaching module group and Grade 2016 OT students as the Traditional Class teaching module group to participate in the study. The objective evaluation (assignment score, practical exam score, written exam score, and final score) and subjective evaluation (data from student questionnaires and information from interviews with the lead teacher and assistant teachers) were performed in both groups. RESULTS: No significant difference was found in the final scores (P=0.874) and students’ questionnaire results between the 2 groups. However, data from the student questionnaires and teacher interviews indicated a preference for combining the Smart Class teaching module and the Traditional Class teaching module. CONCLUSIONS: The advantage of the Smart Class teaching module is that it can effectively integrate excellent teaching resources across geographical restrictions and it is conducive to promoting independent learning for students and all-around supervision for teaching. The Smart Class teaching module was comparable to traditional teaching methods for the training of undergraduate OT students in China, but was preferred by the students.","Lin, Qiang; Qiu, Yaxian; Zhang, Yanni; Zheng, Yuxing; Zhang, Lingzi; Liang, Junjie; Anniwaer, Yilifate; Liao, Yujun; Jiang, Yueyi; Lang, Shijuan; Zhuang, Wanqi; Luo, Siyi; Zheng, Meifeng; Yan, QingHua; Chen, Ke; Chen, Qiuxia; Ou, Haining",Med Sci Monit,18,17

Using data from multiple sources, we generate high-resolution maps of ITN access, use, and nets-per-capita annually from 2000 to 2020 across the 40 highest-burden African countries. Our findings support several existing hypotheses: that use is high among those with access, that nets are discarded more quickly than official policy presumes, and that effectively distributing nets grows more difficult as coverage increases. The primary driving factors behind these findings are most likely strong cultural and social messaging around the importance of net use, low physical net durability, and a mixture of inherent commodity distribution challenges and less-than-optimal net allocation policies, respectively. These results can inform both policy decisions and downstream malaria analyses.","Bertozzi-Villa, Amelia; Bever, Caitlin A.; Koenker, Hannah; Weiss, Daniel J.; Vargas-Ruiz, Camilo; Nandi, Anita K.; Gibson, Harry S.; Harris, Joseph; Battle, Katherine E.; Rumisha, Susan F.; Keddie, Suzanne; Amratia, Punam; Arambepola, Rohan; Cameron, Ewan; Chestnutt, Elisabeth G.; Collins, Emma L.; Millar, Justin; Mishra, Swapnil; Rozier, Jennifer; Symons, Tasmin; Twohig, Katherine A.; Hollingsworth, T.

The main aim of the study was to establish a latent structure of the Social Media Fatigue Scale (SMFS) and to identify whether the Polish version is congruent with the Chinese version. The second aim was to examine whether the factor structure fits the data and yields a comparable goodness-of-fit index. The third aim was to consider the convergent validity of the SMFS and to verify whether tiredness and Internet addiction correlate positively. METHODS: The research was conducted on a group of 331 (1st Study) and 379 (2nd Study) adolescents and young adults. It was performed using the SMFS and Internet Addiction Test (IAT). RESULTS: The outcomes suggest that the three-factor structure is the optimal and reliable solution that corresponds to the original SMFS. CFA provided a good fit. All the dimensions of the SMFS correlated positively with Internet addiction. CONCLUSION: The Polish version of the SMFS presented satisfactory psychometric properties, showing many similarities with the original Chinese version of the SMFS. The findings confirm that excessive use of social media may lead to discomfort and negative emotions related to feeling overwhelmed by information, social interaction overload, and personal/others’ expectations.","Świątek, Agata H; Szcześniak, Małgorzata; Zhang, Shiyi; Borkowska, Hanna",Psychol Res Behav Manag,18,8

METHODS: Randomised controlled trials reporting intervention effects on physical activity in heart failure were combined in a meta-analysis using a random-effect model. Exploratory meta-analysis was performed by specifying the general approach (eg, cardiac rehabilitation), strategies used (eg, action planning), setting (eg, centre based), mode of delivery (eg, face to face or online), facilitator (eg, nurse), contact time and behavioural change theory use as predictors in the random-effect model. RESULTS: Interventions (n=21) had a significant overall effect (SMD=0.54, 95% CI (0.13 to 0.95), p<0.0005). Combining an exercise programme with behavioural change intervention was found efficacious (SMD=1.26, 95% CI (0.26 to 2.26), p<0.05). Centre-based (SMD=0.98, 95% CI (0.35 to 1.62), and group-based (SMD=0.89, 95% CI (0.29 to 1.50),) delivery by a physiotherapist (SMD=0.84, 95% CI (0.03 to 1.65),) were significantly associated with efficacy. The following strategies were identified efficacious: prompts/cues (SMD=3.29, 95% CI (1.97 to 4.62)), credible source (standardised mean difference, SMD=2.08, 95% CI (0.95;3.22)), adding objects to the environment (SMD=1.47, 95% CI (0.41 to 2.53)), generalisation of the target behaviour SMD=1.32, 95% CI (0.22 to 2.41)), monitoring of behaviour by others without feedback (SMD=1.02, 95% CI (0.05 to 1.98)), self-monitoring of outcome(s) of behaviour (SMD=0.79, 95% CI (0.06 to 1.52), graded tasks (SMD=0.73, 95% CI (0.22 to 1.24)), behavioural practice/rehearsal (SMD=0.72, 95% CI (0.26 to 1.18)), action planning (SMD=0.62, 95% CI (0.03 to 1.21)) and goal setting (behaviour) (SMD=0.56, 95% CI (0.03 to 1.08)). CONCLUSION: The meta-analysis suggests intervention characteristics that may be suitable for promoting physical activity in heart failure. There is moderate evidence in support of an exercise programme combined with a behavioural change intervention delivered by a physiotherapist in a group-based and centre-based settings.

Treatment aiming to cure chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is believed to require the induction of strong cellular immune responses, such as by therapeutic vaccination. METHODS: We designed a therapeutic HBV vaccine candidate (YF17D/HBc-C) using yellow fever vaccine YF17D as a live-attenuated vector to express HBV core antigen (HBc). Its ability to induce potent cellular immune responses was assessed in a mouse model that supports flavivirus replication. RESULTS: Following a HBc protein prime, a booster of YF17D/HBc-C was found to induce vigorous cytotoxic T cell responses. In a direct head-to-head comparison, these HBc-specific responses exceeded those elicited by adenovirus-vectored HBc. Target-specific T cells were not only more abundant, but also showed a higher degree of polyfunctionality, with HBc-specific CD8(+) T cells producing interferon γ and tumour necrosis factor α in addition to granzyme B. This immune phenotype translated into a superior cytotoxic effector activity toward HBc-positive cells in YF17D/HBc-C vaccinated animals in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: The results presented here show the potential of YF17D/HBc-C as a vaccine candidate to treat CHB, and warrant follow-up studies in preclinical animal models of HBV persistence in which other candidate vaccines have been unable to achieve a sustained virologic response. LAY SUMMARY: Resolution of CHB requires the induction of strong cellular immune responses. We used the yellow fever vaccine as a vector for HBV antigens and show that it is capable of inducing high levels of HBV-specific T cells that produce multiple cytokines simultaneously and are cytotoxic in vivo.","Boudewijns, Robbert; Ma, Ji; Neyts, Johan; Dallmeier, Kai",JHEP Rep,18,1

METHODS: Mice (n=295) were first intratracheally instilled with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce ALI and then received an intraperitoneal (ip) injection of either normal saline (NS), ambroxol (30 or 90 mg/kg per day) or dexamethasone (2.5 or 5 mg/kg per day) for 7 days. Metabolism (n=10, each), lung morphology (n=5, each) and wet-to-dry lung weight ratio (n=10, each) were studied. The levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and transforming growth factor (TGF-β1) and the protein concentration (n=5 or 7, each) in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were measured. RESULTS: Mice with LPS-induced ALI that were treated with ambroxol at a dosage of 90 mg/kg per day significantly gained weight compared to the control and dexamethasone-treated groups. Ambroxol and dexamethasone significantly reduced the lung hemorrhage, edema, exudation, neutrophil infiltration and total lung injury histology score at 24 and 48 h. In addition, ambroxol and dexamethasone significantly attenuated the lung wet-to-dry weight ratio at 24 and 48 h (p<0.05). Compared to the control group, TNF-α, IL-6 and TGF-β1 levels in the BAL in both ambroxol- and dexamethasone-treated groups were significantly reduced at 24 and 48 h. The protein in BAL, an index of vascular permeability, was also significantly decreased in the ambroxol- and dexamethasone-treated groups (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Ambroxol inhibited proinflammatory cytokines, reduced lung inflammation and accelerated recovery from LPS-induced ALI.","Su, Xiao; Wang, Ling; Song, Yuanlin; Bai, Chunxue",Intensive Care Med,18,1

Unfortunately, current psychological treatments offer mixed, usually small improvements in these symptoms. The present trial tested for the first time the effects of group metacognitive therapy (MCT; 6 sessions) on anxiety and depressive symptoms when delivered alongside cardiac rehabilitation (CR). METHODS: A total of 332 CR patients recruited from 5 National Health Service Trusts across the North-West of England were randomly allocated to MCT+CR (n=163, 49.1%) or usual CR alone (n=169, 50.9%). Randomization was 1:1 via minimization balancing arms on sex and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale scores within hospital site. The primary outcome was Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale total after treatment (4-month follow-up). Secondary outcomes were individual Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scales, traumatic stress symptoms, and psychological mechanisms including metacognitive beliefs and repetitive negative thinking. Analysis was intention to treat. RESULTS: The adjusted group difference on the primary outcome, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale total score at 4 months, significantly favored the MCT+CR arm (–3.24 [95% CI, –4.67 to –1.81], P<0.001; standardized effect size, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.291 to 0.750]). The significant difference was maintained at 12 months (–2.19 [95% CI, –3.72 to –0.66], P=0.005; standardized effect size, 0.33 [95% CI, 0.101 to 0.568]). The intervention improved outcomes significantly for both depression and anxiety symptoms when assessed separately compared with usual care. Sensitivity analysis using multiple imputation of missing values supported these findings. Most secondary outcomes favored MCT+CR, with medium to high effect sizes for psychological mechanisms of metacognitive beliefs and repetitive negative thinking. No adverse treatment-related events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Group MCT+CR significantly improved depression and anxiety compared with usual care and led to greater reductions in unhelpful metacognitions and repetitive negative thinking. Most gains remained significant at 12 months. Study strengths include a large sample, a theory-based intervention, use of longer-term follow-up, broad inclusion criteria, and involvement of a trials unit. Limitations include no control for additional contact as part of MCT to estimate nonspecific effects, and the trial was not intended to assess cardiac outcomes. Nonetheless, results demonstrated that addition of the MCT intervention had broad and significant beneficial effects on mental health symptoms.

Headache and visual disturbances are frequent complaints of IIH patients, but little is known about other symptoms. In this study, we evaluated the patients’ perspective on the burden of IIH. METHODS: For this cross-sectional study, we developed an online survey for patients with IIH containing standardized evaluations of headache (HIT-6), sleep (PROMIS Sleep Disturbance Scale) and depression (MDI) in relation to BMI, lumbar puncture opening pressure (LP OP) and treatment. RESULTS: Between December 2019 and February 2020, 306 patients completed the survey. 285 (93 %) were female, mean age was 36.6 years (± 10.8), mean BMI 34.2 (± 7.3) and mean LP OP at diagnosis was 37.8 cmH(2)O (± 9.5). 219 (72 %) of the participants were obese (BMI ≥ 30); 251 (82 %) reported severe impacting headaches, 140 (46 %) were suffering from sleep disturbances and 169 (56 %) from depression. Higher MDI scores correlated with higher BMI and increased sleep disturbances. Patients with a normalized LP opening pressure reported less headaches, less sleep disturbances and less depression than those with a constantly elevated opening pressure. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to headaches and visual disturbances, sleep disturbances and depression are frequent symptoms in IIH and contribute to the patients’ burden. Structured questionnaires can help to identify IIH patients’ needs and can lead to personalized and better treatment.

The initiation of cachexia is also associated with decreased physical activity. While chronic muscle AMPK activation occurs during cachexia progression in Apc (Min) (/+) (MIN) mice, a preclinical cachexia model, the understanding of muscle AMPK’s role during cachexia initiation is incomplete. Therefore, we examined if voluntary wheel exercise could improve skeletal muscle AMPK signaling in pre‐cachectic MIN mice. Next, we examined muscle AMPK’s role in aberrant catabolic signaling in response to a 12‐h fast in mice initiating cachexia. Male C57BL/6 (B6: N = 26) and MIN (N = 29) mice were subjected to ad libitum feeding, 12‐h fast, or 4 wks. of wheel access and then a 12‐h fast during the initiation of cachexia. Male tamoxifen‐inducible skeletal muscle AMPKα (1) α (2) (KO) knockout mice crossed with Apc (Min) (/+) and floxed controls were examined (WT: N = 8, KO: N = 8, MIN: N = 10, MIN KO: N = 6). Male mice underwent a 12‐h fast and the gastrocnemius muscle was analyzed. MIN gastrocnemius mass was reduced compared to B6 mice. A 12‐h fast induced MIN muscle AMPK(T172), FOXO(S413), and ULK‐1(S555) phosphorylation compared to B6. Wheel running attenuated these inductions. A 12‐h fast induced MIN muscle MuRF‐1 protein expression compared to B6 and was suppressed by wheel running. Additionally, fasting induced muscle autophagy signaling and disrupted mitochondrial quality protein expression in the MIN, which was prevented in the MIN KO. We provide evidence that increased skeletal muscle AMPK sensitivity to a 12‐h fast is an adverse event in pre‐cachectic MIN mice, and exercise can improve this regulation.","Fix, Dennis K.; Counts, Brittany R.; Smuder, Ashley J.; Sarzynski, Mark A.; Koh, Ho‐Jin; Carson, James A.",Physiol Rep,18,1

Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the acute effects of 45 min of official competition (first half in matches) on physical performance variables in U-16 youth soccer players. (2) Methods: 20 male soccer players (age: 14.4 ± 0.5 years; height: 1.70 ± 0.05 cm; body mass: 65.1 ± 11.6 kg) were recruited to participate in this study. Data was collected from five official matches. Participants performed the assessments in two stages of each match: after the pre-match warm-up and after the first half. Tests included rate of perceived exertion (RPE), 30-m sprint and countermovement (CMJ). (3) Results: Statistically significant differences were found (p < 0.001) when the measurements prior to the game were compared with those recorded after half time across all variables. Effect sizes (ES) were very large for RPE (ES = 1.82), moderate for 30-m sprint times (ES = 0.64) and small for CMJ (ES = −0.25). (4) Conclusions: After 45 min of official competition, our results suggest that U-16 soccer players demonstrated a reduction in sprint and jump performance, in addition to a higher RPE.

Although there is no direct evidence supporting the direct involvement of nutrition in curing disease, for some diseases, good nutrition contributes to disease prevention and our overall well-being, including energy level, optimum internal function, and strength of the immune system. Lately, other major, but more silent players are reported to participate in the body’s response to ingested nutrients, as they are involved in different physiological and pathological processes. Furthermore, the genetic profile of an individual is highly critical in regulating these processes and their interactions. In particular, miR-155, a non-coding microRNA, is reported to be highly correlated with such nutritional processes. In fact, miR-155 is involved in the orchestration of various biological processes such as cellular signaling, immune regulation, metabolism, nutritional responses, inflammation, and carcinogenesis. Thus, this review aims to highlight those critical aspects of the influence of dietary components on gene expression, primarily on miR-155 and its role in modulating cancer-associated processes.","Zanoaga, Oana; Braicu, Cornelia; Chiroi, Paul; Andreea, Nutu; Hajjar, Nadim Al; Mărgărit, Simona; Korban, Schuyler S.; Berindan-Neagoe, Ioana",Nutrients,18,1

HCC targeting strategies were combined with the tumor cell cytotoxicity of oncolytic viruses (OVs) to develop a more efficient and selective therapeutic system. OVs were coated with a polygalactosyl-b-agmatyl diblock copolymer (Gal(32)-b-Agm(29)), with high affinity for the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) expressed on the liver cell surface, exploiting the electrostatic interaction of the positively charged agmatine block with the negatively charged adenoviral capsid surface. The polymer coating altered the viral particle diameter (from 192 to 287 nm) and zeta-potential (from –24.7 to 23.3 mV) while hiding the peculiar icosahedral symmetrical OV structure, as observed by TEM. Coated OVs showed high potential therapeutic value on the human hepatoma cell line HepG2 (cytotoxicity of 72.4% ± 4.96), expressing a high level of ASGPRs, while a lower effect was attained with ASPGR-negative A549 cell line (cytotoxicity of 54.4% ± 1.59). Conversely, naked OVs showed very similar effects in both tested cell lines. Gal(32)-b-Agm(29) OV coating enhanced the infectivity and immunogenic cell death program in HepG2 cells as compared to the naked OV. This strategy provides a rationale for future studies utilizing oncolytic viruses complexed with polymers toward effective treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.","Garofalo, Mariangela; Bellato, Federica; Magliocca, Salvatore; Malfanti, Alessio; Kuryk, Lukasz; Rinner, Beate; Negro, Samuele; Salmaso, Stefano; Caliceti, Paolo; Mastrotto, Francesca",Pharmaceutics,18,11

The increased incidence of injuries, some of them severe, in our emergency department in the catchment area of several sledding slopes prompted an analysis of this patient population with respect to frequency and severity of injuries. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Based on the hospital documentation system, a retrospective evaluation of all emergency department visits in the winters 2016–2019 was performed. The words “sled”, “sledge”, “bob”, “sledding”, “sleighing”, “sledging” were used as keywords, and the recorded data were analyzed with respect to outpatient treatment, inpatient treatment, inpatient treatment days, treatment days in the intensive care unit, number of necessary operations, injury patterns, and injury severity. RESULTS: A total of 175 injured patients were recorded over the 3‑year period. In 94 patients (54%) the injury was classified as mild, 70 patients (40%) required inpatient treatment with an average length of stay of 8 days, resulting in a total of 590 inpatient treatment days. Surgical treatment was given to 49 (28%) of the injured with a total of 66 operations, 81 patients suffered from severe injuries up to multiple trauma with an injury severity score (ISS) of 34. DISCUSSION: The study demonstrates that sledding has a significantly higher injury potential than generally assumed and that the resulting costs and consequences of accidents are relevant. Especially on the designated sledge slopes, an increase in safety standards could be achieved through appropriate measures and rules.","Kraus, Stephanie; Friederichs, Jan; von Rüden, Christian; Stuby, Fabian; Schneidmüller, Dorien; Beck, Markus",Unfallchirurg,18,1

Empirical evidence of the program’s association with the viability of the state’s rural hospitals is needed. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of the tax credit program with the financial health of participating rural hospitals. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This longitudinal cross-sectional study used hospital financial data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for 2015 to 2019. A difference-in-differences analytic approach was used to examine the association of the tax credit program with rural hospital financial health. Study participants included Georgia rural hospitals eligible to participate in the program. Comparison hospitals were selected from the southern states of Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee. EXPOSURES: Hospital participation in the Georgia Rural Hospital Tax Credit Program. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome of the study was financial health measured with total margin, days cash on hand, debt-asset ratio, and average age of plant as well as a Financial Strength Index (FSI), which combined the previous measures to assess overall financial strength. RESULTS: The analytical sample included a balanced panel of 136 hospitals, with 47 Georgia Rural Hospital Tax Credit Program participants (18 [38%] critical access hospitals; 5 [11%] system affiliated; mean [SD] bed count, 60 [47]; mean [SD] Medicare inpatient mix, 52% [16]) and 89 comparison hospitals (43 [48%] critical access hospitals; 24 [27%] system affiliated; mean [SD] bed count, 52 [41]; mean [SD] Medicare inpatient mix, 67% [18]). Two years after implementation, program participation was associated with a 23% increased probability of good or excellent financial health (b = 0.23; 95% CI, 0.10-0.37; P < .001) and a 6.7-point increase in total margin (b = 6.67; 95% CI, 3.61-9.73; P < .001).

Existing automated SPC trigger criteria are designed to identify patients at highest risk of in-hospital death. We sought to evaluate common mortality-based SPC triggers and determine whether these triggers reflect actual use of SPC consultation. We additionally aimed to characterize the population of patients who receive SPC without meeting mortality-based triggers. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all adult ICU admissions from 2012–2017 at an academic medical center with five subspecialty ICUs to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the five most common SPC triggers for predicting receipt of SPC. Among ICU admissions receiving SPC, we assessed differences in patients who met any SPC trigger compared to those who met none. RESULTS: Of 48,744 eligible admissions, 1,965 (4.03%) received SPC; 979 (49.82%) of consultations met at least 1 trigger. The sensitivity and specificity for any trigger predicting SPC was 49.82% and 79.61%, respectively. Patients who met no triggers but received SPC were younger (62.71 years vs 66.58 years, mean difference (MD) 3.87 years (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.44–5.30) p<0.001), had longer ICU length of stay (11.43 days vs 8.42 days, MD -3.01 days (95% CI -4.30 –-1.72) p<0.001), and had a lower rate of in-hospital death (48.68% vs 58.12%, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Mortality-based triggers for specialty palliative care poorly reflect actual use of SPC in the ICU. Reliance on such triggers may unintentionally overlook an important population of patients with clinician-identified palliative care needs.","Secunda, Katharine E.; Krolikowski, Kristyn A.; Savage, Madeline F.; Kruser, Jacqueline M.",PLoS One,18,12

STUDY DESIGN: Within two large academic and community hospitals, we retrospectively reviewed all infants meeting institutional criteria (< 37 weeks’ gestation and/or < 2.27 kg) for CSTS from 2014 to 2018. Multivariable logistic regression evaluated the association of patient characteristics with institutional CSTS guideline adherence. RESULTS: 4374 eligible infants were born PTM (50.9%), T-LBW (6.5%), or P-LBW (42.6%). Adherence rates were 92.7% in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and 95.2% in the well-baby nursery with initial CSTS failure rates of 6.1% and 9.9%, respectively. Adherence was lowest among T-LBW (80.7%) compared to PTM (95.1%) or P-LBW (92.2%) infants in the NICU (p < 0.001) and well-baby nursery (81.6%, 96.7% and 97.1%, respectively, p < 0.001). In bivariate analyses, gestational age, birth weight, insurance, race, hospital type, discharge year, and preferred language were associated with adherence. In fully-adjusted models, adherence was positively associated with lower gestational age, higher birth weight, non-Medicaid insurance, and later discharge year (NICU) and lower gestational age and later discharge year (well-baby nursery). CONCLUSIONS: Adherence was lower for T-LBW than PTM or P-LBW infants, despite similar CSTS failure rates. Disparities in adherence among Medicaid-insured patients in the NICU warrant further study. Future studies are needed to clarify the benefit of CSTS and increase adherence in high-risk populations.

Malnutrition is associated with lower levels of education that decrease economic productivity and leads to poverty. The global burden of malnutrition continues to be unacceptably high amid social and economic growth, including in Bangladesh. Therefore, identifying the factors associated with childhood malnutrition and poverty is necessary to stop the vicious cycle of malnutrition leaded poverty. METHODS: The study utilized the 2017–18 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS), accumulating 7,738 mother-child pairs. Associations between potential risk factors and nutritional status were determined using chi-square tests, and multivariate logistic regression models were utilized on significant risk factors to measure their odds ratio (OR) with their 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: The prevalence of moderate and severe wasting was 7.0% and 1.8%, respectively, whereas the prevalence of moderate and severe stunting was 19.2% and 8.0%, while 16.4% and 3.6% of children were moderately and severely underweight. Children from the poorest and poor households were suffering from at least one form of malnutrition. Adjusted ORs were estimated by controlling socio-economic and demographic risk factors, such as poor maternal body mass index, parents’ lower education level, use of unhygienic toilet, child age in months, and recent experience of diarrhea and fever. The pattern was almost similar for each malnutrition status (i.e., stunting, underweight, and wasting) in the poorest and poor households. CONCLUSION: Bangladesh achieved the Millennium Development Goals, focusing primarily on health-related indicators and working to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. Even considering this success, the prevalence of malnutrition and poverty in same household remains relatively high compared to other developing countries. Therefore, the study recommends the implementation of nationwide systematic measures to prevent poverty and malnutrition.","Rahman, Md. Ashfikur; Halder, Henry Ratul; Rahman, Md.

Materials and Methods: We performed an observational study with 4- and 5-year dental medical students at the UMF “Carol Davila” in Bucharest from October 2020–May 2021, using a questionnaire containing 20 items on domestic violence (DV). The questionnaire was uploaded online on the e-learning platform where the students have access. To collect the data, we used Microsoft Excel 365, and the statistical analysis was performed using Jamovi. Results: Of the 600 students enrolled, 415 answered the questionnaire, the answering rate being 69.16%. A total of 215 (53.1%) personally knew victims of DV, 4 (1.0%) considered that violence within a couple is necessary for certain situations, 401 (99.0%) considered that domestic violence is a fundamental problem in today’s society, and 170 (41.5%) felt that in domestic violence situations, the blame lies solely with the partner who resorts to physical violence. Regarding the role of the physician, 220 (56%) considered that the physician should breach confidentiality and report cases when patients state they are a victim of DV, 337 (88.2%) thought that free medical treatment should be provided for DV victims who have a dire financial situation, and 212 (56.7%) considered that victims of DV are non-compliant patients. Conclusions: Domestic violence is a phenomenon well-known to stomatology students, which creates the premise of an excellent physician–patient relationship with them, aiding in proper management of ethical issues such as a potential need to breach confidentiality or evaluate the potential conflicts between autonomy and beneficence.","Isailă, Oana-Maria; Hostiuc, Sorin; Curcă, George-Cristian",Medicina (Kaunas),18,8

The studied plasmonic probe is based on gold nanograting, realized on the top of a Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) chip. The PMMA substrate could be considered as a transparent substrate and, in such a way, it has been already used in previous work. Alternatively, here it is regarded as a slab waveguide. In particular, we have deposited upon the slab surface, covered with a nanograting, a synthetic receptor specific for bovine serum albumin (BSA), to test the proposed biosensing approach. Exploiting this different experimental configuration, we have determined how the orientation of the nanostripes forming the grating pattern, with respect to the direction of the input light (longitudinal or orthogonal), influences the biosensing performances. For example, the best limit of detection (LOD) in the BSA detection that has been obtained is equal to 23 pM. Specifically, the longitudinal configuration is characterized by two observable plasmonic phenomena, each sensitive to a different BSA concentration range, ranging from pM to µM.

The reliability, quality, and effectiveness of these apps are largely unknown, and the provided content seems questionable in terms of completeness, updating, and trustworthiness. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates available Italian pregnancy and postnatal care apps to highlight the main gaps to be overcome and the resulting future challenges to be met in this mobile health–related field. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, and basic information was collected for all identified apps. After deduplication and further selection based on the exclusion criteria, an in-depth analysis of each app was performed by two researchers independently. A 71-item six-domain questionnaire about the desirable features of apps was used to assess information, functionalities, and technical features, while the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS) was employed for app quality evaluation. RESULTS: From an initial sample of 684 apps, 22 were deeply analyzed. Most apps did not fulfill the expectations, as just one achieved 50% of all desirable aspects. Postnatal care and counselling for both the mother and child was the least accomplished domain. Moreover, the quality of app information was generally rated more negatively than the quality of their functionality and esthetic features. The lacking aspects were information about methods for postpartum family planning and birth spacing (1/22, 5%) and immunization (2/22, 9%). CONCLUSIONS: The identified gaps could serve as a basis for designing and implementing increasingly high-quality, targeted, and effective apps for pregnancy and postnatal health care, which provide comprehensive, reliable, and evidence-based information, as well as appropriate esthetic and functional characteristics, with relevant implications in terms of maternal and newborn health prevention and promotion.","Brunelli, Laura; De Vita, Chiara; Cenedese, Fabrizio; Cinello, Michela; Paris, Marta; Samogizio, Francesca; Starec, Anja; Bava, Michele; Dal Cin, Margherita; Zanchiello, Sara; Stampalija, Tamara",J Med Internet Res,18,8

A robustly effective treatment intervention is currently lacking. Virtual reality has beneficial effects on several non-ICU–related psychologic disorders. The aim of this study was to explore patient-related determinants of ICU-specific virtual reality, such as the timing of patients’ self-reported readiness to initiate virtual reality and the number of desired sessions and safety, and to explore the effects of ICU-specific virtual reality on mental health. DESIGN: A multicenter, randomized controlled feasibility study. SETTING: ICU at a university teaching hospital and a secondary care hospital in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. PATIENTS: Consecutive mechanically ventilated patients with sepsis or septic shock. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive ICU-specific virtual reality (ICU-specific virtual reality group) or exposure to a nature virtual reality environment (control virtual reality group). MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: Explorative outcomes were feasibility, in terms of patient-related determinants, and safety. The effects of ICU-specific virtual reality on the psychologic components of postintensive care syndrome and quality of life were additionally studied. Fifty patients (median age: 61 yr; 21 [42%] female) were included. Patients in the ICU-specific virtual reality group felt ready to initiate the virtual reality intervention 10 days (median, 95% range, 5–21 d) after ICU discharge, and one session (median, 95% range, 1–6) was desired. ICU-specific virtual reality patients experienced higher immersion, cybersickness scores were low, and no changes in vital signs were observed. They also reported reduced posttraumatic stress disorder and depression scores and better mental health from 2 days until 1 month after initial exposure (Short Form-12 Mental Component Scale: ICU-specific virtual reality, 57 [36–67] vs control virtual reality, 47 [26–63]; p < 0.01). Six months after exposure, this effect was still present for posttraumatic stress disorder and depression, but not for mental quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: ICU-specific virtual reality is a feasible and acceptable novel intervention that could be used during recovery from an episode of critical illness in the ICU. A future, adequately powered study should confirm whether virtual reality is able to improve mental health and quality of life.","Vlake, Johan H.; Van Bommel, Jasper; Wils, Evert-Jan; Korevaar, Tim I.

Artificial intelligence (AI) in general, and machine learning (ML) methods in particular, are already finding applications in tissue engineering and they can prove transformative resources for supporting designers in the field of regenerative medicine. In this study, the use of 3D convolutional neural networks (3D CNNs), trained using digital tomographies obtained from the CAD models, is validated as a powerful resource for predicting the mechanical properties of innovative scaffolds. The presented AI-aided or ML-aided design strategy is believed as an innovative approach in area of tissue engineering scaffolds, and of mechanical metamaterials in general.

The p26 movement protein from single-stranded, positive-sense Pea enation mosaic virus 2 (PEMV2) separates into a dense phase in nucleoli where p26 and related orthologues must interact with fibrillarin (Fib2) as a pre-requisite for systemic virus movement. Using in vitro assays, viral ribonucleoprotein complexes containing p26, Fib2, and PEMV2 genomic RNAs formed droplets that may provide the basis for self-assembly in planta. Mutating basic p26 residues (R/K-G) blocked droplet formation and partitioning into Fib2 droplets or the nucleolus and prevented systemic movement of a Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) vector in Nicotiana benthamiana. Mutating acidic residues (D/E-G) reduced droplet formation in vitro, increased nucleolar retention 6.5-fold, and prevented systemic movement of TMV, thus demonstrating that p26 requires electrostatic interactions for droplet formation and charged residues are critical for nucleolar trafficking and virus movement. p26 readily partitioned into stress granules (SGs), which are membraneless compartments that assemble by clustering of the RNA binding protein G3BP following stress.

Deletion of the NTF2 domain that is required for G3BP condensation restored PEMV2 RNA accumulation >4-fold, demonstrating that phase separation enhances G3BP antiviral activity. These results indicate that p26 partitions into membraneless compartments with either proviral (Fib2) or antiviral (G3BP) factors.","Brown, Shelby L.; Garrison, Dana J.; May, Jared P.",PLoS Pathog,18,1

Given its relationship to ventilation and perfusion, ΔCO(2) may provide prognostic information and guide clinical decisions. We hypothesized that higher ΔCO(2) values are associated with occurrence of a composite outcome of re-intubation, postoperative mechanical ventilation, or 30-day mortality in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery. METHODS: We conducted a historical cohort study of adult patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery with an arterial line at a single tertiary care medical centre. The composite outcome, identified from electronic health records, was re-intubation, postoperative mechanical ventilation, or 30-day mortality. Student’s t test and Chi-squared test were used for univariable analysis. Logistic regression was used for multivariable analysis of the relationship of ΔCO(2) with the composite outcome. RESULTS: A total of 19,425 patients were included in the final study population. Univariable analysis showed an association between higher mean (standard deviation [SD]) intraoperative ΔCO(2) values and the composite outcome (6.1 [5.3] vs 5.7 [4.5] mm Hg; P = 0.002). After adjusting for baseline subject characteristics, every 5-mm Hg increase in the ΔCO(2) was associated with a nearly 20% increased odds of the composite outcome (odds ratio, 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 1.12 to 1.28; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In this patient population, increased intraoperative ΔCO(2) was associated with an increased odds of the composite outcome of postoperative mechanical ventilation, re-intubation, or 30-day mortality that was independent of its relationship with pre-existing pulmonary disease. Future studies are needed to determine if ΔCO(2) can be used to guide patient management and improve patient outcomes.","Davis, Ryan; Jewell, Elizabeth; Engoren, Milo; Maile, Michael",Can J Anaesth,18,1

Efficient evaluation of its pollution status is a basis for further soil reclamation. Visible and near–infrared reflectance (Vis–NIR) spectroscopy has been diffusely used for retrieving heavy metals concentrations. However, the reliability and feasibility of calibrated models were still doubtful. The present study estimated zinc (Zn) concentrations via the random forest (RF) and partial least squares regression (PLSR) using ground in-situ Zn concentrations as well as soil spectral reflectance at an Opencast Coal Mine of Ordos, China in February 2020. The coefficient of determination (R(2)), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and the ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) were selected to assess the robustness of the methods in estimating Zn contents. Moreover, the characteristic bands were chosen by Pearson correlation analysis and Boruta Algorithm. Finally, the comparison between RF and PLSR combined with eight spectral reflectance transformation methods was conducted for four concentration groups to determine the optimal model. The results indicated that: (1) Zn contents represented a skewed distribution (coefficient of variation (CV) = 33%); (2) the spectral reflectance tended to decrease with the increase of Zn contents during 580–1850 nm based on Savitzky–Golay smoothing (SG); (3) the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) demonstrated higher effectiveness than other spectral reflectance transformation methods in enhancing spectral responses, the R(2) between Zn contents and the soil spectral reflectance achieved the highest (R(2) = 0.71) by using CWT; (4) the RF combined with CWT exhibited the best performance than other methods in the current study (R(2) = 0.97, RPD = 3.39, RMSE = 1.05 mg kg(−1), MAE = 0.79 mg kg(−1)). The current study supplied a scientific scheme and theoretical support for predicting heavy metals concentrations via the Vis–NIR spectral method in possible contaminated areas such as coal mines and metallic mineral deposit areas.","Guo, Bin; Zhang, Bo; Su, Yi; Zhang, Dingming; Wang, Yan; Bian, Yi; Suo, Liang; Guo, Xianan; Bai, Haorui",Sci Rep,18,1

METHODS: The outbreak investigation was launched on 11 March 2019 five days after the detection of B. cepacia in four different patients. We defined potential reservoirs and started environmental screening. We sampled the liquid solutions used in patient care activities. Pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was performed to determine the genetic relatedness of environmental and patient samples. RESULTS: Burkholderia cepacia was isolated in tracheal aspiration cultures of six patients. Three out of six patients developed healthcare-associated pneumoniae due to B. cepacia. Environmental cultures in the ICUs revealed B. cepacia growth in 2% chlorhexidine-gluconate mouthwash solution that been used in the colonized patients as well as in samples obtained from the unused products. PFGE revealed the patient and a specific batch of chlorhexidine mouthwash solution samples had a 96% similarity. CONCLUSION: Contamination of medical solutions used in critical patient care could cause outbreaks and should be detected early by infection control teams.

Healthcare professionals use tools such as FluView to help identify local pathogen circulation; however, these tools are limited to syndromic surveillance, and track a limited set of pathogens. Understanding respiratory disease dynamics requires 1) a large, pathogen rich data set 2) geographically dispersed data sources, and 3) fine temporal resolution. Here we utilize FilmArray® Trend, a research epidemiology system containing exported data from FilmArray® Respiratory Panel (RP) tests, to investigate geographic patterns of 20 common pathogens. METHODS: Over 6,000,000 individual pathogen assays from 19 clinical sites were exported to the Trend database from 2013 to present. Trend data were smoothed and normalized to produce the time series of pathogen incidence. A cross-correlation analysis was performed to compare sites to one another and determine offset of pathogen incidence. The results were plotted on a map of the US with visual indicators of correlation strength and directional movement as defined by cross-correlation lag values. RESULTS: The respiratory pathogens detected by the FilmArray RP test show a diverse set of spatial and temporal behaviors Most striking was the spread of the virus Coronavirus OC43, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), with RSV traveling from east coast sites to west coast sites across the US over 20 days. In contrast Parainfluenza virus 3 (PIV3) shows a small cross-correlation lag across all of the Trend sites during the regular summer season, indicating near simultaneous onset of detection nationwide. A localized cluster of PIV3 in the winter of 2016 was observed in the midwest and west, identifying the significance of localized regional trends. CONCLUSION: FilmArray Trend shows great promise in deciphering spatiotemporal dynamics of these common respiratory pathogens. This system can identify localized outbreaks and directional movement of pathogens over time. Future work with finer geographic distribution of contributing sites will aide in making conclusions regarding spatial dynamics of all 20 RP pathogens. Other pathogen transmission models may also be explored using this data set. DISCLOSURES: C. Cook, BioFire Diagnostics: Employee, Salary. A. Wallin, BioFire Defense: Employee, Salary. A.

On January 20, 2017, we identified a mumps outbreak in the Denver metropolitan area among a Marshallese community. We performed active surveillance to assess outbreak magnitude and guide implementation of control measures. METHODS: On January 22, local and state health departments initiated active case surveillance by using a church-based community roster. Each household was contacted by telephone ≥3 times to identify mumps cases, according to the 2012 CDC/Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists case definition, and risk factors (e.g., household size). Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination status was reviewed in the Colorado Immunization Information System (CIIS). Four church-based vaccination clinics were held to bring participants up-to-date for MMR vaccination. Targeted messaging about mumps, MMR vaccine, and vaccination clinics was distributed through social media, churches, and Marshallese-language radio. RESULTS: Of the 21 households on the church roster, 17 were successfully contacted, 13 of which (76%) provided data for 85 persons (median household size: 6 persons; range: 5–12). Through household interviews and laboratory reporting, we identified 47 mumps cases (17 confirmed; 30 probable). Median patient age was 20 years (range: 3 months–44 years), 24 (51%) were male, and 34 (72%) reported no or unknown prior mumps vaccination and had no MMR vaccination documented in CIIS. During vaccination clinics, 118 (80%) of 148 presenting Marshallese persons were eligible for and received MMR vaccine; of those vaccinated, median age was 21 years (range: 1–55 years) and 104 (88%) had no prior MMR vaccine documentation. CONCLUSION: Active surveillance, facilitated through culturally appropriate communication with church leaders, helped identify cases, disseminate materials, and promote MMR vaccination. Household interviews provided timely data to define outbreak magnitude and need for urgent MMR vaccination.

Only Legionella pneumophila and influenza virus, following the recent H1N1 influenza pandemic, are routinely suggested as responsible agents. However, CAP due to atypical bacteria may represent up to 44% of all CAP. Viral CAP is considered less severe than the usual bacterial ones, although 25% of them warrant hospitalization and 15% result in severe sepsis. Even though L. pneumophila is the most frequently atypical pathogen involved in severe cases, Mycoplasma pneumoniae may be responsible for multiorgan failure. To date, tools including detection of Legionella antigen in urine and Mycoplasma using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) allow rapid and accurate diagnosis. The treatment is based on macrolides and fluoroquinolones that can be associated in severe Legionnaire diseases. The presence of virus in CAP, either alone or in association with bacteria, has been demonstrated using molecular biology tests. These techniques also allowed the identification of several new viruses in CAP. However, the exact role of these detected viruses in CAP as well as the efficiency of antiviral therapy still represent major unsolved concerns.","Planquette, B.; Ferré, A.; Bédos, J. -P.",Reanimation,18,1

Field epidemiologists are the primary group of professionals responding to outbreaks and other health emergencies who provide evidence-based recommendations for decision makers. In outbreak investigations, their duties are to identify the disease etiology, risk factors or source of an outbreak, and to contain the spread of the disease. Field epidemiology training programs (FETP) recruit professionals with training in medical, veterinary medical and other related health sciences to deal with real-life outbreaks and health problems. Joint training in surveillance and outbreak investigation has led to improved surveillance and control of zoonotic diseases by young professionals from human health and animal health sectors. Field epidemiology training programs for veterinarians (FETPV) is a living branch of a mature FETP which could support the development of wildlife and ecosystem needs under a broad One Health canopy. FETP can be a practical means of actualizing the One Health approach based upon shared needs and mutual benefit. One such model for sustainable, joint capacity development in field epidemiology under a One Health approach has been initiated in Thailand and is being adopted in other Asian countries. The Field Epidemiology Training Network of FETP in Southeast Asia is a useful platform for further strengthening regional disease surveillance and improving response to both public and animal health problems of international concern.","Iamsirithaworn, Sopon; Chanachai, Karoon; Castellan, David",Confronting Emerging Zoonoses,18,1

The presumption has been that the securitisation of health will harness global political leadership and resources. This marriage of health issues to security logic has been met with a mix of applause, caution, and critique. In particular, there have been growing claims that the successful global health initiatives such as, the Global Fund for AIDS, TB, and Malaria (Global Fund) and the Global Alliance for Vaccine Immunization (GAVI) were achieved without asserting their necessity on security considerations. Thus, what difference does the association of security to health make for the success and longevity of global health initiatives? In this chapter, I answer this question through comparing a case where the security logic was deliberately deployed to frame the ‘health emergency’ (Framework Convention on Tobacco Control), against a case where human rights logic was used to advocate for its creation (the GAVI). I critically explore the conditions under which linking securitisation with an international health initiative captures and maintains political leadership and resources.","Davies, Sara E.",Global Insecurity,18,8

The creation of these leagues varies from the old (Japanese baseball) to the new (Chinese football). As the dynamics of political and economic power has shifted in East Asia in the last several decades, so has the popularity and importance of many of the sport leagues in the region. At the same time, as these leagues have grown, many of the top stars have begun to leave for more popular and competitive leagues in North America and Europe.

A bloody civil war in which an estimated 1 million people were killed ravaged the country from 1967 to 1970. Interethnic and intra-communal conflicts have also shaken the foundations of the nation since 1960 when colonial rule ended. Other violent conflicts that have plagued the country are religious conflicts in Kano, Bauchi, Kaduna, Kafanchan, Zaria, Jos, Maiduguri, and many other places. Blood-letting in the name of religion in these and other places in Nigeria has left thousands dead and wounded. Destruction of property in the course of religious violence in Nigeria has also wreaked economic calamity on the country. For instance, wanton destruction of property during the Maitatsene religious uprising in Kano from 1980 to 1985 resulted in the loss of lives and of millions of dollars. Clashes between members of the militant Shi’ite religious sect and the Nigerian army in 2016 led to the demolition of an entire neighborhood in Zaria city Nigeria’s latest bout of violence emanates from a deadly terrorist group, Boko Haram. Since 2009, it has killed over 20,000 people, displaced more than one million people, and contributed to the devastation of Nigeria’s northeast region. Initially, Boko Haram could not be contained by Nigerian security forces. It captured and held on to 14 local government districts and it constantly churned out online propaganda about its invisibility and its certainty that it would impose a radical Islamic government over the entire country. This chapter provides a critical analysis of Boko Haram’s propaganda. It examines the group’s core messages and the stylistic techniques used in delivering them. The chapter notes that Boko Haram deliberately used crude, unvanished imagery to reinforce the brutality of its actions in suicide bombings, drive-by shootings, and direct attacks against military barracks, markets, mosques, and churches. We contend that the effectiveness of Boko Haram’s propaganda began to decline as it suffered military defeats by Nigerian forces.","Ogbondah, Chris Wolumati; Agbese, Pita Ogaba",The Palgrave Handbook of Media and Communication Research in Africa,18,17

Other pandemics like the 1918 “Spanish Flu” may change into devastating event. Reducing the impact of these threats is of paramount importance for health authorities, and studies have shown that effective interventions can be taken to contain the epidemics, if early detection can be made. In this paper, we introduce Social Network Enabled Flu Trends (SNEFT), a continuous data collection framework which monitors flu related messages on online social networks such as Twitter and Facebook and track the emergence and spread of an influenza. We show that text mining significantly enhances the correlation between online social network(OSN) data and the Influenza like Illness (ILI) rates provided by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). For accurate prediction, we implemented an auto-regression with exogenous input (ARX) model which uses current OSN data and CDC ILI rates from previous weeks to predict current influenza statistics. Our results show that, while previous ILI data from the CDC offer a true (but delayed) assessment of a flu epidemic, OSN data provides a real-time assessment of the current epidemic condition and can be used to compensate for the lack of current ILI data. We observe that the OSN data is highly correlated with the ILI rates across different regions within USA and can be used to effectively improve the accuracy of our prediction. Therefore, OSN data can act as supplementary indicator to gauge influenza within a population and helps to discover flu trends ahead of CDC.","Achrekar, Harshavardhan; Gandhe, Avinash; Lazarus, Ross; Yu, Ssu-Hsin; Liu, Benyuan",Biomedical Engineering Systems and Technologies,18,33

However, there are a lot other viruses and bacteria that can be potential bioterrorism weapons. A system that can automatically suggest potential bioterrorism weapons will help laypeople to discover these suspicious viruses and bacteria. In this paper we apply instance-based learning & text mining approach to identify candidate viruses and bacteria as potential bio-terrorism weapons from biomedical literature. We first take text mining approach to identify topical terms of existed viruses (bacteria) from PubMed separately. Then, we apply a text mining method bridge these terms as instances with the remaining viruses (bacteria) and thus to discover how much these terms describe the remaining viruses (bacteria). In the end, we build an algorithm to rank all remaining viruses (bacteria). We suspect that the higher the ranking of the virus (bacterium) is, the more suspicious they will be potential bio-terrorism weapon. Our findings are intended as a guide to the virus and bacterium literature to support further studies that might then lead to appropriate defense and public health measures.","Hu, Xiaohua; Zhang, Xiaodan; Wu, Daniel; Zhou, Xiaohua; Rumm, Peter",Terrorism Informatics,18,1

The portable chest radiograph is the most commonly requested imaging examination in ICU, and, despite its limitations, it significantly contributes to the decision-making process. Multidetector CT (MDCT) is reserved for relatively complex and challenging clinical scenarios. Bedside ultrasound is emerging as a promising imaging modality as it does not subject the patients to risks and resources involved in the transportation of these patients to the CT facility. Ultrasound is an effective modality to triage patients and is being increasingly incorporated into the emergency and intensive care management algorithms.","Lohan, Rahul",Thoracic Imaging,18,1

Although indoor pollution of formaldehyde and benzene has been effectively alleviated in recent years in China, indoor pollution of toluene and xylenes is still serious. Besides, studies show that indoor pollution of particulate matter (PM), biological pollutants, and semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) might also be serious in China. The establishment and implementation of indoor air quality (IAQ)-related regulations and standards, the research on indoor air pollution and its control, and the development of indoor environmental monitoring and cleaning industry have played significant roles in preventing and controlling indoor air pollution in China. However, problems such as lack of mandatory standards for IAQ, lack of regulation and labeling of pollutant emissions from indoor decorating and refurbishing materials, lack of an effective performance evaluation system for air cleaning products, and lack of proper maintenance of air cleaners remain to be solved for further improvement of IAQ.

The infection is usually caused by viruses including rhinoviruses, influenza viruses, parainfluenza and respiratory syncytial viruses. Influenza is the only viral infection preventable by vaccination and occurs predominately during annual winter epidemics. Bacterial infection such as acute rhinopharyngitis is uncommon and usually presents with either persistent symptoms of an URTI lasting over a week or worsening course after initial improvement or acute onset with high fever and inflammatory changes confined to the pharynx. Fever is common in both bacterial and viral gastroenteritis. High fever is commonly present in many bacterial causes (e.g. Shigella, Salmonella, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli). Fever is often absent or low-grade in other diseases (e.g. enteropathogenic E. coli, cholera). Other febrile conditions cause diarrhoea and need to be differentiated. Fever in CNS infection is the most common presenting symptom in children beyond the neonatal age owing to the presence of inflammatory mediators, particularly IL-1 and TNF in the blood or within the CNS. In MCD, fever was the first symptom in children younger than 5 years and 94% developed fever at some point. Viral exanthems are common causes of febrile illness in children. More than 50 viral agents are known to cause a rash. Historically, exanthems were numbered in the order in which they were differentiated from other exanthems. Thus the first was measles; second, scarlet fever; third, rubella; forth, so-called Filatov-Dukes disease (no longer recognized as an entity); fifth, erythema infectiosum; and sixth, exanthema subitum. As more exanthems were described, numerical assignment became impractical.","El-Radhi, A. Sahib",Clinical Manual of Fever in Children,18,11

While surgical resection remains the mainstay of treatment for isolated recurrences, locoregional melanoma can often present as bulky, unresectable disease and can pose a significant therapeutic challenge. This chapter focuses on the natural history of local and regionally recurrent metastases and the multiple treatment modalities which exist for advanced locoregional melanoma, including regional perfusion procedures such as hyperthermic isolated limb perfusion and isolated limb infusion, intralesional therapies, and neo-adjuvant systemic therapy strategies for borderline resectable regional disease. Hyperthermic limb perfusion (HILP) and isolated limb infusion (ILI) are generally well-tolerated and have shown overall response rates between 44% and 90%. Intralesional therapies also appear to be well-tolerated as adverse events are usually limited to the site of injection and minor transient flu-like symptoms. Systemic targeted therapies have shown to have response rates up to 85% when used as neoadjuvant therapy in patients with borderline resectable disease. While combination immunotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting has also shown promising results, this data has not yet matured.","Perez, Matthew C.; Tanabe, Kenneth K.; Ariyan, Charlotte E.; Miura, John T.; Mutabdzic, Dorotea; Farma, Jeffrey M.; Zager, Jonathan S.",Cutaneous Melanoma,18,17

Since these models are based on direct term matching, their accuracy can suffer from a mismatch between vocabularies used in queries and entity descriptions. Although successful applications of word embeddings and knowledge graph entity embeddings to address the issues of vocabulary mismatch in ad-hoc document retrieval and knowledge graph noisiness and incompleteness, respectively, have been reported in recent literature, the utility of joint word and entity embeddings for entity search in knowledge graphs has been relatively unexplored. In this paper, we propose Knowledge graph Entity and Word Embedding for Retrieval (KEWER), a novel method to embed entities and words into the same low-dimensional vector space, which takes into account a knowledge graph’s local structure and structural components, such as entities, attributes, and categories, and is designed specifically for entity search. KEWER is based on random walks over the knowledge graph and can be considered as a hybrid of word and network embedding methods. Similar to word embedding methods, KEWER utilizes contextual co-occurrences as training data, however, it treats words and entities as different objects. Similar to network embedding methods, KEWER takes into account knowledge graph’s local structure, however, it also differentiates between structural components. Experiments on publicly available entity search benchmarks and state-of-the-art word and joint word and entity embedding methods indicate that a combination of KEWER and BM25F results in a consistent improvement in retrieval accuracy over BM25F alone.","Nikolaev, Fedor; Kotov, Alexander",Advances in Information Retrieval,18,8

In this paper, we introduce the basic models of networks used to describe the social contacts within a population. Then we study how to transfer the traditional epidemic models, based on the “homogeneous mixing” assumption, to the new framework. We will see that, moving from the classical to the network modelling approach, results become more complex and somehow unexpected, as the structure of the social network plays a fundamental role.","Piccardi, Carlo",,18,5

Adenosine acts via four adenosine receptors of which the A2a receptor is the predominant form in T cells. Adenosine levels are elevated in asthmatic lung, and adenosine can directly induce mast cell degranulation and bronchoconstriction in these patients. Instead, the role of anti‐inflammatory mechanisms of adenosine on T cells in asthma is unclear. Aim: To study the A2a receptor expression in peripheral blood CD4(+) T cells in asthmatic and healthy individuals using flow cytometric and quantitative real‐time PCR methods. Results: Unstimulated CD4(+) cells of asthmatic patients expressed significantly lower levels (P < 0.001) of A2a receptor in protein level (mean percentage of cells positive ± SEM: 76.8 ± 1.2, n = 6) compared to healthy individuals (90.4% ± 1.9, n = 4). Double staining for CD69 expression showed that stimulation of CD4(+) cells decreased A2a expression in both groups but indicated that the detected lower levels of A2a in unstimulated cells of asthmatics was not due to preactivation in these patients. Surprisingly, A2a mRNA expression in unstimulated CD4(+) cells was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in asthmatics (n = 28) compared to healthy controls (n = 7). The expression did not correlate with serum total IgE levels. Conclusions: Asthmatic individuals express less A2a adenosine receptor on their peripheral CD4(+) T cells. The higher mRNA levels instead may point to a negative feedback regulation in the receptor expression. The role of possibly decreased adenosine‐mediated anti‐inflammatory effects in asthma pathogenesis require further studies on this T‐cell mediated disease.","Holopainen, P.; Karagiannidis, C.; Rückert, B.; Hense, G.; Schmidt‐Weber, C.; Blaser, K.",Scand J Immunol,18,1

From a leisure perspective, urban outdoor enthusiasts are one group particularly impacted by the pandemic and the subsequent institutional response. Stay-at-home orders and physical distancing recommendations serve as potential inhibitors to outdoor recreation activities central to the lifestyles and wellbeing of outdoor enthusiasts. In urban areas, where these orders and recommendations are most restrictive, the potential impacts on recreation behavior are most consequential. This study provides an empirical analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on the recreational behaviors of outdoor enthusiasts across urban and rural communities. Results suggest that the frequency of outdoor recreation participation, distance travelled to participate in outdoor recreation and distance travelled beyond roads during outdoor recreation have declined significantly more among outdoor enthusiasts residing in urban areas than urban clusters or rural areas.","Rice, William L; Mateer, Timothy J; Reigner, Nathan; Newman, Peter; Lawhon, Ben; Taff, B Derrick",,18,11

Though verification of uninterpreted programs (with no axioms) is already undecidable, a recent work introduced a subclass of coherent uninterpreted programs, and showed that they admit decidable verification [26]. We undertake a systematic study of various natural axioms for relations and functions, and study the decidability of the coherent verification problem. Axioms include relations being reflexive, symmetric, transitive, or total order relations, functions restricted to being associative, idempotent or commutative, and combinations of such axioms as well. Our comprehensive results unearth a rich landscape that shows that though several axiom classes admit decidability for coherent programs, coherence is not a panacea as several others continue to be undecidable.","Mathur, Umang; Madhusudan, P.; Viswanathan, Mahesh",Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems,18,1

Recent studies indicate that information seeking behavior is not necessarily a measure of enhanced individual preparedness. A qualitative change from “blindly” following directions to practicing emergency planning and becoming your own disaster risk manager is required. For pandemics, the challenge is even more complicated due to their unique characteristics. Community based exercises (CBEx), a framework concept encompassing a variety of interactive activities, have recently started being utilized to develop resilience amongst citizens. Existing models of resilience can pinpoint to the required knowledge, skills and attitude. Research in the factors influencing behavioral change could offer new understanding of the interplay between cognitive and demographic drivers/factors of resilience. Such knowledge could be utilized for setting targeted objectives, developing appropriate activities and the corresponding training for the CBEx facilitators. Despite the importance of preparation, the current covid-19 crisis indicates that high levels of adaptive resilience can be displayed even in the absence of any risk communication effort beforehand by utilizing a pre-existing collective understanding of the system situation.","Katsikopoulos, Panagiotis V.",Mind Soc,18,33

While numerous studies estimate its effect on apolitical outcomes (e.g., dating and economic transactions), we know much less about its effects on political beliefs. We argue that those who exhibit high levels of affective polarization politicize ostensibly apolitical issues and actors. An experiment focused on responses to COVID-19 that relies on pre-pandemic, exogenous measures of affective polarization supports our expectations. Partisans who harbor high levels of animus towards the other party do not differentiate the “United States’” response to COVID-19 from that of the Trump administration. Less affectively polarized partisans, in contrast, do not politicize evaluations of the country’s response. Our results provide evidence of how affective polarization, apart from partisanship itself, shapes substantive beliefs. Affective polarization has political consequences and political beliefs stem, in part, from partisan animus.","Druckman, James N.; Klar, Samara; Krupnikov, Yanna; Levendusky, Matthew; Ryan, John Barry",,18,16

Little is known about the development of secondary bacterial or fungal infections in patients with COVID-19. Additionally, COVID patients receiving tocilizumab as treatment may be at higher risk for developing a secondary infection due to theoretical risk of immunosuppression. Table 1 [Image: see text] Table 2 [Image: see text] METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all COVID positive patients admitted to a 128 bed community hospital in Westchester County, NY from March 1 – May 31, 2020. The data was analyzed to determine incidence of secondary infections based on positive cultures in patients and further stratified based on receipt of tocilizumab. RESULTS: Out of 445 COVID positive patients reviewed, 69 (15.5%) had positive bacterial/fungal cultures. Average age of the patient population reviewed was 64 (range 1 – 106) and 60% of the patients were male. As of May 31, 2020, 114 of the patients had expired, 281 were discharged, 23 were transferred, and 27 were still admitted to the hospital. Of the 445 total patients, 42 received at least 1 dose of tocilizumab. Out of those patients, 6 patients (14.3%) had subsequent positive cultures. (Table 1) This was not statistically significant (p = 0.8185). Most common positive specimens were in urine (n=38), blood (n=33), and respiratory specimens (n=20). Most commonly found co-pathogens were Escherichia coli (n=22), Coagulase-negative staphylococci (n=11), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=9). Of the 69 patients with positive cultures, 27 received ICU level of care. (Table 2) CONCLUSION: A small retrospective study found that the incidence of bacterial or fungal co-infection for COVID positive patients was high but did not find receipt of tocilizumab was associated with secondary infections. This suggests areas for future study and further investigation as hospitals consider use of immunomodulatory therapies in the treatment of COVID-19.

RV failure is exacerbated by hypercapnic acidosis and overdistension induced by mechanical ventilation. Veno-venous extracorporeal CO(2) removal (ECCO(2)R) might allow ultraprotective ventilation with lower tidal volume (V(T)) and plateau pressure (P(plat)). This study investigated whether ECCO(2)R therapy could affect RV function. METHODS: This was a quasi-experimental prospective observational pilot study performed in a French medical ICU. Patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS with PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio between 80 and 150 mmHg were enrolled. An ultraprotective ventilation strategy was used with V(T) at 4 mL/kg of predicted body weight during the 24 h following the start of a low-flow ECCO(2)R device. RV function was assessed by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) during the study protocol. RESULTS: The efficacy of ECCO(2)R facilitated an ultraprotective strategy in all 18 patients included. We observed a significant improvement in RV systolic function parameters. Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) increased significantly under ultraprotective ventilation compared to baseline (from 22.8 to 25.4 mm; p < 0.05). Systolic excursion velocity (S’ wave) also increased after the 1-day protocol (from 13.8 m/s to 15.1 m/s; p < 0.05). A significant improvement in the aortic velocity time integral (VTIAo) under ultraprotective ventilation settings was observed (p = 0.05). There were no significant differences in the values of systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (sPAP) and RV preload. CONCLUSION: Low-flow ECCO(2)R facilitates an ultraprotective ventilation strategy thatwould improve RV function in moderate-to-severe ARDS patients. Improvement in RV contractility appears to be mainly due to a decrease in intrathoracic pressure allowed by ultraprotective ventilation, rather than a reduction of PaCO(2).","Goursaud, Suzanne; Valette, Xavier; Dupeyrat, Julien; Daubin, Cédric; du Cheyron, Damien",Ann Intensive Care,18,1

However, there are some issues during purification steps, sample preparation, suitability for quantification, and the instruments’ availability. Therefore, work on fluorescent sensors based on 8-aminoquinoline as tools to detect Zn(2+) ions in environmental and biological applications has been popular. Introducing various carboxamide groups into an 8-aminoquinoline molecule to create 8-amidoquinoline derivatives to improve water solubility and cell membrane permeability is also a recent trend. This review aims to present a general overview of the fluorophore 8-aminoquinoline and its derivatives as Zn(2+) receptors for zinc sensor probes. Various fluorescent chemosensor designs based on 8-amidoquinoline and their effectiveness and potential as a recognition probe for zinc analysis were discussed. Based on this review, it can be concluded that derivatives of 8-amidoquinoline have vast potential as functional receptors for zinc ions primarily because of their fast reactivity, good selectivity, and bio-compatibility, especially for biological applications. To better understand the Zn(2+) ion fluorophores’ function, diversity of the coordination complex and geometries need further studies. This review provides information in elucidating, designing, and exploring new 8-amidoquinoline derivatives for future studies for the improvement of chemosensors that are selective and sensitive to Zn(2+).","Mohamad, Nur Syamimi; Zakaria, Nur Hanis; Daud, Nurulhaidah; Tan, Ling Ling; Ta, Goh Choo; Heng, Lee Yook; Hassan, Nurul Izzaty",Sensors (Basel),18,1

This paper presents an optimization strategy for the allocation of COVID-19 vaccines, when they are available, through different fairness schemes (social welfare, Nash, Rawlsian justice, and social welfare II scheme). The applicability of the proposed model is illustrated using the case study of Mexico, including the states of the country as stakeholders. We involve several parameters to guide the allocation, such as the size, risk profiles, and fraction of vulnerable groups in the population. Furthermore, different scenarios of the availability of potential COVID-19 vaccines were evaluated. The social welfare approach is the most commonly used scheme for the allocation of resources. However, we demonstrate that this scheme yields non-unique or multiple solutions (through the social welfare II approach). These social welfare approaches provide inequalities in the allocations that become critical when resources are scarce. Specifically, the social welfare scheme favors large stakeholders (greater population) in all scenarios. We also observe how the complexity of the allocation increases with the higher availability of vaccines. Hence, it is relevant to consider allocation schemes to identify fair solutions.","Munguía-López, Aurora del Carmen; Ponce-Ortega, José María",Process Integr Optim Sustain,18,1

Immunization is an effective way to prevent many diseases, saving two to three million lives per year. The Nepal National Government recommends vaccinations for all children for 11 diseases by 15 months of age. However, only 78% of children between 1-2 years of age have received all recommended vaccines and only 43% receive them at the age-appropriate times for which they are scheduled. Objectives: This protocol describes the development of an intervention – called “Rejoice Architecture” – that is informed by three theoretical perspectives: choice architecture, the broken windows theory, and the theory of normative social behavior. We also describe a mixed-methods approach to develop the intervention, which will improve the physical and social environments of health facilities in Makwanpur, Nepal. We hypothesize this intervention will improve immunization behaviors and intentions among mothers of children younger than 2 years, pregnant women, and prospective mothers. Methods: We describe the qualitative formative assessment to understand existing attitudes, norms, and behaviors among caregivers, healthcare workers, and government representatives. The formative assessment will include in-depth interviews, key informant interviews, and focus group discussions. We also describe the overall quasi-experimental study design, used to assess intervention impact. Impact: This study will contribute to the social and behavioral change communication intervention research by offering a novel strategy for increasing immunization.

We assessed the feasibility and impact of telehealth visits on the time-in-range (TIR) of pediatric individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Methods: An observational multicenter real-life study. Patients scheduled for an in-clinic visit during the lockdown were offered to participate in a telehealth visit. Sociodemographic, clinical, continuous glucose monitor and pump data were recorded 2 weeks prior and 2 weeks after telehealth visit. The primary endpoint was change in relative-TIR, i.e change in TIR divided by the percent of possible change (∆TIR/(100-TIRbefore)*100). Results: The study group comprised 195 individuals with T1D (47.7% males), mean±SD age 14.6±5.3 years, diabetes duration 6.0±4.6 years. Telehealth was accomplished with 121 patients and their parents (62.0%); 74 (38.0%) did not transfer complete data. Mean TIR was significantly higher for the two-week period after the telehealth visit than for the two-week period prior the visit (62.9±16.0, p<0.001 vs. 59.0±17.2); the improvement in relative-TIR was 5.7±26.1%. Initial higher mean glucose level, lower TIR, less time spent at <54 mg/dl range, longer time spent at 180–250 mg/dl range, higher daily insulin dose and single parent household were associated with improved relative-TIR. Multiple regression logistic analysis demonstrated only initial lower TIR and single-parent household were significant, odds ratio: -0.506, (95%CI -0.99,-0.023), p=0.04 and 13.82, (95%CI 0.621, 27.016), p=0.04, respectively.

In doing so, we use monthly administrative data, and take value-added tax payment changes as a proxy for the demand shock. We merge data with COVID-19 tests, classified by economic activity, and employ a fixed effects instrumental variable regression. We find that all sized firms in the manufacturing sector reduced employment more if they had uncovered tax liabilities before the lockdown. Among small firms, real estate and service sector firms downsized more rapidly. While employment changes are rather modest, this very early evidence points to the need to address liquidity needs and firm pre-conditions among capital-intensive and services firms and, in particular, small businesses, to avoid employment losses. Plain English Summary The administrative data from the first COVID-19 lockdown in 2020 point to the need to address liquidity requirements among manufacturers, capital-intensive and service firms, and, in particular, small businesses to avoid subsequent employment losses. While there is a vast literature on firms’ adaptation and adjustments in the face of adverse shocks, firms’ reactions and the macroeconomic implications of stringent, government-imposed lockdowns are much less understood due to their novelty. We analyze businesses’ responses to the first and very stringent lockdown in March 2020 by making use of monthly administrative data and taking value-added tax payment changes as a proxy for the demand shock. We exploit variation in the sectoral differences across small, medium, and large firms. A simple average employment adjustment was non-negative in agriculture, construction, information and communication, and public administration sectors in our sample. By merging data with COVID-19 tests, classified by economic activity, and employing a fixed-effects instrumental variable regression, we find that all sized firms in the manufacturing sector reduced employment more if they had uncovered tax liabilities before the lockdown. Among small firms, real estate and service sector firms downsized more rapidly. While employment changes are rather modest, this very early evidence about businesses’ reactions to COVID-19-induced uncertainty and activity restrictions points to the need to address business liquidity needs early on. Another policy message concerns the importance of firm pre-conditions among capital-intensive and services firms and, in particular, small businesses to avoid subsequent employment losses.","Lastauskas, Povilas",Small Bus Econ,18,1

Few studies have examined the relationship between medication literacy and frailty in patients with CHD. The aim of this study was to investigate the state of medication literacy and frailty in patients with CHD and to explore the relationship between medication literacy and frailty. Methods: A cross-sectional investigation evaluated 295 inpatients with CHD recruited from hospitals in Yangzhou, China. Demographic and clinical data on participants were collected using a general information questionnaire. The Chinese medication literacy scale was used to evaluate medication literacy. The Fried Frailty Phenotype scale was used to evaluate frailty. Univariate analysis employed chi-square test and Kruskal-Wallis H test to examine the potential factors affecting frailty. Taking frailty status as the outcome variable, the ordered logistic regression model was used to analyze the relationship between the degree of medication literacy and frailty. Spearman’s correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlation between medication literacy and frailty. Results: A total of 280 elderly CHD inpatients were included in the analysis. There were 116 (41.4%) individuals with inadequate medication literacy and 89 (31.8%) frail individuals. Ordered logistic regression analysis showed that the age (p < 0.001, OR = 1.089), Charson Comorbidity Index (p = 0.029, OR = 1.300), number of medications taken (p = 0.012, OR = 1.137), and medication literacy (p < 0.05, OR > 1) were independent predictors of debilitating risk factors. The population with inadequate medication literacy had a 2.759 times greater risk of frailty than adequate medication literacy (p < 0.001, OR = 2.759); The population with marginal medication literacy had a 2.239 times greater risk of frailty than adequate medication literacy (p = 0.010, OR = 2.239). Spearman’s correlation analysis showed that the medication literacy grade was associated with the frailty grade in elderly CHD patients (R = -0.260, p < 0.001). Conclusion: The study showed a significant correlation between medical literacy and frailty in patients with CHD. The results suggested that medication literacy was an important consideration in the development, implementation, and evaluation of frailty.","Qu, Jiling; Zhou, Ting; Xue, Mengxin; Sun, Huiping; Shen, Yijing; Liu, Yongbing",Front Pharmacol,18,18

Most surprisingly, given that 7B2 neutralizes weakly, if at all, is that the chimeric CD4/7B2 immunoadhesins exhibit broad and potent neutralization of HIV, comparable to that of well-known neutralizing mAbs. These data add to the growing evidence that enhanced neutralizing activity can be obtained with bifunctional mAbs/immunoadhesins. The enhanced neutralization activity of the CD4/7B2 chimeras may result from cross-linking of the two Env subunits with subsequent inhibition of the pre-fusion conformational events that are necessary for entry.","Pincus, Seth H.; Craig, Ryan B.; Weachter, Lauren; LaBranche, Celia C.; Nabi, Rafiq; Watt, Connie; Raymond, Mark; Peters, Tami; Song, Kejing; Maresh, Grace A.; Montefiori, David C.; Kozlowski, Pamela A.",Vaccines (Basel),18,1

Helicopters are increasingly being used to transport critical medical emergency resources, but it is not easy to distribute medical supplies through helicopter in large-scale public health incidents. In order to solve the above problems, a two-stage combined transportation method for medical supplies based on clustering is proposed in this paper. In the first stage, the quantum bacterial foraging (QBF) algorithm is used to select emergency transit points and divide the medical assistance points. In view of the imbalance of remaining capacity in QBF division, an improved division method (quantum bacterial foraging with capacity constraints (QBFwCC)) is proposed and a ‘helicopter–vehicle’ medical material combined transportation network structure is constructed in consideration of capacity constraints. In the second stage, a transportation route optimization model based on clustering is established to determine the specific transportation route from the emergency transit point to the medical assistance point. The performance of the method proposed in the paper was analyzed through experimental COVID-19 simulation and compared between QBF and QBFwCC. The results show that the method not only achieves the goal of optimization, but also effectively reduces the number of vehicles.","Ning, Tao; Duan, Xiaodong; An, Lu",,18,1

Therefore, the present study was aimed to investigate the relations of job stress dimensions to safety climate and accidents occurrence among the workers using regression models. This cross-sectional study was carried out on 1530 male employees in 2019. People were randomly selected from various departments. The participants filled out the questionnaires, including demographical information and accident history questionnaire, the NIOSH generic job stress questionnaire, and the Nordic safety climate questionnaire. In addition, information on occupational experience and accident history was obtained from the health unit of the petrochemical company. In the end, data were analyzed using statistical tests of bivariate correlation, multivariate correlation, and logistic regression. Based on the bivariate analysis, the variables of job satisfaction (0.998), problem at work (0.900), depression (-0.836), and physical environment (-0.796) among the job stress dimensions had the highest correlation coefficients with the total score of the safety climate, respectively. The results of the logistic regression analysis with the adjustment of the effect of the safety climate indicated that the relationships between the dimensions of the job satisfaction (Wald = 6.50, OR = 4.96, and p-value<0.05) and social supports (Wald = 5.88, OR = 3.20, and p-value<0.05) with the accident occurrence were significant. To increase the positive safety climate and decrease the accident occurrence, industries must try to reduce job stress in the workplaces through controlling the important factors, such as low job satisfaction and poor social supports.","Khoshakhlagh, Amir Hossein; Yazdanirad, Saeid; Hatamnejad, Yaser; Khatooni, Elham; Kabir, Sohag; Tajpoor, Ali",Heliyon,18,33

Additionally, the study examined the effects of PB on academic achievement in listening and reading comprehension skills of the participants as well as exploring learners’ and their instructor’s perceptions of using PB techniques in their classrooms. The sample consisted of 140 sophomore English language learners. Two intact classes, each comprising 70 participants, were selected as the experimental and the control group using convenience sampling. Two basic PB techniques, Nadi Shodhana Pranayama and Bhramari Pranayama, were implemented to the experimental group on a weekly basis for a total of 7 weeks. In this mixed-method study, the quantitative data were gathered using English Language Learning Anxiety Scale, Foreign Language Test Anxiety Scale, and listening and reading achievement pre- and post-tests, while the qualitative data were collected using semi-structured interviews, and the teacher’s reflective journal. The findings revealed that the implementation of positive psychology technique of pranayama breathing mitigated the FLLA and TA levels significantly and also improved listening and reading comprehension skills of the participants to a considerable extent. The findings also demonstrated that both the students and their instructor perceived PB implementation as a useful and a practical medium in alleviating the anxious feelings, promoting the general class atmosphere and regulating daily habits despite the implementational challenges shared by the instructor.","Tasan, Murselin; Mede, Enisa; Sadeghi, Karim",Front Psychol,18,1

Two-week-old, specific-pathogen-free chickens were subcutaneously inoculated with a single dose of the vaccine containing 106.7 50% embryo infective dose (EID50) of the inactivated virus. At 6 weeks of age, the chickens were challenged with 104 EID50 of the same virus strain via the oculonasal route. In comparison with the unvaccinated challenged group, the vaccinated chickens had significantly higher IBV-neutralizing antibody titers and exhibited efficient protection against challenge on the basis of tracheal ciliary activity. However, the challenge virus was recovered from the kidneys and tracheas of these chickens at rates of 40% and 60%, respectively.

One strategy to increase elicited neutralization breadth involves vaccine priming of immune responses against a target site of vulnerability followed by vaccine boosting of these responses with prefusion-closed Env trimers. This strategy has succeeded at the fusion peptide (FP)-site of vulnerability in eliciting cross-clade neutralizing responses in standard vaccine-test animals. However, the breadth and potency of the elicited responses have been less than optimal. Here we identify three mutations (3mut) - Met302, Leu320, and Pro329 - that stabilize the apex of the Env trimer in a prefusion-closed conformation and show antigenically, structurally and immunogenically that combining 3mut with other approaches (e.g. repair-and-stabilize and glycine-helix breaking) yields well-behaved clade C-Env trimers capable of boosting the breadth of FP-directed responses. Crystal structures of these trimers confirmed prefusion-closed apexes stabilized by hydrophobic patches contributed by Met302 and Leu320, with Pro329 assuming canonically restricted dihedral angles. We substituted the N-terminal eight residues of FP (FP8, residues 512-519) of these trimers with the second most prevalent FP8 sequence (FP8v2, AVGLGAVF), and observed a 3mut-stabilized consensus clade C-Env trimer with FP8v2 to boost the breadth elicited in guinea pigs of FP-directed responses induced by immunogens containing the most prevalent FP8 sequence (FP8v1, AVGIGAVF). Overall, 3mut can stabilize the Env-trimer apex, and the resultant apex-stabilized Env trimers can be used to expand the neutralization breadth elicited against the FP-site of vulnerability.IMPORTANCE A major hurdle to the development of an effective HIV-1 vaccine is the elicitation of serum responses capable of neutralizing circulating strains of HIV, which are extraordinarily diverse in sequence and often highly neutralization resistant. Recently, we showed how sera with 20-30% neutralization breadth could, nevertheless, be elicited in standard vaccine-test animals by priming with the most prevalent N-terminal 8 residues of the HIV-1 fusion peptide (FP8) followed by boosting with a stabilized BG505-envelope (Env) trimer. Here we show that subsequent boosting with a '3mut' apex-stabilized consensus C-Env trimer, modified to have the second most prevalent FP8 sequence, elicits higher neutralization breadth than induced by continued boosting with the stabilized BG505-Env trimer. With increased neutralizing breadth elicited by boosting with a heterologous trimer containing the second most prevalent FP8 sequence, the fusion peptide-directed immune-focusing approach moves a step closer toward realizing an effective HIV-1 vaccine regimen.","Chuang, Gwo-Yu; Lai, Yen-Ting; Boyington, Jeffrey C; Cheng, Cheng; Geng, Hui; Narpala, Sandeep; Rawi, Reda; Schmidt, Stephen D; Tsybovsky, Yaroslav; Verardi, Raffaello; Xu, Kai; Yang, Yongping; Zhang, Baoshan; Chambers, Michael; Changela, Anita; Corrigan, Angela R; Kong, Rui; Olia, Adam S; Ou, Li; Sarfo, Edward K; Wang, Shuishu; Wu, Winston; Doria-Rose, Nicole A; McDermotta, Adrian B; Mascola, John R; Kwong, Peter D",Journal of virology,18,12

The non-structural protein NS4 is the only AHSV protein that localizes to the nucleus. Here we report that all AHSV reference and representative field strains express one of the two forms of NS4, i.e. NS4-I or NS4-II. Both forms of NS4 are nucleocytoplasmic proteins, but NS4-I has a stronger nuclear presence whilst NS4-II has a proportionally higher cytoplasmic distribution. A subtype of NS4-II containing a nuclear localization signal (NLS), named NLS-NS4-II, displays distinct punctate foci in the nucleus. We showed that NS4 likely enters the nucleus via passive diffusion as a result of its small size. Colocalization analysis with nuclear compartments revealed that NS4 colocalizes with promyelocytic leukaemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs), suggesting a role in the antiviral response or interferon signalling. Interestingly, we showed that two other AHSV proteins also interact with nuclear components. A small fraction of the NS1 tubules were present in the nucleus and associated with PML-NBs; this was more pronounced for a virus strain lacking NS4. A component of nuclear speckles, serine and arginine rich splicing factor 2 (SRSF2) was recruited to viral inclusion bodies (VIBs) in the cytoplasm of AHSV-infected cells and colocalized with NS2. Nuclear speckles are important sites for cellular mRNA transcript processing and maturation. Collectively, these results provide data on three AHSV non-structural proteins interacting with host cell nuclear components that could contribute to overcoming antiviral responses and creating conditions that will favour viral replication.","Boughan, Shareen; Potgieter, A Christiaan; van Staden, Vida",The Journal of general virology,18,1

We evaluated whether gastrojejunal stoma diameter is a risk factor for weight regain after RYGB. METHODS We examined data collected over 4 years from consecutive patients referred to a tertiary care bariatric center for upper endoscopy after RYGB. We used linear regression analysis to determine the association between the gastrojejunal stoma diameter and weight regain. We applied a logistic regression model using clinical and endoscopic parameters to develop a prediction rule for weight gain after RYGB. RESULTS Among 165 patients included in our study, 59% had significant weight regain (≥ 20% of maximum weight lost after the RYGB) and 41% did not. The mean percentage of maximal weight lost after RYGB that was regained in the entire cohort was 30% ± 22%. Gastrojejunal stoma diameter was associated significantly with weight regain after RYGB surgery in univariate analysis (β = .31, P < .0001). This association remained significant after adjusting for several known or purported risk factors for weight regain (β = .19, P = .003). We developed a simple prediction rule for weight regain after RYGB using a 7-point scoring system that includes the gastrojejunal stoma diameter, race, and percentage of maximal body weight lost after RYGB; a cut-off score of 4 or more points had an area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.76 and a positive predictive value of 75%. CONCLUSIONS Increased gastrojejunal stoma diameter is a risk factor for weight regain after RYGB and can be incorporated in a novel prediction rule.","Abu Dayyeh, Barham K; Lautz, David B; Thompson, Christopher C",Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association,18,7

With already very low levels of cervical screening below 30%, and vaccination levels that are below levels that award any population effect at 0.3% of the eligible population, cervical cancer mortality is higher than other similar high-income countries at 4.4/100,000 (2900) deaths per year in 2015. There is limited population-based or nationally representative data for HPV genotype distribution in Japan, thus making an assessment of the burden of vaccine-preventable cervical cancer difficult. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aims to determine the HPV genotype prevalence and age distribution of HPV infection in women with a cytological or histological diagnosis of normal through cervical cancer in Japan. We anticipate this information will guide and enhance programme interventions to reduce vaccine-preventable cervical cancer mortality in Japan. METHODS PubMed, Embase and the Japan Medical Abstract Society Database will be searched from the date of establishment to March 2021 to identify original research articles that report the prevalence of HPV genotypes in Japanese women with normal cervical cytology, low grade, high grade and cancerous cervical lesions. No exclusion criteria relating to language or publication date will be applied. The quality of the studies will be assessed using the Joanna Briggs checklist for prevalence studies. Randomised control trials, cohort studies, cross-sectional and prevalence studies will be considered eligible. Study findings will be combined using a traditional random-effects or fixed-effects meta-analysis to summarise pooled prevalence and 95% confidence intervals depending on heterogeneity. Subgroup analyses and meta-regression will be used to investigate heterogeneity, and sensitivity analyses will be conducted to assess the robustness of the findings. DISCUSSION To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review protocol that includes both Japanese and English peer-reviewed articles for the determination of genotype-specific HPV prevalence in cytological or histological confirmed normal cervical specimens, low- and high-grade intraepithelial lesions and cervical cancers by age in Japan. We anticipate this information will guide and enhance programme interventions to reduce vaccine-preventable cervical cancer mortality in Japan.

RNAi is a transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene silencing mechanism in which, double-stranded RNA or hairpin RNA is cleaved by an RNase III-type enzyme called Dicer into small interfering RNA duplex. This subsequently directs sequence-specific, homology dependent, Watson-Crick base-pairing post-transcriptional gene silencing by binding to its complementary RNA and initiating its elimination through degradation or by persuading translational inhibition. In plants, worms, and insects, RNAi is the main and strong antiviral defense mechanism. It is clear that RNAi silencing, contributes in restriction of viral infection in vertebrates. In a short period, RNAi has progressed to become a significant experimental tool for the analysis of gene function and target validation in mammalian systems. In addition, RNA silencing has then been found to be involved in translational repression, transcriptional inhibition, and DNA degradation. RNAi machinery required for robust RNAi-mediated antiviral response are conserved throughout evolution in mammals and plays a crucial role in antiviral defense of invertebrates, but despite these important functions RNAi contribution to mammalian antiviral innate immune defense has been underestimated and disputed. In this article, we review the literature concerning the roles of RNAi as components of innate immune system in mammals and how, the RNAi is currently one of the most hopeful new advances toward disease therapy. This review highlights the potential of RNAi as a therapeutic strategy for viral infection and gene regulation to modulate host immune response to viral infection.","Sidahmed, Abubaker; Abdalla, Shaza; Mahmud, Salahedin; Wilkie, Bruce",Journal of infection in developing countries,18,31

RECENT FINDINGS The emphasis on sepsis pathophysiology has moved away from the pathogen - the initiating factor - and instead is focussed upon the abnormal and exaggerated host response. Instead of targeted eradication of the infection, the host response activates or suppresses multiple downstream pathways, leading to multiple organ dysfunction. SUMMARY Sepsis represents a dysregulated host response to infection leading to organ dysfunction. Here, the pathogen triggers an initial exaggerated inflammatory-immune response that leads to activation or suppression of multiple endothelial, hormonal, bioenergetic, metabolic, immune, and other pathways. These, in turn, produce the circulatory and metabolic perturbations resulting in organ dysfunction. This review will provide an overview of underlying mechanisms and propose that these processes, whereas superficially viewed as dysfunctional, may actually be adaptive/protective in the first instance, though spilling over into maladaptation/harm depending on the magnitude of the host response.","Arina, Pietro; Singer, Mervyn",Current opinion in anaesthesiology,18,20

These metabolic changes lead to loss of cell integrity, which induces dehydration intracellular and increase extracellular fluid. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA)-derived phase angle (PhA) is considered a good tool to evaluate hydration status, but in cancer patients it is not fully elucidated. Thus, in cancer patients the aims of this study were to (1) verify the association between PhA and fatigue, (2) verify the association between PhA and fatigue after adjustment for extracellular fluid accumulation, and (3) assess the prevalence of fatigue. This cross-sectional study was conducted with 124 patients of both genders on cancer treatment. Body weight, height, body mass index, handgrip strength, performance status, and cachexia were collected. In addition, body composition was evaluated by BIA to obtain hydration status and PA. The cut-off point used to classify patients with low PhA was set <4°. To identify fatigue, the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Fatigue questionnaire was applied. Of the 124 patients evaluated (n = 98/79% men), 26% had fatigue. The prevalence of fatigue was higher in patients with lower PhA <4° (65.63%). In the logistic regression analyses, we found that patients with PhA >4° had lower risk for fatigue (OR: 0.92 95% CI [0.86-0.99], p = 0.03) in the crude model, however after adjustments by weight loss percentage in 6 months, age, sex, and hydration the association was not maintained (OR: 0.94 95% CI [0.85-1.04], p = 0.26). In conclusion, we found that ~26% of cancer patients have fatigue. In spite of adjustment for extracellular fluid, PhA is not associated with fatigue. The importance of measuring PhA to assess intra and extracellular hydration in cancer patients is highlighted.","Gomes, Tatyanne L N; Soares, Jéssika D P; Borges, Thaís C; Pichard, Claude; Pimentel, Gustavo D",European journal of clinical nutrition,18,7

This may result in drug-drug interactions (DDIs) that are often overlooked in clinical practice. Elderly patients are more affected by comorbidities increasing the risk of DDIs and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Statins are effective in elderly patients with or at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and are prescribed on a long-term basis and may undergo DDIs, particularly on pharmacokinetic bases. The risk of DDIs varies among statins, and safety and ADRs of statins are of special concern in patients affected by multiple chronic conditions requiring concomitant therapies at risk of DDIs, such as the elderly. AREAS COVERED The purpose of this manuscript is to give an update on the potential statin DDIs and related ADRs with an exclusive focus on the data available in elderly patients.

In fact, the rural United States is home to disproportionate shares of older and sicker people, there are large and growing rural-urban and within-rural mortality disparities, many rural communities are in population decline, and rural racial/ethnic diversity is increasing.Yet rural communities are not monolithic, and although some rural places are characterized by declining health, others have seen large improvements in population health. We draw on these realities to call for new research in five areas.First, research is needed to better describe health disparities between rural and urban areas and, because rural places are not monolithic, across rural America. Second, research is needed on how trends in rural population health and aging are affecting rural communities. Third, research is needed on the ways in which economic well-being and livelihood strategies interact with rural health and aging. Fourth, we need to better understand the health implications of the physical and social isolation characterizing many rural communities. Finally, we argue for new research on the implications of local natural environments and climate change for rural population health and aging. (Am J Public Health.

It can be hijacked by various viruses to facilitate their replication. In this study, we found that PRRSV infection significantly increases the number of double- or single-membrane vesicles in the cytoplasm of host cells in ultrastructural analysis. Our results showed the LC3-I was converted into LC3-II after virus infection, suggesting the autophagy machinery was activated. We further used pharmacological agents and shRNAs to confirm that autophagy promoted the replication of PRRSV in host cells. Confocal microscopy analysis showed that PRRSV inhibited the fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes, suggesting that PRRSV induced incomplete autophagy. This suppression caused the accumulation of autophagosomes which may serve as replication site to enhance PRRSV replication. It has been shown that NSP2 and NSP3 of arterivirus are two components of virus replication complex. We also found in our studies that NSP2 colocalized with LC3 in MARC-145 cells by performing confocal microscopy analysis and continuous density gradient centrifugation. Our studies presented here indicated that autophagy was activated during PRRSV infection and enhanced PRRSV replication in host cells by preventing autophagosome and lysosome fusion.","Sun, Ming-Xia; Huang, Li; Wang, Rui; Yu, Ya-Ling; Li, Chen; Li, Peng-Peng; Hu, Xiao-Chun; Hao, Hong-Ping; Ishag, Hassan A; Mao, Xiang",Autophagy,18,26

OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to investigate the neuropsychiatric effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in MS patients and to analyze the risk factors contributing to psychological stress. METHODS The study was designed as a prospective, cross-sectional survey study. Multiple assessment tools that are used in neurological practice, including Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 (MSQOL-54) were administered prospectively both during the early and the peak stages of COVID-19 outbreak (ESO and PSO, respectively). The survey forms were designed using SurveyMonkey and the participants were participating in the survey via a web link and QR code. RESULTS Fifty patients were included in the study. BDI scores, PSQI and FSI measurements, cognitive and social subscale scores and total FIS score, MSQOL-54 measurements, physical and mental subscale scores, and total MSQOL-54 score at PSO were significantly different than those at ESO. The body mass index values of the patients increased significantly at PSO compared to those measured at ESO. CONCLUSIONS The results provide a basis for the development of psychological interventions that could minimize the prevalence of sleep disorders and depression and could improve patients' quality of life during the outbreak.","Demir, Caner Feyzi; Bilek, Furkan; Balgetir, Ferhat",Arquivos de neuro-psiquiatria,18,12

In the absence of TMPRSS2, SARS-CoV achieves cell entry via an endosomal pathway in which cathepsin L may play an important role, i.e., the activation of spike protein fusogenicity. This study shows that a commercial serine protease inhibitor (camostat) partially blocked infection by SARS-CoV and human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) in HeLa cells expressing the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and TMPRSS2. Simultaneous treatment of the cells with camostat and EST [(23,25)trans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamindo-3-methylbutane ethyl ester], a cathepsin inhibitor, efficiently prevented both cell entry and the multistep growth of SARS-CoV in human Calu-3 airway epithelial cells. This efficient inhibition could be attributed to the dual blockade of entry from the cell surface and through the endosomal pathway. These observations suggest camostat as a candidate antiviral drug to prevent or depress TMPRSS2-dependent infection by SARS-CoV.","Kawase, Miyuki; Shirato, Kazuya; van der Hoek, Lia; Taguchi, Fumihiro; Matsuyama, Shutoku",Journal of virology,18,14

It is emphasized that if the term from the recent anticancer treatment to the diagnosis of COVID-19 was short, the probability of serious events increased in cancer patients. Therefore, early detection of COVID-19 and prevention of serious events is very important. We aimed to investigate whether it is possible to detect COVID-19 early by positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT). Methods We retrospectively evaluated the images and clinical findings of patients who underwent PET/CT due to malignancy and whose COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test were detected positive subsequently. Results Eight cancer patients with positive COVID-19 PCR tests were included in the study. PET/CT revealed subpleural ground-glass opacities (GGOs) showing mild fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake that could be compatible with COVID-19 in 4 of 8 patients. The number of affected lobes ranged from 1-4. All patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 by PCR test when symptoms and/or lung findings worsened on the days after PET/CT. The time interval between the last anticancer treatment and COVID-19 diagnosis in five patients was ≤7 days. During the follow-up, six of the cases (75%) needed mechanical ventilation and died later. Conclusion COVID-19 may be recognised early by detecting incidental findings in PET/CT, especially in asymptomatic cancer patients. Potential complications may be prevented by early diagnosis and anticancer therapy changes. Therefore, possible COVID-19 findings in PET/CT should be reported and the patient should be referred to relevant clinician.","Tekin, Duygu; Budak, Emine; Yoldas, Banu; Budak, Adnan",Indian journal of cancer,18,16

In the following article, an attempt has been made to identify main problems regarding the biological security in large workplaces outside the healthcare sector, while simultaneously pointing out the possible solutions to these problems. In this article, a literature review was performed with regard to publications that have been published within the last 4 months, concerning the issue of risk factors with regard to SARS-CoV-2 infections in large populations. Experts' opinions and statements released by institutions working in this field were also taken into consideration. On the basis of the available publications, key procedures to protect workers in large workplaces against COVID-19 were established. One of these key factors is infection prevention. It is commonly known that, due to limited possibilities of identifying infected people that are asymptomatic, physical distance in the whole employee population should be kept; personal protective equipment (PPE) should be used and tele-work should be implemented. The results of recent research have shown that, apart from airborne ways of transmission, there also exists a possibility of getting infected by coming into contact with contaminated surfaces and objects. Therefore, frequent disinfection of rooms and work tools is essential. In the current situation, due to the lack of a vaccine, only going through the COVID-19 disease, either in a symptomatic or asymptomatic form, significantly increases the chances of developing natural immunity. The means of preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections include quickly identifying the infected people on the basis of the symptoms they report, keeping physical distance, using PPE, disinfecting rooms and applying proper ventilation. Limiting the number of workers by implementing a remote work pattern is also recommended. Med Pr. 2021;72(1):89-97.","Hanke, Wojciech; Pietrzak, Patrycja",Medycyna pracy,18,24

This study aimed to develop and validate an ex vivo human-like respiratory tract model easy to use and relevant to compare to in vivo human data. A human plastinated head is connected to an ex vivo porcine pulmonary tract ventilated artificially by passive expansion. A physiological study measures ""pleural"" depressions, tidal volumes, and minute ventilation for the respiratory rates chosen (10, 15, and 20 per minute) with three inspiratory/expiratory ratios (1/1, 1/2, and 1/3). Scintigraphy with 81mKrypton assesses the homogeneity of the ventilation. Forty different experiments were set for validation, with 36 (90%) ventilating successfully. At a respiratory rate of 15/minute with inspiratory/expiratory ratio of 1/2, the tidal volume average was 824 mL (standard deviation, 207 mL). The scintigraphy performed on 16 ex vivo models (44.4%), showed homogenous ventilation with great similarity to human physiological studies. Ratio of the peripheral to central count rates were equally correlated with human data published in the literature. This new model, combining research feasibility and human physiology likeness, provides a realistic approach to human inhalation and therefore can be an interesting tool in aerosol regional deposition studies.","Perinel, Sophie; Pourchez, Jérémie; Leclerc, Lara; Avet, John; Durand, Marc; Prévôt, Nathalie; Cottier, Michèle; Vergnon, Jean M",Scientific reports,18,26
68940,68940,68940,Productive replication of Ebola virus is regulated by the c-Abl1 tyrosine kinase.,12.8161,7.4598756,2012,"Macrophages contain large amounts of arachidonic acid (AA), which distributes differentially across membrane phospholipids. This is largely due to the action of coenzyme A-independent transacylase (CoA-IT), which transfers the AA primarily from diacyl choline-containing phospholipids to ethanolamine-containing phospholipids. In this work we have comparatively analyzed glycerophospholipid changes leading to AA mobilization in mouse peritoneal macrophages responding to either zymosan or serum-opsonized zymosan (OpZ). These two phagocytic stimuli promote the cytosolic phospholipase A2-dependent mobilization of AA by activating distinct surface receptors. Application of mass spectrometry-based lipid profiling to identify changes in AA-containing phospholipids during macrophage exposure to both stimuli revealed significant decreases in the levels of all major choline phospholipid molecular species and a major phosphatidylinositol species. Importantly, while no changes in ethanolamine phospholipid species were detected on stimulation with zymosan, significant decreases in these species were observed when OpZ was used. Analyses of CoA-IT-mediated AA remodeling revealed that the process occurred faster in the zymosan-stimulated cells compared with OpZ-stimulated cells. Pharmacological inhibition of CoA-IT strongly blunted AA release in response to zymosan but had only a moderate effect on the OpZ-mediated response. These results suggest a hitherto undescribed receptor-dependent role for CoA-independent AA remodeling reactions in modulating the eicosanoid biosynthetic response of macrophages. Our data help define novel targets within the AA remodeling pathway with potential use to control lipid mediator formation.","Gil-de-Gómez, Luis; Monge, Patricia; Rodríguez, Juan P; Astudillo, Alma M; Balboa, María A; Balsinde, Jesús",Biomedicines,18,16

METHODS To identify respiratory virus burden and assess months with epidemic activity, we followed a birth cohort in northwest Ecuador during 2011-2014. Mothers brought children to the study clinic for routine checkups at ages 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8 years or if children experienced any acute respiratory illness symptoms (e.g., cough, fever, or difficulty breathing); clinical care was provided free of charge. Those with medically attended acute respiratory infections (MAARIs) were tested for common respiratory viruses via real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). RESULTS In 2011, 2376 children aged 1-4 years (median 35 months) were enrolled in the respiratory cohort and monitored for 7017.5 child-years (cy). The incidence of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was 23.9 (95% CI 17.3-30.5), influenza 10.6 (2.4-18.8), adenoviruses 6.7 (4.6-28.0), parainfluenzas 5.0 (2.3-10.5), and rhinoviruses, bocaviruses, human metapneumoviruses, seasonal coronaviruses, and enteroviruses <3/100 cy among children aged 12-23 months and declined with age. Most (75%) influenza detections occurred April-September. CONCLUSION Cohort children frequently had MAARIs, and while the incidence decreased rapidly among older children, more than one in five children aged 12-23 months tested positive for RSV, and one in 10 tested positive for influenza.

Informant questionnaires are frequently used to assess for dementia in clinical practice. Recent systematic reviews have sought to establish the diagnostic test accuracy of various dementia informant screening tools. However, most reviews to date have focused on a single diagnostic tool and this does not address which tool is 'best'. A key aim of the overview of systematic reviews is to present a disparate evidence base in a single, easy to access platform. METHODS We will conduct an overview of systematic reviews in which we 'review the systematic reviews' of diagnostic test accuracy studies evaluating informant questionnaires for dementia. As an overview of systematic reviews of test accuracy is a relatively novel approach, we will use this review to explore methods for visual representation of complex data, for highlighting evidence gaps and for indirect comparative analyses. We will create a list of informant tools by consulting with dementia experts. We will search 6 databases (EMBASE (OVID); Health and Psychosocial Instruments (OVID); Medline (OVID); CINAHL (EBSCO); PSYCHinfo (EBSCO) and the PROSPERO registry of review protocols) to identify systematic reviews that describe the diagnostic test accuracy of informant questionnaires for dementia. We will assess review quality using the AMSTAR-2 (Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews) and assess reporting quality using PRISMA-DTA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies) checklists. We will collate the identified reviews to create an 'evidence map' that highlights where evidence does and does not exist in relation to informant questionnaires. We will pool sensitivity and specificity data via meta-analysis to generate a diagnostic test accuracy summary statistic for each informant questionnaire. If data allow, we will perform a statistical comparison of the diagnostic test accuracy of each informant questionnaire using a network approach. DISCUSSION Our overview of systematic reviews will provide a concise summary of the diagnostic test accuracy of informant tools and highlight areas where evidence is currently lacking in this regard.

WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN A description of the new view of the RAS, along with the key findings that support it. In the cardiovascular system, the ACE2/angiotensin 1 - 7/Mas axis, mainly through the inhibition of fibrosis, inflammation, thrombosis and cell proliferation, modulates RAS activity with significant pathophysiological implications in clinical conditions such as hypertension, myocardial ischemia and heart failure. A more complete understanding of this axis has significant therapeutic relevance and a major effort is being carried out in order to pursue this objective. TAKE HOME MESSAGE There is increasing evidence that ACE2/angiotensin 1 - 7/Mas receptor axis has a key role in RAS activity regulation with significant pathophysiological implications in several disease states.

Methods: Survey of outpatient MH/SUD clinicians (psychiatrists, nurse practitioners, psychologists, and licensed clinical social workers; N = 107) at a psychiatric hospital. Clinician satisfaction and experiences using telehealth across a variety of services (individual, group or family therapy, initial assessments, evaluation and management, and neuropsychological assessment) were assessed using a mixed-methods approach. Results: Across services, a majority agreed/strongly agreed that telehealth provided an opportunity to build rapport with patients (67-88%) and they could treat their patients' needs well (71-88%). The interest in continuing to use telehealth when in-person visits resume varied by type of service provided (50-71%). Group therapy and initial assessment were lowest (50% and 51%, respectively). Clinicians noted telehealth improved access to care for patients with logistical barriers, competing demands, mobility difficulties, and medical concerns; but was more challenging to care for patients with certain psychiatric characteristics (e.g., psychosis, paranoia, catatonia, high distractibility, and avoidance), high symptom severity, or who needed to improve social skills. Telehealth influenced the therapeutic process (e.g., observations of family dynamic, increased patient/clinician therapeutic alliance). Discussion and Conclusions: MH/SUD clinicians who quickly transitioned to telehealth care during the pandemic were largely satisfied with telehealth, but also identified challenges related to specific patient characteristics, or types of MH/SUD services. These observations warrant additional study to better delineate the role for an expanded use of telehealth postpandemic.","Sugarman, Dawn E; Horvitz, Lisa E; Greenfield, Shelly F; Busch, Alisa B",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,18,1

The RIME (reporter-interpreter-manager-educator) schema was originally developed as a synthetic and intuitive assessment framework for internal medicine clerkships. Validity evidence of this framework has not been rigorously evaluated outside of internal medicine. This study examined factors contributing to variability in RIME assessment scores using generalizability theory and decision studies across multiple clerkships, thereby contributing to its internal structure validity evidence. METHOD Data were collected from RIME-based summative clerkship assessments during 2018-2019 at Virginia Commonwealth University. Generalizability theory was used to explore variance attributed to different facets through a series of unbalanced random-effects models by clerkship. For all analyses, decision (D-) studies were conducted to estimate the effects of increasing the number of assessments. RESULTS From 231 students, 6,915 observations were analyzed. Interpreter was the most common RIME designation (44.5%-46.8%) across all clerkships. Variability attributable to students ranged from 16.7% in neurology to 25.4% in surgery. D-studies showed the number of assessments needed to achieve an acceptable reliability (0.7) ranged from 7 in pediatrics and surgery to 11 in internal medicine and 12 in neurology. However, depending on the clerkship each student received between 3 to 8 assessments. CONCLUSIONS This study conducted generalizability and D-studies to examine the internal structure validity evidence of RIME clinical performance assessments across clinical clerkships. Substantial proportion of variance in RIME assessment scores was attributable to the rater, with less attributed to the student. However, the proportion of variance attributed to the student was greater than what has been demonstrated in other generalizability studies of summative clinical assessments. Overall, this findings support the use of RIME as a framework for assessment across clerkships and demonstrate the number of assessments required to obtain sufficient reliability.","Ryan, Michael S; Lee, Bennett; Richards, Alicia; Perera, Robert A; Haley, Kellen; Rigby, Fidelma B; Park, Yoon Soo; Santen, Sally A",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,18,26

In addition, there are few comparative studies with conventional laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal (CLTEP) hernioplasty. The aim of the present study was to report our experience with SPLTEP hernioplasty and to compare short-term outcomes for SPLTEP hernioplasty with CLTEP hernioplasty. METHODS Data were prospectively collected for all patients undergoing SPLTEP hernioplasty for inguinal hernia at Incheon St. Mary's Hospital, Incheon, Korea. Data for the SPLTEP group (n = 76 patients enrolled between June 2010 and May 2011) were compared retrospectively with data for the CLTEP group (n = 93 patients enrolled between June 2009 and May 2010). RESULTS There were no significant differences in patient demographics. This study showed no significant difference in terms of operative time between the two groups (SPLTEP group 54.0 min vs. CLTEP group 47.8 min; p = 0.07). There were no conversions to conventional TEP hernioplasty or transabdominal preperitoneal hernioplasty or open surgery in SPLTEP hernioplasty. Morbidity rates were 7.9 % (n = 6) in the SPLTEP group and 10.8 % (n = 10) in the CLTEP group, and the difference was not significant. CONCLUSIONS Single port laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal hernioplasty is technically feasible and the short-term operative outcome is comparable to that of CLTEP hernioplasty. Future large-scale prospective controlled studies and long-term analysis are needed to establish the cosmetic outcomes, quality of life, long-term recurrence rate, and long-term complication rate of SPLTEP hernioplasty.","Kim, Ji Hoon; Lee, Yoon Suk; Kim, Jin Jo; Park, Seung Man",World journal of surgery,18,7

As many studies have shown, three-dimensional (3D) technologies used in online lectures can serve as alternatives to real specimens for providing knowledge of anatomy. However, such technologies are often expensive. The goal of this study was to create three-dimensional anatomy models for online lectures using a free cellphone app. METHODS Free application software (Qlone) was used to create 3D anatomical models. The extracranium and intracranium of adult skull, fetal skull, mandible, temporal bone, second cervical vertebra, and ilium were all scanned and exported to the computer in 3D format. A total of 53 anatomical structures were evaluated by nine observers. RESULTS Although the 53 structures used in this study did not include all the structures that students need to learn, visibility was good/acceptable for most of the 53. CONCLUSIONS The free and simple 3D scanning app used in this study could enable anatomy educators to provide better content to students during online lectures.","Iwanaga, Joe; Terada, Satoshi; Kim, Hee-Jin; Tabira, Yoko; Arakawa, Takamitsu; Watanabe, Koichi; Dumont, Aaron S; Tubbs, R Shane",Clinical anatomy,18,1

BACKGROUND Severe symptomatic PVR is a predictor of all-cause mortality after TAVR. The current use of devices for transcatheter closure of PVR has been adapted from other indications without known long-term outcomes. METHODS The study population consisted of a series of cases pooled together from an international multicenter experience. Patients underwent transcatheter implantation of a closure device for the treatment of clinically relevant PVR after TAVR with balloon-expandable or self-expandable prostheses. Procedural success was defined by successful deployment of a device with immediate reduction of PVR to a final grade ≤2 as assessed by echocardiography. RESULTS Twenty-seven procedures were performed in 24 patients with clinically relevant PVR after the index TAVR procedure (54.2% Edwards Sapien [Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, California], 45.8% CoreValve [Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota]). The study population included 75% men with a mean age of 80.6 ± 7.1 years and mean Society of Thoracic Surgeon score of 6.6%. The most frequently used device was Amplatzer Vascular Plug (St. Jude Medical, St. Paul, Minnesota) in 80% of the cases. Overall, 88.9% (24 of 27) of the procedures were technically successful and the results assessed by echocardiography were durable. However, cumulative survival rates at 1, 6, and 12 months were 83.3%, 66.7%, and 61.5%. Most of the deaths (8 of 11) were due to noncardiac causes. CONCLUSIONS Transcatheter closure of PVR after TAVR can be performed with a high procedural success rate; however, the long-term mortality remains high mainly due to noncardiac causes.","Saia, Francesco; Martinez, Claudia; Gafoor, Sameer; Singh, Vikas; Ciuca, Cristina; Hofmann, Ilona; Marrozzini, Cinzia; Tan, John; Webb, John; Sievert, Horst; Marzocchi, Antonio; O'Neill, William W",JACC.

Testing data is extremely limited and unreliable, which restricts health authorities' ability to deal with the pandemic. Given the stark demographic, social and economic heterogeneities within Brazilian cities, it is important to identify hotspots so that the limited resources available can have the greatest impact. This study shows that decentralised monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in sewage can be used to assess the distribution of COVID-19 prevalence in the city. The methodology developed in this study allowed the identification of hotspots by comprehensively monitoring sewers distributed through Belo Horizonte, Brazil's third largest city. Our results show that the most vulnerable neighbourhoods in the city were the hardest hit by the pandemic, indicating that, for many Brazilians, the situation is much worse than reported by official figures.","Mota, Cesar R; Bressani-Ribeiro, Thiago; Araújo, Juliana C; Leal, Cíntia D; Leroy-Freitas, Deborah; Machado, Elayne C; Espinosa, Maria Fernanda; Fernandes, Luyara; Leão, Thiago L; Chamhum-Silva, Lucas; Azevedo, Lariza; Morandi, Thiago; Freitas, Gabriel Tadeu O; Costa, Michelle S; Carvalho, Beatriz O; Reis, Marcus Tulius P; Melo, Marília C; Ayrimoraes, Sergio R; Chernicharo, Carlos A L",Water research,18,1

METHODS Discovery Studio 4.5 was used to compare and screen the ligands with the reference drug, solasodine, to identify ideal candidate compounds that could inhibit MMP9. The LibDock module was used to analyze compounds that could strongly bind to MMP9, and the top 20 compounds determined by the LibDock score were selected for further research. ADME and TOPKAT modules were used to choose the safe compounds from these 20 compounds. The selected compounds were analyzed using the CDOCKER module for molecular docking and feature mapping for pharmacophore prediction. The stability of these compound-MMP9 complexes was analyzed by molecular dynamic simulation. Cell counting kit-8, colony-forming, and scratch assays were used to analyze the anti-CCRCC effects of these ligands. RESULTS Strong binding to MMP9 was exhibited by 6,762 ligands. Among the top 20 compounds, sappanol and sventenin exhibited nearly undefined blood-brain barrier level and lower aqueous solubility, carcinogenicity, and hepatotoxicity than the positive control drug, solasodine. Additionally, these compounds exhibited lower potential energies with MMP9, and the ligand-MMP9 complexes were stable in the natural environment. Furthermore, sappanol inhibited CCRCC cell migration and proliferation. CONCLUSION Sappanol and sventenin are safe and reliable compounds to target and inhibit MMP9. Sappanol can CCRCC cell migration and proliferation. These two compounds may give new thought to the targeted therapy for patients with CCRCC.","Liu, Naimeng; Wang, Xinhui; Wu, Hao; Lv, Xiaye; Xie, Haoqun; Guo, Zhen; Wang, Jing; Dou, Gaojing; Zhang, Chenxi; Sun, Mindan",Aging,18,16

METHODS Observer-blind, randomized equivalence clinical trial with two arms (electrocautery versus conventional scalpel) which evaluated 133 women undergoing elective abdominal gynecologic oncology surgery. A simple randomization stratified by body mass index (BMI: 30 kg/m(2)) was carried out. Women were evaluated at 14 and 30 days following the operation. A multivariate analysis was performed in order to check whether the type of scalpel would be a risk factor for SSI. RESULTS Group arms were balanced for all variables, excepted for surgical time, which was significantly higher in the electrocautery group (mean: 161.1 versus 203.5 min, P = 0.029). The rates of SSI were 7.4% and 9.7%, respectively, for the conventional scalpel and electrocautery groups (P = 0.756). The exploratory multivariate model identified body mass index ≥30 kg/m(2) (OR = 24.2, 95% CI: 2.8-212.1) and transverse surgical incision (OR = 8.1, 95% CI: 1.5-42.6) as independent risk factors for SSI. The type of scalpel used in surgery, when adjusted for these variables and the surgery time, was not a risk factor for SSI. CONCLUSION This study showed that the SSI rates for conventional scalpel and electrocautery were not significantly different. These results were consistent with others reported in the literature and would not allow a surgeon to justify scalpel choice based on SSI.

A total of 196 respiratory samples and 148 serum samples (n=344) from 238 patients were retrospectively included, with a maximum of one of each sample type per patient. Cases were retrospectively classified for COVID-19 associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) status following the 2020 consensus criteria, with the exclusion of LFA results as a mycological criterion. At the 1.0 cutoff, sensitivity of LFA for CAPA (proven/probable/possible) was 52%, 80% and 81%, and specificity was 98%, 88% and 67%, for bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), non-directed bronchoalveolar lavage (NBL), and tracheal aspiration (TA), respectively. At the 0.5 manufacturer's cutoff, sensitivity was 72%, 90% and 100%, and specificity was 79%, 83% and 44%, for BALF, NBL and TA, respectively. When combining all respiratory samples, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) was 0.823, versus 0.754, 0.890 and 0.814 for BALF, NBL and TA, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity of serum LFA were 20% and 93%, respectively, at the 0.5 ODI cutoff. Overall, the Aspergillus Galactomannan LFA showed good performances for CAPA diagnosis, when used from respiratory samples at the 1.0 cutoff, while sensitivity from serum was limited, linked to weak invasiveness during CAPA. As some false positive results can occur, isolated results slightly above the recommended cutoff should lead to further mycological investigations.","Autier, Brice; Prattes, Juergen; White, P Lewis; Valerio, Maricela; Machado, Marina; Price, Jessica; Egger, Matthias; Gangneux, Jean-Pierre; Hoenigl, Martin",Journal of clinical microbiology,18,1

Due to the high capacity of diffusion and human infection it has become a new zoonotic pandemic. The absence of a vaccine has determined the search for antiviral drugs with the capacity to inhibit the replication of the new virus. Among them, remdesivir, an analogue of adenosine, is what seems to have a more promising future. This drug has shown in vitro and in animals a high capacity to block infection and viral replication with attainable concentrations in human plasma. Although all studies have been carried out with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, it seems that by virological and functional analogy, remdesivir is one of the few antiviral drugs with proven efficacy.

A double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-binding protein, PACT, plays an important role in potentiating RIG-I function. We have shown previously that arenaviral nucleoproteins (NPs) suppress type I IFN production via their RNase activity to degrade PAMP RNA. We report here that NPs of arenaviruses block the PACT-induced enhancement of RIG-I function to mediate type I IFN production and that this inhibition is dependent on the RNase function of NPs, which is different from that of a known mechanism of other viral proteins to abolish the interaction between PACT and RIG-I. To understand the biological roles of PACT and RIG-I in authentic arenavirus infection, we analyze growth kinetics of recombinant Pichinde virus (PICV), a prototypical arenavirus, in RIG-I knockout (KO) and PACT KO mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells. Wild-type (WT) PICV grew at higher titers in both KO MEF lines than in normal MEFs, suggesting the important roles of these cellular proteins in restricting virus replication. PICV carrying the NP RNase catalytically inactive mutation could not grow in normal MEFs but could replicate to some extent in both KO MEF lines. The level of virus growth was inversely correlated with the amount of type I IFNs produced. These results suggest that PACT plays an important role in potentiating RIG-I function to produce type I IFNs in order to restrict arenavirus replication and that viral NP RNase activity is essential for optimal viral replication by suppressing PACT-induced RIG-I activation.IMPORTANCE We report here a new role of the nucleoproteins of arenaviruses that can block type I IFN production via their specific inhibition of the cellular protein sensors of virus infection (RIG-I and PACT). Our results suggest that PACT plays an important role in potentiating RIG-I function to produce type I IFNs in order to restrict arenavirus replication. This new knowledge can be exploited for the development of novel antiviral treatments and/or vaccines against some arenaviruses that can cause severe and lethal hemorrhagic fever diseases in humans.","Shao, Junjie; Huang, Qinfeng; Liu, Xiaoying; Di, Da; Liang, Yuying; Ly, Hinh",Journal of virology,18,16

Current AUA (American Urological Association) guidelines include thermal ablation as a treatment modality for select individuals. We compared the laparoscopic and percutaneous approach for the radio frequency ablation of renal tumors under the guidance of urological surgeons. MATERIALS AND METHODS We reviewed our radio frequency ablation database of patients with renal masses undergoing laparoscopic or computerized tomography guided percutaneous radio frequency ablation with simultaneous peripheral fiberoptic thermometry from November 2001 to January 2011 at a single tertiary care center. Data were collected on patient demographics, and surgical and clinicopathological outcomes stratified by approach. RESULTS A total of 298 patients with 316 renal tumors underwent laparoscopic (122 tumors) or computerized tomography guided (194 tumors) radio frequency ablation. There were no statistically significant differences between the laparoscopic and computerized tomography guided radio frequency ablation groups with respect to patient demographics, complication rates and renal functional outcomes (p>0.05). The 3-year Kaplan-Meier estimation of radiographic recurrence-free probability was 95% for computerized tomography guided radio frequency ablation and 94% for laparoscopic radio frequency ablation (p=0.84). Subanalysis of the 212 (67%) renal cell carcinoma tumors showed a 3-year Kaplan-Meier estimation of oncologic recurrence-free probability (post-ablation biopsy proven viable tumor) of 94% for computerized tomography guided radio frequency ablation and 100% for laparoscopic radio frequency ablation (p=0.16). Median followup was 21 months for laparoscopic radio frequency ablation) and 19 months for computerized tomography guided radio frequency ablation.

METHODOLOGY This descriptive and cross-sectional study was conducted on 87 confirmed COVID-19 patients. The patients were separated into two groups according to the admission in the ICU or in the ward. MIF was determined batchwise in plasma obtained as soon as the patients were admitted. Both groups were compared with respect to demographic characteristics, biochemical parameters and prediction of requirement to ICU admission. RESULTS Forty seven patients in ICU, and 40 patients in ward were included. With respect to MIF levels and biochemical biomarkers, there was a statistically significant difference between the ICU and ward patients (p< 0.024). In terms of ICU requirement, the cut-off value of MIF was detected as 4.705 (AUC:0.633, 95%CI:0.561-0.79, p= 0.037), D-dimer was 789 (AUC:0.779, 95%CI: 0.681-0.877, p= 0.000), troponin was 8.15 (AUC: 0.820, 95%CI:0.729-0.911, p= 0.000), ferritin was 375 (AUC: 0.774, 95%CI:0.671-0.876, p= 0.000), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was 359.5 (AUC:0.843, 95%CI: 0.753-0.933, p= 0.000). According to the logistic regression analysis; when MIF level > 4.705, the patient's requirement to ICU risk was increased to 8.33 (95%CI: 1.73-44.26, p= 0.009) fold. Similarly, elevation of troponin, ferritin and, LDH was shown to predict disease prognosis (p< 0.05).

Regional lymph node metastasis is associated with a negative prognosis in patients with HCC, and surgical resection of lymph node metastasis is considered feasible and efficacious in improving the survival and prognosis. It is critical to characterize lymph node preoperatively. There is currently no consensus regarding the optimal method for the assessment of regional lymph nodes in patients with HCC. AIM To evaluate the diagnostic value of single source dual energy computed tomography (CT) in regional lymph node assessment for HCC patients. METHODS Forty-three patients with pathologically confirmed HCC who underwent partial hepatectomy with lymphadenectomy were retrospectively enrolled. All patients underwent dual-energy CT preoperatively. Regional lymph nodes (n = 156) were divided into either a metastatic (group P, n = 52) or a non-metastasis group (group N, n = 104), and further, according to pathology, divided into an active hepatitis (group P1, n = 34; group N1, n = 73) and a non-active hepatitis group (group P2, n = 18; group N2, n = 31). The maximal short axis diameter (MSAD), iodine concentration (IC), normalized IC (NIC), and the slope of the spectral curve (λ HU) of each group in the arterial phase (AP), portal phase (PP), and delayed phase (DP) were analyzed. RESULTS Analysis of the MSAD, IC, NIC, and λ HU showed statistical differences between groups P and N (P < 0.05) during all three phases. To distinguish benign from metastatic lymph nodes, the diagnostic efficacy of IC, NIC, and λ HU in the PP was the best among the three phases (AP, PP, and DP), with a sensitivity up to 81.9%, 83.9%, and 81.8%, and a specificity up to 82.4%, 84.1% and 84.1%, respectively. The diagnostic value of combined analyses of MSAD with IC, NIC, or λ HU in the PP was superior to the dual energy CT parameters alone, with a sensitivity up to 84.5%, 86.9%, and 86.2%, and a specificity up to 83.0%, 93.6% and 89.8%, respectively. Between groups P1 and P2 and groups N1 and N2, only IC, NIC, and λ HU between groups N1 and N2 in the PP had a statistically significant difference (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION Dual-energy CT contributes beneficially to regional lymph node assessment in HCC patients. Combination of MSAD with IC, NIC, or λ HU values in the PP is superior to using any single parameter alone. Active hepatitis does not deteriorate the capabilities for characterization of metastatic lymph nodes.","Zeng, Yu-Rong; Yang, Qi-Hua; Liu, Qing-Yu; Min, Jun; Li, Hai-Gang; Liu, Zhi-Feng; Li, Ji-Xin",World journal of gastroenterology,18,19

Our aim was to determine the lifetime health and cost consequences of the quality of reperfusion for patients, healthcare systems, and society. Methods- A Markov model estimated lifetime quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and lifetime costs of endovascular thrombectomy-treated patients with stroke based on eTICI grades. The analysis was performed over a lifetime horizon in a United States setting, adopting healthcare and societal perspectives. The reference case analysis was conducted for stroke at 65 years of age. National health and cost consequences of improved eTICI 2c/3 reperfusion rates were estimated. Input parameters were based on best available evidence. Results- Lifetime QALYs increased for every grade of improved reperfusion (median QALYs for eTICI 0/1: 2.62; eTICI 2a: 3.46; eTICI 2b: 5.42; eTICI 2c: 5.99; eTICI 3: 6.73). Achieving eTICI 3 over eTICI 2b reperfusion resulted on average in 1.31 incremental QALYs as well as healthcare and societal cost savings of $10 327 and $20 224 per patient. A 10% increase in the eTICI 2c/3 reperfusion rate of all annually endovascular thrombectomy-treated patients with stroke in the United States is estimated to yield additional 3656 QALYs and save $21.0 million and $36.8 million for the healthcare system and society, respectively. Conclusions- Improved reperfusion grants patients with stroke additional QALYs and leads to long-term cost savings. Procedural strategies to achieve complete reperfusion should be assessed for safety and feasibility, even when initial reperfusion seems to be adequate.","Kunz, Wolfgang G; Almekhlafi, Mohammed A; Menon, Bijoy K; Saver, Jeffrey L; Hunink, Myriam G; Dippel, Diederik W J; Majoie, Charles B L M; Liebeskind, David S; Jovin, Tudor G; Davalos, Antoni; Bracard, Serge; Guillemin, Francis; Campbell, Bruce C V; Mitchell, Peter J; White, Philip; Muir, Keith W; Brown, Scott; Demchuk, Andrew M; Hill, Michael D; Goyal, Mayank",Stroke,18,20

A seed region analysis revealed consistent ipsilateral functional connections of the FEF with fronto-parietal cortical areas across both species. These included the intraparietal sulcus, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and supplementary eye fields. The analysis also revealed greater lateralization of connectivity with the FEF in both hemispheres in humans than in monkeys. Cortical surface-based transformation of connectivity maps between species further corroborated the remarkably similar organization of the FEF functional connectivity.

Methods A total of 158 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to three designated hospitals between December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2020 were retrospectively collected. 27 clinical and laboratory variables of COVID-19 patients were collected from the medical records. A total of 201 quantitative CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia were extracted by using an artificial intelligence software. The critically ill cases were defined according to the COVID-19 guidelines. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression was used to select the predictors of critical illness from clinical and radiological features, respectively. Accordingly, we developed clinical and radiological models using the following machine learning classifiers, including naive bayes (NB), linear regression (LR), random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), kernel support vector machine (k-SVM), and back propagation neural networks (BPNN). The combined model incorporating the selected clinical and radiological factors was also developed using the eight above-mentioned classifiers. The predictive efficiency of the models is validated using a 5-fold cross-validation method. The performance of the models was compared by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results The mean age of all patients was 58.9±13.9 years and 89 (56.3%) were males. 35 (22.2%) patients deteriorated to critical illness. After LASSO analysis, four clinical features including lymphocyte percentage, lactic dehydrogenase, neutrophil count, and D-dimer and four quantitative CT features were selected. The XGBoost-based clinical model yielded the highest AUC of 0.960 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.913-1.000)]. The XGBoost-based radiological model achieved an AUC of 0.890 (95% CI: 0.757-1.000). However, the predictive efficacy of XGBoost-based combined model was very close to that of the XGBoost-based clinical model, with an AUC of 0.955 (95% CI: 0.906-1.000). Conclusions A XGBoost-based based clinical model on admission might be used as an effective tool to identify patients at high risk of critical illness.","Liu, Qin; Pang, Baoguo; Li, Haijun; Zhang, Bin; Liu, Yumei; Lai, Lihua; Le, Wenjun; Li, Jianyu; Xia, Tingting; Zhang, Xiaoxian; Ou, Changxing; Ma, Jianjuan; Li, Shenghao; Guo, Xiumei; Zhang, Shuixing; Zhang, Qingling; Jiang, Min; Zeng, Qingsi",Journal of thoracic disease,18,20

The study also evaluated the potential anti-inflammatory effect of preoperative carbon dioxide-pneumoperitoneum (CO2P). MATERIALS AND METHODS Forty female Danish Landrace pigs were randomized to four groups: three intervention groups [open surgery ± prior CO2P and robot-assisted laparoscopic cystectomy (RALC)], all subjected to RC and an ileal conduit, and one control group. After euthanization, UEAs were harvested and histopathologically evaluated. RESULTS Five pigs were excluded from the study owing to postoperative complications. Operating room time and clamping of the right and left ureters were significantly longer in the robotic than in the open groups (p < .01). Inflammatory infiltration grade of the left ureter was significantly higher in RALC (p = .032). No statistically significant difference was observed between the open groups receiving prior CO2P or not. CONCLUSIONS Results showed a statistically significant higher inflammatory infiltration grade of the left ureter in RALC, emphasizing the importance of using meticulous techniques when mobilizing the left ureter using the robot. It was not possible to conclude with certainty whether CO2P could constitute an anti-inflammatory agent for local inflammation.","Kingo, Pernille Skjold; Rasmussen, Thormod Mønsted; Nørregaard, Rikke; Borre, Michael; Høyer, Søren; Jensen, Jørgen Bjerggaard",Scandinavian journal of urology,18,16

This study investigated the current status of HMV use in the Seoul metropolitan area. Methods This cross-sectional study involved three university-affiliated hospitals. Subjects who were receiving HMV at home for >3 months were included, and door-to-door visits were done to collect data (e.g., on devices, caregivers, and healthcare service use) from the subjects or their families. Results Among the 140 individuals who were initially screened, 38 adults and 26 children were finally enrolled; the duration of HMV use was 14.5 (8.8-37.5) months and 20.5 (7.0-28.0) months, respectively. Tracheostomy ventilation was performed in 36.8% of the adults and 61.5% of the children, and life-support ventilator in 55.3% and 96.2%, respectively. Regarding ancillary devices, 42.1% of the adults and 80.8% of the children had an oxygen monitoring device, while only one member of each group had a cough assist device. Among those with a tracheostomy, 64.3% of adults and 81.3% of children had an AMBU-bag. Reliance on a family member for care was determined in 65.8% of adults and 88.5% of children, but a home visit by a hospital nurse during the previous year occurred in only 26.3% of the adults and 3.8% of the children. Emergency incidents at home occurred in 39.5% of the adults and 50.0% of the children, with dyspnea being the most common cause. Out-of-pocket expenses tended to be higher in the tracheostomy (vs. non-tracheostomy) group and in children (vs. adults). Conclusions Our study highlights the challenges faced by adults and children dependent on HMV, and their families. There is an urgent need for nationwide standardization of care for patients receiving HMV at home.","Song, Kyunghyun; Kim, Sei-Won; Sim, Yun Su; Park, Tai Sun; Lee, Young Seok; Ha, Jick Hwan; Park, Ji Young; Jung, Ki-Suck; Park, Sunghoon",Journal of thoracic disease,18,1

De novo donor-specific antibodies (DSAs) to mismatched donor human leukocyte antigen after human lung transplantation predispose lung grafts to chronic rejection. We sought to delineate mediators and mechanisms of DSA pathogenesis and to define early inflammatory events that trigger chronic rejection in lung transplant recipients and obliterative airway disease, a correlate of human chronic rejection, in mouse. Induction of transcription factor zinc finger and BTB domain containing protein 7a (Zbtb7a) was an early response critical in the DSA-induced chronic rejection. A cohort of human lung transplant recipients who developed DSA and chronic rejection demonstrated greater Zbtb7a expression long before clinical diagnosis of chronic rejection compared to nonrejecting lung transplant recipients with stable pulmonary function. Expression of DSA-induced Zbtb7a was restricted to alveolar macrophages (AMs), and selective disruption of Zbtb7a in AMs resulted in less bronchiolar occlusion, low immune responses to lung-restricted self-antigens, and high protection from chronic rejection in mice. Additionally, in an allogeneic cell transfer protocol, antigen presentation by AMs was Zbtb7a-dependent where AMs deficient in Zbtb7a failed to induce antibody and T cell responses. Collectively, we demonstrate that AMs play an essential role in antibody-induced pathogenesis of chronic rejection by regulating early inflammation and lung-restricted humoral and cellular autoimmunity.","Nayak, Deepak K; Zhou, Fangyu; Xu, Min; Huang, Jing; Tsuji, Moriya; Yu, Jinsheng; Hachem, Ramsey; Gelman, Andrew E; Bremner, Ross M; Smith, Michael A; Mohanakumar, Thalachallour",Science translational medicine,18,17

OPCs isolated from non-ripe apple peel were tested for capacity to reduce dengue virus (DENV) titers. Similar to published accounts, OPCs exhibited direct antiviral activity. The possibility of enhanced innate immune protection was also tested by measuring and characterizing gene and protein expression induced by OPCs during DENV infection. Treatment of DENV-infected human PBMCs with OPCs decreased viral titers and affected the expression of critical innate antiviral immune products. OPCs enhanced expression of MXI and IFNB transcripts in high MOI DENV infected PBMC cultures, and phosphorylation of STAT2 in response to recombinant type I IFN (IFN I). During low MOI infection, addition of OPCs increased expression of STAT1 transcripts, MHC I and TNFα protein production. Thus, OPCs exhibited innate immune stimulation of cells in DENV-infected cultures and uninfected cells treated with IFN I. While OPCs from a number of sources are known to exhibit antiviral effects, their mechanisms are not precisely defined. The capacity of OPCs to increase sensitivity to IFN I could be broadly applicable to many viral infections and two separate antiviral mechanisms suggest that OPCs may represent a novel, robust antiviral therapy.","Kimmel, Emily M; Jerome, Maria; Holderness, Jeff; Snyder, Deann; Kemoli, Sharon; Jutila, Mark A; Hedges, Jodi F",Antiviral research,18,5

Recent studies showing the effectiveness and safety of mechanical thrombectomy combine modified TICI 2b and modified TICI 3 to assess the technical success of endovascular treatment. The purpose of this study was to determine how much clinical outcomes differ between patients achieving modified TICI 2b and modified TICI 3 reperfusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS We analyzed 222 consecutive patients with acute large intracranial artery occlusion of the anterior circulation having achieved modified TICI 2b or modified TICI 3 reperfusion after thrombectomy. The primary end point was the rate of favorable outcome defined as the achievement of a modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2 at 3 months. RESULTS Patients with modified TICI 3 more often had favorable collateral circulation and atherosclerosis etiology, with a shorter time from onset to reperfusion than patients with modified TICI 2b (all P < .05). The number of total passes to achieve reperfusion was higher in the modified TICI 2b group (median, 2; interquartile range, 1-3, 1-9) versus (median, 1; interquartile range, 1-2, 1-8) in the modified TICI 3 group (P = .0002). Favorable outcome was reached more often for patients with modified TICI 3 than for those with modified TICI 2b (71.7% versus 50.5%, P = .001), with a similar difference when considering excellent outcome. In addition, patients with modified TICI 3 had a lower intracerebral hemorrhage rate (23.0% versus 45.0%, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS Patients with modified TICI 3 reperfusion have better functional outcomes than those with modified TICI 2b. Given the improving reperfusion rates obtained with thrombectomy devices, future thrombectomy trials should consider modified TICI 2b and modified TICI 3 status separately.","Dargazanli, C; Consoli, A; Barral, M; Labreuche, J; Redjem, H; Ciccio, G; Smajda, S; Desilles, J P; Taylor, G; Preda, C; Coskun, O; Rodesch, G; Piotin, M; Blanc, R; Lapergue, B",AJNR.

Neurotrauma/traumatic brain injury (TBI) can cause activation of glial cells, neurons, and neuroimmune cells in the brain to release neuroinflammatory mediators. Neurotrauma leads to immediate primary brain damage (direct damage), neuroinflammatory responses, neuroinflammation, and late secondary brain damage (indirect) through neuroinflammatory mechanism. Secondary brain damage leads to chronic inflammation and the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Currently, there are no effective and specific therapeutic options to treat these brain damages or neurodegenerative diseases. Flavone luteolin is an important natural polyphenol present in several plants that show anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer, cytoprotective, and macrophage polarization effects. In this short review article, we have reviewed the neuroprotective effects of luteolin in neurotrauma and neurodegenerative disorders and pathways involved in this mechanism. We have collected data for this study from publications in the PubMed using the keywords luteolin and mast cells, neuroinflammation, neurodegenerative diseases, and TBI. Recent reports suggest that luteolin suppresses systemic and neuroinflammatory responses in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Studies have shown that luteolin exhibits neuroprotective effects through various mechanisms, including suppressing immune cell activation, such as mast cells, and inflammatory mediators released from these cells. In addition, luteolin can suppress neuroinflammatory response, activation of microglia and astrocytes, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and the severity of neuroinflammatory diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and TBI pathogenesis. In conclusion, luteolin can improve cognitive decline and enhance neuroprotection in neurodegenerative diseases, TBI, and stroke.","Kempuraj, Duraisamy; Thangavel, Ramasamy; Kempuraj, Deepak D; Ahmed, Mohammad Ejaz; Selvakumar, Govindhasamy Pushpavathi; Raikwar, Sudhanshu P; Zaheer, Smita A; Iyer, Shankar S; Govindarajan, Raghav; Chandrasekaran, Premkumar Nattanmai; Zaheer, Asgar",BioFactors,18,31

This study aimed to compare the three main SBS-models published. METHODS A 75%, 90%, or 100% mid-intestinal resection was performed in groups of n = 5 pigs each. Clinical (body weight, stool consistency) and biochemical (serum eletrolytes, citrulline, albumin, prealbumin, and transferrin) parameters were determined daily, functional (D-xylose resorption) and histological (intestinal villus length) parameters were determined after 2 weeks. A t-test and ANOVA were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS Only in the 100% group, we observed a persistent weight loss (13.6 ± 3.8%) and diarrhea, as well as a decrease in prealbumin-levels (41%) and transferrin levels (33%). Serum electrolytes remained stable in all groups during the observation period. Citrulline stabilized at different levels (100% group 13.9 ± 1.0 μmol/L; 90% group 18.8 ± 1.0 μmol/L; 75% group 26.3 ± 1.4 μmol/L; all p < .05). D-xylose resorption was lowest in the 100%, followed by 90% and 75% group (100% group 32.8 ± 4.9 mg/L; 90% group 50.0 ± 19.6 mg/L; 75% group 57.8 ± 8.8 mg/L; p = .393). Intestinal villus length decreased in all groups (100% group 11.0%; 90% group 14.0%; 75% group 19.1%). CONCLUSIONS 75% intestinal resection is less suitable as an SBS model, as animals tend to recover remarkably. The 90% model is suitable for longer-term studies, as animals might survive longer due to partial compensation. Due to severe nutritional, biochemical, and physiological derangements, the 100% model can only be used for acute experiments and those immediately followed by small bowel transplantation.","Frongia, Giovanni; Nickkholgh, Arash; Hafezi M, Mohammad Reza; Arvin, Jalal; Saffari, Arash; Golriz, Mohammad; Aydin, Esvad; Weih, Sandra; Kessler, Markus; Emami, Golnaz; Garoussi, Camelia; Okun, Jürgen G; Schmidt, Kathrin; Thiel, Christian; Brune, Maik; Günther, Patrick; Holland-Cunz, Stefan; Mehrabi, Arianeb",Journal of investigative surgery : the official journal of the Academy of Surgical Research,18,1

For this, good coverage analgesia is essential. Epidural anesthesia, a standard technique for thoracic surgery, has high risk of complications, such as epidural abscess and spinal hematoma in open-heart surgery. Based on the hypothesis that continuous paravertebral block (CPVB), a less invasive regional anesthetic technique, is safe and effective in open-heart surgery, we applied CPVB to MICS with thoracotomy. Findings To assess whether CPVB could be used in open-heart surgery with fewer potential complications, we investigated our medical records of the 87 adult patients who underwent MICS at Akashi Medical Center, Hyogo, Japan, between March 2009 and May 2016. We collected data of CPVB-related complications, postextubation respiratory failure, duration of intubation, and other analgesic use from hospital clinical records. We observed no severe CPVB-related complications, such as hematoma, neuropathy, or abscess. PT-INR longer than 1.1 was associated with CPVB-related minor bleeding. Forty-three patients (47.4%) were extubated within 1 h after surgery, and there were no postextubation respiratory failures in any patients. Conclusions We observed no cases of severe CPVB-related complications or postextubation respiratory failure in any of our patients who underwent MICS.

Here, we intend to review this field from a global perspective by considering and linking the two sides of the problem. In the first part, we present the theoretical model used to study interfacial flows arising in droplet-based microfluidics, paying attention to three elements commonly present in applications: viscoelasticity, electric fields and surfactants. We review both classical and current results about the stability of jets affected by these elements. Mechanisms leading to the breakup of jets to produce drops are reviewed as well, including some recent advances in this field. We also consider the relatively scarce theoretical studies on the emergence and stability of tip streaming flows. In the second part of this review, we focus on axisymmetric microfluidic configurations which can operate on the dripping and jetting modes either in a direct (standard) way or via tip streaming. We present the dimensionless parameters characterizing these configurations, the scaling laws which allow predicting the size of the resulting droplets and bubbles, as well as those delimiting the parameter windows where tip streaming can be found. Special attention is paid to electrospray and flow focusing, two of the techniques more frequently used in continuous drop production microfluidics. We aim to connect experimental observations described in this section of topics with fundamental and general aspects described in the first part of the review.

These strokes are treatable by intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator and endovascular methods. However, dynamics of infarct growth in these strokes are poorly documented. The purpose was to help understand infarct growth dynamics by measuring acute infarct size with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) at known times after stroke onset in patients with documented internal carotid artery/middle cerebral artery occlusions. METHODS Retrospectively, we included 47 consecutive patients with documented internal carotid artery/middle cerebral artery occlusions who underwent DWI within 30 hours of stroke onset. Prospectively, 139 patients were identified using the same inclusion criteria. DWI lesion volumes were measured and correlated to time since stroke onset. Perfusion data were reviewed in those who underwent perfusion imaging. RESULTS Acute infarct volumes ranged from 0.41 to 318.3 mL. Infarct size and time did not correlate (R2=0.001). The majority of patients had DWI lesions that were <25% the territory at risk (<70 mL) whether they were imaged <8 or >8 hours after stroke onset. DWI lesions corresponded to areas of greatly reduced perfusion. CONCLUSIONS Poor correlation between infarct volume and time after stroke onset suggests that there are factors more powerful than time in determining infarct size within the first 30 hours. The observations suggest that highly variable cerebral perfusion via the collateral circulation may primarily determine infarct growth dynamics. If verified, clinical implications include the possibility of treating many patients outside traditional time windows.","Hakimelahi, Reza; Vachha, Behroze A; Copen, William A; Papini, Giacomo D E; He, Julian; Higazi, Mahmoud M; Lev, Michael H; Schaefer, Pamela W; Yoo, Albert J; Schwamm, Lee H; González, R Gilberto",Stroke,18,1

As a consequence of the new circumstances, almost all endoscopic units underwent in-depth reorganization involving patients' selection. We analyzed the efficacy of the newly adopted endoscopic triage. METHODS In March 2020, we monitored endoscopies to evaluate the effects of the novel selective triage aimed to reduce the number of investigations and viral spread/contagions. Clinical-demographic data of the patients, indications, type of endoscopy, endoscopic findings (subtyped in major and minor), finding rates (major and minor) and diagnostic yields (major findings) have been analyzed and compared to the endoscopic procedures performed in March 2019. Furthermore, patients were called at least 21 days after the endoscopy to evaluate the possibility of a Covid-19 onset. RESULTS Accordingly to the novel triage, the number of procedures dropped from 530 to 91 (-84%). The finding rates and diagnostic yields were 83% (74-89) vs 71% (66-73) (P 0.015) and 56% (46-65) vs 43% (38-47) (P 0.03) on March 2020 and March 2019, respectively. A significant increase of operative procedures has been reported in 2020, 34% vs 22% in March 2019. All the patients were recalled and neither cases of onset of Covid-19 like symptoms nor positive nasopharyngeal swabs PCR have been evidenced. CONCLUSION The novel endoscopic triage significantly reduced the number of procedures and increased finding rates and diagnostic yields. However, a careful schedule of canceled procedures should be applied to avoid to miss relevant pathologies. No Covid-19 onset or infection has been noted after endoscopies.","Elli, Luca; Tontini, Gian Eugenio; Filippi, Elisabetta; Scaramella, Lucia; Cantù, Paolo; Vecchi, Maurizio; Bertè, Roberto; Baldassarri, Annarita; Penagini, Roberto",European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology,18,1

This article describes the unexpected impact that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had on community-based specialty practices across the United States, especially oncology practices. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS We conducted an electronic national survey of community-based specialty practice administrators to determine the impact of COVID-19 on their practices and their ability to manage through a global pandemic. The 22-question survey focused on an initial observation period of March 15, 2020, to May 15, 2020, compared with a second period of May 16, 2020, to August 15, 2020. RESULTS Oncology practices accounted for 46% of the 155 specialty practices that participated in the survey. Overall, 57% of respondents saw at least a 30% decline in total patient volume and/or financial impact during the initial observation period, compared with a 38% decline for the oncology practices. More than 70% of all practices experienced improvement after May 15, 2020, with at least 60% improving regardless of specialty. The initial decline was primarily driven by declines in new patient volume and procedures. Approximately 62% of practices anticipate a moderate-to-significant impact on patient outcomes over the next 12 months. The impact expected was slightly higher in retina and ophthalmology practices than oncology. CONCLUSIONS Although unexpectedly impacted in delivering care for their patients, specialty practices generally and oncology practices especially have been resilient by leveraging federal funds and adopting operational enhancements.","Gordan, Lucio N; Weidner, Susan",The American journal of managed care,18,12

Do genetic thrombophilic states, strongly associated with venous thrombosis, independently cause arterial events in adults? Should cases of patent foramen ovale be closed with mechanical devices in patients with cryptogenic stroke? What are the optimal treatments for cerebral vein thrombosis, carotid artery dissection, and antiphospholipid syndrome and are DOACs acceptable treatment for these indications? What is the mechanism underlying large vessel stroke in patients with COVID-19? This is a narrative review. We searched PubMed and Embase and American College of physicians Journal club database for English language articles since 2000 looking mainly at randomized clinical trials, Meta analyses, Cochran reviews as well as some research articles viewed to be cutting edge regarding anticoagulation and cerebrovascular disease.

The mechanism of relapse post-CART therapy is under vigorous research. We report a 9-year-old boy who received CD19-CART therapy after BM ALL relapse post-HSCT. He presented with unilateral eye swelling which was initially managed as orbital cellulitis. Later on, it was proven to be an isolated ALL orbital relapse without peripheral blood B-cell detection or BM involvement. Despite radiotherapy, he subsequently developed refractory CD19 positive ALL BM relapse. This case highlights the possibility of unusual relapse sites after CART-therapy and that regular peripheral B-cell monitoring is not enough to assure remission status. Better monitoring tools are needed to detect early disease relapse. Further understanding of the pathophysiology of isolated extramedullary relapse post-CART therapy is warranted to improve the management of such challenging presentations.","Essa, Mohammed F; Alsultan, Abdulrahman",Pediatric transplantation,18,1

METHODS From November 2014 to November 2015, COPD patients were enrolled from Beijing Chao-yang Hospital, and the the biological and clinical data were collected. These patients were tested in the non-acute exacerbation period and the acute exacerbation period, so they were defined as AECOPD group and Non-AECOPD group. Besides, 50 healthy subjects were recruited and defined as control group. Total plasma Hcy levels (antibodies-online, USA) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlation between serum Hcy level and ventilatory function. Using ROC curve, the diagnostic value of Hcy for the occurrence and acute progression of COPD was explored. RESULTS In this study, we found that Hcy levels in the Non-AECOPD group or the AECOPD group were significantly higher than those in the control group (P < 0.001). Meanwhile, compared with the Non-AECOPD group, the Hcy level in the AECOPD group was significantly higher (P < 0.001). In addition, according to the classification of GOLD grade, there was significant difference in the Hcy level among different GOLD grade groups (P < 0.001). The correlation analysis showed that in the AECOPD group and the Non-AECOPD group, Hcy levels presented a negative correlation with FEV1(r < 0). Meanwhile, FEV1% was also negatively correlated with Hcy level (r < 0). ROC curve analysis showed that when the cutoff value was set to 10.8 μg/ml, the specificity, sensitivity and AUC were the best, which were 0.980, 0.800, and 0.945, respectively. Besides, our results showed that when the cutoff value was set to 14.0 μg / ml, the specificity, sensitivity and AUC were the best, which were 0.846, 0.680, and 0.802, respectively. In addition, compared with the prediction of acute progression of COPD, when Hcy level predicted the occurrence of COPD, its specificity (0.980 vs. 0.846, P < 0.001) and sensitivity (0.800 vs. 0.680, P < 0.001) were significantly higher. CONCLUSION Hcy level is positively correlated with the severity of COPD patients, which has predictive value for the occurrence of COPD and acute progression.","Wei, Bing; Tian, Tian; Liu, Yugeng; Li, Chunsheng",BMC pulmonary medicine,18,17

OBJECTIVES To estimate the prevalence of cutaneous manifestations in COVID-19 patients. METHODS This study was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. A detailed literature search was done in PubMed and Embase from December 1, 2019, till May 1, 2020. Studies reporting cutaneous manifestations in COVID-19 patients were included. Irrespective of the heterogeneity of data, a random effects model with inverse-variance approach was used for pooling the prevalence using meta package in R version 3.6.2. RESULTS Out of 15,143 articles, 2086 articles were selected for full-text read. Forty-three articles were selected for qualitative analysis, of which 10 articles (N = 1682) were included for meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of overall cutaneous lesions was 5.69 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.87-15.98; I2 88%). The pooled prevalence of other outcome parameters were as follows: viral exanthem-like presentation 4.15 (95% CI: 1.33-12.23; I2 88%), maculopapular rash 3.81 (95% CI: 1.02-13.18; I2 87%), vesiculobullous lesions 1.67 (95% CI: 0.70-3.96; I2 0%). CONCLUSION The estimated prevalence of cutaneous manifestations in COVID-19 was 5.69%. Other manifestations were urticaria, chilblain-like lesions, livedo reticularis, and finger/toe gangrene. Although it is premature to conclude the prevalence of the cutaneous manifestations during this ongoing pandemic, our report may be a stimulating factor for the physicians to perform further vigilant streamlined reporting of cutaneous manifestations in COVID-19 patients to estimate the final prevalence.","Bandhala Rajan, M; Kumar-M, Praveen; Bhardwaj, Abhishek",International journal of dermatology,18,1

To date, handling large amounts of data from NGS requires the expertise of bioinformaticians, both for data processing and result analysis. Consequently, VVV was designed to help non-bioinformaticians to perform these tasks. By providing only the NGS data file, the developed pipeline generated consensus sequences and determined the composition of the viral population for an avian Metapneumovirus (AMPV) and three different animal coronaviruses (Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDV), Turkey Coronavirus (TCoV) and Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV)). In all cases, the pipeline produced viral consensus genomes corresponding to known consensus sequence and made it possible to highlight the presence of viral genetic variants through a single graphic representation. The method was validated by comparing the viral populations of an AMPV field sample, and of a copy of this virus produced from a DNA clone. VVV demonstrated that the cloned virus population was homogeneous (as designed) at position 2934 where the wild-type virus demonstrated two variant populations at a ratio of almost 50:50. A total of 18, 10, 3 and 28, viral genetic variants were detected for AMPV, PEDV, TCoV and IBV respectively. The simplicity of this pipeline makes the study of viral genetic variants more accessible to a wide variety of biologists, which should ultimately increase the rate of understanding of the mechanisms of viral genetic evolution.","Flageul, Alexandre; Lucas, Pierrick; Hirchaud, Edouard; Touzain, Fabrice; Blanchard, Yannick; Eterradossi, Nicolas; Brown, Paul; Grasland, Béatrice",Virus research,18,16

However, whether the physical impairments related to TL translate to a reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL) has not yet been determined. Therefore, the objective of this systematic review was to determine how HRQoL is affected following TL. METHODS Systematic searches were conducted in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane. Inclusion criteria were original studies describing quality of life following TL after larynx/hypopharynx cancer using a formally developed patient-reported questionnaire. Study quality assessment was carried out with the tool developed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. RESULTS Forty-six studies using 12 different questionnaires were included. The majority were cross-sectional (85%), and study quality was rated poor in 30%, fair in 30%, and good in 39% of studies. When comparing results from the four most frequently used questionnaires with normative data, we found that in more than 60% of studies, differences to the reference population were of clinical importance, with only few exceptions. CONCLUSIONS In general, we found that people who received TL have a worse HRQoL than the male normative reference population. However, even though TL patients experience a clinically important difference in many domains when compared with normative data, their burden of symptoms is generally mild. The current review also makes it evident that despite the relatively large number of studies conducted, the strength of evidence remains weak.

We used boosted regression trees (an advanced form of regression analysis based on machine learning) to model relationships between responses to the questionnaires and decision-making tasks. Results showed that the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic predicted participants' responses to the framing problems and utilitarian/deontological and altruistic/egoistic moral dilemmas (but not to the dictator game). More concretely, the more psychological impact participants suffered, the more they were willing to choose the safest response in the framing problems, and the more deontological/altruistic were their responses to moral dilemmas.

Provision of PMDs is complex, with cognitive functioning expressed by clinicians as a major concern. Even if PMD use can be predicted by the level of cognitive functioning, outcome tools used to assess readiness do not consider how cognitive functioning may affect PMD use. OBJECTIVE The specific aims of this review are to identify existing assessments used to assess cognitive functioning and PMD use, classify cognitive functions that are identified within existing assessments related to PMD use, and explore the relationships between cognitive functioning (ie, executive functions and attention) and PMD use. METHODS A systematic review will be conducted using the electronic databases MEDLINE (Ovid), CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO (Ovid), and Web of Science based on the concepts of PMD performance and capacity, and cognitive functioning. To be included, studies must have: a sample of PMD users (inclusive of age and diagnoses), an assessment of cognitive functioning, and an assessment of PMD capacity or performance. The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health will be used to classify cognitive functions. Study quality will be assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Qualitative and quantitative studies will be analyzed in a complementary manner depending on their designs; a result-based convergent synthesis design will be applied. RESULTS This proposed systematic review protocol has been registered in PROSPERO (CRD42019118957). It was funded by the Quebec Rehabilitation Research Network and approved on February 2019.

The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and clinical characteristics of potential DR-related variants in Chinese CHB patients not receiving nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs). Patients and Methods Two hundred and six untreated CHB patients from Huzhou Central Hospital in eastern China were recruited for this study. The serum DNA was extracted and the HBV RT region was amplified using nest polymerase chain reaction (nest-PCR). The 42 potential DR-related variants were analyzed by direct sequencing. Results Among these CHB patients, HBV genotype B and genotype C were identified in 121 (58.7%) and 85 (41.3%) patients, respectively. Potential DR-related variants were detected in 42.7% (88/206) of patients. Primary and secondary DR variants were found in 7.3% (15/206) of patients, including rtL80I/V, rtI169T, rtV173L rtL180M, rtA181T/V, rtM204I/V, and rtN236T. The variants at rt53, rt82, rt221, rt233, rt237, and rt256 were specific for genotype B, and those at rt38, rt84, rt126, rt139, rt153, rt191, rt214, rt238, and rt242 were specific for genotype C. Moreover, the variation frequency in the A-B interdomain (3.96%) was significantly higher than that in the functional domains (1.17%) and non-A-B interdomains (1.11%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that lower HBV-DNA load (<106 IU/mL) was an independent factor associated with potential DR-related variants in untreated CHB patients (P <0.05). Conclusion Potential DR-related variants were frequent and complex in untreated Chinese CHB patients. Furthermore, the variants may contribute to decreased serum HBV-DNA loads. However, the effects of potential DR-related variants on the antiviral therapy and liver disease progression require further study.","Qian, Fuchu; Zou, Weihua; Jin, Fang; Li, Dongli; Shen, Yujuan",Infection and drug resistance,18,1

Antigen tests have received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for use in asymptomatic and symptomatic persons within the first 5-12 days after symptom onset (2). These tests have been used at U.S. colleges and universities and other congregate settings (e.g., nursing homes and correctional and detention facilities), where serial testing of asymptomatic persons might facilitate early case identification (3-5). However, test performance data from symptomatic and asymptomatic persons are limited. This investigation evaluated performance of the Sofia SARS Antigen Fluorescent Immunoassay (FIA) (Quidel Corporation) compared with real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 detection among asymptomatic and symptomatic persons at two universities in Wisconsin. During September 28-October 9, a total of 1,098 paired nasal swabs were tested using the Sofia SARS Antigen FIA and real-time RT-PCR. Virus culture was attempted on all antigen-positive or real-time RT-PCR-positive specimens. Among 871 (79%) paired swabs from asymptomatic participants, the antigen test sensitivity was 41.2%, specificity was 98.4%, and in this population the estimated positive predictive value (PPV) was 33.3%, and negative predictive value (NPV) was 98.8%. Antigen test performance was improved among 227 (21%) paired swabs from participants who reported one or more symptoms at specimen collection (sensitivity = 80.0%; specificity = 98.9%; PPV = 94.1%; NPV = 95.9%). Virus was isolated from 34 (46.6%) of 73 antigen-positive or real-time RT-PCR-positive nasal swab specimens, including two of 18 that were antigen-negative and real-time RT-PCR-positive (false-negatives). The advantages of antigen tests such as low cost and rapid turnaround might allow for rapid identification of infectious persons. However, these advantages need to be balanced against lower sensitivity and lower PPV, especially among asymptomatic persons. Confirmatory testing with an FDA-authorized nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), such as RT-PCR, should be considered after negative antigen test results in symptomatic persons, and after positive antigen test results in asymptomatic persons (1).","Pray, Ian W; Ford, Laura; Cole, Devlin; Lee, Christine; Bigouette, John Paul; Abedi, Glen R; Bushman, Dena; Delahoy, Miranda J; Currie, Dustin; Cherney, Blake; Kirby, Marie; Fajardo, Geroncio; Caudill, Motria; Langolf, Kimberly; Kahrs, Juliana; Kelly, Patrick; Pitts, Collin; Lim, Ailam; Aulik, Nicole; Tamin, Azaibi; Harcourt, Jennifer L; Queen, Krista; Zhang, Jing; Whitaker, Brett; Browne, Hannah; Medrzycki, Magdalena; Shewmaker, Patricia; Folster, Jennifer; Bankamp, Bettina; Bowen, Michael D; Thornburg, Natalie J; Goffard, Kimberly; Limbago, Brandi; Bateman, Allen; Tate, Jacqueline E; Gieryn, Douglas; Kirking, Hannah L; Westergaard, Ryan; Killerby, Marie",MMWR.

Surgical treatment is further complicated by coexisting gastro-oesophageal reflux. No universal surgical strategy exists for this problem. METHODS A novel surgical strategy combines partial sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and hiatus hernia (HH) repair with fundoplication. A review of treating four such patients is described with objective outcome data. RESULTS Overall, solid gastric emptying improved in all, from median 350 (163-488) min pre-operatively to 108 (84-135) at 10 months (3-24) post-operatively, corresponding to 67% improvement. Primary symptoms resolved in all; however, one patient had recurrent symptoms. GERD-HRQL also improved in all, from median 23 (3-25) to 4 (0-8) at 21 months (6-30, 83% improvement). Gas bloat improved in three. All had post-operative gastroscopies showing intact repair and absent oesophagitis, with no patient requiring post-operative PPI. Patient weight reduced by median 11% (7-20) post-operatively. There was no significant peri-operative morbidity.

We aim to systematically explore the association of vitamin D serum levels with COVID-19 severity and prognosis. METHODS The standardized mean difference (SMD) or odds ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI) were applied to estimate pooled results from seven studies. The prognostic performance of vitamin D serum levels for predicting adverse outcomes with detection of the best cutoff threshold was determined by ROC curve analysis. Decision tree analysis by combining vitamin D levels and clinical features was applied to predict severity in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS Mean vitamin D serum level of 1,368 patients, was 22.9 nmol/L (21.9-23.8). Significant heterogeneity was found (I2 = 99.9%, P< 0.001). Patients with poor prognosis (N=634) had significantly lower serum levels of vitamin D compared to those with good prognosis (N=669), representing an adjusted standardized mean difference of -5.12 (95% Cl= -9.14 to -1.10, P = 0.012). CONCLUSION Serum vitamin D levels could be implicated in the COVID-19 prognosis.

Amino and hydroxy groups (similar to those which have been previously synthesized) are introduced and their effect on excited state energies and charge transfer is assessed. Analogous to formally oxidized alkoxyamines, the charge-separated nNπ* state can undergo mesolytic cleavage or bimolecular or SN2 reactions with nucleophiles, according to the substitution patterns and other reagents present. While homolytic cleavage is in principle promoted by triplet ππ* states, the accessible ππ* triplet states in this system are centered on the chromophore and unreactive. We show that the reactive nNπ* state, which bears a negative charge, is stabilized by hydroxy substitution while amino substitution will destabilize it. After mesolysis to a carbon centred radical, the nitroxide radical re-forms; however, when carbocations are produced the remaining open-shell singlet is stable and unable to undergo coupling with the carbocation.","Hill, Nicholas S; Coote, Michelle L",Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,18,16

At 1-year follow-up, these results were similar. CONCLUSIONS Bivalirudin can be safely and effectively used during PPCI in older patients with STEMI. Bivalirudin reduces the risks of NACEs and bleeding within 30 days after PPCI, without increasing the risks of MACCEs and stent thrombosis compared with heparin.","Chen, Hongwu; Yu, Xiaofan; Kong, Xiangyong; Li, Longwei; Wu, Jiawei; Ma, Likun",The Journal of international medical research,18,17

In 2019, the early winter influenza season coincided with mid-year school breaks, enabling us the unusual opportunity to examine how influenza incidence changed during school closure dates. Methods: The weekly influenza data from five Australian state and one territory health departments for the period of week 19 (mid-May) to week 35 (early September) 2019 were compared to each state's public school closure dates. We used segmented regression to model the weekly counts and a negative binomial distribution to account for overdispersion due to autocorrelation. The models' goodness-of-fit was assessed by plots of observed versus expected counts, plots of residuals versus predicted values, and Pearson's Chi-square test. The main exposure was the July two-week school vacation period, using a lag of one week. The effect is estimated as a percent change in incidence level, and in slope. We also dichotomized the change in weekly counts into decreases versus increases (or no change). The proportion of decreases were then compared for each of three periods (pre-vacation, vacation, post-vacation) using Fishers exact test. Results: School holidays were associated with significant declines in influenza incidence. The models showed acceptable goodness-of-fit. The numbers and percentages of decreases in weekly influenza counts from the previous week for all states combined were: 19 (33%) pre-vacation; 11 (92%) decreases during the vacation; and 19 (59%) decreases post-vacation (P=0.0002). The first decline during school holidays is seen in the school aged (5-19 years) population, with the declines in the adult and infant populations being smaller and following a week later. Conclusions: Given the significant and rapid reductions in incidence, these results have important public health implications. Closure or extension of holiday periods could be an emergency option for state governments.","Scott, Anna Mae; Bakhit, Mina; Clark, Justin; Vermeulen, Melanie; Jones, Mark; Looke, David; Del Mar, Chris; Glasziou, Paul",F1000Research,18,28

In this time of crisis and urgency, the only hope comes from new candidate vaccines and potential antivirals. However, formulating new vaccines and synthesizing new antivirals is a laborious task. Therefore, considering the high infection rate and mortality due to COVID-19, utilization of previous information, and repurposing of existing drugs against valid viral targets has emerged as a novel drug discovery approach in this challenging time. The transmembrane spike (S) glycoprotein of coronaviruses (CoVs) which facilitates virus entry into the host cells, exists as homotrimeric form and is covered with N-linked glycans. S glycoprotein is known as the main target of antibodies having neutralizing potency and is also considered as an attractive target for therapeutic or vaccine development. Similarly, targeting of N-linked glycans of S glycoprotein envelop of CoV via carbohydrate-binding agents (CBAs) could serve as an attractive therapeutic approach for developing novel antivirals. CBAs from natural sources like lectins from plants, marine algae and prokaryotes and lectin mimics like Pradimicin-A (PRM-A) have shown antiviral activities against CoV and other enveloped viruses. However, the potential use of CBAs specifically lectins was limited due to unfavorable responses like immunogenicity, mitogenicity, hemagglutination, inflammatory activity, cellular toxicity, etc. Here, we have reviewed the current scenario of CBAs as antivirals against CoVs, presented strategies to improve the efficacy of CBAs against CoVs; and studied the molecular interactions between CBAs (lectins and PRM-A) with Man9 by molecular docking for potential repurposing against CoVs in general and the SARS-CoV-2 in particular.","Gupta, Rajesh Kumar; Apte, Girish R; Lokhande, Kiran Bharat; Mishra, Satyendra; Pal, Jayanta K",Current protein & peptide science,18,1

Twenty-one dogs undergoing prophylactic laparoscopic gastropexy with a simple continuous barbed suture without incising the seromuscular layer of the stomach and transversus abdominis muscle were reviewed. In 20 cases, additional procedures were performed (18 ovariectomies and 2 prescrotal castrations); 1 dog had two prior episodes of gastric dilation without volvulus and underwent gastropexy with a prophylactic intent. The gastropexy procedure had a median duration of 33 min (range 19-43 min). V-Loc 180 absorbable and the V-Loc PBT nonabsorbable suturing devices were used in 8 and 13 dogs, respectively. Minor intraoperative complications occurred in four cases: broken suture (1), needle dislodgement (2), and folded needle (1). Minor complications included self-limiting wound complications (3), abdominal discomfort (2), vomiting (1), and inappetence (2). Postoperative abdominal ultrasound performed after a median of 8 mo (6-36 mo) confirmed permanent adhesion at the gastropexy site in all dogs. One dog developed a fistula (1 yr postoperatively) and another a granuloma (3 mo postoperatively), both at the gastropexy site. Prophylactic laparoscopic gastropexy may be performed with knotless unidirectional barbed suture without creating an incision on the abdominal wall and stomach.","Deroy, Claire; Hahn, Harriet; Bismuth, Camille; Ragetly, Guillaume; Gomes, Eymeric; Poncet, Cyrill",Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association,18,1

METHODS This retrospective study examined prospectively collected data on 219 robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomies performed from May 2011 to February 2013. Patients were divided into four groups based on pathologic prostate weight: <30 g, 30-49 g, 50-79 g, and ≥80 g. Continence and sexual function were assessed using validated questionnaires. RESULTS Of the 219 patients, 19, 143, 51, and 6 had prostates weighing <30 g, 30-49 g, 50-79 g, and ≥80 g, respectively. Significant differences were found between the preoperative Gleason scores, total operative times, and robotic times of the groups. Both estimated blood loss and anastomosis time tended to be greater in the higher prostate weight groups, but the differences were not significant. No significant differences were observed in transfusion rate, length of catheterization, complication incidence, or positive surgical margins. The return of urinary function, as determined by questionnaire scores, was not affected by prostate weight. CONCLUSIONS Robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy can be performed safely and with similar perioperative outcomes, regardless of prostate weight. Indeed, oncological outcome, urinary continence, and complications were similar across the prostate weight groups, suggesting that robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy with a posterior approach to the seminal vesicle may be performed effectively on men with large prostates, despite greater surgical times.","Yasui, Takahiro; Tozawa, Keiichi; Kurokawa, Satoshi; Okada, Atsushi; Mizuno, Kentaro; Umemoto, Yukihiro; Kawai, Noriyasu; Sasaki, Shoichi; Hayashi, Yutaro; Kojima, Yoshiyuki; Kohri, Kenjiro",BMC urology,18,26

However, standardized analysis tools for IVPG quantification are missing. We aimed to evaluate the feasibility, the test-retest observer reproducibility, and the inter-system variability of a semi-automated IVPG quantification algorithm. The study included forty healthy volunteers (50% were men). All volunteers were examined using two ultrasound systems, the Philips Epiq 7 and the General Electric Vivid 6. Left ventricular diastolic (DIVPG) and systolic (SIVPG) intraventricular pressure gradients were measured from the spatiotemporal distribution of intraventricular propagation flow velocities using color Doppler M-mode in standard apical views. There was good feasibility for both systolic and diastolic IVPG measurements (82.5% and 85%, respectively). Intra and inter-observer test-retest variability measured with the intraclass correlation coefficient were 0.98 and 0.93 for DIVPG respectively, and 0.95 and 0.89 for SIVPG respectively. The inter-system concordance was weak to moderate with Lin's concordance correlation coefficient of 0.59 for DIVPG and 0.25 for SIVPG. In conclusion, it is feasible and reproducible to assess systolic and diastolic IVPG using color Doppler M-mode in healthy volunteers. However, the inter-system variability in IVPG analysis needs to be taken into account, especially when using displayed data.","Hodzic, Amir; Bonnefous, Odile; Langet, Hélène; Hamiche, Walid; Chaufourier, Laure; Tournoux, Francois; Milliez, Paul; Normand, Hervé; Saloux, Eric",Scientific reports,18,8

Reoperative MV surgery is most commonly performed via sternotomy (ST). We sought to determine whether minimally-invasive (MIS) reoperative MV surgery is safe and feasible. METHODS All patients with a history of ST undergoing MV surgery with or without concomitant tricuspid or atrial fibrillation surgery at a single institution from 2007 to 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. ST and MIS approaches were compared using propensity-matched analysis. The coprimary endpoints were operative mortality and 1-year survival, and secondary endpoints were operative complications and length of stay. RESULTS A total of 305 isolated MV reoperations were performed: 199 (65%) MIS and 106 (35%) ST. MIS patients were older than ST patients (71 [63, 76.5] vs. 66 [56, 72] years, p < .01), more likely to have undergone prior coronary artery bypass grafting (57% vs. 27%, p < .01), and less likely to have had prior valve surgery (55% vs. 78%, p < .01). In unmatched comparisons, operative mortality was significantly lower among MIS patients (3.0% vs. 8.5%, p = .04), but 1-year mortality was similar (14.4% vs. 15.6%, p = .8). After propensity matching, 88 pairs had excellent balance across baseline characteristics. Mortality was similar among MIS and ST patients at 30 days (3.4% vs. 8%, p = .19) and 1 year (15.9% vs. 16.5%, p = .9). RBC and fresh frozen plasma transfusions were significantly lower in the MIS group (p < .01).

We evaluated significant small bowel capsule endoscopy (SBCE) findings that can lead to early diagnosis of CD. METHODS We retrospectively accumulated clinical and SBCE data of 108 patients (63 with and 45 without CD). Types of small bowel mucosal injuries, including erosion, ulceration, and cobblestone appearance, and the alignment of diminutive lesions were compared between patients with and without CD. Inter- and intra-observer agreement in the determination of lesions was assessed in 25 pairs of SBCE from the two groups. RESULTS Under SBCE, cobblestone appearance (33% vs. 2%, p < 0.0001), longitudinal ulcers (78% vs. 20%, p < 0.0001), and irregular ulcers (84% vs. 60%, p < 0.01) were more frequently found in patients with CD. Linear erosion (90% vs. 38%, p < 0.0001) and irregular erosion (89% vs. 64%, p < 0.005) were also more frequent in patients with CD. Furthermore, circumferential (75% vs. 9%, p < 0.0001) and longitudinal (56% vs. 7%, p < 0.0001) alignment of diminutive lesions, mainly observed in the 1st tertile of the small bowel, was more frequent in patients with CD. Good intra-observer agreement was found for ulcers, cobblestone appearance, and lesion alignment. However, inter-observer agreement of SBCE findings differed among observers. CONCLUSIONS Circumferential or longitudinal alignment of diminutive lesions, especially in the upper small bowel, may be a diagnostic clue for CD under SBCE, while inter-observer variations should be cautiously considered when using SBCE.","Esaki, Motohiro; Matsumoto, Takayuki; Ohmiya, Naoki; Washio, Ema; Morishita, Toshifumi; Sakamoto, Kei; Abe, Hiroo; Yamamoto, Shojiro; Kinjo, Tetsu; Togashi, Kazutomo; Watanabe, Kenji; Hirai, Fumihito; Nakamura, Masanao; Nouda, Sadaharu; Ashizuka, Shinya; Omori, Teppei; Kochi, Shuji; Yanai, Shunichi; Fuyuno, Yuta; Hirano, Atsushi; Umeno, Junji; Kitazono, Takanari; Kinjo, Fukunori; Watanabe, Mamoru; Matsui, Toshiyuki; Suzuki, Yasuo",Journal of gastroenterology,18,12

Near-infrared spectroscopy can measure perioperative brain oxygenation [regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rScO2)]. AIMS To evaluate the effects of CO2 insufflation on rScO2 during thoracoscopic esophageal atresia (EA) repair. METHODS This is an observational study during thoracoscopic EA repair with 5 mmHg CO2 insufflation pressure. Mean arterial blood pressure (MABP), arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2), partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (paCO2), pH, and rScO2 were monitored in 15 neonates at seven time points: baseline (T0), after anesthesia induction (T1), after CO2-insufflation (T2), before CO2-exsufflation (T3), and postoperatively at 6 (T4), 12 (T5), and 24 h (T6). RESULTS MABP remained stable. SaO2 decreased from T0 to T2 [97 ± 3-90 ± 6 % (p < 0.01)]. PaCO2 increased from T0 to T2 [41 ± 6-54 ± 15 mmHg (p < 0.01)]. pH decreased from T0 to T2 [7.33 ± 0.04-7.25 ± 0.11 (p < 0.05)]. All parameters recovered during the surgical course. Mean rScO2 was significantly higher at T1 compared to T2 [77 ± 10-73 ± 7 % (p < 0.05)]. Mean rScO2 levels never dropped below a safety threshold of 55 %. CONCLUSION The impact of neonatal thoracoscopic repair of EA with insufflation of CO2 at 5 mmHg was studied. Intrathoracic CO2 insufflation caused a reversible decrease in SaO2 and pH and an increase in paCO2. The rScO2 was higher at anesthesia induction but remained stable and within normal limits during and after the CO2 pneumothorax, which suggest no hampering of cerebral oxygenation by the thoracoscopic intervention. Future studies will focus on the long-term effects of this surgery on the developing brain.","Tytgat, Stefaan H A J; van Herwaarden, Maud Y A; Stolwijk, Lisanne J; Keunen, Kristin; Benders, Manon J N L; de Graaff, Jurgen C; Milstein, Dan M J; van der Zee, David C; Lemmers, Petra M A",Surgical endoscopy,18,5

Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is an effective imaging method for evaluating the renovascular morphology of donor candidates. The aim of this study was to evaluate renal artery variations in kidney donors using CTA and compare the findings with the number of arteries detected during laparoscopic donor nephrectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS The study included 2,144 living donors who underwent pretransplant renovascular assessment using CTA and laparoscopic donor nephrectomy in our center between August 2012 and October 2018. The number of renal arteries to the donor kidney detected on CTA was compared with the number of arteries discovered intraoperatively. RESULTS The mean age of the 2,144 living kidney donors included in the study was 47.19 ± 13.3 (18-87) years. According to CTA findings, 81.1% (n = 1,738) had a single renal artery, 17.2% (n = 369) had double renal arteries, 1.6% (n = 35) had triple renal arteries, and 0.1% (n = 2) had quadruple renal arteries. The same number of renal arteries were detected by CTA and in laparoscopic donor nephrectomy in 97.9% (n = 2,099) of the donors. In the other 2.1% (n = 45), fewer renal arteries were detected intraoperatively compared to their CTA findings. None of the donors included in the study had a greater number of renal arteries discovered during nephrectomy than by CTA. CONCLUSION CTA is a highly accurate method for the evaluation of renovascular variations in donor candidates for living-donor kidney transplantation. However, it must be kept in mind that double or multiple renal artery variations may be detected on CTA in 18.9% of donor candidates.","Sarier, Mehmet; Callioglu, Mehmet; Yuksel, Yucel; Duman, Enes; Emek, Mestan; Usta, Sibel Surmen",Urologia internationalis,18,6

On the other hand, for Whites with colder views towards Blacks, the informational treatment had the opposite effect: it led to decreased risk perception and to lower levels of support for an aggressive response.

Evidence suggests that Crohn's disease patients with perianal fistulas need higher infliximab (IFX) serum concentrations compared to patients without perianal CD to achieve complete disease control. Our aim was to compare anti-TNF serum concentrations between patients with actively draining and closed perianal fistulas. Methods: A retrospective survey was performed in CD patients with perianal disease treated with IFX or adalimumab (ADL). Fistula closure was defined as absence of active drainage at gentle finger compression and/or fistula healing on magnetic resonance imaging. Results: We identified 66 CD patients with a history of perianal fistulas treated with IFX (n = 47) and ADL (n = 19). Median IFX serum trough concentrations ([interquartile range]) were higher in patients with closed fistulas (n = 32) compared to patients with actively draining fistulas (n = 15): 6.0 µg/ml [5.4-6.9] versus 2.3 µg/ml [1.1-4.0], respectively (p < .001)). A similar difference was seen in patients treated with ADL: median serum concentrations were 7.4 µg/ml [6.5-10.8] in 13 patients with closed fistulas versus 4.8 µg/ml [1.7-6.2] in 6 patients with producing fistulas (p = .003). Serum concentrations of ≥5.0 µg/ml for IFX (area under the curve of 0.92; 95% CI: 0.82-1.00)) and 5.9 µg/ml for ADL (area under the curve of 0.89; 95% CI 0.71-1.00) were associated with fistula closure. Conclusion: Cut-off serum concentrations ≥5.0 µg/ml for IFX and ≥5.9 µg/ml for ADL were associated with perianal fistula closure. Hence, patients with producing perianal fistulas may benefit from anti-TNF dose intensification to achieve fistula closure.","Strik, Anne S; Löwenberg, Mark; Buskens, Christianne J; B Gecse, Krisztina; I Ponsioen, Cyriel; Bemelman, Willem A; D'Haens, Geert R",Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology,18,1

Existing guidance from UK Economic and Social Research Council applies to sharing qualitative data but does not address the additional challenges related to sharing qualitative data collected within trials, including the need to incorporate the necessary information and consent into already complex recruitment processes, with the additional sensitive nature of health-related data. Methods: Work package 1 will involve separate focus group interviews with members of each stakeholder group: trial managers, clinical trialists, qualitative researchers, members of research funding bodies and trial participants who have been involved in qualitative research. Data will be analysed using thematic analysis and managed within QSR NVivo to enhance transparency. Work package 2 will involve a documentary analysis of current consent procedures for qualitative data collected as part of the conduct of clinical trials. We will include documents such as participant information leaflets and consent forms for the qualitative components in trials. We will extract data such as whether specific clauses for data sharing are included in the consent form. Content analysis will be used to analyse whether and how consent is being obtained for qualitative data sharing. Conclusions: This study will provide insight into the existing practice of sharing of qualitative data in clinical trials and the current issues and opportunities, to help shape future research and development of guidance to encourage maximum learning to be gained from this valuable data.","Houghton, Catherine; McCarthy, Megan; Gillies, Katie; Rousseau, Nikki; Wade, Julia; Gamble, Carrol; Toomey, Elaine; Matvienko-Sikar, Karen; Sydes, Matthew; Dowling, Maura; Bryant, Val; Biesty, Linda",HRB open research,18,20

This study aims to explore the effect of alcohol intensity and duration, as joint continuous exposures, on HNC risk. METHODS Data from 26 case-control studies in the INHANCE Consortium were used, including never and current drinkers who drunk ≤10 drinks/day for ≤54 years (24234 controls, 4085 oral cavity, 3359 oropharyngeal, 983 hypopharyngeal and 3340 laryngeal cancers). The dose-response relationship between the risk and the joint exposure to drinking intensity and duration was investigated through bivariate regression spline models, adjusting for potential confounders, including tobacco smoking. RESULTS For all subsites, cancer risk steeply increased with increasing drinks/day, with no appreciable threshold effect at lower intensities. For each intensity level, the risk of oral cavity, hypopharyngeal and laryngeal cancers did not vary according to years of drinking, suggesting no effect of duration. For oropharyngeal cancer, the risk increased with durations up to 28 years, flattening thereafter. The risk peaked at the higher levels of intensity and duration for all subsites (odds ratio = 7.95 for oral cavity, 12.86 for oropharynx, 24.96 for hypopharynx and 6.60 for larynx). CONCLUSIONS Present results further encourage the reduction of alcohol intensity to mitigate HNC risk.","Di Credico, Gioia; Polesel, Jerry; Dal Maso, Luigino; Pauli, Francesco; Torelli, Nicola; Luce, Daniele; Radoï, Loredana; Matsuo, Keitaro; Serraino, Diego; Brennan, Paul; Holcatova, Ivana; Ahrens, Wolfgang; Lagiou, Pagona; Canova, Cristina; Richiardi, Lorenzo; Healy, Claire M; Kjaerheim, Kristina; Conway, David I; Macfarlane, Gary J; Thomson, Peter; Agudo, Antonio; Znaor, Ariana; Franceschi, Silvia; Herrero, Rolando; Toporcov, Tatiana N; Moyses, Raquel A; Muscat, Joshua; Negri, Eva; Vilensky, Marta; Fernandez, Leticia; Curado, Maria Paula; Menezes, Ana; Daudt, Alexander W; Koifman, Rosalina; Wunsch-Filho, Victor; Olshan, Andrew F; Zevallos, Jose P; Sturgis, Erich M; Li, Guojun; Levi, Fabio; Zhang, Zuo-Feng; Morgenstern, Hal; Smith, Elaine; Lazarus, Philip; La Vecchia, Carlo; Garavello, Werner; Chen, Chu; Schwartz, Stephen M; Zheng, Tongzhang; Vaughan, Thomas L; Kelsey, Karl; McClean, Michael; Benhamou, Simone; Hayes, Richard B; Purdue, Mark P; Gillison, Maura; Schantz, Stimson; Yu, Guo-Pei; Chuang, Shu-Chun; Boffetta, Paolo; Hashibe, Mia; Yuan-Chin, Amy Lee; Edefonti, Valeria",British journal of cancer,18,16

By the end of that month, the World Health Organization, recognizing the severity of the disease and the potential for global spread, had declared a public health emergency. By February 2020, cases had been identified in multiple countries, clinical trials of treatments with some biological plausibility had begun in China, and the initial steps of vaccine development were underway. In mid-March, by which time countries around the world were experiencing rapidly increasing numbers of cases and deaths, the World Health Organization categorized the outbreak as a pandemic. This new coronavirus was designated SARS-COV-2 in recognition of its similarity to the coronavirus responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2002-2003. The race is on to develop treatments that can mitigate the severe consequences of infection and vaccines that can prevent infection and/or diminish the severity of disease in those who do get infected. Many challenges face these development efforts. Some are similar to those faced in the past; others are new. The urgency of finding ways to treat, and ultimately prevent, the consequences of this new and potentially deadly infection has led to unprecedented focus on clinical trials.","Ellenberg, Susan S",Clinical trials,18,1

Most of the time, it is diagnosed in the late stage with its associated morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to find out the prevalence of late-stage presentation of cervical cancer among confirmed cases of cervical cancer in a tertiary care centre. METHODS A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted at a tertiary care centre of Nepal from March 2021 to May 2021 after obtaining ethical clearance from the Institutional Review Board (Reference no.805). A convenient sampling method was used. A descriptive analysis was done of all cases of cervical cancer who were diagnosed within the last 36 months and attended hospital during the study period. The information was collected by interview and hospital record was checked. Analysis was done using Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 20. Point estimate at 95% Confidence Interval was calculated along with frequency and proportion for binary data. RESULTS Among the 142 confirmed cervical cancer cases, the prevalence of late-stage presentation of cervical cancer was 93 (65.5%) (57.7-73.3 at 95% Confidence Interval). The mean age at diagnosis was 50.6±10.9 years. More than two-thirds of the women were from outside Kathmandu valley 102 (71.8%) and came from >50km distance. The majority of the women 83 (58.5%) were illiterate. CONCLUSIONS The study showed that two-thirds of the women presented in advanced stage and the factors leading to the late stage. This highlights the fact, that the focus should be on the provision of organized screening programs and early diagnosis and treatment of cervical cancer.","Ojha, Neebha; Jha, Meena; Shrestha, Eliza; Dangal, Ganesh",JNMA; journal of the Nepal Medical Association,18,8
101451,101451,101451,Current risks of occupational blood-borne viral infection.,12.66181,7.3669086,2010,"BACKGROUND Neural oscillations reflect rapidly changing brain excitability states. We have demonstrated previously with EEG-triggered transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of human motor cortex that the positive vs. negative peak of the sensorimotor μ-oscillation reflect corticospinal low-vs. high-excitability states. In vitro experiments showed that induction of long-term depression (LTD) by low-frequency stimulation depends on the postsynaptic excitability state. OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS We tested the hypothesis that induction of LTD-like corticospinal plasticity in humans by 1 Hz repetitive TMS (rTMS) is enhanced when rTMS is synchronized with the low-excitability state, but decreased or even shifted towards long-term (LTP)-like plasticity when synchronized with the high-excitability state. METHODS We applied real-time EEG-triggered 1-Hz-rTMS (900 pulses) to the hand area of motor cortex in healthy subjects. In a randomized double-blind three-condition crossover design, pulses were synchronized to either the positive or negative peak of the sensorimotor μ-oscillation, or were applied at random phase (control). The amplitude of motor evoked potentials was recorded as an index of corticospinal excitability before and after 1-Hz-rTMS. RESULTS 1-Hz-rTMS at random phase resulted in a trend towards LTD-like corticospinal plasticity. RTMS in the positive peak condition (i.e., the low-excitability state) induced significant LTD-like plasticity. RTMS in the negative peak condition (i.e., the high-excitability state) showed a trend towards LTP-like plasticity, which was significantly different from the other two conditions. CONCLUSION The level of corticospinal depolarization reflected by phase of the μ-oscillation determines the degree of corticospinal plasticity induced by low-frequency rTMS, a finding that may guide future personalized therapeutic stimulation.","Baur, David; Galevska, Dragana; Hussain, Sara; Cohen, Leonardo G; Ziemann, Ulf; Zrenner, Christoph",Brain stimulation,18,16

METHODS We present retrospective analysis of masked rtCGM in 30 patients with severe COVID-19. rtCGM was used during the first 24 hours for comparison with arterial-line point of care (POC) values, where clinicians utilized rtCGM data to adjust insulin therapy in patients if rtCGM values were within 20% of point-of-care (POC) values during the masked period. An investigator-developed survey was administered to assess nursing staff (n = 66) perceptions regarding the use of rtCGM in the ICU. RESULTS rtCGM data were used to adjust insulin therapy in 30 patients. Discordance between rtCGM and POC glucose values were observed in 11 patients but the differences were not considered clinically significant. Mean sensor glucose decreased from 235.7 ± 42.1 mg/dL (13.1 ± 2.1 mmol/L) to 202.7 ± 37.6 mg/dL (11.1 ± 2.1 mmol/L) with rtCGM management. Improvements in mean sensor glucose were observed in 77% of patients (n = 23) with concomitant reductions in daily POC measurements in 50% of patients (n = 15) with rtCGM management. The majority (63%) of nurses reported that rtCGM was helpful for improving care for patients with diabetes patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, and 49% indicated that rtCGM reduced their use of personal protective equipment (PPE). CONCLUSIONS Our findings provide a strong rationale to increase clinician awareness for the adoption and implementation of rtCGM systems in the ICU. Additional studies are needed to further understand the utility of rtCGM in critically ill patients and other clinical care settings.","Chow, Kenneth W; Kelly, Danielle J; Rieff, Mary C; Skala, Patricia A; Kravets, Igor; Charitou, Marina M; Morley, Eric J; Gupta, Rajarsi; Miller, Joshua D",Journal of diabetes science and technology,18,9

METHODS From November 2010 to April 2014, a total of 10 patients with VVF underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic VVF repair. The principles of VVF repair were followed. The fistula tract was excised. The vagina defect and the cystotomy were closed with a flap of epiploica of sigmoid colon, a peritoneal inlay, or a bladder adventitia layer interposed between the bladder and vaginal suture lines. Perioperative patient characteristics, complications, operative data, and follow-up results were retrospectively reviewed with institutional review board approval. RESULTS All 10 patients developed VVF as a result of previous elective hysterectomies for benign indications. Mean operative time was 214 minutes (range, 120-457 minutes). Longer operative times were caused by concomitant surgeries (3 ureteral reimplantations and 1 planned sigmoid colectomy). Median length of stay was 1 day (range, 1-5 days). There were no intraoperative complications. Perioperatively, there was 1 Clavien-Dindo grade 1 complication (ileus), and 2 grade 2 complications (readmission with Clostridium difficile infection and atelectasis). All patients were cured and were without VVF recurrence at a median follow-up close to 2 years. CONCLUSION Robot-assisted laparoscopic VVF repair is an effective approach to manage VVF even in complex medical scenarios. It is anticipated that an increasing number of VVF repairs will be undertaken with robot-assisted approach in the future, offering more patients who need VVF repair the advantages of minimally invasive surgery.","Agrawal, Vineet; Kucherov, Victor; Bendana, Emma; Joseph, Jean; Rashid, Hani; Wu, Guan",Urology,18,31

Although ultrasound is frequently employed as a diagnostic tool in similar cases, this modality can only provide information on gross abnormalities in organ size and shape, echogenicity and internal architecture; even with ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration a definitive diagnosis is rarely achieved. So the clinician and owner are left with unanswered questions that are central to the diagnosis, the most appropriate treatment to pursue and the prognosis for the cat. Laparoscopy does require anesthesia and is more expensive than ultrasound; however, when performed correctly, it is only marginally more invasive and vastly more informative, with a proven track record of minimal morbidity. AUDIENCE This article is aimed at all feline practitioners, from first opinion through to the referral setting. It is intended to encourage practitioners untrained in minimally invasive procedures to seek formalized training, especially those who want to expand their diagnostic capabilities. For those already performing minimally invasive surgery, it describes how laparoscopic techniques can be applied to many feline gastrointestinal cases.

Since its first appearance in December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, China, SARS-CoV-2 infection has quickly spread across the globe, with the first case reported on the African continent, in Egypt on February 14 th, 2020. Although the global number of COVID-19 infections has increased exponentially since the beginning of the pandemic, the number of new infections and deaths recorded in African countries have been relatively modest, suggesting slower transmission dynamics of the virus on the continent, a lower case fatality rate, or simply a lack of testing or reliable data. Notably, there is no significant increase in unexplained pneumonias or deaths on the continent which could possibly indicate the effectiveness of interventions introduced by several African governments. However, there has not yet been a comprehensive assessment of sub-Saharan Africa's (SSA) preparedness and response to the COVID-19 pandemic that may have contributed to prevent an uncontrolled outbreak so far. As a group of early career scientists and the next generation of African scientific leaders with experience of working in medical and diverse health research fields in both SSA and resource-rich countries, we present a unique perspective on the current public health interventions to fight COVID-19 in Africa. Our perspective is based on extensive review of the available scientific publications, official technical reports and announcements released by governmental and non-governmental health organizations as well as from our personal experiences as workers on the COVID-19 battlefield in SSA. We documented public health interventions implemented in seven SSA countries including Uganda, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, Zambia, South Africa and Botswana, the existing gaps and the important components of disease control that may strengthen SSA response to future outbreaks.","Umviligihozo, Gisele; Mupfumi, Lucy; Sonela, Nelson; Naicker, Delon; Obuku, Ekwaro A; Koofhethile, Catherine; Mogashoa, Tuelo; Kapaata, Anne; Ombati, Geoffrey; Michelo, Clive M; Makobu, Kimani; Todowede, Olamide; Balinda, Sheila N",Wellcome open research,18,16

Further research is needed to determine which mHealth features are required to potentially enhance COPD self-management. AIM The aim of this study was to explore the potential features of an mHealth intervention for COPD management with healthcare providers (HCPs) and patients with COPD. It could inform the development and successful implementation of mHealth interventions for COPD management. METHODS This was a qualitative study. We conducted semi-structured individual interviews with HCPs, including nurses, pharmacists and physicians who work directly with patients with COPD. Interviews were also conducted with a diverse sample of patients with COPD. Interview topics included demographics, mHealth usage, the potential use of medical devices and recommendations for features that would enhance an mHealth intervention for COPD management. RESULTS A total of 40 people, including nurses, physicians and pharmacists, participated. The main recommendations for the proposed mHealth intervention were categorised into two categories: patient interface and HCP interface. The prevalent features suggested for the patient interface include educating patients, collecting baseline data, collecting subjective data, collecting objective data via compatible medical devices, providing a digital action plan, allowing patients to track their progress, enabling family members to access the mHealth intervention, tailoring the features based on the patient's unique needs, reminding patients about critical management tasks and rewarding patients for their positive behaviours. The most common features of the HCP interface include allowing HCPs to track their patients' progress, allowing HCPs to communicate with their patients, educating HCPs and rewarding HCPs. CONCLUSION This study identifies important potential features so that the most effective, efficient and feasible mHealth intervention can be developed to improve the management of COPD.The reviews of this paper are available via the supplemental material section.","Alwashmi, Meshari F; Fitzpatrick, Beverly; Davis, Erin; Farrell, Jamie; Gamble, John-Michael; Hawboldt, John",Therapeutic advances in respiratory disease,18,1

METHOD We selected two relevant processing steps, denoise and segmentation, implemented by two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) models based on autoencoder architecture (encoder-decoder and UNet) and trained for the two tasks. In order to limit the number of uncontrolled variables, we designed a phantom containing cylindrical inserts of different sizes, filled with iodinated contrast media. A large CT image dataset was collected at different acquisition settings and two reconstruction algorithms. We characterized the CNNs behavior using metrics from the signal detection theory, radiological and conventional image quality parameters, and finally unconventional radiomic features analysis. RESULTS The UNet, due to the deeper architecture complexity, outperformed the shallower encoder-decoder in terms of conventional quality parameters and preserved spatial resolution. We also studied how the CNNs modify the noise texture by using radiomic analysis, identifying sensitive and insensitive features to the denoise processing. CONCLUSIONS The proposed evaluation approach proved effective to accurately analyze and quantify the differences in CNNs behavior, in particular with regard to the alterations introduced in the processed images. Our results suggest that even a deeper and more complex network, which achieves good performances, is not necessarily a better network because it can modify texture features in an unwanted way.","Doria, Sandra; Valeri, Federico; Lasagni, Lorenzo; Sanguineti, Valentina; Ragonesi, Ruggero; Akbar, Muhammad Usman; Gnerucci, Alessio; Del Bue, Alessio; Marconi, Alessandro; Risaliti, Guido; Grigioni, Mauro; Miele, Vittorio; Sona, Diego; Cisbani, Evaristo; Gori, Cesare; Taddeucci, Adriana",Physica medica : PM : an international journal devoted to the applications of physics to medicine and biology : official journal of the Italian Association of Biomedical Physics,18,29

Among them, voltage hysteresis is the most troublesome because its origin is still unclear and under debate. Herein, we tackle this issue by designing a prototypical Li-rich cation-disordered rock-salt compound Li1.17Ti0.33Fe0.5O2 that shows anionic redox activity and exceptionally large voltage hysteresis while exhibiting a partially reversible Fe migration between octahedral and tetrahedral sites. Through combined in situ and ex situ spectroscopic techniques, we demonstrate the existence of a non-equilibrium (adiabatic) redox pathway enlisting Fe3+/Fe4+ and O redox as opposed to the equilibrium (non-adiabatic) redox pathway involving sole O redox. We further show that the charge transfer from O(2p) lone pair states to Fe(3d) states involving sluggish structural distortion is responsible for voltage hysteresis. This study provides a general understanding of various voltage hysteresis signatures in the large family of Li-rich rock-salt compounds.","Li, Biao; Sougrati, Moulay Tahar; Rousse, Gwenaëlle; Morozov, Anatolii V; Dedryvère, Rémi; Iadecola, Antonella; Senyshyn, Anatoliy; Zhang, Leiting; Abakumov, Artem M; Doublet, Marie-Liesse; Tarascon, Jean-Marie",Nature chemistry,18,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS In this prospective study, 30 patients with single medium-sized HCCs (mean, 3.5 cm; range, 3.1-4.4 cm) were enrolled. The patients were treated under ultrasonographic guidance by percutaneous switching monopolar RFA with a multichannel RF generator and two or three internally cooled electrodes. Contrast-enhanced CT scans were obtained immediately after RFA, and the diameters and volume of the ablation zones were then measured. Follow-up CT scans were performed at the first month after ablation and every three months thereafter. Technical effectiveness, local progression and remote recurrence of HCCs were determined. RESULTS There were no major immediate or periprocedural complications. However, there was one bile duct stricture during the follow-up period. Technical effectiveness was achieved in 29 of 30 patients (97%). The total ablation time of the procedures was 25.4 ± 8.9 minutes. The mean ablation volume was 73.8 ± 56.4 cm(3) and the minimum diameter was 4.1 ± 7.3 cm. During the follow-up period (mean, 12.5 months), local tumor progression occurred in three of 29 patients (10%) with technical effectiveness, while new HCCs were detected in six of 29 patients (21%). CONCLUSION Switching monopolar RFA with multiple electrodes in order to achieve a sufficient ablation volume is safe and efficient. This method also showed relatively successful therapeutic effectiveness on short-term follow up for the treatment of medium-sized HCCs.","Lee, Jung; Lee, Jeong Min; Yoon, Jung-Hwan; Lee, Jae Young; Kim, Se Hyung; Lee, Jeong Eun; Han, Joon Koo; Choi, Byung Ihn",Korean journal of radiology,18,1

METHODS Retinal detachment with a small tear was performed on 20 New Zealand rabbits. Thereafter, rabbits were divided into two groups; the experimental group received a transscleral injection of 0.1 ml DS into the subretinal space whereas the control group received sham injection of saline. Eyes were clinically evaluated using indirect ophthalmoscopy, retinal function was recorded in ten rabbits by electroretinography and the sealant's toxicity was evaluated histopathologically. RESULTS We found that the DS hydrogel was easily injected transsclerally into the subretinal space of the detached retinas with no major complications. Retinal reattachment was seen in both groups within 2 weeks with no toxicity to the sensory retina. There were no significant differences in retinal function between groups. CONCLUSION Subretinal injection of hydrogel through a transscleral route is easy to perform and may open a new avenue in the treatment of retinal detachment. However, the efficacy of the DS as a tamponade for sealing retinal tear is yet to be definite. Long-term clinical, functional, and toxicological studies are needed to evaluate its full potential for clinical applications.","Barliya, Tilda; Sandalon, Shai; Ofri, Ron; Livnat, Tami; Weinberger, Dov",Indian journal of ophthalmology,18,24

Spillover of hantaviruses to humans can cause severe disease that is mediated by excessive proinflammatory responses. The mechanisms mediating hantaviral persistence in rodent reservoirs remain largely unknown. Male Norway rats were inoculated with their species-specific hantavirus, Seoul virus (SEOV), and viral RNA, cytokine, and chemokine responses were evaluated in spleen and lung tissue. More viral RNA was detectable in the lungs than spleen, with copies of SEOV peaking 15-30 days post-inoculation (p.i.) and persisting for 60 days p.i. In the lungs, the expression and production of proinflammatory mediators (i.e., IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, CCL5, CCL2, CX3CL1, CXCL10, VCAM, VEGF, and NOS2) remained at or below baseline throughout SEOV infection; whereas, regulatory factors, including TGF-beta and FoxP3 were elevated. Conversely, in the spleen, proinflammatory responses were induced while regulatory responses remained unchanged during infection. To determine whether reduced proinflammatory responses mediate hantavirus persistence in the lungs, male rats were administered rIL-1beta or vehicle for 30 days during SEOV infection. SEOV persistence and shedding were not affected by IL-1beta treatment. Proinflammatory responses were elevated in rIL-1beta-treated rats, but remained within physiological levels, suggesting that supra-physiological concentrations may be necessary for viral clearance at the cost of causing disease. Elevated regulatory responses may suppress excessively high proinflammatory responses at a site of elevated SEOV replication to contribute to viral persistence and prevent proinflammatory-mediated disease in reservoir hosts.","Easterbrook, Judith D; Klein, Sabra L",Journal of medical virology,18,12

This study aims to analyze local recurrence associated with this new treatment modality in patients with malignant liver tumors. METHODS This is a prospective clinical study of patients who underwent microwave thermosphere ablation of malignant liver tumors between September 2014 and March 2017. Clinical, operative, and oncologic parameters were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS One hundred patients underwent 301 ablations. Ablations were performed laparoscopically in 87 and open in 13 patients. Pathology included neuroendocrine liver metastasis (n = 115), colorectal liver metastasis (n = 100), hepatocellular cancer (n = 21), and other tumor types (n = 65). Ninety-day morbidity was 7% with one not procedure-related mortality. Median follow-up was 16 months with 65% of patients completing at least 12 months of follow-up. The rate of local tumor recurrence rate per lesion was 6.6% (20/301). Local tumor, new hepatic, and extrahepatic recurrences were detected in 15%, 40%, and 40% of patients, respectively. Local recurrence rate per pathology was 12% for both colorectal liver metastasis (12/100) and other metastatic tumors (8/65). No local recurrence was observed to date in the neuroendocrine liver metastasis and in the limited number of patients with hepatocellular cancers. Tumor size >3 cm and tumor type were independent predictors of local recurrence. CONCLUSION This is the first study to analyze local recurrence after microwave thermosphere ablation of malignant liver tumors. Short-term local tumor control rate compares favorably with that reported for radiofrequency and other microwave technologies in the literature.","Takahashi, Hideo; Kahramangil, Bora; Berber, Eren",Surgery,18,26

However, reports about the association between changes in cerebral oxygenation and clinical parameters at hemodialysis initiation, including hemoglobin level, are lacking. METHODS This study included 33 patients at the hemodialysis initiation phase. Cerebral rSO2 was monitored using an INVOS 5100C. Included patients were assessed twice (at hemodialysis initiation and 42.7 ± 20.8 days after the first measurement), and changes in cerebral rSO2 were compared with changes in clinical parameters. RESULTS Cerebral rSO2 at the second measurement significantly increased compared with that at hemodialysis initiation (57.2 ± 6.8% vs 54.4 ± 8.8%, p < 0.05). Changes in cerebral rSO2 represented a significant correlation with changes in hemoglobin level, pulse rate, and serum albumin level. Multivariate linear regression analysis was performed using significant factors in simple linear regression analysis. Changes in hemoglobin (standardized coefficient: 0.37) and serum albumin (standardized coefficient: 0.45) levels were identified as independent factors influencing the changes in cerebral rSO2. CONCLUSION Cerebral rSO2 was low in the presence of low hemoglobin levels at hemodialysis initiation and improved in response to hemoglobin increase in addition to changes in serum albumin levels. Attention should be paid to changes in hemoglobin levels even at hemodialysis initiation to prevent the deterioration of cerebral oxygenation, and this might contribute to the maintenance of cognitive function in patients undergoing hemodialysis.","Ito, Kiyonori; Ookawara, Susumu; Ueda, Yuichiro; Miyazawa, Haruhisa; Uchida, Takayuki; Kofuji, Masaya; Hayasaka, Hideyuki; Minato, Saori; Kaneko, Shohei; Mutsuyoshi, Yuko; Yanai, Katsunori; Ishii, Hiroki; Matsuyama, Momoko; Kitano, Taisuke; Shindo, Mitsutoshi; Aomatsu, Akinori; Hirai, Keiji; Hoshino, Taro; Tabei, Kaoru; Morishita, Yoshiyuki",The International journal of artificial organs,18,1

STUDY DESIGN A systematic search and review procedure was conducted of research reporting use and results of the PedsQL-TM with samples of pediatric heart, liver, kidney, and lung transplantation. Searches were conducted in nine scholarly databases and two additional sources to identify unpublished research. Multiple reviewers screened studies meeting inclusion criteria in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. RESULTS A final sample of nine studies reported findings for the PedsQL-TM with pediatric organ transplant recipients. Most studies relied on either kidney or liver transplant recipients from single pediatric transplant centers. Factor validity of the PedsQL-TM and inter-rater reliability (IRR) between patients and parents have not been adequately determined. Internal consistency reliability was found as acceptable or excellent across multiple studies. PedsQL-TM scores were found to vary with other HRQOL issues, yet few studies examined their association with medication adherence or posttransplant health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS With the goal of enhancing and sustaining HRQOL in pediatric organ transplant recipients, the need for a psychometrically valid and reliable measure of transplant-specific HRQOL is apparent. Research on the PedsQL-TM supports the promise of this measure although future efforts should be taken to examine measurement issues such as factor validity and IRR. Assessing transplant-specific HRQOL in these patients is paramount for their care and appropriate decision-making by patients, families, and the transplant team.","Killian, Michael O; Triplett, Kelli N; Masood, Saba S; Boehler, Jason; Mayersohn, Gillian S","Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation",18,11

The aim of the present study was to make a detailed description of re-interventions after EVAR-including incidence, indications, procedures, and outcome-with special reference to non-access-related re-interventions. METHODS This is a retrospective single-center cohort study of re-interventions after standard EVAR with special reference to non-access-related re-interventions. Consecutive patients (n = 405) treated with standard EVAR for non-ruptured (n = 337) or ruptured (n = 68) infrarenal aneurysms between 2005 and 2013 were analysed. Median follow-up was 29 months (range 0-108). RESULTS Eighty-nine patients (22 %) underwent 113 re-interventions during follow-up. Twenty-seven patients (7 %) had 28 access related re-intervention, 65 patients (16 %) had 85 non-access related reinterventions. Non-access related re-interventions were more common in ruptured aneurysms than in unruptured aneurysms (22 vs. 15 %, p = 0.002). The most frequent indications were endoleak type I (n = 19), type II (n = 21), or type III (n = 5); stent graft migration (n = 9); and thrombosis (n = 14). The most frequent procedures were embolization of endoleak type II (n = 21), additional iliac stent graft (n = 19), proximal extension (n = 12), thrombolysis (n = 8), iliac limb bare-metal stenting (n = 6), and stent graft relining (n = 7). Endovascular technique was used in 83 % of re-interventions. Thirty-day mortality after non-access-related re-interventions was 15 % when initiated from symptoms (rupture or infection) and 0 % when initiated from follow-up findings (p = 0.014). Cumulative survival five years after EVAR was 72 % in patients with a re-intervention and 59 % in patients without (p = 0.21). CONCLUSIONS Non-access-related re-intervention rates are still considerable after EVAR and more frequent after ruptured aneurysms. Endoleak embolization is the most frequent procedure, followed by additional iliac stent grafts. Outcomes after re-interventions are generally good, except when initiated by rupture or infection.","Roos, Håkan; Djerf, Henrik; Brisby Jeppsson, Ludvig; Fröjd, Victoria; Axelsson, Tomas; Jeppsson, Anders; Falkenberg, Mårten",BMC cardiovascular disorders,18,17

Macaca tonkeana is classified as a tolerant macaque species characterized by social interactions minimally constrained by dominance rank or kinship. Tonkean macaques, as other egalitarian species, rely on a complex facial communicative system. We found that the degree of mouth opening (ranging from covered to uncovered tooth yawns) and the duration of yawning were not strictly dependent. The shortest uncovered tooth yawns were associated with an intense locomotor/physical activity and peaked immediately after stressful social events thus indicating an increase in arousal. In contrast, longer yawns, independently from teeth exposure, were primarily associated with a relaxed state of the subject. In conclusion, our study suggests that to explore the potential different functions of yawning, it is necessary to focus on the variability of its expression both in terms of morphology and duration, because not all yawns tell the same story.","Zannella, Alessandra; Stanyon, Roscoe; Maglieri, Veronica; Palagi, Elisabetta",American journal of primatology,18,4

The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship of children and adolescents with suspected Idiopathic Torsional Deformities (ITD) and pain, gait function, activity and participation. METHODS A retrospective review of all children and adolescents who attended our Centre over a 5-year period for evaluation of the effect of ITD. All children completed three-dimensional gait analysis (3DGA), standardized physical examination, medical imaging and the Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument (PODCI). Statistical analysis was completed using two sample t-tests, Pearson's Correlation and linear regression. RESULTS Fifty children and adolescents, 40 females and 10 males with a mean age of 13.5 years were included. Children reported a high prevalence of pain(86%), had increased internal hip rotation(p = 0.002) and decreased external hip rotation(p < 0.001) on physical examination when compared to published normative data. Medical imaging showed a mean(SD) femoral neck anteversion (FNA) of 38°(13°) and external tibial torsion of 39°(12°). Mean(SD) PODCI score was 32(16), indicating these children are functioning below their typically developing peers. The 3DGA kinematics show deviations from typical data including hip rotation, foot progression, pelvic tilt, hip flexion and knee extension. Observed mild kinetic deviations were within typical limits. The relationship between FNA and gait parameters, FNA and PODCI and gait and PODCI were weak. SIGNIFICANCE These children and adolescents have altered gait and experience pain leading to impaired function and diminished participation. Therefore, ITD is not purely a cosmetic issue.","Mackay, Jessie; Thomason, Pam; Sangeux, Morgan; Passmore, Elyse; Francis, Kate; Graham, H Kerr",Gait & posture,18,16

METHODOLOGY Our study included age and sex-based analysis of epidemiological data of infected and deceased patients from various countries. The patient data was graphically depicted with the slope's calculation to describe a gradual or steep spread of the disease along with subsequent rise or fall in the death reports. RESULTS Population groups of 20-49 years of age and 50 years-above were highly vulnerable to infection. Interestingly, 20-49 years of age group was most affected in India. However, higher population of the deceased were reported in the 50 years-above in all countries. India and South Korea demonstrated a gradual appearance of COVID-19 positive cases than other countries illustrated by reduced slope %. Further the highest percentage of infected people and deaths were reported from the densely populated states of India. We observed a sex independent prevalence of COVID-19. The BCG and JE vaccine are unique in the vaccination regime of India and South Korea. CONCLUSIONS Reduced ACE-2 expression in the children's nasal epithelium may be responsible for reduced SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility. Countries showed varying patterns in COVID-19 spread and associated mortality. It may be influenced by factors, such as screening strategy, countries demography, implementation of lockdown, etc. Due to limited evidence, it would be difficult to point to the influence of the virus on either sexes. Although vaccines may stimulate non-specific immunity, experimental proofs are needed to demonstrate the potential of any vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.","Jakhmola, Shweta; Baral, Budhadev; Jha, Hem Chandra",Journal of infection in developing countries,18,16

MATERIAL AND METHODS Eleven postbrachytherapy prostate cancer patients underwent HR-CEMRI and CT imaging. Computed tomography and HR-CEMRI images were randomized and 2 independent expert readers created contours of prostate, intra- and peri-prostatic structures on each CT and HR-CEMRI scan for all 11 patients. Dosimetry data including V100, D90, and D100 was calculated from these contours. RESULTS Mean V100 values from CT and HR-CEMRI contours were as follows: prostate (98.5% and 96.2%, p = 0.003), urethra (81.0% and 88.7%, p = 0.027), anterior rectal wall (ARW) (8.9% and 2.8%, p < 0.001), left NVB (77.9% and 51.5%, p = 0.002), right NVB (69.2% and 43.1%, p = 0.001), and PB (0.09% and 11.4%, p = 0.005). Mean D90 (Gy) derived from CT and HR-CEMRI contours were: prostate (167.6 and 150.3, p = 0.012), urethra (81.6 and 109.4, p = 0.041), ARW (2.5 and 0.11, p = 0.003), left NVB (98.2 and 58.6, p = 0.001), right NVB (87.5 and 55.5, p = 0.001), and PB (11.2 and 12.4, p = 0.554). CONCLUSIONS Findings of this study suggest that HR-CEMRI facilitates accurate and meaningful dosimetric assessment of prostate and clinically relevant structures, which is not possible with CT. Significant differences were seen between CT and HR-CEMRI, with volume overestimation of CT derived contours compared to HR-CEMRI.","Buch, Karen; Morancy, Tye; Kaplan, Irving; Qureshi, Muhammad M; Hirsch, Ariel E; Rofksy, Neil M; Holupka, Edward; Oismueller, Renee; Hawliczek, Robert; Helbich, Thomas H; Bloch, B Nicolas",Journal of contemporary brachytherapy,18,11

The use of full, standard preparation and draping with standard personal protective equipment (PPE) may not be necessary during this procedure. This is of particular interest in the current climate as we face unprecedented PPE shortages due to the current COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS This is a retrospective chart review of 1,270 patients treated with CRPP of a supracondylar humeral fracture at 2 metropolitan pediatric centers by 10 fellowship-trained pediatric orthopaedic surgeons. One surgeon in the group did not wear a mask when performing CRPP of supracondylar humeral fractures, and multiple surgeons in the group utilized a semisterile preparation technique (no sterile gown or drapes). Infectious outcomes were compared between 2 groups: full sterile preparation and semisterile preparation. We additionally analyzed a subgroup of patients who had semisterile preparation without surgeon mask use. Hospital cost data were used to estimate annual cost savings with the adoption of the semisterile technique. RESULTS In this study, 1,270 patients who underwent CRPP of a supracondylar humeral fracture and met inclusion criteria were identified. There were 3 deep infections (0.24%). These infections all occurred in the group using full sterile preparation and surgical masks. No clinically relevant pin-track infections were noted. There were no known surgeon occupational exposures to bodily fluid. It is estimated that national adoption of this technique in the United States could save between 18,612 and 22,162 gowns and masks with costs savings of $3.7 million to $4.4 million annually. CONCLUSIONS We currently face critical shortages of PPE due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Data from this large series suggest that a semisterile technique during CRPP of supracondylar humeral fractures is a safe practice. We anticipate that this could preserve approximately 20,000 gowns and masks in the United States over the next year. Physicians are encouraged to reevaluate their daily practice to identify safe opportunities for resource preservation. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Therapeutic Level III.

The total dose of steroid, gender, age, stage, lesion location, volume of necrosis, viable lateral column and bone marrow edema were analyzed and correlated with progression. During the 7 years of follow-up, 66 hips progressed to symptoms, 50 hips collapsed and 10 hips showed complete regression. Fifty-seven hips (86.36 %) caused pain and 32 (64.00 %) collapsed within 3 years of steroid administration. The lesion was relatively larger, and there was relatively less viable lateral column in hips that exhibited symptoms or collapsed. Mechanical failure of the necrotic segment of bone principally occurred within 3 years after the administration of steroids. Larger lesions and less viable lateral column were the main risk factors for progression. Small ONFH lesions seldom collapsed.","Zhao, Feng-Chao; Guo, Kai-Jin; Li, Zi-Rong",European journal of orthopaedic surgery & traumatology : orthopedie traumatologie,18,6

However, age and sex have been shown to influence the neurotoxicity of repeated low-level OP exposure. Therefore, to determine the influence of sex and age on outcomes associated with acute OP intoxication, postnatal day 28 Sprague-Dawley male and female rats were exposed to the OP diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP; 3.4 mg/kg, s.c.) or an equal volume of vehicle (∼80 µL saline, s.c.) followed by atropine sulfate (0.1 mg/kg, i.m.) and pralidoxime (2-PAM; 25 mg/kg, i.m.). Seizure activity was assessed during the first 4 h post-exposure using behavioral criteria and electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings. At 1 d post-exposure, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was measured in cortical tissue, and at 1, 7, and 28 d post-exposure, brains were collected for neuropathologic analyses. At 1 month post-DFP, animals were analyzed for motor ability, learning and memory, and hippocampal neurogenesis. Acute DFP intoxication triggered more severe seizure behavior in males than females, which was supported by EEG recordings. DFP caused significant neurodegeneration and persistent microglial activation in numerous brain regions of both sexes, but astrogliosis occurred earlier and was more severe in males compared to females. DFP males and females exhibited pronounced memory deficits relative to sex-matched controls. In contrast, acute DFP intoxication altered hippocampal neurogenesis in males, but not females. These findings demonstrate that acute DFP intoxication triggers seizures in juvenile rats of both sexes, but the seizure severity varies by sex. Some, but not all, chronic neurotoxic outcomes also varied by sex. The spatiotemporal patterns of neurological damage suggest that microglial activation may be a more important factor than astrogliosis or altered neurogenesis in the pathogenesis of cognitive deficits in juvenile rats acutely intoxicated with OPs.","González, Eduardo A; Calsbeek, Jonas J; Tsai, Yi-Hua; Tang, Mei-Yun; Andrew, Peter; Vu, Joan; Berg, Elizabeth L; Saito, Naomi H; Harvey, Danielle J; Supasai, Suangsuda; Gurkoff, Gene G; Silverman, Jill L; Lein, Pamela J",Current research in toxicology,18,16

Approach: We built a predictive model based on a supervised hybrid neural network utilizing a three-dimensional convolutional neural network to perform volume analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and integration of nonimaging clinical data at the fully connected layer of the architecture. The experiments are conducted on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset. Results: Experimental results confirm that there is a correlation between cognitive decline and the data obtained at the first visit. The system achieved an area under the receiver operator curve of 0.70 for cognitive decline class prediction. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first study that predicts ""slowly deteriorating/stable"" or ""rapidly deteriorating"" classes by processing routinely collected baseline clinical and demographic data [baseline MRI, baseline mini-mental state examination (MMSE), scalar volumetric data, age, gender, education, ethnicity, and race]. The training data are built based on MMSE-rate values.

DATA SOURCES A search of EMBASE, PubMed, and Google Scholar (January 1990 to May 2021), limited to the English language, using applicable search terms resulted in 137 articles, with 21 relevant articles included. Regulatory agency and clinical guidance documents were also reviewed. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION Included articles describe in vitro or in vivo animal or human data for dexamethasone induction of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 or P-glycoprotein (P-gp). DATA SYNTHESIS Dexamethasone has the potential to interact with the DOACs via CYP3A4 and/or P-gp induction. Only apixaban and rivaroxaban have CYP3A4 metabolism. Dexamethasone can increase CYP3A4 activity by up to 70% and reduce the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of CYP3A4 substrates by >40%, which is consistent with criteria for a weak CYP inducer. In rodents, dexamethasone P-gp induction is associated with AUC reductions of 20% to 50%. Human data are lacking. RELEVANCE TO PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL PRACTICE Severe COVID-19 infection is associated with hypercoagulability. Although heparins are the preferred anticoagulants for hospitalized COVID-19 patients, DOACs are being utilized. Dexamethasone is recommended for hospitalized COVID-19 patients requiring supplemental oxygen. The concurrent use of dexamethasone and apixaban or rivaroxaban in such patients carries the potential for reduced anticoagulant effect during a state of heightened thrombotic risk. CONCLUSIONS Concurrent use of dexamethasone and apixaban or rivaroxaban in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with laboratory evidence of COVID coagulopathy should be avoided until higher-quality data are available.","Smythe, Maureen A; Burns, Carly; Liu, Qianyue; Garwood, Candice L",The Annals of pharmacotherapy,18,33

The prosocial orientation was measured with individuals' performance in the dictator game (DG), social value orientation (SVO), and the personal norm of reciprocity. Prosocial and proself punishers were established with responses in advantage and disadvantage offers in the UG. Results showed that prosocial and proself punishers coexisted in the UG, and prosocial punishers were more likely to be prosocial in SVO and allocated more resources to the recipient in the DG than proself punishers, but differences in positive/negative reciprocity between prosocial and proself punishers were not found. Further regression analysis found that SVO type and generosity in the DG could predict the type of punishers in the UG, but not positive/negative reciprocity. These findings indicate that individuals rejecting unfair offers in the UG may be motivated by either prosocial motivation with strict fairness concern (prosocial punishment) or selfish motivation with maximizing self-interest concern (proself punishment). Moreover, SVO type and generosity in the DG might be effective measures to discriminate prosocial and proself punishers in the UG.","Li, Jing; Cheng, Nanhua; Hou, Wenwen",PsyCh journal,18,1

Recent evidence on effectiveness of primary care interventions has attracted renewed calls for their implementation. This review aims to synthesize evidence pertaining to primary care interventions on these two diseases, evaluated and tested in LMICs. METHODS Two reviewers conducted an electronic search of three databases (Pubmed, EMBASE and Web of Science) and screened for eligible articles. Interventions covering health promotion, prevention, treatment, or rehabilitation activities at the PHC or community level were included. Studies published in English, French, Portuguese and Spanish, from January 2007 to January 2017, were included. Key extraction variables included the 12 criteria identified by the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist and guide. The Innovative Care for Chronic Conditions Framework (ICCCF) was used to guide analysis and reporting of results. RESULTS 198 articles were analyzed. The strategies focused on healthcare service organization (76.5%), community level (9.7 %), creating a positive policy environment (3.6%) and strategies covering multiple domains (10.2%). Studies included related to the following topics: description or testing of interventions (n=81; 41.3%), implementation or evaluation projects (n=42; 21.4%), quality improvement initiatives (n=15; 7.7%), screening and prevention efforts (n=26; 13.2%), management of HTN or DM (n=13; 6.6%), integrated health services (n=10; 5.1%), knowledge and attitude surveys (n=5; 2.5%), cost-effective lab tests (n=2; 1%) and policy making efforts (n=2; 1%). Most studies reported interventions by non-specialists (n=86; 43.4%) and multidisciplinary teams (n=49; 25.5%).

This review shows the variety and complexity of approaches that have been tested to address HTN and DM in LMICs and highlights the elements of interventions needed to be addressed in order to strengthen delivery of care. Most studies reported little information regarding implementation processes to allow replication. Given the need for multi-component complex interventions, study designs and evaluation techniques will need to be adapted by including process evaluations versus simply effectiveness or outcome evaluations.","Correia, Jorge César; Lachat, Sarah; Lagger, Grégoire; Chappuis, François; Golay, Alain; Beran, David",BMC public health,18,1

AIM To report a survey about self-reported adherence to recommendations aimed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, among health care personnel. MATERIAL AND METHODS A cross-sectional survey among health professionals about adherence to recommendations to prevent COVID-19 transmission was carried out in a public hospital in Chile. The survey had 11 questions and was developed using Delphi methodology, according to the recommendations of the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control. RESULTS The survey was answered by 137 of 155 invited workers. Hand washing, use of personal protection equipment, use of the elbow or tissue to sneeze, out-of-hospital hand washing and exclusive use of the uniform in the hospital, had an adherence of over 90%. The adherence to face touching avoidance during working hours, and face mask use in the public areas, was over 50%. No statistical differences were observed between gender or professionals.

Case A 34-year-old female patient who underwent orthognathic surgery exhibited repeated endotracheal tube cuff tears during nasotracheal intubation. After intubation, leaks developed, and torn endotracheal cuff was observed in the removed endotracheal tube. Subsequently, re-intubation through the same nasal cavity was performed immediately, but leakage from the torn endotracheal tube cuff was re-observed. A leakage test of the extubated tube revealed air bubbles and leaks near the tube cuff due to the tear. Nasotracheal intubation was performed through the other nasal cavity, and there were no leakage findings or abnormalities. During the course of the surgery, the surgeon noticed that the orthodontic micro-implant deposited in the mid-tube cavity was exposed to the nasal cavity. Conclusions We aimed to emphasize caution and discuss the possibility that orthodontic micro-implants that are not confirmed during preoperative evaluation may cause repeated endotracheal tube cuff tears.","Seo, Su Hyun; Lee, Jun Mo; Lee, Je Jin; Ahn, Eun Jin; Choi, Geun Joo; Kang, Hyun",Anesthesia and pain medicine,18,11

With an ageing population, osteoporosis, fractures and their associated costs are increasing. Unfortunately, despite effective therapies, many with osteoporosis remain undiagnosed and untreated. Models of care (MoC) to improve outcomes include fracture liaison services, screening, education, and exercise programs, however efficacy for these is mixed. The aim of this study is to summarise MoC in osteoporosis and describe implementation characteristics and evidence for improving outcomes. Methods This systematic scoping review identified articles via Ovid Medline and Embase, published in English between 01/01/2009 and 15/06/2021, describing MoC for adults aged ≥18 years with, or at risk of, osteoporosis and / or health professionals caring for this group. All included at least one of clinical, consumer or clinician outcomes, with fractures and bone mineral density (BMD) change the primary clinical outcomes. Exclusion criteria were studies assessing pharmaceuticals or procedures without other interventions, or insufficient operational details. All study designs were included, with no comparator necessary. Title and abstract were reviewed by two reviewers. Full text review and data extraction was performed by these reviewers for 20% of article and, thereafter by a single author. As the review was predominantly descriptive, no comparator statistics were used. Findings 314 articles were identified describing 289 MoC with fracture liaison services (n=89) and education programs (n=86) predominating. The population had prior fragility fracture in 77 studies, the median (IQR) patient number was 210 (87, 667) and the median (IQR) follow-up duration for outcome assessment was 12 (6, 12·5) months. Fracture reduction was reported by 65 studies, with 16 (37%) graded as high quality, and 19 / 47 studies with a comparator group found a reduction in fractures. BMD change was reported by 73 studies, with 41 finding improved BMD. Implementation characteristics including reach, fidelity and loss to follow-up were under-reported, and consumer and clinician perspectives rare. Interpretation This comprehensive review of MoC for osteoporosis demonstrated inconsistent evidence for improving outcomes despite similar types of models. Future studies should include implementation outcomes, consumer and clinician perspectives, and fracture or BMD outcomes with sufficient duration of follow-up. Authors should consider pragmatic trial designs and co-design with clinicians and consumers.","Jones, Alicia R; Herath, Madhuni; Ebeling, Peter R; Teede, Helena; Vincent, Amanda J",EClinicalMedicine,18,11

The first two sections review ongoing responder health burdens and the tragic toll of this disaster from a worker safety and health perspective. The remaining sections address changes in federal infrastructure, response planning, and resources for protection of response and recovery personnel. Proper preparation includes pre-event and ""just-in-time"" disaster-worker training on likely hazards, organizational assets for hazard monitoring, and hands-on instruction in the use of assigned protective equipment. Good planning includes predeployment medical review to ensure ""fitness for duty"" and considers the following: (1) personal risk factors, (2) hazards likely to be associated with particular field locations, and (3) risks involved with assigned tasks (eg, workload and pace, work/rest cycles, available resources, and team/supervisory dynamics). Planning also should address worker health surveillance, medical monitoring, and availability of medical care (including mental health services). Disaster safety managers should anticipate likely hazards within planning scenarios and prepare asset inventories to facilitate making timely safety decisions. Disaster safety management begins immediately and provides ongoing real-time guidance to incident leadership at all levels of government. Robust standards must be met to reliably protect workers/responders. An integrated and measurable multiagency safety management function must be built into the incident command system before an incident occurs. This function delineates roles and responsibilities for rapid exposure assessments, ensuring cross-agency consistency in data interpretation, and timely, effective communication of information and control strategies. The ability to perform this safety management function should be tested and evaluated in exercise simulations and drills at multiple levels. Joint planning and exercising of the safety management plan and its function are effective ways to build interagency relationships and to be more systemic in managing logistics for safety equipment and converging personnel. Planning must include mechanisms to enable safety decisions to be implemented-such as effective and rapid scene control (site access), personnel tracking, and safety enforcement. Worker safety and health preparedness and leadership are essential for protecting workers and promoting resiliency among personnel involved in disaster response, recovery, and cleanup.","Reissman, Dori B; Howard, John","The Mount Sinai journal of medicine, New York",18,10

CASE REPORT A 28-year-old patient was referred for treatment of traumatic aortic transection with contained rupture at the level of an ARSA. Immediate thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) was planned because of hemodynamic instability. To achieve rapid sealing and maintain perfusion to both subclavian arteries, a chimney stent to the left subclavian artery (LSA) and a periscope stent-graft to the ARSA were deployed successfully. After surgical repair of all fractures, the patient was discharged 1 month after the initial injury in good condition. Imaging follow-up at 10 months showed a stable repair, patent parallel grafts, and no complications. CONCLUSION TEVAR with chimney and periscope grafts proved to be a safe and quick treatment for a patient requiring ARSA repair in acute aortic transection. This technique maintained blood flow to the ARSA and LSA in a totally endovascular approach, which could be very valuable in transection cases where bypass surgery to supra-aortic branches is compromised or deemed challenging due to thoracic wall and/or neck trauma. Parallel grafting can be a valuable tool to address any acute aortic pathology as it can be performed with off-the-shelf devices.","Vicente, Sandra; Glenck, Michael; Mayer, Dieter; Veith, Frank J; Lachat, Mario; Pecoraro, Felice",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,18,31

METHODS A total of 78 ISOA patients were recruited from April 6, 2020, to April 10, 2020, through a public call of University of Mons (Mons, Belgium). Patients benefited from nasopharyngeal swabs and fulfilled the patient-reported outcome questionnaire. Among them, 46 patients performed psychophysical olfactory evaluation using olfactory identification testing. Based on the duration of the ISOA, 2 groups of patients were compared: patients with olfactory dysfunction duration ≤12 days (group 1) and those with duration >12 days (group 2). RESULTS In group 1, 42 patients (87.5%) had a positive viral load determined by RT-PCR and 6 patients (12.5%) were negative. In group 2, 7 patients (23%) had a positive viral load and 23 patients (77%) were negative. The psychophysical olfactory evaluation reported that anosmia and hyposmia occurred in 24 (52%) and 11 (24%) patients, respectively. Eleven patients were normosmic. The viral load was significantly higher in patients of group 1 compared with those of group 2.

Our objective for the study was to report the prevalence of conduction anomalies in MIS-C and identify predictive factors for the conduction abnormalities. METHODS We performed a single-center retrospective cohort study of pediatric patients <21 years of age presenting with MIS-C over a 1-month period. We collected clinical outcomes, laboratory findings, and diagnostic studies, including serial electrocardiograms, in all patients with MIS-C to identify those with first-degree atrioventricular block (AVB) during the acute phase and assess for predictive factors. RESULTS Thirty-two patients met inclusion criteria. Median age at admission was 9 years. Six of 32 patients (19%) were found to have first-degree AVB, with a median longest PR interval of 225 milliseconds (interquartile range 200-302), compared with 140 milliseconds (interquartile range 80-178) in patients without first-degree AVB. The onset of AVB occurred at a median of 8 days after the initial symptoms and returned to normal 3 days thereafter. No patients developed advanced AVB, although 1 patient developed a PR interval >300 milliseconds. Another patient developed new-onset right bundle branch block, which resolved during hospitalization. Cardiac enzymes, inflammatory markers, and cardiac function were not associated with AVB development. CONCLUSIONS In our population, there is a 19% prevalence of first-degree AVB in patients with MIS-C. All patients with a prolonged PR interval recovered without progression to high-degree AVB. Patients admitted with MIS-C require close electrocardiogram monitoring during the acute phase.","Choi, Nak Hyun; Fremed, Michael; Starc, Thomas; Weller, Rachel; Cheung, Eva; Ferris, Anne; Silver, Eric S; Liberman, Leonardo",Pediatrics,18,1

Higher education institutions have a crucial role in the solution of public health problems by training young doctor candidates, and it is also essential to increase the knowledge level of physician candidates about the epidemic. So, in this study, we aimed to examine Turkish final year medical students' knowledge level, and perceptions towards the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS The present descriptive multicentered study was conducted with the medical students in the final year of six medical schools located in six geographic regions of Turkey. After ethical approval, data was gathered using an online questionnaire through Google forms between April 10, 2020, and April 20, 2020. RESULTS In this national survey study, 860 volunteers answered the questions thoroughly. The median age was 24 (22-38) years. 55.3% of the participants were female. The median knowledge level score was 69.0 (0-93.1). The knowledge level was moderate. 34.2% of the participants had a high level of knowledge. 48.7% of participants stated that they felt the most competent about performing CPR. Updates about COVID-19 were followed regularly by 84.5% of the participants. CONCLUSION We determined that final year medical students are knowledgeable and aware of this pandemic. We, medical educators, should inculcate relevant knowledge and educate the medical students to improve practices in the current pandemic, as well as for future epidemics.

Clinical observations have also highlighted that these patients have elevated von Willebrand factor (vWF) and factor VIIIc. METHODS 24 consecutive COVID-19 positive patients were selected from the intensive care unit (ICU) or the high acuity ward of Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust. RESULTS The rate of VTE was 25% and mortality rate was 16.7%. Fibrinogen and D-Dimers were elevated, 7.9 (1.6) g/L and 2.4 (2.02) ug/ml respectively. Factor VIIIc and von vWF antigen levels were both extremely elevated at 279 (148) u/dL and 350 (131) % respectively, which are comparable to levels seen in ICU patients with severe sepsis. vWF levels were significantly higher in patients that died (p=0.017) and showed a positive correlation with age. There was a statistically significant association between COVID-19 disease and non-O blood group (p=0.02); 80% (4/5) of COVID-19 patients with VTE were blood group A. CONCLUSION Very high levels of vWF and factor VIIIc are common in COVID-19 patients, comparable to levels in severely septic non-COVID ICU patients. This could contribute to the hypercoagulable state and increased VTE rate in COVID-19. Further studies are needed to evaluate the use of vWF for stratifying thrombotic risk in COVID-19 and to determine if elevated vWF is contributing to disease pathogenesis.","Ladikou, Eleni E; Sivaloganathan, Helena; Milne, Kate M; Arter, William E; Ramasamy, Roshan; Saad, Ramy; Stoneham, Simon M; Philips, Barbara; Eziefula, Alice C; Chevassut, Timothy",Clinical medicine,18,11

So far, viral targets of cellular immunity and factors determining successful mounting of T-cell responses are poorly defined. We therefore analyzed cellular responses to membrane, nucleocapsid and spike protein in individuals suffering from moderate or severe infection and after recovery from mild disease. We demonstrate that the CoV-2 specific CD4+ T-helper cell response is directed against all three proteins with comparable magnitude, ex vivo proliferation and portions of responding patients. However, deceased individuals were more frequently amongst non-responders. Higher patient age and comorbidity index correlated with increased frequencies of CoV-2 specific CD4+ T-cells, harboring higher portions of IL-2-, but lower portions of IFNγ secreting cells. Diminished frequencies of membrane protein reactive IFNγ+ T cells were particularly associated with higher Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II scores in patients admitted to intensive care.

These organelles have various other functions, all carried out by numerous proteins, with the majority of them being encoded by nuclear DNA (nDNA). Mitochondria occupy ~1/3 of the volume of myocardial cells in adults, and function at levels of high-efficiency to promptly meet the energy requirements of the myocardial contractile units. Mitochondria have their own DNA (mtDNA), which contains 37 genes and is maternally inherited. Over the last several years, a variety of functions of these organelles have been discovered and this has led to a growing interest in their involvement in various diseases, including cardiovascular (CV) diseases. Mitochondrial dysfunction relates to the status where mitochondria cannot meet the demands of a cell for ATP and there is an enhanced formation of reactive-oxygen species. This dysfunction may occur as a result of mtDNA and/or nDNA mutations, but also as a response to aging and various disease and environmental stresses, leading to the development of cardiomyopathies and other CV diseases. Designing mitochondria-targeted therapeutic strategies aiming to maintain or restore mitochondrial function has been a great challenge as a result of variable responses according to the etiology of the disorder. There have been several preclinical data on such therapies, but clinical studies are scarce. A major challenge relates to the techniques needed to eclectically deliver the therapeutic agents to cardiac tissues and to damaged mitochondria for successful clinical outcomes. All these issues and progress made over the last several years are herein reviewed.","Manolis, Antonis S; Manolis, Antonis A; Manolis, Theodora A; Apostolaki, Naomi E; Apostolopoulos, Evdoxia J; Melita, Helen; Katsiki, Niki",Medicinal research reviews,18,1

Several short term randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of bariatric procedures for inducing weight loss and initial remission of type 2 diabetes. Observational studies have linked bariatric procedures with long term improvements in body weight, type 2 diabetes, survival, cardiovascular events, incident cancer, and quality of life. Perioperative mortality for the average patient is low but varies greatly across subgroups. The incidence of major complications after surgery also varies widely, and emerging data show that some procedures are associated with a greater risk of substance misuse disorders, suicide, and nutritional deficiencies. More research is needed to enable long term outcomes to be compared across various procedures and subpopulations, and to identify those most likely to benefit from surgical intervention. Given uncertainties about the balance between the risks and benefits of bariatric surgery in the long term, the decision to undergo surgery should be based on a high quality shared decision making process.","Arterburn, David E; Courcoulas, Anita P",BMJ,18,1

Methods Sixty patients were included. They were stable asthmatics and were following up in the allergy clinic. Spirometry was conducted at pulmonary functions laboratory of Pediatric Allergy and Chest Unit of New Children's University Hospital, Cairo. The one-way analysis of variance was used to test the differences between groups. The Duncan multiple comparison test was used to test the significant differences between each pair of groups. Results The study found that sitting FEV1/FVC is significantly lower in overweight/obese asthmatic children compared to normal weight asthmatic children (p value=0.046).

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA COVID-19 emergency shocked national health systems, subtracting resources from treatment of other diseases. Its impact on surgical oncology is still to elucidate. METHODS A 56-question survey regarding the oncological surgical activity in Italy during the COVID-19 emergency was sent to referral centers for hepato-bilio-pancreatic, colorectal, esophago-gastric, and sarcoma/soft-tissue tumors. The survey portrays the situation 5 weeks after the first case of secondary transmission in Italy. RESULTS In total, 54 surgical Units in 36 Hospitals completed the survey (95%). After COVID-19 emergency, 70% of Units had reduction of hospital beds (median -50%) and 76% of surgical activity (median -50%). The number of surgical procedures decreased: 3.8 (interquartile range 2.7-5.4) per week before the emergency versus 2.6 (22-4.4) after (P = 0.036). In Lombardy, the most involved district, the number decreased from 3.9 to 2 procedures per week. The time interval between multidisciplinary discussion and surgery more than doubled: 7 (6-10) versus 3 (3-4) weeks (P < 0.001). Two-third (n = 34) of departments had repeat multidisciplinary discussion of patients. The commonest criteria to prioritize surgery were tumor biology (80%), time interval from neoadjuvant therapy (61%), risk of becoming unresectable (57%), and tumor-related symptoms (52%). Oncological hub-and-spoke program was planned in 29 departments, but was active only in 10 (19%). CONCLUSIONS This survey showed how surgical oncology suffered remarkable reduction of the activity resulting in doubled waiting-list. The oncological hub-and-spoke program did not work adequately. The reassessment of healthcare systems to better protect the oncological path seems a priority.","Torzilli, Guido; Vigano, Luca; Galvanin, Jacopo; Castoro, Carlo; Quagliuolo, Vittorio; Spinelli, Antonino; Zerbi, Alessandro; Donadon, Matteo; Montorsi, Marco",Annals of surgery,18,1

Here we developed a convergent synthetic pathway starting from a protected bromomethylcytosine derivative to synthesize transition state analogues of the DNA methyltransferases. This approach led to seven 5-methylcytosine-adenosine compounds that were, surprisingly, inactive against hDNMT1, hDNMT3Acat, TRDMT1 and other RNA human and viral methyltransferases. Interestingly, compound 4 and its derivative 2 showed an inhibitory activity against PRMT4 in the micromolar range. Crystal structures showed that compound 4 binds to the PRMT4 active site, displacing strongly the S-adenosyl-l-methionine cofactor, occupying its binding site, and interacting with the arginine substrate site through the cytosine moiety that probes the space filled by a substrate peptide methylation intermediate. Furthermore, the binding of the compounds induces important structural switches. These findings open new routes for the conception of new potent PRMT4 inhibitors based on the 5-methylcytosine-adenosine scaffold.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'Frontiers in epigenetic chemical biology'.","Halby, Ludovic; Marechal, Nils; Pechalrieu, Dany; Cura, Vincent; Franchini, Don-Marc; Faux, Céline; Alby, Fréderic; Troffer-Charlier, Nathalie; Kudithipudi, Srikanth; Jeltsch, Albert; Aouadi, Wahiba; Decroly, Etienne; Guillemot, Jean-Claude; Page, Patrick; Ferroud, Clotilde; Bonnefond, Luc; Guianvarc'h, Dominique; Cavarelli, Jean; Arimondo, Paola B","Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

METHODS Children requiring hospitalization for CAP were prospectively enrolled. The following indices were determined: antibodies against pneumococcal surface proteins (anti-PLY, pneumococcal histidine triad D, pneumococcal histidine triad E, LytB and pneumococcal choline-binding protein A), viral serology, nasopharyngeal cultures and polymerase chain reaction for 13 respiratory viruses, blood pneumococcal polymerase chain reaction, pneumococcal urinary antigen, PCT and CRP. Presumed pneumococcal CAP (P-CAP) was defined as a positive blood culture or polymerase chain reaction for Streptococcus pneumoniae or as a pneumococcal surface protein seroresponse (≥2-fold increase). RESULTS Seventy-five patients were included from which 37 (49%) met the criteria of P-CAP. Elevated PCT and CRP values were strongly associated with P-CAP with odds ratios of 23 (95% confidence interval: 5-117) for PCT and 19 (95% confidence interval: 5-75) for CRP in multivariate analysis. The sensitivity was 94.4% for PCT (cutoff: 1.5 ng/mL) and 91.9% for CRP (cutoff: 100 mg/L). A value≤0.5 ng/mL of PCT ruled out P-CAP in >90% of cases (negative likelihood ratio: 0.08). Conversely, a PCT value≥1.5 ng/mL associated with a positive pneumococcal urinary antigen had a diagnostic probability for P-CAP of almost 80% (positive likelihood ratio: 4.59). CONCLUSIONS PCT and CRP are reliable predictors of P-CAP. Low cutoff values of PCT allow identification of children at low risk of P-CAP. The association of elevated PCT or CRP with a positive pneumococcal urinary antigen is a strong predictor of P-CAP.","Galetto-Lacour, Annick; Alcoba, Gabriel; Posfay-Barbe, Klara M; Cevey-Macherel, Manon; Gehri, Mario; Ochs, Martina M; Brookes, Roger H; Siegrist, Claire-Anne; Gervaix, Alain",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,18,31

Although I have endeavored to cover all aspects of structural virology and to acknowledge relevant individuals, I know that I have favored taking examples from my own experience in telling this story. I am anxious to apologize to all those who I might have unintentionally offended by omitting their work. The first knowledge of virus structure was a result of Stanley's studies of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and the subsequent X-ray fiber diffraction analysis by Bernal and Fankuchen in the 1930s. At about the same time it became apparent that crystals of small RNA plant and animal viruses could diffract X-rays, demonstrating that viruses must have distinct and unique structures. More advances were made in the 1950s with the realization by Watson and Crick that viruses might have icosahedral symmetry. With the improvement of experimental and computational techniques in the 1970s, it became possible to determine the three-dimensional, near-atomic resolution structures of some small icosahedral plant and animal RNA viruses. It was a great surprise that the protecting capsids of the first virus structures to be determined had the same architecture. The capsid proteins of these viruses all had a 'jelly-roll' fold and, furthermore, the organization of the capsid protein in the virus were similar, suggesting a common ancestral virus from which many of today's viruses have evolved. By this time a more detailed structure of TMV had also been established, but both the architecture and capsid protein fold were quite different to that of the icosahedral viruses. The small icosahedral RNA virus structures were also informative of how and where cellular receptors, anti-viral compounds, and neutralizing antibodies bound to these viruses. However, larger lipid membrane enveloped viruses did not form sufficiently ordered crystals to obtain good X-ray diffraction. Starting in the 1990s, these enveloped viruses were studied by combining cryo-electron microscopy of the whole virus with X-ray crystallography of their protein components. These structures gave information on virus assembly, virus neutralization by antibodies, and virus fusion with and entry into the host cell. The same techniques were also employed in the study of complex bacteriophages that were too large to crystallize. Nevertheless, there still remained many pleomorphic, highly pathogenic viruses that lacked the icosahedral symmetry and homogeneity that had made the earlier structural investigations possible. Currently some of these viruses are starting to be studied by combining X-ray crystallography with cryo-electron tomography.","Rossmann, Michael G",Quarterly reviews of biophysics,18,19

As a consequence of their coevolution, viruses and host cells have established complex, dynamic interactions that function either in promoting virus replication and dissemination or in host defense against invading pathogens. Thus, viral infection triggers an impressive range of proteome changes. Alterations in protein abundances, interactions, posttranslational modifications, subcellular localizations, and secretion are temporally regulated during the progression of an infection. Consequently, understanding viral infection at the molecular level requires versatile approaches that afford both breadth and depth of analysis. Mass spectrometry is uniquely positioned to bridge this experimental dichotomy. Its application to both unbiased systems analyses and targeted, hypothesis-driven studies has accelerated discoveries in viral pathogenesis and host defense. Here, we review the contributions of mass spectrometry-based proteomic approaches to understanding viral morphogenesis, replication, and assembly and to characterizing host responses to infection.","Greco, Todd M; Diner, Benjamin A; Cristea, Ileana M",Annual review of virology,18,1

Literature in adults indicates that a 90° counterclockwise rotation (CCR) of the ETT before advancing results in smooth passage. We found no literature in children. OBJECTIVES Our aim was to study if a 90° counterclockwise rotation (CCR) of the ETT before advancement leads to smooth passage of the ETT into the larynx in children. METHODS Following IRB approval, we performed this study in two parts: Part 1: An unblinded, observational, pilot study on 20 children scheduled for oral rehabilitation where we concurrently used a fiberoptic scope nasally and GlideScope orally. We visualized the ETT path and observed that 90° CCR allowed smooth passage without hang up. Part 2: A blinded and randomized study on 40 children to confirm if 90° CCR from the outset would improve passage of the ETT during nasal intubation with a fiberoptic scope in children. All children were divided into two groups: group S, ETT bevel facing left; group R, ETT bevel facing down. RESULTS In Part 1, we observed that the ETT got hung up in 57% of children with standard bevel direction (facing left) and in 0% of children when prerotated. In Part 2, efficacy of prerotation was confirmed; the ETT got hung up in 50% of children in group S but in only 10.5% of children in group R. CONCLUSION A change in ETT tip orientation from bevel facing left to facing down by 90° CCR, leads to a significantly higher first-attempt success rate by nasal approach in children. We believe the ETT should be rotated before insertion into the nostril to ensure that full 90° CCR of the tip has been accomplished.","Choudhry, Dinesh K; Brenn, B Randall; Lutwin-Kawalec, Malgorzata; Sacks, Karen; Nesargi, Susmita; He, Zhaoping",Paediatric anaesthesia,18,1

METHODS A systematic assessment of literature articles was performed by searching in PubMed (MEDLINE), and major oncology meeting following PRISMA guidelines. RESULTS This review highlights the lack of literature. Indeed, most of the studies published were about influenza vaccination. Vaccination for patients under ICIs causes a humoral response and seems to be associated with an increase rate of seroconversion. Interestingly vaccination may provoke irAEs in ICIs-treated patients. So far, inactivated vaccines have not been contraindicated during ICI treatment.

The previous report has demonstrated that chitosan mediates the differentiation of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) through insulin-like growth factors and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-2 axis in an in vitro model. However, whether chitosan can further treat olfactory dysfunction in vivo remains unexplored. This study aims to evaluate the therapeutic effect of chitosan on a 3-methylindole-induced anosmic rat model. Intraperitoneal injection of 3-methylindole is performed to induce anosmia in rats. Experimental results demonstrate that the food-finding duration after chitosan treatment gradually decrease to around 80 s, and both the olfactory neuroepithelium (ON) thickness and mature ORNs (expressing olfactory marker protein) are significantly restored. Furthermore, proliferating cells (expressing bromodeoxyuridine) are mainly co-expressed with immature ORNs (expressing βIII tubulin) below the intermediate layer of the ON in the chitosan-treated group on day 28 following 3-methylindole treatment. Conversely, proliferating cells are scattered over the ON, and co-localized with immature ORNs and sustentacular cells (expressing keratin 18) in the sham group, and even immature ORNs go into apoptosis (expressing DNA fragmentation and cleaved caspase-3), possibly causing incomplete regeneration. Consequently, chitosan regenerates the ON by regulating olfactory neural homeostasis and reducing ORN apoptosis, and serves as a potential therapeutic intervention for olfactory dysfunction in the future.","Li, Sheng-Tien; Young, Tai-Horng; Huang, Tsung-Wei",Biomaterials,18,16

The escape room is one such innovative learner-focused activity, in which a team of players cooperatively discover clues, solve puzzles and complete tasks in order to progress through the challenge to achieve a specific goal. Escape rooms can be used in medical education as a tool for team building, an entertaining way of delivering technical and non-technical skills, to read and acquire or refresh knowledge, as well as for educational research. Despite appearing to be a superficial form of entertainment, escape rooms can be grounded in sound educational theory and, when used effectively, act as a low-cost, high-impact resource for a variety of learners. While escape rooms may well be an example of yet another educational 'fad' demonstrating the rising influence of 'Millennial MedEd', it signals a promising shift to more learner-centred, team-based methods which are essential to the practice of safe modern healthcare during the current COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.","Guckian, Jonathan; Eveson, Leanne; May, Hannah",Future healthcare journal,18,14

METHODS Laparoscopic dermoid cyst enucleation was performed in 35 cases of premenopausal patients placing the ovary in an endobag at the beginning of the procedure and removing the cyst from the abdominal cavity by the same endobag. RESULTS Dermoid cysts with a mean diameter of 6.3 ± 2.7 cm were enucleated and removed laparoscopically 'in a bag' without intra- or postoperative complications. Cyst rupture occurred in 10 cases (28.5%), but evident peritoneal contamination occurred in only 2 (5.7%; 95% confidence interval: 0.7-19.2%), because in 8 patients spillage was contained by the surrounding bag. The mean operative time was 64.6 ± 27 min. No signs or symptoms of peritonitis were observed. The mean postoperative hospitalization was 1.6 ± 1.4 days. Among the 12 infertile patients, 7 spontaneous pregnancies (58%) occurred. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic conservative excision of dermoid cysts placing the ovary in an endobag at the beginning of surgery and removing the cyst by the same bag is a safe and effective approach to reduce intraperitoneal spillage and operative time.","Campo, Sebastiano; Campo, Vincenzo",Gynecologic and obstetric investigation,18,19

In situ simulation has been proven an effective tool for training medical professionals during previous healthcare crises, eg, Ebola, influenza, as well as for assessing the preparedness of centers by identifying potential latent safety threats. In this article, we describe our ongoing simulation activities to ensure that our staff is best prepared to adapt to the challenges of COVID-19. METHODS This is a prospective preparedness assessment and training intervention at a tertiary care academic center in Lebanon during the COVID-19 pandemic. In situ simulations followed by debriefing with good judgment occur daily involving native teams of 3 to 5 professionals in the newly established COVID intensive care unit and wards, the adult and pediatric intensive care unit and wards, and the emergency department. The simulations are assessed by the instructor using the Simulation Team Assessment Tool and by the participants using the Simulation Effectiveness Tool. Transcripts of recorded simulation debriefings are analyzed for content for latent safety threats using the SHELL Framework (Software-Hardware-Equipment-Liveware). RESULTS In 2 weeks, we conducted 15 simulations with 106 participants and 47 observers. Simulation Team Assessment Tool scores show an overall improvement across the hospital over time [101.5 ± 13 (80-134)]. Participants' feedback on the Simulation Effectiveness Tool has been predominantly positive on the educational and practical benefits of the simulation activity. Data from debriefings and observations demonstrated the following categories of latent safety threats: inadequate preparedness on infection control, uncertainty of guidelines on oxygen supplementation and intubation protocols, lack of leadership and communication, overall panic, and others. CONCLUSIONS Our single-center preparedness intervention demonstrated multiple latent safety threats in relation to COVID-19, which can be recognized through simulation before translating into actual patient care.","Sharara-Chami, Rana; Sabouneh, Rami; Zeineddine, Rida; Banat, Rim; Fayad, Joe; Lakissian, Zavi",Simulation in healthcare : journal of the Society for Simulation in Healthcare,18,12

The aim of this study is to assess survival without incident cancer in a cohort of IBD patients exposed to anti-TNF while having previous malignancy within past 5 years. METHODS Data from IBD patients with previous malignancy diagnosed within the last 5 years before starting an anti-TNF agent were collected through a Groupe d'Etude Thérapeutiques des Affections Inflammatoires du tube Digestif multicenter survey. Inclusion date corresponded to the first anti-TNF administration after cancer diagnosis. RESULTS Twenty centers identified 79 cases of IBD patients with previous malignancy diagnosed 17 months (median; range: 1-65) before inclusion. The most frequent cancer locations were breast (n = 17) and skin (n = 15). After a median follow-up of 21 (range: 1-119) months, 15 (19%) patients developed incident cancer (8 recurrent and 7 new cancers), including 5 basal-cell carcinomas. Survival without incident cancer was 96%, 86%, and 66% at 1, 2, and 5 years, respectively. Crude incidence rate of cancer was 84.5 (95% CI, 83.1-85.8) per 1000 patient-years. CONCLUSIONS In a population of refractory IBD patients with recent malignancy, anti-TNF could be used taking into account a mild risk of incident cancer. Pending prospective and larger studies, a case-by-case joint decision taken with the oncologist is recommended for managing these patients in daily practice.","Poullenot, Florian; Seksik, Philippe; Beaugerie, Laurent; Amiot, Aurélien; Nachury, Maria; Abitbol, Vered; Stefanescu, Carmen; Reenaers, Catherine; Fumery, Mathurin; Pelletier, Anne-Laure; Nancey, Stephane; Peyrin-Biroulet, Laurent; Bourreille, Arnaud; Hébuterne, Xavier; Brixi, Hedia; Savoye, Guillaume; Lourenço, Nelson; Altwegg, Romain; Buisson, Anthony; Cazelles-Boudier, Christine; Racine, Antoine; Vergniol, Julien; Laharie, David",Inflammatory bowel diseases,18,1

The thoracoscopic approach is represented in the literature by a few reports, and multiple port incisions are observed in these studies. Aim To investigate the effectiveness and outcomes of the single port video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) method in the surgical treatment of bronchiectasis. To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting surgical treatment of bronchiectasis via the uniportal thoracoscopic approach. Material and methods The medical records of 15 patients undergoing surgery for bronchiectasis between 2013 and 2017 were reviewed. The patients were evaluated with regard to age, gender, duration of symptoms, localization, types and duration of the surgery, presence of pleural adhesion, intraoperative complications, amount of intraoperative bleeding, conversion to open surgery, postoperative drainage amount, chest tube removal time, length of hospital stay, mortality and morbidity, follow-up period, duration of narcotic analgesic usage, pain according to visual analog scale evaluation and satisfaction score. Results A total of 15 patients initially underwent single port thoracoscopic resection and 14 procedures were completed thoracoscopically. In terms of anatomic resections, 6 patients underwent left lower lobectomy, 4 right lower lobectomy, 1 right upper lobectomy, 1 left lower lobectomy + lingulectomy, 1 right basal segmentectomy and 1 patient underwent lingulectomy. The mean operative time was 137.1 ±24.5 min and the mean length of hospital stay was 4.78 ±1.52 days. The mean postoperative analgesic requirement was 2.85 ±0.66 days.

The systemic inflammatory response increases both pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine levels, leading to immune dysregulation and increasing the likelihood of incurring cardiac and pulmonary injuries. AREAS COVERED Longer periods of hospitalization (~20 days) increase susceptibility to ICU-acquired muscle weakness and deconditioning, which decreases muscle function and functional capacity. These conditions affect the quality of life in the post-COVID-19 period and requires multi-disciplinary approaches to rehabilitate the cardiopulmonary and musculoskeletal systems of these patients. In this context, this narrative review, which included articles published in the Embase, PEDro and PubMed databases up to December 2020, is focused on discussing the essential role of exercise and rehabilitation health professionals in the COVID-19 recovery process, from hospitalization to hospital discharge, addressing strategies for professionals to mitigate the cardiac and pulmonary impairments associated with hospitalization to home or ambulatory rehabilitation, purposing ways to conduct rehabilitation programs to restore their functional status and quality of life after the infection.

The regulation of autophagy has been elucidated through the combined study of yeast, Caenorhabditis elegans, mice, Drosophila melanogaster, and humans. MTOR, the major negative regulator of autophagy, and activating nutrient kinases, such as 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), interact with the autophagy regulatory complex: ULK1/2, RB1CC1, ATG13, and ATG101. The ULK1/2 complex induces autophagy by phosphorylating downstream autophagy complexes, such as the BECN1 PIK3 signaling complex that leads to the creation of LC3+ autophagosomes. We highlight in this review various reports of autophagy induction that are independent of these regulators. We discuss reports of MTOR-independent, AMPK-independent, ULK1/2-independent, and BECN1-PIK3C3-independent autophagy. We illustrate that autophagy induction and the components required vary by the nature of the induction signal and type of cell and do not always require canonical members of the autophagy signaling pathway. We illustrate that rather than thinking of autophagy as a linear pathway, it is better to think of autophagy induction as an interconnecting web of key regulators, many of which can induce autophagy through different requirements depending on the type and length of induction signals.","Corona Velazquez, Angel F; Jackson, William T",Molecular and cellular biology,18,8

One safety precaution has been the implementation of universal preoperative screening for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This study examines the results of universal screening on children undergoing orthopaedic surgery. METHODS This is a retrospective cohort study evaluating the incidence and symptomatology of COVID-19 in all patients presenting for orthopaedic surgery at 3 pediatric tertiary care children's hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic (March to June 2020). All patients underwent universal screening with a nasopharyngeal swab to detect presence of SARS-CoV-2. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors for positive COVID-19 screening. RESULTS In total, 1198 patients underwent preoperative screening across all 3 institutions and 7 (0.58%) had detection of SARS-CoV-2. The majority of patients (1/7, 86%) were asymptomatic. Patients that tested positive were significantly more likely to be Hispanic (P=0.046) and had greater number of medical comorbidities (P=0.013), as scored on the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status score. A known COVID-19 positive contact was found to be a significant risk factor in the multivariate analysis (P=0.004). CONCLUSIONS Early results of universal preoperative screening for COVID-19 demonstrates a low incidence and high rate of asymptomatic patients. Health care professionals, especially those at higher risk for the virus, should be aware of the challenges related to screening based solely on symptoms or travel history and consider universal screening for patients undergoing elective surgery.

Its evolution is unpredictable, making it hard for governments to provide response actions suited for all populations. Meanwhile, informal street workers carry on with their labor despite contingency measures to sustain their lives. The objective was to conduct a case-control study to become aware of how street vendors' economy is affected during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODOLOGY During phase 2 of the COVID-19 pandemic in a Mexican suburban city. We interviewed informal street vendors (cases) and formal employees (controls). RESULTS Before mobility restrictions were in place, population income came 1.5% from formal employment and 23.5% from informal employment (street vendors). Informal employees lived on less than the equivalent of 1.5 Big Macs per day (p <0.001). After the contingency measures, formal employment kept the same, while the informal employment ratio increased to 57.4% (p < 0.001). The street vendors were almost 100-times less likely to be concerned about the coronavirus outbreak (p < 0.001) and were 38-times less likely to stop working compared with the formal workers (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS We have proven that street vendors are a sector of the population that is highly vulnerable to significant economic loss due to contingency measures. Informal workers cannot stop working despite the ""Stay at Home"" initiative because the government has not implemented strategies that guarantee their survival and their families. Therefore, street vendors continue to be a source of the virus's spread throughout cities.","Romero-Michel, Jessica C; Mokay-Ramírez, Karen A; Delgado-Machuca, Marina; Delgado-Enciso, Josuel; Aurelien-Cabezas, Nomely S; Tiburcio-Jimenez, Daniel; Meza-Robles, Carmen; Delgado-Enciso, Osiris G; Guzman Esquivel, José; Zaizar-Fregoso, Sergio A; Martinez Fierro, Margarita L; Rodriguez Sanchez, Iram P; Melnikov, Valery; Barajas-Saucedo, Carlos E; Lara-Esqueda, Agustin; Delgado-Enciso, Ivan",Journal of infection in developing countries,18,1

However, retrospective studies suggest that some patients may have improved survival with local treatment of their liver metastases compared to systemic therapy alone. In the absence of randomized trials, it is important to identify patient characteristics indicating that benefit from local treatment can be expected. METHODS 59 patients undergoing radiofrequency ablation (RFA), interstitial brachytherapy (BT), or radioembolization (RE) of LMBC as a salvage treatment were studied. Potential factors influencing survival were analyzed in a multivariate Cox model. For factors identified to have an independent survival impact, Kaplan-Meier analysis and comparison of overall survival (OS) using the log-rank test was performed. RESULTS Median OS following local interventional treatment was 21.9 months. Considering only factors evaluable at treatment initiation, maximum diameter of liver metastases (≥3.9 cm; HR: 3.1), liver volume (≥ 1376 mL; HR: 2.3), and history of prior chemotherapy (≥ 3 lines of treatment; HR: 2.5-2.6) showed an independent survival impact. When follow-up data were included in the analysis, significant factors were maximum diameter of liver metastases (≥ 3.9 cm; HR: 3.1), control of LMBC during follow-up (HR: 0.29), and objective response as best overall response (HR: 0.21). Neither the presence of any extrahepatic metastases nor presence of bone metastases only had a significant survival impact. Median OS was 38.7 vs. 16.1 months in patients with metastases < vs. ≥ 3.9 cm, 36.6 vs. 10.2 months for patients having objective response vs. stable/progressive disease, and 38.5 vs. 14.2 months for patients having controlled vs. non-controlled disease at follow-up. CONCLUSION Local control of LMBC confers a survival benefit and local interventional treatment for LMBC should be studied in a randomized trial. Patients with small metastases and limited history of systemic LMBC treatment are most likely to benefit from local approaches. Limited extrahepatic disease should not lead to exclusion from a randomized study and should not be a contraindication for local LMBC treatment as long as no randomized data are available.","Seidensticker, Max; Garlipp, Benjamin; Scholz, Sophia; Mohnike, Konrad; Popp, Felix; Steffen, Ingo; Seidensticker, Ricarda; Stübs, Patrick; Pech, Maciej; PowerskI, Maciej; Hass, Peter; Costa, Serban-Dan; Amthauer, Holger; Bruns, Christiane; Ricke, Jens",BMC cancer,18,1

We analysed the 3c gene--a proposed virulence marker--in 27 FECV- and 28 FIPV-infected cats. Our findings suggest that functional 3c protein expression is crucial for FECV replication in the gut, but dispensable for systemic FIPV replication. Whilst intact in all FECVs, the 3c gene was mutated in the majority (71.4 %) of FIPVs, but not in all, implying that mutation in 3c is not the (single) cause of FIP. Most cats with FIP had no detectable intestinal feline coronaviruses (FCoVs) and had seemingly cleared the primary FECV infection. In those with detectable intestinal FCoV, the virus always had an intact 3c and seemed to have been acquired by FECV superinfection. Apparently, 3c-inactivated viruses replicate not at all--or only poorly--in the gut, explaining the rare incidence of FIP outbreaks.","Chang, Hui-Wen; de Groot, Raoul J; Egberink, Herman F; Rottier, Peter J M",The Journal of general virology,18,1

This study investigated the impact of direct versus nondirect transfers on the mortality rates of patients with sTBI. METHODS Data on patients with TBI admitted between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2013, to our Level I TC were obtained from the trauma registry. Data included patient age, sex, mechanism, and type of injury, comorbidities, Glasgow Coma Scale, Injury Severity scores, prehospital time, time to request and to transfer, time to initiation of multimodality monitoring and goal-directed therapy protocol, dwell time in the emergency department (EDT), and mortality. Data, reported in means ± standard deviation, were analyzed with the Student t-test and chi-square. Statistical significance was accepted at a P value < 0.05. RESULTS sTBI direct transfer to TC versus transfer from non-TCs (NTC): Of the 1187 patients with TBI admitted to our TC, 768 (64.7%) were admitted directly from the scene, whereas 419 (35.3%) were admitted after secondary transfer. One hundred seventy-one (22.2%) of the direct transfers had Glasgow Coma Scale < 8 (sTBI) and 92 (21.9%) of the secondary transfers had sTBI. The transfer time: Time from scene to arrival to the EDT was significantly shorter for TC versus NTCs 43 ± 14 versus 77 ± 26 min, respectively (P < 0.05). EDT dwell time before transfer and time from injury to arrival to TC were 4.2 ± 2.1 and 6.2 ± 8.3 h, respectively. Mortality: There was a statistically significant lower mortality for patients with sTBI transferred directly from the scene to TCs as opposed to patients secondarily transferred, 33/171 (19.3%) versus 33/92 (35.8%), respectively (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS To decrease TBI-related mortality, patients with suspected sTBI should be taken directly to a Level I or II TC unless they require life-saving stabilization at NTCs.","Prabhakaran, Kartik; Petrone, Patrizio; Lombardo, Gary; Stoller, Christy; Policastro, Anthony; Marini, Corrado P",The Journal of surgical research,18,1

Here, we examined whether differences in the endogenous opioid systems might be responsible for these differences. Rats received 6 weeks of chronic intermittent to 20% alcohol (v/v) or water-only from PND 26-66. Based on their consumption during the last 2 weeks of alcohol access, the alcohol-access rats were divided into high drinking (>2.5 g/kg/24-h) or low drinking (<2 g/kg/24-h). Rats were then given injections of the preferential mu opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone (1 mg/kg, s.c.) or the selective kappa opioid receptor antagonist LY2456302 (10 mg/kg, s.c.) prior to fear conditioning and were then tested for conditioned fear 2 days later. Pre-training naltrexone increased conditioned suppression of lever-pressing during training and testing, with no differences between high versus low alcohol drinkers or between water-only versus alcohol access groups (averaged across drinking levels). There was no effect of LY2456302 on conditioned fear in any comparison. We also found no differences between high and low alcohol drinkers and no reliable effect of prior alcohol access (averaged across drinking levels) on conditioned fear. Our experiment replicates and extends previous demonstrations that a preferential MOR antagonist can increase fear learning using conditioned suppression of lever-pressing as a fear measure.

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); the National Health Service (NHS) Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) databases (Health Technology Assessment (HTA) and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE)), in the Cochrane Library (Wiley); MEDLINE (Ovid); Embase (Elsevier); the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (EBSCOhost); and Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S) on Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics). We checked the reference lists of relevant systematic reviews for additional studies and also searched two clinical trial registers. We applied no language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adults with myocardial infarction, with angina, undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery or percutaneous coronary intervention, or with heart failure who were eligible for cardiac rehabilitation. Interventions had to aim to increase utilisation of comprehensive phase II cardiac rehabilitation. We included only studies that measured one or more of our primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes were harms and costs, and we focused on equity. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of all identified references for eligibility, and we obtained full papers of potentially relevant trials. Two review authors independently considered these trials for inclusion, assessed included studies for risk of bias, and extracted trial data independently. We resolved disagreements through consultation with a third review author. We performed random-effects meta-regression for each outcome and explored prespecified study characteristics. MAIN RESULTS Overall, we included 26 studies with 5299 participants (29 comparisons). Participants were primarily male (64.2%). Ten (38.5%) studies included patients with heart failure. We assessed most studies as having low or unclear risk of bias. Sixteen studies (3164 participants) reported interventions to improve enrolment in cardiac rehabilitation, 11 studies (2319 participants) reported interventions to improve adherence to cardiac rehabilitation, and seven studies (1567 participants) reported interventions to increase programme completion. Researchers tested a variety of interventions to increase utilisation of cardiac rehabilitation. In many studies, this consisted of contacts made by a healthcare provider during or shortly after an acute care hospitalisation.Low-quality evidence shows an effect of interventions on increasing programme enrolment (19 comparisons; risk ratio (RR) 1.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13 to 1.42). Meta-regression revealed that the intervention deliverer (nurse or allied healthcare provider; P = 0.02) and the delivery format (face-to-face; P = 0.01) were influential in increasing enrolment. Low-quality evidence shows interventions to increase adherence were effective (nine comparisons; standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.38, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.55), particularly when they were delivered remotely, such as in home-based programs (SMD 0.56, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.76). Moderate-quality evidence shows interventions to increase programme completion were also effective (eight comparisons; RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.25), but those applied in multi-centre studies were less effective than those given in single-centre studies, leading to questions regarding generalisability. A moderate level of statistical heterogeneity across intervention studies reflects heterogeneity in intervention approaches. There was no evidence of small-study bias for enrolment (insufficient studies to test for this in the other outcomes).With regard to secondary outcomes, no studies reported on harms associated with the interventions. Only two studies reported costs. In terms of equity, trialists tested interventions designed to improve utilisation among women and older patients. Evidence is insufficient for quantitative assessment of whether women-tailored programmes were associated with increased utilisation, and studies that assess motivating women are needed. For older participants, again while quantitative assessment could not be undertaken, peer navigation may improve enrolment. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Interventions may increase cardiac rehabilitation enrolment, adherence and completion; however the quality of evidence was low to moderate due to heterogeneity of the interventions used, among other factors. Effects on enrolment were larger in studies targeting healthcare providers, training nurses, or allied healthcare providers to intervene face-to-face; effects on adherence were larger in studies that tested remote interventions. More research is needed, particularly to discover the best ways to increase programme completion.","Santiago de Araújo Pio, Carolina; Chaves, Gabriela Ss; Davies, Philippa; Taylor, Rod S; Grace, Sherry L",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,18,1

The full genome of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has now been shared, and data have been gathered from several case series. As of February 11, 2020, there have been 45,182 laboratory-confirmed cases, the vast majority in China, with 1115 deaths, for an overall case-fatality rate of 2.5%. Cases have been confirmed in 27 countries. On average, each patient infects 2.2 other people. Symptomatic infection appears to predominantly affect adults, with a 5-day estimated incubation period between infection and symptom onset. The most common presenting symptoms are fever, cough, dyspnea, and myalgias and/or fatigue. All cases reported to date have shown radiographic evidence of pneumonia. 2019-nCoV is diagnosed by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Treatment is largely supportive, with regimens including antiviral therapy. Corticosteroids are not routinely recommended.

SARS-CoV-2 has a polybasic insertion (PRRAR) at the S1/S2 cleavage site that can be cleaved by furin. Using lentiviral pseudotypes and a cell-culture-adapted SARS-CoV-2 virus with an S1/S2 deletion, we show that the polybasic insertion endows SARS-CoV-2 with a selective advantage in lung cells and primary human airway epithelial cells, but impairs replication in Vero E6, a cell line used for passaging SARS-CoV-2. Using engineered spike variants and live virus competition assays and by measuring growth kinetics, we find that the selective advantage in lung and primary human airway epithelial cells depends on the expression of the cell surface protease TMPRSS2, which enables endosome-independent virus entry by a route that avoids antiviral IFITM proteins. SARS-CoV-2 virus lacking the S1/S2 furin cleavage site was shed to lower titres from infected ferrets and was not transmitted to cohoused sentinel animals, unlike wild-type virus. Analysis of 100,000 SARS-CoV-2 sequences derived from patients and 24 human postmortem tissues showed low frequencies of naturally occurring mutants that harbour deletions at the polybasic site. Taken together, our findings reveal that the furin cleavage site is an important determinant of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","Peacock, Thomas P; Goldhill, Daniel H; Zhou, Jie; Baillon, Laury; Frise, Rebecca; Swann, Olivia C; Kugathasan, Ruthiran; Penn, Rebecca; Brown, Jonathan C; Sanchez-David, Raul Y; Braga, Luca; Williamson, Maia Kavanagh; Hassard, Jack A; Staller, Ecco; Hanley, Brian; Osborn, Michael; Giacca, Mauro; Davidson, Andrew D; Matthews, David A; Barclay, Wendy S",Nature microbiology,18,16

However, the role of a teacher is equally vital in shaping students' career preference. OBJECTIVE This study therefore explored students' perspectives of their gerontological nurse teachers' abilities and its association with students' willingness to work in older people nursing. DESIGN A cross-sectional correlation study. SETTING Five Universities of Applied Sciences in Finland. PARTICIPANTS Undergraduate nursing students (N = 243). METHOD A self-administered survey using the Gerontological Nurse Teacher Scale (GeNTS) and the subscale (Willingness) of the Students' Interest in Nursing Older People Scale (SINOPS). Descriptive and inferential analysis were conducted using SPSS. RESULTS There was a moderate positive association (R = 0.25, N = 243, p = 0.000) between students' perspectives of their gerontological nurse teachers' abilities and students' willingness to work in older people nursing. The teachers' abilities to develop gerontological nursing course most influence students' willingness in older people nursing (r = 0.26, p = 0.001), whereas their knowledge and interest in gerontology, least influenced students' willingness in older people nursing (r = 0.14, p = 0.025). Also, the teachers abilities to address students' concerns about aging, promote gerontology careers, and demonstrate leadership skills in gerontology all had a similar statistically significant moderate positive association (r = 0.23, p = 0.001) with students' willingness to work in older people nursing. CONCLUSION Faculty need to ensure that there is adequate personal with expertise in gerontological nursing to advocate for resources to establish a reputable gerontological nursing profile in nursing curriculum and to develop and sustain a positive attitude towards older people nursing among students and staff. A qualitative study is needed to understand the reasons behind students' ratings.","Garbrah, William; Kankkunen, Päivi; Välimäki, Tarja",Nurse education today,18,10

Intra-abdominal drains are frequently positioned adjacent to the pancreatic anastomosis or transection margin at the time of surgery to aid in detection and management of CR-POPF. Drains can either evacuate fluid by passive gravity (PG) or be attached to a closed suction (CS) system using negative pressure. There is controversy as to whether one of these two systems is superior. The objective of this review is to identify and compare the incidence of adverse events (AEs) and resource utilisation associated with PG and CS drainage following pancreatic resections. METHODS AND ANALYSIS MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials will be searched from inception to April 2019, to identify interventional and observational studies comparing PG and CS drains following pancreatic resection. The primary outcome is POPF as defined by the International Study Group for Pancreatic Fistula in 2017. Secondary outcomes include postoperative AE, resource utilisation (length of stay, return to emergency department, readmission and reintervention), time to drain removal and quality of life. Study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment will be performed independently, by two reviewers. A meta-analysis will be conducted if deemed statistically appropriate. Subgroup analysis by study design will be performed. Study heterogeneity will be calculated with the χ2 test and reported as I2 statistics.

Method: In Study 1, we describe the development and validation of the instrument, through an iterative procedure in which manual annotation of independent subsamples (n = 24, 25) by human coders was compared to the computer coding in subsequent rounds, until sufficient agreement was reached. In Study 2, we illustrate the type of data that the script generates, by analyzing the prevalence of the three perspectives in annual reports of 55 Dutch organizations over a period of 2 decades (1999-2018; n = 937). Results: Our findings confirm that DivPAR is sufficiently reliable for use in future research. In Study 2, we show that among Dutch organizations, the moral perspective is most prevalent, but the market and innovation perspectives are increasing in popularity. Conclusion: DivPAR can be used to analyze the prevalence and longitudinal development of diversity perspectives in organizational communication. It enables scholars to draw comparisons across different sectors, regions, or countries, to study how diversity perspectives correlate with societal developments, and to uncover the (lack of) relationships between diversity communication and diversity outcomes.

Medline/PubMed publication databases were searched for RCTs of oral drugs used as monotherapy for the treatment of BPD, published between January 1980 and September 2013. Data extracted from 12 manuscripts and one poster, representing a total of 17 clinical trials, were pooled. Pooled response rates for drug and placebo were 55.1 and 39.2%, corresponding to a risk ratio for responding to active treatment versus placebo of 1.29 (P<0.001). The probability of receiving placebo and trial duration correlated with the response rate to placebo. A meta-regression showed that trial duration and baseline severity correlated with the risk ratio of responding to drug versus placebo. There was a trend toward statistical significance for a greater probability of receiving placebo to predict greater drug-placebo 'separation'. In conclusion, several modifiable factors, specifically the probability of receiving placebo, baseline illness severity, and trial duration, correlate with placebo response rates and/or clinical trial outcome in RCTs of pharmacotherapy for BPD, and should be taken into account when designing studies for BPD.","Nierenberg, Andrew A; Østergaard, Søren D; Iovieno, Nadia; Walker, Rosemary S W; Fava, Maurizio; Papakostas, George I",International clinical psychopharmacology,18,1

METHODS This Western Australian, whole-jurisdictional linked-data, retrospective cohort study compared maternal and neonatal outcomes of first postcancer pregnancies among women CRC survivors against randomly selected pregnancies of women with no cancer history. Logistic regression models were used to investigate a range of adverse outcomes independently associated with CRC and its surgical and adjunctive treatments. RESULTS Among 627,762 deliveries during the study period (1983-2007), 232 were first pregnancies following CRC. Whether following laparoscopic or open cancer surgery, these pregnancies were independently associated with a significantly increased risk of antepartum hemorrhage [odds ratios (ORs): 1.25; 2.13 for the respective procedures], postpartum hemorrhage (ORs: 1.61; 3.31), Cesarean delivery (ORs: 2.42; 4.24), infant low Apgar score (ORs: 1.32; 2.64), need for neonatal resuscitation (ORs: 1.49; 3.20), and special care admission (ORs: 1.42; 2.87). A history of open (but not laparoscopic) cancer surgery was associated with increased risk of gastrointestinal obstruction during pregnancy (OR 1.17) and prolonged postpartum hospitalization (OR 3.11). Neither was significantly associated with perinatal death. Among women with previous CRC, rectal (versus colonic) malignancy was independently associated with a significantly higher risk of overall maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes (ORs: 3.73 and 2.73, respectively), as was radiotherapy (ORs: 4.24 and 2.81, respectively). Chemotherapy was independently associated with a marginally but significantly higher risk of overall maternal but not neonatal outcomes (ORs: 1.11; 0.98). Open versus laparoscopic cancer surgery was associated with a significantly higher risk of antepartum and postpartum hemorrhage, low Apgar score, need for neonatal resuscitation, and neonatal special care admission. CONCLUSIONS Previous CRCs, particularly rectal and radiation-treated tumors, appear to confer an increased likelihood of adverse outcomes in subsequent pregnancies. Laparoscopic technique for CRC surgery may reduce adverse gestational outcomes.","Haggar, Fatima; Pereira, Gavin; Preen, David; Woods, John; Martel, Guillaume; Boushey, Robin; Mamazza, Joseph; Einarsdottir, Kristjana",Surgical endoscopy,18,17

Methods: From January 20, 2020 to February 8, 141 COVID-19 patients in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, 77 males and 64 females, with a median age of 49 (9,87) , were retrospectively analyzed. The clinical features, laboratory examination indexes and HRCT evolution findings of 141 COVID-19 patients were analyzed. Results: Laboratory examinations of 141 COVID-19 patients showed a decrease in white blood cell count and lymphocyte ratio. Among the 141 patients with COVID-19, fever (>37.5 ℃) was the most common clinical manifestation in 139 cases (98.58%) , and occasionally non-respiratory symptoms such as diarrhea in 4 cases (2.84%) . 141 patients with COVID-19 had abnormal HRCT. 52 (36.88%) chest HRCT images showed ground-glass opacity (GGO) , mainly under pleural; 23 (16.31%) GGO with focal consolidation; 27 (19.15%) small flaky shadows; 20 cases (14.18%) large flaky consolidation shadows; 48 cases (34.04%) bronchovascular bundle thickening and vascular penetrating signs; 5 cases (3.55%) had air bronchial signs; 7 cases (4.96%) of small nodule shadows; 5 cases (3.55%) of fibrosis, grid shadows or strand shadows.135 cases (95.74%) were positive for the first time nucleic acid test, 6 cases (4.26%) were negative, and 71 cases (50.35%) of common type, 47 cases (33.33%) of severe type and 23 cases (16.31%) of critical type were found during the same period. The average time from onset of each type to the first CT examination was: (2.51±1.32) , (5.02±2.01) , and (5.91±1.76) days; 19 (19/47, 40.43%) of which were severe for the first time CT classification worsened at the second examination and lessened at the third examination. 141 cases (100%) were positive for the second nucleic acid test, and the HRCT results for the same period were 44 cases (31.21%) of common type, 53 cases (37.59%) of severe type, and 44 cases (31.21%) of critical type; the average interval time was (3.32±1.61) , (3.93±1.84) , (4.15±1.57) days;the third nucleic acid test were positive among 113 cases and 28 cases were negative, HRCT results of the same period were 79 cases (56.03%) of common type, 46 cases (32.62%) of severe type, and 16 cases (11.35%) of critical type;the average interval from the first CT examination were: (5.59±1.83) , (7.32±1.37) , (7.55±1.78) days. The differences in CT typing at different time were statistically significant (P<0.05) . Conclusion: The clinical features of COVID-19 and HRCT images are diverse, extensive GGO and infiltrates in both lungs are typical. Viral nucleic acid tests usually occur earlier or at the same time as the CT examination positive, and there are false negatives in nucleic acid tests. In some epidemiological backgrounds, CT imaging manifestations and evolutionary characteristics are of great significance for early warning of lung injury, assessment of disease severity, and assistance in clinical typing and post-treatment follow-up.","Lu, X F; Gong, W; Wang, L; Li, L; Xie, B J; Peng, Z F; Zha, Y F",Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases,18,24

In temperate regions, there is a large seasonal rise in influenza and other respiratory pathogens. We have examined the associations between individual pathogens and reported respiratory tract infections to estimate attributable burden. We used multiple linear regression to model the relationship between doctor consultation data and laboratory samples from week 3 2011 until week 37 2015. We fitted separate models for consultation data with in-hours and out-of-hours doctor services, stratified by different age bands. The best fitting all ages models (R2 > 80%) for consultation data resulted in the greatest burden being associated with influenza followed by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). For models of adult age bands, there were significant associations between consultation data and invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae. There were also smaller numbers of consultations significantly associated with rhinovirus, parainfluenza, and human metapneumovirus. We estimate that a general practice with 10 000 patients would have seen an additional 18 respiratory tract infection consultations per winter week of which six had influenza and four had RSV. Our results are important for the planning of health care services to minimise the impact of winter pressures. •Respiratory pathogen incidence explains over 80% of seasonal variation in respiratory consultation data.•Influenza and RSV are associated with the biggest seasonal rises in respiratory consultation counts.•A third of consultation counts associated with respiratory pathogens were due to influenza.","Morbey, R A; Elliot, A J; Harcourt, S; Smith, S; de Lusignan, S; Pebody, R; Yeates, A; Zambon, M; Smith, G E",Epidemiology and infection,18,1

To date, the mechanisms enabling these host shifts remain incompletely understood. Here, we show that a host factor, human TRA2A (huTRA2A), inhibits avian IAV replication, but benefits human IAV replication by altered regulation of viral messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing. huTRA2A depresses mRNA splicing by binding to the intronic splicing silencer motif in the M mRNA of representative avian YS/H5N1 or in the NS mRNA of representative human PR8/H1N1 virus, leading to completely opposite effects on replication of the human and avian viruses in vitro and in vivo. We also confirm that the M-334 site and NS-234/236 sites are critical for TRA2A binding, mRNA splicing, viral replication, and pathogenicity. Our results reveal the underlying mechanisms of adaptation of avian influenza virus to human hosts, and suggest rational strategies to protect public health.","Zhu, Yinxing; Wang, Ruifang; Yu, Luyao; Sun, Huimin; Tian, Shan; Li, Peng; Jin, Meilin; Chen, Huanchun; Ma, Wenjun; Zhou, Hongbo",Science advances,18,28

This study aimed to understand the prevalence of HBV infection, susceptibility and immunity due to immunisation among a high-risk population of MSM and heterosexuals who are less likely to attend sexual health services. METHODS Residual HIV-negative serology samples archived from a national HIV self-sampling service in 2016 were tested for HBV markers using an unlinked anonymous approach. Prevalence of HBV infection, evidence of immunisation and susceptibility were calculated and stratified by individuals' characteristics. Multinomial logistic regression was used to estimate relative risk ratios (RRRs) associated with covariates. RESULTS Of 2172 samples tested, 1497 (68.9%) were from MSM and 657 (30.2%) were from heterosexuals. Susceptibility to HBV infection was 66.1% among MSM and 77.0% among heterosexuals. Only 29.9% of MSM and 17.4% of heterosexuals had serological evidence of immunisation. Current infection was 1.1% in heterosexuals and 0.2% in MSM. Adjusted analysis showed evidence of immunisation was lower among heterosexuals (RRR 0.66, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.86) and those with no previous HIV test (RRR 0.41, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.54), and higher in those of other white or other ethnicity. CONCLUSIONS Among MSM and heterosexual users of a self-sampling HIV service, evidence of immunisation to HBV infection was low and susceptibility to infection was comparatively high, suggesting suboptimal delivery of HBV immunisation in sexual health services.","Roche, Rachel; Simmons, Ruth; Logan, Louise; Ledesma, Juan; Sabin, Caroline; Ijaz, Samreen; Mandal, Sema",Sexually transmitted infections,18,12

Embolization targets have expanded to include angiographic cure. Methods To discuss the technical and management outcomes of our first cerebral AVM case series treated with embolization. The clinical, angiographic, treatment, and outcome variables of consecutive cerebral arteriovenous malformation cases, treated with curative embolization, between January 2011 and June 2017 in one regional center, were retrospectively analyzed. Results In 21 patients, 21 AVMs were identified, and 13 patients (61.9%) were males. The mean of the age was 34.24 ± 12.99. Fifteen patients (71.4%) had a history of intracranial hemorrhage, and 10 (47.6%) patients had seizures. Sixteen patients (76.2%) were at grade 1 of modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at admission. The median for modal Spetzler-Martin grade was 2. The average number of arterial feeders was 3. Direct arteriovenous fistulas were found in 4 cases (19.0%). Venous aneurysms were found in 4 cases (19.0%). Seventeen AVMs (80.9%) were considered high bleeding risk lesions. Forty-three embolization sessions were done. Early hemorrhage occurred in 3 sessions (7.0%). Vessel perforation occurred 1 session (2.3%). Poor outcome occurred in 1 patient that was discharged at grade 3 mRS. Angiographic cure was achieved in 9 patients (42.9%). The average size reduction was 65%.

Pathogenesis can be derived from infection, coagulopathy, and inflammation. Malignant tumors metastasize to dura mater is one of the most infrequent causes. The exact mechanism remains elusive in spite of several possible speculations. The clinical manifestations, management and outcomes vary among reported cases.CASE DESCRIPTION: A 45-year-old woman without history of trauma presented with headache, vomiting and disturbance of consciousness and developed brain hernia rapidly. On arival, she has lost into coma with Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score 5, bilateral pupils were not equal, with disappeared reflectance. Emergency imaging prompted large acute EDH, combined with SDH, arising from dural granular neoplasm confirmed intraoperatively. Four days after surgery, the bilateral pupils were equal in size and sensitive to light reflection.CONCLUSION: Dural metastases can cause EDH, chronic SDH can also be resulted from metastatic tumors of dura mater. When dealing with spontaneous non-traumatic hematoma around the dura mater, to make the precise diagnosis is sometimes doubtful and confusing. The stream of diagnostic thinking should be opened, including medical diseases such as liver and kidney disease, drug history, history of cancer and other possible clues. Thus, a detailed and purposeful systematic medical history review and physical examination is important in order to make more appropriate strategies for the clinic.","Chenhui, Zhao; Yi, Wei; Jie, Liu; Shanshui, Xu; Xiaochun, Jiang; Di, Guangfu",The International journal of neuroscience,18,5

METHODS In vitro, destructive materials testing was used. By adhering to the American Standard for Testing and Materials standards for testing of suture materials, slip knots were compared with 3-1-1 knots using 10-0 nylon suture material. Tensile testing was performed on each knot type using the Instron Microtester (Model 5848 Norwood, MA). Scanning electron microscopy was used to analyze all sutures tested to failure. The main outcome measure was the maximum load (newtons) or ultimate tensile strength before which each knot failed by breakage or by unraveling. RESULTS The mean force resulting in failure by breakage of the 3-1-1 knot and slip knot was 0.71 and 0.64 N, respectively (P = 0.048). The mean force resulting in failure by the unraveling of the 3-1-1 knot and slip knot was 0.48 and 0.37 N, respectively (P = 0.022). CONCLUSIONS In 10-0 nylon sutures, the 3-1-1 knot has a statistically significant greater tensile strength than the slip knot has in conditions wherein they fail by either breakage or unraveling.","Lutchman, Carla R; Leung, Linus H; Moineddin, Rahim; Chew, Hall F",Cornea,18,31

MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a retrospective analysis of on-site patients with brain tumors. Fifty-nine patients received only gadobutrol, and 60 patients received only linear gadolinium-based contrast agents. Linear gadolinium-based contrast agents included gadoversetamide, gadobenate dimeglumine, and gadodiamide. T1 signal intensity in the globus pallidus, dentate nucleus, and pons was measured on the precontrast portions of patients' first and seventh brain MRIs. Ratios of signal intensity comparing the globus pallidus with the pons (globus pallidus/pons) and dentate nucleus with the pons (dentate nucleus/pons) were calculated. Changes in the above signal intensity ratios were compared within the gadobutrol and linear agent groups, as well as between groups. RESULTS The dentate nucleus/pons signal ratio increased in the linear gadolinium-based contrast agent group (t = 4.215, P < .001), while no significant increase was seen in the gadobutrol group (t = -1.422, P = .08). The globus pallidus/pons ratios followed similarly, with an increase in the linear gadolinium-based contrast agent group (t = 2.931, P < .0001) and no significant change in those receiving gadobutrol (t = 0.684, P = .25). CONCLUSIONS Successive doses of gadobutrol do not result in T1 shortening compared with changes seen in linear gadolinium-based contrast agents.","Moser, F G; Watterson, C T; Weiss, S; Austin, M; Mirocha, J; Prasad, R; Wang, J",AJNR.

BACKGROUND COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease caused by a severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Healthy pregnant women are more susceptible to developing COVID-19. METHODS We reviewed clinical data from pregnant patients with a laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2, who were admitted to two tertiary care hospitals in Turkey. Demographic, clinical characteristics, laboratory test results, imaging findings, treatment received, maternal and neonatal outcomes were collected. RESULTS A total of 24 pregnant women were enrolled in this study. The mean maternal and gestational age was 26.9±5.37 years and 24.15±10.61 weeks, respectively. Cough was observed as the most common symptom (n=15; 62.5 %). The lowest lymphocyte percentage was 20.83±13.05 (%). Nine women have delivered by Caesarean section, while one had a vaginal birth. One woman with critical COVID-19 died 2 days later postpartum. The neonate had been transferred to neonatal intensive care unit and died within 24 hours of birth. CONCLUSION Our findings showed that except for one patient, the clinical course of COVID-19 during pregnancy was mild. Early hospitalization of pregnant women with confirmed and suspected COVID-19, liberal testing for SARS-CoV-2, active management with a multidisciplinary team seemed to be critical to recovery (Tab. 3, Ref. 31).","Ozsurmeli, M; Terzi, H; Hocaoglu, M; Bilir, R A; Gunay, T; Unsal, D; Turgut, A; Karateke, A",Bratislavske lekarske listy,18,16

Environmental gradients, whether natural (e.g., latitude, elevation, ocean proximity) or anthropogenic (e.g., land-use intensity, urbanization), provide compelling settings for addressing this challenge. However, not all organisms are amenable to the observational and experimental approaches required for untangling the factors that structure species along gradients. Here we highlight herbaceous plants in the genus Plantago as models for studying the ecology and evolution of species interactions along abiotic gradients. Plantago lanceolata and P. major are native to Europe and Asia but distributed globally, and they are established models for studying population ecology and interactions with herbivores, pathogens, and soil microbes. Studying restricted range congeners in comparison with those cosmopolitan species can provide insight into abiotic and biotic determinants of range size and population structure. We highlight one such species, P. rugelii, which is endemic to eastern North America. We give an overview of the literature on these focal Plantago species and explain why they are logical candidates for studies of species interactions across environmental gradients. Finally, we emphasize collaborative and community science approaches that can facilitate such research and note the amenability of Plantago for authentic research projects in science education.","Penczykowski, Rachel M; Sieg, R Drew",The American naturalist,18,0

Some signaling pathways downstream of a GPCR may be responsible for drug adverse effects while others mediate therapeutic efficacy. Biased ligands preferentially activate only a subset of all GPCR signaling pathways. They hold great potential to become next-generation GPCR drugs with less side effects due to their potential to exclusively activate desired signaling pathways. However, the molecular basis of biased agonism is poorly understood. GPCR activation occurs through allosteric coupling, the propagation of conformational changes from the extracellular ligand binding pocket to the intracellular G protein-binding interface. Comparison of GPCR structures in complex with G proteins or β-arrestin reveals that intracellular transducer coupling results in closure of the ligand binding pocket trapping the agonist inside its binding site. Allosteric coupling appears to be transducer-specific offering the possibility of harnessing this mechanism for the design of biased ligands. Here, we review the biochemical, pharmacological, structural and biophysical evidence for allosteric coupling and delineate that biased agonism should be a consequence of preferential allosteric coupling from the ligand binding pocket to one transducer binding site. As transducer binding leads to large structural rearrangements in the extracellular ligand binding pocket, we survey biased ligands with an extended binding mode that interact with extracellular receptor domains. We propose that biased ligands use ligand-specific triggers inside the binding pocket that are relayed through preferential allosteric coupling to a specific transducer, eventually leading to biased signaling.","Bock, Andreas; Bermudez, Marcel",The FEBS journal,18,6

Perfluorobutane-contrast enhanced US (pCEUS) is a promising tool that may allow for targeting of tumours that are otherwise imperceptible on greyscale US. Although pCEUS has been reported to be effective, the literature has been limited outside of Japan and South Korea. We aimed to provide data that supports the use of pCEUS in thermal ablation of sonographically occult liver tumours. METHODS We conducted a retrospective single-centre study of 35 consecutive patients who underwent pCEUS-guided ablation of 48 liver tumours with a median size of 1.2 cm. Periprocedural, one-month post-treatment, and relevant follow-up imaging studies were reviewed. Electronic records were also obtained, with long-term follow-up data of 12-28 months being available for 32 patients. RESULTS 36 (75%) of tumours that were imperceptible on greyscale US became visible with pCEUS. Overall, complete tumour ablation at one month was 89%. 1 (3%) patient developed a major complication following treatment, while 6 (17%) had minor post-treatment complaints. The local tumour progression rate was 17% with a median time of 14 months. CONCLUSION pCEUS has a role in US-guided thermal ablation of liver tumours, offering a high technical success rate that is comparable to reported data. Additional benefits may include improved procedural time and freedom from ionising radiation.","Shi, Haiyuan; Ong, Yi-Ting; Gogna, Apoorva; Venkatanarasimha, Nanda; Sanamandra, Sarat Kumar; Leong, Sum; Irani, Farah Gillan; Lo, Richard Hoau Gong; Too, Chow Wei",Singapore medical journal,18,16

E-learning is an accessible and scalable method of delivering health professional education. The PEAK (Physiotherapy Exercise and physical Activity for Knee osteoarthritis) e-learning modules were developed to upskill physiotherapists in evidence-based management of knee osteoarthritis (OA) via telehealth and in-person. In the research setting, the PEAK e-learning modules are perceived by physiotherapists as effective when part of a comprehensive training program for a clinical trial. However, effectiveness of the PEAK modules on their own, in a 'real-world' setting, is unknown. OBJECTIVE Evaluate reach, effectiveness, adoption and implementation of the PEAK e-learning modules. METHODS This is a longitudinal study informed by the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. Participants were clinicians, researchers, educators and healthcare students who registered for access to the modules between April 1st and November 30th 2020. Reach was evaluated by outcomes (countries; referral sources; attrition) extracted from registration data and embedded within pre-course surveys in the Learning Management System (LMS). Effectiveness was evaluated by outcomes (confidence with video-conferencing; likelihood to use education, strengthening exercise and physical activity in a treatment plan for knee OA; usefulness of modules) measured via 10-point numeric rating scales (NRS; score range from 1=not confident/likely/useful at all to 10=extremely confident/likely/useful) in pre- and post-course (upon completion) surveys in the LMS. Adoption and implementation were evaluated by demographic and professional characteristics and outcomes related to use of learnings and usefulness of program elements (measured via 4-point Likert scales (response options from not at all useful to extremely useful)) in a survey administered four months after module completion. RESULTS Broad reach occurred, with 6720 people from 97 countries registering for access. Amongst registrants, there were high levels of attrition, with 2463 (37%) commencing the program and pre-course survey and 1318 (20%) completing all modules and post-course survey. The program was effective. Learners who completed the modules demonstrated increased confidence with video-conferencing (mean change (95% CI) 3.1 (3.0, 3.3) NRS units), and increased likelihood to use education, strengthening and physical activity in a knee OA treatment plan, compared to pre-course. Adoption and implementation of learnings (n= 149 respondents) occurred at 4 months. More than half of respondents used their learnings to structure in-person consultations with patients (56%) and the patient information booklets in their clinical practice (53%). CONCLUSIONS This study provides evidence of reach and effectiveness of an asynchronous self-directed e-learning program in a real-world setting amongst physiotherapists. The PEAK e-learning modules offer clinicians an accessible educational course to learn about best-practice knee OA management, including telehealth delivery via video-conferencing. Attrition across the e-learning program highlight the challenges of keeping learners engaged with self-directed online learning.

National governments have applied different mitigating strategies like the implementation of strict closures. In response to pandemic situations, normally governments tell people what to do with minimal community input. This study argues that local community organizations have an important role in practical information sharing and health literacy in a pandemic situation. Although pandemics like COVID-19 do not create physical destruction to disrupt the information stream, there is a concern that poor health literacy and information gaps can significantly contribute to the rapid spread of uncertainty, fear, and anxiety. This paper emphasizes the potential role of community workers in the dissemination of transparent and honest communication at the grassroots level. This information sharing is critical because more informed communities are more receptive to the implementation of the prescribed preventive measures. National governments need to make sure that the requisite enabling and reinforcing structures are in place to fully leverage the behaviour changing and voluntary control efforts of community organizations. Governments should develop sufficient infrastructures to provide substantial training and support resources to community workers. Volunteers who perform community-facing roles need to be provided adequate personal protective equipment. National governments and civil society need to work collaboratively for the realization of not only the short-term COVID-related policy goals but also the long-term health-related sustainable development goals.","Abbas, Muhammad Zaheer",Asia-Pacific journal of public health,18,11

We tested whether this observation translates into renal dysfunction in humans by studying renal functional reserve in adult offspring exposed in utero to maternal type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We compared 19 nondiabetic offspring of type 1 diabetic mothers with 18 offspring of type 1 diabetic fathers (control subjects). Glomerular filtration rate ((51)Cr-EDTA clearance), effective renal plasma flow ((123)I-hippurate clearance), mean arterial pressure, and renal vascular resistances were measured at baseline and during amino acid infusion, which mobilizes renal functional reserve. RESULTS Offspring of type 1 diabetic mothers were similar to control subjects for age (median 27, range 18-41, years), sex, BMI (23.1 ± 3.7 kg/m(2)), and birth weight (3,288 ± 550 vs. 3,440 ± 489 g). During amino acid infusion, glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow increased less in offspring of type 1 diabetic mothers than in control subjects: from 103 ± 14 to 111 ± 17 ml/min (8 ± 13%) vs. from 108 ± 17 to 128 ± 23 ml/min (19 ± 7%, P = 0.009) and from 509 ± 58 to 536 ± 80 ml/min (5 ± 9%) vs. from 536 ± 114 to 620 ± 140 ml/min (16 ± 11%, P = 0.0035). Mean arterial pressure and renal vascular resistances declined less than in control subjects: 2 ± 5 vs. -2 ± 3% (P = 0.019) and 3 ± 9 vs. -14 ± 8% (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Reduced functional reserve may reflect a reduced number of nephrons undergoing individual hyperfiltration. If so, offspring of type 1 diabetic mothers may be predisposed to glomerular and vascular diseases.","Abi Khalil, Charbel; Travert, Florence; Fetita, Sabrina; Rouzet, François; Porcher, Raphael; Riveline, Jean-Pierre; Hadjadj, Samy; Larger, Etienne; Roussel, Ronan; Vexiau, Patrick; Le Guludec, Dominique; Gautier, Jean-François; Marre, Michel",Diabetes,18,7

After going through the experimental process, the virus was named the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by the World Health Organization (WHO) in February 2020 which has created a global pandemic. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection is challenging the people who are especially suffering from chronic health problems such as asthma, diabetes, and heart disease or immune system deteriorating disorders, including cancers, Alzheimer's, etc. Other predisposing/risk factors consist of smoking and age (elderly people are at higher risk). The 2019-nCoV attacks epithelial cells in all organs, particularly epithelial cells in the lungs, resulting in viral pneumonia. The 2019-nCoV starts its invasion with the attachment and entry into the respiratory tract epithelial cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on the epithelial cells. The critical problem with 2019-nCoV is its ability in human to the human asymptomatic transmission which causes the rapid and hidden spread of the virus among the population. Also, there are several reports of highly variable and tightly case-dependent clinical manifestations caused by SARS-CoV2, which made the virus more enigmatic. The clinical symptoms are varied from common manifestations which occurred in flu and cold, such as cough, fever, body-ache, trembling, and runny nose to severe conditions, like the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or even uncommon/unusual symptoms such as anosmia, skin color change, and stroke. In fact, besides serious injuries in the respiratory system, COVID-19 invades and damages various organs, including the kidney, liver, gastrointestinal, and nervous system. Accordingly, to cut the transmission chain of disease and control the infection spread. One of the major solutions seems to be early detection of the carriers, particularly the asymptomatic people with the help of sensitive and accurate diagnostic techniques. Moreover, developing novel and appropriate therapeutic approaches will contribute to the suitable management of the pandemic. Therefore, there is an urgent necessity to make comprehensive investigations and study reviews about COVID-19, offering the latest findings of novel therapies, drugs, epidemiology, and routes of virus transmission and pathogenesis. In this review, we discuss new therapeutic outcomes and cover and the most significant aspects of COVID-19, including the epidemiology, biological features, organs failure, and diagnostic techniques.","Marofi, Faroogh; Azizi, Ramyar; Motavalli, Roza; Vahedi, Ghasem; Nasimi, Maryam; Yousefi, Mehdi; Motavalli, Yalda; Tahmasebi, Safa; Gharibi, Tohid; Mohammed, Rebar N; Etemadi, Jalal; Khiavi, Farhad M",Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,18,1

Samples were collected for mutation analysis from patients who exhibited tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance following treatment or were in the accelerated or blast phase at diagnosis. The mutations in the breakpoint cluster region (BCR)-ABL proto-oncogene 1 (ABL1) kinase domain were evaluated using conventional sequencing or ultra-deep sequencing (UDS) of peripheral blood samples. Sanger sequencing and UDS of the cDNA region corresponding to the BCR-ABL1 kinase domain was performed. χ2 test was used to assess the association of categorical variables between the mutated and non-mutated groups. In addition, the Kaplan-Meier method was applied to generate the survival curves. Sequencing detected 28 different mutations in 54 of the 175 (30.86%) patients with CML. A total of 14 (8.0%) patients presented with the T315I mutation, accounting for the largest proportion in the mutated group. Eight patients (4.6%) presented with more than one mutation, three (37.5%) of whom harboured T315I coexisting with other mutations, and for nine (5.1%) patients, the results differed between conventional sequencing and UDS, with the mutations being missed by conventional sequencing. The results form this study suggested that programing mutation analysis in patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia timely may guide the choice of TKIs.","Liu, Jingjing; Yang, Haiping; Xu, Xiuwen; Yi, Shujuan; Meng, Li",Oncology letters,18,1

Theoretical accounts and field observations suggest that humans use multiple tactics to intervene against offences-including confrontation, gossip and ostracism-which have unique benefits and costs. Here, we draw a distinction between direct punishment tactics (i.e. physical and verbal confrontation) and indirect reputation-based tactics (i.e. gossip and ostracism). Based on this distinction, we sketch the common and unique social functions that different tactics are tailored to serve and describe information-processing mechanisms that potentially underlie decisions concerning how to intervene against offences. We propose that decision rules guiding direct and indirect tactics should weigh information about the benefits of changing others' behaviour versus the costs of potential retaliation. Based on a synthesis of existing evidence, we highlight the role of situational, relational and emotional factors in motivating distinct punishment tactics. We suggest that delineating between direct and indirect tactics can inform debates about the prevalence and functions of punishment and the reputational consequences of third-party intervention against offences. We emphasize the need to study how people use reputation-based tactics for partner recalibration and partner choice, within interdependent relationships and social networks, and in daily life situations.

Until now not much is known about impact these different perfusion systems have on the brain. The objective of this study is to determine carnosinase and brain-type fatty binding protein (BFABP) activity as novel specific biomarkers for ischemic brain tissue damage and how their activity differs during and after MPC and CCPB as well as to compare the inflammatory response of both perfusion systems. In a prospective pilot study, 28 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting were randomly divided into an MPC group (n = 14) and a CCPB group (n = 14). Blood samples were taken before, during, and after operation until the fifth postoperative day. The brain biomarker carnosinase was determined by measuring the rate of histidine production from the substrate homocarnosine, whereas BFABP and interleukin-6 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). C-reactive protein (CRP) and endothelin-1 were determined by enzyme immunoassay. The mean serum carnosinase activity was significantly higher in MPC (0.57 ± 0.34 nM histidine/mL/min) as compared with the CCPB group (0.36 ± 0.13 nM histidine/mL/min) at the end of operation (P = 0.02). The BFABP did not show any difference between the two groups in the immediate postoperative period until the second postoperative day. From that time point onward, it showed a steep increase in the CCPB group (581.3 ± 157.11 pg/mL) as compared with the concentrations in the MPC group (384.6 ± 39 pg/mL) (P = 0.04). The inflammation markers interleukin-6 and CRP showed a similar pattern in both groups without significant difference. In contrast, the leukocyte count on operation day and endothelin-1 on the first postoperative day were significantly higher in the CCPB group (P = 0.01, P = 0.03, respectively). MPC showed a significant higher and stable serum carnosinase activity during extracorporeal circulation as compared with the CCPB due to less hemodilution and a better preserved oxygen capacity. As a consequence, the antioxidant stress during MPC is limited as compared with CCPB, which means less brain tissue damage reflected by a lower BFABP release. Except endothelin-1 and leukocyte count, the inflammatory response of the MPC and CCPB was equal.","Pahari, Dipak R; Gu, Y John; van Oeveren, Willem; El-Essawi, Aschraf; Harringer, Wolfgang; Brouwer, René M H",Artificial organs,18,27

We sought to compare innate immunity of patients undergoing major pulmonary resection for bronchogenic carcinoma via video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and thoracotomy. METHODS Bronchoalveolar lavage was conducted in the contralateral lung before staging bronchoscopy and mediastinoscopy and immediately after lung resection. Blood and exhaled nitric oxide were sampled preoperatively and at 6, 24, and 48 hours postoperatively. RESULTS Forty patients were included (26 VATS and 14 thoracotomy). There was a lower systemic cytokine response from lung resection undertaken by VATS compared with thoracotomy [interleukin 6 (IL-6), analysis of variance (ANOVA) P = 0.026; IL-8, ANOVA P = 0.018; and IL-10, ANOVA P = 0.047]. The VATS patients had higher perioperative serum albumin levels (ANOVA P = 0.001). Lower levels of IL-10 were produced by lipopolysaccharide-stimulated blood monocytes from the VATS patients compared with the thoracotomy patients at 6 hours postoperatively (geometric mean ratio, 1.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-1.33; P = 0.011). No statistically significant differences in the neutrophil phagocytic capacity, overall leukocyte count, or differential leukocyte count were found between the surgical groups (ANOVA P > 0.05). No statistically significant differences in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid parameters were found. Exhaled nitric oxide levels fell postoperatively, which reached statistical significance at 48 hours (geometric mean ratio, 1.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.46; P = 0.029). There were no significant differences found between the surgical groups (ANOVA P = 0.331).

Areas covered: This review provides an overview of the interactions between marketed JAKinibs and major uptake and efflux drug transporters. Consequences regarding pharmacokinetics, drug-drug interactions and toxicity are summarized. Expert opinion: JAKinibs interact in vitro with transporters in various ways, as inhibitors or as substrates of transporters or as regulators of transporter expression. This may theoretically result in drug-drug interactions (DDIs), with JAKinibs acting as perpetrators or as victims, or in toxicity, via impairment of thiamine transport. Clinical significance in terms of DDIs for JAKinib-transporter interactions remains however poorly documented. In this context, the in vivo unbound concentration of JAKinibs is likely a key parameter to consider for evaluating the clinical relevance of JAKinibs-mediated transporter inhibition. Additionally, the interplay with drug metabolism as well as possible interactions with transporters of emerging importance and time-dependent inhibition have to be taken into account. The role drug transporters may play in controlling cellular JAKinib concentrations and efficacy in target cells is also an issue of interest.","Alim, Karima; Bruyère, Arnaud; Lescoat, Alain; Jouan, Elodie; Lecureur, Valérie; Le Vée, Marc; Fardel, Olivier",Expert opinion on drug metabolism & toxicology,18,33

METHOD A search was performed of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Ovid and Cochrane databases on all studies reporting on VR for ORP, ODS and other anatomical abnormalities of the pelvic floor from 2004 until February 2013. No language restrictions were made. All studies on VR were reviewed systematically. The main outcomes were intra-operative complications, conversion, procedure duration, short-term mortality and morbidity, length of stay, recurrence of ORP, recurrence of anatomical disorder, faecal incontinence and constipation, quality of life (QoL) score and patient satisfaction. Quality assessment and data extraction were performed independently by three observers. RESULTS Twenty-three studies including 1460 patients were eligible for analysis. The conversion rate ranged from 0 to 14.3%. No mortality was reported. The immediate postoperative morbidity rate was 8.6%. Length of stay ranged from 1 to 7 days. A significant improvement in constipation and incontinence symptoms was observed in the postoperative period for both ORP and ODS (chi-square test, P < 0.0001).

To monitor New York City (NYC) for the presence of novel variants, we amplified regions of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein gene from RNA acquired from all 14 NYC wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and ascertained the diversity of lineages from these samples using high throughput sequencing. Here we report the detection and increasing frequencies of novel SARS-CoV-2 lineages not recognized in GISAIDs EpiCoV database. These lineages contain mutations rarely observed in clinical samples, including Q493K, Q498Y, H519N and T572N. Many of these mutations were found to expand the tropism of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses by allowing infection of cells expressing the human, mouse, or rat ACE2 receptor. In addition, pseudoviruses containing the Spike amino acid sequence of these lineages were found to be resistant to many different classes of receptor binding domain (RBD) binding neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. We offer several hypotheses for the anomalous presence of these mutations, including the possibility of a non-human animal reservoir. Although wastewater sampling cannot provide direct inference of SARS-CoV-2 clinical sequences, our research revealed several lineages that could be relevant to public health and they would not have been discovered if not for wastewater surveillance.","Smyth, D.

Recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection stimulates type I interferon, myeloid, and inflammatory signatures similar to human disease, and that weight loss can be prevented with vaccines. However, the impact of vaccination on transcriptional programs associated with COVID-19 pathogenesis and protective adaptive immune responses is unknown. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 challenge in hamsters stimulates antiviral, myeloid, and inflammatory programs as well as signatures of complement and thrombosis associated with human COVID-19. Notably, single dose immunization with Ad26.COV2.S, an adenovirus serotype 26 vector (Ad26)-based vaccine expressing a stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, prevents the upregulation of these pathways such that the gene expression profiles of vaccinated hamsters are comparable to uninfected animals. Finally, we show that Ad26.COV2.S vaccination induces T and B cell signatures that correlate with binding and neutralizing antibody responses. These data provide further insights into the mechanisms of Ad26.COV2.S based protection against severe COVID-19 in hamsters. Author Summary In this study, we show that vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S protected SARS-CoV-2 challenged hamsters from developing severe COVID-19 disease by attenuating excessive proinflammatory responses, such as IL-6 and IL-1, macrophages and neutrophils signaling. Ad26 vaccination also prevented the upregulation of pathways associated with thrombosis such coagulation and clotting cascades associated with infection, and the transcriptomic profiles of vaccinated animals were largely comparable to control uninfected hamsters. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 challenged unvaccinated hamsters showed significant increase of these proinflammatory and prothrombotic pathways and significant weight loss compared to vaccinated hamsters.","Aid, Malika; Vidal, Samuel J.; Piedra-Mora, Cesar; Ducat, Sarah; Chan, Chi N.; Bondoc, Stephen; Colarusso, Alessandro; Starke, Carly E.; Nekorchuk, Michael; Busman-Sahay, Kathleen; Estes, Jacob D.; Martinot, Amanda J.; Barouch, Dan H.",bioRxiv,18,1

Several data types can be used to inform transmission network inferences, yet the sensitivity of those inferences to different data types is not routinely evaluated. We evaluated the influence of different combinations of spatial, temporal, and travel-history data on transmission network inferences for Plasmodium falciparum, the pathogen responsible for most human malaria. After developing a new inference framework and applying it to simulated data, we found that these data types have limited utility for inferring transmission networks and, in some combinations, tend to overestimate transmission. Only when outbreaks were highly focal in time or when travel histories were highly accurate was the inference algorithm able to accurately estimate the reproduction number under control, Rc, a key metric of transmission. Applying this approach to surveillance data from Eswatini indicated that inferences of Rc and spatiotemporal patterns therein are sensitive to the choice of data types and assumptions about the accuracy of travel-history data. Taken together, these results suggest that transmission network inferences made with routinely collected surveillance data should be interpreted with caution. As we have done here, future studies inferring transmission networks should apply their algorithm to data simulated under alternative assumptions to assess the robustness of their inferences.","Huber, J.

Its use was rapidly expanded due to the international public health emergency of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) outbreak in 2020. Australian Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) swiftly enabled temporary MBS telehealth items on 13 March 2020, currently extended until 31 March 20211. In the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, Antony et al. conducted a single-centre public survey to assess patient perception of rheumatology telehealth. Their results showed that 98.4% of patients consider telehealth acceptable during the pandemic2. It is unclear, however, whether this positive perception persists after patients experience a telehealth. In addition, a survey data in 2019 suggested more than half of Australian rheumatologists work in private practice3. Therefore, inclusion of private patients will better represent patient perception of telehealth. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate patient satisfaction with telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic. This would determine its feasibility to be integrated in future rheumatology outpatient model. Methods: A questionnaire containing 30 questions was sent to rheumatology patients who attended telehealth appointments at a level 2 public hospital and a local private clinic between April and May 2020. The questionnaires aimed to obtain information on baseline demographics (sex, age, public or private patient, employment status, visual or auditory impairment), appointment details (TPhone or TVideo, usual arrangement for face-to-face (F2F) appointment, cost effectiveness) and appointment satisfaction using a 5-point Likert scale. Descriptive statistical analysis was conducted. Results: The questionnaire was sent to 1452 patients, of which 494 patients responded (34%). Female predominance (77.1%) and a higher proportion of TPhone (79.1%) was seen in the respondents. A majority of patients were existing patients known to the services (90.9%). More than 70% of responses indicated overall satisfaction in specialist care via telehealth, and 88.7% perceived this suitable during a pandemic. Of all respondents, 21.7% were prescribed new medication, and the majority of these patients were confident in taking the new medication after the telehealth appointment. Future acceptability for TPhone was significantly lower in private patients compared to public patients (p= 0.01). Subgroup analysis revealed that higher telehealth satisfaction was associated with needing to take time off work to attend face-to-face appointment (p= 0.02), perception of cost effectiveness (p<0.001) and TVideo (p=0.03). Conclusion: This is the first study which included both public and private rheumatology patients to evaluate patient satisfaction for telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall high level of satisfaction was seen in telehealth most notably associated with its cost effectiveness. A higher percentage of patients who had TVideo compared to TPhone were receptive to future telehealth via TVideo, supportive of the importance of visual cues. This in turn will have significant administrative and technological burdens to coordinate in comparison to a F2F or TPhone review. This qualitative study provides valuable insight of patient perception of telehealth, which has the potential to compliment the traditional rheumatology outpatient model of care following the pandemic.","Oh, Y.; Hennessey, A.; Young, L.; Yates, D.; Barrett, C.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,18,24
167530,167530,167530,Bioinformatics analysis of the 2019 novel coronavirus genome,12.481372,7.3049874,2020,"To cope with the unprecedented surge in demand for data computing for the applications, the promising concept of multi-access edge computing (MEC) has been proposed to enable the network edges to provide closer data processing for mobile devices (MDs). Since enormous workloads need to be migrated, and MDs always remain resource-constrained, data offloading from devices to the MEC server will inevitably require more efficient transmission designs. The integration of nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique with MEC has been shown to provide applications with lower latency and higher energy efficiency. However, existing designs of this type have mainly focused on the transmission technique, which is still insufficient. To further advance offloading performance, in this work, we propose an application-driven NOMA enabled computation offloading scheme by exploring the characteristics of applications, where the common data of the application is offloaded through multi-device cooperation. Under the premise of successfully offloading the common data, we formulate the problem as the maximization of individual offloading throughput, where the time allocation and power control are jointly optimized. By using the successive convex approximation (SCA) method, the formulated problem can be iteratively solved. Simulation results demonstrate the convergence of our method and the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","Ren, Qiqi; Chen, Jian; Abbasi, Omid; Kurt, Gunes Karabulut; Yanikomeroglu, Halim; Yu, F.

A rotation of biologic therapies is recommended in order to better control the disease. Methods: We report the case of a 20-year-old patient followed in our hospital for the management of a deforming and erosive seropositive rheumatoid arthritis (FR +, ACPA +) with a juvenile onset at the age of 8 years. The diagnosis of an immunopositive polyarticular form of JIA was retained in 2010 (9 years old);the patient was treated with methotrexate (MTX) at a dose of 10 mg per week and methylprednisolone at doses varying between 4 and 10 mg per day. Following the failure of MTX, etanercept was introduced for 6 months without success, followed by tocilizumab in 2012 at a dose of 8mg/kg/month for a year, without good response. In 2014, a course of rituximab (RTX) at a dose of 2 shots of 500mg, 2 weeks apart was prescribed followed 9 months later by etanercept at a dose of 50 mg a week for 3 years then by adalimumab (40mg/ week) because of the multiple treatment failures. In 2018, the repetition of RTX at a dose of 1g, renewed 15 days later, improved the patient for only 3 months. Then, a combination of two biologics, namely RTX (2 x 1g, 15 days apart) and adalimumab 1 month later (40mg / week) was received by the patient with a good response at 3 months. The latter was maintained for 7 months even after stopping the adalimumab following confinement for COVID-19. In September 2020, flares occurred and the adalimumab (ADA) has been delivered but without success during 3 months, stopped later for a benign form of COVID-19 (15 months after RTX). In January 2021, the association RTX + ADA was given again and we hope that it will be as effective as the first prescription. Results: The clinical and biological severity of our patient's rheumatoid arthritis led us to give a combination of two biological treatments. Indeed, we do not have other therapeutic classes to deliver to her, that encouraged us to rotate between all the available biological therapies in our country. The combination of a CD20 inhibitor (RTX) with a TNF blocker (ADA) was safe and made possible, for the first time, the achievement of clinical and biological remission during 7 months, even after stopping the TNF blocker. Greenwald et al. reported the safety of the combination of RTX + TNF inhibitors in a randomized clinical trial in 51 patients. Its efficacy, a secondary goal of the study, was suggested at 24 weeks by the percentage of ACR 20 and ACR 50 responses that was greater than in the RTX placebo group. Conclusion: The combination of RTX with a TNF blocker can be a real alternative therapy in rheumatoid arthritis with failure to a biological monotherapy.","Haddouche, A.; Ait Bellabas, K.; Hamrani, W.

Method: We assessed 103 (54 women, 49 men) participants online in three periods of the epidemic curve: time 1 (T1; first cases of community transmission; March 20 to 25, 2020), time 2 (T2; acceleration; April 15 to 20, 2020) and time 3 (T3; continued acceleration; June 25 to 30, 2020). The criteria adopted for calculating prevalence and incidence was identifying participants with scores two standard deviations above the mean compared to normative data. Stress was measured using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), depression was measured using the Filgueiras Depression Index (FDI), and anxiety was measured using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory - State Subscale (STAI-S). Results: Initially, 89% of individuals were free of severe stress, anxiety, and depression, which dropped to 35% by T3. Prevalence of stress increased from 1.9% (95% CI [0.5, 6.8]) at T1 to 7.8% (95% CI [4.0, 14.6]) at T2, and 28.2% (95% CI [20.4, 37.5]) at T3. Depression prevalence increased from 0% (95% CI [0, 3.6]) at T1 to 23.3% (95% CI [16.2, 32.3]) at T2 and 25.2% (95% CI [17.8, 34.4]) at T3. The prevalence of severe anxiety-state symptoms increased from 10.7% (95% CI [6.1, 18.1]) at T1 to 11.7% (95% CI [6.8, 19.3]) at T2 and 45.6% (95% CI [36.3, 55.2]) at T3. Stress incidence increased by 7.8% (95% CI = [4, 14.6]) from time 1 to time 2, 23.3% (95% CI [16.2, 32.3]) from time 2 to time 3, and 26.2% (95% CI [18.7, 35.5]) from time 1 to time 3. Depression incidence increased by 23.3% (95% CI [16.2, 32.3]) from T1 to T2, 15.5 (95% CI [9.8, 23.8]) T2 to T3, and 25.2% (95% CI [17.8, 34.4]) from T1 to T3. Anxiety incidence increased by 9.7% (95% CI [5.4, 17]) from T1 to T2, 39.8% (95%CI [30.9, 49.5]) from T2 to T3, and 35.9% (95% CI [27.3, 45.5]) from T1 to T3. The severity of stress significantly increased from 16.1{+/-}8.7 at T1 to 23.5{+/-}8.4 at T2, and 30.3{+/-}6.0 at T3. Depression severity significantly increased from 48.5{+/-}20.5 at T1 to 64.7{+/-}30.2 at T2, and 75.9{+/-}26.1 at T3. Anxiety increased from 49.0{+/-}13.4 at T1 to 53.5{+/-}12.5 at T2 and 62.3{+/-}13.4 at T3. Females and individuals without comorbidities that increased COVID-19 lethality had higher anxiety scores than males and individuals with comorbidities. Age was inversely associated with mental health outcomes at baseline. Conclusion: The prevalence and severity of stress, depression, and anxiety significantly increased throughout the course of the pandemic. Anxiety seems to be sensitive to gender and risk status, where females and individuals without pre-existing comorbidities had higher anxiety by the final collection point. Depression and stress increased throughout time but were not different between genders or risk status.","Blacutt, M.; Filgueiras, A. J.; Stults-Kolehmainen, M. A.",,18,1

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Google Community Mobility Reports (CMR) provide the necessary data to explore community mobility further. Therefore, we aimed to examine the relationship between community mobility on COVID-19 dynamics in Jakarta, Indonesia. Methods We utilized the mobility data from Google from February 15 to December 31, 2020. We explored several statistical models to estimate the COVID-19 dynamics in Jakarta. Model 1 was a Poisson Regression Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Model 2 was a Negative Binomial Regression Generalized Linear Model (GLM), and Model 3 was a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). Results We found that Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) with some adjustments using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was the best fit model. It explained 52% of COVID-19 cases in Jakarta (R-Square: 0.52, p<0.05). All mobility variables were significant predictors of COVID-19 cases (p<0.05).

We also illustrate the level of government investment in nationally funded research projects related to future mobility for 17 different regions and seven different technology clusters related to future mobility, and determine which research organizations played an important role in each cluster for all 17 regions between 2015 and 2020. Our results indicate that the capital region and Daejeon have high innovation capability in many future mobility-related research fields, whereas some regions have capabilities in specific research fields such as hydrogen infrastructure, indicating their relative competitiveness.","Lee, Doyeon",Sustainability,18,16

Voter competence is unlikely to improve dramatically enough to make much of a difference to our politics. By contrast, the competence of officials can and does vary substantially over short periods of time. To understand variations in government performance, therefore, we would do better to focus on the abilities and performance of officials, not ordinary citizens. We elaborate on this argument, emphasizing the “incompetence multiplier”: the way that the properties of hierarchies can amplify the incompetence of those in powerful positions. We illustrate our argument with an extended discussion of the U.S. response to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bendor, Jonathan Bullock John G.",The Forum,18,20

Unlike proteins, glycans do not typically adopt specific secondary structures and remain very mobile, influencing protein dynamics and interactions with other molecules. Glycan conformational freedom impairs complete structural elucidation of glycoproteins. Computer simulations may be used to model glycan structure and dynamics. However, such simulations typically require thousands of computing hours on specialized supercomputers, thus limiting routine use. Here, we describe a reductionist method that can be implemented on personal computers to graft ensembles of realistic glycan conformers onto static protein structures in a matter of minutes. Using this open-source pipeline, we reconstructed the full glycan cover of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S-protein) and a human GABAA receptor. Focusing on S-protein, we show that GlycoSHIELD recapitulates key features of extended simulations of the glycosylated protein, including epitope masking, and provides new mechanistic insights on N-glycan impact on protein structural dynamics.","Gecht, Michael; von Bülow, Sören; Penet, Camille; Hummer, Gerhard; Hanus, Cyril; Sikora, Mateusz",bioRxiv,18,1

This article aims to provide a framework for supporting sustainable provisions for family and child welfare. We demonstrate how the need for a socially sustainable stance on family and child welfare arises from the recognition of global changes that constantly influence families as well as children’s rights, which ground child- and family-centered actions. The conceptual framework includes three overarching dimensions and four levels of actors that provide a body for 16 conceptual entities in providing socially sustainable family and child welfare. The analysis showed that functional child welfare and family policies, systems, and practices appear essential elements, even necessary preconditions, of sustainability and sustainable development in general. Leaning on the concept of children’s rights, we conclude that the idea of child welfare promises citizens that society has committed to promoting all children’s wellbeing. Implementation of this requires a shared understanding that the conceptual framework provided in this paper urges to actualize.","Hämäläinen, Juha Pihlainen Kaisa Vornanen Riitta",Sustainability,18,17

This is mainly due to uncertainty of failure mode when the beam is subjected to bending and boundary constraints. Many analytical solutions are available for pure-shear tests when beams are subjected to thermo-mechanical loads;however, only few studies are available when plated beams are subjected to bending. This paper presents a simple approach to study the combined effects of temperature dependent parameters and thermo-mechanical loads on debonding mechanism, interfacial stress-distribution, development of bond-length and load of debonding. First-order closed-form solutions are proposed to address two possible cases of simply supported beam: roller-ended or pin-ended. Proposed solutions also introduce temperature effects (as thermal strains) within the interfacial adhesive to fill the gap in literature;this is useful to relate the effect of glass-transition point of adhesive with the composite action. The analytical observations are validated with focussed experiments and literature, and verified with continuum-discrete FE model;leading to parametric investigations and key observations. Effects of temperature are defined in terms of reverse- and inverse-actions.","Khan, M. A.",Composite Structures,18,24

In an attempt to reduce admissions and enable safe early discharge, a COVID virtual ward (CVW) care pathway has been supported by NHS England. This includes discharging people who meet objective criteria based on acuity scores and oxygen saturations, with pulse oximeters and daily phone calls for up to 14 days. Observational studies have reported the safety of this system, but without describing the outcomes from usual care. Methods: A retrospective study using routinely collected health data from all adults with a confirmed positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) swab result between 1st June 2020 and 31st Jan 2021 who attended the Emergency Department or Acute Medical Unit at QEHB, which does not have a CVW service. Criteria for CVW were applied using data from the first 24 hours of presentation to hospital and subsequent health outcomes were included for 28 days, including re-presentation, re-admission, ITU escalation and death. Results were compared to reported studies based in secondary care. Results: During the study period, 26,127 patients presented to QEHB hospital. 2301 had a positive SARS-CoV-2 swab. Of these, 1730 (75.2%) did not meet the criteria for the CVW and 571 (24.8%) did. Of the 571, 325 (56.9%) were discharged home within 24 hours and 246 (43.1%) were admitted for 24 hours or longer. Those admitted were older, with increased co-morbidities, 80.9% required hospital-supported acute therapies after the first 24 hours and 10.6% died. Of the 325 discharged, 44 were readmitted (13.5%), 30 (9.2%) with COVID-related symptoms, 5 (1.5%) required ITU and 1 patient (0.3%) died. These results were comparable to published studies with a CVW service. Discussion: In the current study, discharging patients without a CVW did not confer a greater risk of re-presentation, re-admission, ITU escalation or death. The majority of patients who remained in hospital despite meeting the CVW criteria did so for the provision of treatments or acute assessments. It remains uncertain whether a CVW delivers improvements in hard outcomes, and further research is needed.","Gallier, S.; Atkin, C.; Reddy-Kolanu, V.; Parekh, D.; Zou, X.; Evison, f.; Ball, S.; Sapey, E.",,18,1

In 2020, many workers and students were compelled by the COVID-19 pandemic to work and study from home, where light levels are typically even lower than those found in most schools and workplaces. Using online surveys, this study sought to quantify potential changes in daytime light exposures resulting from teleworking or self-isolating at home and how those changes might have affected self-reported sleep quality, psychological health and emotional health. The first survey was administered in early May 2020, and the second survey was administered in September 2020. In broad terms, our analysis indicates that the greater the amount of light one is exposed to during the day (either in the home or outdoors), the better the self-reported sleep outcomes. Stress and mood were also correlated with greater self-reported daytime light exposures. The results suggest that spending one to two hours outdoors or staying in a bright to very bright room indoors may improve night-time sleep.

Materials and methods: We searched on Medline and Cochrane databases. The search generated 328 manuscripts. We included nine original proteomic studies that investigated human cataractous lenses. Results: Deamidation was the major age-related post-translational modification. There was a significant increase in the amount of A-crystallin D-isoAsp58 present at all ages, while an increase in the extent of Trp oxidation was apparent in cataract lenses when compared to aged normal lenses. During aging, enzymes with oxidized cysteine at critical sites included GAPDH, glutathione synthase, aldehyde dehydrogenase, sorbitol dehydrogenase, and PARK7. Conclusion: D-isoAsp in A crystallin could be associated with the development of age-related cataract in human, by contributing to the denaturation of a crystallin, and decreasing its ability to act as a chaperone. Oxidation of Trp may be associated with nuclear cataract formation in man, while the role of oxidant stress in age-related cataract formation is dominant.","Karakosta, C.; Tzamalis, A.; Aivaliotis, M.; Tsinopoulos, I.",,18,10

Data were analyzed by chi-square, ANOVA, and post hoc Tamhane' T2 testing. Results: 750 responded with the most common cancers represented being prostate (30%), thyroid (24%) ovarian (20%), bladder (8%) and breast (4%). 44% were between 46 and 65 years old and 48% were over 65. Of these, 38% reported being on active treatment. The majority were white (91%), female (56%) and had a bachelor's degree or higher (72%).

Those with breast cancer reported the highest levels of being uncertain (23%) and 30% of those with thyroid cancer reported they would 'probably' or 'definitely' not get vaccinated. Older age, male sex, and college graduates were significantly more likely to get vaccinated. Concerns about side effects were reported by 54%, with younger patients significantly more concerned than those 66 years and older. Of 158 participants who listed other reasons they would not get vaccinated, 23% were concerned that the research and development was rushed and 11% worried about how it might interact with a compromised immune system.

Conclusions: People with cancer are much more interested in COVID-19 vaccination compared to the general public. Despite this, a large percentage of people with cancer reported distrust in either the government and/or the healthcare industry.

COVID-19 has caused over 100 million infections and over 2 million deaths globally. Patients who have received a hematogenic stem cell transplant or cellular therapy (HCT) have a high risk of mortality and morbidity with COVID-19 due to severe immune dysregulation. We conducted a systematic review and metaanalysis aimed to evaluate the outcomes of COVID-19 in HCT patients. Methods: A literature search following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines (PRISMA) guidelines was performed on 3 databases (PubMed, Cochrane, and Clinical trials.gov) from the date of inception to Jan 2021. MeSH terms included 'hematological malignancies', 'hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'SARS-CoV-2', and 'COVID 19'. We screened 99 articles and 6 studies (4 retrospective studies, 2 prospective) were included after excluding review, duplicate, and non-relevant articles. Quality evaluation was done using the NIH quality assessment tool. The Inter-study heterogeneity among the studies was assessed using the Q statistic proposed by Cochrane and the I2 index introduced by Higgins and Thompson. Pooled analysis was done using the 'metaXL', and the random effects model was used to estimate the pooled prevalence with 95% CI. Results: Of 1619 patients in 6studies, 646 HCT patients were analyzed (Table ). The median age of patients was 63 years and 59% were males. Median days since HCT for autologous (auto) HCT and allogeneic (allo) HCT patients were 690 and 450 days respectively. The average follow-up duration after COVID-19 was 24 days. COVID-19 mortality in HCT patients was 20% (95%CI 0.17 to 0.23, I2=0). Roedl et al (n=6) reported a mortality of 83% and was excluded from the pooled analysis. The mortality rate was 19% (95% CI 0.15 to 0.24, I2=0%) in auto HCT patients and 21% (95% CI 0.17 to 0.25, I2=0%) in allo HCT patients. Conclusions: The HCT patients are at significant risk of increased mortality and morbidity due to COVID-19. There is a need to prioritize HCT patients for COVID-19 vaccination, close surveillance, and aggressive management. (Table Presented).","Chaudhary, S. G.; Zafar, M. U.; Hassan, M.

The Government of India has updated guidelines for the clinical management of COVID-19 illness, including severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) definition for triaging suspected COVID-19 cases in an isolated intensive care unit (ICU). The aim of this study was to estimate the adherence of clinicians in triaging COVID-19 suspects as per SARI definition to SARI ICU. This study also observed the impact of such triaging on admission, diagnosis, and treatment process of non-COVID-19 patients admitted to SARI ICU. Patients and methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in a designated SARI ICU of two tertiary care medical college hospitals involving 78 patients from the month of June to July 2020. Data related to demographics, the severity of illness, advanced life supports, delay in diagnosis, intervention, and treatment of patients in SARI ICU due to suspected COVID-19 status were documented. Results: Adherence to SARI definition for triaging COVID-19-suspect cases was 19.2%. Despite hindrance in diagnosis (17.9%) and treatment (12.8%), mortality among patients in SARI ICU was limited to 14.10%. Results were insignificant when checked for various factors associated with mortality. Conclusion: Nonadherence to SARI definition may lead to undue delay in diagnosis, intervention, and treatment of non-COVID-19 cases. This may result in increased morbidity, mortality, and economic burden on patients and the healthcare system.","Arunachala, S.; Venkatesh, B. T.; Bhatt, M.

It becomes inevitable for mathematicians to develop some models that could define the rate of infections and deaths in a population. Although there exist a lot of probability models but they fail to model different structures (non-monotonic) of the hazard rate functions and also do not provide an adequate fit to lifetime data. In this paper, a new probability model (FEW) is suggested which is designed to evaluate the death rates in a Population. Various statistical properties of FEW have been screened out in addition to the parameter estimation by using the maximum likelihood method (MLE). Furthermore, to delineate the significance of the parameters, a simulation study is conducted. Using death data from Pakistan due to Covid-19 outbreak, the proposed model applications is studied and compared to that of other existing probability models such as Ex-W, W, Ex, AIFW, and GAPW. The results show that the proposed model FEW provides a much better fit while modeling these data sets rather than Ex-W, W, Ex, AIFW, and GAPW.

Studies on neuropsychological rehabilitation of visual field defects provide an inconsistent picture regarding the effectiveness of so-called ""restorative approaches"" in visual field recovery (VFR). During a current research project on the clinical evaluation of VFR - in combination with head mounted virtual reality displays (HMD) - a patient (""Patient 7"") suffering from visual neglect was investigated. Although the concept of VFR is originally not intended for patients suffering from higher cortical regions (as in neglect), we hypothesized that due to the strong attention-demanding training situation in HMDs, neglect patients might benefit from these intervention procedures based on restorative approaches. Methods and Analysis. Patient 7 was examined perimetrically using a ""Humphrey Field Analyzer"", ""Goldmann Perimetry"" and our newly developed and validated eye-tracking supported perimetric methodology ""Eye tracking based visual field analysis"" (EFA). Based on these high resolution results from the EFA, the exact location of the transition area between intact and defect visual field of Patient 7 was assessed. Next, bright light stimuli were placed along this area in our newly developed HMD ""Salzburg Visual Field Trainer"" (SVFT). The aim was to stimulate neuroplasticity - according to the concept of restitutive approaches - in the corresponding cortical areas of the patient. Patient 7 trained with the SVFT for a time period of 254 days. In 6 appointments the objective and subjective rehabilitation progress was assessed. Results. Perimetric assessment with the EFA shows an expansion of Patient 7's visual field of 48.8% (left eye) and 36.8% (right eye) after 254 days of training with the SVFT. Individual areas in the patient's visual field show a visual improvement of approximately 5.5 to 10.5 degree of visual angle. Subjective self-report of Patient 7 additionally shows improvements in self-evaluation of up to 317% in visual field functionality compared to self-evaluation on the first assessment date. Conclusions. The results from Patient 7 indicate that patients suffering from visual neglect potentially benefit from a neuropsychological intervention with HMD based on the restorative concept of visual field recovery. However, further studies with large case numbers and a focus both on daily-life improvements and on a clear distinction between patients with lesions in earlier and higher cortical areas are needed to make empirically valid and generalizing statements about our findings.","Leitner, M.

In robotics and related research fields, the study of understanding is often referred to as semantics, which dictates what does the world""mean""to a robot, and is strongly tied to the question of how to represent that meaning. With humans and robots increasingly operating in the same world, the prospects of human-robot interaction also bring semantics and ontology of natural language into the picture. Driven by need, as well as by enablers like increasing availability of training data and computational resources, semantics is a rapidly growing research area in robotics. The field has received significant attention in the research literature to date, but most reviews and surveys have focused on particular aspects of the topic: the technical research issues regarding its use in specific robotic topics like mapping or segmentation, or its relevance to one particular application domain like autonomous driving. A new treatment is therefore required, and is also timely because so much relevant research has occurred since many of the key surveys were published. This survey therefore provides an overarching snapshot of where semantics in robotics stands today. We establish a taxonomy for semantics research in or relevant to robotics, split into four broad categories of activity, in which semantics are extracted, used, or both. Within these broad categories we survey dozens of major topics including fundamentals from the computer vision field and key robotics research areas utilizing semantics, including mapping, navigation and interaction with the world.

The detection of this disease is usually carried out using the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) swab test. However, limited resources became an obstacle to carrying out the massive test. To solve this problem, computerized tomography (CT) scan images are used as one of the solutions to detect the sufferer. This technique has been used by researchers but mostly using classifiers that required high resources, such as convolutional neural network (CNN). In this study, we proposed a way to classify the CT scan images by using the more efficient classifier, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), for images that are processed using a combination of these feature extraction methods, Haralick, histogram, and local binary pattern (LBP). Genetic algorithm is also used for feature selection. The results showed that the proposed method was able to improve KNN performance, with the best accuracy of 93.30% for the combination of Haralick and local binary pattern feature extraction, and the best area under the curve (AUC) for the combination of Haralick, histogram, and local binary pattern with a value of 0.948.

We identified three key reasons for this fall in patient demand. First, COVID-19-related hygiene measures and behavioral changes significantly reduced non-COVID-19 infectious diseases. Second, consultations relating to chronic diseases fell sharply. Third, certain medical investigations and interventions were postponed or cancelled. Despite the drop in hospital attendances and admissions, COVID-19 is said to have brought the Japanese health care system to the brink of collapse. In this context, we explore longstanding systematic issues, finding that Japan's abundant supply of beds and current payment system may have introduced a perverse incentive to overprovide services, creating a mismatch between patient needs and the supply of health care resources. Poor coordination among health care providers and the highly decentralized governance of the health care system have also contributed to the crisis. In order to ensure the long-term sustainability of the Japanese health care system beyond COVID-19, it is essential to promote specialization and differentiation of medical functions among hospitals, to strengthen governance, and to introduce appropriate payment reform.","Ii, M.; Watanabe, S.",,18,1

The length of hospitalization in diabetic patients was higher [median =10(6,16)] than non- diabetic patients [median=7(2,12)] (p=0.036). The mean age of patients in MICU, NMCH was 51 years with 71 % patients aged more than 40 yrs. The patients had a male predominance 31 % patients were Diabetic. 106 patients were diagnosed as T2DM patients after their MICU admission. 29 % patients were Hypertensive and 23 % patients had both T2DM and HTN, 74 % patients had shortness of breath as C/F whereas only 58% patients had fever, RBS level on admission had no significant association [OR(95%CL)=0.882(0.730-1.067)] with mortality Glycemic variability had no significant association [OR(95%CL)=1.000(0.925-1.082)] with duration of hospitalization. A statistically significant association was seen between T2DM and HTN (p=0.01) in COVID-19 patients. A significant (p=0.008) proportion (90.3%) of diabetic patients were aged above 40 years as compared to nondiabetic patients. Conclusion: COVID-19 patients attending NMCH patna have male preponderance. With increasing age, mortality increases in COVID-19 critically ill patients. Diabetes does not increase mortality in COVID-19 patients but increases the length Of hospitalization.","Sinha, Ajay K.; Pandey, Divyanshu Madhukar Major Topno Roshan K.; Kumar, Rishikesh Sinha Sanjay K.",Diabetes,18,8

Amidst the millions of individuals affected directly by the pandemic, pronounced sex differences in the susceptibility and response to SARS-CoV-2 infection remain poorly understood. Emerging evidence has highlighted the potential importance of autoimmune activation in modulating not only the acute response but also recovery trajectories following SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Given that immune-inflammatory activity can be sex-biased in the setting of severe COVID-19 illness, we deliberately examined sex-specific autoimmune reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 in the absence of extreme clinical disease. Methods. We used a bead-based array containing over 90 autoantigens previously linked to a range of classic autoimmune diseases to assess autoantibody (AAB) titers in 177 participants. All participants had confirmed evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection based on presence of positive anti-nucleocapsid IgG serology results (Abbott Diagnostics, Abbott Park, Illinois). We used multivariate analysis to determine whether sex-bias was associated with increased rates of AABs reactivity and symptom burden after SARS-CoV2 infection. Results. 82.4% of AABs reactivity was associated with being male compared to 17.6% with female. We found a diversity of AABs responses that exhibited sex-specific patterns of frequency distribution as well as associations with symptomatology and symptom burden. Conclusion. Our results reveal a remarkable sex-specific prevalence and selectivity of AAB responses to SARS-CoV-2. Further understanding of the nature of triggered and persistent AAB activation among men and women exposed to SARS-CoV-2 will be essential for developing effective interventions against immune-mediated sequelae of COVID-19.","Liu, Y.; Ebinger, J.

Simulations can facilitate policy making as they take prevailing circumstances into account. Moreover, they allow for the investigation of the potential effects of different interventions using an artificial population. Agent-based Social Simulation (ABSS) is argued to be particularly useful as it can capture the behavior of and interactions between individuals. We performed a systematic literature reviewand identified 126 articles that describe ABSS of Covid-19 transmission processes. Our reviewshowed that ABSS is widely used for investigating the spread of Covid-19. Existing models are very heterogeneous with respect to their purpose, the number of simulated individuals, and the modeled geographical region, as well as how they model transmission dynamics, disease states, human behavior, and interventions. To this end, a discrepancy can be identified between the needs of policy makers and what is implemented by the simulation models. This also includes how thoroughly the models consider and represent the real world, e.g. in terms of factors that affect the transmission probability or how humans make decisions. Shortcomingswere also identified in the transparency of the presented models, e.g. in terms of documentation or availability, as well as in their validation, which might limit their suitability for supporting decision-making processes. We discuss how these issues can be mitigated to further establish ABSS as a powerful tool for crisis management.","Lorig, F.; Johansson, E.; Davidsson, P.",Jasss-the Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation,18,16

METHODS We developed 5 scenarios using SPs and an observation form. We included paramedic students and emergency medical service (EMS) providers in our study. They were involved in the simulations. RESULTS A total of 24 paramedic students and 33 EMS providers participated in our study. Sixteen (84%) of 19 teams recognized the possibility of MERS as a measure of their awareness in the baseline evaluation. The participants lacked donning and doffing personal protective equipments, which revealed their baseline level of preparedness for MERS. Certain improvements in donning and doffing personal protective equipment were observed in the posttraining evaluation. The participants provided positive feedback on the training program. CONCLUSIONS The training program was appropriate for both paramedic students and EMS providers. A positive educational climate was created.

After each clip placement, a subsequent clipping device has to be introduced through the working channel. With the Clipmaster3, three consecutive clips can be placed without reloading which could reduce closure time. We performed a prospective study evaluating efficacy, safety, and ease of use. Closure using Clipmaster3 was compared to closure with standard clips. Methods: Patients undergoing closure with the Clipmaster3 were compared to patients who underwent POEM with standard clip closure. Results: In total, 12 consecutive POEM closures with Clipmaster3 were compared to 24 standard POEM procedures. The Clipmaster3 and the standard group did not differ in sex distribution, age (42 years [29 - 49] vs 41 years [34 - 54] P = 0.379), achalasia subtype, disease duration, length of the mucosal incision (25.0 mm [20 - 30] vs 20.0 mm [20 - 30], P = 1.0), and closure time (622 seconds [438 - 909] vs 599 seconds [488 - 664] P = 0.72). Endoscopically successful closure could be performed in all patients. The proportion of all clips used that were either displaced or discarded was larger for Clipmaster3 (8.8 %) compared to standard closure (2.0 %, P = 0.00782). Ease of handling VAS (visual analogue scale) score for Clipmaster3 did not differ between endoscopist and endoscopy nurse (7 out of 10). Conclusions: Clipmaster3 is feasible and safe for closure of mucosal incisions after POEM. Clipmaster3 was not associated with reduced closure time. Compared to standard closure, more Clipmaster3 clips were displaced or discarded to achieve successful closure. A training effect cannot be excluded as a cause of these results.

Hence, it is unclear if the BCoVs circulating in the other countries have distinct genetic characteristics. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and genetic diversity of CD BCoVs based on the deduced amino acid (aa) sequences of the spike (S) and haemagglutinin/esterase (HE) proteins in South Korea. RT-PCR and nested PCR using the primer pairs specific to the nucleocapsid gene, BCoVs detected the BCoVs in 56 (15.6%) of 359 diarrhoeic faecal samples. Phylogenetic analysis of the entire S gene indicated that 10 Korean CD BCoV strains clustered with other Korean BCoV strains with different clinical forms but were different from the American and Canadian BCoV strains. Moreover, the phylogenetic data of the aa sequences of the HE gene revealed all the Korean CD strains to be distinct from the other Korean BCoV strains with different clinical forms. These results suggest that the Korean BCoVs cause endemic infections in diarrhoeic calves in Jeonnam province and have taken a different evolutionary pathway from the BCoVs in other countries. Moreover, the different BCoV strains are circulating in the different clinical forms in South Korea. These results also suggest that vaccines against the BCoVs can be developed with each Korean BCoV in different clinical forms.","Park, S J; Lim, G K; Park, S I; Kim, H H; Koh, H B; Cho, K O",Zoonoses and public health,18,19

MATERIALS AND METHODS Eight patients in the late stage of ARDS (ie, more than 2 weeks after onset) were imaged with thin-section CT. Images were evaluated for ground-glass opacification, consolidation, interstitial thickening, evidence of fibrosis, and any other abnormalities. Patient records were reviewed, and relevant respiratory and ventilatory parameters, total steroid dose, and outcome were recorded. RESULTS All patients received high-dose pulse methylprednisolone (minimum, 2.5 g total), and all patients who received ventilation received low-pressure, low-volume ventilation. Five patients received prolonged mechanical ventilation (for more than 14 days), one received ventilation for 72 hours, and two patients did not receive ventilation. Three patients died, four were discharged from the hospital, and one continued to require ventilation. Ground-glass opacification and interstitial thickening were present at CT in all eight patients. Consolidation was present in six patients. Three patients had evidence of fibrosis. Patients who received long-term ventilation, those who received short-term ventilation, and those who did not receive ventilation had similar pulmonary changes at CT. Pulmonary cysts, most of which were small (<1 cm), were present in five patients. Cysts were present in one patient who received only short-term low-pressure and low-volume ventilation and in one patient who received no mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION The CT features of late-stage ARDS caused by SARS are similar to those seen in late-stage ARDS of other causes, with no apparent differences between patients who do and patients who do not receive prolonged mechanical ventilation. The presence of cysts in one patient who received short-term and one patient who received no mechanical ventilation suggests that severe SARS-induced ARDS may independently result in cyst formation.","Joynt, Gavin M; Antonio, Gregory E; Lam, Philip; Wong, Ka Tak; Li, Thomas; Gomersall, Charles D; Ahuja, Anil T",Radiology,18,1

During the 2003 epidemic, the disease rapidly spread from its origin in southern China to other countries and affected almost 8000 patients, which resulted in about 800 fatalities. A chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease named 3C-like protease (3CLpro) is essential for the life cycle of the SARS-CoV. This main protease is responsible for maturation of functional proteins and represents a key anti-viral target. HPLC and fluorescence-based assays have been used to characterize the protease and to determine the potency of the inhibitors. The fluorogenic method monitoring the increase of fluorescence from the cleavage of a peptide substrate containing an Edans-Dabcyl fluorescence quenching pair at two ends has enabled the use of high throughput screening to speed up the drug discovery process. Several groups of inhibitors have been identified through high throughput screening and rational drug design approaches. Thus, alpha,beta-unsaturated peptidomimetics, anilides, metal-conjugated compounds, boronic acids, quinolinecarboxylate derivatives, thiophenecarboxylates, phthalhydrazide-substituted ketoglutamine analogues, isatin and natural products have been identified as potent inhibitors of the SARS-CoV main protease. The different classes of inhibitors reported in these studies are summarized in this review. Some of these inhibitors could be developed into potential drug candidates, which may provide a solution to combat possible reoccurrence of the SARS and other life-threatening viruses with 3CL proteases.","Liang, Po-Huang",Current topics in medicinal chemistry,18,17

Evidence has accumulated that BEN is an environmentally induced disease. There are three actual theories attempting to explain the environmental cause of this disease: (1) the aristolochic acid hypothesis, which considers that the disease is produced by chronic intoxication with Aristolochia, (2) the mycotoxin hypothesis, which considers that BEN is produced by ochratoxin A, and (3) the Pliocene lignite hypothesis, which proposes that the disease is caused by long-term exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and other toxic organic compounds leaching into the well drinking water from low-rank coals in the vicinity to the endemic settlements. Moreover, it was suggested that BEN risk is influenced by inherited susceptibility. Therefore, it has been expected that molecular biological investigations will discover genetic markers of BEN and associated urothelial cancer, permitting early identification of susceptible individuals who may be at risk of exposure to the environmental agents. Since kidney pathophysiology is complex, gene expression analysis and highly throughput proteomic technology can identify candidate genes, proteins and molecule networks that eventually could play a role in BEN development. Investigation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions could be the content of further studies determining the precise risk for BEN.","Stefanovic, Vladisav; Toncheva, Draga; Atanasova, Srebrena; Polenakovic, Momir",American journal of nephrology,18,22

Because cardiovascular disease varies in Asian countries, we hypothesized that lipid profiles differ in ethnic groups of postmenopausal Asian women. To add to the limited body of information currently available, we also investigated the effects of estrogen/progestin therapy on lipid/lipoprotein profiles in postmenopausal Asian women. METHODS The Pan-Asia Menopause (PAM) study was a prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial evaluating 1028 postmenopausal women at 22 investigational centers in 11 Asian countries/territories. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of three doses of continuous combined conjugated estrogens (CE)/medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA): CE/MPA (in mg/day) = 0.625/2.5, 0.45/1.5 or 0.3/1.5. The treatment period, following baseline evaluations, consisted of six continuous 28-day cycles. Analysis of lipid profiles was a secondary objective of the PAM study. Total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), very low density cholesterol (VLDC-C), triglycerides and lipoprotein(a) were analyzed at a central laboratory by state-of-the-art methods. RESULTS Mean concentrations of total cholesterol, LDL-C, VLDL-C and triglycerides differed significantly among the nine ethnic groups of postmenopausal women. This difference was independent of body mass index and age, two factors that also influenced lipid/lipoprotein profiles. Mean HDL-C concentrations also differed, but this difference was influenced by body mass index in a weak interaction. All three doses of CE/MPA significantly lowered total cholesterol. Treatment with the high and middle doses significantly lowered LDL-C, and increased HDL-C, VLDL-C and triglycerides. The high dose produced a significant decrease in lipoprotein(a). CONCLUSIONS The different lipid/lipoprotein profiles in the nine ethnic groups of postmenopausal Asian women evaluated here suggest a relationship to differences in the prevalence of cardiovascular disease reported for different regions in Asia. However, the reported prevalence data on cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality in the regions corresponding to the nine ethnic groups are insufficient to allow qualitative comparisons with the lipid profiles shown in our study. The lipid/lipoprotein changes in response to estrogen/progestin therapy observed here are consistent with those reported for Western women.","Taechakraichana, N; Holinka, C F; Haines, C J; Subramaniam, R; Tian, X W; Ausmanas, M K",Climacteric : the journal of the International Menopause Society,18,16

Aim Gaining insight in the effects of the impact of the COVID-19-pandemic on psychiatry residents. Method A digital questionnaire was designed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on educational activities. The experience of residents with regards to safety in the workplace, social cohesion with their peers and the involvement of supervisors were examined. Results We approached 34 training institutions. 24 chief residents of the resident group completed the questionnaire. The quality of regional education was considered unchanged by 20% and local education by 33%. Digital communication increased the participation of psychiatrists in the general report and education activities and ensured less travel time. Nevertheless, respondents missed contact with their peers, safety of residents was compromised at five institutions and half of all respondents indicated a lack of personal protective equipment. Conclusions A majority of the psychiatry residents are satisfied with their training during this historic pandemic, but the quality of local and regional education was considered changed, and not being beneficial. The challenge remains for stimulating contact with peers, monitoring the quality of education in general as in psychotherapy and providing personal protective equipment.

It would be of utmost importance to explore if the most routinely used tests could serve as an aid in determining patient's clinical status or predicting severity of the disease. METHODS A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted on 506 Covid-19 positive patients and 200 controls over a period of two months (June and July 2020). The cases were sub-classified based on disease severity into mild to moderate (n=337), severe (n=118) and very severe (n=51) and based on survivor status into survivors (n=473) and non-survivors (n=33). RESULTS There were statistically significant differences in WBC count, Absolute neutrophil count (ANC), Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), absolute monocyte count (AMC), neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), monocyte-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) Red blood cell distribution width (RDW-SD) and RDW CV between covid cases vs controls; among the clinical subgroups and among the survivors and non-survivors. There was a significant strong positive correlation between various parameters, that is, NLR and MLR (r: 0.852, P=0), MPV and PDW (r: 0.912, P=0), MPV and PLCR (r: 0.956, P=0), PDW and PLCR (r: 0.893, P=0). NLR (AUC: 0.676, P=0) was the best single parameter and NLR+RDW-CV was best combination parameter as per area under curve (0.871) of ROC to distinguish severe from mild to moderate disease. CONCLUSIONS Leucocytosis, neutrophilia, lymphopenia and monocytosis were characteristic findings in covid cases while NLR and NLR+RDW-CV emerged as the most effective single and combination CBC parameters in distinguishing mild to moderate and severe cases respectively.","Pujani, Mukta; Raychaudhuri, Sujata; Verma, Nikhil; Kaur, Harnam; Agarwal, Shivani; Singh, Mitasha; Jain, Manjula; Chandoke, R K; Singh, Kanika; Sidam, Dipti; Chauhan, Varsha; Singh, Aparna; Katarya, Khushbu",American journal of blood research,18,11

These glycoproteins interact to form a noncovalent heterodimeric complex which in the cell accumulates in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-like structures. The transmembrane domain of E2, at least, is involved in HCV glycoprotein complex localization in this compartment. In principle, ER localization of a protein can be the consequence of actual retention in this organelle or of retrieval from the Golgi. To determine which of these two mechanisms is responsible for HCV glycoprotein complex accumulation in the ER, the precise localization of these proteins was studied by immunofluorescence, and the processing of their glycans was analyzed. Immunolocalization of HCV glycoproteins after nocodazole treatment suggested an ER retention. In addition, HCV glycoprotein glycans were not modified by Golgi enzymes, indicating that the ER localization of these proteins is not because of their retrieval from the cis Golgi. Retention of HCV glycoprotein complexes in the ER without retrieval suggests that this compartment plays an important role for the acquisition of the envelope of HCV particles. A true retention in the ER was also observed for E2 expressed in the absence of E1 or for a chimeric protein containing the ectodomain of CD4 in fusion with the transmembrane domain of E2. These data indicate that, in HCV glycoprotein complex, the transmembrane domain of E2, at least, is responsible for true retention in the ER, without recycling through the Golgi.","Duvet, S; Cocquerel, L; Pillez, A; Cacan, R; Verbert, A; Moradpour, D; Wychowski, C; Dubuisson, J",The Journal of biological chemistry,18,16

The objective of this study was to identify links between hMPV and influenza virus infections among children with influenza-like illness. METHOD This study was conducted in 2 influenza seasons (2002-2003 and 2003-2004) at 2 pediatric outpatient clinics in Niigata city, Japan. Nasopharyngeal swabs or aspirates were collected from influenza-like illness patients, and hMPV and influenza were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). A nucleotide sequence of 352 nucleotides segment of the F gene was performed. RESULTS A total of 765 influenza viruses and 84 hMPV were identified from 1498 nasopharyngeal swabs or aspirates by virus isolation and RT-PCR, respectively. hMPV-positive rates in patients with influenza-like illness were 5.7 and 5.2% in the 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 seasons, respectively. Epidemic curves of influenza and hMPV patients showed similar patterns with peaks in February in 2 influenza seasons. hMPV infections occurred frequently in infants and school children. Approximately 46% of hMPV patients were coinfected with influenza A viruses, but those coinfected cases were not clinically distinct from the others. No coinfection with influenza B viruses was found. Phylogenetic analysis of the hMPV fusion gene sequences revealed that 2 distinct hMPV cocirculated and that completely identical strains in subgroup A were observed over 2 years. CONCLUSIONS HMPV plays an important pathogenic role in patients with influenza-like illness in winter seasons, often in coinfections with influenza A viruses.","Sasaki, Asami; Suzuki, Hiroshi; Saito, Reiko; Sato, Mizuho; Sato, Isamu; Sano, Yasuko; Uchiyama, Makoto",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,18,1

This paper was to find a soluble and functional recombinant receptor-binding domain of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-Cov), and to analyze its receptor binding ability. METHODS Three fusion tags (glutathione S-transferase, GST; thioredoxin, Trx; maltose-binding protein, MBP), which preferably contributes to increasing solubility and to facilitating the proper folding of heteroprotein, were used to acquire the soluble and functional expression of RBD protein in Escherichia coli (BL21(DE3) and Rosetta-gamiB(DE3) strains). The receptor binding ability of the purified soluble RBD protein was then detected by ELISA and flow cytometry assay. RESULTS RBD of SARS-Cov spike protein was expressed as inclusion body when fused as TrxA tag form in both BL21 (DE3) and Rosetta-gamiB (DE3) under many different cultures and induction conditions. And there was no visible expression band on SDS-PAGE when RBD was expressed as MBP tagged form. Only GST tagged RBD was soluble expressed in BL21(DE3), and the protein was purified by AKTA Prime Chromatography system. The ELISA data showed that GST/RBD antigen had positive reaction with anti-RBD mouse monoclonal antibody 1A5. Further flow cytometry assay demonstrated the high efficiency of RBD's binding ability to ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) positive Vero E6 cell. And ACE2 was proved as a cellular receptor that meditated an initial-affinity interaction with SARS-Cov spike protein. The geometrical mean of GST and GST/RBD binding to Vero E6 cells were 77.08 and 352.73 respectively. CONCLUSION In this paper, we get sufficient soluble N terminal GST tagged RBD protein expressed in E.coli BL21(DE3); data from ELISA and flow cytometry assay demonstrate that the recombinant protein is functional and binding to ACE2 positive Vero E6 cell efficiently. And the recombinant RBD derived from E.coli can be used to developing subunit vaccine to block S protein binding with receptor and to neutralizing SARS-Cov infection.","Chen, Jing; Miao, Lin; Li, Jia-Ming; Li, Yan-Ying; Zhu, Qing-Yu; Zhou, Chang-Lin; Fang, Hong-Qing; Chen, Hui-Peng",World journal of gastroenterology,18,9

In addition, the mechanism of pathogenesis is not well understood. Because clinical disease affects mainly the brain parenchyme, therapeutic agents must be able to traverse the brain-blood barrier (BBB) or have to be introduced directly into the cerebrospinal fluid or brain tissue.

In the absence of a rapid diagnostic test, therapy or vaccine, isolation of individuals diagnosed with SARS and quarantine of individuals feared exposed to SARS virus were used to control the spread of infection. We examine mathematically the impact of isolation and quarantine on the control of SARS during the outbreaks in Toronto, Hong Kong, Singapore and Beijing using a deterministic model that closely mimics the data for cumulative infected cases and SARS-related deaths in the first three regions but not in Beijing until mid-April, when China started to report data more accurately. The results reveal that achieving a reduction in the contact rate between susceptible and diseased individuals by isolating the latter is a critically important strategy that can control SARS outbreaks with or without quarantine. An optimal isolation programme entails timely implementation under stringent hygienic precautions defined by a critical threshold value. Values below this threshold lead to control, but those above are associated with the incidence of new community outbreaks or nosocomial infections, a known cause for the spread of SARS in each region. Allocation of resources to implement optimal isolation is more effective than to implement sub-optimal isolation and quarantine together. A community-wide eradication of SARS is feasible if optimal isolation is combined with a highly effective screening programme at the points of entry.","Gumel, Abba B; Ruan, Shigui; Day, Troy; Watmough, James; Brauer, Fred; van den Driessche, P; Gabrielson, Dave; Bowman, Chris; Alexander, Murray E; Ardal, Sten; Wu, Jianhong; Sahai, Beni M",Proceedings.

METHOD We mapped the distribution of Aotearoa New Zealand's population and the location of potential vaccine delivery facilities under each scenario. Geostatistical techniques identified population clusters for Māori, Pacific peoples and people aged 65 years and over. We calculated travel times between all potential facilities and each Statistical Area 1 in the country. Descriptive statistics indicate the size and proportion of populations that could face significant travel barriers when accessing COVID-19 vaccinations. RESULTS Several areas with significant travel times to potential vaccine delivery sites were also communities identified as having an elevated risk of COVID-19 disease and severity. All potential scenarios for vaccine delivery, with the exception of schools, resulted in travel barriers for a substantial proportion of the population. Overall, these travel time barriers disproportionately burden Māori, older communities and people living in areas of high socioeconomic deprivation. CONCLUSION The equitable delivery of COVID-19 vaccines is key to an elimination strategy.

To reduce the risk of nosocomial cross infections, screening all patients and visitors who visit hospitals and clinics for fever at the entrance of every hospital building has become a standard protocol in Taiwan during the SARS epidemic from mid-April to mid-June 2003. We used a digital infrared thermal imaging (DITI) system (Telesis Spectrum 9000 MB) to conduct mass screening of patients and visitors who entered the hospital to identify those with fever. The DITI system has two components: a sensor head and a PC imaging workstation. The sensor head is an optic-mechanical device which consists of imagining optics for focusing the infrared source information on the infrared detector. The infrared images are further converted into electrical signals, which are then processed for real-time display on the monitor. During the period from April 13 to May 12 2003, 72,327 outpatients and visitors entered Taipei Medical University-Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. A total of 305 febrile patients (0.42%) was detected by infrared thermography. Among them, three probable SARS patients were identified after thorough studies including contact history, laboratory tests and radiology examinations. The findings suggests that infrared thermography was an effective and reliable tool ideal for mass-screening patients with fever in the initial phase of screening for SARS patients at a busy hospital which sees approximately 3,000 outpatients every weekday during the SARS epidemic.","Chiu, W T; Lin, P W; Chiou, H Y; Lee, W S; Lee, C N; Yang, Y Y; Lee, H M; Hsieh, M S; Hu, C J; Ho, Y S; Deng, W P; Hsu, C Y",Asia-Pacific journal of public health,18,1

Apoptosis is considered to be one of the pathogenetic mechanisms in steroid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH). Therefore, we performed this study to investigate whether gastrodin has the potential to prevent steroid-induced ONFH. METHODS All 18 male adult Wistar rats were divided equally into three groups: the steroid group, the gastrodin+steroid group, and the control group. Osteonecrosis was induced by low-dose lipopolysaccharide and subsequent high-dose methylprednisolone. Histomorphometric method was used to determine the incidence of osteonecrosis. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay was performed to detect apoptotic index of osteocytes and osteoblasts. Real-time PCR and Western blotting were performed to detect mRNA and protein expression of Bax, Bcl-2, and Caspase-3. Fisher's exact probability test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Turkey's post hoc test were used to examine significant differences between groups. RESULTS The incidence of osteonecrosis in the gastrodin+steroid group (16.7%) was significantly lower than that in the steroid group (83.3%). According to TUNEL assay, the apoptotic indices in the steroid group, the gastrodin+steroid group, and the control group were 91.1%, 27.1%, and 5.4%, respectively, and the differences were significant between groups. Compared with the control group and the gastrodin+steroid group, the mRNA and protein expression levels of Bax and Caspase-3 were significantly higher in the steroid group, but the Bcl-2 mRNA and protein expression levels were significantly lower.

Pharmaceutical methods represent the main strategy of VTE prevention. The use of aspirin in VTE prevention is still controversial worldwide, especially in China. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of aspirin combined with mechanical measures in the prevention of VTE after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). METHODS Between January 2012 and May 2013 and in accordance with the inclusion criteria, 120 patients undergoing TKA were randomly allocated to two groups. To prevent VTE, patients in group A received aspirin combined with mechanical measures postoperatively, while patients in group B received low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) sodium and rivaroxaban sequentially in combination with mechanical measures postoperatively. All surgeries were performed by one surgeon using a posterior-stabilized cemented prosthesis. The two groups were followed up and compared for the incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) by duplex ultrasound scan and clinical VTE events. The adverse events, the blood loss index, and the cost of VTE prevention were also compared. RESULTS DVT was detected in 10 of 60 patients in group A (16.7%, 95% CI: 7.3%-26.1%) compared with 11 of 60 in group B (18.3%, 95% CI: 8.5%-27.8%) (P = 0.500). There is no statistical evidence supporting the inferior effect of aspirin in preventing DVT as compared with the other medications. There were no cases of symptomatic VTE or death during the follow-up period. Area of ecchymosis was lower in group A than in group B, and the differences were statistically significant. Patients in group A had the lower blood loss index as compared with patients in group B. No transfusion cases were found in both groups. The differences were statistically significant. The cost of VTE prevention analysis indicated a cost reduction using aspirin in group A compared with using LMWH and rivaroxaban in group B. CONCLUSION Aspirin combined with mechanical measures had a good effect on prevention of VTE after TKA and resulted in lower cost, less blood loss, and less subcutaneous ecchymosis.","Jiang, Yi; Du, Hui; Liu, Jian; Zhou, Yixin",Chinese medical journal,18,5

Risk factors were analyzed via questionnaire responses and sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles. Our results indicate that 3% (20/658) of the study participants were seropositive, with one female nurse identified as a subclinical case. Identified SARS-CoV infection risk factors include working in the same building as the hospital's emergency room and infection ward, providing direct care to SARS patients, and carrying a Cw*0801 HLA allele. The odds ratio for contracting a SARS-CoV infection among persons with either a homozygous or a heterozygous Cw*0801 genotype was 4.4 (95% confidence interval, 1.5 to 12.9; P = 0.007).","Chen, Yi-Ming Arthur; Liang, Shu-Yuan; Shih, Yi-Ping; Chen, Chia-Yen; Lee, Yuan-Ming; Chang, Ling; Jung, Shiao-Ying; Ho, Mei-Shang; Liang, Kung-Yee; Chen, Hour-Young; Chan, Yu-Jiun; Chu, Da-Chen",Journal of clinical microbiology,18,1

Videoscope devices are alternatives for airway management in these situations. The ETView VivaSight SL (ETView; ETView Ltd., Misgav, Israel) is a new, single-lumen airway tube with an integrated high-resolution imaging camera. To assess if the ETView VivaSight SL can be a superior alternative to a standard endotracheal tube for intubation in an adult cadaver model, both during and without simulated CPR. METHODS ETView VivaSight SL tube was investigated via an interventional, randomized, crossover, cadaver study. A total of 52 paramedics participated in the intubation of human cadavers in three different scenarios: a normal airway at rest without concomitant chest compression (CC) (scenario A), a normal airway with uninterrupted CC (scenario B) and manual in-line stabilization (scenario C). Time and rate of success for intubation, the glottic view scale, and ease-of-use of ETView vs. sETT intubation were assessed for each emergency scenario. RESULTS The median time to intubation using ETView vs. sETT was compared for each of the aforementioned scenarios. For scenario A, time to first ventilation was achieved fastest for ETView, 19.5 [IQR, 16.5-22] sec, when compared to that of sETT at 21.5 [IQR, 20-25] sec (p = .013). In scenario B, the time for intubation using ETView was 21 [IQR, 18.5-24.5] sec (p < .001) and sETT was 27 [IQR, 24.5-31.5] sec. Time to first ventilation for scenario C was 23.5 [IQR, 19-25.5] sec for the ETView and 42.5 [IQR, 35-49.5] sec for sETT. CONCLUSIONS In normal airways and situations with continuous chest compressions, the success rate for intubation of cadavers and the time to ventilation were improved with the ETView. The time to glottis view, tube insertion, and cuff block were all found to be shorter with the ETView.

In this report, we assess the role of the MHV receptor (MHVR) in controlling this variable virus-induced cytopathology. We developed human (HeLa) cell lines in which the MHVR was produced in a regulated fashion by placing MHVR cDNA under the control of an inducible promoter. Depending on the extent of induction, MHVR levels ranged from less than approximately 1,500 molecules per cell (designated R(lo)) to approximately 300,000 molecules per cell (designated R(hi)). Throughout this range, the otherwise MHV-resistant HeLa cells were rendered susceptible to infection. However, infection in the R(lo) cells occurred without any overt evidence of cytopathology, while the corresponding R(hi) cells died within 14 h after infection. When the HeLa-MHVR cells were infected with vaccinia virus recombinants encoding MHV spike (S) proteins, the R(hi) cells succumbed within 12 h postinfection; R(lo) cells infected in parallel were intact, as judged by trypan blue exclusion. This acute cytopathology was not due solely to syncytium formation between the cells producing S and MHVR, because fusion-blocking antiviral antibodies did not prevent it. These findings raised the possibility of an intracellular interaction between S and MHVR in the acute cell death. Indeed, we identified intracellular complexes of S and MHVR via coimmunoprecipitation of endoglycosidase H-sensitive forms of the two proteins. We suggest that MHV infections can become acutely cytopathic once these intracellular complexes rise above a critical threshold level.","Rao, P V; Gallagher, T M",Journal of virology,18,28

It has been shown that cleavage between E2 and p7 is incomplete, resulting in proteins E2-p7, E2, and p7. We found no precursor-product relationship between E2-p7 and E2, which indicates a stable nature of E2-p7. To study the function of the E2-p7 region of the polyprotein, mutations were introduced into an infectious cDNA of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV). When cleavage between E2 and p7 was abolished, viral RNA replication occurred; however, no infectious virus could be recovered. A corresponding result was obtained with a construct encompassing a large in-frame deletion of p7. To prevent synthesis of E2-p7, a translational stop codon was introduced after the last codon of the E2 gene and an internal ribosome entry site element followed by a signal peptide coding sequence was inserted upstream of the p7 gene. Transfection of RNA transcribed from the bicistronic construct led to the release of infectious virus particles. Thus, synthesis of E2-p7 is not essential for the generation of infectious virions. Cell lines constitutively expressing BVDV p7 and/or E2 were generated for complementation studies. Transfection of BVDV RNAs with point mutations or a deletion in the E2-p7 region into the complementing cell lines led to the generation of infectious virions.

Reviews covering the different facets of the RNAi antiviral immune response in insects have been published elsewhere. In this review, we build a framework to guide future investigation. We focus on the remaining questions and avenues of research that need to be addressed to move the field forward, including issues such as the activity of viral suppressors of RNAi, comparative genomics, the development of detailed maps of the subcellular localization of viral replication complexes with the RNAi machinery, and the regulation of the antiviral RNAi response.","Mongelli, Vanesa; Saleh, Maria-Carla",Annual review of virology,18,1

During CoV infection, numerous cytokines and chemokines are induced in vitro and in vivo. Human interleukin 8 and its mouse functional counterpart, CXCL2, are early-expressed chemokines. Here we show that SARS-CoV and MHV induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and Cxcl2 mRNA transcription during infection in vitro. Expression of the viral spike protein significantly induced ER stress and Cxcl2 mRNA upregulation, while expression of the other structural genes did not. Additional experiments with UV-inactivated virus, cell-cell fusion-blocking antibodies, and an MHV mutant with a defect in spike protein maturation demonstrated that spike-host interactions in the ER are responsible for the induction of ER stress and subsequent Cxcl2 mRNA transcription. Despite significant increases in levels of Cxcl2 mRNA and functional nucleus-to-cytoplasm RNA transport, no CXCL2 protein was released into the medium from MHV-infected cells. Yet Sendai virus-infected cells showed substantial Cxcl2 mRNA induction and a simultaneous increase in levels of secreted CXCL2 protein. Our results demonstrate that expression of CoV spike proteins induces ER stress, which could subsequently trigger innate immune responses. However, at that point in infection, translation of host mRNA is already severely reduced in infected cells, preventing the synthesis of CXCL2 and ER stress proteins despite their increased mRNA concentrations.","Versteeg, Gijs A; van de Nes, Paula S; Bredenbeek, Peter J; Spaan, Willy J M",Journal of virology,18,1

We recall the derivation of the scattering theory for non-equilibrium noise for a general situation where both a bias voltage and a temperature gradient can coexist and put it in a historical perspective. We provide a microscopic derivation of zero frequency noise through a quantum dot based on a tight binding Hamiltonian, which constitutes a generalization of the pioneering work of Caroli et al. for the current obtained in the context of the Keldysh formalism. For a single level quantum dot, the obtained transmission coefficient entering the scattering formula for the non-equilibrium noise corresponds to a Breit-Wigner resonance. We compute the delta-$T$ noise as a function of the dot level position, and of the dot level width, in the Breit-Wigner case, for two relevant situations which were considered recently in two separate experiments. In the regime where the two reservoir temperatures are comparable, our gradient expansion shows that the delta-$T$ noise is dominated by its quadratic contribution, and is minimal close to resonance. In the opposite regime where one reservoir is much colder, the gradient expansion fails and we find the noise to be typically linear in temperature before saturating. In both situations, we conclude with a short discussion of the case where both a voltage bias and a temperature gradient are present, in order to address the potential competition with thermoelectric effects.","Popoff, A.; Rech, J.; Jonckheere, T.; Raymond, L.; Gr'emaud, B.; Malherbe, S.; Martin, T.",,18,1

Devices such as barrier boxes are being considered as potential adjuncts to full PPE's to limit the aerosol spread. Usage of the barrier box raises concerns of delay in time to intubate (TTI). We designed our study to determine if using a barrier box with glidescope delays TTI within acceptable parameters to make relevant clinical conclusions. METHODS: Seventy-eight patients were enrolled in this prospective non-inferiority controlled trial and were randomly allocated to either group C (without the barrier box) or the study group BB (using barrier box). The primary measured endpoint is time to intubate (TTI), which is defined as time taken from loss of twitches confirmed with a peripheral nerve stimulator to confirmation of end-tidal CO 2. 15 s was used as non-inferiority margin for the purpose of the study. We used an unpaired two-sample single-sided t-test to test our non- inferiority hypothesis (H 0: Mean TTI diff &#8805;15 s, H A: Mean TTI diff < 15 s). Secondary endpoints include the number of attempts at intubation, lowest oxygen saturation during induction, and the need for bag-mask ventilation. RESULTS: Mean TTI in group C was 42 s (CI 19.2 to 64.8) vs. 52.1 s (CI 26.1 to 78) in group BB. The difference in mean TTI was 10.1 s (CI -&#8734; to 14.9). We rejected the null hypothesis and concluded with 95% confidence that the difference of the mean TTI between the groups is less than < 15 s (95% CI -&#8734; to 14.9,p = 0.0461). Our induction times were comparable (67.7 vs. 65.9 s).100% of our patients were intubated on the first attempt in both groups. None of our patients needed rescue breaths. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that in patients with normal airway exam, scheduled for elective surgeries, our barrier box did not cause any clinically significant delay in TTI when airway manipulation is performed by well-trained providers. The study was retrospectively registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04411056) on May 27, 2020.","Madabhushi, Praneeth; Kinthala, Sudhakar; Ankam, Abistanand; Chopra, Nitin; Porter, Burdett R",BMC Anesthesiol,18,0

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the risk of mortality comparing critically ill patients with COVID-19 to seasonal influenza. METHODS: We retrospectively identified patients admitted to the intensive care units (ICUs) at two academic medical centers with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 or influenza A or B infections between January 1, 2019 and April 15, 2020. Clinical data were obtained by medical record review. All patients except one had follow-up to hospital discharge or death. We used relative risk regression adjusting for age, sex, number of comorbidities, and maximum sequential organ failure scores (SOFA) on ICU day 1 to determine the risk of hospital mortality and organ dysfunction in patients with COVID-19 compared to influenza. RESULTS: We identified 65 critically ill patients with COVID-19 and 74 with influenza. The mean (± standard deviation) age in each group was 60.4 +/- 15.7 and 56.8 +/- 17.6 years, respectively. Patients with COVID-19 were more likely to be male, have higher body mass index and higher rates of chronic kidney disease and diabetes. Thirty-seven percent of COVID-19 patients identified as Hispanic, compared to 10% of influenza patients. A similar proportion of patients had fever (~40%) and lymphopenia (~80%) on hospital presentation. Rates of acute kidney injury and shock requiring vasopressors were similar between the groups. While need for invasive mechanical ventilation was also similar in both groups, patients with COVID-19 had slower improvements in oxygenation, longer durations of mechanical ventilation, and lower rates of extubation compared to patients with influenza. Hospital mortality was 40% in COVID-19 patients and 19% in influenza patients (adjusted relative risk 2.13, 95% confidence interval 1.24 to 3.63; p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Need for invasive mechanical ventilation was common in ICU patients with COVID-19 or influenza. Compared to those with influenza, ICU patients with COVID-19 had worse respiratory outcomes, including longer duration of mechanical ventilation. Additionally, patients with COVID-19 were at greater risk for in-hospital mortality, independent of age, sex, co-morbidities, and ICU severity of illness.","Cobb, Natalie L; Sathe, Neha A; Duan, Kevin I; Seitz, Kevin P; Thau, Matthew R; Sung, Clifford C; Morrell, Eric D; Mikacenic, Carmen; Kim, H Nina; Liles, W Conrad; Luks, Andrew M; Town, James; Pipavath, Sudhakar; Wurfel, Mark M; Hough, Catherine L; West, T Eoin; Bhatraju, Pavan K",Ann Am Thorac Soc,18,1

However, recombinant adenoviral technology is laborious, time-consuming, and expensive. Here, we present an improved protocol using the pAdEasy system to obtain purified adenoviral particles that can induce a strong green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression in transduced cells. The advantages of this improved method are faster preparation and decreased production cost compared to the original method developed by Bert Vogelstein. The main steps of the adenoviral technology are: (1) the recombination of pAdTrack-GFP with the pAdEasy-1 plasmid in BJ5183 bacteria; (2) the packaging of the adenoviral particles; (3) the amplification of the adenovirus in AD293 cells; (4) the purification of the adenoviral particles from cell lysate and culture medium; and (5) the viral titration and functional testing of the adenovirus. The improvements to the original method consist of (i) the recombination in BJ5183-containing pAdEasy-1 by chemical transformation of bacteria; (ii) the selection of recombinant clones by ""negative"" and ""positive"" PCR; (iii) the transfection of AD293 cells using the K2 transfection system for adenoviral packaging; (iv) the precipitation with ammonium sulfate of the viral particles released by AD293 cells in cell culture medium; and (v) the purification of the virus by one-step cesium chloride discontinuous gradient ultracentrifugation. A strong expression of the gene of interest (in this case, GFP) was obtained in different types of transduced cells (such as hepatocytes, endothelial cells) from various sources (human, bovine, murine).

The role of social media amid the current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has often been criticized, but little systematic research has been conducted on this issue. Social media functions as a convenient source of information in pandemic situations. OBJECTIVE: Few infodemiology studies have applied network analysis in conjunction with content analysis. This study investigates information transmission networks and news-sharing behaviors regarding COVID-19 on Twitter in Korea. The real time aggregation of social media data can serve as a starting point for designing strategic messages for health campaigns and establishing an effective communication system during this outbreak. METHODS: Korean COVID-19-related Twitter data were collected on February 29, 2020. Our final sample comprised of 43,832 users and 78,233 relationships on Twitter. We generated four networks in terms of key issues regarding COVID-19 in Korea. This study comparatively investigates how COVID-19-related issues have circulated on Twitter through network analysis. Next, we classified top news channels shared via tweets. Lastly, we conducted a content analysis of news frames used in the top-shared sources. RESULTS: The network analysis suggests that the spread of information was faster in the Coronavirus network than in the other networks (Corona19, Shincheon, and Daegu). People who used the word ""Coronavirus"" communicated more frequently with each other. The spread of information was faster, and the diameter value was lower than for those who used other terms. Many of the news items highlighted the positive roles being played by individuals and groups, directing readers' attention to the crisis. Ethical issues such as deviant behavior among the population and an entertainment frame highlighting celebrity donations also emerged often. There was a significant difference in the use of nonportal (n=14) and portal news (n=26) sites between the four network types. The news frames used in the top sources were similar across the networks (P=.89, 95% CI 0.004-0.006). Tweets containing medically framed news articles (mean 7.571, SD 1.988) were found to be more popular than tweets that included news articles adopting nonmedical frames (mean 5.060, SD 2.904; N=40, P=.03, 95% CI 0.169-4.852). CONCLUSIONS: Most of the popular news on Twitter had nonmedical frames. Nevertheless, the spillover effect of the news articles that delivered medical information about COVID-19 was greater than that of news with nonmedical frames. Social media network analytics cannot replace the work of public health officials; however, monitoring public conversations and media news that propagates rapidly can assist public health professionals in their complex and fast-paced decision-making processes.","Park, Han Woo; Park, Sejung; Chong, Miyoung",J Med Internet Res,18,15

It examines and contrasts the European Union's conditionality policies, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank as the more influential and leading groups of institutions. The article reveals notable policy differences. As opposed to that of the IMF and WB, the EU's approach is more comprehensive and not confined to economic considerations. Those variations aside, the article draws on the same premise: expectations of compliance with the set conditions. While in-depth, structural requirements could guide ordinary decision-making and build up resilient national institutions and policies, this article questions the merits of large-scale comprehensive terms in the face of a situation created by a force majeure or a humanly uncontrollable event such as the COVID-19 pandemic. With no more initial research addressing the specific question of the application and adequacy of conditionality to force majeure emergencies or pandemic situations of the scale of COVID-19, this article argues in favor of a measured and targeted response limited to the development, design, or determination of policy choices that tackle the intended purpose. Also, for validly practical considerations that search for to ensure the better use of aid and avoid distracting or overburdening the recipient countries to the point of risking losses of devastating proportions, the article proposes to revise and limit conditionality during force majeure events to the essential aspects of transparent management of funds for the sole intended purpose.

These may get amplified with effects of pneumo-peritoneum and carbon dioxide (CO2) insufflation during laparoscopic surgeries. Our aim was to compare metabolic and blood gas analysis of smokers versus non-smoker patients during laparoscopic surgeries under general anaesthesia. Methods: After permission from institutional review board, 60 patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were divided into two groups, smokers and non-smokers (30 each). Along with baseline haemo-dynamic parameters, arterial blood gas sampling was done to assess and compare PCO2, pH and bicarbonate (HCO3) values at various time intervals with respect to pneumo-peritoneum creation, between smokers and non smokers. Results: Baseline systolic blood pressure was higher and oxygen saturation was significantly lower in smoker group. PCO2 and end-tidal CO2 were significantly higher in smokers at all intervals (P < 0.001). pH was significantly lower and HCO3 higher, in smokers after creation of pneumo-peritoneum. Increase in PCO2 due to pneumo-peritoneum was higher in the smoker group (3.49 ± 8.5) mmHg versus non smoker (0.56 ± 4.86) mmHg, although statistically not significant. Change in pH and HCO3 was similar between smokers and non-smokers. Conclusion: There is a significant difference in baseline arterial blood gas characteristics between smokers and non-smokers. Metabolic effects of CO2 insufflation and increased intraabdominal pressure appears to be more enhanced in smokers.","Barik, Amiya K; Kumar, Ajit; Dhar, Mridul; Ranjan, Pushkar",Indian J Anaesth,18,26

However, such sensitive daily communications containing personal information are difficult to collect on a server for centralized learning in real life due to escalating privacy concerns. To this end, we propose a decentralized phishing email detection method called the Federated Phish Bowl (FPB) leveraging federated learning and long short-term memory (LSTM). FPB allows common knowledge representation and sharing among different clients through the aggregation of trained models to safeguard the email security and privacy. A recent phishing email dataset was collected from an intergovernmental organization to train the model. Moreover, we evaluated the model performance based on various assumptions regarding the total client number and the level of data heterogeneity. The comprehensive experimental results suggest that FPB is robust to a continually increasing client number and various data heterogeneity levels, retaining a detection accuracy of 0.83 and protecting the privacy of sensitive email communications.","Sun, Yuwei; Chong, Ng; Ochiai, Hideya",,18,10

Additionally, we also explored factors that may affect the difference in terms of vWF antigen between the two groups. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was performed using the PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases from inception up until 7 April 2021. The main outcome was poor outcome, which is a composite of mortality and severe COVID-19. RESULTS: There are 10 studies comprising of 996 patients included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. vWF antigen was higher in patients with poor outcome (standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.84 [0.45, 1.23], p<0.001; I2: 87.3, p<0.001). Subgroup analysis on vWF antigen that uses percentage as unit (mean difference 121.6 [53.7, 189.4], p<0.001; I2: 92.0, p<0.001). Meta-regression showed that the SMD between poor outcome and good outcome was affected by platelets (coefficient: 0.0061, p=0.001), d-dimer (coefficient: 0.0007, p=0.026), and factor VIII level (coefficient: 0.0057, p=0.031), but not by age (coefficient: -0.0610, p=0.440), gender (coefficient: 0.0135, p=0.698), obesity (coefficient: 0.0282, p=0.666), hypertension (coefficient: 0.0273, p=0.423), diabetes (coefficient: 0.0317, p=0.398), malignancy (coefficient: 0.0487, p=0.608). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis showed that the level of vWF antigen was significantly higher in patients with poor outcome, signaling a marked endotheliopathy. Meta-regression showed that differences became larger as the number of platelets, d-dimer levels, and factor VIII levels increases.","Wibowo, Arief; Pranata, Raymond; Lim, Michael Anthonius; Akbar, Mohammad Rizki; Martha, Januar Wibawa",Int. j. infect. dis,18,22

We describe an epidemiological investigation that, with use of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) serological assays, established links between three clusters of COVID-19. METHODS: In Singapore, active case-finding and contact tracing were undertaken for all COVID-19 cases. Diagnosis for acute disease was confirmed with RT-PCR testing. When epidemiological information suggested that people might have been nodes of disease transmission but had recovered from illness, SARS-CoV-2 IgG serology testing was used to establish past infection. FINDINGS: Three clusters of COVID-19, comprising 28 locally transmitted cases, were identified in Singapore; these clusters were from two churches (Church A and Church B) and a family gathering. The clusters in Church A and Church B were linked by an individual from Church A (A2), who transmitted SARS-CoV-2 infection to the primary case from Church B (F1) at a family gathering they both attended on Jan 25, 2020. All cases were confirmed by RT-PCR testing because they had active disease, except for A2, who at the time of testing had recovered from their illness and tested negative. This individual was eventually diagnosed with past infection by serological testing. ELISA assays showed an optical density of more than 1·4 for SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein and receptor binding domain antigens in titres up to 1/400, and viral neutralisation was noted in titres up to 1/320. INTERPRETATION: Development and application of a serological assay has helped to establish connections between COVID-19 clusters in Singapore. Serological testing can have a crucial role in identifying convalescent cases or people with milder disease who might have been missed by other surveillance methods.

MethodsA total of 28 patients with COVID-2019 and liver injury who were admitted to the designated hospitals for COVID-2019 in Bozhou, China from February 1 to 12, 2020 were enrolled, and they were divided into male group（n=15） and female group（n=13） according to sex or young group（n=10） and middle-aged and elderly group（n=17） according to age. The levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were measured on admission. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for comparison of continuous data between two groups, the Fisher exact test was used for comparison of categorical data between two groups. ResultsVarying degrees of liver injury were observed in the 28 patients. There were no significant differences in the levels of ALT, AST, GGT, ALP, and LDH between the male group and the female group and between the young group and the middle-aged and elderly group (all P＞0.05). There was no significant difference in abnormal rate of ALT, AST, GGT and LDH between male group and female group (all P＞0.05); There was no significant difference in abnormal rate of ALT, AST, GGT between the young group and the middle-aged and elderly group (all P＞0.05); there was a significant difference in abnormal rate of LDH between the young group and the middle-aged and elderly group(P＜0.05). ConclusionPatients with COVID-2019 may experience different degrees of liver injury with the development of the disease, middle-aged and elderly patients tend to develop liver injury.There was no significant correlation with gender and age in mild and general patients. Therefore, liver function should be monitored in patients with COVID-2019, and the treatment method should be selected carefully to prevent liver injury.","Guangming, LI; PAN, Xin",Journal of Clinical Hepatology,18,8

The pandemic has taken a geopolitical dimension. The health crisis amplified the competitive dynamics between the USA and China, affected the provision of global public goods and injected instability into the global order. In line with the geopolitical zero-sum thinking, both the USA and China have sought to capitalize on the crisis to boost their international profile. Instead of working together to mitigate the health and economic impacts of COVID-19, the two powers fear that the other will exploit the current situation to accrue political, economic or military gains that will give it an edge after the pandemic subsides. The spread of COVID-19 has set off a “battle of narratives,” in which China and the USA are accusing each other of failing to rise to the challenge. The world seems to be falling into a “Kindleberger Trap,” in which the established power is unable to lead while the rising power is unwilling to assume responsibility. The COVID-19 crisis is occurring amid the collapse of global cooperation. The USA, the traditional leader of international collective efforts in times of crisis, has abandoned its role entirely. The lack of leadership at the global level during an international crisis may cause the breakdown of the international order.Design/methodology/approachThis paper examines the US-China competitive dynamics through the lens of the work of Charles Kindleberger, which both liberals and realists regard as foundational when examining the dynamics of global crisis management. This paper also uses the meta-geopolitics framework to determine the ability of both China and the USA to respond to the current COVID-19 crisis and its implications for their power and standing in the international system.FindingsThis paper concludes that the only way to escape the Kindleberger trap is “to embed Sino-American relations in multilateralism.”Originality/valueAs rivals, both the USA and China are seeking to capitalize on the crisis to boost their international profile. This paper probes how China and the USA navigated the ongoing COVID-19 crisis to determine whether or not they are currently in a “Kindleberger Trap,” using elements of the meta-geopolitics framework of analysis, namely, health issues, domestic politics, economics, science and international diplomacy. Using the meta-geopolitics framework will help us determine the ability of both China and the USA to respond to the current COVID-19 crisis and the implications of that on their power and standing in the international system.","Bahi, Riham",Review of Economics and Political Science,18,8

However, the population of patients with COVID who are admitted with false negative testing is unstudied. OBJECTIVE: To characterize and develop a model to predict true SARS-CoV-2 infection among patients who initially test negative for COVID by PCR. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Five hospitals within the Yale New Haven Health System between 3/10/2020 and 9/1/2020. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients who received diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 virus within the first 96 hours of hospitalization. EXPOSURE: We developed a logistic regression model from readily available electronic health record data to predict SARS-CoV-2 positivity in patients who were positive for COVID and those who were negative and never retested. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: This model was applied to patients testing negative for SARS-CoV-2 who were retested within the first 96 hours of hospitalization. We evaluated the ability of the model to discriminate between patients who would subsequently retest negative and those who would subsequently retest positive. RESULTS: We included 31,459 hospitalized adult patients; 2,666 of these patients tested positive for COVID and 3,511 initially tested negative for COVID and were retested. Of the patients who were retested, 61 (1.7%) had a subsequent positive COVID test. The model showed that higher age, vital sign abnormalities, and lower white blood cell count served as strong predictors for COVID positivity in these patients. The model had moderate performance to predict which patients would retest positive with a test set area under the receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) of 0.76 (95% CI 0.70-0.83). Using a cutpoint for our risk prediction model at the 90th percentile for probability, we were able to capture 35/61 (57%) of the patients who would retest positive. This cutpoint amounts to a number-needed-to-retest range between 15 and 77 patients. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: We show that a pragmatic model can predict which patients should be retested for COVID. Further research is required to determine if this risk model can be applied prospectively in hospitalized patients to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Ghazi, Lama; Simonov, Michael; Mansour, Sherry G; Moledina, Dennis G; Greenberg, Jason H; Yamamoto, Yu; Biswas, Aditya; Wilson, F Perry",PLoS One,18,15

Physical distancing policies can control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 by reducing the amount of these interactions in a population. Here, we report results from four waves of contact surveys designed to quantify the impact of these policies during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. We surveyed 9,743 respondents between March 22 and September 26, 2020. We find that interpersonal contact has been dramatically reduced in the US, with an 82% (95%CI: 80%-83%) reduction in the average number of daily contacts observed during the first wave compared to pre-pandemic levels. However, we find increases in contact rates over the subsequent waves. We also find that certain demographic groups, including people under 45 and males, have significantly higher contact rates than the rest of the population. Tracking these changes can provide rapid assessments of the impact of physical distancing policies and help to identify at-risk populations.","Feehan, Dennis M; Mahmud, Ayesha S",Nat Commun,18,1

Mobile mental health apps can be scalable and useful tools in large-scale disaster responses and are particularly promising for reaching vulnerable populations. COVID Coach is a free, evidence-informed mobile app designed specifically to provide tools and resources for addressing COVID-19-related stress. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to characterize the overall usage of COVID Coach, explore retention and return usage, and assess whether the app was reaching individuals who may benefit from mental health resources. METHODS: Anonymous usage data collected from COVID Coach between May 1, 2020, through October 31, 2020, were extracted and analyzed for this study. The sample included 49,287 unique user codes and 3,368,931 in-app events. RESULTS: Usage of interactive tools for coping and stress management comprised the majority of key app events (n=325,691, 70.4%), and the majority of app users tried a tool for managing stress (n=28,009, 58.8%). COVID Coach was utilized for &#8804;3 days by 80.9% (n=34,611) of the sample whose first day of app use occurred within the 6-month observation window. Usage of the key content in COVID Coach predicted returning to the app for a second day. Among those who tried at least one coping tool on their first day of app use, 57.2% (n=11,444) returned for a second visit; whereas only 46.3% (n=10,546) of those who did not try a tool returned (P<.001). Symptoms of anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were prevalent among app users. For example, among app users who completed an anxiety assessment on their first day of app use (n=4870, 11.4% of users), 55.1% (n=2680) reported levels of anxiety that were moderate to severe, and 29.9% (n=1455) of scores fell into the severe symptom range. On average, those with moderate levels of depression on their first day of app use returned to the app for a greater number of days (mean 3.72 days) than those with minimal symptoms (mean 3.08 days; t1=3.01, P=.003). Individuals with significant PTSD symptoms on their first day of app use utilized the app for a significantly greater number of days (mean 3.79 days) than those with fewer symptoms (mean 3.13 days; t1=2.29, P=.02). CONCLUSIONS: As the mental health impacts of the pandemic continue to be widespread and increasing, digital health resources, such as apps like COVID Coach, are a scalable way to provide evidence-informed tools and resources. Future research is needed to better understand for whom and under what conditions the app is most helpful and how to increase and sustain engagement.","Jaworski, Beth K; Taylor, Katherine; Ramsey, Kelly M; Heinz, Adrienne; Steinmetz, Sarah; Pagano, Ian; Moraja, Giovanni; Owen, Jason E",J Med Internet Res,18,32

Re-usable elastomeric respirators may provide a suitable alternative. Proprietary elastomeric respirator filters may become depleted as demand increases. An alternative may be the virus/bacterial filters used in anaesthesia circuits, if they can be adequately fitted onto the elastomeric respirators. In addition, many re-usable elastomeric respirators do not filter exhaled breaths. If used for sterile procedures, this would also require modification. We designed a 3D-printed adaptor that permits elastomeric respirators to interface with anaesthesia circuit filters and created a simple modification to divert exhaled breaths through the filter. We conducted a feasibility study evaluating the performance of our modified elastomeric respirators. A convenience sample of eight volunteers was recruited. Quantitative fit testing, respiratory rate and end-tidal carbon dioxide were recorded during fit testing exercises and after 1 h of wear. All eight volunteers obtained excellent quantitative fit testing throughout the trial. The mean (SD) end-tidal carbon dioxide was 4.5 (0.5) kPa and 4.6 (0.4) kPa at baseline and after 1 h of wear (p = 0.148).

The ACE2 enzyme intrinsically involved in the physiology of cardiac function and in the development of hypertension and diabetes has been identified as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2. It is difficult to highlight the precise mechanisms of cardiac damage because of its possible multiple implications, through direct damage from SARS-CoV-2 responsible for viral myocarditis or indirect damage from the state of exacerbated systemic inflammation associated with hypoxaemia. The treatments of the disease may also induce adverse effects such as an increase in QT segment duration. Measurements of cardiac biomarkers are required if myocardial damage is suspected and are part of a panel of arguments confronted with clinical features, ultrasonic monitoring and electrocardiogram.

This study aimed to identify the mechanism of circRNA_0043691 in regulating the progression of GC. GSE141977 was downloaded from Gene Expression Omibus ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ ). Differentially expressed circRNAs were obtained by R software. The expression levels of circRNA_0043691 in GC tissue and normal tissue were identified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Knockdown of circRNA_0043691 was then constructed and verified by qRT-PCR. Cell viability, migration, and invasion capacity were determined by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, Transwell migration, and invasion, respectively. Next, knockdown of miR-873-3p was constructed and co-cultured with circRNA_0043691 knockdown to identify whether knockdown of miR-873-3p could attenuate the circRNA_0043691 knockdown on GC cells proliferation, migration, and invasion. The relationship between miR-873-3p and circRNA_0043691 or GART was predicted by bioinformatics tools and verified by dual-luciferase reporter. A total of 211 circRNAs were significantly differentially expressed, including 143 remarkably downregulated circRNAs and 68 significantly upregulated circRNAs. CircRNA_0043691 was upregulated in GC tissue. Knockdown of circRNA_0043691 decreased cell viability, migration, and invasion in GC cells. CircRNA_0043691 has potential putative binding sites with miR-873-3p. Moreover, CircRNA_0043691 positively regulated GART expression by sponging miR-873-3p. Furthermore, knockdown of miR-591 could partially attenuate the si-circRNA_0043691 on the GART expression. GART was upregulated in GC tissue and knockdown of GART could inhibit GC cells proliferation and invasion. Knockdown of circRNA_0043691 delayed the progression of GC via modulating the miR-873-3p-GART axis.","Zhang, Yu; Hu, Gengyuan; Zhang, Zhenxing; Jing, Yuanming; Tao, Feng; Ye, Minfeng",Mamm. genome,18,13

Since its first appearance in China in December 2019, the pandemic has spread rapidly throughout the world. Despite considerable efforts made to contain the disease, the virus has continued its prevalence in many countries with varying degrees of clinical manifestations. To contain this pandemic, collaborative approach involving accurate diagnosis, epidemiology, surveillance, and prophylaxis is essential. However, proper diagnosis using rapid technologies plays a crucial role. With increasing incidence of COVID-19 cases, the accurate and early detection of the SARS-CoV-2 is need of the hour for effective prevention and management of COVID-19 cases as well as to curb its spread. RT-qPCR assay is considered to be the gold standard for the early detection of virus, but this protocol has limited application to use as bedside test because of its technical complexity. To address these challenges, several POC assays have been developed to facilitate the COVID-19 diagnosis outside the centralized testing laboratories as well to accelerate the clinical decision making with a least turnaround time. Hence, in this report, we review different nucleic acid-based and serological techniques available for the diagnosis and effective prevention of COVID-19.

The sorption and the immobilization experiments indicated a higher sorption capacity and immobilization efficiency of Pb compared to those of Cd. The characteristics of XRD, FTIR, SEM, and XPS manifested that dissolution-precipitation, cation exchange, complexation, and cation-&#960; interaction were the main four mechanisms for the sorption of Pb2+ and Cd2+ using composite material PC1 (nHAP/BC = 1/1). From semi-quantitative analysis, the mineral effect accounted for the majority of the immobilization of Pb and Cd. Due to obvious Pb-precipitates in the sorbed material, dissolution-precipitation primarily affected the sorption of Pb using PC1, while the immobilization of Cd was mainly attributable to cation exchange. Such results corresponded to the stable Pb-precipitates and unstable Cd-compounds in soil, among which the latter was prone to be released into the environment. The sorption capacity in aqueous solutions and the immobilization efficiencies in the soil for both Pb and Cd increased with the addition of nHAP, which were linearly correlated to the nHAP proportion in the composite materials. In future practical applications, the percentages of composite materials can be designed according to the specific pollutant concentration. This study sheds light on the explicit immobilization mechanisms for Pb and Cd in aqueous solutions to better understand their behaviors in the soil remediated by relevant materials.","Zhou, Cailing; Song, Xin; Wang, Yiwei; Wang, Hui; Ge, Shifu",Chemosphere,18,1

It caused an extensive health and economic burden around the globe. There is no proven effective treatment yet, except certain preventive mechanisms. Some studies assessing the effects of different preventive strategies have been published. However, there is no conclusive evidence. Therefore, this study aimed to review evidences related to COVID-19 prevention strategies achieved through contact tracing, screening, quarantine, and isolation to determine best practices. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review in accordance with the PRISMA and Cochrane guidelines by searching articles from major medical databases such as PubMed/Medline, Global Health Database, Embase, CINAHL, Google Scholar, and clinical trial registries. Non-randomized and modeling articles published to date in areas of COVID prevention with contact tracing, screening, quarantine, and isolation were included. Two experts screened the articles and assessed risk of bias with ROBINS-I tool and certainty of evidence with GRADE approach. The findings were presented narratively and in tabular form. RESULTS: We included 22 (9 observational and 13 modeling) studies. The studies consistently reported the benefit of quarantine, contact tracing, screening, and isolation in different settings. Model estimates indicated that quarantine of exposed people averted 44 to 81% of incident cases and 31 to 63% of deaths. Quarantine along with others can also halve the reproductive number and reduce the incidence, thus, shortening the epidemic period effectively. Early initiation of quarantine, operating large-scale screenings, strong contact tracing systems, and isolation of cases can effectively reduce the epidemic. However, adhering only to screening and isolation with lower coverage can miss more than 75% of asymptomatic cases; hence, it is not effective. CONCLUSION: Quarantine, contact tracing, screening, and isolation are effective measures of COVID-19 prevention, particularly when integrated together. In order to be more effective, quarantine should be implemented early and should cover a larger community.","Girum, Tadele; Lentiro, Kifle; Geremew, Mulugeta; Migora, Biru; Shewamare, Sisay",Trop Med Health,18,1

It is critical to understand how the predictive value of the test varies with time from exposure and symptom onset to avoid being falsely reassured by negative test results. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the false-negative rate by day since infection. DESIGN: Literature review and pooled analysis. SETTING: 7 previously published studies providing data on RT-PCR performance by time since symptom onset or SARS-CoV-2 exposure using samples from the upper respiratory tract (n = 1330). PATIENTS: A mix of inpatients and outpatients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. MEASUREMENTS: A Bayesian hierarchical model was fitted to estimate the false-negative rate by day since exposure and symptom onset. RESULTS: Over the 4 days of infection before the typical time of symptom onset (day 5), the probability of a false-negative result in an infected person decreases from 100% (95% CI, 100% to 100%) on day 1 to 67% (CI, 27% to 94%) on day 4. On the day of symptom onset, the median false-negative rate was 38% (CI, 18% to 65%). This decreased to 20% (CI, 12% to 30%) on day 8 (3 days after symptom onset) then began to increase again, from 21% (CI, 13% to 31%) on day 9 to 66% (CI, 54% to 77%) on day 21. LIMITATION: Imprecise estimates due to heterogeneity in the design of studies on which results were based. CONCLUSION: Care must be taken in interpreting RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection-particularly early in the course of infection-when using these results as a basis for removing precautions intended to prevent onward transmission. If clinical suspicion is high, infection should not be ruled out on the basis of RT-PCR alone, and the clinical and epidemiologic situation should be carefully considered.

Due to its high transmissibility, many young university students have had to carry out their academic activities in mandatory social isolation, which could generate excessive anxiety. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the anxiety levels in Peruvian dentistry students developed during COVID-19 mandatory social isolation. Materials and Methods: An analytical, observational, and transversal study was carried out in 403 dentistry students in the last two years from three Peruvian universities from May to July 2020. The Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale was used to detect anxiety symptoms and their respective diagnoses. A logit model was used to evaluate the association of the variables: Age group (X1), gender (X2), type of university (X3), and marital status (X4), with the anxiety levels of the students, considering a p-value less than 0.05. Results: The prevalence of anxiety resulted in 56.8% (95% confidence interval (CI): 51.9-61.7) of 403 dentistry students. According to the multivariate logistic regression analysis, the type of university was the only variable that demonstrated to have a significant influence on the development of anxiety with an odds ratio (OR = 1.98;CI: 1.29-3.02);whereas the other variables such as age group (OR = 0.77;CI: 0.49-1.20), gender (OR = 1.15;CI: 0.72-1.84), and marital status (OR = 0.75;CI: 0.35-1.60) were not considered factors that influenced the development of anxiety. Conclusion: More than a half of the Peruvian dentistry students from three universities showed mild-To-severe anxiety levels. Students from a private university have a 98% higher chance of developing anxiety in comparison to students from public universities. Other variables such as gender, age group, or marital status were not considered influencing factors to develop anxiety. © 2021 Journal of International Society of Preventive and Community Dentistry.","Cayo-Rojas, C.

This study aims to estimate patient and health system costs of managing pregnancy and birth-related complications in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was conducted to identify costing studies published and unpublished, from January 2000 to May 2019. The search was done in Pubmed, EMBASE, Cinahl, and Web of Science databases and grey literature. The study was registered in PROSPERO with registration No. CRD42019119316. All costs were converted to 2018 US dollars using relevant Consumer Price Indices. RESULTS: Out of 1652 studies identified, 48 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The included studies were of moderate to high quality. Spontaneous vaginal delivery cost patients and health systems between USD 6-52 and USD 8-73, but cesarean section costs between USD 56-377 and USD 80-562, respectively. Patient and health system costs of abortion range between USD 11-66 and USD 40-298, while post-abortion care costs between USD 21-158 and USD 46-151, respectively. The patient and health system costs for managing a case of eclampsia range between USD 52-231 and USD 123-186, while for maternal hemorrhage they range between USD 65-196 and USD 30-127, respectively. Patient cost for caring low-birth weight babies ranges between USD 38-489 while the health system cost was estimated to be USD 514. CONCLUSION: This is the first systematic review to compile comprehensive up-to-date patient and health system costs of managing pregnancy and birth-related complications in sub-Saharan Africa. It indicates that these costs are relatively high in this region and that patient costs were largely catastrophic relative to a 10 % of average national per capita income.","Mori, Amani Thomas; Binyaruka, Peter; Hangoma, Peter; Robberstad, Bjarne; Sandoy, Ingvild",Health Econ Rev,18,24

Liver graft dysfunction may be a rare complication. Some patients complain about the post-COVID-19 syndrome. The aim of this study was to assess medium and short-term outcomes in liver transplant patients. Patients and methods: A retrospective case series was performed at a tertiary referral center. We screened 845 patients who had liver transplant (LT) in our center. All consecutive LT patients with COVID-19 during the Spanish outbreak from March 2020 to April 2021, were included. Demographics, pre-existing comorbidities, clinical and radiological data of COVID-19 infection, complications and liver graft function were assessed at diagnosis and 3-month follow-up. Results: Overall, 20 LT patients were diagnosed with confirmed COVID-19. We included 16 patients that met the inclusion criteria, 8 nonhospitalised (50%) and 8 (50%) hospitalised patients were analyzed. The median follow-up was 5.33 months (IQR 3.06-8.26). One patient died during the follow-up. All patients presented some grade of respiratory or functional symptoms. Dyspnoea and fatigue were the most prevalent symptoms during the 3-months follow-up. No Liver graft dysfunction were reported despite of partial immunosuppression withdrawal in 4 patients (25%). One patient had cardiovascular complications. Conclusions: Our results suggest the presence of post-COVID-19 syndrome with mild residual physical and psychological dysfunction in this subgroup of patients at 3-month after COVID-19. However, no cases of loss or liver graft dysfunction were reported.","Tejedor-Tejada, Javier; Fuentes-Valenzuela, Esteban; Alonso-Martin, Carmen; Almohalla-Alvarez, Carolina; Garcia-Pajares, Felix",,18,31

It is believed that fluid dynamic and thermodynamic behavior differ significantly at these scales from the bulk. From a materials perspective, it is important to be able to create complex structures at the nanometer scale, reproducibly, so that the fluid behavior may be studied. New advances in nanoscale-resolution 3D-printing offer opportunities to achieve this goal. In particular, additive manufacturing with two-photon polymerization allows creation of intricate structures. Using this technology, a creation of the first nano-3D-printed digital (shale) rock is reported. In this paper, focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) nano-tomography image dataset was used to reconstruct a high-resolution digital rock 3D model of a Marcellus Shale rock sample. Porosity of this 3D model has been characterized and its connected/effective pore system has been extracted and nano-3D-printed.

Compared to the age-matched NCs, both young and old male and female non-comorbid COVID-19 patients had lower lymphocyte counts and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) concentration, and only young male and female patients had lower neutrophil counts. Compared to young patients, both old males and females had significantly higher plasma ALT and AST concentrations. Compared to young and old females, age-matched males had higher plasma ALT and AST concentrations, but only young males had higher C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration. Compared to females, old males, but not young males, showed higher incidence of critical illness. Compared to young patients, old females had more leukocyte and neutrophil counts above the normal upper limit and B cell count below the normal lower limit (NLL), while old males had more lymphocyte and natural killer (NK) cell counts below the NLL. No sex or age associations with B cell and NK cell counts were observed. However, there were age-dependent decreases in CD8+ T-cell counts in both male and female COVID-19 patients. Age was negatively associated with CD8+ T cell counts but positively associated with neutrophil count, CRP, ALT, and AST concentrations, and sex (females) was negatively associated with neutrophil count, CRP, ALT, and AST concentrations. The present study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection mainly induced 1) beneficial sex (female)-related differences regarding reduced COVID-19 disease severity and negative associations with inflammatory responses and liver damage, and 2) harmful age-related differences relating to negative associations with CD8+ T cell count and positive associations with inflammatory responses and liver damage. Thus, sex and age are biological variables that should be considered in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.","Jin, Shengwei; An, Hui; Zhou, Tong; Li, Ting; Xie, Mengzhen; Chen, Saijing; Chen, Chengshui; Ying, Binyu; Xu, Zhangye; Li, Xiaokun; Li, Ming",PLoS Pathog,18,1

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The hood has iris-port openings for access to the patient, and an opening large enough for a patient's head and upper torso. The top of the hood is a high-efficiency particulate air filter connected to a blower to apply negative pressure. We determined the aerosol penetration from outside to inside in laboratory experiments. RESULTS: The penetration of particles from within the hood to the breathing zones of HCWs outside the hood was near 10-4 (0.01%) in the 200-400 nm size range, and near 10-3 (0.1%) for smaller particles. Penetration values for particles in the 500 nm-5 µm range were below 10-2 (1%). Fluorometric analysis of deposited fluorescein particles on the personal protective equipment of an HCW revealed that negative pressure reduces particle deposition both outside and inside the hood. CONCLUSIONS: We find that negative pressure hoods can be effective controls to mitigate aerosol exposure to HCWs, while simultaneously allowing access to patients.","Phu, Hai-Thien; Park, Yensil; Andrews, Austin J; Marabella, Ian; Abraham, Asish; Mimmack, Reid; Olson, Bernard A; Chaika, Jonathan; Floersch, Eugene; Remskar, Mojca; Hume, Janet R; Fischer, Gwenyth A; Belani, Kumar; Hogan, Christopher J",Am J Infect Control,18,1

In this unprecedented situation, the cross approach and interaction between the French pharmacovigilance network and French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM) has been optimized to provide a real-time safety related to COVID-19 vaccines. Every week, pair of regional pharmacovigilance centers gathered safety data from the French pharmacovigilance network, to acutely expertise all the adverse drug reactions (ADRs) reported with each COVID-19 vaccine within a direct circuit with ANSM. Results of this expertise are presented and discussed with ANSM in order to raise safety signals and take appropriate measures if necessary. These reports are then published online. At the 25th of March 2021, more than 9 815 000 doses were injected and 20,265 ADRs were reported, mostly non-serious (76%).

The study hypothesizes that the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 patients depends on the urban population, rural population, number of persons older than 50, population density, and poverty rate. A log-linear model is used to test the stated hypothesis, with the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 patients up to period t as a dependent variable and demographic factors as an independent variable. The policy effectiveness indicator is calculated by taking the difference of the COVID rank of the ith state based on the predicted model and the actual COVID rank of the ith state. Our study finds that the urban population significantly impacts the spread of COVID-19. On the other hand, demographic factors such as rural population, density, and age structure do not impact the spread of COVID-19 significantly.

For new viruses such as Covid-19, the epidemiology driving the modelling process may not be well known and model estimation with limited data may be unreliable. With this motivation in mind, the new paradigm described here is data-driven and, to a large extent, we avoid modelling difficulties by concentrating on just two key quantities which are common to pandemics: the doubling time, denoted by $d(k)$ and the peak day denoted by $\theta(k)$. Our numerical studies to date suggest that our appealingly simple model can provide a reasonable fit to real data.

Lack of health insurance coverage and inadequate coverage are important reasons for high out-of-pocket health expenditures. There are many Public Health Insurance Programs offered by the Government that cover the cost of hospitalization for the people below poverty line (BPL), but their coverage is still not complete. The objective of this research is to examine the effect of Public Health Insurance Programs for the Poor on hospitalizations and inpatient Out-of-Pocket costs. METHODS: Data from the recent national survey by the National Sample Survey Organization, Social Consumption in Health 2014 are used. Propensity score matching was used to identify comparable non-enrolled individuals for individuals enrolled in health insurance programs. Binary logistic regression model, Tobit model, and a Two-part model were used to study the effects of enrolment under Public Health Insurance Programs for the Poor on the incidence of hospitalizations, length of hospitalization, and Out-of- Pocket payments for inpatient care. RESULTS: There were 64,270 BPL people in the sample. Individuals enrolled in health insurance for the poor have 1.21 higher odds of incidence of hospitalization compared to matched poor individuals without the health insurance coverage. Enrollment under the poor people health insurance program did not have any effect on length of hospitalization and inpatient Out-of-Pocket health expenditures. Logistic regression model showed that chronic illness, household size, and age of the individual had significant effects on hospitalization incidence. Tobit model results showed that individuals who had chronic illnesses and belonging to other backward social group had significant effects on hospital length of stay. Tobit model showed that days of hospital stay, education and age of patient, using a private hospital for treatment, admission in a paying ward, and having some specific comorbidities had significant positive effect on out-of-pocket costs. CONCLUSIONS: Enrolment in the public health insurance programs for the poor increased the utilization of inpatient health care. Health insurance coverage should be expanded to cover outpatient services to discourage overutilization of inpatient services. To reduce out-of-pocket costs, insurance needs to cover all family members rather than restricting coverage to a specific maximum defined.","Sriram, Shyamkumar; Khan, M Mahmud",BMC Health Serv Res,18,12

Breath monitoring is important for detection of severe diseases such as lung cancer or sleep apnea. In this work, we introduce a breath sensor based on a graphene oxide film deposited on silver interdigitated electrode and a flexible substrate. The graphene oxide film was then thermally annealed to partially reduce the graphene oxide. The measurements of sensor impedance carried out at different humidity levels show a high decrease by several orders of magnitudes by increasing the relative humidity. Sensitivity to humid air results from the high hydrophilicity of the graphene oxide due to its oxygen functional groups. The change of transport mechanism from Nyquist plot shows the change of the sensor impedance from the capacitive behavior to a semicircle of parallel resistance and capacitance. The sensors show an ultrahigh sensitivity to humidity at high humidity values, a very low response time of less than one second and an excellent repeatability of the measurements. For tracking human breathing, the reaction on natural breathing was acquired by a digital oscilloscope together with an IoT mobile application to visualize the results in real time and store them for further processing. The sensor performance shows that it is suitable as a noninvasive and flexible breath-monitoring sensor system. The proposed sensor can be a step to flexible and cheap wearable sensors for detection of human breath and hazardous breath airborne such as COVID-19. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Al-Hamry, A.; Panzardi, E.; Mugnaini, M.; Kanoun, O.","Smart Sensors, Measurement and Instrumentation",18,16

While these measures are necessary to slow virus transmission, little is known regarding the secondary health consequences of social distancing. The purpose of this study is to assess the proportion of injuries secondary to physical child abuse (PCA) at a level I pediatric trauma center during the Covid-19 pandemic. METHODS: A retrospective review of patients at our center was conducted to identify injuries caused by PCA in the month following the statewide closure of childcare facilities in Maryland. The proportion of PCA patients treated during the Covid-19 era were compared to the corresponding period in the preceding two years by Fisher's exact test. Demographics, injury profiles, and outcomes were described for each period. RESULTS: Eight patients with PCA injuries were treated during the Covid-19 period (13 % of total trauma patients), compared to four in 2019 (4 %, p < 0.05) and three in 2018 (3 %, p < 0.05). The median age of patients in the Covid-19 period was 11.5 months (IQR 6.8-24.5). Most patients were black (75 %) with public health insurance (75 %). All injuries were caused by blunt trauma, resulting in scalp/face contusions (63 %), skull fractures (50 %), intracranial hemorrhage (38 %), and long bone fractures (25 %). CONCLUSIONS: There was an increase in the proportion of traumatic injuries caused by physical child abuse at our center during the Covid-19 pandemic. Strategies to mitigate this secondary effect of social distancing should be thoughtfully implemented.","Kovler, Mark L; Ziegfeld, Susan; Ryan, Leticia M; Goldstein, Mitchell A; Gardner, Rebecca; Garcia, Alejandro V; Nasr, Isam W",Child Abuse Negl,18,26

SDM in mental health is hampered by lack of well-developed supporting tools. We describe an evidence-based patient decision aid (PDA) to facilitate SDM for treatment-resistant depression (TRD) following US National Quality Forum standards which are based upon the International Patient Decision Aid Standards (IPDAS). METHODS: A web-based PDA was developed by a multidisciplinary steering committee of clinicians, patient advocates, patients and a decision scientist. Development included creating content consistent with decision-making domains that are impacted by patient preference in TRD. Development was guided by literature review, group conference calls/discussions, patient and clinician interviews (N = 8), high and lower literacy focus groups (N = 11) and pilot study (N = 5). The PDA presents risk-benefit information on domains (e.g., effectiveness, mode of administration, side effects, cost) and includes values clarification exercises. Pilot study patients were administered the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) and Decision Self-Efficacy Scale (DSES) prior to and following PDA interaction and clinician SDM. RESULTS: During the pilot, prior to PDA interaction, mean (standard deviation) DCS score was 42.2 (14.4) and DSES score was 86.0 (14.6) out of 100. Following PDA interaction and SDM, DCS decreased (improved) to 28.1 (SD 4.1) and DSES increased to 95.5 (6.7). All patients endorsed that the PDA helped them to: recognize pros and cons of options; understand how treatments were administered, possible side-effects, and likelihood of benefit; recognize what was important relative to the decision; organize thoughts and prepare for a discussion with their clinician. CONCLUSIONS: This PDA may support SDM in TRD. A future trial to determine impact of the present SMD on decision-making quality is warranted. It also highlights gaps in comparative effectiveness trials that could guide equitable shared decision-making.","Shillington, Alicia C; Langenecker, Scott A; Shelton, Richard C; Foxworth, Phyllis; Allen, Luis; Rhodes, Martha; Pesa, Jacqueline; Williamson, David; Rovner, Margaret Holmes",J Affect Disord,18,29

COVID-19-associated neutrophilia, increased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, aberrant neutrophil activation, and infiltration of neutrophils into lungs suggest that neutrophils are important players in the disease immunopathology. The main objective of this study was to assess the phenotypic and functional characteristics of neutrophils in COVID-19 patients, with particular focus on the interaction between neutrophils and T cells. We hypothesize that the altered functional characteristics of COVID-19 patient-derived neutrophils result in skewed Th1/Th17 adaptive immune response, thus contributing to disease pathology. The expansion of G-MDSC and immature forms of neutrophils was shown in the COVID-19 patients. In the COVID-19 neutrophil/T cell cocultures, neutrophils caused a strong polarity shift toward Th17, and, conversely, a reduction of IFNÎ³-producing Th1 cells. The Th17 promotion was NOS dependent. Neutrophils, the known modulators of adaptive immunity, skew the polarization of T cells toward the Th17 promotion and Th1 suppression in COVID-19 patients, contributing to the discoordinated orchestration of immune response against SARS-CoV-2. As IL-17 and other Th17-related cytokines have previously been shown to correlate with the disease severity, we suggest that targeting neutrophils and/or Th17 represents a potentially beneficial therapeutic strategy for severe COVID-19 patients.","Parackova, Zuzana; Bloomfield, Marketa; Klocperk, Adam; Sediva, Anna",J. leukoc. biol,18,25

Herein we describe the synthesis and characterization of entirely organic metal-free paramagnetic macromolecules based on biocompatible oligoethylene glycol dendrimers fully functionalized with 5 and 20 organic radicals (OEG Gn-PROXYL (n = 0, 1) radical dendrimers) with the aim to be used as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents. Conferring high water solubility on such systems is often a concern, especially in large generation dendrimers. Our approach to overcome such an issue in this study is by synthesizing dendrimers with highly water-soluble branches themselves. In this work, we show that the highly water-soluble OEG Gn-PROXYL (n = 0, 1) radical dendrimers obtained showed properties that convert them in good candidates to be studied as contrast agents for MRI applications like diagnosis and follow-up of infectious diseases, among others. Importantly, with the first generation radical dendrimer, a similar r1 relaxivity value (3.4 mM-1s-1) in comparison to gadolinium-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA) used in clinics (3.2 mM-1s-1, r.t. 7T) has been obtained, and it has been shown to not be cytotoxic, avoiding the toxicity risks associated with the unwanted accumulation of Gd in the body.","Zhang, Songbai; Lloveras, Vega; Pulido, Daniel; Liko, Flonja; Pinto, Luiz F; Albericio, Fernando; Royo, Miriam; Vidal-Gancedo, José",,18,24

Comprehensive assessment of the multifaceted antiviral Ab response is critical for diagnosis, differentiation of severity, and characterization of long-term immunity, especially as COVID-19 vaccines become available. Severe disease is associated with early, massive plasmablast responses. We developed a multiplex immunoassay from serum/plasma of acutely infected and convalescent COVID-19 patients and prepandemic and postpandemic healthy adults. We measured IgA, IgG, and/or IgM against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N), spike domain 1 (S1), S1-receptor binding domain (RBD) and S1-N-terminal domain. For diagnosis, the combined [IgA + IgG + IgM] or IgG levels measured for N, S1, and S1-RBD yielded area under the curve values &#8805;0.90. Virus-specific Ig levels were higher in patients with severe/critical compared with mild/moderate infections. A strong prozone effect was observed in sera from severe/critical patients-a possible source of underestimated Ab concentrations in previous studies. Mild/moderate patients displayed a slower rise and lower peak in anti-N and anti-S1 IgG levels compared with severe/critical patients, but anti-RBD IgG and neutralization responses reached similar levels at 2-4 mo after symptom onset. Measurement of the Ab responses in sera from 18 COVID-19-vaccinated patients revealed specific responses for the S1-RBD Ag and none against the N protein. This highly sensitive, SARS-CoV-2-specific, multiplex immunoassay measures the magnitude, complexity, and kinetics of the Ab response and can distinguish serum Ab responses from natural SARS-CoV-2 infections (mild or severe) and mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.","Haddad, Natalie S; Nguyen, Doan C; Kuruvilla, Merin E; Morrison-Porter, Andrea; Anam, Fabliha; Cashman, Kevin S; Ramonell, Richard P; Kyu, Shuya; Saini, Ankur Singh; Cabrera-Mora, Monica; Derrico, Andrew; Alter, David; Roback, John D; Horwath, Michael; O039,; Keefe, James B; Wu, Henry M; Wong, An-Kwok Ian; Dretler, Alexandra W; Gripaldo, Ria; Lane, Andrea N; Wu, Hao; Chu, Helen Y; Lee, Saeyun; Hernandez, Mindy; Engineer, Vanessa; Varghese, John; Patel, Rahul; Jalal, Anum; French, Victoria; Guysenov, Ilya; Lane, Christopher E; Mengistsu, Tesfaye; Normile, Katherine Elizabeth; Mnzava, Onike; Le, Sang; Sanz, Ignacio; Daiss, John L; Lee, F Eun-Hyung",Immunohorizons,18,16

Here we have examined how endocytic processing contributes to signalling by the single cytokine receptor, Domeless, in Drosophila melanogaster cells. We identify an evolutionarily conserved di-Leu motif that is required for Domeless internalisation and show that endocytosis is required for activation of a subset of Domeless targets. Our data indicate that endocytosis both qualitatively and quantitatively regulates Domeless signalling. STAT92E, the single STAT transcription factor in Drosophila, appears to be the target of endocytic regulation and our studies show that phosphorylation of STAT92E on Tyr704, while necessary, is not always sufficient for target transcription. Finally, we identify a conserved residue, Thr702, which is essential for Tyr704 phosphorylation. Taken together, our findings identify previously unknown aspects of JAK/STAT pathway regulation likely to play key roles in the spatial and temporal regulation of signalling in vivo.","Moore, Rachel; Vogt, Katja; Acosta Martin, Adelina E; Shire, Patrick; Zeidler, Martin; Smythe, Elizabeth",J. cell. sci,18,24

People with COVID-19 usually experience fever and have difficulty breathing. Unsupervised care to patients with respiratory problems will be the main reason for the rising death rate. Periodic linearly increasing frequency chirp, known as frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW), is one of the radar technologies with a low-power operation and high-resolution detection which can detect any tiny movement. In this study, we use FMCW to develop a non-contact medical device that monitors and classifies the breathing pattern in real time. Patients with a breathing disorder have an unusual breathing characteristic that cannot be represented using the breathing rate. Thus, we created an Xtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) classification model and adopted Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) feature extraction to classify the breathing pattern behavior. XGBoost is an ensemble machine-learning technique with a fast execution time and good scalability for predictions. In this study, MFCC feature extraction assists machine learning in extracting the features of the breathing signal. Based on the results, the system obtained an acceptable accuracy.

This forced many affected countries to take stringent measures such as complete lockdown, shutting down businesses and trade, as well as travel restrictions, which has had a tremendous economic impact. Therefore, having knowledge and foresight about how a country might be able to contain the spread of COVID-19 will be of paramount importance to the government, policy makers, business partners and entrepreneurs. To help social and administrative decision making, a model that will be able to forecast when a country might be able to contain the spread of COVID-19 is needed. RESULTS: The results obtained using our long short-term memory (LSTM) network-based model are promising as we validate our prediction model using New Zealand's data since they have been able to contain the spread of COVID-19 and bring the daily new cases tally to zero. Our proposed forecasting model was able to correctly predict the dates within which New Zealand was able to contain the spread of COVID-19. Similarly, the proposed model has been used to forecast the dates when other countries would be able to contain the spread of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The forecasted dates are only a prediction based on the existing situation. However, these forecasted dates can be used to guide actions and make informed decisions that will be practically beneficial in influencing the real future. The current forecasting trend shows that more stringent actions/restrictions need to be implemented for most of the countries as the forecasting model shows they will take over three months before they can possibly contain the spread of COVID-19.","Kumar, Shiu; Sharma, Ronesh; Tsunoda, Tatsuhiko; Kumarevel, Thirumananseri; Sharma, Alok",BMC Bioinformatics,18,21

MATERIAL AND METHODS: During 53 days of the COVID­19 related state of emergency with a lockdown (March 15-May 6, 2020) in the Republic of Serbia, as well as in the corresponding periods of 2018 and 2019, data on the daily sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ground-level ozone (O3) and particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) concentrations were analyzed. The total mortality data were analyzed to estimate the impact of the COVID­19 related lockdown measures on the burden of health in a given population, attributed to the outdoor air quality in the City of Novi Sad, using AirQ+ software. RESULTS: The average daily concentrations of PM2.5, NO2, PM10 and SO2 were reduced by 35%, 34%, 23% and 18%, respectively. In contrast, the average daily concentration of O3 increased by 8%, even if the primary precursors were reducing, thus representing a challenge for air quality management. In the City of Novi Sad, a reduction in the average daily PM2.5 concentration of 11.23 µg/m³ was significant, which resulted in a quantified number of avoided deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Air pollution in the City of Novi Sad had a chance to be improved due to some preventive measures related to the infectious disease (the COVID­19 related lockdown), which in turn was the mitigation measure to air pollution with positive public health effects. The confirmed positive effects of the improved air quality on public health could also include raising collective resistance to mass non-communicable and infectious diseases such as COVID­19 and reducing economic costs.

However, prolonged exposure to hyperoxia results in acute lung injury (ALI) and accumulation of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) in the airways. We previously showed that airway HMGB1 mediates hyperoxia-induced lung injury in a mouse model of ALI. Cholinergic signaling through the &#945;7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (&#945;7nAChR) attenuates several inflammatory conditions. The aim of this study was to determine whether 3-(2,4 dimethoxy-benzylidene)-anabaseine dihydrochloride, GTS-21, an &#945;7nAChR partial agonist, inhibits hyperoxia-induced HMGB1 accumulation in the airways and circulation, and consequently attenuates inflammatory lung injury. METHODS: Mice were exposed to hyperoxia (&#8805;99% O2) for 3 days and treated concurrently with GTS-21 (0.04, 0.4 and 4 mg/kg, i.p.) or the control vehicle, saline. RESULTS: The systemic administration of GTS-21 (4 mg/kg) significantly decreased levels of HMGB1 in the airways and the serum. Moreover, GTS-21 (4 mg/kg) significantly reduced hyperoxia-induced acute inflammatory lung injury, as indicated by the decreased total protein content in the airways, reduced infiltration of inflammatory monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils into the lung tissue and airways, and improved lung injury histopathology. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that GTS-21 can attenuate hyperoxia-induced ALI by inhibiting extracellular HMGB1-mediated inflammatory responses. This suggests that the &#945;7nAChR represents a potential pharmacological target for the treatment regimen of oxidative inflammatory lung injury in patients receiving oxygen therapy.","Sitapara, Ravikumar A; Gauthier, Alex G; Valdés-Ferrer, Sergio I; Lin, Mosi; Patel, Vivek; Wang, Mao; Martino, Ashley T; Perron, Jeanette C; Ashby, Charles R; Tracey, Kevin J; Pavlov, Valentin A; Mantell, Lin L",Mol Med,18,24

PEDV replication is completed and results in a large amount of RNA in the cytoplasm. Stress granules (SGs) are dynamic cytosolic RNA granules formed under various stress conditions, including viral infections. Several previous studies suggested that SGs were involved in the antiviral activity of host cells to limit viral propagation. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. This study aimed to delineate the molecular mechanisms regulating the SG response to PEDV infection. SG formation is induced early during PEDV infection, but as infection proceeds, this ability is lost and SGs disappear at late stages of infection (>18 h postinfection). PEDV infection resulted in the cleavage of Ras-GTPase-activating protein-binding protein 1 (G3BP1) mediated by caspase-8. Using mutational analysis, the PEDV-induced cleavage site within G3BP1 was identified, which differed from the 3C protease cleavage site previously identified. Furthermore, G3BP1 cleavage by caspase-8 at D168 and D169 was confirmed in vitro as well as in vivo The overexpression of cleavage-resistant G3BP1 conferred persistent SG formation and suppression of viral replication. Additionally, the knockdown of endogenous G3BP1 abolished SG formation and potentiated viral replication. Taken together, these data provide new insights into novel strategies in which PEDV limits the host stress response and antiviral responses and indicate that caspase-8-mediated G3BP1 cleavage is important in the failure of host defense against PEDV infection.IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses (CoVs) are drawing extensive attention again since the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019. CoVs are prone to variation and own the transmission capability by crossing the species barrier resulting in reemergence. How CoVs manipulate the antiviral responses of their hosts needs to be explored. Overall, the study provides new insight into how porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) impaired SG assembly by targeting G3BP1 via the host proteinase caspase-8. These findings enhanced the understanding of PEDV infection and might help identify new antiviral targets that could inhibit viral replication and limit the pathogenesis of PEDV.","Sun, Liumei; Chen, Huan; Ming, Xin; Bo, Zongyi; Shin, Hyun-Jin; Jung, Yong-Sam; Qian, Yingjuan",J. virol,18,1

METHODS: To assess the radiation leakage surrounding headshield and the radiation level after the beam stopper, measurements were made with GafChromic films. To evaluate the in-room radiation levels, the radiation leakage in the iso-center plane was measured with a large volume spherical ionization chamber (Exradin A6, Standard Imaging). A lead enclosure was constructed to shield the chamber from the low energy scatter radiation from the room. The radiation level at multiple locations was measured with the MLC fully closed and gantry at 0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270 and 315 degrees. The leakage radiation passing through multiple concrete slabs with various thickness was recorded in a narrow beam geometry to determine the tenth value layer (TVL). RESULTS: A uniform leakage (<0.05%) at 1m from electron beam line was measured surrounding the linac head with the max leakage measured at the top of the head enclosure. The highest radiation level (<0.08%) was measured near the edge of the beam stopper when projected to the measurement plane. The maximum radiation levels due to the head leakage at 15 locations inside the treatment room were recorded and a radiation map was plotted. The maximum leakage was measured at points that along the electron beam line while the gantry at 90 or 270 degree and at the end of head enclosure (0.314%, 0.4 m from electron beamline). The leakage TVL value is found to be 226 mm in a narrow beam geometry with the concrete density of 2.16g/cm3 or 134.6 lb/cu.ft. CONCLUSION: An overall uniform leakage was measured surrounding linac head. The beam stopper shields the primary radiation with the highest valued measured near the edge of beam stopper. The leakage TVL values are derived and lower than the values reported for conventional C-arm linac.","Cai, Bin; Laugeman, Eric; Hsu, HsinLu; Green, Olga; Knutson, Nels; Goddu, Murty; Mutic, Sasa; Du, Shuhua; Henke, Lauren; Kim, Hyun; Hugo, Geoffrey D",Med. phys,18,25

We (i) assessed associations between residential green space and cumulative incidence of, and relief from, loneliness over 4 years; and (ii) explored contingencies by age, sex, disability and cohabitation status. METHODS: Multilevel logistic regressions of change in loneliness status in 8049 city-dwellers between 2013 (baseline) and 2017 (follow-up) in the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia study. Associations with objectively measured discrete green-space buffers (e.g. parks) (<400, <800 and <1600 m) were adjusted for age, sex, disability, cohabitation status, children and socio-economic variables. Results were translated into absolute risk reductions in loneliness per 10% increase in urban greening. RESULTS: The absolute risk of loneliness rose from 15.9% to 16.9% over the 4 years; however, a 10% increase in urban greening within 1.6 km was associated with lower cumulative incident loneliness [odds ratio (OR) = 0.927, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.862 to 0.996; absolute risk reduction = 0.66%]. Stronger association was observed for people living alone (OR = 0.828, 95% CI = 0.725 to 0.944).

Compared with the <10% green-space reference group with 13.78% incident loneliness over 4 years and conservatively assuming no impact on incident loneliness, associations translated into absolute risk reductions of 1.70%, 2.26% and 2.72% within populations with 10-20%, 20-30% and >30% green space, respectively. These associations were stronger again for people living alone, with 10-20% (OR = 0.608, 95% CI = 0.448 to 0.826), 20-30% (OR = 0.649, 95% CI = 0.436 to 0.966) and >30% (OR = 0.480, 95% CI = 0.278 to 0.829) green space within 1600 m. No age, sex or disability-related contingencies, associations with green space within 400 or 800 m or relief from loneliness reported at baseline were observed. CONCLUSIONS: A lower cumulative incidence of loneliness was observed among people with more green space within 1600 m of home, especially for people living alone.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify influential nodes and highlight the hidden structural properties of the COVID-19 epidemic network, which we believe is central to prevention and control of the epidemic. METHODS: We first constructed a network of the COVID-19 epidemic among 31 provinces in mainland China; after some basic characteristics were revealed by the degree distribution, the k-core decomposition method was employed to provide static and dynamic evidence to determine the influential nodes and hierarchical structure. We then exhibited the influence power of the above nodes and the evolution of this power. RESULTS: Only a small fraction of the provinces studied showed relatively strong outward or inward epidemic transmission effects. The three provinces of Hubei, Beijing, and Guangzhou showed the highest out-degrees, and the three highest in-degrees were observed for the provinces of Beijing, Henan, and Liaoning. In terms of the hierarchical structure of the COVID-19 epidemic network over the whole period, more than half of the 31 provinces were located in the innermost core. Considering the correlation of the characteristics and coreness of each province, we identified some significant negative and positive factors. Specific to the dynamic transmission process of the COVID-19 epidemic, three provinces of Anhui, Beijing, and Guangdong always showed the highest coreness from the third to the sixth week; meanwhile, Hubei Province maintained the highest coreness until the fifth week and then suddenly dropped to the lowest in the sixth week. We also found that the out-strengths of the innermost nodes were greater than their in-strengths before January 27, 2020, at which point a reversal occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing our understanding of how epidemic networks form and function may help reduce the damaging effects of COVID-19 in China as well as in other countries and territories worldwide.","Qin, Lei; Wang, Yidan; Sun, Qiang; Zhang, Xiaomei; Shia, Ben-Chang; Liu, Chengcheng",JMIR Public Health Surveill,18,24

Healthcare workers that are in the front line face challenges with a shortage of personal protective equipment, high risk of contamination, low adherence to the social distancing measures by the population, low coronavirus testing with underestimation of cases, and also financial concerns due to the economic crisis in a developing country. This study compared the impact of COVID-19 pandemic among three categories of healthcare workers in Brazil: physicians, nurses, and dentists, about workload, income, protection, training, feelings, behavior, and level of concern and anxiety. The sample was randomly selected and a Google Forms questionnaire was sent by WhatsApp messenger. The survey comprised questions about jobs, income, workload, PPE, training for COVID-19 patient care, behavior and feelings during the pandemic. The number of jobs reduced for all healthcare workers in Brazil during the pandemic, but significantly more for dentists. The workload and income reduced to all healthcare workers. Most healthcare workers did not receive proper training for treating COVID-19 infected patients. Physicians and nurses were feeling more tired than usual. Most of the healthcare workers in all groups reported difficulties in sleeping during the pandemic. The healthcare workers reported a significant impact of COVID-19 pandemic in their income, workload and anxiety, with differences among physicians, nurses and dentists.","Cotrin, Paula; Moura, Wilana; Gambardela-Tkacz, Caroline Martins; Pelloso, Fernando Castilho; Santos, Lander Dos; Carvalho, Maria Dalva de Barros; Pelloso, Sandra Marisa; Freitas, Karina Maria Salvatore",Inquiry,18,22

It is an acute infectious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This severe disease is characterised by acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, coagulation dysfunction, and multiple organ dysfunction syndromes. Currently, no drugs or vaccines exist against the disease and the only course of treatment is symptom management involving mechanical ventilation, immune suppressants, and repurposed drugs. The severe form of the disease has a relatively high mortality rate. The last six months have seen an explosion of information related to the host receptors, virus transmission, virus structure-function relationships, pathophysiology, co-morbidities, immune response, treatment and the most promising vaccines. This review takes a critically comprehensive look at various aspects of the host-pathogen interaction in COVID-19. We examine the genomic aspects of SARS-CoV-2, modulation of innate and adaptive immunity, complement-triggered microangiopathy, and host transmission modalities. We also examine its pathophysiological impact during pregnancy, in addition to emphasizing various gaps in our knowledge. The lessons learnt from various clinical trials involving repurposed drugs have been summarised. We also highlight the rationale and likely success of the most promising vaccine candidates.","Varghese, Praveen Mathews; Tsolaki, Anthony G; Yasmin, Hadida; Shastri, Abhishek; Ferluga, Janez; Vatish, Manu; Madan, Taruna; Kishore, Uday",Immunobiology,18,16

However, systematic evidence on this subject is sparse. We aimed to investigate the rate of emergent hospital admissions, subsequent invasive treatments and comorbidities during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. METHODS AND RESULTS: This was a retrospective analysis of health insurance claims data from the second largest insurance fund in Germany, BARMER. Patients hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction, acute limb ischemia, aortic rupture, stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) between January 1, 2019, and May 31, 2020, were included. Admission rates per 100,000 insured, invasive treatments and comorbidities were compared from January-May 2019 (pre-COVID) to January-May 2020 (COVID). A total of 115,720 hospitalizations were included in the current analysis (51.3% females, mean age 72.9 years). Monthly admission rates declined from 78.6/100,000 insured (pre-COVID) to 70.6/100,000 (COVID). The lowest admission rate was observed in April 2020 (61.6/100,000). Administration rates for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (7.3-6.6), non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (16.8-14.6), acute limb ischemia (5.1-4.6), stroke (35.0-32.5) and TIA (13.7-11.9) decreased from pre-COVID to COVID. Baseline comorbidities and the percentage of these patients treated with interventional or open-surgical procedures remained similar over time across all entities. In-hospital mortality in hospitalizations for stroke increased from pre-COVID to COVID (8.5-9.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Admission rates for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular emergencies declined during the pandemic in Germany, while patients' comorbidities and treatment allocations remained unchanged. Further investigation is warranted to identify underlying reasons and potential implications on patients' outcomes.","Seiffert, Moritz; Brunner, Fabian J; Remmel, Marko; Thomalla, Götz; Marschall, Ursula; L039,; Hoest, Helmut; Acar, Laura; Debus, Eike S; Blankenberg, Stefan; Gerloff, Christian; Behrendt, Christian-Alexander",Clin Res Cardiol,18,1

Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) hospitalisation is a potentially traumatic experience, especially in severe cases. Furthermore, the unprecedented context of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic, with daily media bombardment about COVID-19 mortality, may have amplified life-threatening perception also in patients with moderate infection. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and risk factors of PTSD at 3-month follow-up in patients hospitalised for COVID-19 infection. DESIGN: In this cohort follow-up study conducted in a large Italian academic COVID-19 hospital, 115 recruited survivors were contacted by telephone 3 months after discharge to home care. The Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 was administered. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to analyse risk factors for the development of PTSD. KEY RESULTS: A total of 10.4% of the sample received a PCL-5-based diagnosis of PTSD. Other 8.6% of the sample received a diagnosis of subthreshold PTSD, which leads to significant levels of distress and impairment. Multivariate regression analysis indicated that previous psychiatric diagnosis (odds ratio (OR) = 6.3, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.7-78.6, p < 0.001) and obesity (OR = 3.51, 95% CI: 1.4-857.9, p = 0.03) were risk factors for developing PTSD. Chronic pulmonary diseases approached significance as a risk factor (OR = 6.03, 95% CI: 1.0-37.1, p = 0.053). Male sex was a protective factor (OR=0.04, 95% CI: 0.0-0.041, p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: PTSD and subthreshold PTSD rates in patients hospitalised for COVID-19 are worrying. Female sex and pre-existing mental disorders are established risk factors for PTSD, while the prospective association with obesity needs further investigation. Clinicians treating COVID-19 should consider screening for PTSD at follow-up assessments in patients discharged from the hospital.","Tarsitani, Lorenzo; Vassalini, Paolo; Koukopoulos, Alexia; Borrazzo, Cristian; Alessi, Federica; Di Nicolantonio, Chiara; Serra, Riccardo; Alessandri, Francesco; Ceccarelli, Giancarlo; Mastroianni, Claudio Maria; d039,; Ettorre, Gabriella",J Gen Intern Med,18,16

It is one of the larger NATO installations in Afghanistan, and with its location being one of the main hubs for international transit, the base has been at the frontline since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Hamid Karzai International Airport base commanders and medical staff have been at the forefront, continually developing policies and procedures to mitigate the pandemic in a deployed setting. MATERIAL AND METHODS: On base, approximately 4,000 people from 58 different nations lived within 0.5 km2. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was made by the detection of nucleic acid from the SARS-CoV-2 virus in nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs using real-time polymerase chain reaction (BioFire or GeneXpert). Serological tests (detecting IgM and IgG antibodies) were used as a screening tool. Data were reported from April 1 to September 12, 2020. RESULTS: Three thousand four hundred and sixty-six PCR tests were run in the reported period. Four hundred and seventy-eight positive cases were identified. Of these, only 106 reported symptoms. Seventy-eight presented spontaneously to the emergency room, while the remaining positive cases were identified as a result of aggressive testing of close contacts, base screening and surge testing. Twenty-two patients required oxygen treatment. One patient required mechanical ventilation and later died after strategic evacuation. DISCUSSION: Mitigation of COVID-19 was achieved by measures to reduce the spread of the virus, measures to reduce the population, and a medical response plan. To manage the logistic burden of isolating and quarantining a large portion of the population, a multinational and multidisciplinary COVID Task Force was formed. CONCLUSIONS: In a military population of mostly young and healthy individuals, the majority of COVID-positive patients will have fewer symptoms, and therefore, the aggressive screening of asymptomatic personnel is necessary. Outbreaks of COVID-19 in a military base could have a detrimental impact on missions but may be contained and controlled with quarantine, isolation, and aggressive contact tracing.","Medby, Christian; Clifford, Sandra Larsen; Norquay, Miranda; Hansen, Therese Killi; Gurney, Jennifer",Mil. med,18,29

MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred twenty-seven adult COVID-19 patients underwent chest CT scans on a CT scanner using the same scan protocol except with the manual positioning (MP group) for the initial scan and an AI-based automatic positioning method (AP group) for the follow-up scan. Radiation dose, patient positioning time, and off-center distance of the two groups were recorded and compared. Image noise and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were assessed by three experienced radiologists and were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The AP operation was successful for all patients in the AP group and reduced the total positioning time by 28% compared with the MP group. Compared with the MP group, the AP group had significantly less patient off-center distance (AP 1.56 cm ± 0.83 vs. MP 4.05 cm ± 2.40, p < 0.001) and higher proportion of positioning accuracy (AP 99% vs. MP 92%), resulting in 16% radiation dose reduction (AP 6.1 mSv ± 1.3 vs. MP 7.3 mSv ± 1.2, p < 0.001) and 9% image noise reduction in erector spinae and lower noise and higher SNR for lesions in the pulmonary peripheral areas. CONCLUSION: The AI-based automatic positioning and centering in CT imaging is a promising new technique for reducing radiation dose and optimizing imaging workflow and image quality in imaging the chest. KEY POINTS: â¢ The AI-based automatic positioning (AP) operation was successful for all patients in our study. â¢ AP method reduced the total positioning time by 28% compared with the manual positioning (MP). â¢ AP method had less patient off-center distance and higher proportion of positioning accuracy than MP method, resulting in 16% radiation dose reduction and 9% image noise reduction in erector spinae.","Gang, Yadong; Chen, Xiongfeng; Li, Huan; Wang, Hanlun; Li, Jianying; Guo, Ying; Zeng, Junjie; Hu, Qiang; Hu, Jinxiang; Xu, Haibo",Eur Radiol,18,10

Design/methodology/approach Drawing on legitimacy theory, this study analysis documents regarding the communication strategies of New Zealand (NZ)'s Prime Minster, Jacinda Ardern, during the COVID-19 pandemic, in order to extract lessons for organizations. The authors contrast Ardern's communications with those of Donald Trump, the President of the United States (US), as evidence that leaders do not necessarily follow these strategies. Findings The findings show that clear, consistent and credible communications, backed up by open access to the numerical data that underlie the decisions, ensure that these decisions are seen as legitimate, ensure that citizens/stakeholders feel leaders are accountable and believe in the necessity of measures taken and that they conform to the guidelines and rules. By contrast, the strategy of attempting to withhold information, blaming others, refusing to acknowledge that there are problems and refusing to address problems lead to non-conformance by citizens/stakeholders. Business leaders could apply these lessons to the management of crises in their organizations to ensure buy-in from employees and other stakeholders. Leaders and organizations that follow these communication strategies can emerge in a stronger position than before the crisis. Research limitations/implications This paper develops a theoretical framework of strategies aimed at maintaining and disrupting legitimacy among key audiences, which can be used in future research. Practical implications This paper highlighting how organizations and organizational leaders can best communicate with stakeholders using accounting, thus coming across as being accountable during crisis times. Social implications The legitimacy maintenance strategies outlined in this paper ensures that stakeholders feel leaders and the organizations they represent hold themselves accountable. Originality/value This paper outlines the lessons that an organization can learn from communication strategies adopted by governments during the COVID-19 crisis. The paper extends legitimacy theory by explicitly acknowledging the ability to disrupt the legitimacy of others and including this in the authors' theoretical framework.","de Villiers, C.; Molinari, M.",Accounting Auditing &amp; Accountability Journal,18,2

It asks: What actions is the government taking in order to care for cultural organisations, cultural workers and the communities they serve? What local understandings of culture underpin such policy decisions? And finally, what have been the results and responses to such policies so far? In order to answer these questions we focus mainly on a central programme of the National Ministry of Culture, Puntos de Cultura [Points of Culture], which provides support to community cultural projects. As a notable, institutionalised example of the Latin American tradition of community arts, a focus on Puntos de Cultura provides an entry point to Latin American perspectives on the social and caring role of culture, thus allowing a contextualised analysis of culture and care at a time of crisis.","Serafini, Paula; Novosel, Noelia",Cult.

Whether myositis patients with SS differ from myositis patients without SS in terms of the characteristics of the myositis is currently unknown. Anti-cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase 1 A (cN1A) has recently been proposed as a biomarker for IBM but is also frequent in SS. Whether anti-cN1A is independently associated with IBM is still an open question. We aimed to assess the significance of SS and anti-cN1A in myositis patients. METHODS: Cumulative data on all myositis patients (EULAR/ACR 2017 criteria) screened for SS (ACR/EULAR 2016 criteria) in a single center were analyzed. Ninety-nine patients were included, covering the whole spectrum of EULAR/ACR 2017 myositis subgroups and with a median follow-up of 6 years [range 1.0-37.5]. The 34 myositis patients with SS (myositis/SS+) were compared with the 65 myositis patients without SS (myositis/SS-). RESULTS: IBM was present in 24% of the myositis/SS+ patients vs 6% of the myositis/SS- group (p = 0.020). None of the IBM patients responded to treatment, whether they had SS or not. Anti-cN1A was more frequent in myositis/SS+ patients (38% vs 6%, p = 0.0005), independently of the higher prevalence of IBM in this group (multivariate p-value: 0.02). Anti-cN1A antibody specificity for IBM was 0.96 [95% CI, 0.87-0.99] in the myositis SS- group but dropped to 0.70 [95% CI, 0.48-0.85] in the myositis SS/+ group. INTERPRETATION: In myositis patients, SS is associated with IBM and with anti-cN1A antibodies, independently of the IBM diagnosis. As a consequence, anti-cN1A has limited specificity for IBM in myositis patients with SS.","Levy, Dan; Nespola, Benoit; Giannini, Margherita; Felten, Renaud; Severac, François; Varoquier, Coralie; Rinagel, Marina; Korganow, Anne-Sophie; Martin, Thierry; Poindron, Vincent; Maurier, Francois; Chereih, Hassam; Bouldoires, Bastien; Hervier, Baptiste; Lenormand, Cedric; Chatelus, Emmanuel; Geny, Bernard; Sibilia, Jean; Arnaud, Laurent; Gottenberg, Jacques-Eric; Meyer, Alain",Rheumatology (Oxford),18,0

The clinical utility and prognostic value of echocardiography in COVID-19 inpatients is not clearly defined. We aim to identify echocardiographic parameters that are associated with 30-day clinical outcomes secondary to COVID-19 hospitalization. Methods: This retrospective cohort study was conducted in a large tertiary hospital in New York City during the COVID-19 pandemic. It included 214 adult inpatients with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 on nasopharyngeal swab and had a transthoracic echocardiogram performed during the index hospitalization. Primary outcome was 30-day all-cause inpatient mortality. Secondary outcomes were 30-day utilization of mechanical ventilator support, vasopressors, or renal replacement therapy. Results: Mild right ventricular systolic dysfunction (odds ratio (OR): 3.51, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.63–7.57, p = 0.001), moderate to severe right ventricular systolic dysfunction (OR: 7.30, 95% CI: 2.20–24.25, p = 0.001), pulmonary hypertension (OR: 5.39, 95% CI: 1.96–14.86, p = 0.001), and moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation (OR: 3.92, 95% CI: 1.71–9.03, p = 0.001) were each associated with increased odds of 30-day all-cause inpatient mortality. Pulmonary hypertension and moderate to severe right ventricular dysfunction were each associated with increased odds of 30-day utilization of mechanical ventilator support and vasopressors. Conclusions: Right ventricular dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, and moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation were associated with increased odds for 30-day inpatient mortality.

We developed a bioluminescence-based bioreporter to interrogate the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 viral spike (S) protein and its host entry receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The bioreporter assay is based on a nanoluciferase complementation reporter, composed of two subunits, large BiT and small BiT, fused to the S receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and ACE2 ectodomain, respectively. Using this bioreporter, we uncovered critical host and viral determinants of the interaction, including a role for glycosylation of asparagine residues within the RBD in mediating successful viral entry. We also demonstrate the importance of N-linked glycosylation to the RBD's antigenicity and immunogenicity. Our study demonstrates the versatility of our bioreporter in mapping key residues mediating viral entry as well as screening inhibitors of the ACE2-RBD interaction. Our findings point toward targeting RBD glycosylation for therapeutic and vaccine strategies against SARS-CoV-2.","Azad, Taha; Singaravelu, Ragunath; Taha, Zaid; Jamieson, Taylor R; Boulton, Stephen; Crupi, Mathieu J F; Martin, Nikolas T; Brown, Emily E F; Poutou, Joanna; Ghahremani, Mina; Pelin, Adrian; Nouri, Kazem; Rezaei, Reza; Marshall, Christopher Boyd; Enomoto, Masahiro; Arulanandam, Rozanne; Alluqmani, Nouf; Samson, Reuben; Gingras, Anne-Claude; Cameron, D William; Greer, Peter A; Ilkow, Carolina S; Diallo, Jean-Simon; Bell, John C",Mol. ther,18,33

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of mandala colouring on the anxiety of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. In this randomized controlled clinical trial, 70 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were randomly divided between the intervention and control groups. Standard care was provided for both groups. The intervention group spent 30 min/day for six consecutive days performing mandala colouring. Patient anxiety was measured prior and subsequent to the intervention in both groups using the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Data were analysed using SPSS software version 25. The mean anxiety score was not significantly different between the two groups before the intervention (P = 0.08). Subsequent to the intervention, the mean anxiety score in the intervention and control groups was 44.05 ± 4.67 and 67.85 ± 6.25, respectively, indicating a statistically significant (P = 0.0001) decrease in the anxiety measured among the intervention group as compared with that of the control group. The results of this study show that 30 min of mandala colouring daily is an effective strategy for reducing anxiety in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Mandala colouring can complement routine treatment and provides a non-pharmaceutical option for decreasing patient anxiety.","Khademi, Fatemeh; Rassouli, Maryam; Rafiei, Fatemeh; Moayedi, Siamak; Torres, Mercedes; Marzban, Negin; Haji, Ensieh; Golitaleb, Mohamad",Int. j. ment. health nurs,18,31

The purpose of this study is to quantify the reinstatement of elective orthopedic surgeries of our institution in Shanghai, China, and share our first-hand experiences of how this region is managing the post-outbreak period. METHODS: The number of patients receiving elective orthopedic surgeries was analyzed in the timeframe of 8 months since the start of the pandemic (from January 20 to September 16) and compared with the patients receiving the same treatment during the same period in 2019. And a detailed workflow for handling patients about to receive elective surgeries in the COVID-19 post-outbreak period was described. RESULTS: The number of the selective surgeries in the first 3 months only accounted for 31.72% of the same period in 2019 (p = 0.0031), and the ratio reached 97.47% when it came to the last 5 months (p > 0.9999). The selective surgeries even surpassed the pre-epidemic level in months 7 and 8. And the difference of the surgeries was not significant in the whole eight observed months between 2019 and 2020 (p = 0.1526). No health care providers or hospitalized patients in orthopedic departments in Shanghai have been infected nosocomially.

However, the mechanism underlying severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced NET formation has not yet been elucidated. Here we show that 2 viral proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2, the nucleocapsid protein and the whole spike protein, induce NET formation from neutrophils. NET formation was ROS-independent and was completely inhibited by the spleen tyrosine kinase inhibition. The inhibition of p38 MAPK, protein kinase C, and JNK signaling pathways also inhibited viral protein-induced NET formation. Our findings demonstrate one method by which SARS-CoV-2 evades innate immunity and provide a potential target for therapeutics to treat patients with severe COVID-19.","Youn, Y. J.; Lee, Y.

Due to the lack of effective treatments for COVID-19, it becomes imperative to assess the geographical differences and trends in the current clinical care and outcomes of COVID-19 in pregnant women. METHODS: A PubMed search was performed to screen articles reporting therapeutics and outcomes of confirmed COVID-19 in pregnant women prior to August 27, 2020. We performed searches, quality assessments of eligible studies, extracted and reported data according to PRISMA guidelines. Meta-analyses and cumulative meta-analyses of proportions were performed for estimating each outcome and their pattern over time respectively. RESULTS: One thousand two hundred thirty nine pregnant women with COVID-19 from 66 studies were analyzed. In case series analysis reflecting average-risk patients, the proportion of oxygen support, antibiotics, antivirals, and plasma therapy administration except for hydroxychloroquine was substantially higher in Asian studies (55, 78, 80, 6, and 0%) compared to the US (7, 1, 12, 0, and 7%) or European (33, 12, 14, 1, and 26%) studies, respectively. The highest preterm birth and the average length of hospital stay (35%, 11.9 days) were estimated in Asian studies compared to the US studies (13%, 9.4 days) and European studies (29%, 7.3 days), respectively. Even in case reports reflecting severe cases, the use of antivirals and antibiotics was higher in Asian studies compared to the US, Latin American, and European studies. A significant decline in the use of most therapeutics along with adverse outcomes of COVID-19 in pregnant women was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Geographical differences in therapeutic practice of COVID-19 were observed with differential rates of maternal and clinical outcomes. Minimizing the use of some therapeutics particularly antibiotics, antivirals, oxygen therapy, immunosuppressants, and hydroxychloroquine by risk stratification and careful consideration may further improve maternal and clinical outcomes.","Dubey, Pallavi; Thakur, Bhaskar; Reddy, Sireesha; Martinez, Carla A; Nurunnabi, Md; Manuel, Sharron L; Chheda, Sadhana; Bracamontes, Christina; Dwivedi, Alok K",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,18,16

The data obtained from the perception study was further complemented through phone interviews. Results: The study found that the pandemic has not affected all mothers uniformly; rather, the intensity of its impact varied depending on factors such as the occupation of mothers and their husbands and their family pattern. Despite such variation, all mothers experienced a subsequent increase in workload, challenges while availing routine health facilities and higher levels of stress, anxiety, depression and certain behavioural changes. Conclusion: However, the worst affected have been the mothers belonging to the lower socio-economic strata because the pandemic has made them and their husbands jobless, leading them towards an uncertain future.","Ehsan, Shah Md Azimul; Jahan, Fairooz",Z Gesundh Wiss,18,27

Peri-urban settings in Kenya have been reported to exhibit higher rates of maternal death during labor and childbirth as compared to the general Kenyan population. Although research indicates that women in Kenya have increased access to facility-based birth in recent years, a small percentage still give birth outside of the health facility due to access challenges and poor maternal health service quality. Most studies assessing facility-based births have focused on the sociodemographic determinants of birthing location. Few studies have assessed women's user experiences and perceptions of quality of care during childbirth. Understanding women's experiences can provide different stakeholders with strategies to structure the provision of maternity care to be person-centered and to contribute to improvements in women's satisfaction with health services and maternal health outcomes. METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted, whereby 70 women from the peri-urban area of Embakasi in the East side of Nairobi City in Kenya were interviewed. Respondents were aged 18 to 49 years and had delivered in a health facility in the preceding six weeks. We conducted in-depth interviews with women who gave birth at both public and private health facilities. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and translated for analysis. Braune and Clarke's guidelines for thematic analysis were used to generate themes from the interview data. RESULTS: Four main themes emerged from the analysis. Women had positive experiences when care was person-centered-i.e. responsive, dignified, supportive, and with respectful communication. They had negative experiences when they were mistreated, which was manifested as non-responsive care (including poor reception and long wait times), non-dignified care (including verbal and physical abuse lack of privacy and confidentiality), lack of respectful communication, and lack of supportive care (including being denied companions, neglect and abandonment, and poor facility environment). CONCLUSION: To sustain the gains in increased access to facility-based births, there is a need to improve person-centered care to ensure women have positive facility-based childbirth experiences.","Oluoch-Aridi, Jackline; Afulani, Patience A; Guzman, Danice B; Makanga, Cindy; Miller-Graff, Laura",Reprod Health,18,1

The four authors of this article, all of them instructors on the front line of the youth crisis in adult education, explore the broader context of non-governmental organisation (NGO) management and privatised HSE exams. In their research and their reflections, they found that the pandemic exacerbated existing economic and social inequalities, with both pre-pandemic and current delivery of their HSE programme failing to address the survival needs of a population which has long been living in crisis. Juxtaposing relevant youth-in-crisis literature with narratives both from before the pandemic and whilst living through it, the authors of this article discuss the funding and institutional constraints around the environment in which they teach. Their case study sheds light on competing priorities within the non-profit education landscape, highlighting both pitfalls and successes in HSE curriculum and administration.

A cross-sectional study was carried out using an online questionnaire that evaluated demographic variables, social capital, perceived stress related to coronavirus disease, depression risk, insomnia risk, and suicide risk. SC was taken as an independent variable, and symptoms indicating psychological distress were considered as dependent variables. A group of 700 adults aged between 18 and 76 years (M = 37, SD = 13) participated in the survey. Low SC was associated with depression risk (odds ratio [OR] = 2.00, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.34-2.97), elevated suicide risk (OR = 2.62, 95% CI = 1.40-4.91) high perceived stress related to coronavirus disease (OR = 2.08 95% CI, 1.15-3.76), and insomnia risk (OR = 2.42, 95% CI = 1.69-3.47). In conclusion, low CS was associated with indicators of psychological distress.

While #MeToo has been praised for providing support for self-disclosures of harassment or violence and shifting societal response, it has also been criticized for exemplifying how women of color have been discounted for their historical contributions to and excluded from feminist movements. Through an analysis of over 600,000 tweets from over 256,000 unique users, we examine online #MeToo conversations across gender and racial/ethnic identities and the topics that each demographic emphasized. We found that tweets authored by white women were overrepresented in the movement compared to other demographics, aligning with criticism of unequal representation. We found that intersected identities contributed differing narratives to frame the movement, co-opted the movement to raise visibility in parallel ongoing movements, employed the same hashtags both critically and supportively, and revived and created new hashtags in response to pivotal moments. Notably, tweets authored by black women often expressed emotional support and were critical about differential treatment in the justice system and by police. In comparison, tweets authored by white women and men often highlighted sexual harassment and violence by public figures and weaved in more general political discussions. We discuss the implications of work for digital activism research and design including suggestions to raise visibility by those who were under-represented in this hashtag activism movement.

STUDY DESIGN: Oro-nasopharyngeal swab and saliva samples were collected from all patients simultaneously in the early stage of COVID-19. Viral loads were determined by extracting viral RNAs from saliva samples of patients whose ONP swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR. The demographic information, comorbidities, cycle threshold values, and one-month clinical courses were recorded and compared. RESULTS: The patients' clinical course was evaluated for one month; 56% of patients had mild disease, 26.4% had moderate disease, 9.6% had severe disease, and 8% had a critical/mortal disease. The average cycle threshold values of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva and ONP samples were measured as 22.28 and 24.19, respectively. Cycle threshold value of saliva was found to be significant in predicting disease severity (Eta coefficient 0.979). A statistically significant relationship was found between the disease's severity and the mean of ONP samples' Ct-values (p < 0.05). Gender, age, body mass index, and co-morbidities were compared with the severity of the disease; no statistically significant difference was found. CONCLUSION: Viral load detected in saliva in the early period of COVID-19 infection may have a prognostic value in showing the disease's course in patients over 45-year-old.

Transmission of the infection occurs by inhalation of infected droplets or direct contact with soiled surfaces and fomites. It should be suspected in all symptomatic children who have undertaken international travel in the last 14 d, all hospitalized children with severe acute respiratory illness, and asymptomatic direct and high-risk contacts of a confirmed case. Clinical symptoms are similar to any acute respiratory viral infection with less pronounced nasal symptoms. Disease seems to be milder in children, but situation appears to be changing. Infants and young children had relatively more severe illness than older children. The case fatality rate is low in children. Diagnosis can be confirmed by Reverse transcriptase - Polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on respiratory specimen (commonly nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab). Rapid progress is being made to develop rapid diagnostic tests, which will help ramp up the capacity to test and also reduce the time to getting test results. Management is mainly supportive care. In severe pneumonia and critically ill children, trial of hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir/ritonavir should be considered. As per current policy, children with mild disease also need to be hospitalized; if this is not feasible, these children may be managed on ambulatory basis with strict home isolation. Pneumonia, severe disease and critical illness require admission and aggressive management for acute lung injury and shock and/or multiorgan dysfunction, if present. An early intubation is preferred over non-invasive ventilation or heated, humidified, high flow nasal cannula oxygen, as these may generate aerosols increasing the risk of infection in health care personnel. To prevent post discharge dissemination of infection, home isolation for 1-2 wk may be advised.

SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to elevated markers of cardiac injury associated with higher risk of mortality. It is unclear whether cardiac injury is caused by direct infection of cardiomyocytes or is mainly secondary to lung injury and inflammation. Here, we investigate whether cardiomyocytes are permissive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS AND RESULTS: Two strains of SARS-CoV-2 infected human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPS-CMs) as demonstrated by detection of intracellular double-stranded viral RNA and viral spike glycoprotein expression. Increasing concentrations of viral RNA are detected in supernatants of infected cardiomyocytes, which induced infections in Caco-2 cell lines, documenting productive infections. SARS-COV-2 infection and induced cytotoxic and proapoptotic effects associated with it abolished cardiomyocyte beating. RNA sequencing confirmed a transcriptional response to viral infection as demonstrated by the up-regulation of genes associated with pathways related to viral response and interferon signalling, apoptosis, and reactive oxygen stress. SARS-CoV-2 infection and cardiotoxicity was confirmed in a 3D cardiosphere tissue model. Importantly, viral spike protein and viral particles were detected in living human heart slices after infection with SARS-CoV-2. Coronavirus particles were further observed in cardiomyocytes of a patient with COVID-19. Infection of iPS-CMs was dependent on cathepsins and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and was blocked by remdesivir. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 infects cardiomyocytes in vitro in an ACE2- and cathepsin-dependent manner. SARS-CoV-2 infection of cardiomyocytes is inhibited by the antiviral drug remdesivir. TRANSLATIONAL PERSPECTIVE: Although this study cannot address whether cardiac injury and dysfunction in COVID-19 patients is caused by direct infection of cardiomyocytes, the demonstration of direct cardiotoxicity in cardiomyocytes, organ mimics, human heart slices and human hearts warrants the further monitoring of cardiotoxic effects in COVID-19 patients.","Bojkova, Denisa; Wagner, Julian U G; Shumliakivska, Mariana; Aslan, Galip S; Saleem, Umber; Hansen, Arne; Luxán, Guillermo; Günther, Stefan; Pham, Minh Duc; Krishnan, Jaya; Harter, Patrick N; Ermel, Utz H; Frangakis, Achilleas S; Milting, Hendrik; Zeiher, Andreas M; Klingel, Karin; Cinatl, Jindrich; Dendorfer, Andreas; Eschenhagen, Thomas; Tschöpe, Carsten; Ciesek, Sandra; Dimmeler, Stefanie",Cardiovasc. res,18,16

It is still unclear how fast the virus evolved and how it interacts with other microorganisms in the lung. METHODS: We have conducted metatranscriptome sequencing for bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from 8 patients with SARS-CoV-2, and also analyzed data from 25 patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and 20 healthy controls for comparison. RESULTS: The median number of intrahost variants was 1-4 in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, ranged from 0 to 51 in different samples. The distribution of variants on genes was similar to those observed in the population data. However, very few intrahost variants were observed in the population as polymorphisms, implying either a bottleneck or purifying selection involved in the transmission of the virus, or a consequence of the limited diversity represented in the current polymorphism data. Although current evidence did not support the transmission of intrahost variants in a possible person-to-person spread, the risk should not be overlooked. Microbiotas in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients were similar to those in CAP, either dominated by the pathogens or with elevated levels of oral and upper respiratory commensal bacteria. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 evolves in vivo after infection, which may affect its virulence, infectivity, and transmissibility. Although how the intrahost variant spreads in the population is still elusive, it is necessary to strengthen the surveillance of the viral evolution in the population and associated clinical changes.","Shen, Zijie; Xiao, Yan; Kang, Lu; Ma, Wentai; Shi, Leisheng; Zhang, Li; Zhou, Zhuo; Yang, Jing; Zhong, Jiaxin; Yang, Donghong; Guo, Li; Zhang, Guoliang; Li, Hongru; Xu, Yu; Chen, Mingwei; Gao, Zhancheng; Wang, Jianwei; Ren, Lili; Li, Mingkun",Clin Infect Dis,18,1

The pig is an increasing important animal model for molecular study and pharmaceutical research. However, the transcript variant and temporal expression pattern of EZH2 in the middle and late porcine fetus are still unknown. Here, we identified the coding sequence of the EZH2 gene and characterized its expression pattern in fetal tissues of Duroc pigs at 65- and 90-day postcoitus (dpc). Our results showed that the coding sequence of EZH2 was 2241 bp, encoding 746 amino acids. There were 9 amino acid insertions and an amino acid substitution in this transcript compared with the validated reference sequence in NCBI. EZH2 was ubiquitously expressed in the fetal tissues of two time points with different expression levels. These results validated a different transcript in pigs and characterized its expression profile in fetal tissues of different gestation stages, which indicated that EZH2 played important roles during porcine embryonic development.","Tan, Baohua; Hong, Linjun; Qiao, Jiaxin; Zhou, Jian; Xing, Pingping; Yan, Guanhao; Zheng, Enqin; Cai, Gengyuan; Huang, Sixiu; Wu, Zhenfang; Gu, Ting",Biomed Res Int,18,1

However, it has certain disadvantages which may be overcome by gargling. The primary objective of this study was to assess agreement between gargle lavage and swab as an appropriate respiratory sample for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The secondary objective was to assess the patient acceptability of the two sampling methods. Methods: It was a cross-sectional study done at a tertiary care hospital in New Delhi, India, on 50 confirmed COVID-19 patients. Paired swab (NPS and OPS) and gargle samples were taken within 72 h of their diagnosis. Samples were processed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for detection of SARS-CoV-2. Post-sample collection, a 10-point scale was administered to assess the level of discomfort with either of the collection methods. Results: All gargle samples were positive and comparable to their corresponding swab samples irrespective of the symptoms and duration of illness. The cycle threshold (Ct) values for gargle samples were slightly higher but comparable to those of swabs. Bland-Altman plot showed good agreement between the two methods. Majority (72%) of the patients reported moderate-to-severe discomfort with swab collection in comparison to 24 per cent reporting only mild discomfort with gargle collection. Interpretation & conclusions: Our preliminary results show that the gargle lavage may be a viable alternative to swabs for sample collection for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Adoption of gargle lavage for sample collection will have a significant impact as it will enable easy self-collection, relieve healthcare workers and also lead to substantial cost savings by reducing the need for swabs and personal protective equipment.","Mittal, Ankit; Gupta, Ankesh; Kumar, Shiv; Surjit, Milan; Singh, Binit; Soneja, Manish; Soni, Kapil Dev; Khan, Adil Rashid; Singh, Komal; Naik, Shivdas; Kumar, Arvind; Aggarwal, Richa; Nischal, Neeraj; Sinha, Sanjeev; Trikha, Anjan; Wig, Naveet",Indian J Med Res,18,16

Preliminary reports have, in general, indicated worse outcomes in diabetes mellitus (DM) patients, but the magnitude of cardiovascular (CV) complications in this subgroup has not been elucidated. Methods: We included 142 patients admitted with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from April 1st to May 30th 2020; 71 (50%) had DM. We compared baseline demographics and study outcomes between those with or without DM using descriptive statistics. Multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate the adjusted odds ratio for the study outcomes in DM patients, compared to those without DM, stratified by age, sex and glycaemic control. CV outcomes of interest include acute myocarditis, acute heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, new-onset atrial fibrillation and composite cardiovascular end-point consisting of all individual outcomes above.

Many institutions still use patient-controlled epidural analgesia without a background infusion, and a comparative study between programmed intermittent epidural bolus and patient-controlled epidural analgesia without a background infusion has not yet been performed. We performed a randomised, two-centre, double-blind, controlled trial of these two techniques. The primary outcome was the incidence of breakthrough pain requiring a top-up dose by an anaesthetist. Secondary outcomes included: motor block; pain scores; patient satisfaction; local anaesthetic consumption; and obstetric and neonatal outcomes. We recruited 130 nulliparous women who received initial spinal analgesia, and then epidural analgesia was initiated and maintained with either programmed intermittent epidural bolus or patient-controlled epidural analgesia using ropivacaine 0.12% with sufentanil 0.75 µg·ml-1 . The programmed intermittent epidural bolus group had a programmed bolus of 10 ml every hour, with on-demand patient-controlled epidural analgesia boluses of 5 ml with a 20 min lockout, and the patient-controlled epidural analgesia group had a 5 ml bolus with a 12 min lockout interval; the potential maximum volume per hour was the same in both groups. The patients in the programmed intermittent epidural bolus group had less frequent breakthrough pain compared with the patient-controlled epidural analgesia group, 7 (10.9%) vs. 38 (62.3%; p < 0.0001), respectively. There was a significant difference in motor block (modified Bromage score &#8804; 4) frequency between groups, programmed intermittent epidural bolus group 1 (1.6%) vs. patient-controlled epidural analgesia group 8 (13.1%); p = 0.015. The programmed intermittent epidural bolus group had greater local anaesthetic consumption with fewer patient-controlled epidural analgesia boluses. Patient satisfaction scores and obstetric or neonatal outcomes were not different between groups. In conclusion, we found that a programmed intermittent epidural bolus technique using 10 ml programmed boluses and 5 ml patient-controlled epidural analgesia boluses was superior to a patient-controlled epidural analgesia technique using 5 ml boluses and no background infusion.","Roofthooft, E; Barbé, A; Schildermans, J; Cromheecke, S; Devroe, S; Fieuws, S; Rex, S; Wong, C A; Van de Velde, M",Anaesthesia (Lond.),18,16

However, when the virus enters the body it also interacts with the micro-organisms already inhabiting the host. Understanding the virus-host-microbiome interactions can yield additional insights into the biological processes perturbed by viral invasion. Alterations in the gut microbiome species and metabolites have been noted during respiratory viral infections, possibly impacting the lungs via gut-lung microbiome crosstalk. To better characterize microbial functions in the lower respiratory tract during COVID-19 infection, we carry out a functional analysis of previously published metatranscriptome sequencing data of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from eight COVID-19 cases, twenty-five community-acquired pneumonia patients, and twenty healthy controls. The functional profiles resulting from comparing the sequences against annotated microbial protein domains clearly separate the cohorts. By examining the associated metabolic pathways, distinguishing functional signatures in COVID-19 respiratory tract microbiomes are identified, including decreased potential for lipid metabolism and glycan biosynthesis and metabolism pathways, and increased potential for carbohydrate metabolism pathways. The results include overlap between previous studies on COVID-19 microbiomes, including decrease in the glycosaminoglycan degradation pathway and increase in carbohydrate metabolism. The results also suggest novel connections to consider, possibly specific to the lower respiratory tract microbiome, calling for further research on microbial functions and host-microbiome interactions during SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Haiminen, Niina; Utro, Filippo; Seabolt, Ed; Parida, Laxmi",Sci Rep,18,6

Respondents also agreed or disagreed with their beliefs about food safety, cooking skills, family support, home characterization, feelings and behaviors. All factors of influence on the IDQ or WDQ groups were always compared against the general participants (who did not change their diet sufficiently to be classified into these groups). Individuals from the IDQ group spent more time on food (81.4% versus 62.0%), started to cook more often (91.4%), were more confident with their cooking skills (p < 0.01) and positive feelings were at least 2.5 times more prevalent. Adjusted analysis showed the chance to improve diet was 1.39 higher among those who did not feel overworked and increased 1.07 in each additional cooking chore shared between household members. For each additional positive feeling, the odds were 1.41 to IDQ and 0.67 to WDQ. Moreover, for each additional negative feeling the chances for WDQ were 1.21 and 0.90 for IDQ. Those in the WDQ group were more unaware of issues related to contagion during meals, they were not afraid of eating food prepared outside their home and agreed that industrialized food is safer (OR = 1.85).

Weather components recently came to notice as the northern hemisphere was hit by escalated incidence in winter. This study investigated the association between COVID-19 cases and two components, average temperature and relative humidity, in the 16 states of Germany. Three main approaches were carried out in this study, namely temporal correlation, spatial auto-correlation, and clustering-integrated panel regression. It is claimed that the daily COVID-19 cases correlate negatively with the average temperature and positively with the average relative humidity. To extract the spatial auto-correlation, both global Moran's [Formula: see text] and global Geary's [Formula: see text] were used whereby no significant difference in the results was observed. It is evident that randomness overwhelms the spatial pattern in all the states for most of the observations, except in recent observations where either local clusters or dispersion occurred. This is further supported by Moran's scatter plot, where states' dynamics to and fro cold and hot spots are identified, rendering a traveling-related early warning system. A random-effects model was used in the sense of case-weather regression including incidence clustering. Our task is to perceive which ranges of the incidence that are well predicted by the existing weather components rather than seeing which ranges of the weather components predicting the incidence.

This review summarizes the available data on HPA axis impairment in GC-treated SARS-CoV-2 patients, focusing on the risk of adrenal insufficiency and on potential drug interactions during concomitant treatments. METHODS: Literature on the impact of GCs therapy on HPA axis and on the consequences of coadministration of GCs and other drugs in SARS-CoV-2 patients has been reviewed. RESULTS: GC treatment can cause symptoms of hypercortisolism, especially in patients with individual hypersensibility, or hypoadrenalism after drug withdrawal, due to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, with consequences in terms of increased morbidity and mortality risk. On the other hand, in SARS-CoV-2-infected patient's cortisol secretion could be insufficient also due to critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency (CIRCI). In addition, in this clinical context, the co-administration of antiretroviral drugs and corticosteroids may trigger drug-drug interaction and enhance the exposure to the latter ones, metabolized through the CYP450 CYP3A pathway, severely impacting on HPA axis. CONCLUSION: Physicians involved in the management of patients affected by COVID-19 should be aware of the need of an appropriate GC dose tapering, and of potential interaction of GCs with antiviral therapy and drugs used to treat associated co-morbidities.","Ferraù, F; Ceccato, F; Cannavò, S; Scaroni, C",J. endocrinol. invest,18,12

The red guava (Psidium guajava L.) fruit contains antioxidants derived from quercetin, lycopene, and vitamin C. This study aimed to determine the effect of red guava fruit extract (RGFE) on the alveolar tissue of rats exposed to cigarette smoke. The 25 rats (Rattus norvegicus) were divided into five groups. The control and T0 groups were only administered placebo, while T1, T2, and T3 groups were orally administered RGFE of 18.9, 37.8, and 56.7 mg/kg body weight daily for 44 days. The CSE dose of 20 suctions daily was conducted on T0, T1, T2, and T3 groups on days 15–44. On day 45, all rats were sacrificed for serum collection and histopathological lung slides with eosin-nigrosin staining. The result showed that CSE caused an increase p&lt;0.05 in malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, cell death, apoptosis, and necrosis percentages, congestion and thickening of alveolar septum tissue, and reduction in the alveolar diameter and alveolar number. Administration of RGFE suppressed those effects, and the highest dose of RGFE (T3) restored p&gt;0.05 MDA levels, percentage of apoptotic and necrosis, alveolar septal thickening, and alveolar diameter. However, the percentages of cell death, alveolar congestion, and the alveolar number were still worse p&lt;0.05 than in normal rats. It could be concluded that RGFE has proved relief and restoration of the alveolar tissue of rats exposed to cigarette smoke.","Meles, Dewa Ketut Imam Mustofa Wurlina Wurlina Susilowati Suherni Utama Suzanita Suwasanti Niluh Desak Ketut Sekar Cempaka Putri",Veterinary Medicine International,18,16

Protecting those at high risk of infection/transmission, whilst addressing the multiple health and social needs of this group, is of utmost importance. The aim of this novel qualitative study was to document how one service in Scotland, the Wellbeing Centre run by The Salvation Army, adapted in response. METHODS: Care was taken to identify methods that did not create additional stress at this pressured time. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with Centre clients (n = 10, in-person and telephone) and staff (n = 5, telephone), and external professionals (n = 5, telephone), during April-August 2020. These were audio-recorded, fully transcribed, and analysed using Framework. Service documents were used to enhance contextual understanding. Analysis was informed by theories of psychologically informed environments and enabling environments. RESULTS: The start of the pandemic was a time of confusion, disruption, and isolation. Centre staff rapidly adapted methods of engagement to provide a range of comprehensive physical and emotional supports, to both existing and new clients, through telephone and online communication and, eventually, socially distanced in-person support. This involved balancing the risks of COVID-19 infection/transmission with the benefits of continuity of support to those highly vulnerable to a range of harms. Whilst the pandemic created many challenges, it also facilitated removal of barriers, particularly concerning provision of harm reduction services which had previously been severely constrained. Clients described the Centre as a 'lifeline', providing stability and safety during a period of profound disruption when other services closed their doors. Strong leadership, intensive team working, support/training for staff, a focus on relationships, and active use of client feedback, enabled responsive adaptation to fast-changing demands and the creation of a 'culture of care'. CONCLUSION: This study provides a unique insight into the pandemic by analysing the response of one homeless service during the height of the pandemic. We present a range of implications that have international relevance for those designing policies, and adapting front-line services, to proactively respond to COVID-19 and the continued public health crises of homelessness and drug-related deaths.","Parkes, Tessa; Carver, Hannah; Masterton, Wendy; Falzon, Danilo; Dumbrell, Josh; Grant, Susan; Wilson, Iain",Harm Reduct J,18,22

Remote examination of patients with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) brings particular challenges, given the propensity of HS to affect intimate body areas. To understand the impact of remote consultations on the care of patients with HS, a retrospective analysis was conducted of all consultations from 2 April to 29 October 2020 at the HS clinic at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust. In this group of patients with HS, 46.3% were black, compared with 7.0% of patients attending general dermatology clinics (P < 0.001). The majority (65.9%) of patients had previously received or were currently taking adalimumab. All consultations were performed by telephone and in 50.7% of the consultations, patients were assessed as having unstable (u)HS, with 81.1% of these uHS episodes leading to a change in pharmacological therapy. The decision-making process was aided by patient-submitted photographs at only 8.1% of consultations involving uHS, for reasons of patient privacy, comfort and data security.

Due to the economic impacts of social distancing, there is growing desire to relax these measures. To characterize a range of possible strategies for control and to understand their consequences, we performed an optimal control analysis of a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Given that the pandemic is already underway and controls have already been initiated, we calibrated our model to data from the USA and focused our analysis on optimal controls from May 2020 through December 2021. We found that a major factor that differentiates strategies that prioritize lives saved versus reduced time under control is how quickly control is relaxed once social distancing restrictions expire in May 2020. Strategies that maintain control at a high level until at least summer 2020 allow for tapering of control thereafter and minimal deaths, whereas strategies that relax control in the short term lead to fewer options for control later and a higher likelihood of exceeding hospital capacity. Our results also highlight that the potential scope for controlling COVID-19 until a vaccine is available depends on epidemiological parameters about which there is still considerable uncertainty, including the basic reproduction number and the effectiveness of social distancing. In light of those uncertainties, our results do not constitute a quantitative forecast and instead provide a qualitative portrayal of possible outcomes from alternative approaches to control.","Perkins, T Alex; España, Guido",Bull Math Biol,18,20

Paired t-tests suggested that social distancing and self-quarantine behaviors decreased while precautionary behaviors increased from w1 to w2. Path analysis indicated that two HBM constructs (perceived barriers and self-efficacy) mediated the association between COVID-19 stressors and precautionary behaviors. These findings suggested that tailored prevention intervention for college students should attend to perceived barriers and self-efficacy. Individuals who exposed to multiple pandemic stressors merit particular attention and intervention should account for their early pandemic stress experiences.","Tam, Cheuk Chi; Li, Xiaoyan; Li, Xiaoming; Wang, Yuyan; Lin, Danhua",Curr Psychol,18,1

Recent scientific evidences have suggested that the main protease (Mpro) enzyme in SARS-CoV-2 can be an ideal drug target due to its crucial role in the viral replication and transcription processes. Therefore, there are ongoing research efforts to identify drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro that resulted in hundreds of X-ray crystal structures of ligand-bound Mpro complexes in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) describing the interactions of different fragment chemotypes within different sites of the Mpro. In this work, we performed rigorous molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of 62 reversible ligand-Mpro complexes in the PDB to gain mechanistic insights about their interactions at the atomic level. Using a total of over 3 µs long MD trajectories, we characterized different pockets in the apo Mpro structure, and analyzed the dynamic interactions and binding affinity of ligands within those pockets. Our results identified the key residues that stabilize the ligands in the catalytic sites and other pockets of Mpro. Our analyses unraveled the role of a lateral pocket in the catalytic site in Mpro that is critical for enhancing the ligand binding to the enzyme. We also highlighted the important contribution from HIS163 in the lateral pocket towards ligand binding and affinity against Mpro through computational mutation analyses. Further, we revealed the effects of explicit water molecules and Mpro dimerization in the ligand association with the target. Thus, comprehensive molecular-level insights gained from this work can be useful to identify or design potent small molecule inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.","Weng, Ying Li; Naik, Shiv Rakesh; Dingelstad, Nadia; Lugo, Miguel R; Kalyaanamoorthy, Subha; Ganesan, Aravindhan",Sci Rep,18,16

METHODS: We gathered the data of COVID-19 pneumonia participants from our electronic medical system, including daily medical knowledge and laboratory, radiological, and microbiological results between March 10 to April 7, 2020. RESULTS: Totally, 125 patients, whose findings were compatible with COVID-19, were included in the study, 42 patients were excluded from the study. The distribution of genders was, 39 females (46.9 %), 44 males (53.01 %), the average age was 56.36 ± 16.25 (19-85). Hypertension above 60 years of age and diabetes mellitus under 60 years of age were the most common comorbidities. Neutrophils/ Lymphocyte percent(% NLR) was noted in 44 (53.01 %) patients, average: 3 (range 1.78-4.63). There was a statistically significant and positive relationship between D-dimer and C Reactive Protein (CRP) and ferritin. CONCLUSION: We detected that comorbidities, which were seen at COVID-19 disease differ according to the patients age.

Much remains unknown about host cells and tissues affected by coronavirus infections, including the hematopoietic system. Here, we discuss the recent findings examining effects that coronavirus infection or exposure has on hematopoietic cells and the clinical implications for these effects. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have centered on SARS-CoV-2, demonstrating that hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and mature immune cells may be susceptible to infection and are impacted functionally by exposure to SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. These findings have important implications regarding hematologic complications arising from COVID-19 and other coronavirus-induced disease, which we discuss here. SUMMARY: Infection with coronaviruses sometimes leads to hematologic complications in patients, and these hematologic complications are associated with poorer prognosis. These hematologic complications may be caused by coronavirus direct infection or impact on primitive hematopoietic cells or mature immune cells, by indirect effects on these cells, or by a combination thereof. It is important to understand how hematologic complications arise in order to seek new treatments to improve patient outcomes.","Ropa, James; Trinh, Thao; Aljoufi, Arafat; Broxmeyer, Hal E",Curr. opin. hematol,18,1

METHODS: The study included 55 children infected with COVID-19 and 60 healthy children for the comparison of leukocyte and thrombocyte count, MPV, and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Demographic data and clinical findings of all the cases were recorded, including age, gender, weight, temperature, cough, shortness of breath and contact history. RESULTS: The MPV values were determined to be statistically significantly high (p<0.001) and the lymphocyte values were significantly low (p:0.002) in the asymptomatic children infected with COVID-19 compared to the healthy control children. No difference was determined between the groups in respect of CRP level, leukocyte and thrombocyte counts (p>0.05). The optimal cutoff point for MPV was determined as 8.74 fl (Area under the curve-AUC:0.932) with 81.82% sensitivity and 95% specificity for the determination of children infected with COVID-19. A cutoff value of <2.12/mm3 for lymphocytes (AUC:0.670) was determined with 49.09% sensitivity and 86.67% specificity for the prediction of COVID-19. Based on the ROC analysis, the sensitivity and specificity of MPV was determined to be higher than that of lymphocyte levels. CONCLUSION: The results of this study that MPV levels are significantly high in asymptomatic children infected with COVID-19 demonstrate that this is an important predictive value and has better predictive capacity than lymphocyte values. The evaluation of MPV and lymphocyte levels together could increase diagnostic success in asymptomatic COVID-19 cases.","Gumus, Huseyin; Demir, Abit; Yukkaldiran, Ahmet",Int J Clin Pract,18,10

Metformin which prescribed as the first-line treatment of type 2 diabetes has beneficial effects on Sars-cov2 infection. These effects are including regulation of immune system, Renin-Angiotensin System and Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4 function in Covid-19 infection. It also activates ACE2, the main receptor of Sars-cov2, in the epithelial cells of respiratory tissue through AMPK signaling and subsequently decreases the rate of viral adhesion. Metformin also declines the adherence of Sars-cov2 to DPP4 (the other receptor of the virus) on T cells. Hence, regulatory effects of metformin on membranous ACE2, and DPP4 can modulate immune reaction against Sars-cov2. Also, immunometabolic effects of metformin on inflammatory cells impair hyper-reactive immune response against the virus through reduction of glycolysis and propagation of mitochondrial oxidation. Metformin also decreases platelet aggravation and risk of thrombosis. In this article, we argue that metformin has beneficial effects on Covid-19 infection in patients with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance. This opinion should be investigated in future clinical trials.","Hashemi, Payam; Pezeshki, Shaghayegh",Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol,18,16

Although synthetic vascular grafts have been successfully commercialized for clinical use, they are currently only readily available for large-diameter vessels (>6 mm). Small-diameter vessel (<6 mm) replacements, however, still present significant clinical challenges worldwide. The primary objective of this study is to create novel, tunable, small-diameter blood vessels with biomimetic two distinct cell layers [vascular endothelial cell (VEC) and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC)] using an advanced coaxial 3D-bioplotter platform. Specifically, the VSMCs were laden in the vessel wall and VECs grew in the lumen to mimic the natural composition of the blood vessel. First, a novel bioink consisting of VSMCs laden in gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA)/polyethylene(glycol)diacrylate/alginate and lyase was designed. This specific design is favorable for nutrient exchange in an ambient environment and simultaneously improves laden cell proliferation in the matrix pore without the space restriction inherent with substance encapsulation. In the vessel wall, the laden VSMCs steadily grew as the alginate was gradually degraded by lyase leaving more space for cell proliferation in matrices. Through computational fluid dynamics simulation, the vessel demonstrated significantly perfusable and mechanical properties under various flow velocities, flow viscosities, and temperature conditions. Moreover, both VSMCs in the scaffold matrix and VECs in the lumen steadily proliferated over time creating a significant two-cell-layered structure. Cell proliferation was confirmed visually through staining the markers of alpha-smooth muscle actin and cluster of differentiation 31, commonly tied to angiogenesis phenomena, in the vessel matrices and lumen, respectively. Furthermore, the results were confirmed quantitatively through gene analysis which suggested good angiogenesis expression in the blood vessels. This study demonstrated that the printed blood vessels with two distinct cell layers of VECs and VSMCs could be potential candidates for clinical small-diameter blood vessel replacement applications.","Zhou, Xuan; Nowicki, Margaret; Sun, Hao; Hann, Sung Yun; Cui, Haitao; Esworthy, Timothy; Lee, James D; Plesniak, Michael; Zhang, Lijie Grace",ACS Appl Mater Interfaces,18,6

Still, the goals are consistent: to improve patient experience, lower costs, reduce risk, and provide insights into a wide range of care and management issues. Most health systems face similar challenges, such as margin enhancement, quality improvement, increased access, and fending off disruptive competition. Systemness is a way to address these challenges while improving the overall interdependence of the organization. Although embraced by and advantageous to healthcare organizations, systemness efforts often fail. The obstacles are surmountable when organizations thoroughly analyze the achievable scale of systemness, community resources, and current mindset regarding the good of the whole. Leaders must play a vital role in promoting systemness by providing education and a routine review of day-to-day organizational activities. Sometimes, systemness requires a change in leadership or an updating of leadership skills.Organizations must recognize and assess their culture as it relates to principles of independence versus interdependence, and refocus clinical standardization through best-practice protocols and policies as COVID-19 affects the already-fractured healthcare sector. Fortunately, current and developing artificial intelligence, wearables, at-home testing, and improved technologies promise to provide a needed break for a contracting physician field and fatigued front line, and they present an opportunity for those organizations poised to meet the systemness challenge.","Stokes, Charles D; Brace, Rod",Front Health Serv Manage,18,0

Neonatal patients needing intensive care are considered a vulnerable population. To report the results of a policy based on multi-timepoint surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 of all neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), their parents, and all healthcare providers in a part of Italy with a high prevalence of the infection. Observational study conducted from 21 February to 21 April 2020. Intervention consisted of (a) parental triage on arrival at the neonatal ward; (b) universal testing with nasopharyngeal swabs and blood testing for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies; (c) use of continuous personal protective equipment at the NICU by parents and staff. A total of 6726 triage procedures were performed on 114 parents, and 954 nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from 226 individuals. Five (2.2%) asymptomatic individuals (2 parents and 3 healthcare providers) tested positive on nasopharyngeal swabs and were kept isolated for 14 days. Of 75 admitted newborn, no one tested positive on nasopharyngeal swabs or antibody tests. Three parents presented with fever or flu-like symptoms at triage; they tested negative on swabs.Conclusion: With universal screening of neonates, parents, and staff, there were no cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection among the neonates admitted to a NICU in an area with a high incidence of SARS-CoV-2. Our experience could be usefully compared with other strategies with a view to developing future evidence-based guidelines for managing high-risk neonates in case of new epidemics.

In the modified SEIR dynamics, individuals reduce their number of contacts as a function of the weighted sum of cumulative number of cases within the locality and in neighboring localities. We consider a scenario with two localities where disease originates in one locality and is exported to the neighboring locality via travel of exposed (latently infected) individuals. We establish a lower bound on the outbreak size at the origin as a function of the speed of spread. Using the lower bound on the outbreak size at the origin, we establish an upper bound on the outbreak size at the importing locality as a function of the speed of spread and the level of preparedness for the low mobility regime. We evaluate the critical levels of preparedness that stop the disease from spreading at the importing locality. Finally, we show how the benefit of preparedness diminishes under high mobility rates.

With more COVID-19 vaccines expecting approval in the coming months, it is necessary to note that vaccine availability does not equate to vaccine accessibility, nor vaccine efficacy. Some research suggests that approximately 9 out of 10 individuals living in lower-income countries will not have access to COVID-19 vaccines until 2023 or later. For higher-income countries, such as the United States, the prevalence of vaccine hesitancy may further compound the situation.

Furthermore, this paper argues for the continued imperative for health experts and government officials to communicate and emphasize the importance of COVID-19 safety measures with the public, to make sure people are protected against COVID-19 till the pandemic ceases to pose a threat to personal or public health.","Su, Zhaohui; Wen, Jun; McDonnell, Dean; Goh, Edmund; Li, Xiaoshan; Segalo, Sabina; Ahmad, Junaid; Cheshmehzangi, Ali; Xiang, Yu-Tao",Brain Behav Immun Health,18,20

This study aimed to unravel the possible involvement of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) regulating PHLPP2 in colon cancer. Expressions of candidate lncRNAs and miRNAs were verified by the RT-qPCR and Western blot analyses in colon cancer. The roles of candidate genes in colon cancer were investigated in HT-29 cells in vitro and in mouse tumor xenograft model in vivo. PHLPP2, a target of miR-141 and miR-424, was downregulated in colon cancer. PHLPP2 upregulation and miR-141 and miR-424 downregulation suppressed the colon cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and promote cell apoptosis, which also resulted in suppression of tumor metastasis and formation. Furthermore, LINC00402, LINC00461, and SFTA1P were identified as the targets of miR-141 and miR-424 and acted as competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) of PHLPP2. The upregulation of LINC00402, LINC00461, and SFTA1P was verified to enhance the suppressive effects of PHLPP2 in the pathogenesis of colon cancer. Conjointly, our results demonstrated the suppressive effects of PHLPP2 in colon cancer and proved that LINC00402, LINC00461, and SFTA1P acted as ceRNAs of PHLPP2 by competitive binding to miR-141 and miR-424.","Wu, Hong-Kun; Liu, Chang; Li, Xin-Xing; Ji, Wei; Xin, Chen-De; Hu, Zhi-Qian; Zhou, Lin","Aging (Albany, N.Y.

We used international patient survey data to explore the hypothesis that greater risk-mitigating behaviour in those receiving targeted therapies may account, at least in part, for this observation. METHODS: Online surveys were completed by individuals with psoriasis (globally) or Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal Diseases (RMD) (UK only) between 4th May and 7th September 2020. We used multiple logistic regression to assess the association between treatment type and risk-mitigating behaviour, adjusting for clinical and demographic characteristics. We characterised international variation in a mixed effects model. RESULTS: Of 3,720 participants (2,869 psoriasis, 851 RMD) from 74 countries, 2,262 (60.8%) reported the most stringent risk-mitigating behaviour (classified here under the umbrella term 'shielding'). A greater proportion of those receiving targeted therapies (biologics and JAK inhibitors) reported shielding compared to those receiving no systemic therapy (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.63, 95% CI 1.35-1.97) and standard systemic agents (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.22-1.56). Shielding was associated with established risk factors for severe COVID-19 (male sex [OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.05-1.24], obesity [OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.23-1.54], comorbidity burden [OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.15-1.78]), a primary indication of RMD (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.27-1.48) and a positive anxiety or depression screen (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.36-1.80). Modest differences in the proportion shielding were observed across nations. CONCLUSIONS: Greater risk-mitigating behaviour among people with IMIDs receiving targeted therapies may contribute to the reported lower risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes. The behaviour variation across treatment groups, IMIDs and nations reinforces the need for clear evidence-based patient communication on risk mitigation strategies and may help inform updated public health guidelines as the pandemic continues.","Mahil, S K; Yates, M; Langan, S M; Yiu, Z Z N; Tsakok, T; Dand, N; Mason, K J; McAteer, H; Meynell, F; Coker, B; Vincent, A; Urmston, D; Vesty, A; Kelly, J; Lancelot, C; Moorhead, L; Bachelez, H; Bruce, I N; Capon, F; Contreras, C R; Cope, A P; De La Cruz, C; Di Meglio, P; Gisondi, P; Hyrich, K; Jullien, D; Lambert, J; Marzo-Ortega, H; McInnes, I; Naldi, L; Norton, S; Puig, L; Sengupta, R; Spuls, P; Torres, T; Warren, R B; Waweru, H; Weinman, J; Griffiths, C M; Barker, J N; Brown, M A; Galloway, J B; Smith, C H",Br. j. dermatol,18,13

Recent Findings: Globally, the healthcare system is facing an unprecedented crisis of resources due to the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Fever, cough, dyspnea, myalgia, fatigue, and pneumonia are the most common symptoms associated with it. The incidence of invasive mechanical ventilation in ICU patients ranges from 29.1 to 89.9%. Supplemental oxygen therapy is the main stay treatment for managing hypoxemic respiratory failure. The high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is a novel non-invasive strategy for better oxygenation and ventilation in critically ill patients. In this grim scenario, a reduction in mechanical ventilation by means of HFNC is of prime interest. Summary: HFNC is considered an aerosol-generating intervention with the risk of viral aerosolization with a concern of potential nosocomial transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, there is no consensus regarding the use of HFNC in novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NCIP). HFNC seems to be an effective and safe treatment modality in acute respiratory failure with optimal settings and selection of ideal patients.","Singh, Abhishek; Khanna, Puneet; Sarkar, Soumya",Curr Anesthesiol Rep,18,25

Mefloquine, a human anti-malarial agent, has been shown to inhibit FIPV in vitro. As a first step to evaluate its efficacy and safety profile as a potential FIP treatment for cats, mefloquine underwent incubation in feline, canine and common brush-tailed possum microsomes and phase I metabolism cofactors to determine its rate of phase I depletion. Tramadol was used as a phase I positive control as it undergoes this reaction in both dogs and cats. Using the substrate depletion method, the in vitro intrinsic clearance (mean ± S.D.) of mefloquine by pooled feline and common brush-tailed possum microsomes was 4.5 ± 0.35 and 18.25 ± 3.18 µL/min/mg protein, respectively. However, phase I intrinsic clearance was too slow to determine with canine microsomes. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) identified carboxymefloquine in samples generated by feline microsomes as well as negative controls, suggesting some mefloquine instability. Mefloquine also underwent incubation with feline, canine and common brush-tailed possum microsomes and phase II glucuronidative metabolism cofactors. O-desmethyltramadol (ODMT or M1) was used as a positive control as it undergoes a phase II glucuronidation reaction in these species. The rates of phase II mefloquine depletion by microsomes by all three species were too slow to estimate. Therefore mefloquine likely undergoes phase I hepatic metabolism catalysed by feline and common brush-tailed possum microsomes but not phase II glucuronidative metabolism in all three species and mefloquine is not likely to have delayed elimination in cats with clinically normal, hepatic function.","Izes, Aaron Michael; Kimble, Benjamin; Norris, Jacqueline Marie; Govendir, Merran",PLoS One,18,0

In addition to the community outbreak, secondary and tertiary transmission led to outbreaks at a longterm care facility 100 miles away and at a correctional facility approximately 200 miles away. Overall, 177 COVID-19 cases were epidemiologically linked to the event, including seven hospitalisations and seven deaths (four in hospitalised persons). Investigation revealed noncompliance with CDC's recommended mitigation measures. To reduce transmission, persons should avoid large gatherings, practice physical distancing, wear masks, stay home when ill, and self-quarantine after exposure to a person with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Persons can work with local health officials to increase COVID-19 awareness and determine the best policies for organizing social events to prevent outbreaks in their communities.

We aimed to explore the role of hydroxychloroquine therapy in mildly symptomatic patients diagnosed in the outpatient setting. METHODS: We examined the association between outpatient hydroxychloroquine exposure and the subsequent progression of disease among mildly symptomatic non-hospitalized patients with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection. The primary outcome assessed was requirement of hospitalization. Data was obtained from a retrospective review of electronic health records within a New Jersey USA multi-hospital network. We compared outcomes in patients who received hydroxychloroquine with those who did not applying a multivariable logistic model with propensity matching. RESULTS: Among 1274 outpatients with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection 7.6% were prescribed hydroxychloroquine. In a 1067 patient propensity matched cohort, 21.6% with outpatient exposure to hydroxychloroquine were hospitalized, and 31.4% without exposure were hospitalized. In the primary multivariable logistic regression analysis with propensity matching there was an association between exposure to hydroxychloroquine and a decreased rate of hospitalization from COVID-19 (OR 0.53; 95% CI, 0.29, 0.95).

If engaging in problem-focused coping, for example, they may seek information useful for eliminating the root cause of the threat. However, during crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, people tend to navigate complex information environments marked by high levels of uncertainty. In such contexts, individuals may adopt maladaptive behaviours-for instance, avoiding information or switching to pseudo-epistemic coping-in which they engage with non-scientific explanations. As a consequence, they may learn less from their information environment and become susceptible to conspiracy theories. Against that background, we investigated how threat perceptions relate to learning, believing in conspiracy claims and conspiracy thinking in context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Drawing from two-wave panel data, we found that threat perceptions negatively related to learning and positively related to believing conspiracy claims. Taken together, our findings indicate that high levels of threat perceptions in uncertain information environments may impede societal learning and encourage conspiracy beliefs. Thus, although provoking general anxiety may support short-term political goals, including adherence to policy during crises, accumulated threat perceptions may adversely affect citizens motivation to cooperate in the long term.","Heiss, Raffael; Gell, Sascha; Röthlingshofer, Esther; Zoller, Claudia",Pers Individ Dif,18,1

METHODS: Data were from the US Third National Health and Nutrition Survey for white and black American women and men aged 20 to 50 years. Statistical analysis involved mainly correlation coefficients, the multiple regression of BM, WC, or FVC on SH and leg length (LL), and fitting of allometric regression equations relating each of BM, WC, and FVC to SH or Ht. RESULTS: BM and WC correlated more strongly with SH than with Ht, and FVC correlated more strongly with Ht. Associations with LL were negative for WC, negative or nonsignificant for BM, and positive for FVC. Using round-number exponents for Ht and SH, the allometric relationships indicated that appropriate indices are BM/SH3 , WC/SH, and FVC/Ht2 . CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to usual practice, BM and WC are better scaled in relation to SH than to Ht. FVC is slightly better scaled in relation to Ht, as is conventional. Interpretations involve the small influence of LL on BM and the influence both of gluteo-femoral fatness on measured SH and of childhood health and nutrition on adult LL, WC, and FVC. It is evident that SH should be measured more often for research purposes.","Burton, Richard Francis; Burton, Francis Lindley",Am J Hum Biol,18,16

This systematic review aims to examine the methodologies used in recent research and evaluate the effectiveness of MLD for those at-risk of or living with lymphedema. METHODS: The electronic databases Embase, PubMed, CINAHL Complete and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched using relevant terms. Studies comparing MLD with another intervention or control in patients at-risk of or with lymphedema were included. Studies were critically appraised with the PEDro scale. RESULTS: Seventeen studies with a total of 867 female and two male participants were included. Only studies examining breast cancer-related lymphedema were identified. Some studies reported positive effects of MLD on volume reduction, quality of life and symptom-related outcomes compared with other treatments, while other studies reported no additional benefit of MLD as a component of complex decongestive therapy. In patients at-risk, MLD was reported to reduce incidence of lymphedema in some studies, while others reported no such benefits. CONCLUSIONS: The reviewed articles reported conflicting findings and were often limited by methodological issues. This review highlights the need for further experimental studies on the effectiveness of MLD in lymphedema. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: There is some evidence that MLD in early stages following breast cancer surgery may help prevent progression to clinical lymphedema. MLD may also provide additional benefits in volume reduction for mild lymphedema. However, in moderate to severe lymphedema, MLD may not provide additional benefit when combined with complex decongestive therapy.","Thompson, Belinda; Gaitatzis, Katrina; Janse de Jonge, Xanne; Blackwell, Robbie; Koelmeyer, Louise A",,18,16

Interestingly, our results show a significant variation of the relevant immune subset composition among CP donors. Regarding innate immunity, both non-classical monocytes, and CD11b- granulocytes had fully recovered at eight months post COVID-19 infection. Intermediate monocytes and natural killer (NK) cells had already been restored at the two-month evaluation and remained stable. Regarding adaptive immunity, the COVID-19-related skewed Th1 and Th2 cell polarization remained at the same levels as in two months. However, low levels of total B cells were detected even after eight months from infection. A persisting reduction of CD8+ Tregs and changes in the NKT cell compartment were also remarkable.

RANDOMISATION: Patients are randomized (1:1 ratio) to each group using minimization implemented with the Electric data capture system (DATATRAK Enterprise Cloud), with balancing of the arms with age range (under 50 years of age or not) and having a history of risk factors for COVID-19 (cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, respiratory diseases). BLINDING (MASKING): Only participants will be randomized. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The main research hypothesis of this study is that Kampo medicines significantly prevent the onset of COVID-19. It is assumed that the infection rate before the administration of the drug under consideration will be 0% and that the incidence of COVID-19 thereafter will be 2- 3%, of which 70%-80% will show symptoms of COVID-19. Assuming that the pharmaceutical effect of the drug will be effective in 50% of patients and that the incidence rates in the placebo and drug groups will be 1.4%-2.4% and 0.7%-1.2%, respectively, the placebo is calculated at 2%, and the study drug at 1%. Since the frequency of verification is low and the number of cases will be large, we set a total of 10 analyses (9 interim analyses and a final analysis). Since the number of cases at the time of the final analysis will be 4,986 under the conditions of α = 0.05 and a power of 80% by the Peto method. We set at 600 cases in each interim analysis with an estimated dropout rate of 16.9%. Finally, the total number of cases is set to 6,000 with 3,000 in the placebo group and 3,000 in the HET group.

Caveolin-1 is the most important structural protein of caveolae, a membrane invagination widely known for its role in endocytosis and subsequent cytoplasmic transportation. Caveolae/caveolin-1 is tightly associated with a wide range of biological processes, including cholesterol homeostasis, cell mechano-sensing, tumorigenesis, and signal transduction. Intriguingly, the versatile roles of caveolae/caveolin-1 in virus infections have increasingly been appreciated. Over the past few decades, more and more viruses have been identified to invade host cells via caveolae-mediated endocytosis, although other known pathways have been explored. The subsequent post-entry events, including trafficking, replication, assembly, and egress of a large number of viruses, are caveolae/caveolin-1-dependent. Deprivation of caveolae/caveolin-1 by drug application or gene editing leads to abnormalities in viral uptake, viral protein expression, or virion release, whereas the underlying mechanisms remain elusive and must be explored holistically to provide potential novel antiviral targets and strategies. This review recapitulates our current knowledge on how caveolae/caveolin-1 functions in every step of the viral infection cycle and various relevant signaling pathways, hoping to provide a new perspective for future viral cell biology research.","Xing, Yifan; Wen, Zeyu; Gao, Wei; Lin, Zhekai; Zhong, Jin; Jiu, Yaming",Viruses,18,20

Antibody responses are a central component of naturally acquired malaria immunity. PfEMP1-specific IgG likely protects by inhibiting IE sequestration and through IgG-Fc Receptor (FcγR) mediated phagocytosis and killing of antibody-opsonized IEs. The affinity of afucosylated IgG to FcγRIIIa is up to 40-fold higher than fucosylated IgG, resulting in enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Most IgG in plasma is fully fucosylated, but afucosylated IgG is elicited in response to enveloped viruses and to paternal alloantigens during pregnancy. Here we show that naturally acquired PfEMP1-specific IgG is strongly afucosylated in a stable and exposure-dependent manner, and efficiently induces FcγRIIIa-dependent natural killer (NK) cell degranulation. In contrast, immunization with a subunit PfEMP1 (VAR2CSA) vaccine results in fully fucosylated specific IgG. These results have implications for understanding protective natural- and vaccine-induced immunity to malaria.","Larsen, Mads Delbo; Lopez-Perez, Mary; Dickson, Emmanuel Kakra; Ampomah, Paulina; Tuikue Ndam, Nicaise; Nouta, Jan; Koeleman, Carolien A.

The global burden of mortality and morbidity associated with this pandemic continues to increase with each passing day as it is progressively leading to multiorgan dysfunction. In most cases, the cause of death has been attributed to respiratory failure, sepsis, cardiac failure, kidney injury, or coagulopathy. As more knowledge is being unfolded, an in-depth understanding of various systemic manifestations and complications of SARS-CoV2 is vital for optimum management of these patients. This novel virus is known to spread faster than its two ancestors, the SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), demonstrating a case fatality ranging from 5 to 8% Max Roser (n.d.) [1]. Hematological abnormalities such as lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated D-Dimer, elevated fibrinogen, elevated fibrinogen degradation products as well as cytokines such as IL-6 are emerging as important prognostic marker for worse outcome of COVID-19. Among various systemic manifestations, hematological complications such as venous thrombosis causing pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis, and arterial thrombosis causing myocardial infarction, strokes or limb ischemia are being noted to be directly linked to high mortality from COVID-19. An attempt to understand the pathophysiology of various hematological abnormalities including cytokine storm, hypercoagulable state and some rare presentations of this disease hence becomes imperative. Through this review, we aim to provide an up-to-date summary of current evidence-based literature of hematological manifestations, their consequences and management including role of anticoagulation and drugs targeting cytokine storm in patients with SARS-CoV-2.","Kaur, Supreet; Bansal, Rashika; Kollimuttathuillam, Sudarsan; Gowda, Anusha Manje; Singh, Balraj; Mehta, Dhruv; Maroules, Michael",Blood Rev,18,20

We aimed to evaluate HACOR (heart rate, acidosis, consciousness, oxygenation, respiratory rate) score performance in these patients as predictor of CPAP failure. METHODS: Prospective observational multicentric study (three centers in different countries), including adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia admitted to a respiratory intermediate care unit, presenting PaO(2)/FiO(2) < 300 and PaCO(2) < 45 mmHg, who received CPAP. One hour after starting CPAP, HACOR was calculated. RESULTS: We enrolled 128 patients, mean age 61,7 years. Mean HACOR at 1 h after starting CPAP was 3,27 ± 3,84 and mean PaO(2)/FiO(2) was 203,30 ± 92,21 mmHg; 35 patients (27,3 %) presented CPAP failure: 29 underwent oro-tracheal intubation and 6 died due to COVID-19 (all having a do-not-intubate order). HACOR accuracy for predicting CPAP failure was 82,03 %, while PaO(2)/FiO2 accuracy was 81,25 %. CONCLUSION: Although HACOR score had a good diagnostic performance in predicting CPAP failure in COVID-19-related ARF, PaO(2)/FiO(2) has also shown to be a good predictor of failure.","Guia, Miguel Filipe; Boléo-Tomé, José Pedro; Imitazione, Pasquale; Polistina, Giorgio Emanuele; Alves, Carlos; Ishikawa, Oki; Ballenberger, Matthew; Mina, Bushra; Fiorentino, Giuseppe; Esquinas, Antonio; Scala, Raffaele",Respir Med,18,24

This study tends to contribute to the development of effective treatment strategies through a computational approach, investigating the mechanisms in relation to the binding and subsequent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA)-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Molecular docking was performed to screen six naturally occurring molecules with antineoplastic properties (Ellipticine, Ecteinascidin, Homoharringtonine, Dolastatin 10, Halichondrin, and Plicamycin). Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) investigation was also conducted to analyze the drug-like properties of these compounds. The docked results have clearly shown binding of ligands to the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp protein. Interestingly, all ligands were found to obey Lipinski’s rule of five.

Therefore, correct emotional regulation is essential to improve nurses’ job well-being and promote better engagement in nursing work. The purpose of this study was to establish a structural model to estimate the impact of Chinese clinical nurses’ emotional intelligence on job well-being, using multiple intermediaries to explain the internal mechanisms underlying the relationship. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 1475 registered nurses from a Chinese hospital who provided responses to emotional intelligence, empathy, communication satisfaction, and job well-being scales. Path analysis using a multiple mediation model was performed using AMOS 23.0. RESULTS: Among all clinical nurses who participated in the survey, 1475 (98.33 %) completed the questionnaire. The nurses’ job well-being score was 83.61 ± 12.63. There was a significant positive correlation between job well-being and communication satisfaction, emotional intelligence, and empathy ability (r = 0.346–0.570, P < 0.001). Empathy and communication satisfaction partially mediated the relationship between emotional intelligence and job well-being, with effect sizes of 0.047 and 0.227, respectively. The chain mediating effect of empathy and communication satisfaction had a value of 0.045. CONCLUSIONS: It is recommended that hospital managers take actions to improve nurses’ emotional intelligence level, and conduct professional psychological training to improve nurses’ empathy and communication satisfaction, and ultimately improve their job well-being.","Li, Xue; Chang, Hongjuan; Zhang, Quanying; Yang, Jianli; Liu, Rui; Song, Yajie",BMC Nurs,18,18

Design We conducted a cross-sectional survey in Dhaka City and other districts of Bangladesh between April 18 and October 12, 2020. We randomly selected 32 districts outside Dhaka, where one village and one mahalla from each district, and from Dhaka City, selected 25 mahallas. From each village or mahalla, we enrolled 120 households through systematic random sampling. Results A total of 44,865 individuals were interviewed from 10,907 households. The majority (70%, n-31488) of the individuals were <40 years of age. Almost half of the individuals (49%, n=21,888) reported >4 members in their households. We estimated, 12.6% (n=160) of the households had ≥1 COVID-19 infected individuals, among them, 0.9% (n=404) individuals had at least one COVID-19 like symptom at the national level. Prevalence of COVID-19 was 6.4% among the general population. Among the COVID-19 positive individuals, 87% were asymptomatic.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using heart failure (HF) as an exemplar, we represented three national EHR sources (Clinical Practice Research Datalink, Hospital Episode Statistics Admitted Patient Care, Office for National Statistics) into the OMOP CDM 5.2. We compared the original and CDM HF patient population by calculating and presenting descriptive statistics of demographics, related comorbidities, and relevant clinical biomarkers. RESULTS: We identified a cohort of 502 536 patients with the incident and prevalent HF and converted 1 099 195 384 rows of data from 216 581 914 encounters across three EHR sources to the OMOP CDM. The largest percentage (65%) of unmapped events was related to medication prescriptions in primary care. The average coverage of source vocabularies was >98% with the exception of laboratory tests recorded in primary care. The raw and transformed data were similar in terms of demographics and comorbidities with the largest difference observed being 3.78% in the prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that the OMOP CDM can successfully be applied to convert EHR linked across multiple healthcare settings and represent phenotyping algorithms spanning multiple sources. Similar to previous research, challenges mapping primary care prescriptions and laboratory measurements still persist and require further work. The use of OMOP CDM in national UK EHR is a valuable research tool that can enable large-scale reproducible observational research.","Papez, Vaclav; Moinat, Maxim; Payralbe, Stefan; Asselbergs, Folkert W; Lumbers, R Thomas; Hemingway, Harry; Dobson, Richard; Denaxas, Spiros",JAMIA Open,18,19

The potential anti-SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) activity of the POMs [α-PTi(2)W(10)O(40)](7−) isomers was investigated in this paper by molecular modeling method. The SARS 3c like protease, namely the SARS 3CL(pro) is the key function protease for virus replication as well as transcription and thus can be taken as one of the key targets for anti-SARS drug design. Affinity/Insight II was used to explore possible binding locations for POMs/3CL(pro) interaction. Charges in the POMs were obtained from density-functional theory (DFT) method. The results show that POMs bind with 3CL(pro) in the active site region with high affinity; POMs are more prone to bind with 3CL(pro) than with some organic compounds; for the POMs/3CL(pro)complex, the OTi(2) in POMs is the vital element for electrostatic interaction, and the electrostatic binding energy is strong enough to keep the complex stable.","Hu, Donghua; Shao, Chen; Guan, Wei; Su, Zhongmin; Sun, Jiazhong",J Inorg Biochem,18,26

The African Centres for Disease Control and Prevention is leading the pandemic response in Africa, with direction from the World Health Organization guidelines for critical preparedness, readiness, and response actions. These are written for national governments, lacking nuance for population and local differences. In the greater Horn of Africa, conditions unique to pastoralists such as inherent mobility and limited health and service infrastructure will influence the dynamics of COVID-19. In this paper, we present a One Health approach to the pandemic, consisting of interdisciplinary and intersectoral collaboration focused on the determinants of health and health outcomes amongst pastoralists. Our contextualized public health strategy includes community One Health teams and suggestions for where to implement targeted public health measures. We also analyse the interaction of COVID-19 impacts, including those caused directly by the disease and those that result from control efforts, with ongoing shocks and vulnerabilities in the region (e.g. desert locusts, livestock disease outbreaks, floods, conflict, and development displacement). We give recommendations on how to prepare for and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and its secondary impacts on pastoral areas. Given that the full impact of COVID-19 on pastoral areas is unknown currently, our health recommendations focus on disease prevention and understanding disease epidemiology. We emphasize targeting pastoral toponymies with public health measures to secure market access and mobility while combating the direct health impacts of COVID-19. A contextualized approach for the COVID-19 public health response in pastoral areas in the Greater Horn of Africa, including how the pandemic will interact with existing shocks and vulnerabilities, is required for an effective response, while protecting pastoral livelihoods and food, income, and nutrition security.","Griffith, Evan F.; Pius, Loupa; Manzano, Pablo; Jost, Christine C.",Pastoralism,18,2

Most previous vaccination attempts against FIPV were unsuccessful because IgG antibodies against the surface protein enhance the infection. However, two studies have shown that poxvirus vectors (vaccinia WR and canarypox) expressing only the FIPV membrane (M) protein can elicit a partially protective immunity which is supposed to be cell-mediated (Virology 181 (1991) 327; International patent WO 97/20054 (1997)). In our study, we report the construction of another poxvirus, the modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), as an expression vector for the FIPV M protein. In this vector, the M gene has been inserted downstream a strong early/late promoter, whereas the two previously described poxviruses expressed the M protein during their early stage only. The immunogenicity of the recombinant MVA-M was evaluated in the murine model which revealed an effect of the vector on the Th1/Th2 balance. The vaccine was then tested in cats to evaluate its efficacy in an FIPV 79-1146 challenge. Vaccinated kittens developed FIPV-specific antibodies after immunization, however, none of them was protected against FIPV. Our results suggest a crucial role for the type of poxviral promoter that must be used to induce an effective immune response against FIPV.","Hebben, Matthias; Duquesne, Véronique; Cronier, Joëlle; Rossi, Bernard; Aubert, André",J Feline Med Surg,18,21

We previously demonstrated that PRV infection induces a specific and lethal inflammatory response, contributing to severe neuropathy in mice. So far, the mechanisms that initiate this neuroinflammation remain unknown. Using a mouse footpad inoculation model, we found that PRV infection rapidly and simultaneously induces high G-CSF and IL-6 levels in several mouse tissues, including the footpad, PNS and central nervous system (CNS) tissues. Interestingly, this global increase occurred before PRV had replicated in dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) neurons and also was independent of systemic inflammation. These high G-CSF and IL-6 levels were not caused by neutrophil infiltration in PRV infected tissues, as we did not detect any neutrophils. Efficient PRV replication and spread in the footpad was sufficient to activate DRGs to produce cytokines. Finally, by using knockout mice, we demonstrated that TLR2 and IFN type I play crucial roles in modulating the early neuroinflammatory response and clinical outcome of PRV infection in mice.

Therefore we assessed iron metabolism markers in COVID-19 patients for their ability to predict disease severity. Methods: COVID-19 patients referred to the Heidelberg University Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into outpatients (cohort A, n=204), inpatients (cohort B, n=81), and outpatients later admitted to hospital because of health deterioration (cohort C, n=23). Results: Iron metabolism parameters were severely altered in patients of cohort B and C compared to cohort A. In multivariate regression analysis including age, gender, CRP and iron-related parameters only serum iron and ferritin were significantly associated with hospitalization. ROC analysis revealed an AUC for serum iron of 0.894 and an iron concentration <6micromol/l as the best cutoff-point predicting hospitalization with a sensitivity of 94.7% and a specificity of 67.9%. When stratifying inpatients in a low- and high oxygen demand group serum iron levels differed significantly between these two groups and showed a high negative correlation with the inflammatory parameters IL-6, procalcitonin, and CRP. Unexpectedly, serum iron levels poorly correlate with hepcidin. Conclusion: We conclude that measurement of serum iron can help predicting the severity of COVID-19. The differences in serum iron availability observed between the low and high oxygen demand group suggest that disturbed iron metabolism likely plays a causal role in the pathophysiology leading to lung injury.","Hippchen, T.; Altamura, S.; Muckenthaler, M.

In this study, we established a sensitive SCoV-2 Spike glycoprotein (SP), including an SP mutant D614G, pseudotyped HIV-1-based vector system and tested their ability to infect ACE2-expressing cells. Based on this system, we have demonstrated that an aqueous extract from the Natural herb Prunella vulgaris (NhPV) displayed potent inhibitory effects on SCoV-2 SP (including SP(G614) mutant) pseudotyped virus (SCoV-2-SP-PVs) mediated infections. Moreover, we have compared NhPV with another compound, Suramin, for their anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities and the mode of their actions, and found that both NhPV and Suramin are able to directly interrupt SCoV-2–SP binding to its receptor ACE2 and block the viral entry step. Importantly, the inhibitory effects of NhPV and Suramin were confirmed by the wild type SARS-CoV-2 (hCoV-19/Canada/ON-VIDO-01/2020) virus infection in Vero cells. Furthermore, our results also demonstrated that the combination of NhPV/Suramin with an anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody mediated a more potent blocking effect against SCoV2-SP-PVs.

Given the increase in the prevalence of violence against women and the fact that women are at greater risk for developing PTSD, it is critical to examine sleep abnormalities in this population. Objectives: To examine subjective and objective sleep quality in young women with PTSD following sexual assault compared with a control group at baseline and after one year of treatment. Methods: Seventy-four women with PTSD following sexual assault and 64 healthy controls with no history of sexual assault were assessed using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5), the Beck Depression Inventory, the Beck Anxiety Inventory, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, and the Insomnia Severity Index. Subjects also underwent full in-lab polysomnography. PTSD participants received pharmacological and/or psychological therapy between baseline and one-year follow-up. Results: The PTSD group had significantly higher scores in the clinical and sleep measurements than the control group. Although the PTSD group reported poorer subjective sleep quality than healthy controls, there were few between-group differences in objective sleep. Analysis of the PTSD group at baseline and one-year follow-up showed that the PSQI global score was a significant predictor of PTSD improvement. Conclusions: Sleep quality is impaired in young women with PTSD and may impact long-term treatment responses. Better sleep quality is significantly associated with PTSD improvement, independent of depression and anxiety.","Yeh, Mary S.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, FCSO quickly implemented comprehensive mitigation policies and adapted MOUD programming. Two major challenges for implementation of the MOUD program were the mandated rapid release of nonviolent pretrial individuals, many of whom were being treated with MOUD and released too quickly to conduct continuity of care planning; and establishing how to deliver physically distanced MOUD services in jail. FCSO implemented and adapted a hub-and-spoke MOUD model, developed telehealth capacity, and experimented with take-home MOUD at release to facilitate continuity-of-care as individuals re-entered the community. Experiences underscore how COVID-19 accelerated the uptake and diffusion of technology-infused OUD treatment and other innovations in criminal justice settings. Looking forward, to address both opioid use disorder and COVID-19, jails and prisons need to develop capacity to implement mitigation strategies, including universal and rapid COVID-19 testing of staff and incarcerated individuals, and be resourced to provide evidence-based addiction treatment. FCSO quickly pivoted and adapted MOUD programming because of its history of applying public health approaches to address the opioid epidemic. Utilizing public health strategies can enable prisons and jails to mitigate the harms of the co-occurring epidemics of OUD and COVID-19, both of which disproportionately affect criminal justice populations, for persons who are incarcerated and the communities to which they return.","Donelan, Christopher J.; Hayes, Ed; Potee, Ruth A.; Schwartz, Levin; Evans, Elizabeth A.",J Subst Abuse Treat,18,17

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to analyze the role of different particle size fractions with respect to respiratory health in Beijing, China. METHODS: Data on particle size distributions from 3 nm to 1 μm; PM(10) (PM ≤ 10 μm), nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), and sulfur dioxide concentrations; and meteorologic variables were collected daily from March 2004 to December 2006. Concurrently, daily counts of emergency room visits (ERV) for respiratory diseases were obtained from the Peking University Third Hospital. We estimated pollutant effects in single- and two-pollutant generalized additive models, controlling for meteorologic and other time-varying covariates. Time-delayed associations were estimated using polynomial distributed lag, cumulative effects, and single lag models. RESULTS: Associations of respiratory ERV with NO(2) concentrations and 100–1,000 nm particle number or surface area concentrations were of similar magnitude—that is, approximately 5% increase in respiratory ERV with an interquartile range increase in air pollution concentration. In general, particles < 50 nm were not positively associated with ERV, whereas particles 50–100 nm were adversely associated with respiratory ERV, both being fractions of ultrafine particles. Effect estimates from two-pollutant models were most consistent for NO(2). CONCLUSIONS: Present levels of air pollution in Beijing were adversely associated with respiratory ERV. NO(2) concentrations seemed to be a better surrogate for evaluating overall respiratory health effects of ambient air pollution than PM(10) or particle number concentrations in Beijing.","Leitte, Arne Marian; Schlink, Uwe; Herbarth, Olf; Wiedensohler, Alfred; Pan, Xiao-Chuan; Hu, Min; Richter, Matthia; Wehner, Birgit; Tuch, Thomas; Wu, Zhijun; Yang, Minjuan; Liu, Liqun; Breitner, Susanne; Cyrys, Josef; Peters, Annette; Wichmann, H.-Erich; Franck, Ulrich",Environ Health Perspect,18,1

Although current evidence does not suggest an atypical acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the physiological response to prone positioning is not fully understood and it is unclear which patients benefit. We aimed to determine whether proning increases oxygenation and to evaluate responders. METHODS: This case series from a single, tertiary university hospital includes all mechanically ventilated patients with COVID‐19 and proning between 17 March 2020 and 19 May 2020. The primary measure was change in PaO(2):FiO(2). RESULTS: Forty‐four patients, 32 males/12 females, were treated with proning for a total of 138 sessions, with median (range) two (1‐8) sessions. Median (IQR) time for the five sessions was 14 (12‐17) hours. In the first session, median (IQR) PaO(2):FiO(2) increased from 104 (86‐122) to 161 (127‐207) mm Hg (P < .001). 36/44 patients (82%) improved in PaO(2):FiO(2), with a significant increase in PaO(2):FiO(2) in the first three sessions. Median (IQR) FiO(2) decreased from 0.7 (0.6‐0.8) to 0.5 (0.35‐0.6) (<0.001). A significant decrease occurred in the first three sessions. PaO(2), tidal volumes, PEEP, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and norepinephrine infusion did not differ. Primarily, patients with PaO(2):FiO(2) approximately < 120 mm Hg before treatment responded to proning. Age, sex, BMI, or SAPS 3 did not predict success in increasing PaO(2):FiO(2). CONCLUSION: Proning increased PaO(2):FiO(2), primarily in patients with PaO(2):FiO(2) approximately < 120 mm Hg, with a consistency over three sessions. No characteristic was associated with non‐responding, why proning may be considered in most patients.

Indeed, in recent years controversy has intensified over strains resistant to carbapenem and/or colistin. Various therapeutic solutions are used to overcome administration of last line antibiotics. In this context, drug repurposing, which consists of using a non-antibiotic compound to treat multi-drug resistant bacteria (MDR), is encouraged. In this review, we first report what may have led to drug repurposing. Main definitions, advantages and drawbacks are summarized. Three major methods are described: phenotypic, computational and serendipity. In a second time we will focus on the current knowledge in drug repurposing for carbapenem and colistin-resistant bacteria with different studies describing repurposed compounds tested on Gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, we show that drug combination therapies can increase successful by drug repurposing strategy. In conclusion, we discuss the pharmaceutical industries that have little interest in reprofiling drugs due to lack of profits.

The rationale for and outcomes with treatments used for SARS and MERS is discussed. The main focus of the review is on drug development and the potential that drugs approved for other indications provide for repurposing. The drugs we discuss belong to a wide range of different drug classes, such as cancer therapeutics, antipsychotics, and antimalarials. In addition to their activity against MERS and SARS coronaviruses, many of these approved drugs have broad-spectrum potential and have already been in clinical use for treating other viral infections. A wealth of knowledge is available for these drugs. However, the information in this review is not meant to guide clinical decisions, and any therapeutic described here should only be used in context of a clinical trial. Potential targets for novel antivirals and antibodies are discussed as well as lessons learned from treatment development for other RNA viruses.

This study aimed to identify immediate areas for system strengthening by comparing the delivery of elective cancer surgery during COVID-19 in periods of lockdown versus light restriction. Methods: This international, prospective cohort study enrolled patients with 15 cancer types who had a decision for surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic up to 31st August 2020. Average national Oxford COVID-19 Stringency Index scores were calculated for each patient during the period they were awaiting surgery, classified into light restrictions (index <20), moderate lockdowns (20-60), and full lockdowns (>60). The primary outcome was the non-operation rate (proportion of patients who did not undergo planned surgery). Cox proportional-hazards regression models were used to explore the associations between lockdowns and non-operation. Results: From 20,006 patients (466 hospitals, 61 countries), 9.1% did not receive surgery after a minimum of 3-months’ follow up (median:23 weeks, IQR:16 to 30 weeks). Light restrictions were associated with a 0.6% non-operation rate, moderate lockdowns 5.5% (adjusted hazard ratio:0.81, 95% confidence interval 0.77-0.84, p<0.001), and full lockdowns with a 15.0% rate (HR:0.51, 0.50-0.53). In sensitivity analyses, this effect was independent of local SARS-CoV-2 rates. Each additional week in lockdown led to a 9% reduction in the likelihood in a patient undergoing their cancer operation. Frail patients, those with advanced cancer, and those in lower-income settings were particularly vulnerable to lockdown effects. Surgery beyond 12-weeks from diagnosis increased during lockdowns (9.1% in light restrictions, 10.4% moderate lockdowns, 23.8% full lockdowns). Conclusions: Cancer surgery systems worldwide were fragile to lockdowns, with one in seven patients not undergoing planned surgery and more preoperative delays. During current and future periods of societal restriction, the resilience of elective surgery systems requires strengthening, which may include ring-fenced surgical units and critical care capacity.

We are studying genetic abnormalities of this death pathway, particularly in the context of autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) and other non-ALPS conditions affecting lymphocyte homeostasis. These studies have led to further investigations of the regulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, the molecular basis for programmed cell death and viral cytopathicity, mechanisms of autoimmunity, and regulation of mature T-cell tolerance.

METHODS: A 4-month retrospective study was conducted. All patients who received systemic glucocorticoids for ≥ 2 days during hospitalisation, with ≥ 2 elevated blood glucose (BG) readings, were included in the analysis. SIH control was determined by mean BG levels, the number and proportion of elevated and pronouncedly elevated BG readings, and the number of hypoglycaemic events. RESULTS: 60 of 283 patients (21.2%) developed SIH, of which 55 patients were included in further analysis. Mean fasting and daytime BG levels were 7.8 ± 2.9 mmol/l and 10.9 ± 2.2 mmol/l, respectively. 41/55 patients (74.5%) had elevated average BG levels. 45/55 patients (81.8%) had > 5 readings or > 20% of all readings exceeding hyperglycaemia threshold, and 33/55 patients (60.0%) had pronouncedly elevated BG levels on more than one occasion. 6/55 patients (10.9%) experienced more than one hypoglycaemic event or a severe hypoglycaemia. Only 9/55 patients (16.4%) achieved adequate SIH control according to all defined criteria. Pre-existing diabetes and longer duration of hospital treatment with low glucocorticoid dose were significantly associated with poorer glycaemic control (p < 0.001 and p = 0.003, respectively).

The ability to predict the progress of this pandemic has been crucial for decision making aimed at fighting this pandemic and controlling its spread. In this work we considered four different statistical/time series models that are readily available from the ‘forecast’ package in R. We performed novel applications with these models, forecasting the number of infected cases (confirmed cases and similarly the number of deaths and recovery) along with the corresponding 90% prediction interval to estimate uncertainty around pointwise forecasts. Since the future may not repeat the past for this pandemic, no prediction model is certain. However, any prediction tool with acceptable prediction performance (or prediction error) could still be very useful for public-health planning to handle spread of the pandemic, and could policy decision-making and facilitate transition to normality. These four models were applied to publicly available data of the COVID-19 pandemic for both the USA and Italy. We observed that all models reasonably predicted the future numbers of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries of COVID-19. However, for the majority of the analyses, the time series model with autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and cubic smoothing spline models both had smaller prediction errors and narrower prediction intervals, compared to the Holt and Trigonometric Exponential smoothing state space model with Box-Cox transformation (TBATS) models. Therefore, the former two models were preferable to the latter models. Given similarities in performance of the models in the USA and Italy, the corresponding prediction tools can be applied to other countries grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic, and to any pandemics that can occur in future.","Gecili, Emrah; Ziady, Assem; Szczesniak, Rhonda D.",PLoS One,18,32

The Dutch Obstetric Telephone Triage System (DOTTS) was developed to provide a basis for assessing urgency of unplanned obstetric care requests by telephone. Reliability and validity are important components in evaluating such (obstetric) triage systems. OBJECTIVE: To determine the reliability of Dutch Obstetric Telephone Triage, by calculating the inter-rater and intra-rater reliability. METHODS: To evaluate the urgency levels of DOTTS by testing inter-rater and intra-rater reliability, 90 vignettes of possible requests were developed. Nineteen participants, from hospitals where DOTTS had been implemented, rated in two rounds a set of ten vignettes. The five urgency levels and five presenting symptoms had an equal spread and had to be entered in accordance with DOTTS per vignette. Urgency levels were dichotomized into high urgency and intermediate urgency. Inter-rater reliability was rated as degree of agreement between two different participants with the same vignette. Intra-rater reliability was rated as agreement by the same participants at different moments in time. The degree of inter-rater and intra-rater reliability was tested using weighted Cohen’s Kappa and ICC. RESULTS: The agreement of urgency level between participants in accordance with predefined urgency level per vignette was 90.5% (95% CI 87.5–93.6) [335 of 370]. Agreement of urgency level between participants was 88.5% (95% CI 84.9–93.0) [177 of 200] and 84.9% (95% CI 78.3–91.4) after re-rating [101 of 119]. Inter-rater reliability of DOTTS expressed as Cohen’s Kappa was 0.77 and as ICC 0.87; intra-rater reliability of DOTTS expressed as Cohen’s Kappa was 0.70 and as ICC 0.82. CONCLUSION: Inter-rater and intra-rater reliability of DOTTS showed substantial correlation, and is comparable to other studies. Therefore, DOTTS is considered reliable.","Engeltjes, Bernice; Rosman, Ageeth; Bertens, Loes C M; Wouters, Eveline; Cronie, Doug; Scheele, Fedde",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,18,16

The results highlight the relationship between psychological symptoms and complex defense mechanisms based on the intellectualization of negative emotions and a positive strategy of reorganization based on emotional elaboration.

In addition to a well-recognized cleavage site at the S1–S2 boundary, a second proteolytic cleavage site has been identified in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) S2 domain (R797). C-terminal to this S2 cleavage site is a conserved region flanked by cysteine residues C822 and C833. Here, we investigated the importance of this well conserved region for SARS-CoV S-mediated fusion activation. We show that the residues between C822–C833 are well conserved across all coronaviruses. Mutagenic analysis of SARS-CoV S, combined with cell–cell fusion and pseudotyped virion infectivity assays, showed a critical role for the core-conserved residues C822, D830, L831, and C833. Based on available predictive models, we propose that the conserved domain flanked by cysteines 822 and 833 forms a loop structure that interacts with components of the SARS-CoV S trimer to control the activation of membrane fusion.","Madu, Ikenna G.; Belouzard, Sandrine; Whittaker, Gary R.",Virology,18,2

Self-care mHealth applications can provide helpful guidelines for COVID-19 prevention or management in case of infection. This study aimed to develop and then assess a self-care smartphone-based application to provide self-care for pregnant women against COVID-19. The present study was conducted in two phases. First, a needs assessment was performed based on the opinions of 30 obstetricians and pregnant women. Then, relying on the results, a smartphone-based application was prototyped and assessed in terms of its usability and user satisfaction. To assess the application, 36 pregnant women (11 infected with COVID-19) were asked to use the application for a week. The QUIS questionnaire 5.5 was used for assessment, and the results were analyzed via descriptive statistics in SPSS 23. According to the obstetricians and pregnant women, of the 41 information requirements, 35 data elements were noted to be essential in the needs assessment. Features of the application were placed in four categories of User's Profile, Lifestyle, Disease Management and Control, and Application Functions (e.g., introducing high-risk places in terms of COVID-19 prevalence in each city, introducing specialized COVID-19 medical centers to pregnant women to receive services, medication management, stress management and control, nutrition and diet management, sleep management, contacting physicians, doctor's appointment reminder, searching the available educational materials, and making application adjustments such as text font, size, and color). With an average score of 7.94 (out of 9), pregnant women rated the application at a good level. The application can be used to reduce anxiety and stress about COVID-19 in mothers, provide access to reliable information to answer possible questions, identify high-risk locations, and provide pregnant women with instant access to healthcare facilities and information related to COVID-19 self-care processes.","Moulaei, Khadijeh; Sheikhtaheri, Abbas; Ghafaripour, Zahra; Bahaadinbeigy, Kambiz",J Healthc Eng,18,21

They are classified into families based on molecular size like HSP27, 40, 70 and 90 etc, and many of them act as cellular chaperones that regulate protein folding and determine the fate of mis-folded or unfolded proteins. Studies have also shown multiple other functions of these proteins such as in cell signalling, transcription and immune response. Deregulation of these proteins leads to devastating consequences, such as cancer, Alzheimer’s disease and other life threatening diseases suggesting their potential importance in life processes. HSPs exist in multiple isoforms, and their biochemical and functional characterization still remains a subject of active investigation. In case of viral infections, several HSP isoforms have been documented to play important roles with few showing pro-viral activity whereas others seem to have an anti-viral role. Earlier studies have demonstrated that HSP40 plays a pro-viral role whereas HSP70 inhibits HIV-1 replication; however, clear isoform-specific functional roles remain to be established. A detailed functional characterization of all the HSP isoforms will uncover their role in cellular homeostasis and also may highlight some of them as potential targets for therapeutic strategies against various viral infections. In this review, we have tried to comprehend the details about cellular HSPs and their isoforms, their role in cellular physiology and their isoform-specific functions in case of virus infection with a specific focus on HIV-1 biology.","Iyer, Kruthika; Chand, Kailash; Mitra, Alapani; Trivedi, Jay; Mitra, Debashis",Cell Stress Chaperones,18,16

Aim: To describe trends of RSV related disease in children in the Northern hemisphere and to propose a low cost clinical surveillance system based on primary care electronic health records (EHR). Methods: Time series analysis of RSV-related disease and virus laboratory-confirmations in children under 5 years old from 1 September 2009 to 16 January 2021. We collected RSV diagnoses from primary care EHR in Catalonia (Spain). We compared the trend of RSV in the season 2020-2021 with that in the previous seasons. We estimated the expected RSV cases with data from 2009 to 2018 using a time series regression adjusted by seasonality. We used the same method to estimate the expected RSV laboratory-confirmations as a sensitivity analysis. Results: In previous seasons, RSV-related disease peaks in Catalonia during the weeks 52 and 53. However in the 2020-2021 period, we observed a reduction of 87.6% (95% CI: 82.7% to 90.3%) in RSV-related disease from october 2020 compared to the expected. Only 1 RSV case was laboratory-confirmed during the 2020-2021 season until mid-January. Conclusions: We observed a nearly absence of RSV-related disease and laboratory-confirmations during the weeks when RSV usually peaks in Catalonia. The use of primary care EHR could be a low-cost surveillance system to monitorize trends of RSV the coming months.","Coma, E.; Vila, J.; Mendez-Boo, L.; Anton, A.; Mora, N.; Fina, F.; Fabregas, M.; Medina, M.",,18,20

Some of these viruses are also equipped with a neuraminidase or a sialyl-O-acetyl-esterase. These receptor-destroying enzymes promote virus release from infected cells and neutralize sialic acid-containing soluble proteins interfering with cell surface binding of the virus.

Furthermore, greater cognitive reflection and science knowledge were associated with stronger discernment. In Study 2, we found that a simple accuracy reminder at the beginning of the study (i.e., judging the accuracy of a non-COVID-19-related headline) nearly tripled the level of truth discernment in participants’ subsequent sharing intentions.

Antipsychotics are the standard pharmacological treatment for schizophrenia, but are frequently discontinued by patients due to inefficacy and/or side effects. Chronic treatment with the typical antipsychotic haloperidol causes tardive dyskinesia (TD), which manifests as involuntary and often irreversible orofacial movements in around 30% of patients. Mice treated with haloperidol develop many of the features of TD, including jaw tremors, tongue protrusions, and vacuous chewing movements (VCMs). In this study, we used genetically diverse Collaborative Cross (CC) recombinant inbred inter-cross (RIX) mice to elucidate the genetic basis of antipsychotic-induced adverse drug reactions (ADRs). We performed a battery of behavioral tests in 840 mice from 73 RIX lines (derived from 62 CC strains) treated with haloperidol or placebo in order to monitor the development of ADRs. We used linear mixed models to test for strain and treatment effects. We observed highly significant strain effects for almost all behavioral measurements investigated (P < 0.001). Further, we observed strong strain-by-treatment interactions for most phenotypes, particularly for changes in distance traveled, vertical activity, and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). Estimates of overall heritability ranged from 0.21 (change in body weight) to 0.4 (VCMs and change in distance traveled) while the portion attributable to the interactions of treatment and strain ranged from 0.01 (for change in body weight) to 0.15 (for change in EPS). Interestingly, close to 30% of RIX mice exhibited VCMs, a sensitivity to haloperidol exposure, approximately similar to the rate of TD in humans chronically exposed to haloperidol. Understanding the genetic basis for the susceptibility to antipsychotic ADRs may be possible in mouse, and extrapolation to humans could lead to safer therapeutic approaches for schizophrenia.","Giusti-Rodríguez, Paola; Xenakis, James G.; Crowley, James J.; Nonneman, Randal J.; DeCristo, Daniela M.; Ryan, Allison; Quackenbush, Corey R.; Miller, Darla R.; Shaw, Ginger D.; Zhabotynsky, Vasyl; Sullivan, Patrick F.; Manuel de Villena, Fernando Pardo; Zou, Fei",G3 (Bethesda),18,1

The association of antihypertensive medications with outcomes in patients with hypertension is not fully described. However, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), responsible for host entry of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) leading to COVID-19, is postulated to be upregulated in patients taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). Here, we evaluated the occurrence of pulmonary adverse drug events (ADEs) in patients with hypertension receiving ACEIs/ARBs to determine if disparities exist between individual drugs within the respective classes using data from the FDA Spontaneous Reporting Systems. For this purpose, we proposed the proportional reporting ratio to provide a statistical summary for the commonality of an ADE for a specific drug as compared to the entire database for drugs in the same or other classes. In addition, a statistical procedure, multiple logistic regression analysis, was employed to correct hidden confounders when causative covariates are underreported or untrusted to correct analyses of drug-ADE combinations. To date, analyses have been focused on drug classes rather than individual drugs which may have different ADE profiles depending on the underlying diseases present. A retrospective analysis of thirteen pulmonary ADEs showed significant differences associated with quinapril and trandolapril, compared to other ACEIs and ARBs. Specifically, quinapril and trandolapril were found to have a statistically significantly higher incidence of pulmonary ADEs compared with other ACEIs as well as ARBs (P < 0.0001) for group comparison (i.e., ACEIs vs. ARBs vs. quinapril vs. trandolapril) and (P ≤ 0.0007) for pairwise comparison (i.e., ACEIs vs. quinapril, ACEIs vs. trandolapril, ARBs vs. quinapril, or ARBs vs. trandolapril). This study suggests that specific members of the ACEI antihypertensive class (quinapril and trandolapril) have a significantly higher cluster of pulmonary ADEs.","Jaberi-Douraki, Majid; Meyer, Emma; Riviere, Jim; Gedara, Nuwan Indika Millagaha; Kawakami, Jessica; Wyckoff, Gerald J.; Xu, Xuan",Sci Rep,18,11

The trigger for activation of apoptosis is regulated by an intricate interplay between cellular and viral proteins, with a strong bearing on IAV replication. Though the knowledge of viral proteins and mechanisms employed by IAV to induce apoptosis has advanced considerably of late, we know relatively little about the repertoire of host factors targeted by viral proteins. Thus, identification of cellular proteins that are hijacked by the virus will help us not only to understand the molecular underpinnings of IAV-induced apoptosis, but also to design future antiviral therapies. Here we show that the nucleoprotein (NP) of IAV directly interacts with and suppresses the expression of API5, a host antiapoptotic protein that antagonizes E2F1-dependent apoptosis. siRNA-mediated depletion of API5, in NP-overexpressed as well as IAV-infected cells, leads to upregulation of apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (APAF1), a downstream modulator of E2F1-mediated apoptosis, and cleavage of caspases 9 and 3, although a reciprocal pattern of these events was observed on ectopic overexpression of API5. In concordance with these observations, annexin V and 7AAD staining assays exhibit downregulation of early and late apoptosis in IAV-infected or NP-transfected cells on overexpression of API5. Most significantly, while overexpression of API5 decreases viral titers, cellular NP protein as well as mRNA levels in IAV-infected A549 cells, silencing of API5 expression causes a steep rise in the same parameters. From the data reported in this manuscript, we propose a proapoptotic role for NP in IAV pathogenesis, whereby it suppresses expression of antiapoptotic factor API5, thus potentiating the E2F1-dependent apoptotic pathway and ensuring viral replication.","Mayank, A K; Sharma, S; Nailwal, H; Lal, S K",Cell Death Dis,18,1

When infected, children generally remain asymptomatic or develop mild disease. A small number of pediatric cases required admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), respiratory support with a mechanical ventilation and additional life-saving interventions. Even if rarely, death can occur. Aim of this manuscript is to highlight the risk factors associated with severe outcome among pediatric patients with COVID-19. MAIN FINDINGS: Early identification of SARS-CoV-2-infected children at risk of developing severe COVID-19 is vital for service planning, as severely affected pediatric patients require high-quality care and should be followed only where an adequately structured PICU is available. However, early identification of children who must be carefully monitored for substantial risk of severe COVID-19 remains difficult. An underlying comorbidity and heart involvement are frequently observed in severe paediatric cases. Reduced left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction < 60%; diastolic dysfunction; and arrhythmias, including ST segment changes, QTc prolongation, and premature atrial or ventricular beat, are the earliest manifestations of heart involvement. Inclusion of heart enzyme serum levels and evaluation of ventricular function among predictive markers could lead to a more effective evaluation of children at risk with proper selection of those to admit to the PICU and with more adequate treatment in case of more severe clinical manifestations. CONCLUSIONS: To appropriately manage severe pediatric COVID-19 cases, greater attention should be paid to risk factors in children and adolescents, especially to cardiovascular alterations (e.g., heart enzyme serum levels and evaluation of ventricular function). Further studies are needed and the development of a validated score based on all the most common presumed markers of disease severity seems essential.","Esposito, Susanna; Caramelli, Fabio; Principi, Nicola",Ital J Pediatr,18,28

Recombinant viral receptor-binding domains (RBDs) are safe vaccine candidates but often have limited efficacy due to the lack of virus-like immunogen display pattern. Here we have developed a novel virus-like nanoparticle (VLP) vaccine that displays 120 copies of SARS-CoV-2 RBD on its surface. This VLP-RBD vaccine mimics virus-based vaccines in immunogen display, which boosts its efficacy, while maintaining the safety of protein-based subunit vaccines. Compared to the RBD vaccine, the VLP-RBD vaccine induced five times more neutralizing antibodies in mice that efficiently blocked SARS-CoV-2 from attaching to its host receptor and potently neutralized the cell entry of variant SARS-CoV-2 strains, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-1-related bat coronavirus. These neutralizing immune responses induced by the VLP-RBD vaccine did not wane during the two-month study period. Furthermore, the VLP-RBD vaccine effectively protected mice from SARS-CoV-2 challenge, dramatically reducing the development of clinical signs and pathological changes in immunized mice.

We designed and tested a highly scalable virtual training curriculum for novice raters using the Oxford NOTECHS non-technical skills rating system. DESIGN A three-day training course comprising virtual didactics, virtually facilitated simulations, and independent live observations was implemented. NOTECHS scores were submitted for eleven standardized video simulations and four live operations. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated for total NOTECHS scores and subcomponent scores. Raters previously trained in-person with the same standardized videos served as a comparator group for equivalence testing. SETTING All study activities were conducted in a large academic tertiary referral center in Singapore as part of an ongoing surgical safety initiative. PARTICIPANTS Seven staff members underwent training (three virtually and four in-person). None had prior surgical experience or non-technical skills assessment training. RESULTS ICCs for total NOTECHS scores were 0.85 (95% CI, 0.73-0.98) for virtually trained raters and 0.83 for those trained in-person (95% CI, 0.68-0.99). Scores were equivalent between groups within a 10% margin. CONCLUSIONS Non-technical skills assessment can be reliably taught in a highly scalable virtual format. Virtual NOTECHS training is a valuable tool for educational and quality improvement initiatives during the COVID-19 pandemic and for centers that lack ready access to onsite non-technical skills training expertise.","Etheridge, James C; Moyal-Smith, Rachel; Sonnay, Yves; Yong, Tze Tein; Lim, Shu Rong; Shafiqah, Nurul; Aung, Yupar; Tan, Hiang Khoon; Havens, Joaquim M",Journal of surgical education,18,16

Individual sPLA(2)s exhibit unique tissue or cellular distributions and enzymatic properties, suggesting their distinct biological roles. Although PLA(2) enzymes, particularly cytosolic PLA(2) (cPLA(2)α), have long been implicated in inflammation by driving arachidonic acid metabolism, the precise biological roles of sPLA(2)s have remained a mystery over the last few decades. Recent studies employing mice gene-manipulated for individual sPLA(2)s, in combination with mass spectrometric lipidomics to identify their target substrates and products in vivo, have revealed their roles in diverse biological events, including immunity and associated disorders, through lipid mediator-dependent or -independent processes in given microenvironments. In this review, we summarize our current knowledge of the roles of sPLA(2)s in various immune responses and associated diseases.","Murakami, M.; Yamamoto, K.; Miki, Y.; Murase, R.; Sato, H.; Taketomi, Y.",Adv Immunol,18,29

In Germany the coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in a slowly growing demand for health care with a sudden occurrence of regional hotspots. This leads to an unpredictable situation for many hospitals, leaving the question of how many bed resources are needed to cope with the surge of COVID-19 patients. OBJECTIVE: In this study we created a simulation-based prognostic tool that provides the management of the University Hospital of Augsburg and the civil protection services with the necessary information to plan and guide the disaster response to the ongoing pandemic. Especially the number of beds needed on isolation wards and intensive care units (ICU) are the biggest concerns. The focus should lie not only on the confirmed cases as the patients with suspected COVID-19 are in need of the same resources. MATERIAL AND METHODS: For the input we used the latest information provided by governmental institutions about the spreading of the disease, with a special focus on the growth rate of the cumulative number of cases. Due to the dynamics of the current situation, these data can be highly variable. To minimize the influence of this variance, we designed distribution functions for the parameters growth rate, length of stay in hospital and the proportion of infected people who need to be hospitalized in our area of responsibility. Using this input, we started a Monte Carlo simulation with 10,000 runs to predict the range of the number of hospital beds needed within the coming days and compared it with the available resources. RESULTS: Since 2 February 2020 a total of 306 patients were treated with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 at this university hospital. Of these 84 needed treatment on the ICU. With the help of several simulation-based forecasts, the required ICU and normal bed capacity at Augsburg University Hospital and the Augsburg ambulance service in the period from 28 March 2020 to 8 June 2020 could be predicted with a high degree of reliability. Simulations that were run before the impact of the restrictions in daily life showed that we would have run out of ICU bed capacity within approximately 1 month. CONCLUSION: Our simulation-based prognosis of the health care capacities needed helps the management of the hospital and the civil protection service to make reasonable decisions and adapt the disaster response to the realistic needs. At the same time the forecasts create the possibility to plan the strategic response days and weeks in advance. The tool presented in this study is, as far as we know, the only one accounting not only for confirmed COVID-19 cases but also for suspected COVID-19 patients. Additionally, the few input parameters used are easy to access and can be easily adapted to other healthcare systems.","Römmele, C.; Neidel, T.; Heins, J.; Heider, S.; Otten, V.; Ebigbo, A.; Weber, T.; Müller, M.; Spring, O.; Braun, G.; Wittmann, M.; Schoenfelder, J.; Heller, A.

We reported the clinical features and therapeutic characteristics of moderate COVID-19 cases in Wuhan that were treated via the integration of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Western medicine. We collected electronic medical record (EMR) data, which included the full clinical profiles of patients, from a designated TCM hospital in Wuhan. The structured data of symptoms and drugs from admission notes were obtained through an information extraction process. Other key clinical entities were also confirmed and normalized to obtain information on the diagnosis, clinical treatments, laboratory tests, and outcomes of the patients. A total of 293 COVID-19 inpatient cases, including 207 moderate and 86 (29.3%) severe cases, were included in our research. Among these cases, 238 were discharged, 31 were transferred, and 24 (all severe cases) died in the hospital. Our COVID-19 cases involved elderly patients with advanced ages (57 years on average) and high comorbidity rates (61%). Our results reconfirmed several well-recognized risk factors, such as age, gender (male), and comorbidities, as well as provided novel laboratory indications (e.g., cholesterol) and TCM-specific phenotype markers (e.g., dull tongue) that were relevant to COVID-19 infections and prognosis. In addition to antiviral/antibiotics and standard supportive therapies, TCM herbal prescriptions incorporating 290 distinct herbs were used in 273 (93%) cases. The cases that received TCM treatment had lower death rates than those that did not receive TCM treatment (17/273 = 6.2% vs. 7/20= 35%, P = 0.0004 for all cases; 17/77= 22% vs. 7/9= 77.7%, P = 0.002 for severe cases). The TCM herbal prescriptions used for the treatment of COVID-19 infections mainly consisted of Pericarpium Citri Reticulatae, Radix Scutellariae, Rhizoma Pinellia, and their combinations, which reflected the practical TCM principles (e.g., clearing heat and dampening phlegm). Lastly, 59% of the patients received treatment, including antiviral, antibiotics, and Chinese patent medicine, before admission. This situation might have some effects on symptoms, such as fever and dry cough. By using EMR data, we described the clinical features and therapeutic characteristics of 293 COVID-19 cases treated via the integration of TCM herbal prescriptions and Western medicine. Clinical manifestations and treatments before admission and in the hospital were investigated. Our results preliminarily showed the potential effectiveness of TCM herbal prescriptions and their regularities in COVID-19 treatment.","Shu, Zixin; Zhou, Yana; Chang, Kai; Liu, Jifen; Min, Xiaojun; Zhang, Qing; Sun, Jing; Xiong, Yajuan; Zou, Qunsheng; Zheng, Qiguang; Ji, Jinghui; Poon, Josiah; Liu, Baoyan; Zhou, Xuezhong; Li, Xiaodong",Front Med,18,27

DESIGN: Monthly assessment of the percentage of women screened from 1(st) April 2016 to the 31(st) December 2020 who were diagnosed as having gestational diabetes SETTING: London Teaching Hospital POPULATION: 28,128 women receiving antenatal care between April 1(st) 2016 and 31 December 2020. METHODS: Retrospective study of prospectively collected data. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion of women screened diagnosed as having gestational diabetes. RESULTS: The mean (SD) percentage of women diagnosed with GDM was 14.78 (2.24) in summer (June, July, August) compared with 11.23 (1.62) in winter (p < 0.001), 12.13 (1.94) in spring (p = 0.002), and 11.88 (2.67) in autumn (p = 0.003).

The factors associated with this psychological impact remain to be determined. Methods: A cross-sectional study using an online questionnaire completed by the staff of a French hospital, two months after the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Results: Among the 353 participants (of whom 67% were healthcare professionals) 32% had symptoms of anxiety, 16% of depression and 16% of PTSD. Eleven % had initiated or increased treatment with sleeping pills, and 6% with anxiolytics. In a multivariate analysis, factors independently associated with anxiety were: change of professional team, having a relative infected by SARS-CoV-2 and a new/increased treatment with sleeping pills or anxiolytics. The only factor associated with depression was the feeling of risk during professional practice. The factors associated with PTSD were: having a relative infected by SARS-CoV-2, the feeling of risk during professional practice, the increase in smoking and treatment with sleeping pills. The observance of transmission preventive measures (TPM) was not associated with the psychological impact of SARS-CoV-2. A personal history of SARS-CoV-2 infection and age < 36 years were associated with insufficient use of protective equipment. Age < 36 years, and being a healthcare professional were associated with the non-observance of social distancing. Conclusion: The hospital staff displayed psychological consequences, resulting in the use of anxiolytics and sleeping pills. Belonging to a group with low-risk of severe disease was associated with lower observance of TPM.","Flateau, C.; Noël, C.; Bonnafoux, A.; Fuentes, E.; de Pontfarcy, A; Diamantis, S.",Infect Dis Now,18,1

In this pilot study we evaluate the use of computer‐based pleural line (p‐line) ultrasound features in comparison to traditional lung texture (TLT) features to test the hypothesis that p‐line thickening and irregularity are highly suggestive of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) and can be used to improve the disease diagnosis on lung ultrasound. METHODS: Twenty lung ultrasound images, including normal and COVID‐19 cases, were used for quantitative analysis. P‐lines were detected by a semiautomated segmentation method. Seven quantitative features describing thickness, margin morphology, and echo intensity were extracted. TLT lines were outlined, and texture features based on run‐length and gray‐level co‐occurrence matrix were extracted. The diagnostic performance of the 2 feature sets was measured and compared using receiver operating characteristics curve analysis. Observer agreements were evaluated by measuring interclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for each feature. RESULTS: Six of 7 p‐line features showed a significant difference between normal and COVID‐19 cases. Thickness of p‐lines was larger in COVID‐19 cases (6.27 ± 1.45 mm) compared to normal (1.00 ± 0.19 mm), P < 0.001. Among features describing p‐line margin morphology, projected intensity deviation showed the largest difference between COVID‐19 cases (4.08 ± 0.32) and normal (0.43 ± 0.06), P < 0.001. From the TLT line features, only 2 features, gray‐level non‐uniformity and run‐length non‐uniformity, showed a significant difference between normal cases (0.32 ± 0.06, 0.59 ± 0.06) and COVID‐19 (0.22 ± 0.02, 0.39 ± 0.05), P = 0.04, respectively. All features together for p‐line showed perfect sensitivity and specificity of 100; whereas, TLT features had a sensitivity of 90 and specificity of 70. Observer agreement for p‐lines (ICC = 0.65–0.85) was higher than for TLT features (ICC = 0.42–0.72). CONCLUSION: P‐line features characterize COVID‐19 changes with high accuracy and outperform TLT features. Quantitative p‐line features are promising diagnostic tools in the interpretation of lung ultrasound images in the context of COVID‐19.","Sultan, Laith R.; Chen, Yale Tung; Cary, Theodore W.; Ashi, Khalid; Sehgal, Chandra M.",J Am Coll Emerg Physicians Open,18,1

DESIGN: Matched cohort analysis (2014–2019) using the Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre primary care database. Risk of common infections, viral infections and gastrointestinal infections (including a subset of culture-confirmed infections), and predictors of common infections, were evaluated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: 18 829 people with IBD were matched to 73 316 controls. People with IBD were more likely to present to primary care with a common infection over the study period (46% vs 37% of controls). Risks of common infections, viral infections and gastrointestinal infections (including stool culture-confirmed infections) were increased for people with ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease compared with matched controls (HR range 1.12–1.83, all p<0.001). Treatment with oral glucocorticoid therapy, immunotherapies and biologic therapy, but not with aminosalicylates, was associated with increased infection risk in people with IBD. Despite mild lymphopenia and neutropenia being more common in people with IBD (18.4% and 1.9%, respectively) than in controls (6.5% and 1.5%, respectively), these factors were not associated with significantly increased infection risk in people with IBD. CONCLUSION: People with IBD are more likely to present with a wide range of common infections.

Several diagnostic strategies are available to identify or rule out current infection, identify people in need of care escalation, or to test for past infection and immune response. Point‐of‐care antigen and molecular tests to detect current SARS‐CoV‐2 infection have the potential to allow earlier detection and isolation of confirmed cases compared to laboratory‐based diagnostic methods, with the aim of reducing household and community transmission. OBJECTIVES: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of point‐of‐care antigen and molecular‐based tests to determine if a person presenting in the community or in primary or secondary care has current SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. SEARCH METHODS: On 25 May 2020 we undertook electronic searches in the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register and the COVID‐19 Living Evidence Database from the University of Bern, which is updated daily with published articles from PubMed and Embase and with preprints from medRxiv and bioRxiv. In addition, we checked repositories of COVID‐19 publications. We did not apply any language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included studies of people with suspected current SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, known to have, or not to have SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, or where tests were used to screen for infection. We included test accuracy studies of any design that evaluated antigen or molecular tests suitable for a point‐of‐care setting (minimal equipment, sample preparation, and biosafety requirements, with results available within two hours of sample collection). We included all reference standards to define the presence or absence of SARS‐CoV‐2 (including reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) tests and established clinical diagnostic criteria). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened studies and resolved any disagreements by discussion with a third review author. One review author independently extracted study characteristics, which were checked by a second review author. Two review authors independently extracted 2x2 contingency table data and assessed risk of bias and applicability of the studies using the QUADAS‐2 tool. We present sensitivity and specificity, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), for each test using paired forest plots. We pooled data using the bivariate hierarchical model separately for antigen and molecular‐based tests, with simplifications when few studies were available. We tabulated available data by test manufacturer. MAIN RESULTS: We included 22 publications reporting on a total of 18 study cohorts with 3198 unique samples, of which 1775 had confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Ten studies took place in North America, two in South America, four in Europe, one in China and one was conducted internationally. We identified data for eight commercial tests (four antigen and four molecular) and one in‐house antigen test. Five of the studies included were only available as preprints. We did not find any studies at low risk of bias for all quality domains and had concerns about applicability of results across all studies. We judged patient selection to be at high risk of bias in 50% of the studies because of deliberate over‐sampling of samples with confirmed COVID‐19 infection and unclear in seven out of 18 studies because of poor reporting. Sixteen (89%) studies used only a single, negative RT‐PCR to confirm the absence of COVID‐19 infection, risking missing infection. There was a lack of information on blinding of index test (n = 11), and around participant exclusions from analyses (n = 10). We did not observe differences in methodological quality between antigen and molecular test evaluations. Antigen tests Sensitivity varied considerably across studies (from 0% to 94%): the average sensitivity was 56.2% (95% CI 29.5 to 79.8%) and average specificity was 99.5% (95% CI 98.1% to 99.9%; based on 8 evaluations in 5 studies on 943 samples). Data for individual antigen tests were limited with no more than two studies for any test. Rapid molecular assays Sensitivity showed less variation compared to antigen tests (from 68% to 100%), average sensitivity was 95.2% (95% CI 86.7% to 98.3%) and specificity 98.9% (95% CI 97.3% to 99.5%) based on 13 evaluations in 11 studies of on 2255 samples. Predicted values based on a hypothetical cohort of 1000 people with suspected COVID‐19 infection (with a prevalence of 10%) result in 105 positive test results including 10 false positives (positive predictive value 90%), and 895 negative results including 5 false negatives (negative predictive value 99%). Individual tests We calculated pooled results of individual tests for ID NOW (Abbott Laboratories) (5 evaluations) and Xpert Xpress (Cepheid Inc) (6 evaluations). Summary sensitivity for the Xpert Xpress assay (99.4%, 95% CI 98.0% to 99.8%) was 22.6 (95% CI 18.8 to 26.3) percentage points higher than that of ID NOW (76.8%, (95% CI 72.9% to 80.3%), whilst the specificity of Xpert Xpress (96.8%, 95% CI 90.6% to 99.0%) was marginally lower than ID NOW (99.6%, 95% CI 98.4% to 99.9%; a difference of −2.8% (95% CI −6.4 to 0.8)) AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review identifies early‐stage evaluations of point‐of‐care tests for detecting SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, largely based on remnant laboratory samples. The findings currently have limited applicability, as we are uncertain whether tests will perform in the same way in clinical practice, and according to symptoms of COVID‐19, duration of symptoms, or in asymptomatic people. Rapid tests have the potential to be used to inform triage of RT‐PCR use, allowing earlier detection of those testing positive, but the evidence currently is not strong enough to determine how useful they are in clinical practice. Prospective and comparative evaluations of rapid tests for COVID‐19 infection in clinically relevant settings are urgently needed. Studies should recruit consecutive series of eligible participants, including both those presenting for testing due to symptoms and asymptomatic people who may have come into contact with confirmed cases.

The COVID‐19 pandemic has prompted intensive research and has changed traditional publishing with the massive adoption of preprints by researchers. Our aim is to investigate whether the crisis and the ensuing scientific and economic competition have changed the lexical content of abstracts. We propose a comparative study of abstracts associated with preprints issued in response to the pandemic relative to abstracts produced during the closest pre‐pandemic period. We show that with the increase (on average and in percentage) of positive words (especially effective) and the slight decrease of negative words, there is a strong increase in hedge words (the most frequent of which are the modal verbs can and may). Hedge words counterbalance the excessive use of positive words and thus invite the readers, who go probably beyond the ‘usual’ audience, to be cautious with the obtained results. The abstracts of preprints urgently produced in response to the COVID‐19 crisis stand between uncertainty and over‐promotion, illustrating the balance that authors have to achieve between promoting their results and appealing for caution.","Bordignon, Frederique; Ermakova, Liana; Noel, Marianne",Learn Publ,18,1

To prevent such school and mental health-related problems, there is a timely need to develop preventive strategies and interventions to address potential negative impacts of COVID-19 on children’s mental health, especially in school settings. Results from previous child clinical research indicate that art-based therapies, including mindfulness-based art therapy, have shown promise to increase children’s well-being and reduce psychological distress. OBJECTIVE: The goal of the present pilot and feasibility study was to compare the impact of an emotion-based directed drawing intervention and a mandala drawing intervention, on mental health in elementary school children (N = 22), in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Both interventions were group-based and delivered online and remotely. A pilot study using a randomized cluster design was implemented to evaluate and compare both interventions in relation to child anxiety, depression, inattention and hyperactivity symptoms. RESULTS: Analyses of covariance revealed a significant effect of the type of drawing intervention on levels of inattention, after controlling for baseline levels. Participants in the emotion-based directed drawing group showed lower inattention scores at post-test, when compared to participants in the mandala group. Post-hoc sensitivity analyses showed significant decreases in pre-to-post scores for levels of hyperactivity for the complete sample. CONCLUSION: Overall, results from this pilot and feasibility study showed that both an emotion-based directed drawing intervention and a mandala drawing intervention may be beneficial to improve mental health in elementary school children, in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic. From a feasibility standpoint, results indicate that the implementation of both interventions online and remotely, through a videoconference platform, is feasible and adequate in school-based settings. Further work incorporating larger sample sizes, longitudinal data and ensuring sufficient statistical power is warranted to evaluate the long-term impact of both interventions on children’s mental health.","Malboeuf-Hurtubise, Catherine; Léger-Goodes, Terra; Mageau, Geneviève A.; Taylor, Geneviève; Herba, Catherine M.; Chadi, Nicholas; Lefrançois, David",Child Adolesc Psychiatry Ment Health,18,9

The study design was cross-sectional. We measured anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in the participants using a laboratory-based quantitative test (Abbott immunoassay), which has a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 99.6%, respectively. To investigate the factors associated with seropositivity, we also obtained some information from the participants with an anonymous questionnaire. We invited 1133 staff members in our hospital, and 925 (82%) participated. The mean age of the participants was 40.0 ± 11.8 years, and most were women (80.0%).

Preclinical trial in mice showed that these LNP vaccines could induce VZV-gE IgG titers more than 16 times those induced by an alum adjuvant, and immunized serum could block in vitro infection completely at a dilution of 1:80, which indicated potential as a varicella vaccine. The magnitude of the cell-mediated immunity induced was generally more than 10 times that induced by the alum adjuvant, indicating potential as a zoster vaccine.

A defined receptor-binding domain (RBD) in MERS-CoV spike protein can potentially serve as a subunit vaccine candidate against MERS-CoV infections. To identify an ideal vaccine candidate, we have constructed five different versions of RBD fragments, S350-588-Fc, S358-588-Fc, S367-588-Fc, S367-606-Fc, and S377-588-Fc (their names indicate their residue range in the spike protein and their C-terminal Fc tag), and further investigated their receptor binding affinity, antigenicity, immunogenicity, and neutralizing potential. The results showed that S377-588-Fc is among the RBD fragments that demonstrated the highest DPP4-binding affinity and induced the highest-titer IgG antibodies in mice. In addition, S377-588-Fc elicited higher-titer neutralizing antibodies than all the other RBD fragments in mice, and also induced high-titer neutralizing antibodies in immunized rabbits. Structural analysis suggests that S377-588-Fc contains the stably folded RBD structure, the full receptor-binding site, and major neutralizing epitopes, such that additional structures to this fragment introduce non-neutralizing epitopes and may also alter the tertiary structure of the RBD. Taken together, our data suggest that the RBD fragment encompassing spike residues 377-588 is a critical neutralizing receptor-binding fragment and an ideal candidate for development of effective MERS vaccines, and that adding non-neutralizing structures to this RBD fragment diminishes its neutralizing potential. Therefore, in viral vaccine design, it is important to identify the most stable and neutralizing viral RBD fragment, while eliminating unnecessary and non-neutralizing structures, as a means of “immunofocusing”.","Ma, Cuiqing; Wang, Lili; Tao, Xinrong; Zhang, Naru; Yang, Yang; Tseng, Chien-Te K; Li, Fang; Zhou, Yusen; Jiang, Shibo; Du, Lanying",Vaccine,18,16

In the absence of a vaccine the best way to fight it is by detecting infected cases early and isolate them to prevent its spread. Therefore, a readily available, rapid, and cost-effective test with high specificity and sensitivity for early detection of COVID 19 is required. In this study, we are testing the diagnostic performance of a rapid antigen detection test in mildly symptomatic cases. (RADT). Methods The study included 4183 male patients who were mildly symptomatic. A nasal sample for the rapid antigen test and a nasopharyngeal sample was taken from each patient. Statistical analysis was conducted to calculate the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and kappa coefficient of agreement. Results The prevalence of COVID 19 in the study population was 17.5% (733/4183). The calculated sensitivity and specificity were 82.1% and 99.1% respectively. Kappa coefficient of agreement between the rapid antigen test and RT-PCR was 0.859 (p < 0.001). A stratified analysis was performed and it showed that the sensitivity of the test improved significantly with lowering the cutoff Ct value to 24. Conclusion The results of the diagnostic assessment of nasal swabs in the RADT used in our study are promising regarding the potential benefit of using them as a screening tool in mildly symptomatic patients. The diagnostic ability was especially high in cases with high viral load. The rapid antigen test is intended to be used alongside RT-PCR and not replace it.

In an effort to understand how early action to find and control the virus is associated with cumulative outcomes, we explored how country-level testing capacity affects later COVID-19 mortality. Methods: We used the Our World in Data database to explore testing and mortality records in 27 countries from December 31, 2019 to September 30, 2020; we applied ordinary-least squares regression with clustering on country to determine the association between early COVID-19 testing capacity (cumulative tests per case) and later COVID-19 mortality (time to specified mortality thresholds), adjusting for country-level confounders, including median age, GDP, hospital bed capacity, population density, and non-pharmaceutical interventions. Results: Higher early testing implementation, as indicated by more cumulative tests per case when mortality was still low, was associated with longer accrual time for higher per capita deaths. For instance, a higher cumulative number of tests administered per case at the time of 6 deaths per million persons was positively predictive of a longer time to reach 15 deaths per million, after adjustment for all confounders (beta=0.659; P=0.001). Conclusions: Countries that developed stronger COVID-19 testing capacity at early timepoints, as measured by tests administered per case identified, experienced a slower increase of deaths per capita. Thus, this study operationalizes the value of testing and provides empirical evidence that stronger testing capacity at early timepoints is associated with reduced mortality and better pandemic control.","Kannoth, S.; Kandula, S.; Shaman, J.",,18,33

The objectives were to identify the uses of 3D printing during the COVID-19 pandemic, determine the extent of preclinical testing, comparison to commercial alternatives, presence of regulatory approvals and replicability regarding the description of the printing parameters and the availability of the print file. Results Literature searches of MEDLINE (OVID interface)/ PubMed identified 601 studies. Of these, 10 studies fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Reported uses of 3D printing included personal protective equipment (PPE), nasopharyngeal swabs and adjunctive anaesthetic equipment. Few studies undertook formal safety and efficacy testing before clinical use with only one study comparing to the commercial equivalent. Six articles made their model print files available for wider use. Conclusion We describe a protocol for a systematic review of 3D-printed healthcare solutions in response to COVID-19.

These range from a better understanding of human disease at a molecular level, allowing the discovery and development of novel biopharmaceuticals and vaccines, to the improvement of biotechnological processes providing improved food quality and safety, efficient green fuels, and smart textiles. Among these applications, the significance of pathogen diagnostics as the main focus of this Account has become particularly clear during the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In this context, while RT-PCR is the gold standard method for unambiguous detection of genetic material from pathogens, other isothermal amplification alternatives circumventing rapid heating-cooling cycles up to ∼95 °C are appealing to facilitate the translation of the assay into point-of-care (PoC) analytical platforms. Furthermore, the possibility of routinely multiplexing the detection of tens to hundreds of target sequences with single base pair specificity, currently not met by state-of-the-art methods available in clinical laboratories, would be instrumental along the path to tackle emergent viral variants and antimicrobial resistance genes. Here, we advocate that padlock probes (PLPs), first reported by Nilsson et al. in 1994, coupled with rolling circle amplification (RCA), termed here as PLP-RCA, is an underexploited technology in current arena of isothermal nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) providing an unprecedented degree of multiplexing, specificity, versatility, and amenability to integration in miniaturized PoC platforms. Furthermore, the intrinsically digital amplification of PLP-RCA retains spatial information and opens new avenues in the exploration of pathogenesis with spatial multiomics analysis of infected cells and tissue.The Account starts by introducing PLP-RCA in a nutshell focusing individually on the three main assay steps, namely, (1) PLP design and ligation mechanism, (2) RCA after probe ligation, and (3) detection of the RCA products. Each subject is touched upon succinctly but with sufficient detail for the reader to appreciate some assay intricacies and degree of versatility depending on the analytical challenge at hand. After familiarizing the reader with the method, we discuss specific examples of research in our group and others using PLP-RCA for viral, bacterial, and fungal diagnostics in a variety of clinical contexts, including the genotyping of antibiotic resistance genes and viral subtyping. Then, we dissect key developments in the miniaturization and integration of PLP-RCA to minimize user input, maximize analysis throughput, and expedite the time to results, ultimately aiming at PoC applications. These developments include molecular enrichment for maximum sensitivity, spatial arrays to maximize analytical throughput, automation of liquid handling to streamline the analytical workflow in miniaturized devices, and seamless integration of signal transduction to translate RCA product titers (and ideally spatial information) into a readable output. Finally, we position PLP-RCA in the current landscape of NAATs and furnish a systematic Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats analysis to shine light upon unpolished edges to uncover the gem with potential for ubiquitous, precise, and unbiased pathogen diagnostics.","Soares, R.

Finally, analytical specificity was characterized in samples with evidence of the Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) (n = 9), cytomegalovirus (CMV) (n = 7), and endemic common-cold coronavirus infections (n = 12) taken prior to the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The diagnostic accuracy was comparable in all three assays (AUC 0.98). Using the manufacturers' cut-offs, the sensitivities were 90%, 95% confidence interval [84,94] (LIA), 93% [88,96] (CMIA), and 96% [91,98] (ECLIA). The specificities were 99.5% [98.9,99.8] (CMIA), 99.7% [99.3,99.9] (LIA), and 99.9% [99.5,99.98] (ECLIA). The LR at half of the manufacturers' cut-offs were 60 (CMIA), 82 (LIA), and 575 (ECLIA) for positive and 0.043 (CMIA) and 0.035 (LIA, ECLIA) for negative results. ECLIA had higher PPV at low pretest probabilities than CMIA and LIA. No interference with EBV or CMV infection was observed, whereas endemic coronavirus in some cases provided signals in LIA and/or CMIA. Although the diagnostic accuracy of the three investigated assays is comparable, their performance in low-prevalence settings is different. Introducing gray zones at half of the manufacturers' cut-offs is suggested, especially for orthogonal testing approaches that use a second assay for confirmation.","Weber, Myriam C.; Risch, Martin; Thiel, Sarah L.; Grossmann, Kirsten; Nigg, Susanne; Wohlwend, Nadia; Lung, Thomas; Hillmann, Dorothea; Ritzler, Michael; Ferrara, Francesca; Bigler, Susanna; Egli, Konrad; Bodmer, Thomas; Imperiali, Mauro; Salimi, Yacir; Fleisch, Felix; Cusini, Alexia; Heer, Sonja; Renz, Harald; Paprotny, Matthias; Kohler, Philipp; Vernazza, Pietro; Risch, Lorenz; Kahlert, Christian R.",Dis Markers,18,29

Herein, we describe the trends of respiratory pathogens in a major metropolitan health care system central microbiology reference laboratory before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, with attention to when COVID-19 mitigation measures were implemented and relaxed. During the initial lockdown period, COVID-19 was the primary respiratory pathogen detected by multiplex respiratory panels. As COVID-19 containment measures were relaxed, the first non-COVID respiratory viruses to return to prepandemic levels were members of the rhinovirus/enterovirus family. After the complete removal of COVID-19 precautions at the state level, including an end to mask mandates, we observed the robust return of seasonal coronaviruses, parainfluenza virus, and respiratory syncytial virus. Inasmuch as COVID-19 has dominated the landscape of respiratory infections since early 2020, it is important for clinicians to recognize that the return of non-COVID respiratory pathogens may be rapid and significant when COVID-19 containment measures are removed. IMPORTANCE We describe the return of non-COVID respiratory viruses after the removal of COVID-19 mitigation measures. It is important for the public and physicians to recognize that, after months of COVID-19 being the primary driver of respiratory infection, more typical seasonal respiratory illnesses have returned, and this return is out of the normal season for some of these pathogens. Thus, clinicians and the public must now consider both COVID-19 and other respiratory illnesses when a patient presents with symptomatic respiratory illness.","Hodjat, Parsa; Christensen, Paul A; Subedi, Sishir; Bernard, David W; Olsen, Randall J; Long, S Wesley",Microbiol Spectr,18,33

A scarcity of information describing design and performance criteria for PAPRs represents a substantial barrier to mitigating shortages. We sought to apply open-source product development (OSPD) to PAPRs to enable alternative sources of supply and further innovation. We describe the design, prototyping, validation, and user testing of locally manufactured, modular, PAPR components, including filter cartridges and blower units, developed by the Greater Boston Pandemic Fabrication Team (PanFab). Two designs, one with a fully custom-made filter and blower unit housing, and the other with commercially available variants (the “Custom” and “Commercial” designs, respectively) were developed; the components in the Custom design are interchangeable with those in Commercial design, although the form factor differs. The engineering performance of the prototypes was measured and safety validated using National Institutes for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-equivalent tests on apparatus available under pandemic conditions at university laboratories. Feedback was obtained from four individuals; two clinicians working in ambulatory clinical care and two research technical staff for whom PAPR use is standard occupational PPE; these individuals were asked to compare PanFab prototypes to commercial PAPRs from the perspective of usability and suggest areas for improvement. Respondents rated the PanFab Custom PAPR a 4 to 5 on a 5 Likert-scale 1) as compared to current PPE options, 2) for the sense of security with use in a clinical setting, and 3) for comfort compared to standard, commercially available PAPRs. The three other versions of the designs (with a Commercial blower unit, filter, or both) performed favorably, with survey responses consisting of scores ranging from 3 to 5. Engineering testing and clinical feedback demonstrate that the PanFab designs represent favorable alternatives to traditional PAPRs in terms of user comfort, mobility, and sense of security.

We included critically ill non-bleeding adult patients without liver failure or anticoagulation treatment, with Owren PT > 1.2, who were prescribed intravenous vitamin K1. Blood was drawn at baseline and at 20–28 h after vitamin K1 administration. At both time points, we measured various vitamin K-dependent proteins and coagulation assays. ClinicalTrials.gov; Identifier: NTC3782025. In total, 52 patients were included. Intravenous vitamin K1 reduced Owren PT, Quick PT, protein induced by vitamin K absence/antagonist-II and desphospho-uncarboxylated matrix Gla protein (dp-ucMGP), but not to normal levels. Concomitantly, there were increases in thrombin generation and the activity of coagulation factors II, VII, IX and X that was only counteracted with a small increase in Protein C activity. In conclusion, the results suggest that vitamin K1 strengthens coagulation as measured by PT decrease and increases in the activity of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors and thrombin generation. The decreased dp-ucMGP, and its potential positive short- and long-term non-coagulative effects, merits further research.","Dahlberg, Sofia; Schött, Ulf; Eriksson, Emilia Ängeby; Tahirsylaj, Yllnor; Schurgers, Leon; Kander, Thomas",Nutrients,18,26

The spectrum of thrombotic events is wide, including in situ pulmonary thrombosis, deep-vein thrombosis and associated pulmonary embolism, as well as arterial thrombotic events (stroke, myocardial infarction, limb artery thrombosis). Unusual thrombotic events have also been reported, e.g., cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, mesenteric artery and vein thrombosis. Several hematology abnormalities have been observed in COVID-19 patients, including lymphopenia, neutrophilia, thrombocytopenia (usually mild), thrombocytosis, elevated prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin times (the latter abnormality often indicating lupus anticoagulant phenomenon), hyperfibrinogenemia, elevated von Willebrand factor levels, and elevated fibrin d-dimer. Many of these abnormal hematologic parameters—even as early as the time of initial hospital admission—indicate adverse prognosis, including greater frequency of progression to severe respiratory illness and death. Progression to overt disseminated intravascular coagulation in fatal COVID-19 has been reported in some studies, but not observed in others. We compare and contrast COVID-19 hypercoagulability, and associated increased risk of venous and arterial thrombosis, from the perspective of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), including the dilemma of providing thromboprophylaxis and treatment recommendations when available data are limited to observational studies. The frequent use of heparin—both low-molecular-weight and unfractionated—in preventing and treating COVID-19 thrombosis, means that vigilance for HIT occurrence is required in this patient population.","Warkentin, Theodore E.; Kaatz, Scott",Thromb Res,18,16

Therapeutic approaches to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection are mostly focused on blocking S-ACE2 binding, but critical residues that stabilize this interaction are not well understood. By performing all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we identified an extended network of salt bridges, hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, and hydrogen bonding between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein and ACE2. Mutagenesis of these residues on the RBD was not sufficient to destabilize binding but reduced the average work to unbind the S protein from ACE2. In particular, the hydrophobic end of RBD serves as the main anchor site and unbinds last from ACE2 under force. We propose that blocking the hydrophobic surface of RBD via neutralizing antibodies could prove an effective strategy to inhibit S-ACE2 interactions.","Taka, Elhan; Yilmaz, Sema Z.; Golcuk, Mert; Kilinc, Ceren; Aktas, Umut; Yildiz, Ahmet; Gur, Mert",bioRxiv,18,26

In veterinary medicine, zoonoses present a risk to practitioners, yet little is known about how these risks are understood and how this translates into health protective behaviour. This study aimed to explore risk perceptions within the British veterinary profession and identify motivators and barriers to compliance with IPCs. A cross-sectional study was conducted using veterinary practices registered with the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons. Here we demonstrate that compliance with IPCs is influenced by more than just knowledge and experience, and understanding of risk is complex and multifactorial. Out of 252 respondents, the majority were not concerned about the risk of zoonoses (57.5%); however, a considerable proportion (34.9%) was. Overall, 44.0% of respondents reported contracting a confirmed or suspected zoonoses, most frequently dermatophytosis (58.6%). In veterinary professionals who had previous experience of managing zoonotic cases, time or financial constraints and a concern for adverse animal reactions were not perceived as barriers to use of personal protective equipment (PPE). For those working in large animal practice, the most significant motivator for using PPE was concerns over liability. When assessing responses to a range of different “infection control attitudes”, veterinary nurses tended to have a more positive perspective, compared with veterinary surgeons. Our results demonstrate that IPCs are not always adhered to, and factors influencing motivators and barriers to compliance are not simply based on knowledge and experience. Educating veterinary professionals may help improve compliance to a certain extent, however increased knowledge does not necessarily equate to an increase in risk-mitigating behaviour. This highlights that the construction of risk is complex and circumstance-specific and to get a real grasp on compliance with IPCs, this construction needs to be explored in more depth.","Robin, Charlotte; Bettridge, Judy; McMaster, Fiona",Prev Vet Med,18,16

Yet the effect of class size on transmission is unknown. To determine whether smaller classes reduce school absence, especially when community disease prevalence is high, we merge data from the Project STAR randomized class size trial with influenza and pneumonia data from the 122 Cities Mortality Reporting System on deaths from pneumonia and influenza. Project STAR was a block-randomized trial that followed 10,816 Tennessee schoolchildren from kindergarten in 1985-86 through third grade in 1988-89. Children were assigned at random to small classes (13 to 17 students), regular-sized classes (22 to 26 students), and regular-sized class with a teachers aide. Mixed effects regression showed that small classes reduced absence, but not necessarily by reducing infection. In particular, small classes reduced absence by 0.43 days/year (95% CI -0.06 to -0.80, p<0.05), but had no significant interaction with pneumonia and influenza mortality (95% CI -0.27 to +0.30, p>0.90).

Here, we describe the development and application of a multiplex microsphere-based immunoassay (MMIA) for COVD-19 antibody studies, utilizing serum samples from non-human primate SARS-CoV-2 infection models, an archived human sera bank and subjects enrolled at five U.S. military hospitals. The MMIA incorporates prefusion stabilized spike glycoprotein trimers of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and the seasonal human coronaviruses HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, into a multiplexing system that enables simultaneous measurement of off-target pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies. We report the sensitivity and specificity performances for this assay strategy at 98% sensitivity and 100% specificity for subject samples collected as early as 10 days after the onset of symptoms. In archival sera collected prior to 2019 and serum samples from subjects PCR negative for SARS-CoV-2, we detected seroprevalence of 72% and 98% for HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-0C43, respectively. Requiring only 1.25 μL of sera, this approach permitted the simultaneous identification of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion and polyclonal SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody responses to SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, further demonstrating the presence of conserved epitopes in the spike glycoprotein of zoonotic betacoronaviruses.

Differentiation between pure viral COVID-19 pneumonia and secondary infection can be challenging. In patients with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) on admission physicians often decide to prescribe antibiotic therapy. However, overuse of anti-infective therapy in the pandemic should be avoided to prevent increasing antimicrobial resistance. Procalcitonin (PCT) and CRP have proven useful in other lower respiratory tract infections and might help to differentiate between pure viral or secondary infection. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of patients admitted with COVID-19 between 6th March and 30th October 2020. Patient background, clinical course, laboratory findings with focus on PCT and CRP levels and microbiology results were evaluated. Patients with and without secondary bacterial infection in relation to PCT and CRP were compared. Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, the best discriminating cut-off value of PCT and CRP with the corresponding sensitivity and specificity was calculated. RESULTS: Out of 99 inpatients (52 ICU, 47 Non-ICU) with COVID-19, 32 (32%) presented with secondary bacterial infection during hospitalization. Patients with secondary bacterial infection had higher PCT (0.4 versus 0.1 ng/mL; p = 0.016) and CRP (131 versus 73 mg/L; p = 0.001) levels at admission and during the hospital stay (2.9 versus 0.1 ng/mL; p < 0.001 resp. 293 versus 94 mg/L; p < 0.001). The majority of patients on general ward had no secondary bacterial infection (93%). More than half of patients admitted to the ICU developed secondary bacterial infection (56%). ROC analysis of highest PCT resp. CRP and secondary infection yielded AUCs of 0.88 (p < 0.001) resp. 0.86 (p < 0.001) for the entire cohort. With a PCT cut-off value at 0.55 ng/mL, the sensitivity was 91% with a specificity of 81%; a CRP cut-off value at 172 mg/L yielded a sensitivity of 81% with a specificity of 76%. CONCLUSION: PCT and CRP measurement on admission and during the course of the disease in patients with COVID-19 may be helpful in identifying secondary bacterial infections and guiding the use of antibiotic therapy.","Pink, Isabell; Raupach, David; Fuge, Jan; Vonberg, Ralf-Peter; Hoeper, Marius M.; Welte, Tobias; Rademacher, Jessica",Infection,18,16

The positive single-strand RNA genome of its causative agent, the SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), encodes all viral enzymes. In this work, we focused on one particular methyltransferase (MTase), nsp16, which, in complex with nsp10, is capable of methylating the first nucleotide of a capped RNA strand at the 2′-O position. This process is part of a viral capping system and is crucial for viral evasion of the innate immune reaction. In light of recently discovered non-canonical RNA caps, we tested various dinucleoside polyphosphate-capped RNAs as substrates for nsp10-nsp16 MTase. We developed an LC-MS-based method and discovered four types of capped RNA (m(7)Gp(3)A(G)- and Gp(3)A(G)-RNA) that are substrates of the nsp10-nsp16 MTase. Our technique is an alternative to the classical isotope labelling approach for the measurement of 2′-O-MTase activity. Further, we determined the IC(50) value of sinefungin to illustrate the use of our approach for inhibitor screening. In the future, this approach may be an alternative technique to the radioactive labelling method for screening inhibitors of any type of 2′-O-MTase.","Benoni, Roberto; Krafcikova, Petra; Baranowski, Marek R.; Kowalska, Joanna; Boura, Evzen; Cahová, Hana",Viruses,18,26

There is a growing body of evidence suggesting a close link exists between an increased risk of infection and an increased severity of lung injury and mortality, in patients infected with COVID-19 who have existing hypertension. This is thought to be due to the possible involvement of the virus target receptor, ACE2, in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone blood pressure management system. Objective: To investigate the association between hypertension as an existing comorbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: A systematic literature search in several databases was performed to identify studies that comment on hypertension as an existing comorbidity, and its effect on mortality in hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID- 19 infection. The results of these studies were then pooled, and a meta-analysis was peformed to assess the overall effect of hypertension as an existing comorbidity on risk of mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 positive patients. Results: A total of 12243 hospitalised patients were pooled from 19 studies. All studies demonstrated a higher fatality rate in hypertensive COVID-19 patients when compared to non-hypertensive patients. Meta-analysis of the pooled studies also demonstrated that hypertension was associated with increased mortality in hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection (risk ratio (RR) 2.57 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.10, 3.14), p < 0.001; I2 =74.98%). Conclusion: Hypertension is associated with 157% increased risk of mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 positive patients. These results have not been adjusted for age, and a meta-regression of covariates including age is required to make these findings more conclusive.","Whiteman, E.",,18,29

Rapid detection of foot‐and‐mouth disease virus (FMDV) is critical to containing an FMD outbreak. Availability of a rapid, highly sensitive and specific, yet simple and field‐deployable assay would support local decision‐making during an FMDV outbreak. Here we report validation of a novel reverse transcription‐insulated isothermal PCR (RT‐iiPCR) assay that can be performed on a commercially available, compact and portable POCKIT (™) analyser that automatically analyses data and displays ‘+’ or ‘−’ results. The FMDV RT‐iiPCR assay targets the 3D region of the FMDV genome and was capable of detecting 9 copies of in vitro‐transcribed RNA standard with 95% confidence. It accurately identified 63 FMDV strains belonging to all seven serotypes and showed no cross‐reactivity with viruses causing similar clinical diseases in cloven‐hoofed animals. The assay was able to identify FMDV RNA in multiple sample types including oral, nasal and lesion swabs, epithelial tissue suspensions, vesicular and oral fluid samples, even before the appearance of clinical signs. Clinical sensitivity of the assay was comparable or slightly higher than the laboratory‐based real‐time RT‐PCR assay in use. The assay was able to detect FMDV RNA in vesicular fluid samples without nucleic acid extraction. For RNA extraction from more complex sample types, a commercially available taco(™) mini transportable magnetic bead‐based, automated extraction system was used. This assay provides a potentially useful field‐deployable diagnostic tool for rapid detection of FMDV in an outbreak in FMD‐free countries or for routine diagnostics in endemic countries with less structured laboratory systems.","Ambagala, A.; Fisher, M.; Goolia, M.; Nfon, C.; Furukawa‐Stoffer, T.; Ortega Polo, R.; Lung, O.",Transbound Emerg Dis,18,16

In June 2020, Public Health England (PHE) initiated prospective national surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in primary schools across England (sKIDs). We used this opportunity to assess the feasibility and agreeability of large-scale surveillance and testing for SARS-CoV-2 infections in school among staff, parents and students. METHODS: Staff and students in 131 primary schools were asked to complete a questionnaire at recruitment and provide weekly nasal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing (n = 86) or swabs with blood samples for antibody testing (n = 45) at the beginning and end the summer half-term. In six blood sampling schools, students were asked to complete a pictorial questionnaire before and after their investigations. RESULTS: In total, 135 children aged 4–7 years (n = 40) or 8–11 years (n = 95) completed the pictorial questionnaire fully or partially. Prior to sampling, oral fluid sampling was the most acceptable test (107/132, 81%) followed by throat swabs (80/134, 59%), nose swabs (77/132, 58%), and blood tests (48/130, 37%). Younger students were more nervous about all tests than older students but, after completing their tests, most children reported a “better than expected” experience with all the investigations. Students were more likely to agree to additional testing for nose swabs (93/113, 82%) and oral fluid (93/114, 82%), followed by throat swabs (85/113, 75%) and blood tests (72/108, 67%). Parents (n = 3,994) and staff (n = 2,580) selected a preference for weekly testing with nose swabs, throat swabs or oral fluid sampling, although staff were more flexible about testing frequency. CONCLUSIONS: Primary school staff and parents were supportive of regular tests for SARS-CoV-2 and selected a preference for weekly testing. Children preferred nose swabs and oral fluids over throat swabs or blood sampling.","Aiano, Felicity; Jones, Samuel E.

In order to reduce the risks of infections and mortality, several interventions such as mobility restrictions for different age groups and vaccination prioritization programs are implemented in the Philippines. Identifying age-sex composition with greater susceptibility, longer hospitalization, and higher fatality is useful to guide the targeted intervention and establish risk stratification for patients infected with COVID-19 within communities and localities. Furthermore, it is also helpful in the allocation of medical resources and assessment of vaccination priority. We analyzed the COVID-19 data provided by the Davao Center for Health Development of the Department of Health Davao Region in the Philippines. The dataset contains records of COVID-19 cases reported from March 2020 to April 2021. Methods that were used include descriptive statistics, graphical presentations, and nonparametric statistical methods. The study reveals that male children and female senior citizens are the most susceptible age-sex composition while male senior citizen is the subgroup with the highest case fatality and mortality. Furthermore, regardless of sex groups, the senior citizen is the subgroup with the longest hospitalization. Susceptibility due to exposure should be included as a criterion in determining the age-sex compositions for vaccination priority against COVID-19 and other potentially deadly viruses. Further, Proper planning and allocation of medical resources for the elderly should be prioritized in the provincial levels.","Ceballos, R.",,18,1

The relative risk of hospitalization was 1.35, 1.58, and 1.50 (p < 0.001) for HW, HB, and HM individuals respectively when compared to NHW. Relative risk of death was 1.36, 1.72, 1.68 (p < 0.001) times higher in HW, HB, and HM compared to NHW. HW, HB, and HM individuals also had significantly increased risk of requiring mechanical ventilation and ICU admission when compared to NHW.

OBJECTIVE: To review current evidence on air contamination with SARS-CoV-2 in hospital settings and the factors associated with contamination, including viral load and particle size. EVIDENCE REVIEW: The MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science databases were systematically queried for original English-language articles detailing SARS-CoV-2 air contamination in hospital settings between January 1 and October 27, 2020. This study was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. The positivity rate of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA and culture were described and compared according to the setting, clinical context, air ventilation system, and distance from patients. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in copies per meter cubed of air were pooled, and their distribution was described by hospital areas. Particle sizes and SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in copies or median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) per meter cubed were analyzed after categorization as less than 1 μm, from 1 to 4 μm, and greater than 4 μm. FINDINGS: Among 2284 records identified, 24 cross-sectional observational studies were included in the review. Overall, 82 of 471 air samples (17.4%) from close patient environments were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, with a significantly higher positivity rate in intensive care unit settings (intensive care unit, 27 of 107 [25.2%] vs non–intensive care unit, 39 of 364 [10.7%]; P < .001). There was no difference according to the distance from patients (≤1 m, 3 of 118 [2.5%] vs >1-5 m, 13 of 236 [5.5%]; P = .22). The positivity rate was 5 of 21 air samples (23.8%) in toilets, 20 of 242 (8.3%) in clinical areas, 15 of 122 (12.3%) in staff areas, and 14 of 42 (33.3%) in public areas. A total of 81 viral cultures were performed across 5 studies, and 7 (8.6%) from 2 studies were positive, all from close patient environments. The median (interquartile range) SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations varied from 1.0 × 10(3) copies/m(3) (0.4 × 10(3) to 3.1 × 10(3) copies/m(3)) in clinical areas to 9.7 × 10(3) copies/m(3) (5.1 × 10(3) to 14.3 × 10(3) copies/m(3)) in the air of toilets or bathrooms. Protective equipment removal and patient rooms had high concentrations per titer of SARS-CoV-2 (varying from 0.9 × 10(3) to 40 × 10(3) copies/m(3) and 3.8 × 10(3) to 7.2 × 10(3) TCID50/m(3)), with aerosol size distributions that showed peaks in the region of particle size less than 1 μm; staff offices had peaks in the region of particle size greater than 4 μm. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this systematic review, the air close to and distant from patients with coronavirus disease 2019 was frequently contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 RNA; however, few of these samples contained viable viruses. High viral loads found in toilets and bathrooms, staff areas, and public hallways suggest that these areas should be carefully considered.","Birgand, Gabriel; Peiffer-Smadja, Nathan; Fournier, Sandra; Kerneis, Solen; Lescure, François-Xavier; Lucet, Jean-Christophe",JAMA Netw Open,18,1

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to share pathological observations of autopsies performed at the 37 Military Hospital’s Department of Anatomical Pathology on three presumed COVID-19 cases in Accra, Ghana. METHOD: Complete autopsies with detailed gross and histopathological analysis were conducted between April 2020 and May 2020 on three suspected COVID-19 cases, of which two had initial negative (rRT-PCR) nasopharyngeal tests. Postmortem bronchopulmonary samples of two cases were collected and tested by rRT-PCR for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). RESULTS: The two postmortem bronchopulmonary samples tested for SARS-CoV-2 by rRT-PCR were positive. Though no postmortem bronchopulmonary sample was taken from the third case, a close contact tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in later contact tracing. For all three cases, lung histopathological findings were consistent with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. CONCLUSION: The outcome of COVID-19 testing is dependent on the sample type and accuracy of sampling amongst other factors. Histopathological findings vary and may be dependent on a patient’s modifying factors, as well as the duration of infection. More autopsies are required to fully understand the pathogenesis of this disease in Ghanaians.","Attoh, Seth A.; Hobenu, Frederick; Edusei, Lawrence; Agyeman-Bediako, Kwasi; Laryea, Clement T.; Nyarko, Edward O.; Amedi, Michael K.; Asmah, Richard H.; Asumanu, Edward; McAddy, Mary; Maison, Anthony; Nyarko, Godwin; Fatchu, Raymond D.; Akakpo, Kafui",Afr J Lab Med,18,2

With Western post-industrial societies becoming more culturally diverse, the present study provides novel cross-nationally comparative evidence on gender socialisation processes among native and immigrant youth in Sweden, Germany, England, and the Netherlands, which vary in gender and migration policies and cultures. In addition to parents’ gender ideologies, the study also considers classmates’ gender ideologies as factors shaping 14-year-old adolescents’ gender ideologies. The analysis draws on 5917 adolescent-parent dyads from the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study which we link with country-level gender empowerment measures from the United Nations. Remarkably, with the exception of native female adolescents in England and Germany, parents tend to report slightly more egalitarian beliefs than adolescents across the four countries. OLS regressions show that parents’ and classmates’ gender ideologies correlate significantly with adolescents’ ideologies, with little variation across gender and immigrant groups in all four countries.

The objective was to examine whether an association between COVID-19-confirmed case numbers and levels of mobility was apparent, and if so then to examine whether such data enhance disease modelling and prediction. CMR data for countries worldwide were cross-correlated with corresponding COVID-19-confirmed case numbers. Models were fitted to explain case numbers of each country's epidemic. Models using numerical date, contemporaneous and distributed lag CMR data were contrasted using Bayesian Information Criteria. Noticeable were negative correlations between CMR data and case incidence for prominent industrialised countries of Western Europe and the North Americas. Continent-wide examination found a negative correlation for all continents with the exception of South America. When modelling, CMR-expanded models proved superior to the model without CMR. The predictions made with the distributed lag model significantly outperformed all other models. The observed relationship between CMR data and case incidence, and its ability to enhance model quality and prediction suggests data related to community mobility could prove of use in future COVID-19 modelling.","Sulyok, M.; Walker, M.",Epidemiol Infect,18,16

Natural ZIKV infection elicits host responses capable of preventing subsequent re-infection, raising expectations for effective vaccination. Defining protective immune correlates will inform viral intervention strategies, particularly vaccine development. Non-human primate (NHP) species are susceptible to ZIKV and represent models for vaccine development. The protective efficacy of a human anti-ZIKV convalescent plasma pool (16/320-14) developed as a candidate reference material for a WHO International Standard was evaluated in macaques. Convalescent plasma administered to four cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) intra-peritoneally 24 hrs prior to sub-cutaneous challenge with 10(3) pfu ZIKV(PRVABC59) protected against detectable infection, with absence of detectable ZIKV RNA in blood and lymphoid tissues. Passively immunised anti-ZIKV immunoglobulin administered prior to time of challenge remained present only at very low levels 42 days post-challenge. Absence of de novo antibody responses in passively immunised macaques indicate sterilising immunity compared with naïve challenge controls that exhibited active ZIKV-specific IgM and IgG responses post-challenge.

However, whether higher dosing of steroids results in better outcomes has been debated. This was a retrospective observation of COVID-19 admissions between March 1, 2020, and March 10, 2021. Adult patients (≥18 years) who received more than 10 mg daily methylprednisolone equivalent dosing (MED) within the first 14 days were included. We excluded patients who were discharged or died within 7 days of admission. We compared the standard dose of steroids (<40 mg MED) versus the high dose of steroids (>40 mg MED). Inverse probability weighted regression adjustment (IPWRA) was used to examine whether higher dose steroids resulted in improved outcomes. The outcomes studied were in-hospital mortality, rate of acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring hemodialysis, invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), hospital-associated infections (HAI), and readmissions. Of the 1379 patients meeting study criteria, 506 received less than 40 mg of MED (median dose 30 mg MED) and 873 received more than or equal to 40 mg of MED (median dose 78 mg MED). Unadjusted in-hospital mortality was higher in patients who received high-dose corticosteroids (40.7% vs. 18.6%, p < 0.001).

Effective treatments of COVID-19 are extremely urgent. Objective: To analyze the efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma (CCP) on patients with COVID-19. Methods: All the relevant studies were searched from PubMed, EMBASE,Cochrane library, Scopus, Web of Science, CBM, CNKI, Wan fang, VIP, Medrxiv, Biorxiv, and SSRN on July 19, 2021. PICOS criteria were as follows: (P) the study interests were human subjects with the infection of COVID-19; (I) the intervention of interest was CCP; (C) comparator treatments contained placebo, sham therapy, and standard treatment; (O) the primary outcome was mortality rates by the novel coronavirus. The secondary outcomes included the incidence of serious adverse events, the rate of ICU admission and mechanical ventilation (MV); the length of hospital stay; the duration of MV and ICU stay; the antibody levels, inflammatory factor levels, and viral loads. (S) Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of CCP were included. Subanalysis, quality assessment, sensitive analysis, and publication bias were conducted by two reviewers independently. Results: Sixteen RCTs were included and enrolled a total of 16,296 participants in this meta-analysis. The pooled data showed that no significant difference was observed in reducing the rate of overall mortality between CCP treatment group and placebo group (OR 0.96; 95% CI 0.90 to 1.03; p = 0.30; I(2) = 6%). According to the results of subgroup analysis, severe or critical patients with CCP showed significant difference in reducing the 28-day mortality of compared with placebo (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.93, p = 0.02, I(2) = 0%). CCP groups have a significantly shorter duration of MV compared with the control group (weighted MD −1.00, 95% CI −1.86 to −0.14 d p = 0.02, I(2) = 0%). No significant difference was observed in the length of hospital stay, the duration of ICU, and the rate of ICU and MV. There is no conclusive evidence about the safety of CCP. Conclusion: Convalescent plasma can significantly reduce the 28-day mortality of severe or critical COVID-19 patients and the duration of MV. However, more evidence was needed to prove the safety of convalescent plasma.","Cao, Huiling; Ming, Li; Chen, Long; Zhu, Xingwang; Shi, Yuan",Front Med (Lausanne),18,30

However, the source of the location advantage of innovation hubs is still debated in the literature, with arguments ranging from localized knowledge spillovers to network effects. Thanks to an extensive data set of individual scientist career paths, we shed new light on the role of scientist location choices in determining the superior innovative performance of global cities. We analyze the career paths of around two million researchers over a decade across more than two thousand cities around the globe. First, we show that scientists active in global cities are more productive in terms of citation weighted publications. We then show that this superior performance is in part driven by highly prolific scientists moving and remaining preferentially in global cities, i.e., central cities in the international scientist mobility network. The overall picture that emerges is that global cities are better positioned to attract and retain prolific scientists than more peripheral cities.","Verginer, Luca; Riccaboni, Massimo",Res Policy,18,9

The COVID-19 pandemic has aggravated this situation, exacerbating the already habitual attacks on bats. Today there is an urgent need to address the human–bat conflict to develop conservation policies. Understanding peoples’ attitudes towards bats is a crucial part of this process. This study aimed to design the Bats Attitudes Standard Scale (BAtSS) and to analyze its properties. We developed a scale and analyzed its properties in a sample of 1639 Chileans. The final BAtSS consists of 34 questions on a five-point response scale. It has four factors (scientistic, positivistic, negativistic, and myths) and three subfactors (emotional negativistic, behavioral negativistic, and cognitive negativistic). The results showed that the scale was reliable and valid for measuring participants’ attitudes. Women and participants with a lower level of education were more negativistic and less positivistic. People with a higher level of education had a less mythological view of bats. We also analyzed the attitudes which would be more/less difficult to change. The BAtSS is an adequate tool and could help to understand and solve human–wildlife conflicts. ABSTRACT: Despite the benefits that bats offer the ecosystem, these animals are feared and attacked. The COVID-19 pandemic has aggravated this situation. Today there is an urgent need to address the human-bat conflict to develop conservation policies. Understanding peoples’ attitudes towards bats are critical for this process. This study aimed to design the Bats Attitudes Standard Scale (BAtSS) and to analyze its psychometric properties. We developed an initial version of the scale in which we established the content validity; we analyzed the items and structure in a pilot sample. In the next phase, we examined psychometric properties in a sample of 1639 Chileans. The final BAtSS consists of 34 Likert-type items configured in an oblique-hierarchical structure of four factors (scientistic, positivistic, negativistic, and myths) and three facets (emotional negativistic, behavioral negativistic, and cognitive negativistic). It presents adequate internal consistency, and the analysis of concurrent validity confirms the scale’s capacity to discriminate between groups. Women and participants with a lower level of education are more negativistic and less positivistic. People with a higher level of education have a less mythological view of bats. We also analyzed the items under the assumptions of item response theory (IRT).","Pérez, Beatriz; Álvarez, Boris; Boso, Alex; Lisón, Fulgencio",Animals (Basel),18,20

With concern for higher rates of marijuana use among those who vape nicotine, the presence of marijuana-related terms in store names was also assessed. A census of stores that were classified online as vape shops/stores or vaporizer stores were telephoned in April-May 2018 (n = 739) and July-September 2019 (n = 919) to verify whether vape products and other tobacco products (OTP) were sold. We computed the percent of stores that closed, opened, and started/stopped selling OTP. Multilevel models tested whether these events varied by store type and by neighborhood demographics. Within 16 months, 11.5% of 739 stores had closed and 29.8% of 919 stores at follow-up had opened. Closings were more likely among vape-only than vape + OTP stores (AOR = 2.51, 95% CI = 1.47,4.29); vape-only stores were less likely to open (AOR = 0.46, 95% CI = 0.34,0.62). Regardless of store type, the odds of a store opening increased as the proportion of non-Hispanic/Latino White residents in the census tract increased (AOR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.18,1.85). Overall, 2.0% of stores (vape-only and vape + OTP) had marijuana-related names at baseline and 3.5% at follow-up. The observed change (1.6% to 5.8%) was greatest in Oklahoma City, where the state legalized medical marijuana between baseline and follow-up. More stores were opening than closing in six U.S. metropolitan statistical areas before statewide sales restrictions on flavored tobacco and COVID-19. Uniform licensing is recommended to define vape shops and track their location and sales practices.","Barker, Dianne C.; Henriksen, Lisa; Voelker, David H.; Ali, Amna; Raskind, Ilana G.; Schleicher, Nina C.; Johnson, Trent O.; Berg, Carla J.",Prev Med Rep,18,29

Respirator material requirements are reduced by 75% compared to traditional designs and allow repeated cleaning or sterilization. The probability of virus particle inhalation is reduced using novel air filtration pathways, through square-waveform design to increase filter airflow. Air enters the mask from right and left side filters, while the area in front of the mouth is isolated. Clear epoxy is used for a transparent frame, allowing lip-reading, and mask edges contain a silicone seal preventing bypass of the filters. The mask is manufactured using silicone molds, eliminating electricity requirements making it economical and viable in developing countries. Computational fluid dynamics numerical studies and Fluent ANSYS software were used to simulate airflow through the filter to optimize filter air path geometry and validate mask design with realistic human requirements. The breathing cycle was represented as a transient function, and N95 filter specifications were selected as a porous medium. The novel design achieved 1.2 × 10(−3) kg s(−1), 20% higher than human requirements, with air streamlines velocity indicating local high speed, forcing and trapping virus particles against filter walls through centrifugal forces.","Alenezi, Hussain; Cam, Muhammet Emin; Edirisinghe, Mohan",Biodes Manuf,18,24

While human coronavirus infections had been historically associated with only mild respiratory symptoms similar to the common cold, three coronaviruses identified since 2003, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), cause life-threatening severe respiratory syndromes. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 has triggered a worldwide health emergency. Due to the lack of effective drugs and vaccination, rapid and reliable detection is of vital importance to control coronavirus epidemics/pandemics. AREA COVERED A literature search was performed in Pubmed covering the detections and diagnostics of SARS, MERS and SARS-CoV2. This review summarized the current knowledge of established and emerging methods for coronavirus detection. The characteristics of different diagnostic approaches were described, and the strengths and weaknesses of each method were analyzed and compared. In addition, future trends in the field of coronavirus detection were also discussed. EXPERT OPINION Nucleic acid-based RT-PCR is the current golden-standard of coronavirus detection, while immunoassays provide history of coronavirus infection besides diagnostic information. Integrated high-throughput system holds the great potential and is the trend of future detection and diagnosis of virus infection.","Diao, Mingkun; Lang, Lang; Feng, Juan; Li, Rongsong",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,18,1

We investigated the association between use of angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) and COVID‐19 hospitalization/death in a large nationwide population. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with hypertension, heart failure, diabetes, kidney disease, or ischaemic heart disease registered in the Swedish National Patient Registry until 1 February 2020 were included and followed until 31 May 2020. COVID‐19 cases were defined based on hospitalization/death for COVID‐19. Multivariable logistic and Cox regressions were fitted to investigate the association between ACEi/ARB and MRA and risk of hospitalization/death for COVID‐19 in the overall population, and of all‐cause mortality in COVID‐19 cases. We performed consistency analysis to quantify the impact of potential unmeasured confounding. Of 1 387 746 patients (60% receiving ACEi/ARB and 5.8% MRA), 7146 (0.51%) had incident hospitalization/death from COVID‐19. After adjustment for 45 variables, ACEi/ARB use was associated with a reduced risk of hospitalization/death for COVID‐19 (odds ratio 0.86, 95% confidence interval 0.81–0.91) in the overall population, and with reduced mortality in COVID‐19 cases (hazard ratio 0.89, 95% confidence interval 0.82–0.96). MRA use was not associated with risk of any outcome. Consistency analysis showed that unmeasured confounding would need to be large for there to be harmful signals associated with RAASi use. CONCLUSIONS: In a 1.4 million nationwide cohort, use of RAASi was not associated with increased risk of hospitalization for or death from COVID‐19.","Savarese, Gianluigi; Benson, Lina; Sundström, Johan; Lund, Lars H.",Eur J Heart Fail,18,3

Decades of international research shows that, across Europe, men have shorter life expectancies and higher mortality rates than women, and yet, women report higher morbidity. These gender-based health inequalities also appear to be evident within the pandemic and its aftermath. The article starts by providing an overview of the ‘gender health paradox’ and the biological, social, economic and political explanations for it. It then outlines the international estimates of gender-based inequalities in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality rates – where emerging data suggests that women are more likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19 but that men have a higher mortality rate. It then explores the longer term consequences for gender-based health inequalities of the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on the impacts of government policy responses and the emerging economic crisis, suggesting that this might lead to increased mortality amongst men and increased morbidity amongst women. The essay concludes by reflecting on the pathways shaping gender-based health inequalities in the COVID-19 pandemic and the responses needed to ensure that it does not exacerbate gender-based health inequalities into the future.","Bambra, Clare; Albani, Viviana; Franklin, Paula",Scand J Public Health,18,1

With the continuous spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) globally, it is of great significance to explore the impact of this disease on the clinical characteristics of lung cancer. Thus, we aimed to investigate whether the COVID-19 pandemic had any influence on the clinical characteristics and diagnosis of patients with lung cancer. We collected clinical and demographic data of patients who were newly diagnosed with lung cancer at our hospital between February 2019 and July 2020. Overall, 387 patients with lung cancer were divided into two groups for analysis: epidemic group (from February to July 2020) and pre-epidemic group (from February to July 2019). The source of diagnosis and clinical characteristics of the two groups were analysed. T-test and Mann-Whitney U were used for continuous variables, and Chi-squared or Fisher’s exact test for categorical variable. We found that during the epidemic period, 110 cases of lung cancer were incidentally diagnosed during COVID-19 screening, accounting for 47.6% of all newly diagnosed lung cancer cases at our hospital. The proportions of patients who were diagnosed based on symptoms and physical examination in the epidemic group were 34.2 and 18.2%, respectively, while that in the pre-epidemic group were 41.7 and 58.3%, respectively. There was significant difference in the source of diagnosis between the two groups. In a subgroup analysis of the epidemic group, the average tumour volume of the patients diagnosed with COVID-19 screening was significantly smaller than that of the patients diagnosed with symptoms and physical examination. In conclusion, the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the screening and clinical characteristics of lung cancer and require large-scale and longer-term observation.","Zhang, Yu; Li, Jie; Li, Zhi-Ke; Yang, Xiyue; Bai, Jie; Liu, Lihua; Dai, Tangzhi; Feng, Gang; Li, Qiu; Du, Xiaobo",Front Oncol,18,28

The present study evaluated parameters of importance for spray drying of siRNA-loaded poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs) into nanocomposite microparticles intended for inhalation. The spray drying process was optimised using a statistical design of experiment and by evaluating powder characteristics upon systematic variation of the formulation parameters. Concentration, carbohydrate excipient (trehalose, lactose and mannitol) and the ratio of NP to excipient were varied to monitor the effects on moisture content, particle morphology, particle size and powder yield. The identified optimum conditions were applied for spray drying of siRNA-loaded nanocomposite microparticles, resulting in a product with a low water content (0.78% w/w) and an aerodynamic particle diameter considered suitable for inhalation. The use of mannitol in the formulation allowed a significantly lower moisture content than trehalose and lactose. The inclusion of 50% (w/w) or higher amounts of NPs resulted in a marked change in the surface morphology of the spray-dried particles. Importantly, the integrity and biological activity of the siRNA were preserved during the spray drying process. In conclusion, the present results show that spray drying is a suitable technique for producing nanocomposite microparticles comprising siRNA-containing PLGA NPs for potential use in inhalation therapy.","Jensen, Ditte Marie Krohn; Cun, Dongmei; Maltesen, Morten Jonas; Frokjaer, Sven; Nielsen, Hanne Mørck; Foged, Camilla",J Control Release,18,16

The case of Greece, over the period 2009–2018, is taken as an example for our empirical investigation. The empirical analysis uses annual household panel data for the construction of 330 cohorts. The specification of cohorts is based on the date of birth, education level and geographical location of the head of the household. The econometric analysis is carried out using static and dynamic specifications and a quantile regression model. The results show that residential demand for electricity is price and income inelastic, both in the short and the long run. Electricity and heating oil appear to be complementary energy sources, while the household size and the education level are important determinants of residential demand for electricity. Income status has a marginal effect on demand for electricity, and the impact of urbanisation is insignificant. The quantile regression results show that, as the level of electricity use increases, demand for electricity becomes less income responsive and more price responsive. Our results show that a mix of structural energy measures along with economic policies could result in a decrease in electricity use and improve energy efficiency.","Kostakis, Ioannis; Lolos, Sarantis",Energy Ecol Environ,18,21

Here we describe and compare the first-wave mitigation strategies and epidemiology of five Asia-Pacific countries that responded rapidly to the epidemic. METHODS: From January to April 2020, mitigation measures and epidemiological data for Singapore, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong were screened from official local government websites and a review of investigational studies was conducted. Daily case reports and mitigation measures information were extracted. Epidemiological estimates were calculated and compared between countries. RESULTS: All five countries combined measures, focusing on contact tracing, testing, isolation efforts and healthcare management. Epidemiological data varied temporally and geographically: incubation period ranged 3.9–7.1 days, effective reproduction number at time t (Rt) ranged 0.48–1.5, with intensive care admissions 1–3% of hospitalised patients, and case fatality rates were 0.1–3%. Extrinsic estimates to the virus were lower than global estimates.

Its pathogenesis is not fully elucidated, but the two main theories foresee a direct role of ACE2 receptor and a hyperimmune response, which may also lead to isolated presentation of COVID-19-mediated myocarditis. The frequency and prognostic impact of COVID-19-mediated myocarditis is unknown. This review aims to summarise current evidence on this topic. We performed a systematic review of MEDLINE and Cochrane Library (1/12/19–30/09/20). We also searched clinicaltrials.gov for unpublished studies testing therapies with potential implication for COVID-19-mediated cardiovascular complication. Eligible studies had laboratory confirmed COVID-19 and a clinical and/or histological diagnosis of myocarditis by ESC or WHO/ISFC criteria. Reports of 38 cases were included (26 male patients, 24 aged < 50 years). The first histologically proven case was a virus-negative lymphocytic myocarditis; however, biopsy evidence of myocarditis secondary to SARS-CoV-2 cardiotropism has been recently demonstrated. Histological data was found in 12 cases (8 EMB and 4 autopsies) and CMR was the main imaging modality to confirm a diagnosis of myocarditis (25 patients). There was a substantial variability in biventricular systolic function during the acute episode and in therapeutic regimen used. Five patients died in hospital. Cause-effect relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and myocarditis is difficult to demonstrate. However, current evidence demonstrates myocardial inflammation with or without direct cardiomyocyte damage, suggesting different pathophysiology mechanisms responsible of COVID-mediated myocarditis. Established clinical approaches should be pursued until future evidence support different actions. Large multicentre registries are advisable to elucidate further.

Alternaria alternata is an ascomycete fungus that causes leaf spot diseases on various crop plants. In this study, we identified a novel ssRNA mycovirus infecting an A. alternata f. sp. mali strain isolated from an apple orchard in China. Sequence analyses revealed that this virus is related to hypoviruses, in particular to Wuhan insect virus 14, an unclassified hypovirus identified from insect meta-transcriptomics, as well as other hypoviruses belonging to the genus Hypovirus, and therefore this virus is designed as Alternaria alternata hypovirus 1 (AaHV1). The genome of AaHV1 contains a single large open-reading frame encoding a putative polyprotein (∼479 kDa) with a cysteine proteinase-like and replication-associated domains. Curing AaHV1 from the fungal host strain indicated that the virus is responsible for the slow growth and reduced virulence of the host. AaHV1 defective RNA (D-RNA) with internal deletions emerging during fungal subcultures but the presence of D-RNA does not affect AaHV1 accumulation and pathogenicities. Moreover, AaHV1 could replicate and confer hypovirulence in Botryosphaeria dothidea, a fungal pathogen of apple white rot disease. This finding could facilitate better understanding of A. alternata pathogenicity and is relevant for development of biocontrol methods of fungal diseases.","Li, Huan; Bian, Ruiling; Liu, Qian; Yang, Liu; Pang, Tianxing; Salaipeth, Lakha; Andika, Ida Bagus; Kondo, Hideki; Sun, Liying",Front Microbiol,18,16

In theory, sense-specific measurement of viral RNAs may be achieved by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays which utilize primers of defined polarity during the RT step. However, in practice, it has been shown that such assays are prone to artifacts, such as non-specific priming, which drastically diminish their reliability. Using murine coronavirus MHV-4 as a model, we describe and validate several modifications of the RT-PCR procedure which eliminate these artifacts. Key RT-PCR parameters which were optimized include the design of tagged primers, DNase treatment of in vitro transcribed RNA standards, specification of temperature differences between RT and PCR annealing steps, and use of competitive RNA templates for quantitative assays. The assays described may be used to determine the sense and abundance of any viral or host RNA of interest in complex biological specimens.","Schoenike, Barry; Franta, Amy K.; Fleming, John O.",J Virol Methods,18,16

The current COVID-19 pandemic has led to substantial changes in many fields of medicine, specifically in the forensic discipline. Medicolegal activities related to conducting autopsies have been largely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Postmortem examinations are generally discouraged by government regulations due to the risk of spreading the disease further through the handling and dissection of bodies from patients who succumbed to COVID-19 infection. There is a paucity of data regarding the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in bodies, as well as concerning the reliability of swabbing methods in human remains. On the other hand, the autopsy is an essential tool to provide necessary information about the pathophysiology of the disease that presents useful clinical and epidemiological insights. On this basis, we aim to address issues concerning general medical examiner/coroner organization, comparing the Italian and American systems. We also discuss the pivotal roles of forensic pathologists in informing infectious disease surveillance. Finally, we focus on the impact of COVID-19 emergency on medicolegal practices in Italy and the United States, as well as the responses of the forensic scientific community to the emerging concerns related to the pandemic.

Due to the rapidly imposed lockdown and its relatively closed community, this town was seen as an ideal model to investigate the infection fatality rate (IFR). Here, a 7-day seroepidemiological observational study was performed to collect information and biomaterials from a random, household-based study population. The number of infections was determined by IgG analyses and PCR testing. We found that of the 919 individuals with evaluable infection status, 15.5% (95% CI:[12.3%; 19.0%]) were infected. This is a fivefold higher rate than the reported cases for this community (3.1%). 22.2% of all infected individuals were asymptomatic. The estimated IFR was 0.36% (95% CI:[0.29%; 0.45%]) for the community and 0.35% [0.28%; 0.45%] when age-standardized to the population of the community. Participation in carnival increased both infection rate (21.3% versus 9.5%, p < 0.001) and number of symptoms (estimated relative mean increase 1.6, p = 0.007). While the infection rate here is not representative for Germany, the IFR is useful to estimate the consequences of the pandemic in places with similar healthcare systems and population characteristics.

Credible and non-credible sources may impact public reactions to the virus. The purpose of this study is to assess those reactions of women located in or near Kansas. A survey was conducted in July 2020 with questions on knowledge of COVID-19, attitudes and behaviors towards COVID-19, and primary sources of information. 305 survey respondents met criteria for further analysis, and descriptive statistical analyses were applied. Participants were generally knowledgeable of the pandemic, with a mean knowledge score of 11.40 out of 13 (SD 1.3). The attitude statement with the highest rate of agreement was that “social distancing is an effective way of controlling COVID-19 spread” (n = 265, 86.9%) and that with the highest rate of disagreement was, “I am not worried about my friends’ and family members health” (n = 253, 83.0%). The most-implemented behaviors as indicated by participants were avoiding contact with sick individuals and washing hands with soap and water often (n = 294, 96.4%), and the least implemented was avoiding meat consumption (n = 257, 84.3%). Finally, most participants indicated that health officials were their primary source of information (n = 215, 70.5%). Participants of this survey had fairly good knowledge of the virus. Attitudes of participants as a whole may be described as cautious without being overly fearful. Reported behaviors also align well with current public health recommendations.

We previously identified that prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), released following RSV infection of primary human airway epithelial cells or pneumonia virus of mice (PVM) infection of neonatal mice, elicits pro- or antiviral innate immune responses as a consequence of D-type prostanoid receptor 2 (DP2) or DP1 activation, respectively. Here, we sought to determine whether treatment with the DP1 agonist BW245c decreases the severity of bronchiolitis in PVM-infected neonatal mice. Consistent with previous findings, BW245c treatment increased IFN-λ production and decreased viral load in week 1 of the infection. However, unexpectedly, BW245c treatment increased mortality in week 2 of the infection. This increased morbidity was associated with viral spread to the parenchyma, an increased cellular infiltrate of TNF-α-producing cells (neutrophils, monocytes, and CD4(+) T cells), and the heightened production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β. These phenotypes, as well as the increased mortality, were significantly attenuated following the administration of anti-TNF-α to PVM-infected, BW245c-treated mice. In summary, pharmacological activation of the DP1 receptor in PVM-infected neonatal mice boosts antiviral innate and adaptive immunity, however, this is ultimately detrimental, as a consequence of increased TNF-α-induced morbidity and mortality.","Ullah, Md Ashik; Rittchen, Sonja; Li, Jia; Hasnain, Sumaira Z.; Phipps, Simon",Mucosal Immunol,18,16

Live probiotic bacteria improve the composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota, leading to a reduction in pathogen colonization. However, it remains largely unknown how probiotics regulate the host’s immunologic responses and protect the host from parasitic infection. In this study, we addressed whether Bacillales were effective against Haemonchus contortus, a parasitic nematode that infects small ruminants worldwide. Using 16S rRNA sequencing, we found that Bacillales were largely depleted in the abomasal microbiota of sheep infected with H. contortus. We constructed a recombinant Bacillus subtilis named rBS(CotB-HcG) that express the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase of H. contortus (HcGAPDH) on its spore surface using the Bacillus subtilis spore coat protein B (CotB) as a carrier. Mice receiving rBS(CotB-HcG) orally showed strong Th1-dominated immune responses. More importantly, sheep administered BS(CotB-HcG) per os showed increasing proliferation of the peripheral blood mononucleates, elevated anti-HcGAPDH IgG in sera, and higher anti-HcGAPDH sIgA in the intestinal mucus than the control sheep. The average weight gain of H. contortus-infected sheep treated with rBS(CotB-HcG) (Hc+rBS(CotB-HcG)) was 48.73% greater than that of unvaccinated sheep. Furthermore, these Hc+rBS(CotB-HcG) sheep had fewer eggs per gram of feces by 84.1% and adult worms by 71.5%. They also demonstrated greatly lessened abomasal damage by H. contortus with an abundance of probiotic species in the abomasal microbiota. Collectively, our data unequivocally demonstrate the protective roles of CotB-HcGAPDH-expressing B. subtilis spores in against H. contortus infection and showed great potential of using probiotic-based strategy in controlling parasitic nematodes of socioeconomic importance in general. IMPORTANCE Initial analyses of the abomasal microbiota of sheep using 16S rRNA sequencing suggested that probiotic bacteria played a protective role in against H. contortus infection. A recombinant Bacillus subtilis expressing a fusion protein CotB-HcGAPDH on its spore’s surface induced strong Th1 immune response in a murine model. The same probiotic recombinant, upon only one oral application, protected sheep against H. contortus infection by reducing egg shedding and decreasing adult worm loads of the parasite and increasing body weight gain of infected sheep. Both Th1 and Th2 immune responses were evident in these immunized sheep.","Yang, Yi; Zhang, Guiheng; Wu, Jie; Chen, Xueqiu; Tong, Danni; Yang, Yimin; Shi, Hengzhi; Yao, Chaoqun; Zhuang, Lenan; Wang, Jianbin; Du, Aifang",mSystems,18,29

It occurs when an injured myocardial wall ruptures and is contained by overlying adherent pericardium or scar tissue, most commonly it develops in patients with late presentation of MI and delayed revascularization. CASE SUMMARY: A 64-year-old man presented to the emergency department with intermittent central chest pain radiating to back and neck and increasing on deep inspiration, which was considered to be of musculoskeletal origin for a week, but worsened despite medications. Electrocardiography showed features of ST-elevation MI; a circumflex artery occlusion was found on coronary angiogram and angioplasty was performed. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) revealed features of healed lateral wall rupture with adherent parietal pericardium and the patient was managed conservatively. Two months later the patient returned with severe chest pain; echocardiogram and cardiac computed tomography showed significant interval progression of the pseudoaneurysm. Aneurysmectomy was performed, after which the patient recovered and had none of the previous symptoms since. Follow-up CMR study revealed improvement of LV systolic function. DISCUSSION: A rare case of post-infarction LV pseudoaneurysm was reported. Multimodality imaging helped to detect and to differentiate this complication from the true aneurysm and to follow it up and plan the treatment. Conservative treatment was not effective in this case as the pseudoaneurysm progressed; aneurysmectomy helped to improve LV systolic function.","Banisauskaite, Audra; Velavan, Periaswamy; Hasleton, Jonathan; Mediratta, Neeraj; Arzanauskaite, Monika; Binukrishnan, Sukumaran",Eur Heart J Case Rep,18,18

This virus emerged in late December 2019 in Wuhan city, Hubei, China. The grim fact of COVID-19 is, it is highly contagious in nature, therefore, spreads rapidly all over the world and causes severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Responding to the severity of COVID-19 research community directs the attention to the analysis of COVID-19, to diminish its antagonistic impact towards society. Numerous studies claim that the subcontinent, i.e., Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan, could remain in the worst affected region by the COVID-19. In order to prevent the spread of COVID-19, it is important to predict the trend of COVID-19 beforehand the planning of effective control strategies. Fundamentally, the idea is to dependably estimate the reproduction number to judge the spread rate of COVID-19 in a particular region. Consequently, this paper uses publicly available epidemiological data of Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan to estimate the reproduction numbers. More specifically, we use various models (for example, susceptible infection recovery (SIR), exponential growth (EG), sequential Bayesian (SB), maximum likelihood (ML) and time dependent (TD)) to estimate the reproduction numbers and observe the model fitness in the corresponding data set. Experimental results show that the reproduction numbers produced by these models are greater than 1.2 (approximately) indicates that COVID-19 is gradually spreading in the subcontinent.","Singh, Bikash Chandra; Alom, Zulfikar; Hu, Haibo; Rahman, Mohammad Muntasir; Baowaly, Mrinal Kanti; Aung, Zeyar; Azim, Mohammad Abdul; Moni, Mohammad Ali",J Pers Med,18,26

Several clinical trials, both Allopathy and AYUSH medicines have been registered in the Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI). We aimed to characterize and extract relevant data registered under CTRI for COVID-19. Materials and MethodsA cross-sectional analysis was performed of clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19 that were registered in the Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI) from 1st March 2020 to 22nd June 2020. Relevant trial records were downloaded, deduplicated, and independently analyzed by three reviewers. Main outcomesTrial intervention, design, sponsorship, phase of the trial, and indicated outcomes. Results233 COVID-19 clinical trials, was registered from India in CTRI. Out of these, 146 were Interventional trials, 84 Observational trials, and three Post-marketing surveillance. Questionnaire and survey-based intervention occupy a significant portion. Randomized control trials are large in number 37.8% than non-randomized. 20% of the trials were recruiting patients, and the Research institution (34%) sponsored more than half of the trials. Global trials are minimal, occupying 3% of total trials and Indian trials were 97%. In most of the trials, the interventional agent is either multiple drug combinations or compound drug formulations compared to single drug administration. Among the trials, 46 Allopathic interventions, 41 Ayurveda interventions, 14 Homeopathy interventions, one in Unani, and 2 in yoga and Naturopathy.

Even among the MAbs that have been shown to recognize the same antigenic site, IgG 2a MAbs enhanced FIPV infection strongly, whereas IgG 1 MAbs did not. These IgG 2a MAbs enhanced the infection even when macrophages pretreated with the MAb were washed and then inoculated with the virus. Immunofluorescence flow cytometric analysis of the macrophages treated with each of the MAbs showed that the IgG 2a MAbs but not the IgG 1 MAbs bound to feline alveolar macrophages. Treatment of the IgG 2a MAb with protein A decreased the binding to the macrophages and, in parallel, diminished the ADE activity. Although no infection was observed by inoculation of FIPV to human monocyte cell line U937 cells, FIPV complexed with either the IgG 2a MAb or the IgG 1 MAb caused infection in U937 cells which are shown to express Fc gamma receptor (Fc γ R) I and II that can bind mouse IgG 2a and IgG 1, respectively. These results suggest that the enhancing activity of MAb is closely correlated with IgG subclass and that the correlation is involved in binding of MAb to Fc γ R on feline macrophage.","Hohdatsu, T.; Tokunaga, J.; Koyama, H.",Arch Virol,18,29

The virus started from a single organism and is escalating at a rate of 3% to 5% daily and seems to be a never ending process. Understanding the basic dynamics and presenting new predictions models for evaluating the potential effect of the virus is highly crucial. In present work, an evolutionary data analytics method called as Genetic programming (GP) is used to mathematically model the potential effect of coronavirus in 15 most affected countries of the world. Two datasets namely confirmed cases (CC) and death cases (DC) were taken into consideration to estimate, how transmission varied in these countries between January 2020 and May 2020. Further, a percentage rise in the number of daily cases is also shown till 8 June 2020 and it is expected that Brazil will have the maximum rise in CC and USA have the most DC. Also, prediction of number of new CC and DC cases for every one million people in each of these countries is presented. The proposed model predicted that the transmission of COVID-19 in China is declining since late March 2020; in Singapore, France, Italy, Germany and Spain the curve has stagnated; in case of Canada, South Africa, Iran and Turkey the number of cases are rising slowly; whereas for USA, UK, Brazil, Russia and Mexico the rate of increase is very high and control measures need to be taken to stop the chains of transmission. Apart from that, the proposed prediction models are simple mathematical equations and future predictions can be drawn from these general equations. From the experimental results and statistical validation, it can be said that the proposed models use simple linkage functions and provide highly reliable results for time series prediction of COVID-19 in these countries.","Salgotra, Rohit; Gandomi, Mostafa; Gandomi, Amir H.",Chaos Solitons Fractals,18,20

In this study, we have reported our experience of contact tracing and risk categorization in a tertiary care teaching hospital in Eastern India. Methodology: This is a secondary data analysis of routine data collected from 19th March to 31st August 2020 during the process of contact tracing in a tertiary care teaching hospital in India amongst 3411 health care workers (HCWs). HCWs exposed to COVID-19 infections were categorized as per the risk stratification guidelines and the high risk cases were quarantined for 14 days and tested on 7th day of last contact. The low risk contacts were encouraged to closely monitor their symptoms and allowed to continue work. Results: Out of 3411 contacts 890 (26.1%) were high risk contacts and 2521 (73.9%) were low risk contacts. The test positivity rate of high risk contact was 3.82% and for low risk contact was 1.9%. Number of high risk contacts was more in Non-COVID area (15.84) as compared to COVID area (0.27); p value < 0.001), amongst IPD patients (6.61) as compared to staff (4.02) and OPD (0.22) ; p value = 0.009 and when clustering of cases present (14.35) as compared to isolated cases (8.21); p value < 0.001 Conclusion: The case identification, risk stratification and contact tracing have helped in reducing the number of contacts with due course of time, so preventing the depletion of human resources for continuing health care.

The mass population mobility in China during the Spring Festival has been considered a driver to the transmission of COVID-19, but it still needs more empirical discussion. METHODS: Based on the panel data from Hubei, China between January 6th and February 6th, 2020, a random effects model was used to estimate the impact of population mobility on the transmission of COVID-19. Stata version 12.0 was used, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The COVID-19 was more likely to be confirmed within 11–12 days after people moved from Wuhan to 16 other prefecture-level cities in Hubei Province, which suggests a period of 11–12 days from contact to being confirmed. The daily confirmed cases and daily increment in incidence in 16 prefecture-level cities show obvious declines 9–12 days post adaptation of city lockdown at the local level. CONCLUSION: Population mobility is found to be a driver to the rapid transmission of COVID-19, and the lockdown intervention in local prefecture-level cities of Hubei Province has been an effective strategy to block the COVID-19 epidemic.","Jiang, Junfeng; Luo, Lisha",Glob Health Res Policy,18,24

Governments in West Africa have struggled to address the problems within their higher education systems for health professionals, and it is now generally acknowledged that private institutions can play a crucial role in revitalizing the region’s outdated universities. However, the rapid expansion of private schools raises concerns about the quality of education and adequacy of regulatory mechanisms. The USAID-funded Mali HRH Strengthening Activity, led by IntraHealth International, assisted Mali’s Ministry of Health and Social Development to deliver targeted HRH interventions to improve the quality of education in private universities, better manage available health workers, and initiate a decentralized strategy for health worker recruitment and motivation. CASE PRESENTATION: In 2018, the HRH activity leveraged the West African Health Organization (WAHO)’s accreditation system to support 10 private nursing schools to introduce WAHO’s regionally accepted, competency-based curriculum in reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health. The project undertook a 10-step process to work alongside private nursing and midwifery schools to assess their current status against WAHO regional standards, implement action plans to address identified gaps, and support the institutions toward accreditation. As a result, eight schools in Mali are now accredited compared to only three at project inception. CONCLUSIONS: This case study underscores the importance of private school accreditation in Mali to improve the quality of health worker training through a standardized local curriculum. By supporting existing regulatory bodies that oversee accreditation, local capacity for initial accreditation of private nursing schools has been increased. Engaging universities in a partnership that shows the benefits of accreditation while maintaining a focus on the need to protect communities is critical to success. If the global community is to meet the WHO’s predicted health worker shortfall, then private education providers will need to be part of the solution. Robust and engaging health worker education accreditation systems are an essential part of that future.","Touré, Cheick Oumar; Bijou, Sujata; Joiner, Melanie; Brown, Andrew; Tessougué, Jeanne; Maiga, Hamada; Dicko, Fatoumata; Keïta, Abdel Kader",Hum Resour Health,18,1

However, beyond evidence of initial policy effects, little is understood in the scholarly literature about whether the ACA Medicaid expansion affected longer-lasting changes in CHC patient insurance mix. This study’s objective was to examine whether the ACA Medicaid expansion was associated with lasting increases in the annual percentage of adult CHC patients covered by Medicaid and decreases in the annual percentage of uninsured adult CHC patients at expansion-state CHCs, compared to non-expansion-state CHCs. This observational study examined 5353 CHC-year observations from 2012 to 2018 using Uniform Data System data and other national data sources. Using a 2-way fixed-effects multivariable regression approach and marginal analysis, intermediate-term policy effects of the Medicaid expansion on annual CHC patient coverage outcomes were estimated. By 5-years post-expansion, the Medicaid expansion was associated with an overall average increase of 11.7 percentage points in the percentage of adult patients with Medicaid coverage at expansion-state CHCs, compared to non-expansion-state CHCs. Among expansion-state CHCs, 39.8% of adult patients were predicted to have Medicaid coverage 5-years post-expansion, compared to 19.0% of non-expansion-state adult CHC patients. A state’s decision to expand Medicaid was similarly associated with decreases in the annual percentage of uninsured adult CHC patients. Primary care operations at CHCs critically depend on patient Medicaid revenue. These findings suggest the ACA Medicaid expansion may provide longer-term financial security for expansion-state CHCs, which maintain increases in Medicaid-covered adult patients even 5-years post-expansion. However, these financial securities may be jeopardized should the ACA be ruled unconstitutional in 2021, a year after CHCs experienced new uncertainties caused by COVID-19.","Goldstein, Evan V.",Inquiry,18,16

The program focussed on the identification of ester-based benzodiazepine derivatives that are rapidly broken down by esterases. Remimazolam was identified as one of the lead compounds. The project at Glaxo was shelved for strategic reasons at the late lead optimization stage. Via the GSK ventures initiative, the program was acquired by the small biotechnology company, TheraSci, and, through successive acquisitions, developed as the besylate salt at CeNeS and PAION. The development of remimazolam besylate has been slow by industry standards, primarily because of the resource limitations of these small companies. It has, however, recently been approved for anesthesia in Japan and South Korea, procedural sedation in the United States, China, and Europe, and for compassionate use in intensive care unit sedation in Belgium. A second development program of remimazolam was later initiated in China, using a slightly different salt form, remimazolam tosylate. This salt form of the compound has also recently been approved for procedural sedation in China. Remimazolam has the pharmacological profile of a classical benzodiazepine, such as midazolam, but is differentiated from other intravenous benzodiazepines by its rapid conversion to an inactive metabolite resulting in a short onset/offset profile. It is differentiated from other intravenous hypnotic agents, such as propofol, by its low liability for cardiovascular depression, respiratory depression, and injection pain. The benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil can reverse the effects of remimazolam in case of adverse events and further shorten recovery times. The aim of this review is to provide an analysis of, and perspective on, published non-clinical and clinical information on 1) the pharmacology, metabolism, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic profile of remimazolam, 2) the profile of remimazolam compared with established agents, 3) gaps in the current understanding of remimazolam, 4) the compound’s discovery and development process and 5) likely future developments in the clinical use of remimazolam.","Kilpatrick, Gavin J.",Front Pharmacol,18,31

Most guidelines rely on Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores to maximize lives saved, but states have adopted different stances on whether to maximize long-term outcomes (life-years saved) by accounting for patient comorbidities. METHODS: We compared 4 representative state guidelines with varying approaches to comorbidities and analyzed how CSC prioritization correlates with clinical outcomes. We included 27 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to ICUs at Brigham and Women’s Hospital from March 12 to April 3, 2020. We compared prioritization algorithms from New York, which assigns priority based on SOFA alone; Maryland, which uses SOFA plus severe comorbidities; Pennsylvania, which uses SOFA plus major and severe comorbidities; and Colorado, which uses SOFA plus a modified Charlson comorbidity index. RESULTS: In pairwise comparisons across all possible pairs, we found that state guidelines frequently resulted in tie-breakers based on age or lottery: New York 100% of the time (100% resolved by lottery), Pennsylvania 86% of the time (18% by lottery), Maryland 93% of the time (35% by lottery), and Colorado: 32% of the time (10% by lottery). The prioritization algorithm with the strongest correlation with 14-day outcomes was Colorado (r(s) = −0.483. p = 0.011) followed by Maryland (r(s) = −0.394, p =0.042), Pennsylvania (r(s) = −0.382, p = 0.049), and New York (r(s) = 0). An alternative model using raw SOFA scores alone was moderately correlated with outcomes (r(s) = −0.448, p = 0.019). CONCLUSIONS: State guidelines for scarce resource allocation frequently resulted in identical priority scores, requiring tie-breakers based on age or lottery. These findings suggest that state CSC guidelines should be further assessed empirically to understand whether they meet their goals.","Jezmir, Julia L.; Bharadwaj, Maheetha; Kishore, Sandeep P.; Winkler, Marisa; Diephuis, Bradford; Kim, Edy Y.; Feldman, William B.",medRxiv,18,7

These multipotent MSCs can be found in nearly all tissues but mostly located in perivascular niches, playing a significant role in tissue repair and regeneration. Additionally, MSCs interact with immune cells both in innate and adaptive immune systems, modulating immune responses and enabling immunosuppression and tolerance induction. Understanding the biology of MSCs and their roles in clinical treatment is crucial for developing MSC-based cellular therapy for a variety of pathological conditions.

Markers of infection included histology, immunohistochemistry, virus quantification and virus serology. All BALE mice developed severe disseminated disease with high mortality due to encephalitis and hepatitis. Peak MHV titers appeared in brain, liver, spleen and intestine on days 3 or 5. Age at inoculation did not influence virus titers in brain, spleen or intestine, but virus titers in liver were inversely proportional to age at inoculation. In 6-wk-old BALE mice, virus was cleared from spleen, intestine and liver by day 30 and from brain by day 60. In intestine, MHV was localized to lymphoid tissue, without fecal excretion. SJL mice of all ages developed remarkably milder disease with low mortality occurring only among mice inoculated at 1 wk of age. SJL mice inoculated at 1 wk had disseminated infection at day 3, but lesions and antigen were cleared from most organs by day 5. Mice inoculated at 3 and 6 wk of age had minimal or no involvement of peripheral organs, and mice inoculated at 12 wk of age had infections restricted to the nose. At day 5, MHV titers in brain, liver, spleen and intestine were significantly lower or undetectable in SJL mice of all ages compared to age-matched BALB mice. In 6-wk-old mice, MHV was cleared from all organs by day 10.

However, to mitigate any potential adverse effects of reduced antenatal visits, intelligent and smart use of evolving telemedicine capabilities can provide the continuum of care despite overwhelming burden due to pandemic. A collaborative work-model involving health workers in the community and the regional levels of health centres also has the potential to prevent the catastrophic collapse of obstetric care services during any pandemic like COVID-19.","Zangmo, Rinchen; Kumari, Archana; Garg, Deepali; Sharma, K.

Research regarding the implementation of virtual teaching environments and standardized patients for simulation remains limited. Here, educators’ outcomes were evaluated following a transition from in-person teaching with “real” patients, to a standardized patient-based simulation in pre-clerkship psychiatric clinical skills teaching for medical students. METHODS: The Integrated Clinical Experiences course at the University of Toronto is a pre-clerkship clinical skills curriculum for second-year medical students. Four psychiatric clinical skills sessions were transitioned from in-person teaching to virtual teaching environments with standardized patient-based simulation. Educators (tutors) were assigned to teach groups of four to seven medical students, with a total of 45 groups. Tutors were then asked to complete an online questionnaire, and data was analyzed by quantitative and qualitative means. RESULTS: Of 30 tutors, 21 (75.0%) had previously taught the course for an average of 6.52 ± 6.85 years. Twenty-four of 30 (80%) tutors described their ease of virtual teaching as “extremely easy” or “moderately easy”. Twenty-three of 30 (76.6%) were “extremely satisfied” or “moderately satisfied” with standardized patient-based simulation. Various advantages and disadvantages of the virtual teaching environment with standardized patient-based simulation were identified. CONCLUSIONS: The transition to a virtual teaching environment utilizing standardized patients in a pre-clerkship simulation-based curriculum did not result in significant challenges that would limit educators’ use of these teaching tools. Implementation of virtual teaching environments with standardized patients may thus serve to address challenges related to COVID-19 and resource limitations.","Patel, Mitesh; Hui, Jeanette; Ho, Certina; Mak, Christy Kei; Simpson, Alexander; Sockalingam, Sanjeev",Acad Psychiatry,18,16

Urologists in training who are already known to have burnout, are in the front line to face this disease. The aim of our study was to assess the psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on young French urologists in training. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A self-administered anonymous questionnaire evaluating the pandemic added stress, and its negative impact on work and training quality, was e-mailed to the members of the French Association of Urologists in Training (AFUF). The association includes all French junior and senior residents. The survey lasted 3 days. Multivariable analyses using logistic regression was performed to identify the predictive factors. RESULTS: Two hundred and seventy-five (55.5%) of the 495 AFUF members responded to the questionnaire. More than 90% of responders felt more stressed by the pandemic. Fellows and senior residents were more likely to feel that the crisis had an important impact on their work quality (OR = 1.76, IC95 = [1.01–3.13]), even more when COVID 19 patients were present in their department (OR = 2.31, IC95 = [1.20–4.65]). Past medical history of respiratory disease (OR = 2.57, IC95 = [1.31–5.98]) and taking in charge COVID19 patients (OR = 1.85, IC95 = [0.98–3.59]) were additional risk factors. CONCLUSION: COVID19 pandemic has a negative impact on young French urologists in training and on their work and training quality.

The present study evaluated the degree to which daytime cognitive dysfunction may be related to worsening sleep. METHODS: Data from adults aged 18 and older in the 2020 Coronavirus and Impact on Dreams (CovID) study were used. Individuals were asked “how would you rate your sleep quality overall” and answered with “very good, fairly good, fairly bad, or very bad.” Subjects were asked if it takes “30 minutes or more to fall asleep” and answered with how frequently that happened. In addition, participants were asked how often they wake up during the night. Participants were then asked how much they think their sleep problems have contributed to daytime functioning and answered on a scale of 0 to 5, from “not at all” to “very much,” respectively. RESULTS: 46% of the sample did not report problems with daytime cognitive function, while 33%, 12%, and 9% reported mild, moderate, and severe problems, respectively. Those who reported that they have kept a regular schedule during the pandemic were 83% less likely to report greater daytime cognitive dysfunction (95%CI:0.08,0.37, p<0.0005). Those who indicated that overall their sleep worsened or improved did not demonstrate a difference in likelihood of daytime cognitive problems. Regarding specific sleep experiences, those who reported more problems falling asleep due to the pandemic were 8.2 times more likely to report daytime cognitive dysfunction (95%CI:3.53,19.07, p<0.0005) and those who reported more problems with morning awakenings were 5.7 times more likely (95%CI:2.10,15.56, p<0.001). Those who reported that they were sleepier as a result of the pandemic were 9.3 times as likely to report daytime cognitive dysfunction (95%CI:3.53,24.46, p<0.0005) and those who reported taking more naps were 4.4 times more likely (95%CI:1.90,10.40, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: In general, people who reported increased sleepiness, a less regular schedule, more insomnia, and more napping were more likely to experience daytime cognitive dysfunction during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), which causes diarrhea in swine of all ages, is a worldwide-distributed alphacoronavirus with economic importance. Here, we screened PEDV RNA modification enzymes involved in regulating antiviral response. Whereas the PEDV nsp13 barely regulates type I IFN, inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-a) and MHCII, nsp16 and nsp14 (to a lesser extent) down-regulate these antiviral effectors. Importantly, we found nsp16 KDKE tetrad appears to play a key role in interferon inhibition by mutating the D129 catalytic residue. Mechanistically, nsp16 down-regulates the activities of RIG-I and MDA5 mediated IFN-β and ISRE. In turn, the mRNA levels of IFIT family members (IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3) was inhibited in cells overexpressing nsp16. In addition, nsp10 enhanced the inhibitory effect of nsp16 on IFN-β. Altogether these results indicate PEDV nsp16 negatively regulates innate immunity to promote viral proliferation.

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been associated with the occurrence since summer 2020 of several viral variants that overlapped or succeeded each other in time. Those of current concern harbor mutations within the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) that may be associated with viral escape to immune responses. In our geographical area a viral variant we named Marseille-4 harbors a S477N substitution in this RBD. Materials and methods. We aimed to implement an in-house one-step real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qPCR) assay with a hydrolysis probe that specifically detects the SARS-CoV-2 Marseille-4 variant. Results. All 6 cDNA samples from Marseille-4 variant strains identified in our institute by genome next-generation sequencing (NGS) tested positive using our Marseille-4 specific qPCR, whereas all 32 cDNA samples from other variants tested negative. In addition, 39/42 (93%) respiratory samples identified by NGS as containing a Marseille-4 variant strain and 0/26 samples identified as containing non-Marseille-4 variant strains were positive. Finally, 1,585/2,889 patients SARS-CoV-2-diagnosed in our institute, 10/277 (3.6%) respiratory samples collected in Algeria, and none of 207 respiratory samples collected in Senegal, Morocco, or Lebanon tested positive using our Marseille-4 specific qPCR. Discussion. Our in-house qPCR system was found reliable to detect specifically the Marseille-4 variant and allowed estimating it is involved in more than half of our SARS-CoV-2 diagnoses since December 2020. Such approach allows the real-time surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 variants, which is warranted to monitor and assess their epidemiological and clinical characterics based on comprehensive sets of data.","Bedotto, M.; Fournier, P.-E.; Houhamdi, L.; LEVASSEUR, A.; Delerce, J.; Pinault, L.; Padane, A.; CHAMIEH, A.; TISSOT-DUPONT, H.; BROUQUI, P.; Sokhna, C.; Azar, E.; Saile, R.; Mboup, S.; Bitam, I.; Colson, P.; Raoult, D.",,18,16

As with many other diseases, natural compounds can be helpful in the treatment of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 main protease enzyme has an important role in viral replication and transcription. Therefore, inhibiting this enzyme may be helpful in the treatment of COVID-19. In this study, it is aimed to investigate eight natural compounds which have recently entered the literature, computationally for their potential use against SARS-CoV-2. For this purpose, first, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed on the investigated compounds, and energy minimizations, geometry optimizations, vibrational analyses, molecular electrostatic potential map calculations were carried out. After DFT calculations, geometry optimized structures were subjected to molecular docking calculations with the use of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (pdb id: 5r80) and top-scoring ligand-receptor complexes were obtained. In the next part of the study, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed on the top-scoring ligand-receptor complexes to investigate the stability of the ligand-receptor complexes and the interactions between ligands and receptor in more detail. Additionally, in this part of the study, binding free energies are calculated with the use of molecular mechanics with Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) method. Results showed that, all ligand-receptor complexes remain stable during the MD simulations and most of the investigated compounds but especially two of them showed considerably high binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 main protease.

This study finds that mobility to places of grocery (food and vegetable markets, drug stores etc.) and retail (restaurants, cafes, shopping centres etc.) is significantly associated (at p<0.01) with the incidence of COVID-19. In contrast, visits to parks, transit stations and mobility within residential neighbourhoods are not statistically significant (p>0.05) in changing COVID-19 cases over time.

As charcoal burning suicide victims have a unique sociodemographic profile (i.e., predominantly economically active men), they may commit suicide at specific times. However, little is known about the temporal patterns of charcoal burning suicides. METHODS: Suicide data from 2001 to 2008 on victims of usual working age (20–59) were obtained from the registered death files of the Census and Statistics Department of Hong Kong. A total of 1649 cases of charcoal burning suicide were analyzed using a two-step procedure, which first examined the temporal asymmetries in the incidence of suicide, and second investigated whether these asymmetries were influenced by sex and/or economic activity status. Poisson regression analyses were employed to model the monthly and daily patterns of suicide by economic activity status and sex. RESULTS: Our findings revealed pronounced monthly and daily temporal variations in the pattern of charcoal burning suicides in Hong Kong. Consistent with previous findings on overall suicide deaths, there was an overall spring peak in April, and Monday was the common high risk day for all groups. Although sex determined the pattern of variation in charcoal burning suicides, the magnitude of the variation was influenced by the economic activity status of the victims. CONCLUSION: The traditional classification of suicide methods as either violent or nonviolent tends to elide the temporal variations of specific methods. The interaction between sex and economic activity status observed in the present study indicates that sex should be taken into consideration when investigating the influence of economic activity status on temporal variations of suicide. This finding also suggests that suicide prevention efforts should be both time- and subgroup-specific.","Law, Chi-kin; Leung, Candi MC",BMC Public Health,18,16

The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between perceived change in physical activity or exercise and mental health outcomes over the short-term in response to COVID-19 mitigation strategies in a sample of adult twins. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 3,971 identical and same-sex fraternal adult twins (909 pairs, 77% identical) from the community-based Washington State Twin Registry. Participants in this study completed an online survey examining the impact of COVID-19 mitigation on a number of health-related behaviors and outcomes, administered between March 26 and April 5, 2020. In the present study, the exposure was perceived change in physical activity or exercise. The outcomes were levels of perceived anxiety and stress. RESULTS: More twin pairs reported a decrease in physical activity levels (42%) than those reporting no change (31%) or increased physical activity levels (27%). A perceived decrease in physical activity or exercise was associated with higher stress and anxiety levels. However, the physical activity–stress relationship was confounded by genetic and shared environmental factors. On the other hand, the physical activity–anxiety relationship held after controlling for genetic and shared environmental factors, although it was no longer significant after further controlling for age and sex, with older twins more likely to report lower levels of anxiety and females more likely to report higher levels of anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Strategies to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic may be impacting physical activity and mental health, with those experiencing a decrease in physical activity also having higher levels of stress and anxiety. These relationships are confounded by genetic and shared environmental factors, in the case of stress, and age and sex, in the case of anxiety.","Duncan, Glen E.; Avery, Ally R.; Seto, Edmund; Tsang, Siny",PLoS One,18,26

Patients with a recent diagnosis of SUD (within past year) were at significantly increased risk for COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratio or AOR = 8.699 [8.411–8.997], P < 10(−30)), an effect that was strongest for individuals with OUD (AOR = 10.244 [9.107–11.524], P < 10(−30)), followed by individuals with tobacco use disorder (TUD) (AOR = 8.222 ([7.925–8.530], P < 10(−30)). Compared to patients without SUD, patients with SUD had significantly higher prevalence of chronic kidney, liver, lung diseases, cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, obesity and cancer. Among patients with recent diagnosis of SUD, African Americans had significantly higher risk of COVID-19 than Caucasians (AOR = 2.173 [2.01–2.349], P < 10(−30)), with strongest effect for OUD (AOR = 4.162 [3.13–5.533], P < 10(−25)).

Some COVID-19 patients have exhibited widespread neurological manifestations including stroke. Acute ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis have been reported in patients with COVID-19. COVID-19-associated coagulopathy is increasingly recognized as a result of acute infection and is likely caused by inflammation, including inflammatory cytokine storm. Recent studies suggest axonal transport of SARS-CoV-2 to the brain can occur via the cribriform plate adjacent to the olfactory bulb that may lead to symptomatic anosmia. The internalization of SARS-CoV-2 is mediated by the binding of the spike glycoprotein of the virus to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on cellular membranes. ACE2 is expressed in several tissues including lung alveolar cells, gastrointestinal tissue, and brain. The aim of this review is to provide insights into the pathophysiological stroke mechanisms in COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 can down-regulate ACE2 and, in turn, over-activate the classical renin-angiotensin system (RAS) axis and decrease the activation of the alternative RAS pathway in the brain. The consequent imbalance in vasodilation, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and thrombotic response may contribute to the pathophysiology of stroke during SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Divani, Afshin A.; Andalib, Sasan; Di Napoli, Mario; Lattanzi, Simona; Hussain, M.

These issues could be overcome using micro or nanotechnology. In particular, solid lipid microparticles (SLMs) resulted as a particularly promising penetration enhancer carrier for lipophilic drugs, such as the antifungal miconazole (MCZ). Based on these considerations, cetyl decanoate (here synthesized without the use of metal catalysis) was employed together with 1-hexadecanol to prepare MCZ-loaded SLMs. These resulted in a powder composed of 45–300 µm diameter solid spherical particles, able to load a high amount of MCZ in the amorphous form and characterized by a melting temperature range perfectly compatible with oromucosal administration (35–37 °C). Moreover, when compared to Daktarin(®) 2% oral gel in ex vivo experiments, SLMs were able to increase up to three-fold MCZ accumulation into the porcine buccal mucosa. The prepared SLMs were then loaded into a buccal gel or a microcomposite mucoadhesive buccal film and evaluated in terms of MCZ permeation and/or accumulation into porcine buccal mucosa by using lower doses than the conventional dosage form. The promising results obtained highlighted an enhancement in terms of MCZ accumulation even at low doses. Furthermore, the prepared buccal film was eligible as stable, reproducible and also highly mucoadhesive. Therefore, the formulated SLMs represent a penetration enhancer vehicle suitable to reduce the dose of lipophilic drugs to be administered to achieve the desired therapeutic effects, as well as being able to be effectively embedded into easily administrable solid or semisolid dosage forms.","De Caro, Viviana; Giannola, Libero Italo; Di Prima, Giulia",Pharmaceutics,18,10

Its causative pathogen, Newcastle disease virus (NDV), also exhibits considerable oncolytic activity against mammalian cancers. A better understanding of the pathogenesis of NDV will help us design efficient vaccines and novel anticancer strategies. GW3965, a widely used synthetic ligand of liver X receptor (LXR), induces the expression of LXRs and its downstream genes, including ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1). ABCA1 regulates cellular cholesterol homeostasis. Here, we found that GW3965 inhibited NDV infection in DF-1 cells. It also inhibited NF-κB activation and reduced the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines induced by the infection. Further studies showed that GW3965 exerted its inhibitory effects on virus entry and replication. NDV infection increased the mRNA levels of several lipogenic genes but decreased the ABCA1 mRNA level. Overexpression of ABCA1 inhibited NDV infection and reduced the cholesterol content in DF-1 cells, but when the cholesterol was replenished, NDV infection was restored. GW3965 treatment prevented cholesterol accumulation in the perinuclear area of the infected cells. In summary, our studies suggest that GW3965 inhibits NDV infection, probably by affecting cholesterol homeostasis.","Sheng, Xiang-xiang; Sun, Ying-jie; Zhan, Yuan; Qu, Yu-rong; Wang, Hua-xia; Luo, Miao; Liao, Ying; Qiu, Xu-sheng; Ding, Chan; Fan, Hong-jie; Mao, Xiang",Arch Virol,18,24

As by the end of April the first epidemic wave is waning, it is important to assess the infection attack rate and quantify the impact of physical distancing. We implemented a survey to assess social mixing patterns before the epidemic and during lockdown. We estimated R0 from surveillance data and assessed its decline as a result of physical distancing based on social contacts data. We applied a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered model to estimate the infection attack rate and the infection fatality ratio (IFR). As multiple social distancing measures were implemented simultaneously (schools/work/leisure), we assessed their overall impact as well as their relative contribution. R0 was estimated 2.38 (95%CI: 2.01,2.80). By April 26th, the infection attack rate was 0.12% (95% CrI: 0.06%,0.26%) and the IFR 1.12% (95% CrI: 0.55%,2.31%). During lockdown, daily contacts were reduced by 86.9% and the effective reproduction number reached 0.46 (95% CrI: 0.35,0.57). The reduction in R0 attributed to lockdown was 81.0% (95% CrI: 71.8%,86.0%) whereas the reduction attributed to each measure separately ranged between 10%-24%. We assessed scenarios with less disruptive social distancing measures as well as scenarios where measures are partially lifted after lockdown. This is the first impact assessment of the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 in a European country. It suggests that only multiple measures implemented simultaneously could reduce R0 below 1. Measuring social mixing patterns can be a tool for real-time monitoring of the epidemic potential.","Sypsa, V.; Roussos, S.; Paraskevis, D.; Lytras, T.; Tsiodras, S.; Hatzakis, A.",,18,20

Moreover, the biological activity of selenium, which it performs mainly through selenoproteins, is discussed. These specific proteins are responsible for thyroid hormone management, fertility, the aging process, and immunity, but their key role is to maintain a redox balance in cells. Furthermore, taking into account world news and the current SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic, the impact of selenium on the course of COVID-19 is also discussed. Another worldwide problem is the number of new cancer cases and cancer-related mortality.

Due to barriers such as limited access to care, half of the women with PPD do not receive treatment. Therefore, it is critical to identify effective and scalable interventions. Traditional mindfulness programs have been effective in reducing depressive symptoms, however access remains a barrier. A self-paced mobile health (mHealth) mindfulness program may fit the lifestyle of busy mothers who are unable to attend in-person classes. However, little is known regarding the feasibility or efficacy of mHealth mindfulness interventions in postpartum women with depressive symptoms. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of an mHealth mindfulness intervention for postpartum women with moderate to moderately severe depressive symptoms. METHODS: We conducted a single-arm feasibility trial of an mHealth mindfulness intervention within Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), a large integrated health care system. Participants were identified through clinician referral and electronic health records via KPNC's universal perinatal depression screening program and recruited by the study team. Inclusion criteria included the following: English-speaking, up to 6 months postpartum with a Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) score of 10 to 19, and no regular mindfulness/meditation practice. Participants were asked to use a mindfulness app, Headspace, 10 to 20 min/day for 6 weeks. Baseline and postintervention surveys captured data on patient-reported outcomes (depression and stress symptoms, sleep quality, and mindfulness). Semistructured interviews captured acceptability. Retention and adherence were used to assess feasibility. RESULTS: Of the 115 women who were contacted and met the eligibility criteria or declined participation before eligibility assessment, 27 (23%) were enrolled. In addition, 70% (19/27) completed the study. The mean age of participants was 31 years (SD 5.2), 30% (8/27) were non-Hispanic White, and, on average, participants were 12.3 weeks postpartum (SD 5.7). Of the women who completed the study, 100% (19/19) used the Headspace app at least once, and nearly half (9/19, 47%) used the app on ≥50% of the days during the 6-week intervention period. Of the 16 participants who completed the postintervention interview, 69% (11/16) reported that they were very or extremely satisfied with the app. Interviews indicated that women appreciated the variety of meditations and felt that the program led to reduced anxiety and improved sleep. Significant improvements in pre- and postintervention scores were observed for depressive symptoms (PHQ-8: −3.8, P=.004), perceived stress (10-item Perceived Stress Scale: −6.0, P=.005), and sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index: −2.1, P=.02, indicating less sleep disturbance). Improvements in mindfulness were also significant (Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire-Short Form: 10.9, P=.01). CONCLUSIONS: An mHealth mindfulness intervention for postpartum women with moderate to moderately severe depressive symptoms is feasible and acceptable. An efficacy trial is warranted.","Avalos, Lyndsay A; Aghaee, Sara; Kurtovich, Elaine; Quesenberry Jr, Charles; Nkemere, Linda; McGinnis, MegAnn K; Kubo, Ai",JMIR Ment Health,18,10

We conducted a nation-wide survey of all heart transplant centers in Germany presenting the clinical characteristics of heart transplant recipients with COVID-19 during the first months of the pandemic in Germany. METHODS AND RESULTS: A multicenter survey of all heart transplant centers in Germany evaluating the current status of COVID-19 among adult heart transplant recipients was performed. A total of 21 heart transplant patients with COVID-19 was reported to the transplant centers during the first months of the pandemic in Germany. Mean patient age was 58.6 ± 12.3 years and 81.0% were male. Comorbidities included arterial hypertension (71.4%), dyslipidemia (71.4%), diabetes mellitus (33.3%), chronic kidney failure requiring dialysis (28.6%) and chronic-obstructive lung disease/asthma (19.0%). Most patients received an immunosuppressive drug regimen consisting of a calcineurin inhibitor (71.4%), mycophenolate mofetil (85.7%) and steroids (71.4%). Eight of 21 patients (38.1%) displayed a severe course needing invasive mechanical ventilation. Those patients showed a high mortality (87.5%) which was associated with right ventricular dysfunction (62.5% vs. 7.7%; p = 0.014), arrhythmias (50.0% vs. none; p = 0.012), and thromboembolic events (50.0% vs. none; p = 0.012). Elevated high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T- and N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide were significantly associated with the severe form of COVID-19 (p = 0.017 and p < 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: Severe course of COVID-19 was frequent in heart transplanted patients. High mortality was associated with right ventricular dysfunction, arrhythmias, thromboembolic events, and markedly elevated cardiac biomarkers.","Rivinius, Rasmus; Kaya, Ziya; Schramm, René; Boeken, Udo; Provaznik, Zdenek; Heim, Christian; Knosalla, Christoph; Schoenrath, Felix; Rieth, Andreas; Berchtold-Herz, Michael; Barten, Markus J.; Rauschning, Dominic; Mücke, Victoria T.; Heyl, Stephan; Pistulli, Rudin; Grinninger, Carola; Hagl, Christian; Gummert, Jan F.; Warnecke, Gregor; Schulze, P.

It would be desirable to rapidly characterize such outbreaks and develop accurate projections of their duration and cumulative size even when limited preliminary data are available. Here we develop a mathematical model to aid public health authorities in tracking the expansion and contraction of outbreaks with explicit representation of factors (other than population immunity) that may slow epidemic growth. METHODOLOGY: The Incidence Decay and Exponential Adjustment (IDEA) model is a parsimonious function that uses the basic reproduction number R(0), along with a discounting factor to project the growth of outbreaks using only basic epidemiological information (e.g., daily incidence counts). PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Compared to simulated data, IDEA provides highly accurate estimates of total size and duration for a given outbreak when R(0) is low or moderate, and also identifies turning points or new waves. When tested with an outbreak of pandemic influenza A (H1N1), the model generates estimated incidence at the i+1(th) serial interval using data from the i(th) serial interval within an average of 20% of actual incidence. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: This model for communicable disease outbreaks provides rapid assessments of outbreak growth and public health interventions. Further evaluation in the context of real-world outbreaks will establish the utility of IDEA as a tool for front-line epidemiologists.","Fisman, David N.; Hauck, Tanya S.; Tuite, Ashleigh R.; Greer, Amy L.",PLoS One,18,21

Due to its invasive nature and risk of contamination for health care workers who collect the sample, non-invasive and safe sampling methods like saliva, can be used alternatively. Methods: A rapid systematic search was performed in PubMed and medRxiv, with the last retrieval on June 6th, 2020. Studies were included if they compared saliva with nasopharyngeal sampling for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using the same RT-qPCR applied on both types of samples. The primary outcome of interest was the relative sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 testing on saliva versus nasopharyngeal samples (used as the comparator test). A secondary outcome was the proportion of nasopharyngeal-positive patients that tested also positive on a saliva sample. Results: Eight studies were included comprising 1070 saliva-nasopharyngeal sample pairs allowing assessment of the first outcome. The relative sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 testing on saliva versus nasopharyngeal samples was 0.97 (95% CI=0.92-1.02). The second outcome incorporated patient data (n=257) from four other studies (n=97 patients) pooled with four studies from the first outcome (n=160 patients). This resulted in a pooled proportion of nasopharyngeal positive cases that was also positive on saliva of 86% (95% CI=77-93%). Discussion: Saliva could potentially be considered as an alternative sampling method when compared to nasopharyngeal swabs. However, studies included in this review often were small and involved inclusion of subjects with insufficient information on clinical covariates. Most studies included patients who were symptomatic (78%, 911/1167). Therefore, additional and larger studies should be performed to verify the relative performance of saliva in the context of screening of asymptomatic populations and contact-tracing.","Peeters, E.; Kaur Dhillon Ajit Singh, S.; Vandesompele, J.; Mestdagh, P.; Hutse, V.; Arbyn, M.",,18,27

DESIGN: Systematic review of randomised and non-randomised controlled trials. DATA SOURCES: Medline, ISI of Knowledge, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Science Direct, Scopus, American Psychological Association PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature. STUDY SELECTION: Randomised and non-randomised controlled trials were peer reviewed using the following eligibility criteria: children and adolescents who were admitted to hospital for acute conditions or chronic disorders, studies comparing use of hospital clowns with standard care, and studies evaluating the effect of hospital clowns on symptom management of inpatient children and adolescents as a primary outcome. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two investigators independently screened studies, extracted data, and appraised the risk of bias. Methodological appraisal was assessed by two investigators independently using the Jadad scale, the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomised controlled trials (RoB 2), and the risk of bias in non-randomised studies (ROBINS-I) tool for non-randomised controlled trials. RESULTS: 24 studies (n=1612) met the inclusion criteria for data extraction and analysis. Most studies were randomised controlled trials (n=13). Anxiety was the most frequently analysed symptom (n=13), followed by pain (n=9), psychological and emotional responses and perceived wellbeing (n=4), stress (n=4), cancer related fatigue (n=3), and crying (n=2). Five studies used biomarkers, mainly cortisol, to assess stress or fatigue outcome following hospital clowns. Most of the randomised controlled trials (n=11; 85%) were rated as showing some concerns, and two trials were rated with a high risk of bias. Most non-randomised controlled trials (n=6; 55%) were rated with a moderate risk of bias according to ROBINS-I tool. Studies showed that children and adolescents who were in the presence of hospital clowns, either with or without a parent present, reported significantly less anxiety during a range of medical procedures, as well as improved psychological adjustment (P<0.05). Three studies that evaluated chronic conditions showed favourable results for the intervention of hospital clowns with significant reduction in stress, fatigue, pain, and distress (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the presence of hospital clowns during medical procedures, induction of anaesthesia in the preoperative room, and as part of routine care for chronic conditions might be a beneficial strategy to manage some symptom clusters. Furthermore, hospital clowns might help improve psychological wellbeing in admitted children and adolescents with acute and chronic disorders, compared with those who received only standard care.

Despite many successful vaccines, there are still old and new emerging pathogens against which there is no vaccine available. A better understanding of how vaccines work for providing protection will help to improve current vaccines as well as to develop effective vaccines against pathogens for which we do not have a proper means to control. Recent studies have focused on innate immunity as the first line of host defense and its role in inducing adaptive immunity; such studies have been an intense area of research, which will reveal the immunological mechanisms how vaccines work for protection. Toll-like receptors (TLRs), a family of receptors for pathogen-associated molecular patterns on cells of the innate immune system, play a critical role in detecting and responding to microbial infections. Importantly, the innate immune system modulates the quantity and quality of longterm T and B cell memory and protective immune responses to pathogens. Limited studies suggest that vaccines which mimic natural infection and/or the structure of pathogens seem to be effective in inducing long-term protective immunity. A better understanding of the similarities and differences of the molecular and cellular events in host responses to vaccination and pathogen infection would enable the rationale for design of novel preventive measures against many challenging pathogens.","Kang, Sang-Moo; Compans, Richard W.",Mol Cells,18,25
