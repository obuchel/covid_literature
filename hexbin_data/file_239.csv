800,"The Impact of Weather on Influenza and Pneumonia Mortality in New York City, 1975–2002: A Retrospective Study",2012-03-28,"The substantial winter influenza peak in temperate climates has lead to the hypothesis that cold and/or dry air is a causal factor in influenza variability. We examined the relationship between cold and/or dry air and daily influenza and pneumonia mortality in the cold season in the New York metropolitan area from 1975–2002. We conducted a retrospective study relating daily pneumonia and influenza mortality for New York City and surroundings from 1975–2002 to daily air temperature, dew point temperature (a measure of atmospheric humidity), and daily air mass type. We identified high mortality days and periods and employed temporal smoothers and lags to account for the latency period and the time between infection and death. Unpaired t-tests were used to compare high mortality events to non-events and nonparametric bootstrapped regression analysis was used to examine the characteristics of longer mortality episodes. We found a statistically significant (p = 0.003) association between periods of low dew point temperature and above normal pneumonia and influenza mortality 17 days later. The duration (r = −0.61) and severity (r = −0.56) of high mortality episodes was inversely correlated with morning dew point temperature prior to and during the episodes. Weeks in which moist polar air masses were common (air masses characterized by low dew point temperatures) were likewise followed by above normal mortality 17 days later (p = 0.019). This research supports the contention that cold, dry air may be related to influenza mortality and suggests that warning systems could provide enough lead time to be effective in mitigating the effects.","Davis, Robert E.; Rossier, Colleen E.; Enfield, Kyle B.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3314701/,239
2800,The Case for Laboratory Developed Procedures: Quality and Positive Impact on Patient Care,2017-07-16,"An explosion of knowledge and technology is revolutionizing medicine and patient care. Novel testing must be brought to the clinic with safety and accuracy, but also in a timely and cost-effective manner, so that patients can benefit and laboratories can offer testing consistent with current guidelines. Under the oversight provided by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, laboratories have been able to develop and optimize laboratory procedures for use in-house. Quality improvement programs, interlaboratory comparisons, and the ability of laboratories to adjust assays as needed to improve results, utilize new sample types, or incorporate new mutations, information, or technologies are positive aspects of Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments oversight of laboratory-developed procedures. Laboratories have a long history of successful service to patients operating under Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. A series of detailed clinical examples illustrating the quality and positive impact of laboratory-developed procedures on patient care is provided. These examples also demonstrate how Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments oversight ensures accurate, reliable, and reproducible testing in clinical laboratories.","Kaul, Karen L.; Sabatini, Linda M.; Tsongalis, Gregory J.; Caliendo, Angela M.; Olsen, Randall J.; Ashwood, Edward R.; Bale, Sherri; Benirschke, Robert; Carlow, Dean; Funke, Birgit H.; Grody, Wayne W.; Hayden, Randall T.; Hegde, Madhuri; Lyon, Elaine; Murata, Kazunori; Pessin, Melissa; Press, Richard D.; Thomson, Richard B.",Acad Pathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5528950/,239
6518,European Society of Esophagology 2007,2007-09-21,"One of the important factors and consequences in persistent asthma is the change in the vasculature of the airways and lung parenchyma. These changes could contribute to worsening asthma control and predispose asthmatics to critical asthma syndromes. For many years, the contribution of vasculature to severe asthma was limited to discussion of small and medium vessel vasculitis commonly referred to as Churg − Strauss syndrome. This comprehensive review will explore the known mechanisms that are associated with remodeling of the vasculature in a variety of critical asthma presentations. Inflammation of pulmonary and bronchial small blood vessels may contribute significantly but silently to asthma pathobiology. Inflammation in the vasculature of the lung parenchyma can decrease lung capacity while inflammation in airway vasculature can decrease airflow. This review will provide a modern perspective on Churg–Strauss syndromes with a focus on phenotyping, mechanism, and ultimately modern therapeutic approaches. Vascular remodeling and airway remodeling are not mutually exclusive concepts in understanding the progression of asthma and frequency of acute exacerbations. Furthermore, the contribution of vascular leak, particularly in the parenchymal vasculature, has become an increasingly recognized component of certain presentations of poorly controlled, severe persistent asthmatic and during exacerbations. We highlight how these mechanisms can contribute to some the severe presentations of influenza infection in patients with a history of asthma. The ultimate aim of this review is to summarize the current literature concerning vasculitis and the contribution of airway and parenchymal vascular remodeling to presentation of persistent asthma and its consequences during acute exacerbations and critical asthma syndromes.","Avdalovic, Mark",Clin Rev Allergy Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101667/,239
6657,Unexplained chronic leukopenia treated with oral iron supplements,2013-12-18,"Pseudallescheria boydii is a fungal organism known to affect immunocompromised patients. This organism is known to cause, in severe cases, invasive infection of various organs such as the central nervous, cardiovascular, and respiratory systems. We report an unusual case of pulmonary P. boydii pneumonia in an immunocompromised critically ill patient with a co-infection of Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus terreus with ARDS. This case highlights the importance of a high index of suspicion for superimposed fungal infections in patients who are critically ill and immunocompromised. Uncommon fungal pathogens should be considered in the differential diagnosis of respiratory failure, especially if diagnostic markers such as galactomannan (from BAL and serum) or 1,3-beta-d-glucan are elevated. Further diagnostic interventions are warranted when insufficient clinical improvement is observed to prevent treatment failure and adverse outcomes.","Lahmer, Tobias; Messer, Marlena; Ehmer, Ursula; Eser, Stefan; Beitz, Analena; Fekecs, Lisa; Schmid, Roland M.; Huber, Wolfgang",Mycopathologia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101908/,239

6884,Role of early diagnosis for a noninvasive treatment of pulmonary thromboembolism in leukemic children,2014-02-08,"A case of fatal Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia in a previously healthy 18-year-old girl is reported. On hospital day 9, the antibody titer to M. pneumoniae was 1:512 in the complement fixation test and 1:5120 in the microparticle agglutination assay. After five weeks in the intensive care unit, the patient died from necrotizing hemorrhagic pneumonia with multi-organ failure. No significant superinfections occurred during ICU treatment. Corticosteroids (hospital day 8 onward) did not influence the course of the disease. It is noteworthy that, as in some previously reported cases, the clinical state deteriorated during presumably adequate antibiotic treatment (2 days before admission onward), and despite documented eradication of the pathogen from the respiratory tract (PCR from bronchoalveolar fluid on hospital day 22 was negative). However, the illness had lasted for several days before admission to the hospital, therefore the potentially beneficial effect of antibiotic treatment at an early stage of the disease cannot be assessed. Clearly, in default of other treatment options, correct diagnosis and early treatment of mycoplasma community-acquired pneumonia seems mandatory. This is the third case of fatal mycoplasma pneumonia reported from Austria in recent years, making this topic worthy of further scientific attention.","Daxboeck, Florian; Eisl, Bernhard; Burghuber, Christofer; Memarsadeghi, Mazda; Assadian, Ojan; Stanek, Gerold",Wien Klin Wochenschr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102288/,239
7029,ITS ASM 2012,2012-11-04,"Respiratory tract infections are among the most common illnesses leading to medical consultation, and are associated with significant mortality. Community-acquired pneumonia is a common illness and, while Streptococcus pneumoniae continues to be the most frequent causative agent, atypical pathogens such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Legionella species are now identified as additional common aetiological agents. Since clinical and roentgenographic features poorly predict the aetiological agent in most cases of community-acquired pneumonia, empirical therapy is generally recommended. Nosocomial pneumonia is the second most common hospital-acquired infection and is associated with significant mortality. Aerobic Gram-negative bacilli and Staphylococcus aureus are the predominant causative pathogens. New techniques to improve the diagnosis of nosocomial pneumonia have been introduced, but their role has not been entirely clarified. Therapy directed toward the most likely pathogens (aerobic Gram-negative species and S. aureus) on an empirical basis is recommended until more specific information is obtained. Acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis should be treated with antimicrobial therapy directed toward S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae or Moraxella catarrhalis. Because of the emergence of β-lactamase-producing strains of H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis, the choice of an antimicrobial agent has to be carefully considered. Group A β-haemolytic streptococci are the most common cause of bacterial pharyngitis and penicillin remains the drug of choice. Patients suffering from otitis media and sinusitis are infected with the same organisms as those patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and antibacterial choices are therefore similar.","Grossman, Ronald F.",Drug Investig,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7103227/,239
7703,Special assorted cardiovascular topics,2020-03-26,"Hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) can cure both children and adults with sickle cell disease. Outcomes have historically been poor for the vast majority of patients who lack a matched sibling donor. However, the development of haploidentical HCT (haplo-HCT) with high doses of posttransplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) has allowed for curative long-term potential with favorable transplant-related outcomes, though this has not obviated the potential for graft rejection from human leukocyte antigen mismatch and repeated red blood cell transfusions. Accordingly, multiple strategies have been developed to improve outcomes, the majority of which are based on the Johns Hopkins platform from 2012. Presently, we aim to discuss results from pertinent studies and compare outcomes with the two most recent approaches involving either thiotepa plus 200-cGy total body irradiation or 400-cGy total body irradiation. Direct comparisons are required to determine the optimized curative potential. Transplant-eligible patients must be referred to tertiary medical centers for consideration of haplo-HCT.","Patel, Dilan A.; Akinsete, Adeseye M.; de la Fuente, Josu; Kassim, Adetola A.",Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7118612/,239
10645,Establishing Standardized Documentation for Anaphylaxis Treatment in a Tertiary Care Pediatric Allergy Clinic,2020-02-15,"INTRODUCTION: Direct hospital admission of children without evaluation in the emergency department (ED) is common, but few guidelines exist to maximize safety by assessing patient stability. This report describes a novel approach to support patient safety. METHODS: An interdisciplinary children’s hospital team developed a brief ED-based evaluation process called the ED Rapid Assessment of Patients Intended for Inpatient Disposition (ED RAPID). It entails a brief evaluation of vital signs and clinical stability by the ED attending physician and nurse. Children deemed stable are admitted to inpatient wards, whereas those requiring immediate intervention undergo full ED evaluation and disposition. We assessed outcomes for all children evaluated through this process from March 2013 through February 2015. RESULTS: During the study period, we identified 715 patients undergoing ED RAPID evaluation. Of these, we directly admitted 691 (96.4%) to the hospital ward after ED RAPID evaluation; median ED treatment time was 4.0 minutes. We transitioned 24 (3.4%) to full ED evaluation, 14 (2.0%) because a ward bed was unavailable, and 10 (1.4%) for clinical reasons identified in the evaluation. We admitted four of the 10 stopped (40% of stops, 0.6% of total) to an intensive care unit, and 6 (60% of stops, 0.8% of total) to the hospital ward after ED care. Eight children (1.1%) admitted to the hospital ward after ED RAPID evaluation required a transfer to an intensive care unit within 12 hours. CONCLUSION: The ED RAPID evaluation process for children directly admitted to the hospital was feasible and effective in this setting.","Louie, Jeffrey P.; Furnival, Ronald A.; Roback, Mark G.; Jacob, Abraham K.; Marmet, Jordan; Nerheim, Daniel; Hendrickson, Marissa A.",Pediatr Qual Saf,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7190248/,239

METHODS: We implemented a quality improvement (QI) study to improve iron sufficiency in our out-born level III/IV NICU. We screened 2,062 admissions, of which 622 were eligible based on feeding status at discharge. QI interventions included educational efforts and guideline implementation. Our primary outcome measure was the percentage of patients with their discharge retHE measure within the normal range. We also tracked the process measure of the number of retHE tests performed and a balancing measure of the incidence of elevated retHE among patients receiving iron supplementation. Statistical process control (SPC) charts assessed for special cause variation. RESULTS: The percentage of patients with a retHe within the normal range was significantly increased from a mean of 20% to 39% on SPC chart analysis. We measured significantly more retHE values after guideline implementation (11/mo to 24/mo) and found no cases of elevated retHE among patients receiving iron supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: After the implementation of a standardized guideline, a higher rate of iron sufficiency was found in NICU patients at discharge. This work is generalizable to neonatal populations with the potential for a significant impact on clinical practice.","Morton, Sarah U.; Yuen, Jenny Chan; Feldman, Henry A.; Hashim, Emily; Rudie, Coral; Lindamood, Kristen E.; Caughey, Daniel; Moline, Mark; Sims, Jessica K.; Sola-Visner, Martha C.; Leeman, Kristen T.",Pediatr Qual Saf,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7190262/,239
10661,Screening With Reticulocyte Hemoglobin Increased Iron Sufficiency Among NICU Patients,2020-02-13,"INTRODUCTION: Efforts to reduce central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) rates require strong microsystems for success. However, variation in practices across units leads to challenges in ensuring accountability. We redesigned the organization’s mesosystem to provide oversight and alignment of microsystem efforts and ensure accountability in the context of the macrosystem. We implemented an A3 framework to achieve reductions in CLABSI through adherence to known evidence-based bundles. METHODS: We conducted this CLABSI reduction improvement initiative at a 395-bed freestanding, academic, university-affiliated children’s hospital. A mesosystem-focused A3 emphasized bundle adherence through 3 key drivers (1) practice standardization, (2) data transparency, and (3) accountability. We evaluated the impact of this intervention on CLABSI rates during the pre-intervention (01/15-09/17) and post-intervention (07/18–06/19) periods using a Poisson model controlling for baseline trends. RESULTS: Our quarterly CLABSI rates during the pre-intervention period ranged from 1.0 to 2.3 CLABSIs per 1,000 central line-days. With the mesosystem in place, CLABSI rates ranged from 0.4 to 0.7 per 1,000 central line days during the post-intervention period. Adjusting for secular trends, we observed a statistically significant decrease in the post versus pre-intervention CLABSI rate of 71%. CONCLUSION: Our hospital-wide CLABSI rate declined for the first time in many years after the redesign of the mesosystem and a focus on practice standardization, data transparency, and accountability. Our approach highlights the importance of alignment across unit-level microsystems to ensure high-fidelity implementation of practice standards throughout the healthcare-delivery system.","Mathew, Roshni; Simms, Alison; Wood, Matthew; Taylor, Kristine; Ferrari, Sarah; Rhein, Michelle; Margallo, Dionne; Bain, Lisa C.; Valencia, Amy K.; Bargmann-Losche, Jessey; Donnelly, Lane F.; Lee, Grace M.",Pediatr Qual Saf,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7190265/,239

Several new terms for climate change-induced distress have been introduced to describe the long-term emotional consequences of anticipated or actual environmental changes, with ecological grief as a prime example. The mourning of the loss of ecosystems, landscapes, species and ways of life is likely to become a more frequent experience around the world. However, there is a lack of conceptual clarity and systematic research efforts with regard to such ecological grief. This perspective article introduces the concept of ecological grief and contextualizes it within the field of bereavement. We provide a case description of a mountaineer in Central Europe dealing with ecological grief. We introduce ways by which ecological grief may pose a mental health risk and/or motivate environmental behavior and delineate aspects by which it can be differentiated from related concepts of solastalgia and eco-anxiety.

Based on the knowledge that binding of HIV to human airway basal stem/progenitor cells (BC) induces a destructive phenotype by increased MMP-9 expression through MAPK signaling pathways, we hypothesized that HIV induces the BC to express inflammatory mediators that contribute to the pathogenesis of emphysema. Our data demonstrate that airway BC isolated from HAART-treated HIV(+) nonsmokers spontaneously release inflammatory mediators IL-8, IL-1β, ICAM-1 and GM-CSF. Similarly, exposure of normal BC to HIV in vitro up-regulates expression of the same inflammatory mediators. These HIV-BC derived mediators induce migration of alveolar macrophages (AM) and neutrophils and stimulate AM proliferation. This HIV-induced inflammatory phenotype likely contributes to lung inflammation in HIV(+) individuals and provides explanation for the increased incidence of COPD in HIV(+) individuals.","Chung, Nancy P.

18146,Prevalence and predictors of no-shows to physical therapy for musculoskeletal conditions,2021-05-28,"BACKGROUND: Shared care models present an opportunity for patients to receive the benefits of specialist care combined with the continuity of care provided by a GP. AIM: To test the effects on GP-perceived involvement in cancer care and their satisfaction with this cross-sectoral information after bringing the patient, GP, and oncologist together in a shared video consultation. DESIGN & SETTING: GPs from the Region of Southern Denmark evaluated a randomised controlled trial testing shared video consultations. METHOD: This study describes secondary outcomes based on a 4 months' follow-up survey from GPs participating in The Partnership Project (PSP). Patient perception of coordination of care at 7 months' follow-up was the primary outcome of the PSP. A tripartite video consultation was conducted during cancer treatment to share tasks and roles between health professionals with the patient. RESULTS: The study included 281 patients, and 105 unique GPs returned 124 questionnaires. Video consultations were accomplished in 68% of scheduled cases. The study found an increased odds ratio (OR) of 3.03 for GP satisfaction with the distribution of tasks and roles, and they experienced more involvement in the cancer patients' trajectory. The study found an increased OR of 6.95 for the GP perception of more direct contact and dialogue with the Department of Oncology. There was a decreased OR of 0.88 for the GP to be engaged in handling anxiety and psychological concerns. CONCLUSION: The study showed that involving the GP in one shared consultation increased the odds of the GP being satisfied with the distribution of tasks and roles, and feeling more involved in the cancer patient’s trajectory. However, recruitment and response rates from GPs were limiting factors.","Trabjerg, Theis Bitz; Jensen, Lars Henrik; Sondergaard, Jens; Wehberg, Sonja; Sisler, Jeffrey James; Hansen, Dorte Gilså",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8170612/,239

Despite substantially high prevalence of cannabis use and Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) consistently reported among veterans, little is known about psychological factors which may underlie CUD among this population. Methods: In this study, we used narrative analysis in order to interpret retrospective in-depth interviews of combat veterans (N = 12) who were released from mandatory military duty during the past 5 years and currently qualified for a diagnosis of CUD. Participants were recruited from a larger quantitative study were eligible for participation if they screened positive for a diagnosis of CUD according to the Cannabis Use Disorder Identification Test- Revised (CUDIT-R) questionnaire. CUD diagnosis was validated in-person using the cannabis section of the Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule-5 (AUDADIS-5) interview protocol. All interviews were transcribed and coded using the content analysis procedure. Findings: Five main themes were extracted: (a) Traumatic events (b) Attitudes toward cannabis use (c) Combatant identity (d) The role of authority/father figures, and (e) Moral crisis. A meta-theme has been identified, “from enchantment to disillusion,” representing a gradual psychological shift from a hopeful, highly motivated stance into the current state of mental rupture and moral injury, which are unsuccessfully compensated by excessive use of cannabis. Conclusions: This study shed light on the etiology of CUD among young combat veterans, highlighting the role of supposed self-medication for trauma and sense of betrayal.","Serebro, Miri; Sobol-Goldberg, Shira; Feingold, Daniel",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8249726/,239
19542,A Conservatively Managed Case of Intentionally Ingested Razor Blades in a Mentally Challenged Adolescent,2021-04-27,"Health depends on the diet and a vegetal diet promotes health by providing fibres, vitamins and diverse metabolites. Remarkably, plants may also provide microbes. Fungi and bacteria that reside inside plant tissues (endophytes) seem better protected to survive digestion; thus, we investigated the reported evidence on the endophytic origin of some members of the gut microbiota in animals such as panda, koala, rabbits and tortoises and several herbivore insects. Data examined here showed that some members of the herbivore gut microbiota are common plant microbes, which derived to become stable microbiota in some cases. Endophytes may contribute to plant fibre or antimetabolite degradation and synthesis of metabolites with the plethora of enzymatic activities that they display; some may have practical applications, for example, Lactobacillus plantarum found in the intestinal tract, plants and in fermented food is used as a probiotic that may defend animals against bacterial and viral infections as other endophytic‐enteric bacteria do. Clostridium that is an endophyte and a gut bacterium has remarkable capabilities to degrade cellulose by having cellulosomes that may be considered the most efficient nanomachines. Cellulose degradation is a challenge in animal digestion and for biofuel production. Other endophytic‐enteric bacteria may have cellulases, pectinases, xylanases, tannases, proteases, nitrogenases and other enzymatic capabilities that may be attractive for biotechnological developments, indeed many endophytes are used to promote plant growth. Here, a cycle of endophytic‐enteric‐soil‐endophytic microbes is proposed which has relevance for health and comprises the fate of animal faeces as natural microbial inoculants for plants that constitute bacterial sources for animal guts.","Martínez‐Romero, Esperanza; Aguirre‐Noyola, José Luis; Bustamante‐Brito, Rafael; González‐Román, Pilar; Hernández‐Oaxaca, Diana; Higareda‐Alvear, Víctor; Montes‐Carreto, Leslie M.; Martínez‐Romero, Julio César; Rosenblueth, Mónica; Servín‐Garcidueñas, Luis Eduardo",Microb Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8313258/,239

Methods: From October 2006 until December 2020, 38 consecutive patients with histologically confirmed POPs were standardized-examined by CEUS. The time to enhancement (TE; classified as an early pulmonary-arterial [PA] pattern of enhancement vs. delayed bronchial-arterial [BA] pattern of enhancement), the extent of enhancement (EE; classified as marked or reduced), the homogeneity of enhancement (HE; classified as homogeneous or inhomogeneous), and the decrease of enhancement (DE; classified as rapid washout [<120s] or late washout [≥120s]) were evaluated retrospectively. Furthermore, tissue samples from the study patients were immunohistochemically stained with CD34 antibody. The presence of avascular areas (AAs) and the VPs were evaluated in all tissue samples. Results: The majority of POPs showed a BA pattern of enhancement (71.1%), an isoechoic marked enhancement (76.3%), and an inhomogeneous enhancement (81.6%). A rapid DE was observed in 50.0% of cases. On CD34 staining, all POPs had a chaotic VP, indicating BA neoangiogenesis. AAs (abscess, necrosis, hemorrhage) were identified in (41.9%) cases with an inhomogeneous enhancement on CEUS. Conclusion: On CEUS, POPs predominantly revealed a marked inhomogeneous BA pattern of enhancement with a rapid washout in 50% of cases. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the presence of a PA pattern of enhancement, found in 28.9% of POPs, did not exclude a BA neoangiogenesis as an important feature of chronic inflammatory and malignant processes.","Safai Zadeh, Ehsan; Westhoff, Christina Carolin; Keber, Corinna Ulrike; Trenker, Corinna; Dietrich, Christoph Frank; Alhyari, Amjad; Mohr, Charlotte Gabriele Luise; Görg, Christian",Diagnostics (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8468045/,239

The relation of skeletal maturation to obesity is undetermined. The study aims to evaluate skeletal maturation in children and adolescents with obesity, to correlate it with their anthropometric data, body fat content, BMI, fat mass and pubertal stage. RESULTS: Our study shows that obese children and adolescents have accelerated skeletal maturation compared to control normal-weight healthy subjects (mean skeletal age difference of 0.123 ± 0.67 years versus − 0.175 ± 0.32 years). Also, there were significant positive correlations between bone age and BMI (r = 0.435, P value 0.00). CONCLUSION: The mean skeletal age difference was more in the obese group as compared to the control group and suggesting accelerated skeletal development in the obese group. It is important to assess skeletal maturity in growing patients to determine the best timing for orthopedic and orthodontic treatment around the growth spurt.","Ibrahim, Rania S.

We also used the MEM method to evaluate three seasons of composite data (ILI% multiplied by percent of ILI with laboratory-confirmed influenza) as recommended by WHO. RESULTS: The WHO method estimated the seasonal ILI% threshold at 0.9%. The annual epidemic period began on average at week 46 and lasted an average of 18 weeks. The MEM model estimated the epidemic threshold (corresponding to the WHO seasonal threshold) at 1.5% of ILI visits among all outpatient consultations. The annual epidemic period began on week 49 and lasted on average 14 weeks. Intensity thresholds were similar using both methods. When using the composite measure, the MEM method showed a clearer estimate of the beginning of the influenza epidemic, which was coincident with a sharp increase in confirmed ILI cases. CONCLUSIONS: We found that the threshold methodology presented in the WHO manual is simple to implement and easy to adopt for use by the Moroccan influenza surveillance system. The MEM method is more statistically sophisticated and may allow a better detection of the start of seasonal epidemics. Incorporation of virologic data into the composite parameter as recommended by WHO has the potential to increase the accuracy of seasonal threshold estimation.","Rguig, Ahmed; Cherkaoui, Imad; McCarron, Margaret; Oumzil, Hicham; Triki, Soumia; Elmbarki, Houria; Bimouhen, Abderrahman; El Falaki, Fatima; Regragui, Zakia; Ihazmad, Hassan; Nejjari, Chakib; Youbi, Mohammed",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7323370/,239

The first comes from a group of young people in Paris who smoke electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), who refer to themselves as “vapoteurs,” and the second comes from a group of young people in Makassar who smoke synthetic cannabinoids. The young people partaking in these popular practices value the social bonding they experience; they are also bombarded with social media messages encouraging the use of these products. And both face harms that may increase the precariousness of their lives: the Makassarian youth face imprisonment if discovered, and the health consequences of these synthetics are not fully understood. Similarly, the Parisian youth also risk lung damage, as vaping, while advertised as “safer” and sought out as a means to reduce the harms associated with cigarette smoke, exposes consumers to chemicals that either are understudied or known to be threats to health. The chapter concludes by pointing how these young people’s lives would benefit from sensible government regulation.","Hardon, Anita",Chemical Youth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7552728/,239
41161,Reimagining long-term care,2020-10-22,"PURPOSE: Sedation management of trauma patients after damage control laparotomy (DCL) has not been optimized. We evaluated if shorter sedation exposure was associated with increased proportion of delirium-free/coma-free (DF/CF-ICU) days and change in time to definitive fascial closure (DFC). METHODS: We reviewed trauma DCL patients at an ACS-verified level I center over 5 years as shorter (SE) or longer than median (LE) sedation exposure. We compared demographics, injury patterns, hemodynamic parameters, and injury severity between groups. We calculated the propensity for each patient to achieve DFC using age, gender, ISS, red blood cell transfusion, bowel discontinuity, abdominal vascular injury, and time to first takeback; we then determined the effect of sedation exposure on rate of DFC by multivariate Cox regression, adjusted for propensity to achieve DFC. We used linear regression adjusted for age, ISS, head-AIS, bowel discontinuity, and vascular injury to determine the effect of sedation exposure on the proportion of DF/CF-ICU days. RESULTS: 65 patients (33.8% penetrating) had mean age 41.8 ± 16.0, ISS 27.1 ± 14.2, Head-AIS 1.2 ± 1.6 and median sedation exposure of 2.2 [IQR 0.78, 7.3] days (35 SE and 30 LE). Pattern and severity of solid organ injuries and proportion of small and large bowel and vascular injuries were similar between groups. LE had more abdominal sepsis (23.3% vs 0%, p = 0.003) and enterocutaneous fistula (16.7% vs 0%, p = 0.016), and more ventilator (17.3 ± 12.7 vs 6.1 ± 6.8, p < 0.001), ICU (20.8 ± 14.2 vs 7.2 ± 7.6, p < 0.001), and hospital days (29.6 ± 19.6 vs 13.9 ± 9.0, p < 0.001). DFC was achieved more rapidly in the SE group (2.0 ± 1.5 days vs 3.9 ± 3.7 days [unadjusted], p = 0.023) and SE had a higher proportion of unadjusted DF/CF-ICU days (33.0 ± 32.0% vs 18.1 ± 16.4%, p = 0.020). SE was associated with an increased proportion of adjusted DF/CF-ICU days by multivariate linear regression (13.1% [95% CI 1.4–24.8%], p = 0.029) and with faster adjusted rate of DFC by multivariate Cox regression (RR 2.28 [95% CI 1.25–4.15, p = 0.007]). CONCLUSIONS: Shorter sedation exposure is associated with increased proportion of DF/CF-ICU days and more rapid DFC after DCL for trauma.

43311,The Social Worker in the Nursing Home: A Systematic Review of the Literature from 2010 to 2020,2020-12-16,"Ocular chemical burns are potentially blinding ocular injuries and require urgent management. Amniotic membrane (AM) transplantation is an effective surgical treatment, one of the reasons is because AM is a rich source of growth factors that can promote epithelialization and wound healing. However, growth factors will be gradually lost and insufficient after preparation process and long-time storage, leading to unsatisfactory therapeutic effects. Herein, we present a modified AM (AM-HEP) for the supplement and sustained release of growth factor by surface grafting heparin for treatment of ocular chemical burns. Heparin grafting rate and stability, microstructure, physical property, and sustained release of epithelial growth factor (EGF) of AM-HEP were characterized. Biocompatibility and ability to promote corneal epithelial cell growth and migration were evaluated and compared with a biological amnion, which is available on the market in vitro. The therapeutic effects of AM-HEP combined with EGF (AM-HEP@EGF) in vivo had been evaluated in a model of mouse corneal alkali burn. The results indicated that heparin was introduced into AM and maintain stability over 3 weeks at 37°C. The modification process of AM-HEP did not affect microstructure and physical property after comparing with non-modified AM. EGF could be combined quickly and effectively with AM-HEP; the sustained release could last for more than 14 days. AM-HEP@EGF could significantly promote corneal epithelial cell growth and migration, compared with non-modified AM and control group. Faster corneal epithelialization was observed with the transplantation of AM-HEP@EGF in vivo, compared with the untreated control group. The corneas in the AM-HEP@EGF group have less inflammation and were more transparent than those in the control group. The results from in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that AM-HEP@EGF could significantly enhance the therapeutic effects. Taken together, AM-HEP@EGF is exhibited to be a potent clinical application in corneal alkali burns through accelerating corneal epithelial wound healing.","Zhao, Xuan; Zuo, Xin; Zhong, Jing; Wang, Bowen; Li, Saiqun; Xiao, Yichen; Yuan, Jin",Front Bioeng Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7719686/,239

It also resulted in suspending medical student placements which are heavily relied upon to provide the students with necessary “hands-on” experience. Virtual Reality (VR) simulation was employed in order to ensure that the students had a comparable experience. METHOD: VR simulations were used to simulate the ward environments and the students were able to gain valuable experience with common scenarios encountered on surgical wards. Each student was allocated a 1-hour time slot per session with a debriefing session after each. The digital immersive environment allowed students to build upon their didactic preparation and previously acquired knowledge base. RESULTS: Feedback was given at the end of each simulation by the simulation facilitator. Using the technical proficiency that they had acquired in the first scenario; the students went on to employ these skills directly in their next scenarios thereby capitalising on the repetition of core skills to maximize their learning. CONCLUSIONS: In this instance, VR was successfully used to enhance both knowledge acquisition and experience. Feedback from the participating students was overwhelmingly positive with many suggesting that they were more comfortable learning in a simulated environment.","Carty, I; Shah, R",Br J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135718/,239

Its prevention, early detection, proper and adequate treatment and control should be given high consideration to prevent occurrence of cardiovascular disease and stroke. This study is guided by the Health Belief Model (HBM) to investigate the influence of treatment compliance using HBM constructs among elderly hypertensive patients in 3 regional hospitals in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. METHODS: An analytical cross-sectional study was conducted in 3 region hospitals in Dar es Salaam from April to May 2012. The study included patients who were on antihypertensive medications. Simple Random Sampling was used to enrol the study participants. Data was collected using structured questionnaire. Data was analysed using SPSS version 20. Linear Multiple Regression analysis was performed to identify variables which are strongest predictor of treatment compliance among variables of the Health belief Model. RESULTS: A total of 135 participants were enrolled of whom 56% were compliant to hypertensive treatment. Multivariate analysis indicated significant model fit for the data (F=11.19 and P value <.001). The amount of variance in treatment compliance that was explained by the predictors was 30.3% (R(2)=0.303) with perceived barrier being the strongest predictor of treatment compliance (β=−0.477; p< .001). Other predictor variables were not statistically associated with treatment compliance. CONCLUSION: The study showed that 56% of study participants had hypertensive treatment compliance and perceived barrier to treatment was the strongest predictor. Innovative strategy on improving patients’ perception of barrier to treatment is recommended in order to improve treatment compliance.","Joho, Angelina Alphonce",East Afr Health Res J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8291213/,239

Many US elites now tie such notions to China’s response to Covid-19. Their racialized framing of the drive to condemn and sue China however exemplifies a Chinese idiom—“big thunder, little rain” (雷声大, 雨点小)—which means noisy, yet ineffective. There are empirical obstacles to convincing the world of Chinese responsibility for the pandemic, such as that the virus spread much more from Europe and the US than from China, many Western states failed against the virus, and pandemic-related agitation against China has resulted in many anti-Asian actions. The ongoing claims are thus unlikely to be convincing beyond the Anglosphere, but still spread racism and advance a US-led anti-China mobilization.","Sautman, Barry",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8500121/,239

59181,Maintaining acute stroke care during the covid-19 pandemic: The Tuscany stroke network performance in 2020,2021-10-08,"The concept of social exclusion has had an astonishing career in the social sciences. The focus of this paper is an empirical investigation of the use of this concept to analyze current societal trends. From this theoretical perspective we derive four theses, which are empirically tested in this paper with a focus on the perception of exclusion: First, that because of the processes of economic structural change, larger population groups are affected by social exclusion in several dimensions (unemployment, poverty, social isolation), culminating in a subjective sense of exclusion among them. Thus, it is assumed that social exclusion has become the main social cleavage in contemporary society. Second, it is assumed that social exclusion cannot be clearly located in classical sociostructural categories but has diffused into broad segments of society. Third, socioeconomic precariousness and social isolation are thought to play a central role in the emergence of a subjective sense of exclusion. Here, and fourth, it is assumed, however, that this impacts on the sense of exclusion via the subjective perception of the objective life conditions. We test these theses derived from this theoretical perspective on the basis of survey data, using the sense of exclusion as a dependent variable. It becomes clear that, first, social exclusion has not diffused into large parts of society and thus can by no means be regarded as the main social cleavage in society; and second, an increased sense of exclusion can be found in different but clearly identifiable social groups. Moreover, our analyses show that the subjective sense of exclusion is rooted in both social isolation and socioeconomic precariousness, albeit clearly mediated by their subjective perception.","Djouadi, Audrey; Rössel, Jörg; Seifert, Alexander",Kolner Z Soz Sozpsychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8506478/,239
59214,Pediatric haedaches epidemiology in emergency department during COVID-19,2021-10-08,"COVID-19 caused significant challenges for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the event industry. To address these challenges, many SMEs leveraged information and communication technologies (ICTs), with some even emerging strengthened from the crisis. Drawing on the technology-organization-environment framework and technology-affordances-and-constraints theory, we investigate the adoption of ICTs as a crisis response strategy in 10 SMEs in the German business event (e.g., corporate events, conferences) industry. Our findings reveal that ICT adoption not only depends on rational decisions based on organizational, environmental, and technological characteristics, but also on these dimensions’ interrelationship and the specific ICTs’ affordances and constraints. Introducing readily available ICTs (e.g., video-conferencing) has significant potential in addressing physical distancing in the short and medium term, while more sophisticated ICTs (e.g., virtual reality) are more likely to gain importance in the long term. Thus, we expand our understanding of organizational technology adoption and ICT-enabled crisis response strategies in SMEs.","Wendt, Charlotte; Adam, Martin; Benlian, Alexander; Kraus, Sascha",Inf Syst Front,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8510881/,239
59626,Decreased Case Fatality Rate of COVID-19 in the Second Wave: a study in 53 countries or regions.,2020-09-06,"Background We previously reported that we developed a compact and portable isolation hood that covers the top half of a patient sitting or lying in bed. The negative pressure inside the hood is generated by a fan-filter-unit (FFU) through which infectious aerosols from a patient are filtered. The outside area is kept clean which decreases the risk of nosocomial infections in hospital wards. We tried new applications of the hood. Methods The negative pressure hood was newly applied in an intensive care unit (ICU) as a place where a staff performs the practice of suctioning that generates much aerosol from the patient, as well as a waiting space for patients. Furthermore, the possibility that the hood can be converted to a positive pressure hood as a clean hood by switching the airflow direction of FFU was assessed. The cleaning efficacy of the inside of the hood was tested using an aerosolized cultured influenza virus tracer and an optimal airflow rate was determined according to the test results. Results The hood, named Barrihood, was found to be competent to be used (I) for tracheal suctioning in ICU, (II) as a waiting space for a child in a nursery who suddenly showed symptoms of the disease and waiting to be picked-up by the guardian, and (III) as a waiting space in a special outpatient clinic in a hospital for COVID-19 suspected cases to prevent dissemination of airborne pathogens. The positive pressure hood was also competent in keeping clean air quality that meets the standard class 100 of NASA's bio-clean room category. Conclusions The proposed new applications will broaden the range of the hood's usage. The isolation hood could be useful in many settings to protect people outside the hood from a patient inside, or to protect an individual inside from air particles outside the hood, such as airborne pathogens, allergens, or hazardous particulate matter like PM2.5.","Nishimura, Hidekazu; Fan, Yuxuan; Sakata, Soichiro",Journal of thoracic disease,https://doi.org/10.21037/jtd-20-1211; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32802428/,239

METHOD A systematic literature review, following a prespecified (but unregistered) protocol developed to adhere to recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses, was conducted to understand endpoints and outcomes used in acute migraine clinical trials. Predefined terms were searched in PubMed to locate clinical trials assessing acute migraine treatments. Final database search was conducted on October 28, 2019. Identified publications were reviewed against established inclusion and exclusion criteria to determine eligibility. Data related to general trial design characteristics, sample characteristics, and outcomes and endpoints reported in each publication were extracted from eligible publications. Descriptive summaries of design features, sample characteristics, and the endpoints and outcomes employed across publications were constructed. Outcomes are presented within four broad categories: (a) pain-related outcomes (pain relief, pain freedom, etc.), (b) associated symptoms (nausea, photophobia, etc.), (c) disability/impairment/impact, (d) patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs, general health and migraine/headache-specific). Endpoint types were categorized within three broad categories: (a) change from baseline, (b) fixed timepoint, and (c) responder definitions (e.g., 50% reduction). This review focuses on a subset of recent (1998 or later) randomized and blinded publications evaluating drugs or medical devices. RESULTS Of 1567 publications found through the initial search and reference section reviews, 705 met criteria and were included for data extraction. Inter-rater agreement kappas for the descriptive variables extracted had an average kappa estimate of 0.86. The more recent, randomized and blinded pharmaceutical and medical device article subset includes 451 publications (451/705, 63.9%). The outcomes and endpoints varied substantially across trials, ranging from pain relief or freedom, freedom from or relief of migraine-associated symptoms, use of acute or rescue medication, and various other PROMs, including measures of satisfaction and quality of life. Within the recent randomized and blinded article subset, most articles examined ≥1 pain-related outcome (430/451, 95.3%). Of the publications that examined pain, outcomes most often used were pain relief (310/430, 72.1%), pain freedom (279/430, 64.9%), and headache recurrence (202/43,051, 47.0%) or rescue medication use (278/430, 64.9%). Associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were more frequently measured (299/451, 66.3%) compared to most bothersome associated symptom (16/451, 3.5%), as it is a new addition to regulatory guidance. Over one-third of eligible publications examined disability/impairment (186/451, 41.2%) or ≥1 PROM (159/451, 35.3%). The definition of the endpoints used (e.g., change from baseline, fixed timepoint comparisons, categorization of ""responders"" to treatment based on wide variety of ""responder definitions"") also differed substantially across publications. CONCLUSION Acute migraine clinical trials exhibit a large amount of variability in outcomes and endpoints used, in addition to the variability in how outcomes and endpoints were used from trial-to-trial. There were some common elements across trials that align with guidance from the International Headache Society, the Food and Drug Administration and other regulatory agencies (e.g., assessing pain and associated symptoms, 2-hour post-treatment). Other aspects of acute migraine clinical trial design did not follow guidance. For example, multi-item PROMs intended to measure constructs (e.g., scales) are rarely used, the use of pain-related outcomes is inconsistent, some associated symptom assessments are idiosyncratic, and the timing of the assessment of primary endpoints is variable. The development of a core set of outcomes and endpoints for acute migraine clinical trials that are patient-centered and statistically robust could improve the conduct of individual trials, facilitate cross-trial comparisons, and better support informed treatment decisions by healthcare professionals and patients.","Houts, Carrie R; McGinley, James S; Nishida, Tracy K; Buse, Dawn C; Wirth, R J; Dodick, David W; Goadsby, Peter J; Lipton, Richard B",Headache,https://doi.org/10.1111/head.14067; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33611818/,239
62737,Pilot assessment of an on-demand telehealth 'left without being seen' follow-up programme.,2021-01-21,"BACKGROUND Pain is one of the first presenting symptoms in patients with head and neck cancer, who often develop chronic and debilitating pain as the disease progresses. Pain is also an important prognostic marker for survival. Unfortunately, patients rarely receive effective pain treatment due to our limited knowledge of the mechanisms underlying head and neck cancer pain (HNCP). Pain is often associated with neuroinflammation and particularly interleukin (IL)-1 signaling. The purpose of this study is to develop a novel syngeneic model of HNCP in immunocompetent mice to examine the contribution of IL-1 signaling. METHODS Male C57BL/6 mice were injected with a murine model of human papillomavirus (HPV+)-induced oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma in their right hindlimb to induce tumor growth. Pain sensitivity was measured via von Frey filaments. Spontaneous pain was assessed via the facial grimace scale. IL-1β was measured by quantifying gene expression via quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS Pain hypersensitivity and spontaneous pain develop quickly after the implantation of tumor cells, a time when tumor volume is still insignificant. Spinal and circulating IL-1β levels are significantly elevated in tumor-bearing mice. Blocking IL-1 signaling either by intrathecal administration of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) or by genetic deletion (interleukin-1 receptor knockout [Il1r1]) does not alleviate HNCP. CONCLUSIONS We established the first syngeneic model of HNCP in immunocompetent mice. Unlike inflammatory or nerve-injured pain, HNCP is independent of IL-1 signaling. These findings challenge the common belief that pain results from tissue compression or IL-1 signaling in patients with head and neck cancer.","Heussner, Matthew J; Folger, Joseph K; Dias, Christina; Massri, Noura; Dahdah, Albert; Vermeer, Paola D; Laumet, Geoffroy",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0000000000005302; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33323783/,239

64765,Internal Medicine and COVID-19.,2020-09-22,"OBJECTIVES Identify risk factors for venous thromboembolism and develop venous thromboembolism risk assessment models for pediatric trauma patients. DESIGN Single institution and national registry retrospective cohort studies. SETTING John Hopkins level 1 adult and pediatric trauma center and National Trauma Data Bank. PATIENTS Patients 21 years and younger hospitalized following traumatic injuries at John Hopkins (1987-2011). Patients 21 years and younger in the National Trauma Data Bank (2008-2010 and 2011-2012). INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Clinical characteristics of Johns Hopkins patients with and without venous thromboembolism were compared, and multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent venous thromboembolism risk factors. Weighted risk assessment scoring systems were developed based on these and previously identified factors from National Trauma Data Bank patients (2008-2010); the scoring systems were validated in this cohort from Johns Hopkins and a cohort from the National Trauma Data Bank (2011-2012). Forty-nine of 17,366 pediatric trauma patients (0.28%) were diagnosed with venous thromboembolism after admission to our trauma center. After adjusting for potential confounders, venous thromboembolism was independently associated with older age, surgery, blood transfusion, higher Injury Severity Score, and lower Glasgow Coma Scale score. These and additional factors were identified in 402,329 pediatric patients from the National Trauma Data Bank from 2008 to 2010; independent risk factors from the logistic regression analysis of this National Trauma Data Bank cohort were selected and incorporated into weighted risk assessment scoring systems. Two models were developed and were cross-validated in two separate pediatric trauma cohorts: 1) 282,535 patients in the National Trauma Data Bank from 2011 to 2012 and 2) 17,366 patients from Johns Hopkins. The receiver operating curve using these models in the validation cohorts had area under the curves that ranged 90-94%. CONCLUSIONS Venous thromboembolism is infrequent after trauma in pediatric patients. We developed weighted scoring systems to stratify pediatric trauma patients at risk for venous thromboembolism. These systems may have potential to guide risk-appropriate venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in children after trauma.","Yen, Jennifer; Van Arendonk, Kyle J; Streiff, Michael B; McNamara, LeAnn; Stewart, F Dylan; Conner, Kim G; Thompson, Richard E; Haut, Elliott R; Takemoto, Clifford M",Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies,https://doi.org/10.1097/pcc.0000000000000699; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26963757/,239

In light of recent influx of CATs in the UKA, a review of these innovations will help providers to understand their clinical utility. METHOD A systematic literature search was performed following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis guidelines. RESULTS Among 19 studies comparing robot-assisted UKA with conventional UKA, only 32% were randomized control trials, 47% reported minimum mean follow-up of 2 years, and 21% evaluated prosthesis survival. Similar results were obtained for navigation-assisted UKA and UKA performed with patient-specific instrumentation. CONCLUSION While CATs seem to reduce the surgical errors in UKA, the evidence on the efficacy of any of the studied CATs to improve survivorship remains limited and there are issues related to cost-effectiveness, learning curve, and increase in operating time.","Mittal, Anurag; Meshram, Prashant; Kim, Tae Kyun",The international journal of medical robotics + computer assisted surgery : MRCAS,https://doi.org/10.1002/rcs.2302; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34196097/,239

The aim of this research was to characterize the nutritional composition and the flour functional properties, for the use as a potential food source. Seed flour was analysed using a standard enzymatic assay for sugars, acid/neutral detergent analysis for fibre, ether extraction for fat and HPLC for strychnine. Results showed that the seeds contained 41% reducing sugars and 53% fibre. The mineral composition, determined using microwave-assisted acid digestion and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), showed that the seeds contained high quantities of iron (15.78 mg/100 g) and manganese (9.86 mg/100 g). The flour water absorption index (1.37 g/g) was substantially higher than that of wheat, brown rice and tapioca flours and the oil absorption index showed similarities to the reference flours (1.09 g/g). The flour peak (37,788 RVU) and final viscosities (62,928 RVU) were significantly (p < 0.001) higher than the reference flours. This study was the first to quantify the strychnine content (0.08%) in the seeds.

Method: We describe COVID-19 and HUS by outlining the similarities and differences, detailing each one's pathway into the body, explaining the consequences of the inflammatory response, mainly on multiple organ dysfunction, the foremost complication that can lead to death in both cases. Using reviews from specialized literature and guidelines, we had an approach based on critical interpretive synthesis. Nonetheless, the present article has certain limitations, mainly due to the short period from the emergence of the virus and the everincreasing body of research that have been shedding light each day. Discussion: Both COVID-19 and HUS require binding to a membrane receptor to trigger the pathophysiological mechanism. Despite the evident difference in tropism, both conditions develop with severe endothelial dysfunction, microangiopathy and important inflammatory response, responsible for MODS. The role of the coagulation pathway is more significant in COVID-19 but less in HUS. Excessive complement activation appears to be a determinant of severe prognosis in both diseases. Regarding COVID-19, children have a milder symptomatology than adults, but in some cases the paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (PIMS) is described.","Balgradean, Mihaela; Cinteza, Eliza; Aria, Lorena Amelia; Matei, Roxana Lincan; Marin, Lavinia; Moga, Lorena; Negritoru, Sabina Crina; Slavulete, Ramona Elena; Stefan, Maria Cristina; Ionescu, Marcela",Maedica,https://doi.org/10.26574/maedica.2020.15.3.376; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33312255/,239

Insufficient dexterity, visual impairment, and cognitive dysfunction, found commonly in older adults should be taken into consideration in the development and utilization of existing technologies. If not implemented strategically and appropriately, these can lead to inequities propagating digital divides among older adults, across disease severities and socioeconomic distributions.

71646,COVID-19: looking forward.,2020-04-29,"The aim of the present European Stroke Organisation Transient Ischaemic Attack (TIA) management guideline document is to provide clinically useful evidence-based recommendations on approaches to triage, investigation and secondary prevention, particularly in the acute phase following TIA. The guidelines were prepared following the Standard Operational Procedure for a European Stroke Organisation guideline document and according to GRADE methodology. As a basic principle, we defined TIA clinically and pragmatically for generalisability as transient neurological symptoms, likely to be due to focal cerebral or ocular ischaemia, which last less than 24 hours. High risk TIA was defined based on clinical features in patients seen early after their event or having other features suggesting a high early risk of stroke (e.g. ABCD2 score of 4 or greater, or weakness or speech disturbance for greater than five minutes, or recurrent events, or significant ipsilateral large artery disease e.g. carotid stenosis, intracranial stenosis). Overall, we strongly recommend using dual antiplatelet treatment with clopidogrel and aspirin short term, in high-risk non-cardioembolic TIA patients, with an ABCD2 score of 4 or greater, as defined in randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We further recommend specialist review within 24 hours after the onset of TIA symptoms. We suggest review in a specialist TIA clinic rather than conventional outpatients, if managed in an outpatient setting. We make a recommendation to use either MRA or CTA in TIA patients for additional confirmation of large artery stenosis of 50% or greater, in order to guide further management, such as clarifying degree of carotid stenosis detected with carotid duplex ultrasound. We make a recommendation against using prediction tools (eg ABCD2 score) alone to identify high risk patients or to make triage and treatment decisions in suspected TIA patients as due to limited sensitivity of the scores, those with score value of 3 or less may include significant numbers of individual patients at risk of recurrent stroke, who require early assessment and treatment. These recommendations aim to emphasise the importance of prompt acute assessment and relevant secondary prevention. There are no data from randomised controlled trials on prediction tool use and optimal imaging strategies in suspected TIA.","Fonseca, Ana Catarina; Merwick, Áine; Dennis, Martin; Ferrari, Julia; Ferro, José M; Kelly, Peter; Lal, Avtar; Ois, Angel; Olivot, Jean Marc; Purroy, Francisco",European stroke journal,https://doi.org/10.1177/2396987321992905; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34414299/,239

In this respect, the empirical and theoretical dimensions of the contents of those impacts are analyzed. Research findings reveal a significant relationship between contingency actions and positive indirect impacts such as air quality improvements, clean beaches, and the decline in environmental noise. Besides, negative indirect impacts also exist, such as the rise in waste level and curtailment in recycling, further threatening the physical spaces (land and water), besides air. It is expected that global businesses will revive in the near future (though slowly), but the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions during this short time span is not a sustainable way of environmental mitigation. Thus, long-term mitigation policies should be strengthened to cope with the undesirable deterioration of the environment.

A systematic review of home-based visual acuity for telemedicine.,2020-11-22,"INTRODUCTION In people living with HIV (PLWH), immune activation and inflammation levels are high even when viral suppression is maintained, potentially contributing to several comorbidities, and hampering the immune response to infections such as the recent SARS-CoV2 disease 2019 (COVID-19). AREAS COVERED Immune activation and inflammation play a role in SARS-CoV2 infection. Severe COVID-19 patients may experience cytokine release syndrome (CRS), leading to alveolar damage, pulmonary fibrinolysis, dysregulated coagulation, and pulmonary injury. Into the systemic circulation, cytokines in excess might leak out of pulmonary circulation, causing systemic symptoms and possibly a multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Pre-existing comorbidities are also linked to worse COVID-19 outcome: studies suggest that diabetes and hypertension are linked to higher mortality rates. Such comorbidities are more frequent in PLWH; but it is unclear if they have worse outcomes in case of COVID-19. Literature was searched in PubMed/MEDLINE and EMBASE, and manually in COVID-19 resources. EXPERT OPINION A body of evidence shows that HIV and SARS-CoV2 are able to activate inflammatory pathways, acute in the case of SARS-CoV2, chronic in the case of HIV, while the comorbidities seem to represent, in the first case, a contributory cause, in the second an effect of the virus-induced damage.","Maggi, Paolo; Ricci, Elena; Messina, Vincenzo; Salzillo, Angela; Simeone, Filomena; Iodice, Angelo; Socio, Giuseppe Vittorio De",Expert review of clinical immunology,https://doi.org/10.1080/1744666x.2021.1886080; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33538189/,239

The scaffolds for vascular tissue engineering remain a cornerstone of these efforts and yet many currently available options are limited by issues of inconsistency, poor adherence of vascular cells, or inadequate biomechanical properties. In this study, we investigated whether PCL/collagen scaffolds could support cell growth and withstand physiologic conditions while maintaining patency in a rabbit aortoiliac bypass model. Our results indicate that electrospun scaffolds support adherence and growth of vascular cells under physiologic conditions and that endothelialized grafts resisted adherence of platelets when exposed to blood. When implanted in vivo, these scaffolds were able to retain their structural integrity over 1 month of implantation as demonstrated by serial ultrasonography. Further, at retrieval, these scaffolds continued to maintain biomechanical strength that was comparable to native artery. This study suggests that electrospun scaffolds combined with vascular cells may become an alternative to prosthetic vascular grafts for vascular reconstruction.","Tillman, Bryan W; Yazdani, Saami K; Lee, Sang Jin; Geary, Randolph L; Atala, Anthony; Yoo, James J",Biomaterials,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.10.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18990437/,239

DESIGN Pooled cross-sectional survey data. SETTING Health Information National Trends Survey. PARTICIPATION Data included 6 iterations of U.S. adults (Pooled: N = 19,496; 2007: N = 3,593; 2011: N = 3,959; 2013: N = 3,185; FDA 2015: N = 3,738; 2017: N = 3,285; and FDA 2017: N = 1,736). MEASURES Outcome variables were health information seeking, high confidence, and high trust of health information from several sources. Independent variables were education and income group, controlling for other sociodemographic variables. ANALYSIS Weighted descriptive and multivariate logistic regression for the pooled sample assessed associations by education and income. Fully interacted models with education/income-survey year interactions compared differences in outcomes between years. RESULTS We found information seeking, confidence, and trust were associated with income and education, which supported previously reported findings. Additionally, our findings indicated low-and medium-income groups had significantly lower odds of seeking health information compared to those in a high-income group. Regarding trust of information, a high school education was associated with higher odds of trust in family and friends. We also found that, over time, information seeking, confidence, and trust behavior differed by income and education, with some differences persisting. CONCLUSION Disparities by income and education in trust of information sources remained across time. Understanding optimal information sources, their reach, and their credibility among groups could enable more targeted interventions and health messaging.

72932,Monitoring and Intervention Technologies to Manage Diabetic Older Persons: The CAPACITY Case-A Pilot Study.,2020,"Background: Dementia has a significant impact on quality of life of older individuals. Impaired proteostasis has been implicated as a potential cause of dementia, that can be therapeutically targeted to improve patient outcomes. This review aimed to collate all current evidence of the potential for targeting proteostasis with repurposed drugs as an intervention for age-related dementia and cognitive decline. Methods: PubMed, Web of Science and Embase databases were searched from inception until 4th July 2017 for studies published in English. Interventional studies of repurposed proteostasis-modifying drugs in Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Lewy Body disease, vascular dementia, and cognitive aging, in either animal models or humans with change in cognition as the outcome were included. The SYRCLE and Cochrane tools were used to assess risk of bias for included studies. Results: Overall 47 trials, 38 animal and 9 human, were isolated for inclusion in this review. Drugs tested in animals and humans included lithium, rapamycin, rifampicin, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Drugs tested only in animals included Macrophage and Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factors, methylene blue, dantrolene, geranylgeranylacetone, minocycline and phenylbutyric acid. Lithium (n = 10 animal, n = 6 human) and rapamycin (n = 12 animal, n = 1 human) were the most studied proteostasis modifying drugs influencing cognition. Nine of ten animal studies of lithium showed a statistically significant benefit in Alzheimer's models. Rapamycin demonstrated a significant benefit in models of vascular dementia, aging, and Alzheimer's, but may not be effective in treating established Alzheimer's pathology. Lithium and nilotinib had positive outcomes in human studies including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's patients respectively, while a human study of rifampicin in Alzheimer's failed to demonstrate benefit. Microdose lithium showed a strongly significant benefit in both animals and humans. While the risk of bias was relatively low in human studies, the risk of bias in animal studies was largely unclear. Conclusion: Overall, the collective findings support the hypothesis that targeting proteostasis for treatment of dementia may be beneficial, and therefore future studies in humans with repurposed proteostasis modifying drugs are warranted. Larger human clinical trials focusing on safety, efficacy, tolerability, and reproducibility are required to translate these therapeutics into clinical practice.","Heard, Daniel S; Tuttle, Camilla S L; Lautenschlager, Nicola T; Maier, Andrea B",Frontiers in physiology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2018.01520; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30425653/,239
73351,"The Virtual Pediatric Perioperative Home, Experience at a Major Metropolitan Safety Net Hospital.",2021-03-12,"UNLABELLED Bats have been implicated as reservoirs of emerging viruses. Bat species forming large social groups and roosting in proximity to human communities are of particular interest. In this study, we sampled a colony of ca. 350,000 individuals of the straw-colored fruit bat Eidolon helvum in Kumasi, the second largest city of Ghana. A novel rhabdovirus (Kumasi rhabdovirus [KRV]) was isolated in E. helvum cell cultures and passaged to Vero cells as well as interferon-competent human and primate cells (A549 and MA104). Genome composition was typical for a rhabdovirus. KRV was detected in 5.1% of 487 animals, showing association with the spleen but not the brain. Antibody prevalence was 11.5% by immunofluorescence and 6.4% by plaque reduction virus neutralization test (PRNT). Detection throughout 3 sampling years was pronounced in both annual wet seasons, of which only one overlaps the postparturition season. Juvenile bats showed increased viral prevalence. No evidence of infection was obtained in 1,240 female mosquitos (6 different genera) trapped in proximity to the colony to investigate potential vector association. Antibodies were found in 28.9% (5.4% by PRNT) of 107 swine sera but not in similarly large collections of sheep, goat, or cattle sera. The antibody detection rate in human subjects with occupational exposure to the bat colony was 11% (5/45 persons), which was significantly higher than in unexposed adults (0.8% [1/118]; chi square, P < 0.001). KRV is a novel bat-associated rhabdovirus potentially transmitted to humans and swine. Disease associations should be investigated. IMPORTANCE Bats are thought to carry a huge number of as-yet-undiscovered viruses that may pose epidemic threats to humans and livestock. Here we describe a novel dimarhabdovirus which we isolated from a large colony of the straw-colored fruit bat Eidolon helvum in Ghana. As these animals are exposed to humans and several livestock species, we looked for antibodies indicating infection in humans, cattle, swine, sheep, and goats. Signs of infection were found in swine and humans, with increased antibody findings in humans who are occupationally exposed to the bat colony. Our data suggest that it is worthwhile to look for diseases caused by the novel virus in humans and livestock.","Binger, Tabea; Annan, Augustina; Drexler, Jan Felix; Müller, Marcel Alexander; Kallies, René; Adankwah, Ernest; Wollny, Robert; Kopp, Anne; Heidemann, Hanna; Dei, Dickson; Agya-Yao, Festus Courage; Junglen, Sandra; Feldt, Torsten; Kurth, Andreas; Oppong, Samuel; Adu-Sarkodie, Yaw; Drosten, Christian",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02932-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25673701/,239
73592,Rethinking Hospital-Associated Disability for Patients With COVID-19.,2020-11-18,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Shunt dependent hydrocephalus after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) is a common sequela that may lead to poor neurological outcome and predisposes to various interventions, admissions, and complications. We reviewed post-aSAH shunt dependency in a population-based sample and tested the feasibility of a clinical risk score to identify subgroups of aSAH patients with increasing risk of shunting for hydrocephalus. METHODS A total of 1533 aSAH patients from the population-based Eastern Finland Saccular Intracranial Aneurysm Database (Kuopio, Finland) were used in a recursive partitioning analysis to identify risk factors for shunting after aSAH. The risk model was built and internally validated in random split cohorts. External validation was conducted on 946 aSAH patients from the Southwestern Tertiary Aneurysm Registry (Dallas, TX) and tested using receiver-operating characteristic curves. RESULTS Of all patients alive ≥14 days, 17.7% required permanent cerebrospinal fluid diversion. The recursive partitioning analysis defined 6 groups with successively increased risk for shunting. These groups also successively risk stratified functional outcome at 12 months, shunt complications, and time-to-shunt rates. The area under the curve-receiver-operating characteristic curve for the exploratory sample and internal validation sample was 0.82 and 0.78, respectively, with an external validation of 0.68. CONCLUSIONS Shunt dependency after aSAH is associated with higher morbidity and mortality, and prediction modeling of shunt dependency is feasible with clinically useful yields. It is important to identify and understand the factors that increase risk for shunting and to eliminate or mitigate the reversible factors. The aSAH-PARAS Consortium (Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Patients' Risk Assessment for Shunting) has been initiated to pool the collective insights and resources to address key questions in post-aSAH shunt dependency to inform future aSAH treatment guidelines.","Adams, Hadie; Ban, Vin Shen; Leinonen, Ville; Aoun, Salah G; Huttunen, Jukka; Saavalainen, Taavi; Lindgren, Antti; Frosen, Juhana; Fraunberg, Mikael; Koivisto, Timo; Hernesniemi, Juha; Welch, Babu G; Jaaskelainen, Juha E; Huttunen, Terhi J",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.116.013739; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27633019/,239
73656,Mechanical ventilation competencies of the respiratory therapist in 2015 and Beyond.,2013,"Previous studies have investigated rabies virus (RABV) epizootiology in Brazilian free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) in natural cave roosts. However, little is known about geographic variation in RABV exposure, or if the use of man-made roosts by this species affects enzootic RABV infection dynamics within colonies. We sampled rabies viral neutralizing antibodies in bats at three bridge and three cave roosts at multiple time points during the reproductive season to investigate temporal and roost variation in RABV exposure. We report seropositive bats in all age and sex classes with minimal geographic variation in RABV seroprevalence among Brazilian free-tailed bat colonies in south-central Texas. While roost type was not a significant predictor of RABV seroprevalence, it was significantly associated with seasonal fluctuations, suggesting patterns of exposure that differ between roosts. Temporal patterns suggest increased RABV seroprevalence after parturition in cave colonies, potentially related to an influx of susceptible young, in contrast to more uniform seroprevalence in bridge colonies. This study highlights the importance of life history and roost ecology in understanding patterns of RABV seroprevalence in colonies of the Brazilian free-tailed bat.","Turmelle, Amy S; Allen, Louise C; Jackson, Felix R; Kunz, Thomas H; Rupprecht, Charles E; McCracken, Gary F",Vector borne and zoonotic diseases,https://doi.org/10.1089/vbz.2008.0163; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19492942/,239
73880,STEMI Care and COVID-19: The Value Proposition of Pharmacoinvasive Therapy.,2020-04-27,"OBJECTIVES Fulminant viral hepatitis (FH) remains a serious clinical problem for which the underlying pathogenesis remains unclear. The B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) is an immunoglobulin-domain-containing protein that has the capacity to maintain peripheral tolerance and limit immunopathological damage during immune responses. However, its precise role in FH has yet to be investigated. DESIGN BTLA-deficient (BTLA-/-) mice and their wild-type littermates were infected with murine hepatitis virus strain-3 (MHV-3), and the levels of tissue damage, cell apoptosis, serum liver enzymes, fibrinogen-like protein 2 (FGL2) and cytokine production were measured and compared. Survival rate was studied after MHV-3 infection with or without adoptive transferring macrophages. RESULTS FGL2 production, liver and spleen damage, and mortality were significantly reduced in BTLA-/- mice infected with MHV-3. This effect is due to rapid, TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand)-dependent apoptosis of MHV-3-infected macrophages in BTLA-/- mice. The early loss of macrophages resulted in reduced pathogenic tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα) and FGL2 levels and lower viral titres. The importance of TNFα in MHV-3-induced pathology was demonstrated by increased mortality in TNFα-treated MHV-3-infected BTLA-/- mice, whereas TNFα-/- mice were resistant to the infection. Moreover, adoptively transferring macrophages to BTLA-/- mice caused sensitisation, whereas blocking BTLA protected wild-type mice from virus-induced FH mortality. CONCLUSIONS BTLA promotes the pathogenesis of virus-induced FH by enhancing macrophage viability and function. Targeting BTLA may be a novel strategy for the treatment of FH.","Yang, Chengying; Chen, Yongwen; Guo, Guoning; Li, Hong; Cao, Dayan; Xu, Huan; Guo, Sheng; Fei, Lei; Yan, Weiming; Ning, Qing; Zheng, Lixin; Wu, Yuzhang",Gut,https://doi.org/10.1136/gutjnl-2012-302239; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22637698/,239
74216,"Letter to the Editor Regarding ""Medical Student Concerns Relating to Neurosurgery Education During COVID-19"".",2021-06-01,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS The immunomodulatory activity of thymosin α1 (Tα1) on innate immunity has been extensively described, but its mechanism of action is not completely understood. We explored the possibility that Tα1-stimulation could affect the formation of podosomes, the highly dynamic, actin-rich, adhesion structures involved in macrophage adhesion/chemotaxis. METHODS The following methods were used: optical and scanning electron microscopy for analyzing morphology of human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs); time-lapse imaging for visualizing the time-dependent modifications induced at early times by Tα1 treatment; confocal microscopy and Western blot for analyzing localization and expression of podosome components; and Matrigel Migration Assay and zymography for testing MDM invasive ability and metalloproteinase secretion. RESULTS We obtained data to support that Tα1 could affect MDM motility, invasion and chemotaxis by promptly stimulating assembly and disassembly of podosomal structures. At very early times after its addition to cell culture medium and within 1 h of treatment, Tα1 induces modifications in MDM morphology and in podosomal components that are suggestive of increased podosome turnover. CONCLUSIONS Since impairment of podosome formation leads to reduced innate immunity and is associated with several immunodeficiency disorders, we confirm the validity of Tα1 as a potent activator of innate immunity and suggest possible new clinical application of this thymic peptide.","Serafino, Annalucia; Andreola, Federica; Pittaluga, Eugenia; Krasnowska, Ewa K; Nicotera, Giuseppe; Sferrazza, Gianluca; Sinibaldi Vallebona, Paola; Pierimarchi, Pasquale; Garaci, Enrico",Expert opinion on biological therapy,https://doi.org/10.1517/14712598.2015.1024221; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26098689/,239
75098,Paediatric hearing aid use: a systematic review.,2021-08-19,"OBJECTIVE To examine the effects of exposure to conflicting nutritional information (CNI) through different forms of media on nutrition-related confusion and backlash among consumers in the United Kingdom. DESIGN Cross-sectional survey administered via Qualtrics among 18-75 year-old participants in the UK. The sample was stratified by age and gender with quotas defined according to the 2011 UK census distribution. SETTING Qualtrics' Online panel of respondents in the United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS 676 participants comprising nearly an equal number of females (n=341) and males (n=335) and a majority (58.6%) from households whose income was less than £30,000. RESULTS Our findings showed that nearly 40% of respondents were exposed to some or a lot of CNI. We found that while exposure to CNI from TV and online news increased nutrition confusion, CNI from health professionals increased backlash. Exposure to CNI from social media and health websites was associated with reduced backlash. We also found that nutrition confusion and backlash were negatively associated with exercise behavior and fruit and vegetable consumption respectively. CONCLUSION Our study supports the theoretical pathways that explain the influence of CNI exposure on nutrition-related cognitive and behavioral outcomes. Additionally, different types of online information sources are associated with these outcomes to varying degrees. In the context of obesity and diabetes rates in the UK, our findings call for a) further experimental research into the effects of CNI on consumers' diet-related cognitions and behaviors, and b) multi-stakeholder, interdisciplinary approaches to address this problem.","Vijaykumar, Santosh; McNeill, Andrew; Simpson, Josh",Public health nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1368980021000124; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33431107/,239
75484,Diabetes and COVID-19.,2020-05-15,"AIM Although it is suggested that an appendectomy has a positive effect on the disease course in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), recent studies indicate a potential increased risk of colectomy and colorectal cancer (CRC). This study aimed to evaluate colectomy and CRC rate after appendectomy in UC patients using a nationwide prospective database (ICC PSI-IBD database). METHOD All UC patients were retrieved from the ICC PSI-IBD database between Jan 2007 and May 2018. Primary outcomes were colectomy and CRC. Outcomes were compared in patients with and without appendectomy, with a separate analysis for timing of appendectomy (before or after UC diagnosis). RESULTS In total, 826 UC patients (54.7% female, median age 46 years (range 18-89)) were included. Sixty-three (7.6%) patients previously underwent an appendectomy: 24 (38.1%) before and 33 (52.4%) after diagnosing UC. In multivariate analysis, appendectomy after UC diagnosis was associated with a significantly lower colectomy rate compared to no appendectomy (HR 0.16, 95% CI 0.04-0.66; P=0.011), and the same non-significant trend was seen in patients with an appendectomy before UC diagnosis (HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.08-1.41; P=0.138). Appendectomy was associated with delayed colectomy, particularly when performed after diagnosing UC (P=0.009). No significant differences were found in CRC rate between patients with and without appendectomy (1.6% versus 1.2%; P=0.555). CONCLUSIONS Appendectomy in established UC is associated with an 84% decreased colectomy risk and a delay in surgery. Since the colon is in situ longer, the risk of developing CRC remains, which underscores the importance of endoscopic surveillance programs.","Stellingwerf, Merel E; Bemelman, Willem A; Löwenberg, Mark; Ponsioen, Cyriel Y; D'Haens, Geert R; van Dieren, S; Buskens, Christianne J",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,https://doi.org/10.1111/codi.15184; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32524670/,239

Physicians have been encouraged to consider cost in the selection of devices, but several factors make acquiring cost information difficult. To assess physicians' levels of knowledge about costs, we asked orthopedic attending physicians and residents at seven academic medical centers to estimate the costs of thirteen commonly used orthopedic devices between December 2012 and March 2013. The actual cost of each device was determined at each institution; estimates within 20 percent of the actual cost were considered correct. Among the 503 physicians who completed our survey, attending physicians correctly estimated the cost of the device 21 percent of the time, and residents did so 17 percent of the time. Thirty-six percent of physicians and 75 percent of residents rated their knowledge of device costs ""below average"" or ""poor."" However, more than 80 percent of all respondents indicated that cost should be ""moderately,"" ""very,"" or ""extremely"" important in the device selection process.

75998,Identifying rheumatic disease patients at high risk and requiring shielding during the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020-05-01,"PURPOSE Inexperienced physicians frequently have difficulty performing nasal fiberoptic intubation. A pre-inserted tracheal tube of the appropriate length allows an excellent view of the laryngeal opening. The purpose of this study was to determine the ideal length of a pre-inserted tracheal tube for nasal fiberoptic intubation and to investigate if it could be predicted from easily measureable patient parameters. METHODS This was an observational study in which data on adult patients (n = 150) requiring nasal intubation were collected and analyzed by stepwise regression. During the pre-anesthesia examination, a right-angled gauge was used to measure the distance from the mid-point of the lateral border of the nares to the tragus of the ear (NT distance) and to the mandibular angle (NM distance). The distance from the tragus to the mandibular angle (TM distance) was also measured. The age, sex, height, and weight of each patient were recorded. After induction of anesthesia, the minimum and maximum lengths of the pre-inserted tracheal tube that provided an excellent view of laryngeal opening during nasal fiberoptic intubation were measured. The optimal length was calculated, and an equation was derived through stepwise regression analysis. RESULTS The optimal length for each patient could be reliably predicted using the equation (distances in cm, weight in kg): optimal length (cm) = 1.952 + 0.051 × height (cm) + 0.354 × NM distance (cm) - 0.011 × weight (kg) (r (2) = 0.460, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION The optimal length of pre-inserted tracheal tube for nasal fiberoptic intubation can be predicted using a newly developed formula with three patient parameters, namely, height, the NM distance, and weight. Application of this equation in the clinical setting should facilitate nasal fiberoptic intubation.","Lee, Jiwon; Lee, Jung-Man; Min, Jeong Jin; Koo, Chang-Hoon; Kim, Hyun Jeong",Journal of anesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00540-015-2088-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26499319/,239

Susceptibility-weighted magnetic resonance imaging can identify both emboli to distal territories (EDT) and new territories (ENT) as new susceptibility vessel signs (SVS). Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) can identify infarcts in new territories (INT). METHODS We studied consecutive acute ischemic stroke patients undergoing magnetic resonance imaging before and after thrombectomy. Frequency, predictors, and outcomes of EDT and ENT detected on gradient-recalled echo imaging (EDT-SVS and ENT-SVS) and INT detected on DWI (INT-DWI) were analyzed. RESULTS Among 50 thrombectomy-treated acute ischemic stroke patients meeting study criteria, mean age was 70 (±16) years, 44% were women, and presenting National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score 15 (interquartile range, 8-19). Overall, 21 of 50 (42%) patients showed periprocedural embolic events, including 10 of 50 (20%) with new EDT-SVS, 10 of 50 (20%) with INT-DWI, and 1 of 50 (2%) with both. No patient showed ENT-SVS. On multivariate analysis, model-selected predictors of EDT-SVS were lower initial diastolic blood pressure (odds ratio, 1.09 [95% CI, 1.02-1.16]), alteplase pretreatment (odds ratio, 5.54 [95% CI, 0.94-32.49]), and atrial fibrillation (odds ratio, 7.38 [95% CI, 1.02-53.32]). Classification tree analysis identified pretreatment target occlusion SVS as an additional predictor. On univariate analysis, INT-DWI was less common with internal carotid artery (5%), intermediate with middle cerebral artery (25%), and highest with vertebrobasilar (57%) target occlusions (P=0.02). EDT-SVS was not associated with imaging/functional outcomes, but INT-DWI was associated with reduced radiological hemorrhagic transformation (0% versus 54%; P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS Among acute ischemic stroke patients treated with thrombectomy, imaging evidence of distal emboli, including EDT-SVS beyond the target occlusion and INT-DWI in novel territories, occur in about 2 in every 5 cases. Predictors of EDT-SVS are pretreatment intravenous fibrinolysis, potentially disrupting thrombus structural integrity; atrial fibrillation, possibly reflecting larger target thrombus burden; lower diastolic blood pressure, suggestive of impaired embolic washout; and pretreatment target occlusion SVS sign, indicating erythrocyte-rich, friable target thrombus.","Wong, Gregory J; Yoo, Bryan; Liebeskind, David; Baharvahdat, Humain; Gornbein, Jeffrey; Jahan, Reza; Szeder, Viktor; Duckwiler, Gary; Tateshima, Satoshi; Colby, Geoffrey; Nour, May; Sharma, Latisha; Rao, Neal; Hinman, Jason; Starkman, Sidney; Saver, Jeffrey L",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.120.033377; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34011171/,239

Methods An online training program was designed by the Shanghai Pediatric Clinical Quality Control Center (SPQCC) during the early phase of COVID-19 pandemic on disease knowledge and practice of IPC. Training took place in the 81 partner hospitals affiliated with SPQCC. A multicenter, cross-sectional questionnaire survey was designed with a 25-item self-administered questionnaire to evaluate the knowledge gained from the training. Stratified-random sampling was used to select HCW according to three professionals (i.e., pediatricians, nurses and administrators) within each partner hospital. Awareness and knowledge of COVID-19 and its related infection control and practice were assessed by comparing survey results between different types of hospitals, professionals and professional ranks. A higher survey score meant that the respondent was more prepared and knowledgeable about COVID-19 and its infection control measures. Results Completed questionnaires were returned from 1,062 subjects (385 pediatricians, 410 nurses, and 267 administrators), giving a response rate of 96.5%. Overall, awareness of clinical information related to COVID-19, importance of personal hygiene and isolation policy was high among the respondents. No statistical difference of scores on knowledge of COVID-19, IPC and relevant practice between the tertiary and peripheral hospitals. Among all respondents, middle-ranked health care personnel were most knowledgeable and achieved the highest score. Conclusions Majority of pediatric HCW showed good recognition and practice in infection protection and control measures.

MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed a prospective registry for demographics, hospital course, and discharge dispositions of rehab-eligible acute stroke survivors admitted 6 months prior to (10/2019-03/2020) and during (04/2020-09/2020) the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary outcome was discharge to an inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF) as opposed to other facilities using descriptive statistics, and IRF versus home using unadjusted and adjusted backward stepwise logistic regression. RESULTS Of the 507 rehab-eligible stroke survivors, there was no difference in age, premorbid disability, or stroke severity between study periods (p>0.05). There was a 9% absolute decrease in discharges to an IRF during the pandemic (32.1% vs. 41.1%, p=0.04), which translated to 38% lower odds of being discharged to IRF versus home in unadjusted regression (OR 0.62, 95%CI 0.42-0.92, p=0.016). The lower odds of discharge to IRF persisted in the multivariable model (aOR 0.16, 95%CI 0.09-0.31, p<0.001) despite a significant increase in discharge disability (median discharge mRS 4 [IQR 2-4] vs. 2 [IQR 1-3], p<0.001) during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS Admission for stroke during the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a significantly lower probability of being discharged to an IRF. This effect persisted despite adjustment for predictors of IRF disposition, including functional disability at discharge.

Our aim was to study the efficacy of endovascular flow modification on aneurysm-induced mass effect and compression syndrome, as demonstrated by cross-sectional imaging studies and clinical follow-up. MATERIALS AND METHODS Thirty aneurysms larger than 10 mm were treated by flow diversion alone and previously had undergone pre- and posttreatment cross-sectional imaging. Pretreatment MR imaging or contrast CT, follow-up angiography at 6 months, and follow-up MR imaging studies between 6 and 18 months were retrospectively analyzed. The neurologic and neuro-ophthalmologic statuses of all patients were recorded before treatment and at the time of follow-up cross-sectional imaging. RESULTS At 6 months, 28 aneurysms were completely occluded, 1 had a neck remnant, and 1 had residual filling on angiography. Between 6 and 18 months, 3 aneurysms decreased in size and 27 completely collapsed as demonstrated on MR imaging. Before treatment, 6 patients had vision loss, 10 had double vision due to a third or sixth nerve palsy or both, and 1 had hemiparesis due to brain stem compression. On MR imaging follow-up, vision loss had either improved or resolved in all except 1 patient, double vision had resolved completely (7/10) or partially (3/10), and the patient with brain stem compression became asymptomatic. There was no bleeding observed in this series. One parent artery thrombosis resulted in a major infarct.

Aquatic and recreation centres in Victoria, Australia were recruited to co-develop and pilot pricing interventions within their onsite cafés, for 15 weeks from January 2019. A mixed method intervention evaluation was conducted. Interviews were conducted with food retail managers to understand the factors perceived to influence implementation, maintenance and effectiveness. Customer surveys assessed support for, and awareness of, interventions. Interrupted time series analysis estimated the impact of pricing interventions on food and beverage sales. Three centres each implemented a unique intervention: (i) discounted healthy bundles ('healthy combination deals'), (ii) offering deals at specific times of the day ('healthy happy hours') and (iii) increasing the prices of selected unhealthy options and reducing the prices of selected healthier options ('everyday pricing changes'). Café team leaders did not identify any significant challenges to implementation or maintenance of interventions, though low staff engagement was identified as potentially influencing the null effect on sales for healthy combination deals and healthy happy hours interventions. Customers reported low levels of awareness and high levels of support for interventions. Everyday pricing changes resulted in a significant decrease in sales of unhealthy items during the intervention period, though also resulted in a decrease in café revenue.

These transmission events can threaten the health of wild birds. There is growing evidence of transmission of vaccine viruses from poultry to wild birds, including attenuated vaccine strains of Newcastle disease virus and infectious bronchitis virus, and also spread of virulent viruses that may have evolved under the pressure of vaccine use, such as Marek's disease virus. Viral contaminants of poultry vaccines, including reticuloendotheliosis virus, may also be transmitted to wild birds and result in disease. New, vectored vaccines are less likely to directly spread to wild birds but this risk may rise as a result of recombination.","Devlin, Joanne M; Vaz, Paola K; Coppo, Mauricio Jc; Browning, Glenn F",Current opinion in virology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coviro.2016.06.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27359320/,239

However, no phase III study comparing adjuvant chemotherapy regimens for rectal cancer has demonstrated superiority of a specific regimen. We therefore conducted a phase III study to evaluate the superiority of S-1 to tegafur-uracil (UFT), a standard adjuvant chemotherapy regimen for curatively resected stage II/III rectal cancer in Japan, in the adjuvant setting for rectal cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS The ACTS-RC trial was an open-label, randomized, phase III superiority trial conducted at 222 sites in Japan. Patients aged 20-80 with stage II/III rectal cancer undergoing curative surgery without preoperative therapy were randomly assigned to receive UFT (500-600 mg/day on days 1-5, followed by 2 days rest) or S-1 (80-120 mg/day on days 1-28, followed by 14 days rest) for 1 year. The primary end point was relapse-free survival (RFS), and the secondary end points were overall survival and adverse events. RESULTS In total, 961 patients were enrolled from April 2006 to March 2009. The primary analysis was conducted in 480 assigned to receive UFT and 479 assigned to receive S-1. Five-year RFS was 61.7% [95% confidence interval (CI) 57.1% to 65.9%] for UFT and 66.4% (95% CI 61.9% to 70.5%) for S-1 [P = 0.0165, hazard ratio (HR): 0.77, 95% CI 0.63-0.96]. Five-year survival was 80.2% (95% CI 76.3% to 83.5%) for UFT and 82.0% (95% CI 78.3% to 85.2%) for S-1. The main grade 3 or higher adverse events were increased alanine aminotransferase and diarrhea (each 2.3%) in the UFT arm and anorexia, diarrhea (each 2.6%), and fatigue (2.1%) in the S-1 arm. CONCLUSION One-year S-1 treatment is superior to UFT with respect to RFS and has therefore become a standard adjuvant chemotherapy regimen for stage II/III rectal cancer following curative resection.","Oki, E; Murata, A; Yoshida, K; Maeda, K; Ikejiri, K; Munemoto, Y; Sasaki, K; Matsuda, C; Kotake, M; Suenaga, T; Matsuda, H; Emi, Y; Kakeji, Y; Baba, H; Hamada, C; Saji, S; Maehara, Y",Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,https://doi.org/10.1093/annonc/mdw162; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27056996/,239
82126,Risk factors for early mortality following modern total hip arthroplasty.,2013,"OBJECTIVE In recent studies, the COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with increased risk of mental health problems across many subpopulations including pregnant and postnatal women. This study examined the prevalence and correlates of depressive symptoms (depression hereafter) in Chinese pregnant and postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS This is a multicentre, cross-sectional study comprising 1,309 pregnant and postpartum women across 12 provinces in China during the COVID-19 pandemic. Depression was assessed using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9). Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted. RESULTS The prevalence of depression in pregnant and postpartum women was 27.43% (95% CI=25.01%-29.85%). Women who were worried about themselves or their babies being infected with COVID-19 (OR=2.562, 95%CI=1.670-3.929), and those who had delayed regular medical check-ups (OR=2.434, 95%CI=1.580-3.750) were at higher risk of depression. Compared to those living in central and western parts of China, women living in northern (OR=0.513, 95%CI=0.326-0.807) and southeastern parts of China (OR=0.626, 95%CI=0.463-0.846) were less likely to have depression."" CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with an increased likelihood of mental health problems among pregnant and postnatal women. Over a quarter of the pregnant and postpartum women in China suffered from depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. Considering the negative health impact of depression, preventive measures, regular mental health screening and medical check-ups are needed with the goal to reduce the risk of depression in this vulnerable population during a pandemic.","Bo, Hai-Xin; Yang, Yuan; Chen, Jie; Zhang, Meng; Zhang, Dong-Ying; Li, Ying; Li, Rui; Cheung, Teris; Ng, Chee H; Wu, Xin-Juan; Xiang, Yu-Tao",Psychosomatic medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/psy.0000000000000904; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33337594/,239

Owing to its high prevalence and detrimental impact on personal, social, and economic aspects of patient lives, much desire has gone into fully understanding the pathogenesis of migraine, and to search for therapeutic agents. In addition to current therapeutics such as triptans, ergotamine, and monoclonal antibodies targeting calcitonin gene-related peptide receptors, vitamin B12 has been investigated for its possible use as a prophylactic agent for migraines. Specifically, the observed effects of vitamin B12 on nitric oxide and homocysteine prompt further investigation of its underlying mechanisms in migraine pathophysiology. In this comprehensive review, we provide a brief overview of migraines and current therapies while focusing on the promising role of vitamin B12 as a possible treatment option for chronic migraine management.","Urits, Ivan; Yilmaz, Melis; Bahrun, Ehab; Merley, Caitlin; Scoon, Logan; Lassiter, Grace; An, Daniel; Orhurhu, Vwaire; Kaye, Alan D; Viswanath, Omar",Best practice & research.

83417,Neuroimaging of headaches associated with vascular disorders.,2015,"BACKGROUND The fundamentals of endoscopic surgery (FES) examination measures the knowledge and skills required to perform safe flexible endoscopy. A potential limitation of the FES skills test is the size and cost of the simulator on which it was developed (GI Mentor II virtual reality endoscopy simulator; Simbionix LTD, Israel). A more compact and lower-cost alternative (GI Mentor Express) was developed to address this issue. The purpose of this study was to obtain evidence for the validity of scores obtained on the Express platform, so that it can be used for testing. STUDY DESIGN General surgery residents at various levels of training and practicing endoscopists at five institutions participated. Each completed the five FES tasks on both simulator platforms in random order, with 3-14 days between tests. Scores were calculated using the same standardized computer-generated algorithm and compared using Pearson's correlation coefficient. RESULTS There were 58 participants (mean age 32; 76% male) with a broad range of endoscopic experience. The mean (95% confidence interval) FES scores were 72 (67:77) on the GI Mentor II and 66 (60:71) on the Express. The correlation between scores on the two platforms was 0.86 (0.77:0.91; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION There is a high correlation between FES manual skills scores measured on the original platform and the new Express, providing evidence to support the use of the GI Mentor Express for FES testing.","Mueller, Carmen L; Kaneva, Pepa; Fried, Gerald M; Mellinger, John D; Marks, Jeffrey M; Dunkin, Brian J; van Sickle, Kent; Vassiliou, Melina C",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-015-4307-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26139481/,239
83895,Halitosis and Pain Post Electrocautery Adenoidectomy.,2019,"Tendon injury is common in sports. The standard of care (SOC) for tendon repair is surgical treatment. However, restored tendons often lack complete strength and functionality, and surgical repair is often unsuccessful. This controlled laboratory study investigates the healing of an Artelon patch (AP)-augmented tendon versus tendon repair alone in a preclinical canine patellar tendon defect model. Full-thickness proximal and distal flap defects were created in the patella tendons of eight purpose-bred research mongrel dogs. Dogs were randomly allocated into either the AP-augmented repair group or the SOC group (N = 8; four knees per group). Outcomes measures included limb function and pain; range of motion (ROM) and ultrasound assessment at 2, 4, and 8 weeks; and measurements of elongation, biomechanical testing, and histology at 8 weeks. Data were compared for statistically significant differences to preoperative measures and between groups (p < 0.05). The AP group had higher limb function scores compared with the SOC group at 2, 4, and 8 weeks, with statistically significant differences observed at 2 weeks (AP: 7.1 ± 1.4, SOC: 5.5 ± 0.4, p < 0.05) and 8 weeks (AP: 9.5 ± 0.7, SOC: 7.0 ± 0.9, p < 0.05). The ROM was significantly higher for the AP group at 4 weeks (AP: 105 degrees ± 4, SOC: 89 degrees ± 5, p < 0.05). Pain scores were statistically significantly lower in the AP group at 4 (AP: 0.6 ± 0.5, SOC: 2.2 ± 0.5) and 8 weeks (p < 0.05 for both comparisons). All animals in the AP group displayed full bridging tissue at week 4, while most animals of the SOC group displayed full bridging by week 8. Minimal tendon elongation was observed in both groups. Significantly more force was required to elongate tendons in the AP group compared with the SOC group (p < 0.05). Animals with AP-augmented tendon repair show an earlier regain of function, earlier regain of range of movement, less postoperative pain, and improved tendon strength when compared with animals treated with tendon repair alone.","Gersoff, Wayne K; Bozynski, Chantelle C; Cook, Cristi R; Pfeiffer, Ferris M; Kuroki, Keiichi; Cook, James L",The journal of knee surgery,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0038-1646930; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29702719/,239

The objective of this research was to systematically review the published literature about secondary research uses of residual DBS using a scoping review protocol. METHODS A total of 654 publications meeting the inclusion criteria with a 94% interrater reliability were identified. A coding template was created with input from expert advisory board to summarize the data. Electronic literature search of Ovid MEDLINE, Embase (via Embase.com), CINAHL (EBSCO),and Science and Social Sciences Citation Indices (via Web of Science) was conducted. RESULTS A large proportion of the secondary research with DBS was conducted within the United States (30%). The number of published studies utilizing DBS are increasing each year, primarily with observational or case-control designs. Only a small number of studies reported whether or not consent was obtained and if the DBS were identifiable or not. CONCLUSION Outcomes of this research indicate that residual DBS are well utilized worldwide for research addressing individual and public health issues. Future analyses will summarize outcomes of disease-specific research and provide evidence of the use of residual DBS in research on health outcomes.","Rothwell, Erin; Johnson, Erin; Riches, Naomi; Botkin, Jeffrey R",Genetics in medicine : official journal of the American College of Medical Genetics,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41436-018-0387-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30531811/,239

However, data supporting their economic impact is lacking. This study evaluated the effect of an ERP on costs of lung resection. METHODS Adult patients undergoing elective lung resection from August 2011 to August 2013 at a single university-affiliated institution were prospectively recruited. Pneumonectomies and extended resections were excluded. Beginning in September 2012, patients were enrolled in a multimodal ERP. Outcomes were recorded until 90 days after discharge. Total costs from institutional, health care system, and societal perspectives are reported in 2016 Canadian dollars, with uncertainty expressed as 95% confidence intervals derived using bootstrapped estimates (10,000 repetitions). RESULTS The study included 133 patients (conventional care: n = 58; ERP: n = 75). Patient and operative characteristics were similar between the groups. The ERP group had shorter median (interquartile range) length of stay (4 [3 to 6] days vs 6 [4 to 9] days, p < 0.01), decreased total complications (32% vs 52%, p = 0.02), and decreased pulmonary complications (16% vs 34%, p = 0.01), with no difference in readmissions. After discharge, there was a trend towards less caregiver burden for the ERP group (53 ± 90 hours vs 101 ± 252 hours, p = 0.17). Overall societal costs were lower in the ERP group (mean difference per patient: -$4,396 Canadian; 95% confidence interval -$8,674 to $618 Canadian). CONCLUSIONS A multidisciplinary ERP is associated with improved clinical outcomes and societal cost savings compared with conventional perioperative management for elective lung resection.","Paci, Philippe; Madani, Amin; Lee, Lawrence; Mata, Juan; Mulder, David S; Spicer, Jonathan; Ferri, Lorenzo E; Feldman, Liane S",The Annals of thoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2017.05.085; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28778343/,239

MATERIALS AND METHODS Thirty-nine patients who underwent RF ablation for focal hepatic lesions adjacent to the gallbladder (≤ 10 mm) were evaluated retrospectively from January 2011 to December 2014 (30 men and 9 women; age range, 51-85 y; mean age, 65 y). Of 36 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, 3 had a second treatment for recurrence (mean tumor size, 15 mm ± 6). Patients were divided into 2 subgroups based on lesion distance from the gallbladder: nonabutting (> 5 mm; n = 19) and abutting (≤ 5 mm; n = 20). Electrodes were inserted parallel to the gallbladder through the center of a tumor in the nonabutting group and through the center of the expected ablation zone between a 5-mm safety zone on the liver side and the gallbladder in the abutting group. Ablation time was decreased in proportion to the transverse diameter of the expected ablation zone. RESULTS Technical success and technical effectiveness rates were 89.7% and 97.4%, respectively, with no significant differences between groups (P = 1.00). Local tumor progression was observed in 3 patients (1 in the nonabutting group and 2 in the abutting group; P = 1.00). There were no major complications. The gallbladder was thickened in 10 patients, with no significant difference between groups (P = .72). Biloma occurred in 1 patient in the nonabutting group.

92644,Viral aetiology and clinical outcomes in hospitalised infants presenting with respiratory distress.,2014,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is increasingly popular with surgeons because of its apparent technical ease. However, performing LSG safely is sometimes not possible during laparoscopy. The objectives of the present study were to (i) describe the context of LSG failure and (ii) suggest preoperative care options or strategies that enable secondary LSG to be performed safely. METHODS We studied patients having undergone primary and secondary LSG between January 2008 and July 2013. The primary efficacy criterion was the LSG success rate. The secondary efficacy criteria were preoperative care procedures, the complication rate, the failure rate, and the frequency of conversion to open surgery. RESULTS During the study period, 954 patients underwent first- or second-line LSG. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy was technically impossible in 12 patients (1.2 %). The cause of failure was a large left liver lobe in seven cases (58.3 %) and a lack of space in five cases. Of these 12 patients, nine underwent secondary LSG. The median preoperative BMI before the first LSG was 51.5 kg/m(2). The median (range) time interval between the two LSG attempts was 6 months (3-37). Prior to secondary LSG, the preoperative weight reduction measure was a diet in seven cases (78 %), an intragastric balloon in one case, and no treatment in one case. The median preoperative excess weight loss (EWL) before the second LSG was 10 % (0-20). Five LSGs were successful, two required conversion to open surgery, and two failed again. There were two postoperative complications (22 %), both of which concerned the two patients with conversion to laparotomy. CONCLUSIONS In the event of LSG technical failure, preoperative weight loss may enable a second attempt at laparoscopic treatment. A preoperative EWL of at least 10 % appears to be required for the avoidance of conversion to laparotomy.","Rebibo, Lionel; Dhahri, Abdennaceur; Verhaeghe, Pierre; Regimbeau, Jean-Marc",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-014-1320-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24952633/,239
92849,[Influenza Vaccination in Patients with Cardiovascular Disease Under 65 in the COVID-19 Era].,2020-01-07,"Importance In communities with high rates of coronavirus disease 2019, reports have emerged of children with an unusual syndrome of fever and inflammation. Objectives To describe the clinical and laboratory characteristics of hospitalized children who met criteria for the pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (PIMS-TS) and compare these characteristics with other pediatric inflammatory disorders. Design, Setting, and Participants Case series of 58 children from 8 hospitals in England admitted between March 23 and May 16, 2020, with persistent fever and laboratory evidence of inflammation meeting published definitions for PIMS-TS. The final date of follow-up was May 22, 2020. Clinical and laboratory characteristics were abstracted by medical record review, and were compared with clinical characteristics of patients with Kawasaki disease (KD) (n = 1132), KD shock syndrome (n = 45), and toxic shock syndrome (n = 37) who had been admitted to hospitals in Europe and the US from 2002 to 2019. Exposures Signs and symptoms and laboratory and imaging findings of children who met definitional criteria for PIMS-TS from the UK, the US, and World Health Organization. Main Outcomes and Measures Clinical, laboratory, and imaging characteristics of children meeting definitional criteria for PIMS-TS, and comparison with the characteristics of other pediatric inflammatory disorders. Results Fifty-eight children (median age, 9 years [interquartile range {IQR}, 5.7-14]; 33 girls [57%]) were identified who met the criteria for PIMS-TS. Results from SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction tests were positive in 15 of 58 patients (26%) and SARS-CoV-2 IgG test results were positive in 40 of 46 (87%). In total, 45 of 58 patients (78%) had evidence of current or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. All children presented with fever and nonspecific symptoms, including vomiting (26/58 [45%]), abdominal pain (31/58 [53%]), and diarrhea (30/58 [52%]). Rash was present in 30 of 58 (52%), and conjunctival injection in 26 of 58 (45%) cases. Laboratory evaluation was consistent with marked inflammation, for example, C-reactive protein (229 mg/L [IQR, 156-338], assessed in 58 of 58) and ferritin (610 μg/L [IQR, 359-1280], assessed in 53 of 58). Of the 58 children, 29 developed shock (with biochemical evidence of myocardial dysfunction) and required inotropic support and fluid resuscitation (including 23/29 [79%] who received mechanical ventilation); 13 met the American Heart Association definition of KD, and 23 had fever and inflammation without features of shock or KD. Eight patients (14%) developed coronary artery dilatation or aneurysm. Comparison of PIMS-TS with KD and with KD shock syndrome showed differences in clinical and laboratory features, including older age (median age, 9 years [IQR, 5.7-14] vs 2.7 years [IQR, 1.4-4.7] and 3.8 years [IQR, 0.2-18], respectively), and greater elevation of inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (median, 229 mg/L [IQR 156-338] vs 67 mg/L [IQR, 40-150 mg/L] and 193 mg/L [IQR, 83-237], respectively). Conclusions and Relevance In this case series of hospitalized children who met criteria for PIMS-TS, there was a wide spectrum of presenting signs and symptoms and disease severity, ranging from fever and inflammation to myocardial injury, shock, and development of coronary artery aneurysms. The comparison with patients with KD and KD shock syndrome provides insights into this syndrome, and suggests this disorder differs from other pediatric inflammatory entities.","Whittaker, Elizabeth; Bamford, Alasdair; Kenny, Julia; Kaforou, Myrsini; Jones, Christine E; Shah, Priyen; Ramnarayan, Padmanabhan; Fraisse, Alain; Miller, Owen; Davies, Patrick; Kucera, Filip; Brierley, Joe; McDougall, Marilyn; Carter, Michael; Tremoulet, Adriana; Shimizu, Chisato; Herberg, Jethro; Burns, Jane C; Lyall, Hermione; Levin, Michael",JAMA,https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2020.10369; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32511692/,239

93215,Systematic review of the effects of acute stress in binge eating disorder.,2018,"RATIONALE Considerable morbidity and disease progression in people with cystic fibrosis (CF) result from pulmonary exacerbations (PEx). PEx guidelines note insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the concomitant use of inhaled and IV antibiotics. OBJECTIVES We hypothesize that the addition of inhaled antibiotics for PEx therapy is associated with improvements in lung function and a longer time to next PEx compared with standard IV antibiotics alone. METHODS Retrospective cohort study using the CF Foundation Patient Registry-Pediatric Health Information System linked dataset. People with CF were included if hospitalized for PEx from 2006-2016 and 6-21 years of age. Lung function outcomes were assessed by linear mixed effect modeling and generalized estimating equations. Time to next PEx was assessed by Cox proportional hazards regression. To estimate independent causal effects while accounting for indication bias and other confounders, inverse probabilities of treatment weights were calculated based on covariates thought to influence the likelihood of inhaled antibiotic use during PEx treatment. RESULTS 3,253 children and adolescents contributed 9,040 PEx events for analysis. Inhaled antibiotics were used in 23% of PEx events but were not associated with better pre- to post-PEx ppFEV1 responses (mean difference -1.11%, [95% CI -1.83, -0.38]; p=0.003), higher odds of returning to lung function baseline (odds ratio 0.94, [0.82, 1.07]; p=0.34), or longer time to next PEx (hazard ratio 1.05, [0.99, 1.12]; p=0.098). CONCLUSIONS The addition of inhaled antibiotics to standard IV antibiotic PEx treatment was not associated with improved lung function outcomes or a longer time to next PEx.","Cogen, Jonathan D; Faino, Anna V; Onchiri, Frankline; Hoffman, Lucas R; Kronman, Matthew P; Nelson, Maria; Nichols, David P; Rosenfeld, Margaret; VanDevanter, Donald R; Gibson, Ronald L",Annals of the American Thoracic Society,https://doi.org/10.1513/annalsats.202002-179oc; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32726564/,239

Many questions remain about the efficacy and impect of preventive measures because most existing studies report imprecise proxies of influenza incidence, do not follow subjects throughout the entire influenza season and across multiple influenza seasons, or do not control for important factors such as timing of implementation and social contact patterns. Modeling and simulation are key methodologies to answer questions regarding influenza prevention. While vaccination may be the most efficacious existing intervention, variations in circulating strains and children's immune systems keep current vaccines from being fully protective, necessitating further clinical and economic studies and technology improvements. Hand hygiene appears to be an important adjunct but improving compliance, standardizing regimens and quantifying its impact remain challenging. Future studies should help better define the specific indications and circumstances for antiviral use and the role of nutritional supplements and nonpharmaceutical interventions.","Lee, Bruce Y; Shah, Mirat",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,https://doi.org/10.1586/eri.12.106; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23199400/,239

STUDY DESIGN Consecutive patients aged <18 years (n = 1000) undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy were enrolled prospectively. Biopsy specimens were obtained from IPs and the proximal and distal esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. Multichannel intraluminal impedance and pH monitoring (MII-pH) was performed in all symptomatic patients. Symptomatic patients were treated with proton pump inhibitors for 8 weeks, and IP ablation by argon plasma coagulation (APC) was performed in unresponsive patients. RESULTS The endoscopic incidence of IP was 6.3%, with a cumulative missing rate of 5.8%. Thirty-five of the 63 patients (56%) were asymptomatic, 11 (17%) had symptoms clearly related to the underlying digestive disorder, and 17 (27%) had chronic IP-related symptoms. MII-pH was positive in 10 of the 28 symptomatic patients. All 17 patients with IP-related symptoms were unresponsive to proton pump inhibitors and were treated with APC, and all had achieved complete remission by the 3-year follow-up. Patients with underlying disorders were successfully treated with medical therapy, and asymptomatic patients remained symptom-free, with no endoscopic or histological changes seen at the 3-year follow-up. CONCLUSION IP is an under-recognized cause of symptoms in children with unexplained esophageal and respiratory symptoms. MII-pH and bioptic sampling are needed to exclude entities mimicking IP symptoms and to direct therapy. APC is safe and effective for treating IP-related symptoms.","Di Nardo, Giovanni; Cremon, Cesare; Bertelli, Luca; Oliva, Salvatore; De Giorgio, Roberto; Pagano, Nico",The Journal of pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2016.05.059; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27318379/,239

Also to categorize these changes and to quantitatively and qualitatively correlate their reflectivity levels with visual function. METHODS We manually segmented the borders, and depicted relative intensity of the inner segment ellipsoid band, and quantified the volume of edema. RESULTS The average relative intensity of the ellipsoid zone, ISe band, for the control subject was 14.864, our patient's, with the mild disease was, 28.238 and 34.943 in OD and OS, respectively, and for the patient with severe disease was, 44.442 and 40.154 for OD and OS respectively. Thresholding showed a significant difference in edema volume between mild disease (~20%), and severe form (~50%). Relative intensity analyses are indicative of homogeneity variability. High standard deviation value illustrates the high dispersion of data values and is a safe marker of ellipsoid zone homogeneity. CONCLUSION Data suggested that both anatomic and functional characteristic of outer macula hyperreflective bands were notably associated with the pathogenesis cascade in the photoreceptor cells. External limiting membrane line disruption is initiated by the volume of macular edema and followed by disorganization of the three lines in a stepwise pattern, first at the ellipsoid zone, followed by the cone outer segment tips zone and finally at the External limiting membrane.","Christodoulou, Panayiotis D",European journal of ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1177/1120672121995110; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594896/,239

A Systematic Review.,2021-09-14,"Ly49Q is an ITIM-bearing MHC class I receptor that is highly expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). Ly49Q is required for the TLR9-mediated IFN-I production in pDCs, although the mechanism is not fully understood. We here demonstrate that Ly49Q protects pDCs from pyroptotic cell death induced by CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG). In the Ly49Q-deficient (Klra17-/-) mouse spleen, the number of ssDNA-positive pDCs increased significantly after CpG treatment, strongly suggesting that Klra17-/- pDCs were susceptible to CpG-induced cell death. In Klra17-/- bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs), CpG-induced cell death was accompanied by increased cathepsin B leakage from the vesicular compartments into the cytoplasm. Concurrently, IL-1β secretion increased in the CpG-treated Klra17-/- BMDCs, strongly suggesting that the CpG-induced cell death in these cells is pyroptotic in nature. Consistent with these observations, inhibiting cathepsin B or caspase 1 in CpG-stimulated Klra17-/- BMDCs reversed the increase in cell death. Pyroptotic cell death and IL-1β secretion were also observed in BMDCs derived from transgenic mice expressing an ITIM-less Ly49Q (Ly49Q-YF Tg). CpG also increased the IL-1β production and cell death in B2m-/- BMDCs. These results suggest that Ly49Q and MHC class I play important roles for protecting pyroptosis-like cell death of DCs by influencing lysosome state.","Sasawatari, Shigemi; Karyu, Hitomi; Nguyen Tien, Dat; Furuyama-Tanaka, Kaori; Toyama-Sorimachi, Noriko",Molecular immunology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2021.03.023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33932686/,239

98270,Resuming Elective Orthopaedic Surgery During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Guidelines Developed by the International Consensus Group (ICM).,2020-05-14,"Adaptation of RNA viruses to a new host or vector species often results in emergence of new viral lineages. However, lineage-specific restrictions on the adaptive processes remain largely unexplored. Recently, a Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) lineage of African origin emerged to cause major epidemics of severe, persistent, debilitating arthralgia in Africa and Asia. Surprisingly, this new lineage is actively replacing endemic strains in Southeast Asia that have been circulating there for 60 y. This replacement process is associated with adaptation of the invasive CHIKV strains to an atypical vector, the Aedes albopictus mosquito that is ubiquitously distributed in the region. Here we demonstrate that lineage-specific epistatic interactions between substitutions at amino acid positions 226 and 98 of the E1 envelope glycoprotein, the latter of which likely resulted from a founder effect, have for 60 y restricted the ability of endemic Asian CHIKV strains to adapt to this new vector. This adaptive constraint appears to be allowing invasion of the unoccupied vector niche by Ae. albopictus-adapted African strains. These results underscore how different adaptive landscapes occupied by closely related viral genotypes can profoundly affect the outcome of viral evolution and disease emergence.","Tsetsarkin, Konstantin A; Chen, Rubing; Leal, Grace; Forrester, Naomi; Higgs, Stephen; Huang, Jing; Weaver, Scott C",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1018344108; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21518887/,239

99105,Letter to the Editor: Does an Antimicrobial Incision Drape Prevent Intraoperative Contamination? A Randomized Controlled Trial of 1187 Patients.,2020-06-16,"BACKGROUND In atopic dermatitis (AD), some studies have shown an association with increased cardiovascular disease in certain populations. However, other investigations found modest or no association. Despite conflicting results, molecular profiling studies in both AD skin and blood have demonstrated upregulation of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular risk-related markers. However, the underlying mechanisms connecting AD to vascular inflammation/atherosclerosis are unknown. In this study, we aim to determine factors associated with vascular inflammation/atherosclerosis in AD patients. METHODS We used 18-FDG PET-CT to characterize vascular inflammation in AD patients and healthy subjects. In parallel, we assessed their skin and blood immune profiles to determine AD-related immune biomarkers associated with vascular inflammation. We also assessed levels of circulating microparticles, which are known to be associated withincreased cardiovascular risk. RESULTS We found significant correlations between vascular inflammation and Th2-related products in skin and blood of AD patientsas well as atherosclerosis-related markers thatwere modulated by dupilumab. Circulating levels of endothelial microparticles were significantly higher in severe AD patients and tended to correlate with vascular inflammation assessed by PET-CT. CONCLUSION Vascular inflammation in AD is associated with enhanced Th2 response and clinical severity, which may explain cardiovascular comorbidities observed in select AD populations.Larger prospective studies are needed to further evaluate vascular inflammation and cardiovascular events and mortality in AD patients. Finally, as dupilumab treatment demonstrated significant modulation of atherosclerosis-related genes in AD patients compared to placebo, these data suggest that modulation of vascular inflammation with systemic treatment should be explored in patients with AD.","Villani, Axel P; Pavel, Ana B; Wu, Jianni; Fernandes, Marie; Maari, Catherine; Saint-Cyr Proulx, Etienne; Jack, Carolyn; Glickman, Jacob; SeulahChoi,; He, Helen; Ungar, Benjamin; Estrada, Yeriel; Kameyama, Naoya; Zhang, Ning; Gonzales, Juana; Tardif, Jean-Claude; Krueger, James G; Bissonnette, Robert; Guttman-Yassky, Emma",Allergy,https://doi.org/10.1111/all.14859; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33866573/,239

MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively identified 146 patients preoperatively diagnosed with early gastric cancer who underwent five-port laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (FP-LDG) or TP-LDG between May 2013 and July 2016. A propensity score matching analysis was used to create patient groups (48 patients in each group) matched for sex, age, body mass index, previous abdominal surgery history, and American Society of Anesthesiologist score. The short-term surgical outcomes between TP-LDG and FP-LDG were compared. RESULTS The TP-LDG group had a statistically shorter umbilical wound length [3.4 (range, 3.0-4.0) cm vs. 3.9 (range, 3.7-4.0) cm, p = .000], shorter operative time [230 (range, 190-310) min vs. 250 (range, 180-320) min, p = .036], and lower estimated blood loss [68 (range, 20-180) mL vs. 80 (range, 40-150) mL, p = .005] compared to that in the FP-LDG group. However, there was no specific superiority regarding inflammatory profiles. Complication rates were also similar (8.4% TP-LDG vs. 12.6% FP-LDG, p = .504).

Using a questionnaire, we documented 13 episodes of microbial collection destruction involving viral, bacterial, and fungal strains, which we believe is almost certainly an underestimate of the number of collections destroyed. In every case, the motivation for the destruction of the collection was a desire to avoid the perceived burdens of the regulatory environment associated with operating under the Select Agent Regulations. Some institutions that destroyed isolates considered, and in some cases tried, transferring their collections to registered institutions prior to collection destruction but desisted when confronted with transport regulations. Destruction of microbial collections represents a loss of strains and biological diversity available for biomedical research and future mechanistic, forensic, and epidemiologic investigations. Given the rapid evolution of microbial strains, the destruction of archival collections is a potentially irretrievable loss that was an unintended consequence of regulations to protect society against the nefarious use of biological agents. Furthermore, unregistered institutions continue to destroy newly acquired clinical isolates, thus preventing the establishment of new repository collections. We recommend that government agencies develop plans to ensure that microbial collections are preserved when considering future additions to microbial threat lists under which the possession of certain microbes is criminalized.","Casadevall, Arturo; Imperiale, Michael J","Biosecurity and bioterrorism : biodefense strategy, practice, and science",https://doi.org/10.1089/bsp.2010.0012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20569056/,239

These stents usually pass spontaneously, but they can be retained and, rarely, this may cause biliary obstruction. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this paper is twofold: to describe the appearance of biliary tract obstruction caused by retained surgical stents in pediatric liver transplants, and to report how these stents can be removed using interventional radiology techniques. MATERIALS AND METHODS Three pediatric patients presenting with biochemical and imaging evidence of biliary obstruction were encountered over a 6-month period. At percutaneous cholangiography all patients were found to have retained surgical stents which appeared to be causing biliary tract obstruction. Percutaneous snaring of the stents was undertaken. RESULTS All stents were successfully removed using interventional radiology techniques, and follow-up showed no evidence of recurrent obstruction. CONCLUSION Surgical stents in children undergoing hepaticojejunostomy may be retained and cause biliary obstruction. Radiologists involved with imaging these patients should be aware of this potential cause of biliary obstruction. This complication is amenable to interventional radiology techniques with good long-term results. There is no easy endoscopic or surgical treatment option in these patients.","Crowley, John J; Zajko, Albert B; Fitz, Charles R; Soltys, Kyle A; Paredes, Jose L; Mattiola, Vincent V",Pediatric radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00247-014-3144-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25145452/,239

Studies exploring the mental health implications of these disparities have only just begun to emerge. The purpose of this study is to better understand mental health concerns and test whether social determinants of health and COVID-19-related experiences influence these concerns. In April 2020, we launched a community-based survey for adults across the United States. A total of 341 respondents completed the survey, which included questions about demographics, depression, social isolation, work environment, and preexisting mental health conditions. We generated matched controls by adding county data from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to our survey. Chi square, Pearson product-moment correlation, point biserial correlation, and logistic regression were estimated. Our analysis revealed that respondents who identified as Latinx, Latin@, or Hispanic were 10 times more likely to meet the threshold score for depression. Similarly, individuals with prior mental health conditions and those who expressed feelings of social isolation due to COVID-19 were 3 times more likely to meet the threshold score for depression. These results confirm our hypothesis that communities of color will likely experience disproportionate mental health impacts of COVID-19-specifically, the mental health sequela that emerge from exposure, cumulative burden, and social isolation. We discuss the implications for expanding access and quality of health and mental health services to address current inequities.","Saltzman, Leia Y; Lesen, Amy E; Henry, Veronica; Hansel, Tonya C; Bordnick, Patrick S",Health security,https://doi.org/10.1089/hs.2021.0017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34014118/,239

We conducted this study to demonstrate the feasibility of this procedure for upper rectal cancer. METHODS A total of 184 patients with upper rectal cancer were retrospectively analyzed in our cancer center between April 2010 and April 2017. These patients were treated with either laparoscopic TSME (n = 46) or laparoscopic total mesorectal excision (TME) (n = 138). In the TSME group, the left colonic artery and superior rectal artery were preserved while they were not in the TME group. RESULTS The operation time in the TSME group was longer than that in the TME group (218.56 ± 35.85 min vs. 201.13 ± 42.65 min, P = 0.004). Furthermore, the number of resected lymph nodes in the TSME group was greater than that in the TME group (19.43 ± 9.46 vs. 18.03 ± 7.43, P = 0.024). The blood loss between the TSME and TME groups was not significant. No mortality occurred in either the TSME or TME groups. One patient in the TME group underwent conversion to laparotomy. The total postoperative complication rates in the TSME and TME groups were 8.7% and 17.4%, respectively. There was no difference in severe complications between the two groups (anastomotic leakage and stenosis). CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic TSME preserving the left colic artery and superior rectal artery can be safely conducted for upper rectal cancer.","Zhang, Chi; Wei, Hao-Tang; Hu, Wenqing; Sun, Yueming; Zhang, Qinyuan; Abe, Masanobu; Du, Zhuoran; Xu, Yingying; Zong, Liang; Hu, Xiang",World journal of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12957-020-01986-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32811501/,239

OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of interventions to improve routine health information systems in terms of RHIS performance, and also, in terms of improved health system management performance, and improved patient and population health outcomes. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE Ovid and Embase Ovid in May 2019. We searched Global Health, Ovid and PsycInfo in April 2016. In January 2020 we searched for grey literature in the Grey Literature Report and in OpenGrey, and for ongoing trials using the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov. In October 2019 we also did a cited reference search using Web of Science, and a 'similar articles' search in PubMed. SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised and non-randomised trials, controlled before-after studies and time-series studies comparing routine health information system interventions, with controls, in primary, hospital or community health care settings. Participants included clinical staff and management, district management and community health workers using routine information systems. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two authors independently reviewed records to identify studies for inclusion, extracted data from the included studies and assessed the risk of bias. Interventions and outcomes were too varied across studies to allow for pooled risk analysis. We present a 'Summary of findings' table for each intervention comparisons broadly categorised into Technical and Organisational (or a combination), and report outcomes on data quality and service quality. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence. MAIN RESULTS We included six studies: four cluster randomised trials and two controlled before-after studies, from Africa and South America. Three studies evaluated technical interventions, one study evaluated an organisational intervention, and two studies evaluated a combination of technical and organisational interventions. Four studies reported on data quality and six studies reported on service quality. In terms of data quality, a web-based electronic TB laboratory information system probably reduces the length of time to reporting of TB test results, and probably reduces the overall rate of recording errors of TB test results, compared to a paper-based system (moderate certainty evidence). We are uncertain about the effect of the electronic laboratory information system on the recording rate of serious (misidentification) errors for TB test results compared to a paper-based system (very low certainty evidence). Misidentification errors are inaccuracies in transferring test results between an electronic register and patients' clinical charts. We are also uncertain about the effect of the intervention on service quality (timeliness of starting or changing a patient's TB treatment) (very low certainty evidence). A hand-held electronic device probably improves the length of time to report TB test results, and probably reduces the total frequency of recording errors in TB test results between the laboratory notebook and the electronic information record system, compared to a paper-based system (moderate-certainty evidence). We are, however, uncertain about the effect of the intervention on the frequency of serious (misidentification) errors in recording between the laboratory notebook and the electronic information record, compared to a paper-based system (very low certainty evidence). We are uncertain about the effect of a hospital electronic health information system on service quality (length of time outpatients spend at hospital, length of hospital stay, and hospital revenue collection), compared to a paper-based system (very low certainty evidence). High-intensity brief text messaging (SMS) may make little or no difference to data quality (in terms of completeness of documentation of pregnancy outcomes), compared to low-intensity brief text messaging (low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain about the effect of electronic drug stock notification (with either data management support or product transfer support) on service quality (in terms of transporting stock and stock levels), compared to paper-based stock notification (very low certainty evidence). We are uncertain about the effect of health information strengthening (where it is part of comprehensive service quality improvement intervention) on service quality (health worker motivation, receipt of training by health workers, health information index scores, quality of clinical observation of children and adults) (very low certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS The review indicates mixed effects of mainly technical interventions to improve data quality, with gaps in evidence on interventions aimed at enhancing data-informed health system management. There is a gap in interventions studying information support beyond clinical management, such as for human resources, finances, drug supply and governance. We need to have a better understanding of the causal mechanisms by which information support may affect change in management decision-making, to inform robust intervention design and evaluation methods.","Leon, Natalie; Balakrishna, Yusentha; Hohlfeld, Ameer; Odendaal, Willem A; Schmidt, Bey-Marrié; Zweigenthal, Virginia; Anstey Watkins, Jocelyn; Daniels, Karen",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd012012.pub2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803893/,239

113618,Aerosol Generation During Peak Flow Testing: Clinical Implications for COVID-19.,2021-05-25,"INTRODUCTION Obesity is a known risk factor for the development and prognosis of breast cancer. Adipocytes have been identified as a source of exogenous lipids in other cancer types and may similarly provide energy to fuel malignant survival and growth in breast cancer. This relationship is of particular relevance to plastic surgery, because many reconstructions after oncologic mastectomy achieve optimal aesthetics and durability using adjunctive autologous fat transfer (AFT). Despite the increasing ubiquity and promise of AFT, many unanswered questions remain, including safety in the setting of breast cancer. Clinical studies to examine this question are underway, but an in vitro system is critical to elucidate the complex interplay between the cells that normally reside at the surgical recipient site. To study these interactions and characterize possible lipid transfer between adipocytes to breast cancer cells, we designed a 3-dimensional in vitro model using primary patient-derived tissues. METHODS Breast adipose tissue was acquired from patients undergoing breast reduction surgery. The tissue was enzymatically digested and sorted to retrieve adipocytes and adipose stromal cells. Polydimethylsiloxane wells were filled with type I collagen-encapsulated adipocytes labeled with the fluorescent lipid dye boron dipyrromethene, as well as unlabeled adipose stromal cells. A monolayer of red fluorescently labeled MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells was seeded on the surface of the construct. Lipid transfer at the interface between adipocytes and breast cancer cells was analyzed. RESULTS Confocal microscopy revealed a dense culture of native adipocytes containing fluorescent lipid droplets in the 3-dimensional collagen culture platform. RFP-positive breast cancer cells were found in close proximity to lipid-laden adipocytes. Lipid transfer from adipocytes to breast cancer cells was observed by the presence of boron dipyrromethene-positive lipid droplets within RFP-labeled breast cancer cells. CONCLUSION We have established a 3-dimensional model to study complex breast cancer-adipose tissue interactions. Direct transfer of fluorescently labeled lipids from adipocytes to breast cancer cells may indicate aberrant metabolism to fuel malignant growth and adaptive survival. Our novel platform can untangle the complex interplay within the breast cancer tumor microenvironment for high-throughput analysis and better elucidate the safety of AFT in postoncologic mastectomy.","Toyoda, Yoshiko; Celie, Karel-Bart; Xu, Jonathan T; Buro, Justin S; Jin, Julia; Lin, Alexandra J; Brown, Kristy A; Spector, Jason A",Annals of plastic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sap.0000000000001364; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29481479/,239

Various ligand-polymer blend compositions with commercial PLA (from 2% to 100%) were evaluated. Labeling efficiencies over 95% were achieved in a 5 min reaction using 100% of the ligand-polymer or within 15 min using a 5% ligand-polymer blend. The addition of 1.5% of PEGylated copolymer to the blend did not affect the labeling efficiency of these particles but changed their in vivo behavior. MicroSPECT/CT imaging showed significant uptake of non-PEGylated microspheres by the murine lung, while only the liver and spleen took up PEGylated microspheres. Such (99m)Tc radiolabeled biodegradable microspheres will be useful diagnostic imaging agents for visualization of the functioning reticuloendothelial system (RES).

114056,Factors Predicting Meniscal Allograft Transplantation Failure.,2016,"Background The neuropsychiatric disorders due to post-streptococcal autoimmune complications such as Sydenham's chorea (SC) are associated with acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease (ARF/RHD). An animal model that exhibits characteristics of both cardiac and neurobehavioral defects in ARF/RHD would be an important adjunct for future studies. Since age, gender, strain differences, and genotypes impact on the development of autoimmunity, we investigated the behavior of male and female Wistar and Lewis rat strains in two age cohorts (<6 weeks and >12 weeks) under normal husbandry conditions and following exposure to group A streptococcus (GAS). Methods Standard behavioral assessments were performed to determine the impairments in fine motor control (food manipulation test), gait and balance (beam walking test), and obsessive-compulsive behavior (grooming and marble burying tests). Furthermore, electrocardiography, histology, and behavioral assessments were performed on male and female Lewis rats injected with GAS antigens. Results For control Lewis rats there were no significant age and gender dependent differences in marble burying, food manipulation, beam walking and grooming behaviors. In contrast significant age-dependent differences were observed in Wistar rats in all the behavioral tests except for food manipulation. Therefore, Lewis rats were selected for further experiments to determine the effect of GAS. After exposure to GAS, Lewis rats demonstrated neurobehavioral abnormalities and cardiac pathology akin to SC and ARF/RHD, respectively. Conclusion We have characterised a new model that provides longitudinal stability of age-dependent behavior, to simultaneously investigate both neurobehavioral and cardiac abnormalities associated with post-streptococcal complications.","Rafeek, Rukshan A M; Lobbe, Catherine M; Wilkinson, Ethan C; Hamlin, Adam S; Andronicos, Nicholas M; McMillan, David J; Sriprakash, Kadaba S; Ketheesan, Natkunam",Animal models and experimental medicine,https://doi.org/10.1002/ame2.12164; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34179722/,239

This impact was investigated after the flood event in July 2018 on 11 river reaches where the river engineering and management intervention was applied. We analyzed its impact by spatio-temporal variations in river morphology (12 channel parameters) and changes in cross-section and hydraulic parameters (flow velocity, shear stress, stream power, W/D ratio) between pre- and post-flood management periods. The research hypotheses related to decreasing geodiversity in managed river reaches, a rapid increase in flow velocity during an extreme flood in river reaches where there is no sufficient floodplain inundation due to artificially high banks built by river training works, and increasing erosive force in the channel zone thanks to river management intervention were confirmed. The intervention in the braidplain area of the Belá River resulted in an undesirable simplification of the river pattern, loss of geomorphic diversity, loss of channel-floodplain connectivity, and disturbance and restraint of hydromorphological continuity. Identification of main conflicts of the Belá River management is important for clarifying the different approaches of stakeholders in the study area and aims to provide an objective illustration of their consequences. The presented analyses could help in future management issues as well as in the more critical decision-making process in vulnerable and rare braided river systems on the present when we are losing so many natural rivers by human decisions.","Kidová, Anna; Radecki-Pawlik, Artur; Rusnák, Miloš; Plesiński, Karol",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85805-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33737703/,239
115771,Endotracheal Tube Seal and Suction Performance in a Novel Biorealistic Tracheal Model.,2015,"The Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) GP64 protein mediates membrane fusion during entry. Fusion results from a low-pH-triggered conformational change in GP64 and subsequent interactions with the membrane bilayers. The low-pH sensor and trigger of the conformational change are not known, but histidine residues are implicated because the pK(a) of histidine is near the threshold for triggering fusion by GP64. We used alanine substitutions to examine the roles of all individual and selected clusters of GP64 histidine residues in triggering and mediating fusion by GP64. Three histidine residues (H152, H155, and H156), located in fusion loop 2, were identified as important for membrane fusion. These three histidine residues were important for efficient pore expansion but were not required for the pH-triggered conformational change. In contrast, a cluster of three histidine residues (H245, H304, and H430) located near the base of the central coiled coil was identified as a putative sensor for low pH. Three alanine substitutions in cluster H245/H304/H430 resulted in dramatically reduced membrane fusion and the apparent loss of the prefusion conformation at neutral pH. Thus, the H245/H304/H430 cluster of histidines may function or participate as a pH sensor by stabilizing the prefusion structure of GP64.","Li, Zhaofei; Blissard, Gary W",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.05153-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21937651/,239

The year 2020 started full of promise as many organizations anticipated assessing themselves using perfect, or 2020, vision. While challenging on several levels, the momentous combination of events in 2020-the COVID-19 pandemic, Racial Justice Movement, and the November elections-provided Geriatric Medicine several opportunities to firmly secure a position in the mainstream. As we reflect on the new perspectives, programs, and partnerships initiated in 2020, five broader lessons emerge that can help safeguard the future of Geriatrics: the field could employ more intentional ""direct to consumer"" marketing strategies, expand the scope of what it means to be a patient advocate, pursue new strategic partnerships, take the opportunity to address racial injustice, and leverage existing skillsets to expand scope of care for patients. Given the interdisciplinary nature of Geriatrics, it is fitting that many of these lessons build upon this collaborative philosophy and are derived from domains outside of health care. So in an unexpected way, the events of 2020 may actually help Geriatrics see, with 2020 vision, how to remain mainstream.

The certainty of the evidence, resources, and other factors were fully considered, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to rate the certainty of evidence and the strength of recommendations. RESULTS The first version of this living guidance focuses on patients who are mild or moderate COVID-19. A multidisciplinary guideline development panel was established. Ten clinical questions were identified based on the status of evidence and a face-to-face experts' consensus. Finally, nine recommendations were reached consensus, and were formulated from systematic reviews of the benefits and harms, certainty of evidence, public accessibility, policy supports, feedback on proposed recommendations from multidisciplinary experts, and consensus meetings. CONCLUSION This guideline panel made nine recommendations, which covered five traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) prescription granules/decoction (MXXFJD, QFPD, XFBD, TJQW, and JWDY), three Chinese patent medicines (LHQW granules/capsule, JHQG granules, and LHQK granules), and one Chinese herbal injection (XBJ injection). Of them, two were strongly recommended (LHQW granules/capsule and QFPD decoction), and five were weakly recommended (MXXFJD decoction, XFBD decoction, JHQG granules, TJQW granules, and JWDY decoction) for the treatment of mild and moderate COVID-19; two were weakly recommended against (XBJ injection and LHQK granules) the treatment of mild and moderate COVID-19. The users of this living guideline are most likely to be clinicians, patients, governments, ministries, and health administrators.","Ge, Long; Zhu, Hongfei; Wang, Qi; Li, Mengting; Cai, Jianxiong; Chen, Yang; Chen, Yaolong; Ding, Banghan; Fang, Bangjiang; Fei, Yutong; Feng, Jihong; Guo, Xinfeng; Jiang, Rongmeng; Jiang, Yuyong; Li, Guiwei; Li, Xiuhui; Li, Xucheng; Liang, Qun; Liu, Jian; Liu, Jianping; Liu, Qingquan; Liu, Shaonan; Lu, Yun; Miao, Qing; Qi, Wensheng; Shang, Hongcai; Shi, Liqing; Tan, XingHua; Tang, Xudong; Wang, Xianbo; Wang, Xiaojun; Xia, Wenguang; Yang, Kehu; Yang, Lihong; Ye, Yongan; Zhou, Qi; Zhang, Hongchun; Zhang, Junhua; Zhang, Zhiming; Zhang, Zhongde; Zou, Xu; Li, Jun; Wu, Darong",Journal of evidence-based medicine,https://doi.org/10.1111/jebm.12444; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34632732/,239
120427,Insights from Italy: the Novara-COVID score for rapid destination of COVID-19 patients at emergency department presentation.,2020-05-14,"Previous work has shown that infants as young as 8 months of age can use certain features of the environment, such as the shape or color of visual stimuli, as cues to organize simple inputs into hierarchical rule structures, a robust form of reinforcement learning that supports generalization of prior learning to new contexts. However, especially in cluttered naturalistic environments, there are an abundance of potential cues that can be used to structure learning into hierarchical rule structures. It is unclear how infants determine what features constitute a higher-order context to organize inputs into hierarchical rule structures. Here we examine whether 9-month-old infants are biased to use social stimuli, relative to non-social stimuli, as a higher-order context to organize learning of simple visuospatial inputs into hierarchical rule sets. Infants were presented with four face/color-target location pairings, which could be learned most simply as individual associations. Alternatively, infants could use the faces or colorful backgrounds as a higher-order context to organize the inputs into simpler color-location or face-location rules, respectively. Infants were then given a generalization test designed to probe how they learned the initial pairings. Results indicated that infants appeared to use the faces as a higher-order context to organize simpler color-location rules, which then supported generalization of learning to new face-contexts. These findings provide new evidence that infants are biased to organize reinforcement learning around social stimuli.","Werchan, Denise; Amso, Dima",Developmental science,https://doi.org/10.1111/desc.13088; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33484594/,239

120817,"A new therapeutic communication model ""TAGEET"" to help nurses engage therapeutically with patients suspected of or confirmed with COVID-19.",2020-12-22,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), the causative agent of PED, belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and autophagy play crucial roles in regulating a variety of cellular processes during viral infection. However, the precise role of autophagy in PEDV-infected Vero cells remains largely elusive. To elucidate how PEDV infection induces autophagy, this study ascertained whether ER stress was present in PEDV-infected Vero cells. The results showed PEDV infection significantly increased the expression of GRP78 and LC3Ⅱ. Treatment with the ER stress inhibitor 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) could significantly inhibit PEDV-induced autophagy. Antioxidants, such as N-acetylcysteine (NAC), could significantly inhibit PEDV-induced ER stress and autophagy, indicating that ROS act as an upstream regulator of ER stress-mediated autophagy. Further research found that activation of ER stress triggered the unfolded protein response (UPR) through PERK, IRE1, and ATF6 pathways during PEDV infection. However, treatment with the PERK inhibitor GSK2606414, IRE1 inhibitor STF-083010 but not ATF6 inhibitor AEBSF reversed PEDV-induced autophagy. Taken together, the results of this study showed that accumulated ROS played an essential role in regulating ER stress-mediated autophagy during PEDV infection. We also found that PERK and IER1 pathways of UPR signalling were involved in PEDV-induced autophagy. Furthermore, PEDV induced autophagy to promote viral replication via PERK and IER1 pathways in Vero cells. These results provide the mechanism of PEDV-induced ROS-dependent ER stress-mediated autophagy in Vero cells through activating PERK and IRE1 pathways.","Sun, Pei; Jin, Jian; Wang, Lixiang; Wang, Jingjing; Zhou, Hongchao; Zhang, Qi; Xu, Xingang",Veterinary microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2020.108959; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33360915/,239
121020,Outcomes of amputation due to long-standing therapy-resistant complex regional pain syndrome type I.,2020-07-30,"OBJECTIVES The authors sought to develop an automated algorithm using pre-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) fractional flow reserve (FFR) pullback recordings to predict post-PCI physiological results in the pre-PCI phase. BACKGROUND Both FFR and percent FFR increase measured after PCI showed incremental prognostic implications. However, there is no current method to predict post-PCI physiological results using physiological assessment in the pre-PCI phase. METHODS An automated algorithm that analyzes instantaneous FFR gradient per unit time (dFFR(t)/dt) was developed from the derivation cohort (n = 30). Using dFFR(t)/dt, the pattern of atherosclerotic disease in each patient was classified into 3 groups (major, mixed, and minor FFR gradient groups) in both the internal validation cohort with constant pullback method (n = 234) and the external validation cohort with nonstandardized pullback methods (n = 252). All patients in the validation cohorts underwent PCI on the basis of pre-PCI FFR ≤0.80. Suboptimal post-PCI physiological results were defined as both post-PCI FFR <0.84 and percent FFR increase ≤15%. From the derivation cohort, cutoffs of dFFR(t)/dt for major and minor FFR gradient were 0.035/s and 0.015/s, respectively. RESULTS In validation cohorts, dFFR(t)/dt showed significant correlations with percent FFR increase (R = 0.801; p < 0.001) and post-PCI FFR (R = 0.099; p = 0.029). In both the internal and external validation cohorts, the major FFR gradient group showed significantly higher post-PCI FFR and percent FFR increase compared with those in the mixed or minor FFR gradient groups (all p values <0.001). The proportions of suboptimal post-PCI physiological results were significantly different among 3 groups (10.4% vs. 25.8% vs. 45.7% for the major, mixed, and minor FFR gradient groups, respectively; p < 0.001) in validation cohorts. Absence of major FFR gradient lesion (odds ratio: 2.435, 95% [CI]: 1.252 to 4.734; p = 0.009) and presence of minor FFR gradient lesion (odds ratio: 2.756, 95% confidence interval: 1.629 to 4.664; p < 0.001) were independent predictors for suboptimal post-PCI physiological results. CONCLUSIONS The automated algorithm analyzing pre-PCI pullback curve was able to predict post-PCI physiological results. The incidence of suboptimal post-PCI physiological results was significantly different according to algorithm-based classifications in the pre-PCI physiological assessment.

123138,Identifying Trends in Patient Characteristics and Visit Details During the Transition to Teledermatology: Experience at a Single Tertiary Referral Center.,2020-11-27,"AIM To provide imaging data and report associations between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), tuberculosis (TB) and pulmonary embolism (PE) in a South African population that underwent computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) for suspected PE. METHODS A validated Qanadli severity scoring system for PE was used for 164 CTPA scans, and parenchymal, pleural and cardiovascular complications were reported. Serological confirmation of HIV testing and microbiological confirmation of TB were recorded. RESULTS Prevalence of PE in the CTPA population was 26% (95% CI: 19.67-33.65%). HIV-positive prevalence in patients with PE was 67% (95% CI: 48.17-82.04%), however it was not statistically significantly different when compared with the patients without PE (p = 1). HIV-positive patients had more extensive partial thrombus in the right middle lobe (p = 0.045), but no other differences when compared with HIV-negative patients. TB prevalence in patients with PE was 57% (95% CI: 34.49-76.81%). This was statistically significantly different when compared with the patients without PE (p = 0.073 at the 10% level). Prevalence of TB co-morbidity in the HIV-positive group with proven PE was 71% (95% CI: 41.90- 91.61%), however there was no statistically significant difference in comparison with the HIV-negative patients with TB and PE (p= 0.305). CONCLUSION The high number of patients presenting for CTPA who were HIV infected (and also infected with TB) highlights that PE evaluation should include severity/extent of the disease, as these patients may have more severe disease in specific lung lobes. The use of a validated scoring system, such as the Qanadli score, when reporting PE may have a profound effect on patient risk stratification, management and prognosis and would also provide a system for collecting larger volumes of data for analysis.","Ramlakhan, Raksha; Andronikou, Savvas; Rajkumar, Ashmitha",Cardiovascular journal of Africa,https://doi.org/10.5830/cvja-2016-083; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28218770/,239

STUDY DESIGN Observational study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY Department of Radiology, Shifa International Hospital, from 1st March to June 30th, 2020. METHODOLOGY One hundred and three consecutive patients' RT PCR positive for COVID-19 were included. Two consultant radiologists, with experience of 7 to 10 years in body imaging, evaluated their HRCT studies in consensus and calculated the CT severity score. A scoring of all 20 individual regions in each lung were assigned by the radiologists attributing a score of 0, 1 or 2 to each region, if parenchymal opacification was none, less than 50%, or 50% or more, respectively. The CT severity score was a summation of scores of all 20 regions of both lungs combined with a range of 0 to 40 points. The scores were compared for clinically mild and severe disease. RESULTS Significant differences were noted regarding the scoring of lung opacity in mild and severe groups in each lung segment, p <0.05. The most significantly involved segments were right lower lobe's medial and lateral basal segment, left upper lobe's superior lingular segment and left lower lobe's medial basal and lateral basal segments. To discriminate mild versus severe disease, CT-SS threshold value turned out to be 19.5 Conclusion: CTSS may be of value for a prompt and objective means of assessing the degree of severity and disease burden in lungs.

Owing to the lack of approved therapies, screening programmes of potentially efficacious drugs have been undertaken. One of these studies has demonstrated the possible utility of chloroquine against EBOV using pseudotyped assays. In mouse models of EBOV disease there are conflicting reports of the therapeutic effects of chloroquine. There are currently no reports of its efficacy using the larger and more stringent guinea pig model of infection. In this study we have shown that replication of live EBOV is impaired by chloroquine in vitro. However, no protective effects were observed in vivo when EBOV-infected guinea pigs were treated with chloroquine. These results advocate that chloroquine should not be considered as a treatment strategy for EBOV.","Dowall, Stuart D; Bosworth, Andrew; Watson, Robert; Bewley, Kevin; Taylor, Irene; Rayner, Emma; Hunter, Laura; Pearson, Geoff; Easterbrook, Linda; Pitman, James; Hewson, Roger; Carroll, Miles W",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/jgv.0.000309; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26459826/,239

124049,Recommendation to Use Wearable-based mHealth in Closed-Loop Management of Acute Cardiovascular Disease Patients during the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2021-02-17,"Background The novel surgical procedure transanal total mesorectal excision (taTME) has rapidly become an interest of research in order to overcome the shortcomings of laparoscopic surgery in the treatment of middle and low rectal cancer. taTME is a new natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery modality combining three rectal surgery techniques. Methods A retrospective clinical study was conducted in a single centre for a period of 3 years, and herein we report on our first 25 taTME procedures in patients with middle and lower third rectal adenocarcinoma. Results The main demographics were evaluated. The mean age of patients was 64 ± 12 years. There were predominantly males (72%) and 7 female patients (28%) with an average body mass index of 29 ± 4.8 kg/m2. High blood pressure, obesity, chronic heart insufficiency, chronic atrial fibrillation, and diabetes mellitus were commonly diagnosed in all patients. A circumferential resection margin >1 mm was achieved in 16% (n = 4), >2 mm in 40% (n = 10), and >3 mm in 44% (n = 11) of operated patients. The average CRM was 1.8 ± 0.9 cm. In 24% of cases, the distance of a tumour from the mesorectal fascia (MRF) was <1 mm; meanwhile, for 76% of patients, the tumour margin was >1 mm from the MRF. Recovery to flatus was 3 ± 1 days. The average length of hospital stay was 11 ± 3 days. The overall postoperative morbidity was 8%, i.e. one (4%) complication classified as Clavien-Dindo degree I and one (4%) major (IIIb) complication. Subsequently, all patients successfully recovered and were discharged from hospital. During the follow-up period no cancer recurrence was observed. Conclusion Our results nicely demonstrate that taTME can be safely performed with acceptable perioperative complications in patients with middle or lower third rectal cancer. In addition, the perioperative morbidity is also acceptable. However, taTME remains a technically highly demanding operation but is feasible and safe after the appropriate experience is gained. Nevertheless, larger multi-centre prospective randomised studies are ongoing to confirm the safety and to verify oncological results when compared to laparoscopic rectal surgery.","Mikalauskas, Saulius; Uselis, Simonas; Jurkeviciutė, Digne; Poskus, Tomas; Poskus, Eligijus; Strupas, Kestutis",Visceral medicine,https://doi.org/10.1159/000495309; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31367610/,239

The purpose of this study was to better understand how the COVID-19 pandemic affected their employment status and day-to-day work. METHODS A cross-sectional, online survey was conducted (May-June 2020). Recruitment occurred through the National Association of Peer Specialists and additional snowball sampling. Closed- and open-ended questions sought information about employment status, work tasks, challenges faced by PSS and by individuals they supported, and positive impacts they experienced. RESULTS A total of 1,280 surveys were analyzed. Nine percent of respondents reported having lost their job as a result of COVID-19. Of these, 65% reported a length of employment of 2 or more years, and 61% reported working 35 hours or less per week. Job tasks changed dramatically, with 73% reporting engagement in new tasks, including increased reliance on technology (N=717), increased coordination of resources (N=123), and COVID-19-related tasks (N=142). Engagement in some support tasks decreased significantly from prepandemic levels, including individual support provision (p<0.001) and group facilitation (p<0.001). Respondents reported significant challenges among individuals they supported, including increased isolation (92%), substance use (67%), housing instability (38%), and food insecurity (64%). Although respondents also reported challenges, satisfaction with organizational and supervisory support was high. Most respondents (73%) reported positive impacts or benefits from the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS The changing roles and tasks identified in this study have implications for hiring, training, supervising, and supporting peer staff.

We developed the Pandemic Stress Questionnaire (PSQ) and tested its psychometric properties, characterized experiences in emerging adults, and examined associations with internalizing symptoms. METHODS Emerging adults (N = 450) completed the PSQ and measures of internalizing symptoms and perceived stress through an online platform in May 2020. One month later, 288 participants completed a follow-up questionnaire to assess reliability of the PSQ and longitudinal associations between stress and internalizing symptoms. RESULTS Results supported the validity/reliability of PSQ total scores and indicated that stressful events were highly prevalent in May, particularly among younger, female, and Black emerging adults. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were high overall, but decreased at the follow-up assessment. Pandemic-related stress was moderately associated with both depression and anxiety at each assessment, but baseline stress did not predict change in symptoms when controlling for baseline symptoms. CONCLUSIONS Results provide empirical evidence that emerging adults are at high risk for depression and anxiety related to the psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and highlight specific types of experiences associated with greatest risk. Further, this study provides support for a questionnaire measure of experiences related to the COVID-19 pandemic that can be applied in future work to advance understanding of risk and resilience in response to stressful events.","Kujawa, Autumn; Green, Haley; Compas, Bruce E; Dickey, Lindsay; Pegg, Samantha",Depression and anxiety,https://doi.org/10.1002/da.23109; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33169481/,239

This observational study used routinely collected programmatic data from 20 African countries reported to the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) from October 2018 to September 2019 to assess HIV testing coverage and case finding among adults (defined as persons aged ≥15 years). Indicators included number of HIV tests conducted, number of HIV-positive test results, and percentage positivity rate. Overall, the majority of countries reported higher HIV case finding among women than among men. However, a slightly higher percentage positivity was recorded among men (4.7%) than among women (4.1%). Provider-initiated counseling and testing (PITC) in health facilities identified approximately two thirds of all new cases, but index testing had the highest percentage positivity in all countries among both sexes. Yields from voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) and mobile testing varied by sex and by country. These findings highlight the need to identify and implement the most efficient strategies for HIV case finding in these countries to close coverage gaps.

126979,Association of Psychiatric Disorders With Mortality Among Patients With COVID-19.,2021-01-27,"Actuality One of the most widely discussed treatments for patients with COVID-19, especially at the beginning of the epidemy, was the use of the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). The first small non-randomized trials showed the ability of HCQ and its combination with azithromycin to accelerate the elimination of the virus and ease the acute phase of the disease. Later, large, randomized trials did not confirm it (RECOVERY, SOLIDARITY). This study is a case-control study in which we compared patients who received and did not receive HCQ.Material and Methods 103 patients (25 in the HCQ treatment group and 78 in the control group) with confirmed COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA was detected in 26 of 73 in the control group (35.6%) and in 10 of 25 (40%) in the HCQ group) and in the rest - a typical picture of viral pneumonia on multislice computed tomography [MSCT]) were included in the analysis. The severity of lung damage was limited to stages I-II, the CRP level should not exceed 60 mg/dL, and oxygen saturation in the air within 92-98%. We planned to analysis the duration of treatment of patients in the hospital, the days until the normalization of body temperature, the number of points according to the original SHOCS-COVID integral scale, and changes in its components (C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, and the percentage of lung damage according to MSCT).Results Analysis for the whole group revealed a statistically significant increase in the time to normalization of body temperature from 4 to 7 days (by 3 days, p<0.001), and the duration of hospitalization from 9.4 to 11.8 days (by 2.4 days, p=0.002) when using HCQ in comparison with control. Given the incomplete balance of the groups, the main analysis included 46 patients who were matched by propensity score matching. The trend towards similar dynamics continued. HCQ treatment slowed down the time to normalization of body temperature by 1.8 days (p=0.074) and lengthened the hospitalization time by 2.1 days (p=0.042). The decrease in scores on the SHOCS -COVID scale was statistically significant in both groups, and there were no differences between them (delta - 3.00 (2.90) in the HCQ group and - 2.69 (1.55) in control, p=0.718). At the same time, in the control group, the CRP level returned to normal (4.06 mg/dl), and with the use of GC, it decreased but remained above the norm (6.21 mg/dl, p=0.05). Side effects requiring discontinuation of treatment were reported in 3 patients in the HCQ group and none in the control group.Conclusion We have not identified any positive properties of HCQ and its ability to influence the severity of COVID-19. This antimalarial agent slows down the normalization of the body's inflammatory response and lengthens the time spent in the hospital. HCQ should not be used in the treatment of COVID-19.","Kamalov, A A; Mareev, V Yu; Orlova, Ya A; Plisyk, A G; Akopyan, Z A; Mareev, Yu V; Mershina, E A; Begrambekova, Yu L; Pakhomov, P V",Kardiologiia,https://doi.org/10.18087/cardio.2021.2.n1548; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33734044/,239

High-quality, consistent images are required for accurate telediagnoses when monitoring lesions over time. To date there are no tools to assess the quality of sequential images taken by consumers using mobile teledermoscopy. The purpose of this study was to develop a tool to assess the quality of images acquired by consumers. METHODS Participants imaged skin lesions that they felt were concerning at baseline, 1-, and 2-months. A checklist to assess the quality of consumer sequential imaging of skin lesions was developed based on the International Skin Imaging Collaboration guidelines. A scale was implemented to grade the quality of the images: 0 (low) to 18 (very high). Intra- and inter-reliability of the checklist was assessed using Bland-Altman analysis. Using this checklist, the consistency with which 85 sets of images were scored by 2 evaluators were compared using Kappa statistics. Items with a low Kappa value <0.4 were removed. RESULTS After reliability testing, 5 of the items were removed due to low Kappa values (<0.4) and the final checklist included 13 items surveying: lesion selection; image orientation; lighting; field of view; focus and depth of view. Participants had a mean age of 41 years (range 19-73), and 67% were female. Most participants (84%, n = 71/85) were able to select and image the correct lesion over time for both the dermoscopic and overview images. Younger participants (<40 years old) scored significantly higher (8.1 ± 2.1) on the imaging checklist compared to older participants (7.1 ± 2.4; p = 0.037). Participants had most difficulty with consistent image orientation. CONCLUSIONS This checklist could be used as a triage tool to filter images acquired by consumers prior to telediagnosis evaluation, which would improve the efficiency and accuracy of teledermatology and teledermoscopy processes. It may also be used to provide feedback to the consumers to improve image acquisition over time.","Koh, Uyen; Betz-Stablein, Brigid; O'Hara, Montana; Horsham, Caitlin; Curiel-Lewandrowski, Clara; Soyer, H Peter; Janda, Monika",Dermatology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000515158; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33849022/,239
128372,Patient similarity for precision medicine: A systematic review.,2018,"BACKGROUND/AIMS Liver biopsy has traditionally been used for determining the degree of fibrosis, however there are several limitations. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) real-time elastography (RTE) is a novel technology that uses image enhancement to display differences in tissue compressibility. We sought to assess whether liver fibrosis index (LFI) can distinguish normal, fatty, and cirrhotic liver tissue. METHODS A total of 50 patients undergoing EUS were prospectively enrolled. RTE of the liver was performed to synthesize the LFI in each patient. Univariate and multivariable analyses were performed. Chi-square and t-tests were performed for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. A p-value of <0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS Abdominal imaging prior to endoscopic evaluation suggested normal tissue, fatty liver, and cirrhosis in 26, 16, and 8 patients, respectively. Patients with cirrhosis had significantly increased mean LFI compared to the fatty liver (3.2 vs. 1.7, p<0.001) and normal (3.2 vs. 0.8, p<0.001) groups. The fatty liver group showed significantly increased LFI compared to the normal group (3.8 vs. 1.4, p<0.001). Multivariable regression analysis suggested that LFI was an independent predictor of group features (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS LFI computed from RTE images significantly correlates with abdominal imaging and can distinguish normal, fatty, and cirrhotic-appearing livers; therefore, LFI may play an important role in patients with chronic liver disease.","Schulman, Allison R; Lin, Ming V; Rutherford, Anna; Chan, Walter W; Ryou, Marvin",Clinical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.5946/ce.2017.095; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29566479/,239
128875,The Nationwide Burden of Neurological Conditions Requiring Emergency Neurosurgery.,2017,"BACKGROUND Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which at the time of writing (January 2021) was responsible for more than 2.25 million deaths worldwide and over 100,000 deaths in the UK. SARS-CoV-2 appears to be highly transmissible and could rapidly spread in residential care homes. OBJECTIVE The work undertaken aimed to estimate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of viral detection point-of-care tests for detecting SARS-CoV-2 compared with laboratory-based tests in the setting of a hypothetical care home facility for elderly residents. PERSPECTIVE/SETTING The perspective was that of the NHS in 2020. The setting was a hypothetical care home facility for elderly residents. Care homes with en suite rooms and with shared facilities were modelled separately. METHODS A discrete event simulation model was constructed to model individual residents and simulate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 once it had entered the residential care facility. The numbers of COVID-19-related deaths and critical cases were recorded in addition to the number of days spent in isolation. Thirteen strategies involving different hypothetical SARS-CoV-2 tests were modelled. Recently published desirable and acceptable target product profiles for SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care tests and for hospital-based SARS-CoV-2 tests were modelled. Scenario analyses modelled early release from isolation based on receipt of a negative SARS-CoV-2 test result and the impact of vaccination. Incremental analyses were undertaken using both incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and net monetary benefits. RESULTS Cost-effectiveness results depended on the proportion of residential care facilities penetrated by SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care tests with desirable target product profiles appear to have high net monetary benefit values. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care tests with acceptable target product profiles had low net monetary benefit values because of unnecessary isolations. The benefit of allowing early release from isolation depended on whether or not the facility had en suite rooms. The greater the assumed efficacy of vaccination, the lower the net monetary benefit values associated with SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care tests, when assuming that a vaccine lowers the risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2. LIMITATIONS There is considerable uncertainty in the values for key parameters within the model, although calibration was undertaken in an attempt to mitigate this. Some degree of Monte Carlo sampling error persists because of the timelines of the project. The example care home simulated will also not match those of decision-makers deciding on the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of introducing SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care tests. Given these limitations, the results should be taken as indicative rather than definitive, particularly the cost-effectiveness results when the relative cost per SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care test is uncertain. CONCLUSIONS SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care tests have considerable potential for benefit for use in residential care facilities, but whether or not this materialises depends on the diagnostic accuracy and costs of forthcoming SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care tests. FUTURE WORK More accurate results would be obtained when there is more certainty on the diagnostic accuracy of and the reduction in time to test result associated with SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care tests when used in the context of residential care facilities, the proportion of care home penetrated by SARS-CoV-2 and the levels of immunity once vaccination is administered. These parameters are currently uncertain. FUNDING This report was commissioned by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Evidence Synthesis programme as project number 132154.

Update as of October 31st, 2020.",2020-12-02,"INTRODUCTION In order to expand the availability of cystoscopy to underserved areas we have proposed utilizing advanced practice providers (APPs) to perform cystoscopy with real-time interpretation by the urologist on a telemedicine platform, termed ""tele-cystoscopy"". The purpose of this study is to have blinded external reviewers retrospectively compare multi-site, prospectively collected video data from tele-cystoscopy with the video of traditional cystoscopy in terms of video clarity, practitioner proficiency and diagnostic capability. MATERIALS AND METHODS Each patient underwent tele-cystoscopy by a trained APP and traditional cystoscopy with an onsite urologist. Prospectively collected tele-cystoscopy transmitted video, tele-cystoscopy onsite video, and traditional cystoscopy video were de-identified and blinded to external reviewers. Each video was evaluated and rated twice by independent reviewers, and diagnostic agreement was quantified. RESULTS Six tele-cystoscopy encounters were reviewed for a total of 36 assessments. Video clarity, defined by speed of transmission and image resolution, was better for onsite compared to transmitted tele-cystoscopy. Practitioner proficiency for thoroughness of inspection was rated at 92% for tele-cystoscopy and 100% for traditional cystoscopy. Confidence in identification of an abnormality was equivalent. Four of six videos had 100% agreement between reviewers for next action taken, indicating high diagnostic agreement. Additionally, provider performing the cystoscopy and location did not statistically influence the ability to make a diagnosis or action taken. CONCLUSIONS This model has excellent completeness of exam, equivalent ability to identify abnormalities and external validation of action taken. This pilot study demonstrates that tele-cystoscopy may expand access to bladder cancer surveillance.","Lobo, Jennifer M; Horton, Bethany; Jones, Randy A; Tyson, Teresa; Hill-Collins, Paula; Sims, Terran; Rueb, Jessica J; Corey, Thomas; Rheuban, Karen; Battle, Patricia; Beller, Haerin; Schenkman, Noah; Culp, Stephen; Krupski, Tracey L",The Journal of urology,https://doi.org/10.1097/ju.0000000000001092; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32330408/,239
130025,"Importance for our field of the newly published Cochrane Special Collection on ""Coronavirus (COVID-19): evidence relevant to clinical rehabilitation"".",2020-11-14,"Importance US law generally requires testing of high-risk medical devices prior to approval, as well as premarket evaluation of moderate-risk medical devices, with the goal of ensuring that the benefits of these products exceed their risks. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) attempts to balance the need for evidence generation with an approval process that facilitates access and encourages innovation. Objective To review the development of laws and standards affecting the evaluation and oversight of medical devices by the US regulatory system and the outcomes of this system from 1976 to 2020. Evidence Review Laws enacted by US Congress and regulations promulgated by the FDA through 2020; databases maintained by the FDA of device authorizations from 1976 to 2020; and annual reports of user fees paid to the FDA by industry. Findings Since Congress and the FDA initiated premarket review of medical devices in 1976, some fundamental innovations in the device regulation system have included special pathways to accelerate availability of investigational devices, more flexible evidence and review requirements, and increased funding to the FDA through industry-paid user fees. From 1987 to 2020, the annual number of novel devices granted premarket approval (which excludes supplements) ranged from 8 to 56 (median, 32), and the number of clearances for 510(k) devices (those that are ""substantially equivalent"" to marketed devices) ranged from 2804 to 5762 (median, 3404). User fee funding for devices was established in 2002 and annual fees collected increased from $30 million in 2003 (in 2019 dollars) to more than $208 million in 2019; this represented 43% of FDA funding related to the review of medical devices. Although many new devices have led to considerable patient benefit, such as hypodermic needles and magnetic resonance imaging machines, important adverse events caused by some devices, such as an implanted device for birth control and a surgical mesh implant for pelvic organ prolapse, have led to calls to reexamine the regulatory system for such products. Conclusions and Relevance Over the last 45 years, medical device regulation has become more complex, with more regulatory pathways and greater variations in the evidence and controls required for authorization. Increased FDA support from industry and concern about flexible authorization requirements reflect the tension between efficient access and the need for assurances that products will safely benefit patients.","Darrow, Jonathan J; Avorn, Jerry; Kesselheim, Aaron S",JAMA,https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2021.11171; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34342614/,239

This paper is part of the WE-THRIVE (Worldwide Elements to Harmonize Research in Long-Term Care Living Environments) group's initiative which aims to improve international academic collaboration. We followed best practices to develop CDEs by conducting a literature review of clinical staff (i.e., Regulated Nurses, Health Care Aides) training measures, and convening a subgroup of WE-THRIVE experts to review the literature review results to develop suitable CDEs. The international expert panel discussed and critically reflected on the current knowledge gaps from the literature review results. The panel proposed three candidate CDEs which focused on the presence of and the measurement of training. These three proposed CDEs seek to facilitate international research as well as assist in policy and decision-making regarding LTC homes worldwide. This study is a critical first step to develop candidate CDE items to measure staff training internationally. Further work is required to get feedback from other researchers about the proposed CDEs, and assess the feasibility of these CDEs in high and low resourced settings.","Chu, Charlene H; McGilton, Katherine S; Spilsbury, Karen; Le, Kim N; Boscart, Veronique; Backman, Annica; Fagertun, Anette; Devi, Reena; Zúñiga, Franziska",Gerontology & geriatric medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/2333721421999312; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33718524/,239
130320,Patient Involvement in Education of Nutrition and Dietetics Students: A Systematic Review.,2019-11-16,"MAIN CONCLUSION A hypothetical model of drought tolerance mechanism of Larix kaempferi was established through SMRT-seq and Illumina HiSeq. Larix kaempferi is an important economic and ecological species and a major afforestation species in north-eastern China. To date, no information has been reliably derived regarding full-length cDNA sequencing information on L. kaempferi. By single-molecule long-read isoform sequencing (SMRT-seq), here we report a total of 26,153,342 subreads (21.24 Gb) and 330,371 circular consensus sequence (CCS) reads after the modification of site mismatch, and 35,414 unigenes were successfully collected. To gain deeper insights into the molecular mechanisms of L. kaempferi response to drought stress, we combined Illumina HiSeq with SMRT-seq to decode full-length transcripts. In this study, we report 27 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in the perception and transmission of drought stress signals in L. kaempferi. A large number of DEGs responding to drought stress were detected in L. kaempferi, especially DEGs involved in the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging, lignin biosynthesis, and sugar metabolism, and DEGs encoding drought stress proteins. We detected 73 transcription factors (TFs) under drought stress, including AP2/ERF, bZIP, TCP, and MYB. This study provides basic full sequence resources for L. kaempferi research and will help us to better understand the functions of drought-resistance genes in L. kaempferi.","Li, Wenlong; Lee, Joobin; Yu, Sen; Wang, Fude; Lv, Wanqiu; Zhang, Xin; Li, Chenghao; Yang, Jingli",Planta,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00425-020-03555-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423138/,239

132510,Comprehensive rehabilitation treatment for sub acute COVID-19 patients: an observational study.,2021-02-04,"BACKROUND The treatment of wide neck bifurcation aneurysms remains challenging despite the introduction of new techniques (Y stenting, waffle cone technique, or flow diverter stents). The Woven EndoBridge (WEB) device is an innovative solution for this type of cerebral aneurysm. A new WEB 17 is now available and has been designed to offer smaller sized devices to optimize navigability and delivery. METHODS Between February 2017 and April 2018 all patients treated with the WEB 17 device in our center were retrospectively reviewed. 25 patients with 28 non-ruptured aneurysms were identified and analyzed. Three patients with two aneurysms both treated with the WEB device were identified. RESULTS The device was successfully deployed in all cases. Procedure related morbidity was 4% and mortality was 0%. In one case, a delayed postprocedural thromboembolic event occurred owing to device protrusion. Technical success, complications, angiographic outcomes, procedural data, and follow-ups are reported. The modified Rankin Scale score at discharge was 0 for 24 patients (96%). At the 3, 6, or 9 month follow-up, angiograms were taken of 21 of the 25 patients (84%) (24 of 28 aneurysms had been controlled); 3 patients (3 aneurysms) did not receive angiographic follow-up at the time of submission of this work. Complete occlusion was achieved in 22 of 24 aneurysms (91.66%), and 2 of 24 aneurysm (8.33%) showed a neck remnant. CONCLUSIONS The WEB 17 is safe and technically feasible, according to this retrospective single center analysis. For very small bifurcation aneurysms, the WEB 17 seems to have lower complication rates than stent assisted techniques. However, further studies are needed to evaluate the complication rate and long term efficiency.","Mihalea, Cristian; Caroff, Jildaz; Pagiola, Igor; Ikka, Leon; Hashemi, Gelareh Bani; Naderi, Soheil; Chalumeau, Vanessa; Ples, Horia; Popa, Bogdan Valeriu; Yasuda, Thomas; Marenco de la Torre, Joaquin Jose; Iacobucci, Marta; Ozanne, Augustin; Gallas, Sophie; Rouchaud, Aymeric; Pescariu, Sorin; Moret, Jacques; Spelle, Laurent",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2018-014343; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30655358/,239

Because SARS-CoV-2 is highly infectious due to contamination in the air, there is a high risk of infection in the dental environment which is represents a serious problem for professionals and students (dentistry and dental hygiene). In Italy, since February 23, 2020, the government has suspended all teaching activities of schools and universities. METHODS An anonymous questionnaire was administered to the students of the degree courses in Dental Hygiene of the Emilia Romagna Region, one of the most affected regions in Italy. The survey was intended to highlight the practical and emotional consequences of the emergency of COVID-19 on educational activities and in the training of students. RESULTS The survey was sent to the 150 students enrolled in the universities of Bologna, Ferrara and Modena and Reggio Emilia; 141 of them completed it (94%). Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, several surveys have been proposed to measure the impact of this emergency situation on dental professionals; at present, however, there are still no assessments for dental hygiene degree courses, in particular aimed at assessing the psychological impact on students. CONCLUSIONS Students consider the dental hygienist as a risky profession, while the risk taken by patients is considered as low.

Non-white individuals continue to receive less guideline-concordant care and experience higher rates of adverse outcomes compared with white individuals. Health policy and quality improvement interventions have helped to narrow the gap; however, ongoing efforts are needed to continue to attempt to eliminate this disparity.

Shorter than normal clotting time (CT) and higher than normal maximum clot firmness (MCF) in extrinsic rotational thromboelastometry (EXTEM) and fibrinogen rotational thromboelastometry (FIBTEM), shorter than normal EXTEM clot formation time (CFT), and higher than normal α-angle were classified as markers of hypercoagulable state. Increment in the number of patients with ≥2 hypercoagulable parameters, higher EXTEM (P = .0001), FIBTEM MCF (P = .0001) and maximum lysis decrement (P = .002) with increment in disease severity was observed (P = .0001). Significant positive correlations between IL6 and CT EXTEM (P = .003), MCF EXTEM (P = .033), MCF FIBTEM (P = .01), and negative with ML EXTEM (P = .006) were seen.

RT-PCR testing for HRV was performed on nasal and sputum samples. Amplification products were sequenced to assign species HRV-A, B or C. Clinical, virologic and environmental factors were compared for those infected with HRV compared to those without HRV infection as well as symptomatic HRV infection and asymptomatic HRV infection. RESULTS HRVs were detected in 29 participants during 20 illnesses and 11 routine visits. HRV was detected in nasal samples from 15/102 (14.7%) illnesses compared to 2/685 (0.4%) routine visits (p<.0001). Sputum samples were also more frequently positive from illnesses than routine visits [14/72 (19.4%) vs. 16/310 (5.2%) p<.0001]. Contact with school age children was the only factor that was significantly associated with HRV infection and symptomatic HRV illness. Severity of underlying lung disease and virologic factors were not associated with symptomatic illness. CONCLUSIONS Contact with school aged children is a risk factor for both infection and symptomatic HRV illness. Attention to good hand hygiene and avoidance of direct contact with ill children may help patients with COPD avoid HRV related illness.","Gandhi, Anurag; Walsh, Edward E; Formica, Maria A; Hennessey, Patricia A; Criddle, Mary M; Peterson, Derick R; Baran, Andrea; Falsey, Ann R",Journal of clinical virology : the official publication of the Pan American Society for Clinical Virology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2012.08.020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22999488/,239
138617,How patient-generated health data and patient-reported outcomes affect patient-clinician relationships: A systematic review.,2020-06-20,"Canine neuropathic pain (NeuP) has been poorly investigated. This study aimed to evaluate the pain burden, sensory profile and inflammatory cytokines in dogs with naturally-occurring NeuP. Twenty-nine client-owned dogs with NeuP were included in a prospective, partially masked, randomized crossover clinical trial, and treated with gabapentin/placebo/gabapentin-meloxicam or gabapentin-meloxicam/placebo/gabapentin (each treatment block of 7 days; total 21 days). Pain scores, mechanical (MNT) and electrical (ENT) nociceptive thresholds and descending noxious inhibitory controls (DNIC) were assessed at baseline, days 7, 14, and 21. DNIC was evaluated using ΔMNT (after-before conditioning stimulus). Positive or negative ΔMNT corresponded to inhibitory or facilitatory pain profiles, respectively. Pain scores were recorded using the Client Specific Outcome Measures (CSOM), Canine Brief Pain Inventory (CBPI), and short-form Glasgow Composite Measure Pain Scale (CMPS-SF). Data from baseline were compared to those of sixteen healthy controls. ΔMNT, but not MNT and ENT, was significantly larger in controls (2.3 ± 0.9 N) than in NeuP (-0.2 ± 0.7 N). The percentage of dogs with facilitatory sensory profile was similar at baseline and after placebo (61.5-63%), and between controls and after gabapentin (33.3-34.6%). The CBPI scores were significantly different between gabapentin (CBPI pain and CBPI overall impression) and/or gabapentin-meloxicam (CBPI pain and interference) when compared with baseline, but not placebo. The CBPI scores were not significantly different between placebo and baseline. The concentration of cytokines was not different between groups or treatments. Dogs with NeuP have deficient inhibitory pain mechanisms. Pain burden was reduced after gabapentin and/or gabapentin-meloxicam when compared with baseline using CBPI and CMPS-SF scores. However, these scores were not superior than placebo, nor placebo was superior to baseline evaluations. A caregiver placebo effect may have biased the results.","Ruel, Hélène L M; Watanabe, Ryota; Evangelista, Marina C; Beauchamp, Guy; Auger, Jean-Philippe; Segura, Mariela; Steagall, Paulo V",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237121; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33253197/,239
138947,COVID-19 Pandemic and JBJS.,2020-04-02,"BACKGROUND Emergency airway management represents an event with high acuity but unpredictable frequency and therefore presents a challenge for adequate staffing. Given circadian and seasonal variations, we hypothesized that the majority of emergency airway events happen after normal working hours and during the winter months. METHODS A retrospective analysis of 1,482 intubations by an emergency airway team over a 3-y period was performed. The data were obtained from hospitalized patients who required emergency airway management in a large academic medical center. A database of emergency airway consultations was analyzed for intubation time and date information, as well as geographic location within the hospital. RESULTS A greater percentage of emergency intubations occurred during day shift hours (7 am to 7 pm) compared with night shift hours, 57% and 43%, respectively (P < .01). The monthly frequency of intubations was not uniformly distributed across the year (P < .01). The greatest percentage of intubations was performed in February (10.9%), with the lowest being recorded in August (4.7%). CONCLUSIONS Emergency airway service utilization is highest during daytime hours, with seasonal variations composed of higher consults in the winter and lower consults in the summer.","Adams, M Christopher; Schmidt, Ulrich; Hess, Dean R; Stelfox, Henry T; Bittner, Edward A",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.02432; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24129335/,239

141109,Acetabular cup revision combined with tensor facia lata reconstruction for management of massive abductor avulsion after failed total hip arthroplasty.,2014,"BACKGROUND Neuropathic groin pain can be a severely debilitating condition. Triple neurectomy of the ilioinguinal, iliohypogastric, and genitofemoral nerves is a viable treatment option. OBJECTIVE To present our initial experience with the laparoscopic retroperitoneal approach to triple neurectomy. METHODS Three patients (33 to 48 years of age) presented with chronic groin pain of 3 to 7 years' duration. The discomfort manifested in the ilioinguinal, iliohypogastric, and genitofemoral nerve distributions and severely affected their lifestyles, resulting in multiple unsuccessful medical and surgical treatments without symptomatic relief. Because the patients failed other modes of treatment, they underwent a laparoscopic retroperitoneal triple neurectomy. RESULTS Three patients underwent a triple neurectomy from November 2006 to May 2009. All patients reported debilitating chronic groin pain and underwent prior treatments ranging from anesthetic blocks to orchiectomy without lasting relief. The first case illustrates the anatomic variation of the genitofemoral nerve and the importance of transecting both branches for adequate symptomatic relief. The remaining cases demonstrate successful transection of all 3 nerves with significant pain relief at 10 months to 3 years of follow-up. No major complications were encountered. CONCLUSION This technique provides several advantages in the treatment of chronic groin pain. The retroperitoneal approach provides a facile method to reach the nerves in 1 stage and provides a dissection field free of previous scars. As a laparoscopic technique, benefits include small incision sites with small scars, less postoperative pain, and shorter hospitalizations and/or same-day discharges with effective relief of groin pain.","Song, Jae W; Wolf, J Stuart; McGillicuddy, John E; Bhangoo, Sandeep; Yang, Lynda J-S",Neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1227/neu.0b013e3182114480; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21336213/,239

We report a case of a traumatic gunshot-induced massive chylothorax. Inguinal lymphangiogram was performed demonstrating the site of injury at the cisterna chyli. The cisterna chyli was successfully accessed via a percutaneous approach, and embolization was performed. Chylothorax immediately resolved after two rounds of embolization. Although lymphangiography has been traditionally challenging and cumbersome, because of the need for pedal lymph access, the recent use of inguinal lymphangiography has made this technique more practical. Techniques used for embolization of the thoracic duct may be applied to the cisterna chyli, which is much more challenging to treat surgically.","Allison, Stephen; Rainey, Matthew; Aarabi, Shahram; Padia, Siddharth A",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00270-013-0590-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23474916/,239
142595,An exploratory study of combination buspirone and melatonin SR in major depressive disorder (MDD): a possible role for neurogenesis in drug discovery.,2012,"PURPOSE In the UK, most referrals to the hospital eye service (HES) originate from community optometrists (CO). This audit investigates the quality of referrals, replies, and communication between CO and the HES. METHODS Optometric referrals and replies were extracted from three practices in England. If no reply letter was found, the records were searched at each local HES unit, and additional replies or records copied. De-identified referrals, replies and records were audited by a panel against established standards to evaluate whether the referrals were necessary, accurate and directed to the appropriate professional. The referral rate (RR) and referral reply rate (RRR) were calculated. RESULTS A total of 459 de-identified referrals were extracted. The RR ranged from 3.6%-8.7%. The proportion of referred patients who were seen in the HES unit was 63%-76%. From the CO perspective, the proportion of referrals for which they received replies ranged from 26%-49%. Adjusting the number of referrals for cases when it would be reasonable to expect an HES reply, RRR becomes 38%-62%. Patients received a copy of the reply in 3%-21% of cases. Referrals were made to the appropriate service in over 95% of cases, were judged necessary in 93%-97% and were accurate in 81%-98% of cases. The referral reply addressed the reason for the referral in 93%-97% and was meaningful in 94%-99% of cases. The most common conditions referred were glaucoma, cataract, anterior segment lesions, and neurological/ocular motor anomalies. The CO/HES dyad (pairing) in the area with the lowest average household income had the highest RR. CONCLUSIONS In contrast with the Royal College of Ophthalmologists/College of Optometrists joint statement on sharing patient information, CO referrals often do not elicit a reply to the referring CO. Replies from the HES to COs are important for patient care, benefitting patients and clinicians, and minimising unnecessary HES appointments.","Evans, Bruce J W; Edgar, David F; Jessa, Zahra; Yammouni, Robert; Campbell, Peter; Soteri, Kiki; Hobby, Angharad; Khatoon, Abeeda; Beg, Amaad; Harsum, Steven; Aggarwal, Rajesh; Shah, Rakhee",Ophthalmic & physiological optics : the journal of the British College of Ophthalmic Opticians,https://doi.org/10.1111/opo.12772; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33354812/,239

Envelope glycoprotein B (gB) is conserved among all herpesviruses and is a critical component of the complex that mediates membrane fusion and entry. Here we demonstrate that mildly acidic pH triggers specific conformational changes in herpes simplex virus (HSV) gB. The antigenic structure of gB was specifically altered by exposure to low pH both in vitro and during entry into host cells. The oligomeric conformation of gB was altered at a similar pH range. Exposure to acid pH appeared to convert virion gB into a lower-order oligomer. The detected conformational changes were reversible, similar to those in other class III fusion proteins. Exposure of purified, recombinant gB to mildly acidic pH resulted in similar changes in conformation and caused gB to become more hydrophobic, suggesting that low pH directly affects gB. We propose that intracellular low pH induces alterations in gB conformation that, together with additional triggers such as receptor binding, are essential for virion-cell fusion during herpesviral entry by endocytosis.","Dollery, Stephen J; Delboy, Mark G; Nicola, Anthony V",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02573-09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20147407/,239

However, such association may be modified by possible baseline differences in glycemic control between insulin users and non-insulin users. Misinterpretation of the association between insulin treatment and mortality could lead to confusion in clinical practice and hospitalized patients with COVID-19 for whom insulin treatment is appropriately indicated may be omitted from such treatment. However, requirement for insulin during hospitalization for COVID-19 may be a marker of poor prognosis and as such could be used to identify patient population who require more aggressive treatments to prevent mortality.","Kow, Chia Siang; Hasan, Syed Shahzad",Endocrine research,https://doi.org/10.1080/07435800.2021.1892748; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33635726/,239

MATERIALS AND METHODS Between March 2018 and September 2020, surgeries were simulated using plastic models manufactured by 3D printers on the two patients with pilon fractures. Also, custom-made acetabular implants were used on two patients with an acetabular bone defect for the revision of total hip arthroplasty (THA). RESULTS More comfortable surgeries were experienced in pilon fractures using preoperative plastic models. Similarly, during the follow-up period, the patients that applied custom-made acetabular implants showed a fixed and well-positioning in radiographic examination. These patients did not experience any surgical complications and achieved an excellent recovery. CONCLUSION Preoperative surgical simulation with 3D printed models can increase the comfort of fracture surgeries. Also, custom-made 3D printed acetabular implants can perform an important task in patients treated with revision THA surgery due to severe acetabular defects.","Ertürk, Cemil; Ayyıldız, Simel; Erdöl, Cevdet",Joint diseases and related surgery,https://doi.org/10.52312/jdrs.2021.20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34145802/,239
145071,"Low serum potassium among patients with COVID-19 in Bangkok, Thailand: Coincidence or clinically relevant?",2020-12-18,"Activatable contrast agents are of ongoing research interest because they offer low background and high specificity to the imaging target. Engineered sensitivity to protease activity is particularly desirable because proteases are critical biomarkers in cancer, infectious disease, inflammatory disorders, and so forth. Herein, we developed and characterized a set of peptide-linked cyanine conjugates for dual-modal detection of protease activity via photoacoustic (PA) and fluorescence imaging. The peptide-dye conjugates were designed to undergo contact quenching via intramolecular dimerization and contained n dyes (n = 2, 3, or 4) with n - 1 cleavable peptide substrates. The absorption peaks of the conjugates were blue-shifted 50 nm relative to the free dye and had quenched fluorescence. This effect was sensitive to solvent polarity and could be reversed by solvent switching from water to dimethyl sulfoxide. Employing trypsin as a model protease, we observed a 2.5-fold recovery of the peak absorbance, 330-4600-fold fluorescent enhancement, and picomolar detection limits following proteolysis. The dimer probe was further characterized for PA activation. Proteolysis released single dye-peptide fragments that produced a 5-fold PA enhancement through the increased absorption at 680 nm with nanomolar sensitivity to trypsin. The peptide substrate could also be tuned for protease selectivity; as a proof-of-concept, we detected the main protease (Mpro) associated with the viral replication in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Last, the activated probe was imaged subcutaneously in mice and signal was linearly correlated to the cleaved probe. Overall, these results demonstrate a tunable scaffold for the PA molecular imaging of protease activity with potential value in areas such as disease monitoring, tumor imaging, intraoperative imaging, in vitro diagnostics, and point-of-care sensing.","Moore, Colman; Borum, Raina M; Mantri, Yash; Xu, Ming; Fajtová, Pavla; O'Donoghue, Anthony J; Jokerst, Jesse V",ACS sensors,https://doi.org/10.1021/acssensors.1c00518; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34038103/,239

145962,Graft Rupture Rates After Combined ACL and Anterolateral Ligament Reconstruction Versus Isolated ACL Reconstruction: A Matched-Pair Analysis From the SANTI Study Group.,2021-08-05,"BACKGROUND The self-expanding metallic stent (SEMS) provides effective decompression for patients with malignant large bowel obstruction (MLBO); however, mechanical damage to malignant cells from insertion may negatively affect prognosis, similar to surgical manipulation, and its oncological safety is unclear. We examined mechanical damage from SEMS placement using circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). METHODS Between 1 November 2014 and 30 June 2017, 35 MLBO patients were analyzed, comprising 25 SEMS patients and 10 transanal decompression tube (TDT) patients (control). Blood samples were collected before and after decompression on days 0, 1, 3, and 7. cfDNA, ctDNA, white blood cells, C-reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase were analyzed. RESULTS The clinical success rates of SEMS and TDT were 88 and 90%, respectively (p = 1.0). The cfDNA concentration on day 7 was significantly higher in the SEMS group than in the TDT group (992 vs. 308 ng/mL; p = 0.005). A significant increase in ctDNA was observed in the SEMS group compared with the TDT group (83% vs. 22%; p = 0.002). The cfDNA concentration showed strong positive correlations with ctDNA and lactate dehydrogenase (R 2 = 0.838 and 0.593, respectively), and a weak positive correlation with C-reactive protein (R 2 = 0.263). CONCLUSIONS Despite equivalent clinical success rates, SEMS placement increased plasma levels of cfDNA and ctDNA by tumor manipulation, but TDT did not. Colonic stenting showed oncological risk in terms of molecular analysis.","Takahashi, Goro; Yamada, Takeshi; Iwai, Takuma; Takeda, Kohki; Koizumi, Michihiro; Shinji, Seiichi; Uchida, Eiji",Annals of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-017-6300-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29235008/,239

In view of this, there is an urgent need to find a more appropriate therapeutic scheme against COVID-19. The study aimed to investigate whether lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) in combination with other pneumonia-associated adjuvant drugs has a better therapeutic effect on COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS Totally 47 patients with COVID-19 infection who were admitted to Rui'an People's Hospital between January 22 and January 29, 2020 were collected. The patients were divided into the test group and the control group according to whether they had been treated with LPV/r or not during hospitalization. Patients in the test group were treated with LPV/r combined with adjuvant medicine, while those in the control group were just treated with adjuvant medicine. The changes of body temperature, blood routine and blood biochemistry between the two groups were observed and compared. RESULTS Both groups achieved good therapeutic effect with the body temperature of patients decreased gradually from admission to the 10th day of treatment. But the body temperature of patients in the test group decreased faster than that of the control group. Blood routine indexes showed that compared with the control group, the abnormal proportion of white blood cells, lymphocytes and C-reactive protein of the test group could be reduced to some extent. Blood biochemical indexes exhibited that the proportion of patients with abnormal alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase in the test group were lower than the control group. The number of days for nCoV-RNA turning negative after treatment was significantly decreased in the test group than that in the control group. CONCLUSIONS Compared with the treatment of pneumonia-associated adjuvant drugs alone, the combination treatment with LPV/r and adjuvant drugs has a more evident therapeutic effect in lowering the body temperature and restoring normal physiological mechanisms with no evident toxic and side effects. In view of these conclusions, we suggested that the use of LPV/r combined with pneumonia-associated adjuvant drugs in the clinical treatment for patients with COVID-19 should be promoted.","Ye, X-T; Luo, Y-L; Xia, S-C; Sun, Q-F; Ding, J-G; Zhou, Y; Chen, W; Wang, X-F; Zhang, W-W; Du, W-J; Ruan, Z-W; Hong, L",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202003_20706; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32271456/,239

Despite recourse to several imaging modalities, the definite diagnosis of NET can be challenging. Therefore, we tested (68)Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT as a tool for improved diagnosis in a cohort of patients with suspected, nonlocalized NET. METHODS (68)Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT recordings were obtained in 104 consecutive patients meeting at least one of the following criteria: clinical suspicion of NET (n = 70), elevated blood levels of tumor markers (n = 49), and image-based suspicion of NET (n = 53). The presence of NET was validated by histopathology (n = 49) or clinical follow-up of 107 ± 59 wk (n = 55). RESULTS In 36 of 104 patients (35%), NET was histologically verified, most frequently located in the small bowel (10/36), pancreas (8/36), lung (5/36), and stomach (2/36). Twelve patients had tumors of nonneuroendocrine origin, and 7 patients had benign tumors. (68)Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT identified NET in 29 of the 36 cases and excluded the presence of a NET in 61 of the 68 non-NET patients, indicating a sensitivity of 81% and specificity of 90%. The PET/CT gave a false-positive result in 7 patients and a false-negative in another 7 patients, indicating positive and negative predictive values of 81% and 90%, respectively, and an accuracy of 87%. Chromogranin A levels were significantly higher in both PET-positive patients (1,841 vs. 342 ng/mL; P < 0.05) and patients with verified NET (2,214 vs. 524 ng/mL; P < 0.05). CONCLUSION In patients with suspected NETs due to clinical symptoms, elevated levels of tumor markers, or indeterminate tumors suggestive of NET, (68)Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT is highly accurate, thus supporting its use in clinical routine diagnostics.","Haug, Alexander R; Cindea-Drimus, Ramona; Auernhammer, Christoph J; Reincke, Martin; Wängler, Björn; Uebleis, Christopher; Schmidt, Gerwin P; Göke, Burkhard; Bartenstein, Peter; Hacker, Marcus","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",https://doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.111.101675; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22984220/,239

The animals were euthanized by decapitation and the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum were removed to assess oxidative stress parameters and the activity of antioxidant enzymes. Lipid peroxidation levels (TBARS) were unchanged. However, CCl₄ induced oxidative damage to proteins in all tissues studied, and this injury was prevented by both extracts. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was increased by CCl₄ in the cerebral cortex and decreased in other tissues. However, CCl₄ increased catalase (CAT) activity in the cerebellum and decreased it in the cerebral cortex. The SOD/CAT ratio was restored in the cerebellum by both extracts and only in the cerebral cortex by the organic extract.","Wohlenberg, Mariane; Almeida, Daniela; Bokowski, Liane; Medeiros, Niara; Agostini, Fabiana; Funchal, Cláudia; Dani, Caroline",Antioxidants,https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox3020200; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26784867/,239

147329,[Poststroke motor and cognitive impairments: clinical features and current approaches to rehabilitation].,2020,"Rociletinib (CO-1686), a 2,4-diaminopyrimidine derivative, is a highly potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that acts on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) with L858R/T790M mutations. We supposed radioiodinated CO-1686 would function as a useful tool for monitoring EGFR L858R/T790M mutations. To aid in patient selection before therapy with EGFR-TKIs, this study aimed to develop a 125I-labeled derivative of CO-1686, N-{3-[(2-{[4-(4-acetylpiperazin-1-yl)-2-methoxyphenyl]amino}-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidine-4-yl] amino}-5-([125I]iodophenyl)acrylamide ([125I]ICO1686) and evaluate its selectivity toward EGFR L858R/T790M. Radiosynthesis was performed by iododestannylation of the corresponding tributylstannyl precursor with [125I]NaI and N-chlorosuccinimide. The selectivity of the tracer for detecting EGFR L858R/T790M was evaluated using three relevant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines-H1975, H3255 and H441 overexpressing the dual mutation EGFR L858R/T790M, active mutant EGFR L858R and wild-type EGFR, respectively. The nonradioactive ICO1686 and the precursor compound were successfully synthesized. A novel radiolabeled probe, [125I]ICO1686, was prepared with high radiochemical yield (77%) and purity (>99%). ICO1686 exhibited high cytotoxicity toward H1975 (IC50 0.20 ± 0.05 μM) and H3255 (IC50 0.50 ± 0.21 μM), which is comparable to that of CO-1686. In contrast, the cytotoxicity of ICO1686 toward H441 was 10-fold lower than that toward H1975. In the cell uptake study, the radioactivity uptake of [125I]ICO1686 in H1975 was 101.52% dose/mg, whereas the uptakes in H3255 and H441 were 33.52 and 8.95% dose/mg, respectively. The uptake of [125I]ICO1686 in H1975 was greatly reduced to 45.61% dose/mg protein by treatment with excess CO-1686. In vivo biodistribution study of the radiotracer found that its accumulation in H1975 tumor (1.77 ± 0.43% ID/g) was comparable to that in H3255 tumor (1.63 ± 0.23% ID/g) and the accumulation in H1975 tumor was not reduced by pretreatment with an excess dose of CO-1686. Although this radiotracer exhibited highly specific in vitro uptake in target cancer cells, structural modification is required to improve in vivo biodistribution.","Fawwaz, Muammar; Mishiro, Kenji; Nishii, Ryuichi; Sawazaki, Izumi; Shiba, Kazuhiro; Kinuya, Seigo; Ogawa, Kazuma",Molecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules25122914; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32599930/,239
147766,Impact on rehabilitation programs during Covid-19 containment for children with pediatric and perinatal stroke.,2020-06-09,"Stroke is one of the most common neurological diseases with high morbidity, disability and mortality, which is an urgent medical and social problem. Clinically, stroke, depending on its nature and location, causes a wide range of neurological disorders, including movement disorders, as well as a variety of cognitive and neuropsychiatric disorders. There is an emerging need for new approaches to manage patients with cerebrovascular diseases during the pandemic of COVID-19. Rehabilitation measures for the correction of motor and cognitive impairments are very diverse. The use of drugs stimulating the production of neurotrophic factors is considered as a promising direction of pharmacotherapy. Cerebrolysin promotes significant regression of motor and cognitive impairments in the acute and recovery period of ischemic stroke. Based on the data of clinical studies, Cerebrolysin is included in the guidelines for the rehabilitation of patients with stroke in Canada and Germany.","Levin, O S; Bogolepova, A N",Zhurnal nevrologii i psikhiatrii imeni S.S.

148157,The genomics and epigenetics of olfactory neuroblastoma: A systematic review.,2021-08-01,"OBJECTIVE Acute ischemic stroke and silent cerebral infarctions following pipeline embolization device (PED) treatment of intracranial aneurysms have been estimated to occur in 3-6% and in 50.9-90% of patients respectively. The PED with Shield technology (PED-Shield) incorporates a surface phosphorylcholine polymer to reduce the thrombogenicity of the implant. We sought to determine the incidence of diffusion weighted image (DWI) documented cerebral ischemia after PED-Shield treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms. METHODS This prospective study involved a single center series of consecutive patients treated for an unruptured intracranial aneurysm with the PED-Shield. All participants underwent clinical evaluation on admission, after the procedure, at discharge, and 30 days following treatment. Brain MRI was obtained within 72 hours of the procedure. Ischemic lesions identified on DWI sequences where examined as to their number, size, and location in relation to the procedure. RESULTS Over 12 months, 33 patients harboring 38 intracranial aneurysms were treated with the PED-Shield in 36 procedures. Neither mortality nor clinically evident ischemic events were noted in the 30 day postprocedural period. DWI documented, silent cerebral ischemia occurred in six patients (18.18%) after six procedures (16.66%). No statistically significant risk factors for postprocedural silent cerebral ischemia were identified. CONCLUSION We demonstrated a reduced rate of silent cerebral infarcts following PED-Shield treatment of intracranial aneurysms than previously reported with other endovascular treatment modalities and with the previous device generations. Further research is necessary to evaluate our results and to identify methods to reduce the incidence of postprocedural cerebral ischemic events.","Pikis, Stylianos; Mantziaris, Georgios; Mamalis, Vasileios; Barkas, Konstantinos; Tsanis, Antonios; Lyra, Stavroula; Karkoulias, Kuriakos; Petrosyan, Tigran; Archontakis, Eftychios",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2019-015363; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31558655/,239

The aim was to explore how these care services have adapted during the pandemic in the UK and are providing care to people living with dementia (PLWD) and carers. METHOD Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted in June and July 2020 with 16 purposefully sampled unpaid dementia carers. Participants were asked about their experiences of accessing care services since the lockdown, and whether they were beneficial, if accessed at all. RESULTS Three themes were identified: (1) Impacts of no activities; (2) Difficulties accessing care during the pandemic; (3) Remote vs. face-to-face support. Loss of access to previously enjoyed activities and having had to shield for many PLWD is suggested to have led to severe physical and cognitive deteriorations, advancing the dementia. Where remote support was available, this was helpful to some, but did not replace the benefits of face-to-face support. Where PLWD were residing in a care home, carers had very limited remote access. CONCLUSIONS This is the first study to explore the impact on carers both from a community and institutionalised care angle. Few care services have adapted to providing remote support. With the vaccine taking time to be accessible to everyone, it is vital for organisations to work closely with carers and PLWD to adapt services to provide much needed support.","Giebel, Clarissa; Hanna, Kerry; Callaghan, Steve; Cannon, Jacqui; Butchard, Sarah; Shenton, Justine; Komuravelli, Aravind; Limbert, Stan; Tetlow, Hilary; Rogers, Carol; Eley, Ruth; Rajagopal, Manoj; Ward, Kym; Gabbay, Mark",Aging & mental health,https://doi.org/10.1080/13607863.2021.1914545; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33908284/,239

151012,Emergent laparoscopy in treatment of perforated peptic ulcer: a local experience from a tertiary centre in Saudi Arabia.,2013,"Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are a major cause of human respiratory tract infections and cause significant disease and mortality. Human IAVs originate from animal viruses that breached the host species barrier. IAV particles contain sialoglycan receptor-binding haemagglutinin (HA) and receptor-destroying neuraminidase (NA) in their envelope. When IAV crosses the species barrier, the functional balance between HA and NA needs to be adjusted to the sialoglycan repertoire of the novel host species. Relatively little is known about the role of NA in host adaptation in contrast to the extensively studied HA. NA prevents virion aggregation and facilitates release of (newly assembled) virions from cell surfaces as well as from decoy receptors abundantly present in mucus and cell glycocalyx. In addition to a highly conserved catalytic site, NA carries a second sialic acid-binding site (2SBS). The 2SBS preferentially binds α2,3-linked sialic acids, and enhances activity of the neighboring catalytic site by bringing/keeping multivalent substrates in close contact with this site. In this way, the 2SBS contributes to the HA-NA balance of virus particles and affects virus replication. The 2SBS is highly conserved in all NA subtypes of avian IAVs, with some notable exceptions associated with changes in the receptor-binding specificity of HA and host tropism. Conservation of the 2SBS is invariably lost in human (pandemic) viruses as well as in several other viruses adapted to mammalian host species. Preservation or loss of the 2SBS is likely to be an important factor of the viral host range.","Du, Wenjuan; de Vries, Erik; van Kuppeveld, Frank J M; Matrosovich, Mikhail; de Haan, Cornelis A M",The FEBS journal,https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.15668; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33314755/,239

METHODS Fourteen adult wistar rats 300 gr were randomized into two groups: Control group (n=7) and study group (n=7). All the rats underwent sleeve gastrectomy using lineer stapler. In the study group, fibrin glue was used to reinforce the staple-line. The rats were sacrificed 7 days after surgery. The stomach was resected, submerged in saline and exposed to excess pressure to obtain a burst pressure value. The gastric staple line was evaluated histopathologically according to the Ehrlich Hunt scale. The results of the two groups were compared. RESULTS The mean Ehrlich-Hunt scores for inflammation, fibroblastic activity and neo-angiogenesis were similar between the groups (p>0.05). Collagen deposition was significantly higher in study group (3.42±0.53) when compared with control group (2.57±0.78) (p=0.035). The mean burst pressure was 137.8±8.5 mmHg for control group and 135.0±8.1 mmHg for study group (p=0.536). CONCLUSION Reinforcement of the staple-line with fibrin glue has no effect on the burst pressure after sleeve gastrectomy.

CASE REPORT A 61-year-old man underwent endovascular repair of a large, symptomatic aortic arch aneurysm located distal to the left common carotid artery using a fenestrated endograft. Completion angiography showed bird-beak configuration of the proximal endograft and a large type Ia endoleak. In a separate procedure, the endoleak was embolized with cyanoacrylate glue via an antegrade ascending aortic access obtained through a transseptal sheath stabilized by an indwelling arteriovenous wire loop. This approach provided straight-line access into the endoleak with requisite catheter support, and complete thrombosis of the aneurysm sac was achieved. The patient's symptoms abated, and at 1-year follow-up, there was no endoleak, and the aneurysm sac had shrunken markedly.

Up to 13% of patients undergoing cross-sectional imaging studies for other indications are found to have pancreatic cystic lesions. Although most cystic lesions are benign, the malignant potential of several types of pancreatic cysts makes accurate classification vital to directing therapy. To this end, advances in the last decade led to better characterization of pancreatic cyst morphology and hence enhanced the ability to predict underlying histopathology, and biological behavior. Although accurate classification remains a challenge, the utilization of complementary diagnostic tools is the optimal approach to dictate management.

We sought to determine the impact of CKD on platelet reactivity in clopidogrel-treated patients and whether high platelet reactivity (HPR) confers a similar or differential risk for adverse events among patients with CKD and non-CKD. METHODS AND RESULTS We performed a post hoc analysis of the Assessment of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy With Drug-Eluting Stents (ADAPT-DES) registry, which included 8582 patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stents and platelet function testing using the VerifyNow assay. We compared HPR and its impact on ischemic and bleeding events >2 years among patients with CKD and non-CKD. Patients with CKD (n=1367) were older, more often female, diabetic, and had lower ejection fraction compared with their non-CKD counterparts (n=7043). Although HPR prevalence increased with worsening renal function in unadjusted analyses, these associations were no longer present after adjustment. Major adverse cardiac event rates at 2 years among those without CKD or HPR, HPR alone, CKD alone, and both CKD and HPR were 9.0%, 11.2%, 13.3%, and 17.5%, respectively (P<0.001). Associations between HPR and adverse events were uniform across CKD strata without evidence of interaction. CONCLUSIONS HPR is more common among those with versus without CKD, an association that is attributable to confounding risk factors that are more prevalent in CKD. The impact of HPR on ischemic and bleeding events is similar irrespective of CKD status. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

We present a case of treatment refractory depression with recent suicide attempt and active suicidal ideations who was on an Opioid partial agonist, Buprenorphine, for management of pain. Patient responded to a trial of IV ketamine treatment with rapid improvement in suicidal thoughts. Patient's suicidal ideations decreased after first Ketamine treatment and resolved after second treatment while maintained on Buprenorphine.

Our proposed application of safe-by-design can be part of ""responsible research and innovation"" concepts, because they share features such as risk prevention strategies and a participatory approach. Early awareness of potential safety issues can guide the development of agricultural products towards safe options, both at the process and product level, and thus may help to reduce extensive pre-market assessment studies that might otherwise be needed further downstream for regulatory product approval. Here, it is discussed how the proposed safe-by-design approach can be introduced into the development of safe food crops using emerging technologies, such as gene editing and synthetic biology, and how this may help to safeguard the safety of our food and feed supply in the light of the ongoing global innovations in agricultural crop breeding.","van der Berg, Jan Pieter; Kleter, Gijs A; Battaglia, Evy; Bouwman, Lianne M S; Kok, Esther J",International journal of environmental research and public health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17176420; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32899303/,239

Drug overdose deaths increased by 21% from 2015 to 2016, with two-thirds of these deaths attributed to opioid use disorder (OUD). This study assessed the psycho-social correlates associated with OUD over 2015-2018 in the US. Methods: This study used data collected from 171,766 (weighted = 245,838,163) eligible non-institutionalized US adults in the pooled National Survey on Drug Use and Health from 2015-2018. Survey-weighted descriptive, bivariate, and multivariable analyses were performed to assess the psycho-social correlates of OUD. Results: About 0.85% of the respondents reported having OUD in the past year. About one-quarter (26.3%), one-sixth (14.8%), and half (47.3%) of the respondents with OUD reported alcohol, marijuana, and nicotine dependence, respectively. One-sixth (16.7%) had a criminal justice involvement history, and almost one-third (30.8%) experienced a major depressive episode (MDE) in the past year. In multivariable analysis, ≤64 years, White race, male gender, lower educational attainment, unemployment, large metro area residence, history of alcohol, marijuana, nicotine use disorder, history of criminal justice involvement, and MDE in previous year were associated with higher odds of OUD. In contrast, being married, non-Hispanic African American, non-Hispanic Other, and Hispanic ethnicity, good physical health, private health insurance, and higher risk perception about addictive substance use were associated with lower odds of OUD. Conclusions: OUD is more prevalent among certain sociodemographic groups in the US. Targeted interventions focusing on young, White, unmarried, male, and uninsured/Medicaid/Medicare populations should be implemented to reduce the OUD.","Haider, Mohammad Rifat; Brown, Monique J; Gupta, Rajat Das; Karim, Sabrina; Olatosi, Bankole; Li, Xiaoming",Substance use & misuse,https://doi.org/10.1080/10826084.2020.1788086; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633664/,239

A cross-sectional study.,2020-07-15,"The routes of COVID-19 transmission to healthcare personnel from infected patients is the subject of debate, but is critical to the selection of personal protective equipment. The objective of this paper was to explore the contributions of three transmission routes-contact, droplet, and inhalation-to the risk of occupationally acquired COVID-19 infection among healthcare personnel (HCP). The method was quantitative microbial risk assessment, and an exposure model, where possible model parameters were based on data specific to the SARS-CoV-2 virus when available. The key finding was that droplet and inhalation transmission routes predominate over the contact route, contributing 35%, 57%, and 8.2% of the probability of infection, on average, without use of personal protective equipment. On average, 80% of inhalation exposure occurs when HCP are near patients. The relative contribution of droplet and inhalation depends upon the emission of SARS-CoV-2 in respirable particles (<10 µm) through exhaled breath, and inhalation becomes predominant, on average, when emission exceeds five gene copies per min. The predicted concentration of SARS-CoV-2 in the air of the patient room is low (< 1 gene copy per m3 on average), and likely below the limit of quantification for many air sampling methods. The findings demonstrate the value of respiratory protection for HCP, and that field sampling may not be sensitive enough to verify the contribution of SARS-CoV-2 inhalation to the risk of occupationally acquired COVID-19 infection among healthcare personnel.

Fractionation of mercury in sewage sludge and composts provides a better understanding of the extent of mobility and bioavailability of the different mercury species and helps in more informed decision making on the application of sludge for agricultural purposes. The experimental setup comprises the composing process of the sewage sludge containing 13.1mgkg-1 of the total mercury, performed in static reactors with forced aeration. In order to evaluate the bioavailability of mercury, its fractionation was performed in sewage sludge and composts during the process. An analytical procedure based on four-stage sequential extraction was applied to determine the mercury content in the ion exchange (water soluble and exchangeable Hg), base soluble (Hg bound to humic and fulvic acid), acid soluble (Hg bound to Fe/Mn oxides and carbonates) and oxidizable (Hg bound to organic matter and sulphide) fractions. The results showed that from 50.09% to 64.55% of the total mercury was strongly bound to organo-sulphur and inorganic sulphide; that during composting, increase of concentrations of mercury compounds strongly bound with organic matter and sulphides; and that mercury content in the base soluble and oxidizable fractions was strongly correlated with concentration of dissolved organic carbon in those fractions.","Janowska, Beata; Szymański, Kazimierz; Sidełko, Robert; Siebielska, Izabela; Walendzik, Bartosz",Environmental research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2017.04.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28407573/,239
158610,COVID-19 in Children With Cancer in New York City.,2020-05-13,"BACKGROUND In December 2019, the viral pandemic of respiratory illness caused by COVID-19 began sweeping its way across the globe. Several aspects of this infectious disease mimic metabolic events shown to occur during latent subclinical magnesium deficiency. Hypomagnesemia is a relatively common clinical occurrence that often goes unrecognized since magnesium levels are rarely monitored in the clinical setting. Magnesium is the second most abundant intracellular cation after potassium. It is involved in >600 enzymatic reactions in the body, including those contributing to the exaggerated immune and inflammatory responses exhibited by COVID-19 patients. METHODS A summary of experimental findings and knowledge of the biochemical role magnesium may play in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is presented in this perspective. The National Academy of Medicine's Standards for Systematic Reviews were independently employed to identify clinical and prospective cohort studies assessing the relationship of magnesium with interleukin-6, a prominent drug target for treating COVID-19. RESULTS Clinical recommendations are given for prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Constant monitoring of ionized magnesium status with subsequent repletion, when appropriate, may be an effective strategy to influence disease contraction and progression. The peer-reviewed literature supports that several aspects of magnesium nutrition warrant clinical consideration. Mechanisms include its ""calcium-channel blocking"" effects that lead to downstream suppression of nuclear factor-Kβ, interleukin-6, c-reactive protein, and other related endocrine disrupters; its role in regulating renal potassium loss; and its ability to activate and enhance the functionality of vitamin D, among others.

CONCLUSIONS Compared to CLSG, SILSG resulted in improved cosmetic satisfaction and showed no disadvantages in terms of surgical outcomes; thus, SILSG can serve as an alternative to CLSG for obese patients. Nonetheless, high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with large study populations and long follow-up periods are needed.","Sun, Si-Da; Wu, Ping-Ping; Zhou, Jun-Feng; Wang, Zhi-Sheng; Cai, Tian-Hong; Huang, Long-Kai; Chen, Jian-Sheng; Lin, Chang-Qing; Wang, Jia-Xing; He, Qing-Liang",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-020-04437-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32060852/,239

For this purpose, the levels of melanoma differentiation-associated protein-5 (MDA-5), retinoic acid inducible gene-1 (RIG-1), and Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR-3), TLR-7, TLR-8, and TLR-9 mRNAs were evaluated, using TaqMan quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, in cells from nasopharyngeal washes collected from 157 infants suffering from acute bronchiolitis whether or not they were associated with respiratory viruses. High interindividual variability was observed in both virus-positive and -negative infants; however, the relative gene expression levels of MDA-5, RIG-1, TLR-7, and TLR-8 were significantly higher in the virus-infected group, whereas the expression levels of TLR-3 and TLR-9 were not significantly different. The differences in the gene expression of MDA-5, RIG-1, TLR-7, and TLR-8 were more evident in infants with RSV infection than in those with bocavirus or rhinovirus infection. In RSV-infected infants, PRR-mRNA levels also were analyzed in relation to interferon protein levels, viral load, clinical severity, days of hospitalization, age, and body weight. A significant positive correlation was observed only between RSV viral load and RIG-1 mRNA levels. These findings provide the first direct evidence that, in infants with respiratory virus-associated bronchiolitis, especially RSV, there are substantial changes in PRR gene expression; this likely is an important determinant of the clinical outcome of bronchiolitis.","Scagnolari, Carolina; Midulla, Fabio; Pierangeli, Alessandra; Moretti, Corrado; Bonci, Enea; Berardi, Rosaria; De Angelis, Daniela; Selvaggi, Carla; Di Marco, Paola; Girardi, Enrico; Antonelli, Guido",Clinical and vaccine immunology : CVI,https://doi.org/10.1128/cvi.00445-08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19386802/,239

It is therefore important to understand how individuals with depression are interacting with patient portals, to ensure that they have access to tools that can improve outcomes. The purpose of the current retrospective analysis was to examine associations between symptom severity, demographic characteristics and patient portal adoption and use among Veterans with depression diagnoses. METHODS Data were collected within a larger retrospective analysis of use of the Veterans Health Administration patient portal, My HealtheVet (MHV). The final sample included 3053 Veterans with diagnoses of depression and at least two measures of depressive symptoms. Regressions tested whether depressive symptoms and demographic variables were associated with MHV registration and feature use. RESULTS Veterans with more severe depression were more likely to have registered for MHV and downloaded medical record content compared to those with milder symptoms. Maleand older Veterans had lower rates of portal registration, and African American Veterans had lower rates of portal feature use. LIMITATIONS Limitations include restriction to a Veteran population who first used MHV in FY2013 as opposed to prior or subsequent years. CONCLUSIONS Patients with more severe depression may have increased interest in and use of patient portals. Demographic differences in portal use continue to be observed; barriers to uptake must be identified so disparities can be addressed.","Connolly, Samantha L; Etingen, Bella; Shimada, Stephanie L; Hogan, Timothy P; Nazi, Kim; Stroupe, Kevin; Smith, Bridget M",Journal of affective disorders,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.073; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32734917/,239

Liver injury has been reported as a non-pulmonary manifestation of COVID-19 but characterization of liver test abnormalities and their association with clinical outcomes is incomplete. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 1827 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were hospitalized within the Yale-New Haven Health System (YNHHS) between March 14, 2020 and April 23, 2020. Clinical characteristics, liver tests (AST, ALT, ALP, TBIL, albumin) at three time points (pre-infection baseline, admission, peak hospitalization), and hospitalization outcomes (severe COVID-19, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, death) were analyzed. Abnormal liver tests were commonly observed in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, both at admission (AST 66.9%, ALT 41.6%, ALP 13.5%, TBIL 4.3%) and peak hospitalization (AST 83.4%, ALT 61.6%, ALP 22.7%, TBIL 16.1%). Most patients with abnormal liver tests at admission had minimal elevations 1-2x ULN (AST 63.7%, ALT 63.5%, ALP 80.0%, TBIL 75.7%). A significant proportion of these patients had abnormal liver tests pre-hospitalization (AST 25.9%, ALT 38.0%, ALP 56.8%, TBIL 44.4%). Multivariate analysis revealed an association between abnormal liver tests and severe COVID-19, including ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and death; associations with age, male gender, BMI, and diabetes mellitus were also observed. Medications used in COVID-19 treatment (lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, and tocilizumab) were associated with peak hospitalization liver transaminase elevations >5x ULN. Conclusion: Abnormal liver tests occur in most hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and may be associated with poorer clinical outcomes.","Hundt, Melanie A; Deng, Yanhong; Ciarleglio, Maria M; Nathanson, Michael H; Lim, Joseph K",Hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1002/hep.31487; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32725890/,239

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the efficacy of ovarian pedicle haemostasis by VS using a commercially available VS tool in open OVE and compare it with suture ligation (SL). A prospective, randomised clinical trial including 20 female dogs was designed. Open OVE was performed via a standard mid-line celiotomy by a single surgeon using a standardised protocol. At random, the right ovarian pedicle was sealed (VS) or ligated (SL) whereas the left pedicle was treated by the alternative technique. Surgical times for procedural stages and intra-operative complications were recorded and statistically evaluated. Total surgical time was 29.28±11.13 minutes (range 12.50-62.13 minutes) and time from identification to removal of the ovary was significantly less when sealing (VS 2.22±0.58 minutes) than when ligating (SL 4.10±1.13 minutes P=0.0001). Intra-operative complications were rare for both techniques (failure of the electrode of the VS device (n=3); ovarian pedicle haemorrhage due to ligature slippage (n=1)). The results of the current study indicate that ovarian pedicle haemostasis achieved by VS is significantly faster than by placement of ligatures without appearing to compromise safety.","Schwarzkopf, I; Van Goethem, B; Vandekerckhove, P M; de Rooster, H",The Veterinary record,https://doi.org/10.1136/vr.102693; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25344574/,239

METHODS The cameras included a 5-mm 30° laparoscope (LAP), a magnetically anchored (MAGS) camera, and a flexible endoscope (ENDO). The three camera systems were evaluated using standardized optical characteristic tests. Each system was used in random order for visualization during performance of a standardized suturing task by four surgeons. Each participant performed three to five consecutive repetitions as a surgeon and also served as a camera driver for other surgeons. Ex vivo testing was conducted in a laparoscopic multiport and SSL layout using a box trainer. In vivo testing was performed only in the multiport configuration and used a previously validated live porcine Nissen model. RESULTS Optical testing showed superior resolution for MAGS at 5 and 10 cm compared with LAP or ENDO. The field of view ranged from 39 to 99°. The depth of focus was almost three times greater for MAGS (6-270 mm) than for LAP (2-88 mm) or ENDO (1-93 mm). Both ex vivo and in vivo multiport combined surgeon performance was significantly better for LAP than for ENDO, but no significant differences were detected for MAGS. For multiport testing, workload ratings were significantly less ex vivo for LAP and MAGS than for ENDO and less in vivo for LAP than for MAGS or ENDO. For ex vivo SSL, no significant performance differences were detected, but camera drivers rated the workload significantly less for MAGS than for LAP or ENDO. CONCLUSION The data suggest that the improved imaging element of the next-generation MAGS camera has optical and performance characteristics that meet or exceed those of the LAP or ENDO systems and that the MAGS camera may be especially useful for SSL. Further refinements of the MAGS camera are encouraged.","Arain, Nabeel A; Cadeddu, Jeffrey A; Best, Sara L; Roshek, Thomas; Chang, Victoria; Hogg, Deborah C; Bergs, Richard; Fernandez, Raul; Webb, Erin M; Scott, Daniel J",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-2013-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22044976/,239

Here, we assessed SARS-CoV-2-Spike (S)-targeted antibody and functional T cell responses at around 6 months after complete vaccination. Methods: The sample comprised 46 residents (34 females; age, 60-100 years), of whom 10 had COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Baseline (median of 17.5 days after vaccination) and follow-up (median, 195 days) plasma specimens were available for quantitation of SARS-CoV-2-S antibodies and enumeration of SARS-CoV-2-S-reactive IFN-{gamma} CD4+ and CD8+ T cells by flow cytometry. Results: In total, 44/45 participants had detectable SARS-CoV-2-S antibodies at follow-up. Overall, antibody levels were found to decrease (median, 4.8 fold). Antibodies waning was more frequent (P<0.001) in SARS-CoV-2 naive (29/35) than in recovered (1/10) residents. SARS-CoV-2-S IFN-{gamma} CD8+ T cells were detected in 33/46 and 24/46 at baseline and follow-up, respectively. The figures for CD4+ T cell counterparts were 12/46 and 30/46. Detectable SARS-CoV-2 IFN-{gamma} CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses at follow-up were more common in recovered (8/10 and 7/10, respectively) than in naive residents (9/36 and 25/36, respectively). For those with detectable responses at both time points, SARS-CoV-2-S IFN-{gamma} CD8+ T cell frequencies decreased significantly (P=0.001) over time whereas the opposite (P=0.01) was observed in CD4+ T cells. Conclusion: Almost all residents displayed detectable SARS-CoV-2-S-reactive antibodies and T cell responses, respectively, by around 6 months after complete vaccination with Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccine, albeit generally waning in magnitude over time.

163735,People with Heart Disease have to be more Vigilant so as to Avoid COVID-19,2020,"To defend against fake news, researchers have developed various methods based on texts. These methods can be grouped as 1) pattern-based methods, which focus on shared patterns among fake news posts rather than the claim itself; and 2) fact-based methods, which retrieve from external sources to verify the claim's veracity without considering patterns. The two groups of methods, which have different preferences of textual clues, actually play complementary roles in detecting fake news. However, few works consider their integration. In this paper, we study the problem of integrating pattern- and fact-based models into one framework via modeling their preference differences, i.e., making the pattern- and fact-based models focus on respective preferred parts in a post and mitigate interference from non-preferred parts as possible. To this end, we build a Preference-aware Fake News Detection Framework (Pref-FEND), which learns the respective preferences of pattern- and fact-based models for joint detection. We first design a heterogeneous dynamic graph convolutional network to generate the respective preference maps, and then use these maps to guide the joint learning of pattern- and fact-based models for final prediction. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that Pref-FEND effectively captures model preferences and improves the performance of models based on patterns, facts, or both.","Sheng, Qiang; Zhang, Xueyao; Cao, Juan; Zhong, Lei",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.11333v1.pdf,239

Given that the Asia–Pacific region was the first to be impacted by the public health crisis, it is important to examine how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the real estate markets in this region and to assess how the region has been recovering since then. Our regression analysis, controlling for different macroeconomic fundamentals and city and property type fixed effects, documents substantial declines in rents of approximately 15% during the first six months of 2020 across the Asia–Pacific commercial property market. We further observe that the most significant declines in rent occur in regions where exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic is the more severe, and in the retail property sector, where we have been observing continued declines of over 30%, with little recovery as of the second quarter of 2020. In additional analysis, we examine capital values and show that while capital targeting the retail property sector has been muted, there is some evidence showing capital flows into the residential and industrial sectors. We also show that fiscal stimuli imposed by governments have moderated the adverse impact of the pandemic. Overall, our study shows that while the effect of the COVID-19 public health crisis is detrimental to commercial real estate, its impact varies significantly across different regions and property sectors.","Allan, Roddy Liusman Ervi Lu Teddy Tsang Desmond",Journal of Risk and Financial Management,https://doi.org/10.3390/jrfm14080360,239

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature on SARS-CoV-2 vaccine induced humoral and cell-mediated immune response in patients previously treated with anti-CD20 antibodies. Methods We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Medrxiv and SSRN using variations of search terms 'anti-CD20', 'vaccine' and 'COVID' and included original studies up to August 21st,2021. We excluded studies with missing data on humoral or cell-mediated immune response, unspecified methodology of response testing, unspecified timeframes between vaccination and blood sampling or low number of participants (n<=3). We excluded individual patients with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection or incomplete vaccine courses. Primary endpoints were humoral and cell-mediated immune response rates. Pre-specified subgroups were time of vaccination after anti-CD20 therapy (< vs > 6 months), time point of response testing after vaccination (< vs > 4 weeks) and disease entity (autoimmune vs cancer vs renal transplant). We used random-effects models of proportions. Findings Ninety studies were assessed. Inclusion criteria were met by 23 studies comprising 1342 patients. Overall rate of humoral response was 0.41 (95% CI 0.35-0.47). Overall rate of cell-mediated immune responses was 0.71 (95% CI 0.47-0.90). Longer time interval since last anti-CD20 therapy was associated with higher humoral response rates > 6 months 0.63 (95% CI 0.53-0.72) vs < 6 months 0.2 (95% CI 0.03-0.43); p = 0.001. Compared to patients with haematological malignancies or autoimmune diseases, anti-CD20 treated kidney transplant recipients showed the lowest vaccination response rates. Interpretation Patients on anti-CD20 therapies can develop humoral and cell-mediated immune responses after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, but subgroups such as kidney transplant recipients or those with very recent B-cell depleting therapy are at high risk for non-seroconversion and should be individually assessed for personalized SARS-CoV-2 vaccination strategies. Potential limitations are small patient numbers, heterogeneous diseases and assays used.

Researchers are now shifting their focus from resources to practices for delivering open education, an area called Open Educational Practices (OEP). However, there is little information in the related literature regarding the design of an OEP-based course or the impact of these types of courses. Therefore, this study designs a new OEP-based course at a public university for teaching family education during the COVID-19 pandemic. It also investigates its impact on learning motivation and teachers’ perceptions. In this context, a practical pilot experiment using both qualitative and quantitative methods was conducted. Specifically, 36 learners participated in this experiment. The obtained findings highlight: (1) an innovative design framework for OEP-based courses that teachers can refer to in their contexts;(2) that learners had a high motivation level in terms of knowledge achievements, individual connection and engagement when taking the OEP-based course;and (3) several advantages and challenges of the OEP-based course from the teacher’s and learners’ perspectives. For instance, the teacher reported the fear of losing control over the learning process when applying OEP. The findings of this paper can help researchers and educators in adopting OEP in higher education especially in times of crises, as well as increase the sustainability of OEP, hence contributing to open education development.","Zhang, Xiangling Tlili Ahmed Huang Ronghuai Chang Tingwen Burgos Daniel Yang Junfeng Zhang Jiacai",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su12219129,239

This pandemic has given rise to numerous public health and socioeconomic issues, emphasizing the significance of unraveling the epidemic’s history and forecasting the disease’s potential dynamics. A variety of mathematical models have been proposed to obtain a deeper understanding of disease transmission mechanisms. Machine Learning (ML) models have been used in the last decade to identify patterns and enhance prediction efficiency in healthcare applications. This paper proposes a model to predict COVID-19 patients admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). The model is built upon robust known classification algorithms, including classic Machine Learning Classifiers (MLCs), an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and ensemble learning. This model’s strength in predicting COVID-19 infected patients is shown by performance analysis of various MLCs and error metrics. Among other used ML models, the ANN model resulted in the highest accuracy, 97.9% over other models. Mean Squared Error showed that the ANN method had the lowest error (0.0809).

174425,"COVID-19 clinical course and outcomes in a predominantly black, vulnerable patient population in New York City",2021,"The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic has had major impacts on children's education, with schools required to implement infection control measures that have led to long periods of absence and classroom closures. We develop an agent-based epidemiological model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission that is applied to model infection within school classrooms, with a contact model constructed using random networks informed by structured expert judgement. Mitigation strategies to control infection are modelled to allow analysis of their effectiveness in supressing infection outbreaks and in limiting pupil absence. The model is applied to re-examine Covid-19 in schools in the UK in autumn 2020, and to forecast infection levels in autumn 2021 when the more infectious Delta-variant is dominant and school transmission is likely to play a major role in a new wave of the epidemic. Our results indicate that testing-based surveillance of infections in the classroom population with isolation of positive cases is a more effective mitigation measure than bubble quarantine both for reducing transmission in schools and for avoiding pupil absence, even accounting for insensitivity of self-administered tests. Bubble quarantine results in large numbers of pupils absent from school, with only modest impact of classroom infection. However, maintaining a reduced contact rate within the classroom has a major beneficial impact for managing Covid-19 in school settings.","Woodhouse, M. J.; Aspinall, W. P.; Sparks, S.

174436,A Retrospective audit comparing the neutropenic complications in the Pre-COVID and COVID era from a tertiary care center,2021,"Background: There is a growing recognition that strategies to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission should be responsive to local transmission dynamics. Studies have revealed inequalities along social determinants of health, but little investigation was conducted surrounding geographic concentration within cities. We quantified social determinants of geographic concentration of COVID-19 cases across sixteen census metropolitan areas (CMA) in four Canadian provinces. Methods: We used surveillance data on confirmed COVID-19 cases at the level of dissemination area. Gini (co-Gini) coefficients were calculated by CMA based on the proportion of the population in ranks of diagnosed cases and each social determinant using census data (income, education, visible minority, recent immigration, suitable housing, and essential workers) and the corresponding share of cases. Heterogeneity was visualized using Lorenz (concentration) curves. Results: Geographic concentration was observed in all CMAs (half of the cumulative cases were concentrated among 21-35% of each city's population): with the greatest geographic heterogeneity in Ontario CMAs (Gini coefficients, 0.32-0.47), followed by British Columbia (0.23-0.36), Manitoba (0.32), and Quebec (0.28-0.37). Cases were disproportionately concentrated in areas with lower income, education attainment, and suitable housing; and higher proportion of visible minorities, recent immigrants, and essential workers. Although a consistent feature across CMAs was concentration by proportion visible minorities, the magnitude of concentration by social determinants varied across CMAs. Interpretation: The feature of geographical concentration of COVID-19 cases was consistent across CMAs, but the pattern by social determinants varied. Geographically-prioritized allocation of resources and services should be tailored to the local drivers of inequalities in transmission in response to SARS-CoV-2's resurgence.","Xia, Y.; Ma, H.; Moloney, G.; Garcia, H.

This could lead unfortunately to a possible death if not treated well. Thus, this has increased the demand for the medical mechanical ventilators worldwide. The idea behind this work is development of a computational model for the study of the impact of different ventilation modes on patient's respiratory system generally, and lungs more specifically. This model has been created using Matlab/Simulink platform. The studied ventilation mode is the Pressure Controlled Ventilator (PCV) signal combined to single and two compartmental models in series and in parallel mathematical models configuration of the lungs that represent the respiratory system parameters for testing. The ventilator's setup includes the following parameters: positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), pressure wave, respiratory rate (RR), tidal volume, and others. By changing one of these parameters, we can monitor how this will affect the lungs by checking the volume, flow and PV loop for each lung mode. Simulation results have been recorded and are promising because this allows to study any type of ventilation modes conventional or novel ones virtually without the need to jeopardize the life of human subjects during clinical trials.","Jaber, M.; Hamawy, L.; Hajj-Hassan, M.; Abou Ali, M.; Kassem, A.; Ieee,",2020 32nd International Conference on Microelectronics,https://doi.org/10.1109/icm50269.2020.9331820,239

The perpetual mutational pattern in viruses topped with raising resistance to drug epitomizes the current situation as a trigger to explore nanotech platforms in antiviral therapies. Referring to novel physicochemical features of nanomaterials associated with effective drug delivery, it is viewed as an ideal strategy for treatment of viral infections. The coronavirus induced pathogenesis, including MERS, SARS and SARS-CoV-2 infections, has triggered alarming and highly dangerous precedents against existence of humans. Applications of nanotechnology can serve a new direction for disinfection or treatment of viruses. Presently, various types of nanomaterials, such as nanogels, nanospheres, nanocapsules, liposomes, nanoparticles and many others, that have been investigated in vivo and in vitro for successful drug delivery, vaccination, diagnostic assay and device development with anticipation to be translated in advanced clinical practices, need a collective relook.

Design - Retrospective cohort studies using a prevalent user design conducted in two distinct cohorts: individuals with type 2 diabetes and individuals with prediabetes. Setting - Insurance claims database for Medicare Advantage beneficiaries in the United States, 2018-2019. An identical analysis of commercial insurance beneficiaries appears in the supplement. Participants - 404,765 individuals with type 2 diabetes, 81,791 individuals with prediabetes. Main outcome measures - Total inpatient admission days in 2019, total medical spend (excluding prescription drugs) in 2019. Each of these measures is treated as a binary outcome: greater than zero inpatient days and top 10% medical spend. Results - We implement a common observational study design and observe a strong metformin effect estimate associated with reduced inpatient admissions and reduced medical expenditures; we also implement a more robust study design that suggests any estimated effect is attributable to residual confounding related to individuals' overall health. Conclusions - Common observational study designs examining metformin in a type 2 diabetes population are likely impacted by significant residual confounding. By additionally considering numerous negative control outcomes and a complementary prediabetes cohort, the study design proposed here demonstrates efficacy at exposing residual confounding related to overall health, nullifying the claim derived from a standard study design.

181552,Current Situation of Coronavirus Disease: (COVID-19) Review Article,2020,"The present study aims to investigate the effects of gum rosin (GR) microspheres coating over the hydrophobicity of the outer layer of a polypropylene (PP) based surgical face mask. The gum rosin coating was deposited over the surface of the face mask outer layer by electrospraying technique. The deposition of GR microspheres was confirmed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis. The thermal analysis determined a cooperative effect between the microspheres and the mask fibre to increase the maximum degradation rate temperature and the onset degradation temperature. To follow the effect of the GR microspheres coating over the hydrophobicity of the surgical face mask, FESEM and wettability analyses were conducted before and after 3, 6, and 9 h of wearing time. In the FESEM image, it was seen that the microsphere was homogeneously distributed over the nonwoven fibre and its presence increases the roughness of the fibres due to the bulge of microspheres. The wettability measurements suggest that the microspheres coating helps to keep the original hydrophobicity of the outer layer of the surgical face mask even after 6 h of wearing time. Indeed, after 9 h of wearing time, the water contact angle (WCA) of the GR coated face mask is higher than the WCA of the surgical face mask without the coating at 3 h of wearing time. Therefore, the gun rosin microspheres coating improved the hydrophobicity of the surgical face mask which may allow improved protection and/or extended lifetime of use. © 2021 The Author(s)","Pavon, C.; Aldas, M.; Rayón, E.; Arrieta, M.

However, with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the various restrictions imposed during the hard lockdown, the form and shape of grieving has had to change. Factors such as limitations on the number of people who can attend the funeral, lack of contact with the corpse, overall travel restrictions and shortened funeral services have contributed to how people mourn and grieve together. Using a psycho-theological framework, this article argues for the importance of giving serious consideration to both the psychological and spiritual well-being of mourners, specifically in the context of COVID-19. Drawing on an Afrocentric perspective and using a psychological and theological analysis, the article will examine grief, bereavement and mourning, and highlight the ways in which COVID-19 has affected these processes. This analysis will afford us the opportunity to redefine grieving as a psychological and theological response. Interdisciplinary and/or interdisciplinary implications: This article juxtaposes the theological perspectives with psychological perspectives in analysing the concept of grief during a pandemic.

We postulated that SD rats have enhanced hematogenous spread of Mycoplasma pulmonis to fetal tissues. METHOD OF STUDY WIS and SD dams were infected intravenously with 10(7), 10(6), and 10(5) colony-forming units of M. pulmonis at gestation day 14. Dams and six randomly selected fetuses were cultured at days 15, 16, 17, and 18 of gestation. RESULTS In the high-dose group, 100% of fetuses were colonized regardless of rat strain. Significantly higher numbers of M. pulmonis were isolated from placenta (low dose, P < 0.0001; medium dose, P < 0.024; high dose, P < 0.0001), amniotic fluid (low dose, P < 0.003; medium dose, P < 0.017), and fetuses (low dose, P < 0.0011) of SD rats. Spread of M. pulmonis to the amniotic fluid and fetus occurred 1 day earlier in SD rats. CONCLUSIONS The difference in susceptibility between the two rat strains cannot be explained by hematogenous spread alone. The relative resistance to adverse pregnancy outcomes in WIS rats may be a function of a more robust innate immune system.

To date, no pediatric study has focused on the effects of NAVA on hemodynamic parameters. This physiologic study with a randomized cross-over design compared hemodynamic parameters when NAVA or conventional ventilation (CV) was applied. METHODS After a baseline period, infants received NAVA and CV in a randomized order during two consecutive 30-min periods. During the last 10 min of each period, respiratory and hemodynamic parameters were collected. No changes in PEEP, FiO2, sedation or inotropic doses were allowed during these two periods. The challenge was to keep minute volumes constant, with no changes in blood CO2 levels and in pH that may affect the results. RESULTS Six infants who had undergone cardiac surgery (mean age 7.8 ± 4.1 months) were studied after parental consent. Four of them had low central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2 < 65 %). The ventilatory settings resulted in similar minute volumes (1.7 ± 0.4 vs. 1.6 ± 0.6 ml/kg, P = 0.67) and in similar tidal volumes respectively with NAVA and with CV. There were no statistically significant differences on blood pH levels between the two modes of ventilation (7.32 ± 0.02 vs. 7.32 ± 0.04, P = 0.34). Ventilation with NAVA delivered lower peak inspiratory pressures than with CV: -32.7 % (95 % CI: -48.2 to -17.1 %, P = 0.04). With regard to hemodynamics, systolic arterial pressures were higher using NAVA: +8.4 % (95 % CI: +3.3 to +13.6 %, P = 0.03). There were no statistically significant differences on cardiac index between the two modes of ventilation. However, all children with a low baseline ScvO2 (<65 %) tended to increase their cardiac index with NAVA compared to CV: 2.03 ± 0.30 vs. 1.91 ± 0.39 L/min.m2 (median ± interquartile, P = 0.07). CONCLUSIONS This pilot study raises the hypothesis that NAVA could have beneficial effects on hemodynamics in children when compared to a conventional ventilatory mode that delivered identical PEEP and similar minute volumes.

A 'primary' intramolecular polyprotein processing event mediated by 2A occurs at its own C terminus. FMDV 2A activity was studied in artificial polyproteins in which sequences encoding reporter proteins flanked the 2A sequence such that a single, long, open reading frame was created. The self-processing properties of these artificial polyproteins were investigated and the co-translational 'cleavage' products quantified. The processing products from our artificial polyprotein systems showed a molar excess of 'cleavage' product N-terminal of 2A over the product C-terminal of 2A. A series of experiments was performed to characterize our in vitro translation systems. These experiments eliminated the translational or transcriptional properties of the in vitro systems as an explanation for this imbalance. In addition, the processing products derived from a control construct encoding the P1P2 region of the human rhinovirus polyprotein, known to be proteolytically processed, were quantified and found to be equimolar. Translation of a construct encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP), FMDV 2A and beta-glucuronidase, also in a single open reading frame, in the presence of puromycin, showed this antibiotic to be preferentially incorporated into the [GFP2A] translation product. We conclude that the discrete translation products from our artificial polyproteins are not produced by proteolysis. We propose that the FMDV 2A sequence, rather than representing a proteolytic element, modifies the activity of the ribosome to promote hydrolysis of the peptidyl(2A)-tRNA(Gly) ester linkage, thereby releasing the polypeptide from the translational complex, in a manner that allows the synthesis of a discrete downstream translation product to proceed. This process produces a ribosomal 'skip' from one codon to the next without the formation of a peptide bond.","Donnelly, M L; Luke, G; Mehrotra, A; Li, X; Hughes, L E; Gani, D; Ryan, M D",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11297676/,239

The study involved 273 students of Kharkiv National Medical University: 47 men (17,2%) and 226 women (82,8%) aged 17 to 20. Age of 85% of respondents is 18-20 years old. 38 (13,9%) students are from 21 to 25 years old and 3 students (1,1%) - over 25 years old. RESULTS Results: A comparative analysis revealed the characteristic changes in the students' lifestyle. If under normal conditions the majority of students (63.7%) use their free time for walks outdoors, and 46.5% spend it at the computer, then during quarantine most respondents spend leisure time in front of a computer monitor (64.8%) or watching TV (71.4%). These indices were the result of a direct restriction on the interaction of students with the environment and the prohibition of their stay outside the zone of residence. CONCLUSION Conclusions: The most common negative changes of the students' health were sleep disturbances and headaches.The second most common symptoms are changes in the musculoskeletal system, associated mainly with physical inactivity. The third ones are deterioration of vision and psycho-emotional state of students.","Korobchansky, Volodymyr O; Oliinyk, Yuliia O; Nesterenko, Valentyna G; Sarkis-Ivanova, Vladyslava V; Hryhorian, Olena V",Wiadomosci lekarskie,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33843645/,239

A study was undertaken to investigate the importance of allergen exposure in sensitised individuals in combination with viral infections and other potentially modifiable risk factors precipitating asthma hospital admission in children. METHODS Eighty four children aged 3-17 years admitted to hospital over a 1 year period with an acute asthma exacerbation (AA) were matched for age and sex with two control groups: stable asthmatics (SA) and children admitted to hospital with non-respiratory conditions (IC). Risk factors were assessed by questionnaires and determination of allergen sensitisation, home allergen exposure, pollen exposure, and respiratory virus infection. RESULTS Several non-modifiable factors (atopy, duration of asthma) were associated with increased risk. Among the modifiable factors, pet ownership, housing characteristics, and parental smoking did not differ between the groups. Regular inhaled corticosteroid treatment was significantly less common in the AA group than in the SA group (OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.6; p = 0.002). A significantly higher proportion of the AA group were virus infected (44%) and sensitised and highly exposed to sensitising allergen (76%) compared with the SA (18% and 48%) and IC groups (17% and 28%; both p<0.001). In a multiple conditional logistic regression (AA v SA), allergen sensitisation and exposure or virus detection alone were no longer independently associated with hospital admission. However, the combination of virus detection and sensitisation with high allergen exposure substantially increased the risk of admission to hospital (OR 19.4, 95% CI 3.7 to 101.5, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Natural virus infection and real life allergen exposure in allergic asthmatic children increase the risk of hospital admission.

We examined whether treatment with CD40-activating Abs would block the development of Th2 cytokine responses and eosinophilic tissue pathology in this model. Seven days after C57BL/6 mice were injected with eggs and the FGK45 anti-CD40 Ab, Ag-specific synthesis of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 in lymph node culture was reduced (>10-fold) relative to control mice treated with eggs and rat IgG. In contrast, IFN-gamma and IL-12 were increased in both culture supernatants and in the serum. Similar changes in lymph node cytokine mRNA were observed in vivo, and tissue eosinophilia was reduced nearly 20-fold. Th2 cytokine responses in anti-CD40-treated IFN-gamma-/- and IL-12 p40-/- C57BL/6 mice were unaffected, although anti-CD40 induced high levels of systemic and local IFN-gamma production in both wild-type and IL-12 p40-/- mice. We conclude that CD40-activating treatments strongly reverse the immune phenotype generated in response to a classic, Th2-biasing stimulus and stimulate IFN-gamma through a novel IL-12-independent pathway. This model for Th1-deviating immune therapy may have relevance to the treatment of Th2-dependent diseases in general.","Martin, D L; King, C L; Pearlman, E; Strine, E; Heinzel, F P",Journal of immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10623823/,239

Using a defective interfering (DI) RNA-like cDNA construct derived from pMH54, 690 nucleotides representing the entire M gene and the 5' most 915 nucleotides of the N gene of the mouse hepatitis virus Albany 4 mutant were attempted to be replaced. Upon infection of cells with Albany 4 followed by transfection with synthetic RNA transcribed from the DI-like cDNA construct, recombinant mouse hepatitis viruses as the large plaque forming phenotype were isolated by plaque assays at the non-permissive temperature of 391 degrees C. By RT-PCR and sequencing, those large plaque phenotypes were confirmed to have contained the thermostable phenotype marker derived from the transfected RNA, demonstrating that recombination occurred between the Albany 4 genomic RNA and the in vitro RNA transcripts. Further analysis of the recombinant viruses indicated that there combination had taken place within the region of 222 nucleotides between positions 916 and 1,137 of the N gene. This is the region immediately downstream of the replacement sequence and the start of the temperature resistant phenotype marker. The results suggest that the M and part of the N genes of bovine coronavirus may not be able to complement the function of those of mouse hepatitis virus. This study redirects our current approach of utilizing the MHV targeted RNA recombination as a means to study bovine coronavirus genetics towards the construction of an infectious cDNA clone.","Koljesar, G; Yoo, D",Journal of veterinary science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12441693/,239

This study determined the incidence of SARS transmission to HCWs who intubated patients and analyzed the concerns of HCWs regarding personal and patient safety. METHODS Healthcare workers who performed tracheal intubation in 10 Toronto hospitals were identified using the Ontario Public Health database. A questionnaire was used to collect information from the HCWs. To determine if the patterns of personal protection or concerns changed over time, data were analyzed according to whether the intubation occurred during SARS 1 (February 23 to April 21) or SARS 2 (April 22 to July 1). RESULTS Thirty-three HCWs who performed 39 intubations on 35 SARS patients were interviewed. Three of 23 HCWs (13%) acquired SARS during SARS 1 whereas none (0/10) acquired SARS during SARS 2. Personal protection increased from SARS 1 to SARS 2 and HCWs' concerns changed over time. During SARS 1, concerns focused on the need for personal protective equipment whereas during SARS 2, concerns focused on the need for strict training and patient care protocols. HCWs perceived that their experiences were ineffectively integrated into risk management protocols. CONCLUSIONS Protection guidelines failed to completely prevent the transmission of SARS to HCWs. Nine percent of the interviewed HCWs who intubated patients contracted SARS. A Risk Analysis Framework is presented to facilitate the rapid integration of HCWs' experiences into practice guidelines.","Caputo, Karen M; Byrick, Robert; Chapman, Martin G; Orser, Barbara J; Orser, Beverley A",Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16434750/,239

We assessed toilet plume aerosol from high efficiency (HET), pressure-assisted high efficiency (PAT), and flushometer (FOM) toilets with similar bowl water and flush volumes. Total and droplet nuclei ""bioaerosols"" were assessed. Monodisperse 0.25-1.9- μ m fluorescent microspheres served as microbe surrogates in separate trials in a mockup 5 m3 water closet (WC). Bowl water seeding was approximately 1012 particles/mL. Droplet nuclei were sampled onto 0.2- μ m pore size mixed cellulose ester filters beginning 15 min after the flush using open-face cassettes mounted on the WC walls. Pre- and postflush bowl water concentrations were measured. Filter particle counts were analyzed via fluorescent microscopy. Bowl headspace droplet count size distributions were bimodal and similar for all toilet types and flush conditions, with 95% of droplets <2μm diameter and>99%<5μ m. Up to 145,000 droplets were produced per flush, with the high-energy flushometer producing over three times as many as the lower energy PAT and over 12 times as many as the lowest energy HET despite similar flush volumes. The mean numbers of fluorescent droplet nuclei particles aerosolized and remaining airborne also increased with flush energy. Fluorescent droplet nuclei per flush decreased with increasing particle size. These findings suggest two concurrent aerosolization mechanisms-splashing for large droplets and bubble bursting for the fine droplets that form droplet nuclei.","Johnson, David; Lynch, Robert; Marshall, Charles; Mead, Kenneth; Hirst, Deborah",Aerosol science and technology : the journal of the American Association for Aerosol Research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26635429/,239

The objective was to describe the incidence rates trend in native and foreign population (2009-2018) in Madrid Region. METHODS Retrospective analysis of cases from the Tuberculosis Regional Registry of cases of Madrid Region 2009-2018. Annual incidence rates were calculated by country of birth (Spain, other), sex and age group (<15, 15-34, 35-44, 45-64, >64), using the annual January 1st continuous register population. The infection rate trend and the annual percentage change (APC) were calculated, along with the best jointpoint adjustment using Jointpoint regression. RESULTS 7,696 cases were analyzed, 48.2% were foreign-born individuals. Average age in native population was 50 years old (SD: 23.96) and 35 (DS: 36.64) in foreign-born individuals (p<0.001). The overall incidence rate decreased from 17.30 in 2009 to 9.00 per 100,000 in 2018 and was higher in men. Pulmonary tuberculosis reduced from 11.90 to 6.55. Among native population, the incidence of TB fell from 10.29 to 5.24 with an APC of -7.3% (95%IC: -8.9; -5.7) (p<0.05), no jointpoint was identified. Among foreign-born individuals the incidence of tuberculosis declined from 46.54 to 25.49, a joint point was identified in 2013, observing an incidence decrease for the period 2009-2013 and APC of -13.8% (IC95%: -17.5; -10.0). CONCLUSIONS The global incidence rate in this period has decreased by approximately 7% per year. However, this reduction occurred mainly in native population. In foreign-born individuals the incidence decreased by approximately 14% during the 2009-2013 period, after this period there have been no significant incidence changes.","Pichiule Castañeda, Myrian; Rodero Garduño, Inmaculada; Febrel Bordeje, Consuelo; Ribeiro Alexandre D Auria de Lima, Mónica Cristina; Rodríguez Baena, Elena; Córdoba Deorador, Esther; Sánchez Díaz, Jesús; Gil Montalbán, Elisa; Barbas Del Buey, José; Jiménez Bueno, Susana; Zamora Sarabia, Ana; Aragón Peña, Andrés; Velasco Rodríguez, Manuel; Martín Martínez, Fernando; García Marín, Natividad; Mata Pariente, Nelva; Rumayor Zarzuelo, Mercedes; Pérez Meixeira, Ana; Miguel Benito, Ángel; Sanz Ortiz, Carmen; Ordobás Gavín, M",Revista espanola de salud publica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32986021/,239

201793,Rapid development of seizures and PRES in a Covid-19 patient,2021,"Pesticides are used in agriculture to protect crops. Its widespread use in agriculture represents a threat not only to the environment but also to human populations exposed to them. Erythrocytes serve as an excellent model system to study the interaction of pro-oxidants. Organocarbamates are known to produce free radical species and to induce toxicity to different body systems resulting into hematological and biochemical perturbations. The information available relating to the effect of organocarbamates on the biochemical indices of human erythrocytes is scanty. Therefore, the present study was carried out to evaluate the impact of carbofuran, a carbamate pesticide, on some key biochemical indices of human erythrocytes' membrane. The oxidative potential of the pesticide was assessed in vitro by monitoring the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) in human erythrocytes exposed to different sub-acute concentrations (0, 2.5, 5, 10, 25 and 50μM) of carbofuran for different time intervals; maximally up to 120 min. It was observed that the level of MDA was elevated and that of GSH was significantly decreased after treatment of erythrocytes with carbofuran. The results indicated the negative impact of carbofuran in concentration and time dependent manner. Carbofuran was also found to sharply inhibit the activity of membrane bound Na(+)K(+)-ATPase at higher carbofuran concentrations (10, 25 and 50μM). Further, carbofuran at aforesaid concentrations was also found to cause significant rise in the osmotic fragility of human erythrocytes indicating adverse effect on membrane fluidity. The results of present study suggested that carbofuran was able to alter the oxidative balance and the stability of human erythrocytes membrane.","Sharma, R K; Jaiswal, S K; Siddiqi, N J; Sharma, B",Cellular and molecular biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23273198/,239

All virus strains produced a cytopathic effect (CPE) with cell-to-cell fusion in B16, DBT, IC-21 and J774A.1 cells. The CPE was induced most rapidly in IC-21 cells and was visible microscopically in all cell lines tested. In contrast, the coronaviruses produced little CPE in A3-1M and CMT-93 cells. Although most virus-infected cells, except KQ3E-infected A3-1M, CMT-93 and J774A.1 cells, produced progeny viruses in the supernatants when assayed by plaque formation on DBT cells, the kinetics of viral replication were dependent on both the cell line and virus strain; replication of prototype strains was higher than that of new isolates. There was no significant difference in replication of enterotropic and polytropic strains. B16 cells supported the highest level of viral replication. To determine the sensitivity of the cell lines to murine coronaviruses, the 50% tissue culture infectious dose of the coronaviruses was determined with B16, DBT, IC-21 and J774A.1 cells, and compared to that with DBT cells. The results indicate that IC-21 cells were the most sensitive to murine coronaviruses. These data suggest that B16 and IC-21 cells are suitable for large-scale preparation and isolation of murine coronaviruses, respectively.","Kyuwa, S; Ohsawa, K; Sato, H; Urano, T",Experimental animals,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11109550/,239

An insight into a potential new therapy,2020,"Semliki Forest virus RNA replication takes place in association with specific cytoplasmic vacuoles, derived from the endosomal apparatus. Of the four virus-encoded replicase proteins, nsP1 serves as the membrane anchor of the replication complex. An amphipathic peptide segment, G245STLYTESRKLLRSWHLPSV264, has been implicated in the membrane binding of nsP1. nsP1 variants with changes within the peptide were studied after protein expression and in the context of virus infection. Proteins with mutations R253E and W259A accumulated in the cytoplasm and were very poorly palmitoylated. The same mutations also drastically affected the localization of the precursor polyprotein P123, and they were lethal when introduced into the virus genome. Mutations R253A and L255A+L256A partially changed the localization of nsP1, and the respective viruses acquired compensatory changes. L255A+L256A only yielded virus encoding L255A+L256V, indicating the importance of a hydrophobic residue in the central 256 position. When fused to green fluorescent protein, the peptide was required in at least two tandem copies to effect a change in localization, but even then the fusion protein was associated with membranes in a nonspecific manner. Thus, the amphipathic peptide is a crucial element for the membrane association of nsP1 and the replication complex. It provides essential affinity for membranes, and other regions of nsP1 also appear to contribute to the localization of the protein.","Spuul, Pirjo; Salonen, Anne; Merits, Andres; Jokitalo, Eija; Kääriäinen, Leevi; Ahola, Tero",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17093195/,239

207441,Psychological distress among cancer survivors during implementation of a nationwide Movement Control Order over the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"AimsThe ability to communicate effectively is an imperative skill for clinicians to master as doctor-patient communication is one of the most essential dynamics in health care. Patients with a mental disorder present a unique challenge for doctors with regards to effective communication due to the nature of their illness.This literature review aimed to determine whether medical undergraduates around the world are taught psychiatric communication skills.MethodIn January 2021, the following electronic databases were searched for articles relating to medical undergraduates, the concept of psychiatric communication skills and the teaching and support of such skill development: ERIC, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, SAGE and Web of Science. Combinations of keywords focussed the content of papers and truncation obtained alternative word endings. Generated articles were appraised iteratively for suitability against pre-defined inclusion criteria. The bibliographies of eligible articles were then examined to capture any further relevant studies. Ethical approval was not required.Result1040 citations of potential relevance were initially identified. Following an iterative screening process, 10 articles (from seven different countries) were eligible for inclusion. 70% of papers used the modality of simulated patients to teach psychiatric communication skills and Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) was used to create “virtual patients” for undergraduates to engage with. Discussing sensitive and emotive topics, such as suicide attempts or substance misuse, was less commonly taught compared to conditions such as anxiety and depression. Only 10% of papers explicitly taught medical undergraduates empathy or written communication skills and the importance placed on psychiatric teaching differed between countries.ConclusionThis literature review showed that some medical undergraduates receive psychiatric communication skills teaching, but the format and content of this varies. Increased consideration of incorporating TEL into psychiatric communications skills teaching is pertinent given undergraduates’ reduced face-to-face patient contact during the COVID-19 pandemic, but further work is needed to validate such technology. Written communication skills are rarely taught but are imperative given the high volume of written correspondence in clinical practice. Delivering such teaching is feasible and should be incorporated into undergraduate curricula. Medical educators need to consider cultural differences when developing psychiatric communication skills teaching. Cultural influences not only affect undergraduate perceptions of psychiatry and mental illness, but also a patient's understanding and interpretation of their illness experience. Medical undergraduates may come from various cultural backgrounds, so actively discussing these differences opportunistically may augment the ability of medical undergraduates to be empathetic and establish therapeutic rapport with patients with mental illness.","Winfield, Sarah Hyland Declan",BJPsych Open,,239

207712,Decision Making: Physical Therapist Intervention for Patients With COVID-19 in a Geriatric Setting,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the 2013 nerve conduction study (NCS) reimbursement reduction changed Medicare utilization, payments, and patient access to Medicare physicians, we performed a retrospective analysis of Medicare data (2012-2016 fee-for-service data from the CMS Physician and Other Supplier Public Use File). METHODS: Individual billable services were identified by Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System CPT and G codes. Medicare utilization and payments were stratified by specialty and type of service (electrodiagnostic tests, including NCS and electromyography (EMG), and other neurologic procedures). We also assessed access to Medicare physicians using the annual number of unique beneficiaries receiving initial Evaluation and Management (E/M) services. RESULTS: We identified 676,113 Medicare providers included in all analysis years from 2012-2016 (10,599 neurologists, 5,881 physiatrists, and 659,633 other specialties). Comparing 2016to 2012, 21.1% fewer neurologists, 28.6% fewer physiatrists, and 69.3% fewer other specialists performed NCS and 3.8% fewer neurologists, 21.7% fewer physiatrists, and 5.6% fewer other specialists performed EMG. For NCS providers in 2012, the mean number of unique Medicare beneficiaries increased for neurologists (1.2%) and physiatrists (4.8%) but decreased for other specialists (-6.5%) by 2016. Following the NCS cut, the number of providers performing autonomic and evoked potential testing increased substantially. CONCLUSIONS: The Medicare NCS reimbursement policy resulted in a larger decrease in NCS providers than in EMG providers. Despite fewer neurologists and physiatrists performing NCS, Medicare access to these physicians for E/M services was not affected. Increased autonomic and evoked potential testing may be an unintended consequence of NCS reimbursement change.","Reynolds, Evan L; Kerber, Kevin A; Hill, Chloe; De Lott, Lindsey B; Magliocco, Brandon; Esper, Gregory J; Callaghan, Brian C",Neurology,,239
207893,Empirical Assessment of Mandatory Stay-at-Home and Business Closure Effects on the Spread of COVID-19 (preprint),2021,"AIM: This paper describes the situation regarding COVID-19 emergency in France as of early May 2020, the main policies to fight this virus, and the roles and responsibilities of nurses regarding their work at this time, as well as the challenges facing the profession. BACKGROUND: Europe continues to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time of writing France was the fourth country with the highest number of detected cases and cumulative deaths. SOURCES OF EVIDENCE: Websites of the World Health Organization, French Government, French Agency of Public Health, French National Council of Nurses and ClinicalTrials.gov database, as well as the experiences of the authors. DISCUSSION: The history of the development of the pandemic in France helps explain the establishment of the state of health emergency and containment of the population. Many decisions made had undesirable repercussions, particularly in terms of intra-family violence, mental health disorders and the renunciation of care. Hospitals and primary care services, with significant investment by nurses, played a key role in the care of persons with and without COVID-19. CONCLUSION: France has suffered a very high toll in terms of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, and effects on its people, health systems and health professionals, including nurses. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Nurses are recognized for their social usefulness in France. However, it is important to consider the collateral effects of this crisis on nurses and nursing and to integrate the health emergency nursing skills established during the pandemic into the standard field of nursing competence. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING POLICY: The nursing profession has expectations of a reflection on and revision of nursing skills as well as of its valorization in the French healthcare system, notably carried out by the French National Council Order of Nurses.","Chamboredon, P; Roman, C; Colson, S",Int Nurs Rev,,239

A central question concerning COVID-19 is why some individuals become sick and others not. Many have pointed already at variation in risk factors between individuals. However, the variable outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infections may, at least in part, be due also to differences between the viral subspecies with which individuals are infected. A more pertinent question is how we are to overcome the current pandemic. A vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 would offer significant relief, although vaccine developers have warned that design, testing and production of vaccines may take a year if not longer. Vaccines are based on a handful of different designs (i), but the earliest vaccines were based on the live, attenuated virus. As has been the case for other viruses during earlier pandemics, SARS-CoV-2 will mutate and may naturally attenuate over time (ii). What makes the current pandemic unique is that, thanks to state-of-the-art nucleic acid sequencing technologies, we can follow in detail how SARS-CoV-2 evolves while it spreads. We argue that knowledge of naturally emerging attenuated SARS-CoV-2 variants across the globe should be of key interest in our fight against the pandemic.","Armengaud, Jean; Delaunay-Moisan, Agnès; Thuret, Jean-Yves; van Anken, Eelco; Acosta-Alvear, Diego; Aragón, Tomás; Arias, Carolina; Blondel, Marc; Braakman, Ineke; Collet, Jean-François; Courcol, René; Danchin, Antoine; Deleuze, Jean-François; Lavigne, Jean-Philippe; Lucas, Sophie; Michiels, Thomas; Moore, Edward R B; Nixon-Abell, Jonathon; Rossello-Mora, Ramon; Shi, Zheng-Li; Siccardi, Antonio G; Sitia, Roberto; Tillett, Daniel; Timmis, Kenneth N; Toledano, Michel B; van der Sluijs, Peter; Vicenzi, Elisa",Environ Microbiol,,239

Reasons for this failure to rate include widespread use of social media and news aggregators. The majority of links that could be rated came from credible sources; however, we found a large increase in the proportion of state-sponsored propaganda among non-credible and less credible URLs, suggesting that COVID-19 may be used as a vector to spread misinformation and disinformation for political purposes. Overall, results indicate that COVID-19 is unfolding in a highly uncertain information environment that not may amenable to fact-checking as scientific understanding of the disease, and appropriate public health measures, evolve.

211878,Measuring Awareness of Infection Control Guidelines for Patients with COVID-19 in Radiology Departments in Saudi Arabia,2021,"Importance: People in the US have been seeking self-managed abortions outside the formal health care system using medications obtained through online telemedicine. However, little is known about this practice, including potential motivating factors. Objective: To examine individual reasons for accessing medication abortion through an online telemedicine service as well as associations between state- and county-level factors and the rate of requests. Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based cross-sectional study examined all requests for self-managed medication abortion through an online consultation form available from Aid Access, a telemedicine service in the US, between March 20, 2018, and March 20, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Individual-level reasons for accessing the telemedicine service were examined as well as the rate of requests per 100â¯000 women of reproductive age by state. Zip code data provided by individuals making requests were used to examine county-level factors hypothesized to be associated with increased demand for self-managed abortion: distance to a clinic (calculated using location data for US abortion clinics) and the population proportion identifying as a member of a racial/ethnic minority group, living below the federal poverty level, and having broadband internet access (calculated using census data). Results: During the 2-year study period, 57â¯506 individuals in 2458 counties in 50 states requested self-managed medication abortion; 52.1% were aged 20 to 29 years (mean [SD] age, 25.9 [6.7] years), 50.0% had children, and 99.9% were 10 weeks' pregnant or less. The most common reasons cited by individuals making requests were the inability to afford in-clinic care (73.5%), privacy (49.3%), and clinic distance (40.4%). States with the highest rate of requests were Louisiana (202.7 per 100â¯000 women) and Mississippi (199.9 per 100â¯000 women). At the county level, an increase of 1 SD (47 miles) in distance to the nearest clinic was significantly associated with a 41% increase in requests (incidence rate ratio, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.31-1.51; P < .001), and a 10% increase in the population living below the federal poverty level was significantly associated with a 20% increase in requests (incidence rate ratio, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.13-1.28; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study, clinic access barriers were the most commonly cited reason for requesting self-managed medication abortion using an online telemedicine service. At the county level, distance to an abortion clinic and living below the federal poverty level were associated with a higher rate of requests. State and federal legislation could address these access barriers.","Aiken, Abigail R A; Starling, Jennifer E; Gomperts, Rebecca",JAMA Netw Open,,239

212086,Use of virtual reality in the inpatient rehabilitation of COVID-19 patients,2021,"BACKGROUND: There's an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection since December 2019, first in China, and currently with more than 80 thousand confirmed infection globally in 29 countries till March 2, 2020. Identification, isolation and caring for patients early are essential to limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events. The RT-PCR detection of viral nucleic acid test (NAT) was one of the most quickly established laboratory diagnosis method in a novel viral pandemic, just as in this COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: 4880 cases that had respiratory infection symptoms or close contact with COVID-19 patients in hospital in Wuhan, China, were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection by use of quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) on samples from the respiratory tract. Positive rates were calculated in groups divided by genders or ages. RESULTS: The positive rate was about 38% for the total 4880 specimens. Male and older population had a significant higher positive rates. However, 57% was positive among the specimens from the Fever Clinics. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that age, not gender, was the risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection in fever clinics. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, we concluded that viral NAT played an important role in identifying SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Liu, Rui; Han, Huan; Liu, Fang; Lv, Zhihua; Wu, Kailang; Liu, Yingle; Feng, Yong; Zhu, Chengliang",Clin Chim Acta,,239
212087,Use of virtual reality in the inpatient rehabilitation of COVID-19 patients,2021,"Very few studies have been concerned with assessing the prevalence of burnout and depressive symptoms, especially during an infectious outbreak on non-frontline health care workers, such as a psychiatrist. In such instances, the role of psychiatrists and other mental health providers as a source of psychological support to the public and frontline workers is indispensable and valuable. This study aims to assess the prevalence of burnout and depressive symptoms, and their correlation, during the COVID-19 pandemic among psychiatry residents in Saudi Arabia. A total of 121 out of 150 psychiatry residents in Saudi Arabia completed the Maslach Burnout Inventory and Patient's Health Questionnaire for the assessment of burnout and depressive symptoms. Burnout symptoms were found in 27.3%, and another 27.3% reported having depression symptoms. In addition, 16.5% reported having both burnout and depressive symptoms, with a significant relationship between them. Participants in the first 2 years of training and having a history of receiving mental health treatment in the past 2 years were at higher risk. The need is urgent to increase investment in mental health services and to construct a plan to reduce this risk of burnout and depression among psychiatrists by developing preventative strategies to prevent burnout and promote wellness is more important than ever.","Alkhamees, Abdulmajeed A; Assiri, Hatem; Alharbi, Hatim Yousef; Nasser, Abdullah; Alkhamees, Mohammad A",Hum Resour Health,,239

We show how the momentous events set in motion by the COVID-19 virus, and the structural drivers of inequity and racism that its spread exposed, challenge mental health research on gun trauma to better account for broader terrains of race and place, as well as the tensions, politics, and assumptions that surround guns in the U.S. more broadly. Doing so will broaden mental-health interventions into epidemics of U.S. gun trauma, and challenge mental health research better recognize structural biases inherent in its own purview. We frame the agenda through the rubric of structural competency, an emerging framework that systematically trains health care professionals and others to recognize ways that institutions, neighborhood conditions, market forces, public policies, and health care delivery systems shape symptoms and diseases. Developing a structural framework around research into U.S. gun violence addresses the risks, traumas, meanings, and consequences that firearms represent for all communities-and highlights the importance of a renewed focus on mental health and safety for communities of color. Recognizing how gun violence reflects and encapsulates structures helps mental health experts address common sense gun policies within broader contexts-by fighting against structural racism or racially inflected gun policies for instance, or against economic policies that undermine access to mental health care more broadly.","Metzl, Jonathan M; McKay, Tara; Piemonte, Jennifer L",Soc Sci Med,,239

217629,White Counties Stand Apart: The Primacy of Residential Segregation in COVID-19 and HIV Diagnoses,2020,"National and international strategies and recommendations are intended to increase physical activity in the general population. Active transportation is included in interdisciplinary strategies to meet these recommendations. Cycling seems to be more health enhancing than walking for transportation since cycling seems to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and associated risk factors. Furthermore, the health benefits of cycling are proven to outrun the risk of injuries and mortality. Politicians seem to approve costly infrastructure strategies to increase the amount of cycling in the population to improve public health and shift to more sustainable travel habits. A linear relationship between cycle-friendly infrastructure and the amount of commuter cycling has been demonstrated. However, in Norway and on a global level, there is a lack of robust evaluations of actions and sensitive monitoring systems to observe possible change. Therefore, we aimed to develop the Norwegian bike traffic index and describe the national, regional, and local trends in counted cycle trips. We used a transparent methodology so that the index can be used, developed, and adapted in other countries. We included 89 stationary counters from the whole country. Counters monitored cycling from 2018 onward. The index is organized at local, regional, and national levels. Furthermore, the index is adjusted for population density at the counter level and presented as ratio of counted cycle trips, comparing 2018 to subsequent years. The index is presented as a percentage change with 95% confidence intervals. In Norway, counted cycle trips increased by 11% from 2018 (100, 100-100) to 2020 (111.0, 106.2-115.1), with large geographical differences. In Southern Norway, there was a significant increase of 23%, and in Northern Norway, there was a nonsignificant decrease by 8% from 2018 to 2020. The indices may indicate possible related effects of local to national cycling strategies and how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected Norwegian travel habits in urban areas.","Nordengen, Solveig; Andersen, Lars Bo; Riiser, Amund; Solbraa, Ane K",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,239

Many reports have enough evidence for the use of FDA-approved drugs which have inhibitory potential against target proteins of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here, we utilized a structure-based drug design approach to find possible drug candidates from the existing pool of FDA-approved drugs and checked their effectiveness against the SARS-CoV-2. We performed virtual screening of the FDA-approved drugs against the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2, an essential enzyme, and a potential drug target. Using well-defined computational methods, we identified Glecaprevir and Maraviroc (MVC) as the best inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Both drugs bind to the substrate-binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and form a significant number of non-covalent interactions. Glecaprevir and MVC bind to the conserved residues of substrate-binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. This work provides sufficient evidence for the use of Glecaprevir and MVC for the therapeutic management of COVID-19 after experimental validation and clinical manifestations.","Shamsi, Anas; Mohammad, Taj; Anwar, Saleha; AlAjmi, Mohamed F; Hussain, Afzal; Rehman, Md Tabish; Islam, Asimul; Hassan, Md Imtaiyaz",Biosci. rep,,239

Since the original ACE (Anevrysme de l'aorte abdominale: Chirurgie versus Endoprothese) randomised control trial, studies of French specific population have also contributed significantly to the body of evidence in support of endovascular abdominal aortic repair. METHODS: In the ENDURANT France registry, 180 patients were consecutively enrolled from 20 French centres starting in 2012. Investigational sites included public and private practice and differing centre volumes to be as representative of real world French experience as possible. The aim of this study was to present the five year outcomes from this registry. RESULTS: Instructions for use (IFU) were respected in 97.8% (176/180) of patients. At five years, the Kaplan-Meier overall survival was 69.9% ± 3.5% and the freedom from aneurysm related death was 97.6% ± 1.2%. The freedom from Type IA endoleaks was 94.5% ± 1.7%, freedom from endoleaks of any type was 70.1 ± 3.4%, and freedom from secondary endovascular procedure 90.4% ± 2.6%. In addition, 61.6% (45/73) of patients exhibited sac shrinkage at five years. CONCLUSION: In this five year report of the Endurant France registry, survival, re-intervention, and freedom from endoleak rates were comparable to recent EVAR registries and there was a high sac shrinkage rate. Secondary procedure and aneurysm rupture were lower than those of ACE, the French RCT which included older generation devices. This prospective registry demonstrates favourable five year outcomes of the Endurant stent graft used within IFU.","Becquemin, Jean-Pierre; Haupert, Serge; Issam, Farah; Dubar, Arnaud; Martelloni, Yvan; Jousset, Yann; Sauguet, Antoine",Eur. j. vasc. endovasc. surg,,239

METHODS: In thisretrospective, multicenter study, the medical records of elderly patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in Hunan province, China, from January 21 to February 19, 2020 were reviewed. The characteristics of young-old patients and old-old patients were compared. RESULTS: Of the 105 elderly patientsconfirmed withCOVID-19, 81.0% were young-old patients, and 19.0% were old-old patients; 54.3% of elderly patients were females. Overall, 69.5% of elderly patients had underlying diseases, and the most common comorbidities included hypertension (43.8%), diabetes (25.7%), and cardiac disease (16.2%). Of the elderly patients, 22.9% were severe and 10.5% were critical severe cases. On admission, the most frequent symptoms in elderly patients included fever (66.7%), cough (64.8%), and fatigue (33.3%). Lymphopenia (31.4%), increased D-dimer (38.1%), depressed albumin (36.2%), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (41.0%), and a high level of C-reactive protein (79.0%) were common among elderly patients with COVID-19. The median prothrombin time (PT) and the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) were longer in old-old patients than young-old patients (PT median 12.3 vs. 13.1 s, p = 0.007; APTT median 39.0 vs. 33.5 s, p = 0.045). Young-old patients showed fewer complications (14.1%) than old-old patients (40.0%; p = 0.0014) and fewer received invasive ventilator support (3.5 vs. 25.0%, p = 0.006). As of March 11, 2020, 85.7% of elderly patients had been discharged, 3 deaths had occurred, and 11.4% were still hospitalized. CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients usually have chronic medical illness and are likely to have a severe or critically severe condition. They could show atypical symptoms without fever or cough and multiple organ dysfunction. Old-old patients tend to have more complications than young-old patients during hospitalization. Careful nursing, observation, and systemic treatment are very important in elderly patients.","Guo, Ting; Shen, Qinxue; Guo, Wei; He, Wenlong; Li, Jinhua; Zhang, Yi; Wang, Yunnian; Zhou, Zhiguo; Deng, Dingding; Ouyang, Xiaoli; Xiang, Zhi; Jiang, Minyan; Liang, Minyong; Huang, Peng; Peng, Zaimei; Xiang, Xudong; Liu, Wenlong; Luo, Hong; Chen, Ping; Peng, Hong",Gerontology,,239

Developing high throughput diagnostics which does not involve handling of infectious material becomes imperative in the case of pandemics such as the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV2. METHODS: A protein microarray technology was used to detect the plurality of antibody response to four novel antigens namely S1 glycoprotein, Receptor binding domain (RBD), S2 glycoprotein and Nucleoprotein of the novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV2 using serum samples. A DBS card was additionally used to compare its performance with a venipuncture-based serum separator tube (SST) draw. RESULTS: The three main subclasses of antibodies IgM, IgA and IgG were analyzed to see the variations in immune responses in the affected population and compared to their microbial RT-PCR based NP swab results. The clinical sensitivity and specificity were determined to be 99.67% and 99.77%. In the matrix comparison study, which would enable patients to test without risk of transmitting the virus, DBS (Dried Blood Spot) matched with higher than 98% accuracy to a venipuncture-based SST collection. CONCLUSION: Multiplex testing enables higher sensitivity and specificity which is essential while establishing exposure on a population scale. This flexible platform along with a discrete collection methodology would be crucial and broadly useful to scale up testing in current and future pandemics. Minimum sample volume that can be collected using DBS cards can be processed in this multiplex pillar plate format enabling the capacity to provide the reliability of high throughput analyzers while having the ease of collection similar to rapid tests.","Krishnamurthy, Hari Krishnan; Jayaraman, Vasanth; Krishna, Karthik; Rajasekaran, Karenah E; Wang, Tianhao; Bei, Kang; Rajasekaran, John J; Yaskin, Inna; Rai, Alex J; Choung, Rok Seon; Murray, Joseph A",PLoS One,,239

However, in most such cases, the hardware of the robot has been considered immutable, modeled as part of the environment. In this study, we explore the problem of learning hardware and control parameters together in a unified RL framework. To achieve this, we propose to model aspects of the robot's hardware as a""mechanical policy"", analogous to and optimized jointly with its computational counterpart. We show that, by modeling such mechanical policies as auto-differentiable computational graphs, the ensuing optimization problem can be solved efficiently by gradient-based algorithms from the Policy Optimization family. We present two such design examples: a toy mass-spring problem, and a real-world problem of designing an underactuated hand. We compare our method against traditional co-optimization approaches, and also demonstrate its effectiveness by building a physical prototype based on the learned hardware parameters.","Chen, Tianjian; He, Zhanpeng; Ciocarlie, Matei",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.04460v1.pdf,239

224934,Successful containment of a COVID-19 outbreak in Bach Mai Hospital by prompt and decisive responses,2021,"BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Intelligent Things (IIoT) are promising technologies to prevent the concerningly rapid spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and to maximize safety during the pandemic. With the exponential increase in the number of COVID-19 patients, it is highly possible that physicians and health care workers will not be able to treat all cases. Thus, computer scientists can contribute to the fight against COVID-19 by introducing more intelligent solutions to achieve rapid control of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes the disease. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this review were to analyze the current literature, discuss the applicability of reported ideas for using AI to prevent and control COVID-19, and build a comprehensive view of how current systems may be useful in particular areas. This may be of great help to many health care administrators, computer scientists, and policy makers worldwide. METHODS: We conducted an electronic search of articles in the MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Embase, and Web of Knowledge databases to formulate a comprehensive review that summarizes different categories of the most recently reported AI-based approaches to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19. RESULTS: Our search identified the 10 most recent AI approaches that were suggested to provide the best solutions for maximizing safety and preventing the spread of COVID-19. These approaches included detection of suspected cases, large-scale screening, monitoring, interactions with experimental therapies, pneumonia screening, use of the IIoT for data and information gathering and integration, resource allocation, predictions, modeling and simulation, and robotics for medical quarantine. CONCLUSIONS: We found few or almost no studies regarding the use of AI to examine COVID-19 interactions with experimental therapies, the use of AI for resource allocation to COVID-19 patients, or the use of AI and the IIoT for COVID-19 data and information gathering/integration. Moreover, the adoption of other approaches, including use of AI for COVID-19 prediction, use of AI for COVID-19 modeling and simulation, and use of AI robotics for medical quarantine, should be further emphasized by researchers because these important approaches lack sufficient numbers of studies. Therefore, we recommend that computer scientists focus on these approaches, which are still not being adequately addressed.","Adly, Aya Sedky; Adly, Afnan Sedky; Adly, Mahmoud Sedky",J Med Internet Res,,239

METHODS: We used a model to manage the PWEs during the outbreak. Questionnaire survey and hospital data were used to explore whether PWEs under our management were affected by the virus. RESULTS: A total of 118 (78.7%) PWEs completed the survey. During the ""model period,"" 22.9% (27/118) of the respondents reported antiepileptic drug (AEDs) discontinuity, including six (22.2%) PWEs who failed to purchase AEDs. Of the patients, 40.7% (22/54) failed to attend ordinary clinic, which was higher than that during the ""period before model"" (7.9%, 5/63). The common causes were movement limits (77.3%) and appointment failure (54.5%). A shift from ordinary clinic toward remote consultation was observed. Of the PWEs, 15.7% (13/83) referred to online pharmacy. 87.5% (14/16) of emergencies related to epilepsy were timely treated. 48.3%of PWEs thought that the epidemic had an impact on accessing medical services. Hospital data indicated that a decline in ordinary clinic visit, inpatient, surgery, and emergency attendance was observed in January and February 2020 and an increase in March 2020, as the epidemic mitigated. By contrast, online clinic visit soared in February, when the outbreak hit hard. In addition, we found no cross-infection of COVID-19 in our hospital and respondents. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated a much-needed model to manage the PWEs during the outbreak. We believed that the core architecture of this model was suitable for the management of other chronic diseases.","Si, Yang; Sun, Lingqi; Sun, Hongbin; Niu, Yulong; Mo, Qianning",Epilepsy Behav,,239

227405,UK-Wide Surveillance of Neurological and Neuropsychiatric Complications of COVID-19: The First 153 Patients,2020,"Today, COVID-19 is spreading around the world. Information about its mechanism, prognostic factors, and management is minimal. COVID-19, as a human disease, has several identifying phases. Physicians of patients with COVID-19 may be interested in knowing whether opioid use disorder may affect their patients' course or prognosis. This information may be crucial when considering the opioid epidemic in the US and other parts of the world. Opioid use at high doses and over several months duration can mitigate the immune system's function, which may complicate the course of COVID-19 disease. Potential suppression of parts of the immune response may be important in prevention, clinical support, and therapeutic use of medications in various phases of the COVID-19. Specifically, opioid use disorders via an inhalation route may enhance the ""late hyper-inflammatory phase"" or result in end-organ damage. It is well established that opioids decrease ventilation as their effect on the medullary respiratory centers increases the risk of pneumonia. This increased risk has been associated with immune-suppressive opioids. The ultimate role of opioids in COVID-19 is not clear. This paper endorses the need for clinical studies to decipher the role and impact of chronic opioid use on viral diseases such as COVID-19.","Ataei, Mahshid; Shirazi, Farshad M; Lamarine, Roland J; Nakhaee, Samaneh; Mehrpour, Omid",Subst Abuse Treat Prev Policy,,239

As health care resources have been prioritised to cater for patients affected by COVID-19, routine health care services have remained suspended. In an effort to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus, the UK introduced a country-wide lockdown which came into effect on the 23rd March 2020. Since then, clinics offering laser and intense pulsed light services have remained closed for business. As the rate of COVID-19 infection slows, the UK government has issued guidance for lifting of the lockdown in a cautious and phased manner. With this in view and to facilitate safe resumption of laser and intense pulsed light services, the British Medical Laser Services has issued this guidance document, based on best available and current scientific evidence.","Madan, Vishal",Lasers Med Sci,,239

228572,Coming together in a time of distancing: Creating community messaging for emergency care during covid,2021,"Purpose: We aimed to critically review the available information on the potential contribution of excessive kallikrein-kinin systems (KKSs) activation to severe respiratory inflammation in SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the likely consequence of ACE inhibition in seriously affected patients. Methods: The literature related to the above topic was reviewed including papers that analysed the connections, actions, interactions, consequences and occasionally suggestions for rational interventions. Results/Conclusion: Severe broncho-alveolar inflammation seems to be caused, at least in part, by upregulation of the KKS that increases plasma and/or local tissue concentrations of bradykinin (BK) in patients with COVID-19 infection. Besides KKS activation, suppression of ACE activity results in decreased bradykinin degradation, and these changes in concert can lead to excessive BK B1 and B2 receptor (BKB1R/BKB2R) activation. Aminopeptidase P (APP), and carboxypeptidase N also degrade bradykinin, but their protein expression and activity are unclear in COVID-19 infection. On the other hand, ACE2 expression is upregulated in patients with COVID-19 infection, so ACE2 activity is unlikely to be decreased despite blockade of part of ACE2 by the virus for entry into the cells. ACE2 cleaves lys-des-arginine9BK and arg-des-arginine9BK, the active metabolites of bradykinin, which stimulate the BKB1R receptor. Stimulation of BKB1R/BKB2R can exacerbate the pulmonary inflammatory response by causing vascular leakage and edema, vasodilation, smooth muscle spasm and stimulation of pain afferent nerves. Despite all uncertainties, it seems rational to treat comorbid COVID patients with serious respiratory distress syndrome with ARBs instead of high-dose ACE inhibitor (ACEi) that will further decrease bradykinin degradation and enhance BKB1R/BKB2R activation, but ACEi may not be contraindicated in patients with mild pulmonary symptoms.","Székács, B; Várbíró, S; Debreczeni, L",Physiol. int,,239

230393,COVID-19 Outcomes in Underserved Populations: Reaping What One Sows,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Although type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been reported as a risk factor for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the effect of pharmacologic agents used to treat T2DM, such as metformin, on COVID-19 outcomes remains unclear. Metformin increases the expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2, a known receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Data from people with T2DM hospitalized for COVID-19 were used to test the hypothesis that metformin use is associated with improved survival in this population. METHODS: Retrospective analyses were performed on de-identified clinical data from a major hospital in Wuhan, China, that included patients with T2DM hospitalized for COVID-19 during the recent epidemic. One hundred and thirty-one patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and T2DM were used in this study. The primary outcome was mortality. Demographic, clinical characteristics, laboratory data, diabetes medications, and respiratory therapy data were also included in the analysis. RESULTS: Of these 131 patients, 37 used metformin with or without other antidiabetes medications. Among the 37 metformin-taking patients, 35 (94.6%) survived and 2 (5.4%) did not survive. The mortality rates in the metformin-taking group versus the non-metformin group were 5.4% (2/37) versus 22.3% (21/94). Using multivariate analysis, metformin was found to be an independent predictor of survival in this cohort (P = .02). CONCLUSION: This study reveals a significant association between metformin use and survival in people with T2DM diagnosed with COVID-19. These clinical data are consistent with potential benefits of the use of metformin for COVID-19 patients with T2DM.","Li, Jinghong; Wei, Qi; Li, Willis X; McCowen, Karen C; Xiong, Wei; Liu, Jiao; Jiang, Wenlijun; Marin, Traci; Thomas, Robert L; He, Ming; Gongol, Brendan; Hepokoski, Mark; Yuan, Jason X-J; Shyy, John Y-J; Xiong, Nian; Malhotra, Atul",Endocr Pract,,239
231168,Internship commencement during COVID-19: the impact of an extended induction model,2021,"Introduction: Tobacco use and other cardiovascular risk factors often accompany chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This study derived and validated the Summit Score to predict mortality in people with COPD and cardiovascular risks. Methods: SUMMIT trial subjects (N=16,485) ages 40-80 years with COPD were randomly assigned 50%/50% to derivation (N=8181) and internal validation (N=8304). Three external COPD validations from Intermountain Healthcare included outpatients with cardiovascular risks (N=9251), outpatients without cardiovascular risks (N=8551), and inpatients (N=26,170). Cox regression evaluated 40 predictors of all-cause mortality. SUMMIT treatments including combined fluticasone furoate (FF) 100µg/vilanterol 25µg (VI) were not included in the score. Results: Mortality predictors were FEV1, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, body mass index, age, smoking pack-years, prior COPD hospitalizations, myocardial infarction, heart failure, diabetes, anti-thrombotics, anti-arrhythmics, and xanthines. Combined in the Summit Score (derivation: c=0.668), quartile 4 vs 1 had HR=4.43 in SUMMIT validation (p<0.001, 95% CI=3.27, 6.01, c=0.662) and HR=8.15 in Intermountain cardiovascular risk COPD outpatients (p<0.001, 95% CI=5.86, 11.34, c=0.736), and strongly predicted mortality in the other Intermountain COPD populations. Among all SUMMIT subjects with scores 14-19, FF 100µg/VI 25µg vs placebo had HR=0.76 (p=0.0158, 95% CI=0.61, 0.95), but FF 100µg/VI 25µg was not different from placebo for scores <14 or >19. Conclusion: In this post hoc analysis of SUMMIT trial data, the Summit Score was derived and validated in multiple Intermountain COPD populations. The score was used to identify a subpopulation in which mortality risk was lower for FF 100µg/VI 25µg treatment. Trial Registration: The SUMMIT trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov as number NCT01313676.","Horne, Benjamin D; Hegewald, Matthew J; Crim, Courtney; Rea, Susan; Bair, Tami L; Blagev, Denitza P",Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis,,239

232195,Coincidence of COVID-19 Infection and Smell-Taste Perception Disorders,2020,"RATIONALE: Clinicians typically encourage family presence in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) as a way to improve both patient and family outcomes. To limit the spread of the disease, families were typically prohibited from visiting the ICU during the COVID-19 pandemic. Little is known about the approach clinicians should take when engaging with families in times when they cannot visit the hospital. METHODS: Surrogates of critically ill patients with COVID-19 who participated in a clinical trial at a single academic center were contacted after ICU discharge to participate in a follow up study dealing with their ICU experience. Upon enrollment in this post-ICU discharge study, the subject (surrogate of the ICU patient) completed the Critical Care Family Needs Inventory (CCFNI) questionnaire and participated in a semi-structured telephone interview. The CCFNI questionnaire includes 14 questions dealing with aspects of the ICU experience that are important to family members. The answers to each question range from 1 (almost all the time) to 4 (none of the time), with lower scores indicating a better experience. Telephone interviews were transcribed and coded using thematic content analysis. RESULTS: Of the 58 subjects enrolled from September 2020 to December 2020, 23 (40%) respective patients were deceased. Subjects of deceased patients had higher median CCFNI scores than subjects of surviving patients, reflecting greater dissatisfaction with the ICU experience (1.82 [1.45-2.00] vs 1.45 [1.27-1.72], respectively, p=0.009). Subjects recollected that they typically received at least one medical update from the patient's ICU team each day. While many subjects felt that telephone communication with the ICU team was adequate, some believed they were unable to fully understand the patient's condition. In addition, some subjects feared the patient was clinically worsening when they did not receive frequent updates, which had a negative impact on their experience. Nearly all subjects reported that visitor restrictions made the ICU experience more difficult. Some subjects believed that the medical decisions that were made and the care the patient received were negatively impacted by not having family present at the bedside. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, families of critically ill patients typically received medical updates by phone daily because they were unable to visit. These aspects of ICU care delivery had differential effects on the ICU experience of families, with more negative experiences among families of deceased patients. These data suggest that more individualized approach to family engagement is needed during times of visitor restrictions.","Tringali, J.

In 2019 and 2020, COVID-19 mitigation was the only issue the world raised questions about; for example, the KSA and the rest of the world are working diligently to meet COVID-19 mitigation targets. To assess policy supervision in terms of the ability to achieve COVID-19 targets, this survey examines the operators necessary to achieve the SDGs in regard to improving COVID-19 mitigation and increasing economic growth. In particular, we examine COVID-19 mitigation under the setting of an N-shaped environmental Kuznets curve (N-shaped EKC) in the KSA. To identify the COVID-19 shock in the KSA, the effects of oil price and oil rent on CO2 emissions are examined. The results of the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) and non-autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) bound testing approach indicate that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the inverted N-shaped EKC hypothesis is validated in the long term. Empirically, we find that oil price strengthens the relationship of level, quadratic and cubic of economic growth and environmental quality while oil rent weakens this relationship. Additionally, the long-term incidences of positive shocks on oil price in the presence of COVID-19 outbreak are not similar to the negative shock to CO2 emissions, implying the existence of asymmetric impacts on carbon dioxide emissions in long-term forms. Our research implies that an oil price shock could be judicious for macro guidance of the economy in the KSA. Our findings are helpful for policymakers and investors in terms of their settlement planning because they can be used to evaluate prospective courses of economic profitability under the COVID-19 shock.","Aljadani, Abdussalam; Toumi, Hassen; Toumi, Said; Hsini, Mosbah; Jallali, Basma",,,239

This study evaluated performance of the Alfred 60 system combined with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) technology for rapid identification of uropathogens. The Alfred 60 system was used to screen urine cultures, followed by identifying the microbial pathogen in positive cultures using MALDI-TOF MS. The Alfred 60 detected positive cultures by measuring the turbidity of urine samples, which were transferred automatically to vials containing liquid medium and incubated for 3.5 h at 35 °C in the Alfred 60 system. Vials that showed growth were removed and centrifuged. The pellet was subjected to MALDI-TOF MS identification. In parallel, positive urine samples were inoculated onto agar plates for identification by conventional culture. The time required to detect positive urine cultures with Alfred 60 and identify the uropathogens with MALDI-TOF MS ranged from 15 min to 3.5 h. Among 146 positive urine samples tested, conventional cultures showed three culture groups: group 1 included 101 samples with growth of a single type of microorganism; group 2 included 34 samples with 2 types of microorganisms; and group 3 included 11 samples with &#8805; 3 types of microorganisms. Direct identification by MALDI-TOF MS was concordant with 95% of the samples in group 1, 100% of the principal microorganism in group 2, but could not identify microorganisms in group 3.

234256,Social Determinants of Adherence to COVID-19 Risk Mitigation Measures Among Adults With Cardiovascular Disease,2021,"Background: Real-world evidence on the association between autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases, therapies related to these diseases, and COVID-19 outcomes are inconsistent. We aimed to investigate the potential association between autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases and COVID-19 early in the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We did an exposure-driven, propensity score-matched study using a South Korean nationwide cohort linked to general health examination records. We analysed all South Korean patients aged older than 20 years who underwent SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing between Jan 1 and May 30, 2020, and received general health examination results from the Korean National Health Insurance Service. We defined autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases (inflammatory arthritis and connective tissue diseases) based on the relevant ICD-10 codes, with at least two claims (outpatient or inpatient) within 1 year. The outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test, severe COVID-19 (requirement of oxygen therapy, intensive care unit admission, application of invasive ventilation, or death), and COVID-19-related death. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs were estimated after adjusting for the potential confounders. Findings: Between Jan 1 and May 30, 2020, 133 609 patients (70 050 [52·4%] female and 63 559 [47·6%] male) completed the general health examination and were tested for SARS-CoV-2; 4365 (3·3%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2, and 8297 (6·2%) were diagnosed with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases. After matching, patients with an autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic disease showed an increased likelihood of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (adjusted OR 1·19, 95% CI 1·03-1·40; p=0·026), severe COVID-19 outcomes (1·26, 1·02-1·59; p=0·041), and COVID-19-related death (1·69, 1·01-2·84; p=0·046). Similar results were observed in patients with connective tissue disease and inflammatory arthritis. Treatment with any dose of systemic corticosteroids or disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) were not associated with COVID-19-related outcomes, but those receiving high dose (&#8805;10 mg per day) of systemic corticosteroids had an increased likelihood of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adjusted OR 1·47, 95% CI 1·05-2·03; p=0·022), severe COVID-19 outcomes (1·76, 1·06-2·96; p=0·031), and COVID-19-related death (3·34, 1·23-8·90; p=0·017). Interpretation: Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases were associated with an increased likelihood of a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test, worse clinical outcomes of COVID-19, and COVID-19-related deaths in South Korea. A high dose of systemic corticosteroid, but not DMARDs, showed an adverse effect on SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related clinical outcomes.

234406,Relationship cultivation and public engagement via social media during the covid-19 pandemic in China,2021,"Abstract Wastewater monitoring for virus infections within communities can complement conventional clinical surveillance. Currently, most SARS-CoV-2 clinical testing is voluntary and inconsistently available, except for a few occupational and educational settings, and therefore likely underrepresents actual population prevalence. Randomized testing on a regular basis to estimate accurate population-level infection rates is prohibitively costly and is hampered by a range of limitations and barriers associated with participation in clinical research. In comparison, community-level fecal monitoring can be performed through wastewater surveillance to effectively surveil communities. However, epidemiologically-defined protocols for wastewater sample site selection are lacking. Herein, we describe methods for developing a geographically-resolved population-level wastewater sampling approach in Jefferson County, Kentucky, and present preliminary results. Utilizing this site selection protocol, samples (n = 237) were collected from 17 wastewater catchment areas, September 8 to October 30, 2020 from one to four times per week in each area and compared to concurrent clinical data aggregated to wastewater catchment areas and county level. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was consistently present in wastewater during the studied period, and varied by area. Data obtained using the site selection protocol showed variation in geographically-resolved wastewater SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration compared to clinical rates. These findings highlight the importance of neighborhood-equivalent spatial scales and provide a promising approach for viral epidemic surveillance, thus better guiding spatially-targeted public health mitigation strategies.","Yeager, R.; Holm, R.

Since December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 spread swiftly around world and infected more than 25 million people and caused more than 800,000 deaths in 188 countries. Chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma and COPD appear to be a risk factor for COVID-19; however, their prevalence remains controversial. In fact, studies in China reported lower rates of chronic respiratory conditions in patients with COVID-19 than in the general population, while the trend is reversed in the United States and Europe. Although the underlying molecular mechanisms of a possible interaction between COVID-19 and chronic respiratory diseases remain unknown, some observations can help to resolve them. Indeed, physiological changes, immune response, or medication used against SARS-CoV-2 may have greater impact on patients with chronic respiratory conditions, already debilitated by chronic inflammation, dyspnea, and the use of immunosuppressant drugs like corticosteroids. In this review, we discuss the importance and the impact of COVID-19 on asthmatics and COPD patients, the possible available treatments, and patient management during the pandemic.","Bouazza, Belaid; Hadj-Said, Dihia; Pescatore, Karen A; Chahed, Rachid",,,239

METHODS: A retrospective observational study was carried out of patients consecutively admitted to Doctor Peset University Hospital, Valencia (Spain) for COVID-19 from 11 March to 28 April 2020. Every case was diagnosed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction or by serology test to detect antibodies. Demographic details, clinical characteristics, laboratory findings on admission and complications of each case were collected from electronic medical records. RESULTS: The dataset comprised 340 patients. Of them, 152 (44.6%) were aged >70 years. Comorbidities were more common in the older groups. Confusion was more common in older adults, whereas typical symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever, cough and myalgia, were less common. Oxygen saturation &#8804;93% on room air, neutrophilia, D-dimer >0.5 µg/mL, creatinine >1.5 mg/dL, lactate dehydrogenase &#8805;250 U/L and elevation of creatine kinase were higher in the older adult groups. Complications during hospitalization, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (53.3% vs 33.2%, P < 0.001), acute kidney injury (11.8% vs 5.3%; P = 0.030) and mortality (28.9% vs 6.5%; P < 0.001) were more common in patients aged >70 years. Oxygen saturation &#8804;93% on room air on admission was a predictor of mortality (odds ratio 11.65, 95% confidence interval 3.26-41.66, P < 0.001) in patients aged >70 years.

This caused many aesthetic practices around the country to close temporarily and led to a unique time period to evaluate the impact neurotoxin has in the setting of an ongoing pandemic. OBJECTIVES: To examine whether the administration of onabotulinumtoxinA (BOTOX Cosmetic, Allergan plc, Coolock, Ireland), in regular users, synergistically amplifies the elevation in mood/happiness, self-satisfaction with appearance and overall satisfaction, in the context of the ongoing pandemic. METHODS: A randomized single-blind cross-over study was designed to evaluate the impact of neurotoxin treatment in the upper third of the face on mood, self-satisfaction with appearance, and overall satisfaction. The placebo group crossed over to treatment after 1 month. Surveys evaluating patient happiness, self-satisfaction with appearance and overall efficacy were completed among both groups, and again to the placebo group again following crossover to treatment. RESULTS: Forty-five subjects were enrolled with 30 in the treatment and 15 in the control/cross-over group. The placebo group demonstrated no change in happiness or self-satisfaction in appearance until cross-over to the treatment group. Both groups, once receiving, onabotulinumtoxinA reported increased happiness, self-satisfaction with appearance and overall treatment satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: OnabotulinumtoxinA treatment to the upper face in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic was found to increase patient happiness, self-satisfaction with appearance, and overall treatment satisfaction.","Cristel, Robert T; Gandhi, Nimit D; Issa, Tariq Z; Kola, Eljona; Demesh, Daniel; Dayan, Steven H",Aesthet. surg. j,,239
237251,Testing the parasite-stress theory of sociality based on the circular model of human values: A multilevel analysis approach,,"PURPOSE: Reporting efficiency is commonly used to measure performance and quality in diagnostic imaging. For academic centers, balancing the clinical demand for efficient reporting and educational obligation to trainees remains a major challenge. The objective of this study was to quantify the effect of trainee education on reporting efficiency over the academic year (July to June) for a single diagnostic imaging examination type. METHODS: The authors reviewed a 10-year data set of lumbar spinal MRI reports and time-stamp data and compared change in mean reporting time for trainee versus attending radiologist-only reports. Odds ratios, linear regression, and correlation analysis were performed to evaluate relationships of mean and cumulative reporting times, volume, and study month. RESULTS: Mean reporting time for the trainee group peaked in July (287.2 ± 4.9 min). The largest month-to-month increase was from June to July (+46.3 min, P < .01) for the trainees, and July showed the largest deviation from annualized mean reporting time (odds ratio, 1.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-1.47; P < .001). Mean reporting time improved linearly over the course of the academic year from July to June for trainees (R2 = 0.59, P = .002), but this effect was absent in the attending radiologist-only group (P = .52). CONCLUSIONS: This study quantifies the effect of trainee education on reporting efficiency and models the operational ""learning curve"" of improved performance over the academic year. These data may inform staffing and workflow improvement efforts in academic radiology departments.","Caton, M Travis; Wiggins, Walter F; Pomerantz, Stuart R; Andriole, Katherine P",J. Am. Coll.

Here, we performed a comprehensive analysis of peripheral blood lymphocyte subpopulations in 82 patients with COVID-19, including 31 patients with a critical course of the disease. In COVID-19 patients who required hospitalization we analyzed T cell subsets, including Treg cells, as well as TCR&#945;/ß and Î³/Î´, NK cells, and B cells, during the first two weeks after admission to hospital due to the SARS-CoV-2 infection, with marked reductions in leukocytes subpopulations, especially in critically ill COVID-19 patients. We showed decreased levels of Th, Ts cells, Treg cells (both naïve and induced), TCR&#945;/ß and Î³/Î´ cells, as well as CD16+CD56+NK cells in ICU compared to non-ICU COVID-19 patients. We observed impaired function of T and NK cells in critically ill COVID-19 patients with extremely low levels of secreted cytokines. We found that the IL-2/INFÎ³ ratio was the strongest indicator of a critical course of COVID-19, and was associated with fatal outcomes. Our findings showed markedly impaired innate and adaptive responses in critically ill COVID-19 patients, and suggest that the immunosuppressive state in the case of a critical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection might reflect subsequent clinical deterioration and predict a fatal outcome.","Kalicinska, Elzbieta; Szymczak, Donata; Zinczuk, Aleksander; Adamik, Barbara; Smiechowicz, Jakub; Skalec, Tomasz; Nowicka-Suszko, Danuta; Biernat, Monika; Bogucka-Fedorczuk, Aleksandra; Rybka, Justyna; Martuszewski, Adrian; Gozdzik, Waldemar; Simon, Krzysztof; Wróbel, Tomasz",,,239
238286,Seroprevalence of COVID-19 infection in a rural district of South India: A population-based seroepidemiological study,2021,"BackgroundIn England, the rapid spread of the SARS-Cov-2 Alpha (B.1.1.7) variant from November 2020 led to national lockdown, including school closures in January 2021. We assessed SARS-CoV-2 infection, seroprevalence and seroconversion in students and staff when secondary schools reopened in March 2021. MethodsPublic Health England initiated SARS-CoV-2 surveillance in 18 secondary schools across six regions in September 2020. Participants provided nasal swabs for RT-PCR and blood samples for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at the beginning (September 2020) and end (December 2020) of the autumn term and at the start of the spring term (March 2021). FindingsIn March 2021, 1895 participants (1100 students, 795 staff) were tested; 5.6% (61/1094) students and 4.4% (35/792) staff had laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between December 2020 and March 2021. Nucleoprotein antibody seroprevalence was 36.3% (370/1018) in students and 31.9% (245/769) in staff, while spike protein antibody prevalence was 39.5% (402/1018) and 59.8% (459/769), respectively, similar to regional community seroprevalence. Between December 2020 and March 2021 (median 15.9 weeks), 14.8% (97/656; 95% CI: 12.2-17.7) students and 10.0% (59/590; 95% CI: 7.7-12.7) staff seroconverted. Weekly seroconversion rates were similar from September to December 2020 (8.0/1000) and from December 2020 to March 2021 (7.9/1000; students: 9.3/1,000; staff: 6.3/1,000). InterpretationBy March 2021, a third of secondary school students and staff had serological evidence of prior infection based on N-antibody seropositivity, and an additional third of staff had evidence of vaccine-induced immunity based on S-antibody seropositivity. Further studies are needed to assess the impact of the Delta variant. Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence Before this studyC_ST_ABSThe Alpha variant is 30-70% more transmissible than previously circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains in adults and children. One outbreak investigation in childcare settings estimated similar secondary attack rates with the Alpha variant in children and adults. There are limited data on the impact of the Alpha variant in educational settings. In England, cases in primary and secondary school aged children increased rapidly from late November 2020 and peaked at the end of December 2020, leading to national lockdown including school closures. Added Value of This StudySeroconversion rates in staff and students during December 2020 to March 2021, when the Alpha variant was the primary circulating strain in England, were similar to the period between September 2020 and December 2020 when schools were fully open for in-person teaching. By March 2021, a third of students overall and more than half the students in some regions were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Among staff, too, around a third had evidence of prior infection on serological testing and a further third had vaccine-induced immunity. Implications of all the Available EvidenceSARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence was high among secondary school students in March 2021 and is likely to be higher following the emergence of an even more transmissible Delta variant in May 2021. Education staff are increasingly being protected by the national COVID-19 immunisation programme. These findings have important implications for countries that are considering vaccination of children to control the pandemic","Ladhani, Shamez N; Ireland, Georgina; Baawuah, Frances; Beckmann, Joanne; Okike, Ifeanyichukwu O; Ahmad, Shazaad; Garstang, Joanna; Brent, Andrew J; Brent, Bernadette; Aiano, Felicity; Amin-Chowdhury, Zahin; Kall, Meaghan; Borrow, Ray; Linley, Ezra; Zambon, Maria; Poh, John; Warrener, Lenesha; Lackenby, Angie; Ellis, Joanna; Amirthalingam, Gayatri; Brown, Kevin E; Ramsay, Mary E",,,239
238288,Seroprevalence of COVID-19 infection in a rural district of South India: A population-based seroepidemiological study,2021,"Federated learning (FL) has emerged with increasing popularity to collaborate distributed medical institutions for training deep networks. However, despite existing FL algorithms only allow the supervised training setting, most hospitals in realistic usually cannot afford the intricate data labeling due to absence of budget or expertise. This paper studies a practical yet challenging FL problem, named \textit{Federated Semi-supervised Learning} (FSSL), which aims to learn a federated model by jointly utilizing the data from both labeled and unlabeled clients (i.e., hospitals). We present a novel approach for this problem, which improves over traditional consistency regularization mechanism with a new inter-client relation matching scheme. The proposed learning scheme explicitly connects the learning across labeled and unlabeled clients by aligning their extracted disease relationships, thereby mitigating the deficiency of task knowledge at unlabeled clients and promoting discriminative information from unlabeled samples. We validate our method on two large-scale medical image classification datasets. The effectiveness of our method has been demonstrated with the clear improvements over state-of-the-arts as well as the thorough ablation analysis on both tasks\footnote{Code will be made available at \url{https://github.com/liuquande/FedIRM}}.","Liu, Quande; Yang, Hongzheng; Dou, Qi; Heng, Pheng-Ann",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.08600v1.pdf,239

The aim of this study was the characterization of COVID-19 cases detected during this period. METHODS: We analyzed certain variables of interest coming from the epidemiological surveys carried out in an area of Madrid during May 2020, and stratified the results depending on its temporal relation with the deescalation. Prevalence for each category of response and average duration in minutes of the telephonic call were calculated. Confidence intervals were estimated at 95%. RESULTS: We included 167 cases, being 30.5% of them incident and 49.1% prevalent. The main source of infection was home (38.0%;CI 95% 31.4-46.2). Regarding healthcare and social care workers, the main source of infection was workplace (93.0%;85.4-100). Average number of close contacts per case was 2.0 (1.8-2.2), being 1.5 (1.0-2.0) among pre-deescalation incident cases and 2.4 (1.8-3.0) among those post-deescalation. Average duration of each survey was 35.9 minutes (32.2-38.9), being 32.1 (24.4-39.8) among pre-deescalation incident cases and 37.0 (29.6-44.4) among those post-deescalation. Most of the contacts were household, both before and after beginning of deescalation. CONCLUSIONS: Home is the most prevalent place for the acquisition of the infection among general population, while workplace is the most prevalent among healthcare and social care workers. The initial phase of deescalation do not represents a change regarding sources of infection, but it may increase the number of close contacts.","Pérez Romero, C.; Serrano Pareja, M.; Rumayor Zarzuelo, M.; Mata Pariente, N.; Hernando García, M.",Rev Esp Salud Publica,,239

243352,Poor Metabolic Health Increases COVID-19-Related Mortality in the UK Biobank Sample,2021,"We present a machine learning based COVID-19 cough classifier which can discriminate COVID-19 positive coughs from both COVID-19 negative and healthy coughs recorded on a smartphone. This type of screening is non-contact, easy to apply, and can reduce the workload in testing centres as well as limit transmission by recommending early self-isolation to those who have a cough suggestive of COVID-19. The datasets used in this study include subjects from all six continents and contain both forced and natural coughs, indicating that the approach is widely applicable. The publicly available Coswara dataset contains 92 COVID-19 positive and 1079 healthy subjects, while the second smaller dataset was collected mostly in South Africa and contains 18 COVID-19 positive and 26 COVID-19 negative subjects who have undergone a SARS-CoV laboratory test. Both datasets indicate that COVID-19 positive coughs are 15%-20% shorter than non-COVID coughs. Dataset skew was addressed by applying the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). A leave-p-out cross-validation scheme was used to train and evaluate seven machine learning classifiers: logistic regression (LR), k-nearest neighbour (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), multilayer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM) and a residual-based neural network architecture (Resnet50). Our results show that although all classifiers were able to identify COVID-19 coughs, the best performance was exhibited by the Resnet50 classifier, which was best able to discriminate between the COVID-19 positive and the healthy coughs with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.98. An LSTM classifier was best able to discriminate between the COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative coughs, with an AUC of 0.94 after selecting the best 13 features from a sequential forward selection (SFS). Since this type of cough audio classification is cost-effective and easy to deploy, it is potentially a useful and viable means of non-contact COVID-19 screening.","Pahar, Madhurananda; Klopper, Marisa; Warren, Robin; Niesler, Thomas",Comput Biol Med,,239

The objective of the study is to design and validate the Scale of Worry for Contagion of COVID-19 (PRE-COVID-19). METHOD: The study had a descriptive cross-sectional design. The population were young people and adults who resided in the cities of Lima and Callao (Perú) during the declaration of the national health emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic, during the period from March 16 to 27, 2020, who were recruited through a non-probability sample. The PRE-COVID-19, the WHO-Five Well-Being Index, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-2 and a single item were applied to measure the general perception of health. The scales were shared using a Google form through social networks. An internal consistency reliability analysis and structural equation models were performed, specifically confirmatory factor analysis. The recommendations of the Declaration of Helsinki and the principles that guide the ethical practice of online studies were followed. RESULTS: Eight hundred and sixteen young people and adults from Lima and Callao (200 men and 616 women; mean age 28.40, SD 7.10) participated. The results show a one-dimensional model with satisfactory goodness-of-fit indices: &#967;2 (9)=52.00; CFI=0.99; RMSEA=0.09 [0.07, 0.12]; WRMR=0.85. The &#955; of the model were higher than 0.50 and the reliability had an excellent value (&#969;=0.90). Likewise, the convergent and discriminant validity is evident between PRE-COVID-19 and measures of anxiety, well-being and self-reported health. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that the PRE-COVID-19 is a valid and reliable instrument to measure concern about the spread of COVID-19 and the emotional impact on people.","Caycho-Rodríguez, Tomás; Ventura-León, José; Barboza-Palomino, Miguel",Enferm. clin.

A scoping review,2020,"BACKGROUND: Universal screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection on Labor and Delivery (L&D) units is a critical strategy to manage patient and health worker safety, especially in a vulnerable high-prevalence community. We describe the results of a SARS-CoV-2 universal screening program at the L&D Unit at Elmhurst Hospital in Queens, NY, a 545-bed public hospital serving a diverse, largely immigrant and low-income patient population and an epicenter of the global pandemic. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study. All pregnant women admitted to the L&D Unit of Elmhurst Hospital from March 29, 2020 to April 22, 2020 were included for analysis. The primary outcomes of the study were: (1) SARS-CoV-2 positivity among universally screened pregnant women, stratified by demographic characteristics, maternal comorbidities, and delivery outcomes; and (2) Symptomatic or asymptomatic presentation at the time of testing among SARS-CoV-2 positive women. A total of 126 obstetric patients were screened for SARS-CoV-2 between March 29 and April 22. Of these, 37% were positive. Of the women who tested positive, 72% were asymptomatic at the time of testing. Patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were more likely to be of Hispanic ethnicity (unadjusted difference 24.4 percentage points, CI 7.9, 41.0) and report their primary language as Spanish (unadjusted difference 32.9 percentage points, CI 15.8, 49.9) than patients who tested negative. CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective cross-sectional study of data from a universal SARS-Cov-2 screening program implemented in the L&D unit of a safety-net hospital in Queens, New York, we found over one-third of pregnant women testing positive, the majority of those asymptomatic. The rationale for universal screening at the L&D Unit at Elmhurst Hospital was to ensure safety of patients and staff during an acute surge in SARS-Cov-2 infections through appropriate identification and isolation of pregnant women with positive test results. Women were roomed by their SARS-CoV-2 status given increasing space limitations. In addition, postpartum counseling was tailored to infection status. We quickly established discharge counseling and follow-up protocols tailored to their specific social needs. The experience at Elmhurst Hospital is instructive for other L&D units serving vulnerable populations and for pandemic preparedness.","Maru, Sheela; Patil, Uday; Carroll-Bennett, Rachel; Baum, Aaron; Bohn-Hemmerdinger, Tracy; Ditchik, Andrew; Scanlon, Michael L; Krishnan, Parvathy; Bogaert, Kelly; Woodbury, Carson; Maru, Duncan; Noble, Lawrence; Wasserman, Randi; Brown, Barry; Vreeman, Rachel; Masci, Joseph",PLoS One,,239

250456,A Low-cost Solution for Retrofitment of HEPA Filter in Healthcare Facilities Providing Care to COVID-19 Patients,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the processes and outcomes of 2021 colon and rectal surgery match season: one of the first National Resident Matching Program (NRMP) match to conduct uniformly virtual interviews for all programs and candidates due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Since this if the first-year interviews were held entirely virtual for a (NRMP) match season, we sought to determine: (1) How did program directors (PDs) in this year's fellowship conduct their virtual interviews? (2) Were any of these conduct decisions associated with the PD satisfaction with the resulting match? (3) What is the PDs opinion of how interviews should occur next year if COVID-19 is not a factor? DESIGN AND SETTING: The authors sent an anonymous survey to the PDs of all programs participating in the 2021 colon and rectal surgery residency match directly following match day 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-one colon and rectal residency PDs (70% response rate) responded to the survey (78% Male) representing a range of experience (Mâ¯=â¯7.61, SDâ¯=â¯5.66, years as PD at current institution), and program type (77.5% Academic, 7.5% Independent Academic Medical Center, 15% Nonacademic). RESULTS: While programs utilized several different platforms, conducted various forms of training for their faculty, and provided applicants with different types of information, interview day(s) across the specialty are reported to have proceeded smoothly. PDs as a whole were very satisfied with their match results this year (Mâ¯=â¯4.65, SDâ¯=â¯.66), and this satisfaction was not impacted by virtual interview decisions or processes. However, only 55% of PDs agree or strongly agree that next year's interviews should be virtual regardless of COVID-19, a judgement solely influenced by the opinion of other program faculty on virtual interviews, regardless of satisfaction with match or comfort with technology. CONCLUSION: While PDs report high satisfaction with virtual interview processes and outcomes, there is less agreement that colon and rectal surgery residency interviews should move to a solely virtual platform.","D039,; Angelo, Jonathan D; Angelo, Anne-Lise D; Mathis, Kellie L; Dozois, Eric J; Kelley, Scott R",J. surg. educ,,239

Given the importance to assess the evolution and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 and to forecast the next scenario of the pandemic, mainly in countries with limited healthcare systems, we estimated the reproductive number (R0) of SARS-CoV-2 in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), India, and a possible scenario for this pandemic in the region. Subject and methods: We estimated the reproductive number (R0) of SARS-CoV-2 in its first outbreak stage in the northwestern region of Himalaya, India, and we also predicted new daily cases for the next 90 days using different R0, testing a plausible end of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Results: Our results showed a considerable increase in the number of cases, but with a tendency to asymptote. Anantnag, Bandipora, Baramulla, Shopian, and Srinagar districts showed more than 100 cases and Kulgam and Kathua districts showed strong growth of the number of cases from the beginning of May, without a tendency to normalization. The estimated R0 for the J&K region was 1.041; but by decreasing the RO by 10, 25, and 50%, we observed a great decrease in the daily number of new cases, especially by decreasing by 50%. Conclusion: In this study, we indicate positive effects of the preventive measures, such as lockdown and social distancing, taken in the J&K region, showing a stabilization of the growth curves of new cases of SARS-CoV-2, which tends to a strong decrease over time as the R0 decreases.","Haq, Shiekh Marifatul; Yaqoob, Umer; Hassan, Musheerul; da Silva, Rafaela José; Calixto, Eduardo Soares",Z Gesundh Wiss,,239

The use of prevascularized models built from dedicated materials could solve some of the actual limitations, such as suboptimal integration of the bioconstructs within the host tissue, and would provide more in vivo-like perfusable tissue and organ-specific platforms. In the last decade, the fabrication of vascularized physiologically relevant 3D constructs has been attempted by numerous tissue engineering strategies, which are classified here in microfluidic technology, 3D coculture models, namely, spheroids and organoids, and biofabrication. In this review, the recent advancements in prevascularization techniques and the increasing use of natural and synthetic materials to build physiological organ-specific models are discussed. Current drawbacks of each technology, future perspectives, and translation of vascularized tissue constructs toward clinics, pharmaceutical field, and industry are also presented. By combining complementary strategies, these models are envisioned to be successfully used for regenerative medicine and drug development in a near future.","Dellaquila, Alessandra; Le Bao, Chau; Letourneur, Didier; Simon-Yarza, Teresa",Adv Sci (Weinh),,239

The unprecedented circumstances created by the COVID-19 public health crisis further strained the placement process, revealing a delicate balance of interdependent systems that schools must address when confronted with an unforeseen disruption of field education. This paper reflectively examines the steps taken by the field faculty and department of one large school of social work to address the impact of the pandemic on field education and its placement process. Utilizing crisis and shared trauma perspectives, the field disruptions, continuity of learning, contingency plans, and the attendant anxiety caused by COVID-19 are discussed, as are the lessons learned. Though COVID-19 has significantly altered the placement process, this reflective frame allows faculty to take the lessons emerging from the crisis and use them to improve services and learning opportunities for students in the future.","Dempsey, Anne; Lanzieri, Nicholas; Luce, Virge; de Leon, Cora; Malhotra, Juhi; Heckman, Aminda",Clin Soc Work J,,239
255653,COVID-19 infection in Italy: An occupational injury,2020,"During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, many emergency departments (EDs) initiated continuous use of N95 disposable respirators (N95s) rather than discarding them after each use to conserve respirators. This study investigates the efficacy of wearing disposable N95s continuously during clinical work. METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study of ED staff required to wear N95s continuously throughout their shifts. Subjects were doctors, nurses, and technicians who were previously fitted for their assigned N95 by employee health. Subjects were fit tested periodically throughout their shifts. Investigators filled out a questionnaire for each subject noting the hours of continuous N95 wear. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: One hundred thirteen N95s were evaluated, with 23 failures at first testing. These were not retested. Twenty-seven N95s passed at the start of a shift and did not have repeat testing during the course of the shift. These were excluded from further analysis. Seventeen N95s passed testing after several hours of continuous wear, but only had a single fit test done partway or at the end of a shift. These were assumed to have passed if tested at shift start, and were assigned as ""passes"" for continuous use. Forty-six N95s had an initial pass and were evaluated for continuous use, of which 6 subsequently failed later in the shift, giving a fail rate with continuous use of 9.5%. CONCLUSION: Continuous use of disposable N95s throughout an ED shift is reasonable during a PPE shortage if wearers are assured of fit at the start of their shift.","Rivard, Leah; Pester, Jonathan; McMahon, Kathleen; Check, Ronald; Kelly, Brian; Balakrishnan, Vamsi; Jeanmonod, Donald; Jeanmonod, Rebecca",Am J Emerg Med,,239

257227,COVID-19 in the MENA Region: Facts and Findings,2021,"A coronavirus pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has spread rapidly worldwide since December 2019. Improved understanding and new strategies to cope with novel coronaviruses are urgently needed. Viruses (especially RNA viruses) encode a limited number and size (length of polypeptide chain) of viral proteins and must interact with the host cell components to control (hijack) the host cell machinery. To achieve this goal, the extensive mimicry of SLiMs in host proteins provides an effective strategy. However, little is known regarding SLiMs in coronavirus proteins and their potential targets in host cells. The objective of this study is to uncover SLiMs in coronavirus proteins that are present within host cells. These SLiMs have a high possibility of interacting with host intracellular proteins and hijacking the host cell machinery for virus replication and dissemination. In total, 1,479 SLiM hits were identified in the 16 proteins of 590 coronaviruses infecting humans. Overall, 106 host proteins were identified that may interact with SLiMs in 16 coronavirus proteins. These SLiM-interacting proteins are composed of many intracellular key regulators, such as receptors, transcription factors and kinases, and may have important contributions to virus replication, immune evasion and viral pathogenesis. A total of 209 pathways containing proteins that may interact with SLiMs in coronavirus proteins were identified. This study uncovers potential mechanisms by which coronaviruses hijack the host cell machinery. These results provide potential therapeutic targets for viral infections.","Yang, Chu-Wen; Shi, Zhi-Ling",PLoS One,,239

Independent head-to-head studies are necessary for SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDT nasal sampling to demonstrate comparability of performance with nasopharyngeal (NP) sampling. We conducted a head-to-head comparison study of a supervised, self-collected nasal mid-turbinate (NMT) swab and a professional-collected NP swab, using the Panbio&#8482; Ag-RDT (distributed by Abbott). We calculated positive and negative percent agreement between the sampling methods as well as sensitivity and specificity for both sampling techniques compared to the reference standard reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). A SARS-CoV-2 infection could be diagnosed by RT-PCR in 45 of 290 participants (15.5%). Comparing the NMT and NP sampling the positive percent agreement of the Ag-RDT was 88.1% (37/42 PCR positives detected; CI 75.0-94.8%). The negative percent agreement was 98.8% (245/248; CI 96.5-99.6%). The overall sensitivity of Panbio with NMT sampling was 84.4% (38/45; CI 71.2-92.3%) and 88.9% (40/45; CI 76.5-95.5%) with NP sampling. Specificity was 99.2% (243/245; CI 97.1-99.8%) for both, NP and NMT sampling. The sensitivity of the Panbio test in participants with high viral load (> 7 log10 SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies/mL) was 96.3% (CI 81.7-99.8%) for both, NMT and NP sampling. For the Panbio supervised NMT self-sampling yields comparable results to NP sampling.

METHODS: Public Health England conducts invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and SARS-CoV-2 surveillance in England. IPD trends during 2000/01-2019/20 were analysed and cases between during February-June 2020 were linked with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess risk factors for death. RESULTS: IPD incidence in 2019/20 (7.6/100,000; n=3,964) was 30% (IRR 0.70, 95%CI, 0.18-2.67) lower compared to 2018/19 (10.9/100,000; n=5,666) with large reductions observed across all age-groups during March-June 2020. The serotypes responsible for IPD during 2019/20 were similar to previous years. There were 160,886 SARS-CoV-2 and 1,137 IPD cases during February-June 2020, including 40 IPD/COVID-19 (0.025% [95%sCI, 0.018-0.034] of SARS-CoV-2 infections; 3.5% [95%CI, 2.5-4.8] of IPD cases), 21 with COVID-19 diagnosed 3-27 days after IPD and 27 who developed COVID-19 &#8805;28 days after IPD. Case-fatality rates (CFR) were 63.2% (25/40), 47.6% (10/21) and 33.3% (9/27), respectively (p<0.001). In addition to an independent association with increasing age and pneumococcal serotype group, CFR was 7.8-fold (95% CI, 3.8-15.8) higher in those with IPD/COVID-19 co-infection and 3.9-fold (95% CI, 1.4-10.7) higher in patients who developed COVID-19 3-27 days after IPD compared to patients with IPD only. CONCLUSIONS: Large declines in IPD were observed following COVID-19 lockdown in England. IPD/COVID-19 confections were rare but associated with high CFR, mainly in older adults. The rarity, age distribution and serotype distribution of IPD/SARS-CoV-2 coinfections does not support wider extension of pneumococcal vaccination.","Amin-Chowdhury, Zahin; Aiano, Felicity; Mensah, Anna; Sheppard, Carmen; Litt, David; Fry, Norman K; Andrews, Nick; Ramsay, Mary E; Ladhani, Shamez N",Clin. infect. dis,,239

MethodsWe identified SARDs patients in a large healthcare system with COVID-19 vaccination [≥]14 days prior to a positive SARS-CoV-2 molecular test. Details of the patients SARD, vaccination status, and COVID-19 infection were extracted. ResultsOf 340 confirmed COVID-19 infections among SARDs patients between December 11th, 2020 (date of first COVID-19 vaccine approval in the US) and July 30th, 2021, we identified 16 breakthrough infections. Seven (44%) received the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine, five (31%) received the Moderna vaccine, and four (25%) received the Janssen/Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The most common SARDs included rheumatoid arthritis (6, 38%), inflammatory myopathy (3, 19%), and systemic lupus erythematosus (3, 19%). Rituximab (5, 31%), glucocorticoids (4, 25%), and mycophenolate mofetil (4, 25%) were the most frequent treatments. Among the breakthrough infections, 15 (93%) were symptomatic, six (38%) were hospitalized, one (6%) required mechanical ventilation, and two (13%) died. ConclusionsSymptomatic, including severe, breakthrough infections were observed in SARDs patients; many were on treatments associated with attenuated antibody responses to vaccination. Further studies are needed to determine the rate of breakthrough infection associated with SARD treatments and other features. Key messagesO_ST_ABSWhat is already known about this subject?C_ST_ABSBreakthrough infections following COVID-19 vaccination are expected but some patients with systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (SARDs) may be at higher risk because of blunted antibody responses to vaccination associated with rheumatic disease treatments and other factors that remain poorly understood. What does this study add?We identify and describe 16 COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough infections within the Mass General Brigham system between December 11th, 2020 and June 26th, 2021. The vast majority of cases were symptomatic and two were fatal. How might this impact on clinical practice or future developments?This study complements observations regarding the attenuated antibody response to COVID-19 vaccination in patients with SARDs by identifying serious clinical outcomes from breakthrough infections in patients receiving DMARDs that have been reported to have blunted vaccine responses. Our study identifies characteristics of COVID-19 breakthrough infections that may guide the prioritization of booster vaccines and other risk-mitigating strategies in patients with SARDs.","Cook, Claire; Patel, Naomi; D039, Kristin; Silva,; Hsu, Tiffany T-Y; DiIorio, Michael; Prisco, Lauren; Martin, Lily; Vanni, Kathleen M.M.; Zaccardelli, Alessandra; Todd, Derrick J.; Sparks, Jeffrey A; Wallace, Zachary S",,,239

260365,Preventing intra-hospital infection and transmission of COVID-19 in healthcare workers,2020,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a serious complication in critically ill patients with COVID-19 with a reported incidence ranging from <5% to >25%. Proposed aetiologies include hypovolemia, hemodynamic disturbance and inflammation but also specific factors like direct viral invasion, microvascular thrombosis, and altered regulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. To date, there are no confirmed specific therapies, and prevention and management of AKI should follow established guidelines. Novel therapies specifically targeting COVID-19 related pathologies are under investigation. The incidence of renal replacement therapy (RRT) is variable, ranging from 0-37%. In a pandemic, RRT practice is likely to be determined by the number of patients, availability of machines, consumables and staff, clinical expertise, and acceptable alternatives. Close collaboration between critical care and renal services is essential. In this article, we describe the epidemiology and pathophysiology of COVID-19 associated AKI, outline current management and suggest strategies to provide RRT during a pandemic when resources may be scarce.","Ostermann, Marlies; Lumlertgul, Nuttha; Forni, Lui G; Hoste, Eric",J Crit Care,,239

When facing the emerging infectious diseases, schools should play a full role of preventing and controlling school-based infectious diseases. Firstly, schools should use and propagandize Chinese laws, regulations and health systems about infectious diseases prevention and treatment including prevention and control of infectious diseases in schools. Secondly, schools should establish and unblock a long-term infectious disease prevention and control system. Thirdly, schools should attach importance to the establisment of a professional school doctor team(school health teacher). Fourthly, schools should provide school health education and collaborate with school health supervision professionals. The fort role of school health work in the prevention and control of NCP, especially after students return to school, should be fully embodied in order to with stand the challenge from new infectious diseases and guarantee safety and health of students and teachers.","ZHANG-Xin,",Chinese Journal of School Health,,239
260423,Long term complications and rehabilitation of COVID-19 patients,2020,"The rapid spread of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pathogen has generated a huge international public health emergency. Currently the reference diagnostic technique for virus determination is Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) real time analysis that requires specialized equipment, reagents and facilities and typically 3-4 h to perform. Thus, the realization of simple, low-cost, small-size, rapid and point-of-care diagnostics tests has become a global priority. In response to the current need for quick, highly sensitive and on-site detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in several aqueous solutions, a specific molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) receptor has been designed, realized, and combined with an optical sensor. More specifically, the proof of concept of a SARS-CoV-2 sensor has been demonstrated by exploiting a plasmonic plastic optical fiber sensor coupled with a novel kind of synthetic MIP nano-layer, especially designed for the specific recognition of Subunit 1 of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. First, we have tested the effectiveness of the developed MIP receptor to bind the Subunit 1 of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, then the results of preliminary tests on SARS-CoV-2 virions, performed on samples of nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs in universal transport medium (UTM) and physiological solution (0.9% NaCl), were compared with those obtained with RT-PCR. According to these preliminary results, the sensitivity of the proposed optical-chemical sensor proved to be higher than the RT-PCR one. Furthermore, a relatively fast response time (about 10 min) to the virus was obtained without the use of additional reagents.","Cennamo, Nunzio; D039,; Agostino, Girolamo; Perri, Chiara; Arcadio, Francesco; Chiaretti, Guido; Parisio, Eva Maria; Camarlinghi, Giulio; Vettori, Chiara; Di Marzo, Francesco; Cennamo, Rosario; Porto, Giovanni; Zeni, Luigi",Sensors (Basel),,239

261070,"Highlights From AES2020, a Virtual American Epilepsy Society Experience",2021,"Abstract During the covid-19 pandemic, physical distancing is being promoted to reduce the disease transmission and pressure on health systems. Yet, what determines physical distancing? Through a panel data analysis, this article identifies some of its determinants. Using a specifically built index that measures the strictness of physical distancing rules in the 27 Brazilian states, this paper isolates the effect of mandatory physical distancing rules from other potential determinants of physical distancing. The article concludes that physical distancing is influenced by at least three variables: the strictness of mandatory physical distancing rules, the number of confirmed cases of covid-19, and the duration of rules. Evidence also indicates that the effect of physical distancing measures is relatively stronger than that of the number of cases -physical distancing is determined proportionally more by mandatory policies than people's awareness about the severity of the epidemic. These results have at least two policy implications. First, governments should adopt mandatory measures in order to increase physical distancing - rather than expect people to adopt them on their own. Second, the timing of adopting them is important, since people are unlikely to comply with them for long periods of time.","Moraes, Rodrigo Fracalossi de",Ciênc. Saúde Colet,,239

We investigated two soluble markers of monocyte activation, sCD14 and sCD163, in COVID-19 patients, with the aim of characterizing their potential role in monocyte-macrophage disease immunopathology. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of its kind. Methods: Fifty-nine SARS-Cov-2 positive hospitalized patients, classified according to ICU or non-ICU admission requirement, were prospectively recruited and analyzed by ELISA for levels of sCD14 and sCD163, along with other laboratory parameters, and compared to a healthy control group. Results: sCD14 and sCD163 levels were significantly higher among COVID-19 patients, independently of ICU admission requirement, compared to the control group. We found a significant correlation between sCD14 levels and other inflammatory markers, particularly Interleukin-6, in the non-ICU patients group. sCD163 showed a moderate positive correlation with the time lapsed from admission to sampling, independently of severity group. Treatment with corticoids showed an interference with sCD14 levels, whereas hydroxychloroquine and tocilizumab did not. Conclusions: Monocyte-macrophage activation markers are increased and correlate with other inflammatory markers in SARS-Cov-2 infection, in association to hospital admission. These data suggest a preponderant role for monocyte-macrophage activation in the development of immunopathology of COVID-19 patients.","Gómez-Rial, Jose; Currás-Tuala, Maria José; Rivero-Calle, Irene; Gómez-Carballa, Alberto; Cebey-López, Miriam; Rodríguez-Tenreiro, Carmen; Dacosta-Urbieta, Ana; Rivero-Velasco, Carmen; Rodríguez-Núñez, Nuria; Trastoy-Pena, Rocio; Rodríguez-García, Javier; Salas, Antonio; Martinón-Torres, Federico",Front Immunol,,239

Objectives This study was conducted to assess the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and nationwide lockdown on systemic cancer care. Materials and Methods This comparative descriptive study was conducted in the Department of Medical Oncology and Haematology in a tertiary care center in India. The study compared and analyzed the consecutive patient data of two different units in the Department of Medical Oncology in the pre-COVID phase (PCP) and post lockdown relaxation phase (PLRP). We represented the categorical data in frequency and percentage, and chi-squared test was used to analyze the variables. Results Patients were categorized based on demographic, disease-related, and hospital visit-related parameters and a significant drop noted in patients who utilized a prebooking facility (p = 0.0001), in the number of patients aged &gt;50 years (p = 0.004), number of patients who presented with hematological malignancies (p = 0.006), and who came for follow-up (p = 0.0001). The other parameters remained statistically insignificant. Conclusions During PLRP, active systemic cancer care seems to have been less affected, whereas follow-up of patients and visits of elderly patients were significantly reduced. If the pandemic remains under control, cancer care may not get compromised. This shows the importance of flattening the curve for quality management of other diseases during a pandemic.","Pattiyeil, A.; Antony, F.; Cyriac, S. L.; Jose, A.; Jini, M.

Structural studies have led to the development of mutations that stabilize Betacoronavirus spike proteins in the prefusion state, improving their expression and increasing immunogenicity1. This principle has been applied to design mRNA-1273, an mRNA vaccine that encodes a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that is stabilized in the prefusion conformation. Here we show that mRNA-1273 induces potent neutralizing antibody responses to both wild-type (D614) and D614G mutant2 SARS-CoV-2 as well as CD8+ T cell responses, and protects against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lungs and noses of mice without evidence of immunopathology. mRNA-1273 is currently in a phase III trial to evaluate its efficacy.","Corbett, Kizzmekia S; Edwards, Darin K; Leist, Sarah R; Abiona, Olubukola M; Boyoglu-Barnum, Seyhan; Gillespie, Rebecca A; Himansu, Sunny; Schäfer, Alexandra; Ziwawo, Cynthia T; DiPiazza, Anthony T; Dinnon, Kenneth H; Elbashir, Sayda M; Shaw, Christine A; Woods, Angela; Fritch, Ethan J; Martinez, David R; Bock, Kevin W; Minai, Mahnaz; Nagata, Bianca M; Hutchinson, Geoffrey B; Wu, Kai; Henry, Carole; Bahl, Kapil; Garcia-Dominguez, Dario; Ma, LingZhi; Renzi, Isabella; Kong, Wing-Pui; Schmidt, Stephen D; Wang, Lingshu; Zhang, Yi; Phung, Emily; Chang, Lauren A; Loomis, Rebecca J; Altaras, Nedim Emil; Narayanan, Elisabeth; Metkar, Mihir; Presnyak, Vlad; Liu, Cuiping; Louder, Mark K; Shi, Wei; Leung, Kwanyee; Yang, Eun Sung; West, Ande; Gully, Kendra L; Stevens, Laura J; Wang, Nianshuang; Wrapp, Daniel; Doria-Rose, Nicole A; Stewart-Jones, Guillaume; Bennett, Hamilton",Nature,,239
263610,"Obesity and COVID-19 Severity in a Designated Hospital in Shenzhen, China",2020,"Nowadays, there is an increasing demand for more accessible routine diagnostics for patients with respect to high accuracy, ease of use, and low cost. However, the quantitative and high accuracy bioassays in large hospitals and laboratories usually require trained technicians and equipment that is both bulky and expensive. In addition, the multi-step bioassays and long turnaround time could severely affect the disease surveillance and control especially in pandemics such as influenza and COVID-19. In view of this, a portable, quantitative bioassay device will be valuable in regions with scarce medical resources and help relieve burden on local healthcare systems. Herein, we introduce the MagiCoil diagnostic device, an inexpensive, portable, quantitative and rapid bioassay platform based on magnetic particle spectrometer (MPS) technique. MPS detects the dynamic magnetic responses of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) and uses the harmonics from oscillating MNPs as metrics for sensitive and quantitative bioassays. This device does not require trained technicians to operate and employs a fully automatic, one-step, wash-free assay with user friendly smartphone interface. Using a streptavidin-biotin binding system as a model, we show that the detection limit of the current portable device for streptavidin is 64 nM (equal to 5.12 pmole). In addition, this MPS technique is very versatile and allows for the detection of different diseases just by changing the surface modifications on MNPs.","Wu, Kai; Chugh, Vinit Kumar; Girolamo, Arturo di; Liu, Jinming; Saha, Renata; Su, Diqing; Krishna, Venkatramana D.; Nair, Abilash; Davies, Will; Wang, Andrew Yongqiang; Cheeran, Maxim C-J; Wang, Jian-Ping",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.10211v1.pdf,239

METHODS: Nationally representative longitudinal panel data from the Understanding Society COVID-19 survey were analyzed. The analytical sample comprises 886 adolescents aged 10-16 years surveyed both before and during the pandemic. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire was used to measure adolescents' mental health. RESULTS: The results from person fixed-effects regression models show that adolescents with better-than-median mental health before the pandemic have experienced an increase in their emotional problems, conduct problems, hyperactivity, and peer relationship problems, but a decrease in their prosocial tendency during the pandemic. In contrast, adolescents with worse-than-median mental health before the pandemic have experienced opposite changes in each Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire domain. Further results from lagged dependent variable regression models show that compared with girls, boys have experienced a smaller increase in emotional problems but a greater decrease in prosocial tendency. The negative mental health impact is particularly prominent among adolescents in one-parent, one-child, and low-income households. Adult household members' COVID-19 symptoms and illness have undermined adolescents' peer relationships. CONCLUSIONS: The results reveal the pandemic's diverse impacts on adolescent mental health, which vary with adolescents' prepandemic mental health and sociodemographic backgrounds. The findings underline the need for tailored mental health support for adolescents and targeted measures to mitigate inequalities in the mental health impact of the pandemic.","Hu, Yang; Qian, Yue",J Adolesc Health,,239

266014,Management of gynecologic cancer: Choosing radiotherapy wisely by 3 Southern Ontario academic centers during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Newsfeed algorithms frequently amplify misinformation and other low-quality content. How can social media platforms more effectively promote reliable information? Existing approaches are difficult to scale and vulnerable to manipulation. In this paper, we propose using the political diversity of a website's audience as a quality signal. Using news source reliability ratings from domain experts and web browsing data from a diverse sample of 6,890 U.S. citizens, we first show that websites with more extreme and less politically diverse audiences have lower journalistic standards. We then incorporate audience diversity into a standard collaborative filtering framework and show that our improved algorithm increases the trustworthiness of websites suggested to users -- especially those who most frequently consume misinformation -- while keeping recommendations relevant. These findings suggest that partisan audience diversity is a valuable signal of higher journalistic standards that should be incorporated into algorithmic ranking decisions.","Bhadani, Saumya; Yamaya, Shun; Flammini, Alessandro; Menczer, Filippo; Ciampaglia, Giovanni Luca; Nyhan, Brendan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.08078v1.pdf,239

DESIGN: Using social media for recruitment, we partnered with a local community task force to administer a brief online survey. SETTING: Residential urban community. SAMPLE: Eighty-four community members, the majority of whom were white, female, college educated completed the survey. MEASURES: Theory of planned behavior constructs: behavioral intentions, attitudes, perceived norms, and perceived behavioral control for 3 social distancing behaviors: maintaining a 6-foot distance, avoiding places people congregate, and staying home as much as possible. ANALYSIS: Path analyses were conducted to understand significant determinants of intentions for each behavior to guide the development of locally tailored health promotion messages. RESULTS: The RCBD was implemented, and results were communicated to the community within 1 week. Intentions were high across the 3 behaviors but lowest for staying home as much as possible. Younger participants had lower intentions of maintaining a 6-foot distance than older participants. For each behavior, specific recommendations for health promotion messaging emerged based on how attitudes, norms, and perceived behavioral control related to intentions. CONCLUSION: In a situation where local community action is paramount for reducing coronavirus transmission, this RCBD process is feasible and useful for informing local health promotion.","Smith, Philip H; Branscum, Paul W",Am J Health Promot,,239

272258,The Association of TSH and Thyroid Hormones With Lymphopenia in Bacterial Sepsis and COVID-19,2021,"With the outbreak of the coronavirus, governments rely more and more on location data shared by European mobile network operators to monitor the advancements of the disease. In order to comply with often strict privacy requirements, this location data, however, has to be anonymized, limiting its usefulness for making statements about a filtered part of the population, like already infected people. In this research, we aim to assist with the disease tracking efforts by designing a protocol to detect coronavirus hotspots from mobile data while still maintaining compliance with privacy expectations. We use various state-of-the-art privacy-preserving cryptographic primitives to design a protocol that can best be described as aggregated private information retrieval (APIR). Our protocol is based on homomorphic encryption, with additional measures to protect against malicious requests from clients. We have implemented our APIR protocol in the SEAL library and tested it for parameters suitable to create a coronavirus hotspot map for entire nationstates. This demonstrates that it is feasible to apply our APIR protocol to support nationwide disease analysis while still preserve the privacy of infected people.","Helminger, Lukas; Kales, Daniel; Rechberger, Christian; Walch, Roman",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.02061v1.pdf,239

The efficacy and safety of sacubitril-valsartan in patients with HF are controversial. We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to assess and compare the effect and adverse events of sacubitril-valsartan, valsartan, and enalapril in patients with HF. METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a systematic search using PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Randomized controlled trials involving the use of sacubitril-valsartan in patients with HF were included. We assessed the pooled odds ratio (OR) of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and hospitalization for HF in fixed-effects models and the pooled risk ratio (RR) of symptomatic hypotension, worsening renal function, and hyperkalaemia in fixed-effects models. Of the 315 identified records, six studies involving 14 959 patients were eligible for inclusion. Sacubitril-valsartan reduced the endpoints of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) in three trials with pooled ORs of 0.83 (P = 0.0006) and 0.78 (P < 0.0001), respectively. Regarding the composite outcome of hospitalization for HF in five trials, the pooled OR was 0.79 (P < 0.00001). Compared with enalapril or valsartan, sacubitril-valsartan was associated with a high risk of symptomatic hypotension (RR 1.47, P < 0.00001), low risk of worsening renal function (RR 0.81, P = 0.005), and low rate of serious hyperkalaemia (&#8805;6.0 mmol/L) (RR 0.76, P = 0.0007) in all six trials. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, sacubitril-valsartan significantly decreased the risk of death from all causes or cardiovascular causes in HFrEF and hospitalization for HF in both patients with HFrEF and HF with preserved ejection fraction. Sacubitril-valsartan reduced the risk of renal dysfunction and serious hyperkalaemia but was associated with more symptomatic hypotension.","Zhang, Hongzhou; Huang, Tieqiu; Shen, Wen; Xu, Xiuxiu; Yang, Pingping; Zhu, Dan; Fang, Haiyang; Wan, Hongbing; Wu, Tao; Wu, Yanqing; Wu, Qinghua",ESC Heart Fail,,239
273591,The Recalibration of Interventional Cardiology During COVID-19: An Opportunity for a Future Paradigm,2021,"Bacillus thuringiensis is a Gram-positive spore-forming bacterium pathogenic to various insect species. This property is due to the Cry toxins encoded by plasmid genes and mostly produced during sporulation. B. thuringiensis contains a remarkable amount of extrachromosomal DNA molecules and a great number of plasmid rap-phr genes. Rap-Phr quorum sensing systems regulate different bacterial processes, notably the commitment to sporulation in Bacillus species. Rap proteins are quorum sensors acting as phosphatases on Spo0F, intermediate of the sporulation phosphorelay, and are inhibited by Phr peptides that function as signaling molecules. In this study, we characterize the Rap63-Phr63 system encoded by the pAW63 plasmid from the B. thuringiensis var. kurstaki HD73 strain. Rap63 has a moderate activity on sporulation and is inhibited by the Phr63 peptide. The rap63-phr63 genes are co-transcribed and the phr63 gene is also transcribed from a &#963;H-specific promoter. We show that Rap63-Phr63 regulates the sporulation together with the Rap8-Phr8 system harbored by the plasmid pHT8_1 of the HD73 strain. Interestingly, the deletion of both phr63 and phr8 genes in the same strain has a greater negative effect in sporulation than the sum of the loss of each phr gene. Despite the similarities in the Phr8 and Phr63 sequences, there is no crosstalk between the two systems. Our results suggest a synergism of these two Rap-Phr systems in the regulation of sporulation of B. thuringiensis at the end of the infectious cycle in insect, thus pointing out the role of the plasmids to the fitness of the bacteria.IMPORTANCEThe life cycle of Bacillus thuringiensis in insect larvae is regulated by quorum sensing systems of the RNPP family. After the toxemia caused by Cry insecticidal toxins, the sequential activation of these systems allows the bacteria to trigger a state of virulence (regulated by PlcR-PapR), then a necrotrophic lifestyle (regulated by NprR-NprX) and ultimately the sporulation is controlled by the Rap-Phr systems. Our study describes a new rap-phr operon carried by a B. thuringiensis plasmid and shows that the Rap protein has a moderate effect on sporulation. However, in combination with another plasmid rap-phr operon, both systems provide an effective control of sporulation when the bacteria develop in the cadavers of infected insect larvae. Overall, this study highlights the important adaptive role of the plasmid Rap-Phr systems in the developmental fate and the survival of B. thuringiensis within their ecological niche.","Cardoso, Priscilla; Fazion, Fernanda; Perchat, Stéphane; Buisson, Christophe; Vilas-Bôas, Gislayne; Lereclus, Didier",,,239

METHODS: For 5 weeks, we carried out a cross-sectional study consisting of telephone interviews of SLE patients. We collected epidemiological data, symptoms suggesting COVID-19, results of nasopharyngeal swabs, and ongoing treatments. In those patients who required hospital admission, clinical, radiological, and laboratory features, and outcome were investigated. RESULTS: Four hundred patients with SLE completed the survey. Overall, 4 (1.00%, 95%CI 0.02-1.98) patients were classified as confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 26 (6.51%, 95%CI 4.08-8.94) as possible clinical cases. The incidence of confirmed cases in our series was similar to that of the Catalan population (1.00% versus 0.63%; p = 0.456), whereas the incidence of possible cases was higher in our series (6.51% versus 1.29%; p < 0.005).

Earlier disaster studies have shown the importance of including older peoples' voices to prevent secondary stressors, yet these voices have received little attention during this pandemic. Here, we explore how Dutch older adults view this crisis and cope with measures to contribute to our understanding of coping of older adults in general and during disaster situations more specifically. METHODS: Qualitative study using semi-structured telephone interviews with 59 diverse older adults aged 54 to 95 throughout the Netherlands. RESULTS: Older adults typify this crisis as ungraspable, disrupting their daily and social lives. Despite filling their lives with activities, they experience loss or lack of purpose. They try to follow measures to decrease infection risk and gain control, and use problem- and emotion-focused coping strategies. Emotion-focused strategies used were interpreting their personal vulnerability, self-enhancing comparisons, acceptance, and distraction. In the latter two strategies, the temporary nature of measures was emphasized. DISCUSSION: Older adults describe this crisis consistently with earlier findings from disaster studies. They use known coping strategies, but emphasize the duration in relation to their expectation of temporality. This underscores a dynamic, processual approach towards coping that incorporates temporal dimensions such as duration and order. Our findings stress the importance of acknowledging heterogeneity among older adults and adjusting communication about mitigation measures to decrease insecurity and increase resonance. This may make COVID-19 mitigation measures more manageable and age-responsible and allow older adults to start living again.","Verhage, Miriam; Thielman, Lucia; de Kock, Lieke; Lindenberg, J",,,239

Indeed, the top 15 countries affected by COVID-19 host about 9 million refugees, and it is, therefore, important to investigate and strengthen the readiness of countries' health policies to ensure they are well equipped to deal with potential large influxes of 'epidemic-related refugees and migrants.' Using the Bardach Policy Framework as a tool for analysis, this article investigates the readiness of countries for a potential public health event (mass migration generated by future pandemics), therefore, aiming at a health response forecasting exercise. The article reviews the policies put in place by countries who faced large influxes of migrants between 2011 and 2015 (the policy-prolific years between the Arab Spring migration and the introduction of stringent measures in Europe) and new evidence generated in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (including the 'ECDC Guidance on infection prevention and control of COVID-19 in migrant and refugee reception and detention centres in the EU/EEA and the UK' and the 'WHO Lancet priority for dealing with migration and COVID-19') to formulate a policy option able to strengthen national system capacities for responding to influxes of epidemic-related migrants and the management of highly infectious diseases.","Dembech, Matteo; Katz, Zoltan; Szilard, Istvan",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,239

279132,The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on congenital heart surgery practice: An alarming change in demographics,2020,"The sequence diversity of viral populations within individual hosts is the starting material for selection and subsequent evolution of RNA viruses such as foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). Using next-generation sequencing (NGS) performed on a Genome Analyzer platform (Illumina), this study compared the viral populations within two bovine epithelial samples (foot lesions) from a single animal with the Inoculum used to initiate experimental infection. Genomic sequences were determined in duplicate sequencing runs, and the consensus sequence determined by NGS, for the Inoculum, was identical to that previously determined using the Sanger method. However, NGS reveals the fine polymorphic sub-structure of the viral population, from nucleotide variants present at just below 50% frequency to those present at fractions of 1%. Some of the higher frequency polymorphisms identified encoded changes within codons associated with heparan sulphate binding and were present in both feet lesions revealing intermediate stages in the evolution of a tissue-culture adapted virus replicating within a mammalian host. We identified 2,622, 1,434 and 1,703 polymorphisms in the Inoculum, and in the two foot lesions respectively: most of the substitutions occurred only in a small fraction of the population and represent the progeny from recent cellular replication prior to onset of any selective pressures. We estimated an upper limit for the genome-wide mutation rate of the virus within a cell to be 7.8 x 10-4 per nt. The greater depth of detection, achieved by NGS, demonstrates that this method is a powerful and valuable tool for the dissection of FMDV populations within-hosts.","Morelli, Marco J.; Wright, Caroline F.; Th'ebaud, Gael; Knowles, Nick J.; Herzyk, Pawel; Paton, David J.; Haydon, Daniel T.; King, Donald P.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1101.5371v1.pdf,239
279908,[Structure of hospital care for COVID-19 patients up to July 2020 in Germany],2021,"Silver nanoparticles (Ag NP) were produced utilizing leaf extract of rice cultivar Taichung native-1. Various factors like leaf extract, silver nitrate concentrations, and duration of autoclaving were standardized during synthesis. Nanoparticles were analyzed with UV-visible absorption spectroscopy (UV-vis), dynamic light scattering, zeta potential, X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy techniques. The synthesis was noted at 0.4% extract, 0.6 mM silver nitrate, 30 min of autoclaving and NP formation was confirmed from 424 nm peak in UV-vis. NP showed zeta potential of - 27 mV, face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal nature and sized around 16.5 ± 5.9 nm. Biogenic NP synthesized from susceptible rice variety were used as an antibacterial agent against phytopathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), the causative agent of bacterial leaf blight (BLB) disease in rice. Antibacterial effect of Ag NP was evaluated using in vitro assays and in vivo efficacy under greenhouse conditions. Results confirmed effective inhibition of Xoo growth and colony formation by Ag NP and found to be the more powerful antibacterial agent. Besides, Ag NP treatment (10 µg/mL) caused an enhancement in seedling vigor index. Pots treated with Ag NP (15 µg/mL) in vivo in greenhouse showed disease severity of 26.6% and disease decrease over control of 49.2%, at a much lower NP concentration than earlier reported studies. Thus, the current report implies using the leaf extract synthesized Ag NP to control and BLB disease management in field conditions.","Namburi, Karunakar Reddy; Kora, Aruna Jyothi; Chetukuri, Anuradha; Kota, Vijaya Sree Meena Kumari",Bioprocess biosyst. eng,,239

The unprecedented velocity of spread of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak represents a critical need for prevention strategies. Vaccines are recently being available and antiviral drugs have shown limited efficacy in COVID-19 patients. Thus, it is needed to know how to reduce the infectivity of the virus by different physicochemical conditions in order to prevent exposure to contaminated material. This work describes heating and irradiating UV-C light procedures to reduce the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 belonging to different three lineages. Results of physicochemical treatment showed no differences among viral lineages.

SUMMARY: In a health system based in Illinois and Wisconsin, pharmacy services are provided by a single, integrated department responsible for all aspects of pharmaceutical care within the organization. Hospital, retail, ambulatory care, and population health services are all managed under one leadership team. All pertinent ancillary services are also managed within the department, including informatics, supply chain, and drug policy. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the pharmacy services leadership has successfully managed volume and capacity challenges by redirecting resources to where they are needed. A disaster response framework based on Federal Emergency Management Agency guidance was put in place, and change management principles were used to rapidly operationalize change. Components of the nimble response have included quickly increasing capacity, thoughtful and timely communication to all team members, strategic decision making with available data, creating an agile pool of labor, and maintaining an efficient system supply chain. Well-being and resilience are emphasized alongside reflection on lessons learned. Some changes made in the urgent response to the pandemic are being considered for long-term implementation. CONCLUSION: Organizations have the potential to respond to almost any situation if they are integrated and teams work together to build flexibility. The keys to success are thoughtful maximization of existing resources and strong communication.","Hannan, Ryan J; Lundholm, Margaret K; Brierton, Dennis; Chapman, Noelle R M",Am. j. health system pharm,,239

Objective: To assess US adults' preferences regarding COVID-19 vaccine prioritization. Design, Setting, and Participants: This survey study involved 2 independent, online surveys of US adults aged 18 years and older, 1 conducted by Gallup from September 14 to 27, 2020, and the other conducted by the COVID Collaborative from September 19 to 25, 2020. Samples were weighted to reflect sociodemographic characteristics of the US population. Exposures: Respondents were asked to prioritize groups for COVID-19 vaccine and to rank their prioritization considerations. Main Outcomes and Measures: The study assessed prioritization preferences and agreement with the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine's Preliminary Framework for Equitable Allocation of COVID-19 Vaccine. Results: A total of 4735 individuals participated, 2730 (1474 men [54.1%]; mean [SD] age, 59.2 [14.5] years) in the Gallup survey and 2005 (944 men [47.1%]; 203 participants [21.5%] aged 55-59 years) in the COVID Collaborative survey. In both the Gallup COVID-19 Panel and COVID Collaborative surveys, respondents listed health care workers (Gallup, 93.6% [95% CI, 91.2%-95.3%]; COVID Collaborative, 80.0% [95% CI, 78.0%-81.9%]) and adults of any age with serious comorbid conditions (Gallup, 78.6% [95% CI, 75.2%-81.7%]; COVID Collaborative, 72.9% [95% CI, 70.7%-74.9%]) among their 4 highest priority groups. Respondents of all political affiliations agreed with prioritizing Black, Hispanic, Native American, and other communities that have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 (Gallup, 74.2% [95% CI, 70.6%-77.5%]; COVID Collaborative, 84.9% [95% CI, 83.1%-86.5%]), and COVID Collaborative respondents were willing to be preceded in line by teachers and childcare workers (92.5%; 95% CI, 91.2%-93.7%) and grocery workers (85.9%; 95% CI, 84.2%-87.5%). Older respondents in both surveys were significantly less likely than younger respondents to prioritize healthy adults aged 65 years and older among their 4 highest priority groups (Gallup, 23.7% vs 39.1% [&#967;2 = 2160.8; P < .001]; COVID Collaborative, 23.3% vs 28.8% [&#967;2 = 5.0198; P = .03]). COVID Collaborative respondents believed the 4 most important considerations for prioritization were preventing COVID-19 spread (78.4% [95% CI, 76.3%-80.3%]), preventing the most deaths (72.1% [95% CI, 69.9%-74.2%]), preventing long-term complications (68.9% [66.6%-71.9%]), and protecting frontline workers (63.8% [95% CI, 61.5%-66.1%]). Conclusions and Relevance: US adults broadly agreed with the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine's prioritization framework. Respondents endorsed prioritizing racial/ethnic communities that are disproportionately affected by COVID-19, and older respondents were significantly less likely than younger respondents to endorse prioritizing healthy people older than 65 years. This provides reason for caution about COVID-19 vaccine distribution plans that prioritize healthy adults older than a cutoff age without including those younger than that age with preexisting conditions, that aim solely to prevent the most deaths, or that give no priority to frontline workers or disproportionately affected communities.","Persad, Govind; Emanuel, Ezekiel J; Sangenito, Samantha; Glickman, Aaron; Phillips, Steven; Largent, Emily A",JAMA Netw Open,,239

One of the efficient methods to evaluate response to vaccination is the assessment of humoral immunity by measuring Sars-Cov-2 antibody titer. Identification of factors that affect the humoral response is important so as to ameliorate the responses to vaccination or identify vulnerable groups that may need vaccination boosters. ObjectiveWe investigated the effect of anthropometric parameters (age, BMI), smoking, diabetes, statin use hypertension and levels of 25(OH)D and DHEAS to the Sars-Cov-2 antibody titer. MethodsIn this longitudinal observational cohort study 712 subjects were tested for Sars-Cov-2 antibodies 3 months after the second dose of BNT162b2 vaccine. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to identify which factors are associated with the antibody titer. ResultsWe identified age to be negatively associated with antibody titer (p=0.0073) and male sex (p=0.0008). However, interaction of age and gender was significant (p<0.0001) highlighting the finding that only after the age of 40 years men had lower antibody levels than women. DHEAS, an aging marker, was not associated with the antibody titer. Smoking was also associated with low antibody titer (p=0.0008) while overweight or obese subjects did not have different antibody response compared to normal weight individuals. Although diabetic and hypertensive subjects trended towards lower antibody titer, this association was not statistically significant. Replete vitamin D levels were associated with higher antibody titers (p=0.00422). ConclusionsAge, male sex and smoking negatively affects antibody titer while 25(OH)D is associated with increased Sars-Cov-2 antibody titers.","Parthymou, Anastasia; Habeos, Evagelia E; Habeos, George I; Deligakis, Apostolos; Livieratos, Ektoras; Marangos, Markos; Chartoumpekis, Dionysios V",,,239

This study analysed research collaboration, interventions and outcome measures in registered SRs on COVID-19 treatments and pointed out the relevant problems. PROSPERO (international prospective register of systematic reviews) was searched for SRs on COVID-19 treatments as of 2 June 2020. Excel 2016 was used for descriptive analyses of the extracted data. VOSviewer 1.6.14 software was used to generate network maps for collaborations between countries and institutions. A total of 189 SRs were included, which were registered by 301 institutions from 39 countries. China (69, 36.50%) exhibited the highest output. Cooperation between countries was not close enough. As an institution, the Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (7, 3.70%) had the highest output. There was close cooperation between institutions. Interventions included antiviral therapy (81, 42.86%), respiratory support (16, 8.47%), circulatory support (11, 5.82%), plasma therapy for convalescent patients (11, 5.82%), immunotherapy (9, 4.76%), TCM (traditional Chinese medicine) treatment (9, 4.76%), rehabilitation treatment (5, 2.65%), anti-inflammatory treatment (16, 8.47%) and other treatments (31, 16.40%). Concerning antiviral therapy (81, 42.86%), the most commonly used antiviral agents were chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (26, 13.76%), followed by remdesivir (12, 6.35%), lobinavir/ritonavir (11, 5.82%), favipiravir (5, 2.65%), ribavirin (5, 2.65%), interferon (5, 2.65%), abiron (4, 2.12%) and abidor (4, 2.12%). The most frequently used primary and secondary outcomes were the mortality rate (92, 48.68%) and hospital stay length (48, 25.40%), respectively. The expression of the outcomes was not standardised. Many COVID-19 SRs on treatment modalities have been registered, with a low completion rate. Although there was some collaboration between countries and institutions in the currently registered SRs on treatment modalities for COVID-19 on PROSPERO, cooperation between countries should be further enhanced. More attention should be directed towards identifying deficiencies of outcome measures, and the standardisation of results should be maximised.","Zhang, Ruinian; Gao, Ya; Xie, Dairong; Lian, Rongna; Tian, Jinhui",Epidemiol Infect,,239

293519,A review of the stability of coronaviruses in different environments,2021,"BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic presents a threat to health care systems worldwide. Trauma centers may be uniquely impacted, given the need for rapid invasive interventions in severely injured and the growing incidence of community infection. We discuss the impact that SARS-CoV-2 has had in our trauma center and our steps to limit the potential exposures. METHODS: We performed a retrospective evaluation of the trauma service, from March 16 to 30, following the appearance of SARS-CoV-2 in our state. We recorded the daily number of trauma patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection, the presence of clinical symptoms or radiological signs of COVID-19, and the results of verbal symptom screen (for new admissions). The number of trauma activations, admissions, and census, as well as staff exposures and infections, was recorded daily. RESULTS: Over the 14-day evaluation period, we tested 85 trauma patients for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 21 (25%) were found to be positive. Sixty percent of the patients in the trauma/burn intensive care unit were infected with SARS-CoV-2. Positive verbal screen results, presence of ground glass opacities on admission chest CT, and presence of clinical symptoms were not significantly different in patients with or without SARS-CoV-2 infection (p > 0.05). Many infected patients were without clinical symptoms (9/21, 43%) or radiological signs on admission (18/21, 86%) of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Forty-five percent of trauma patients are asymptomatic at the time of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Respiratory symptoms, as well as verbal screening (recent fevers, shortness of breath, cough, international travel, and close contact with known SARS-CoV-2 carriers), are inaccurate in the trauma population. These findings demonstrate the need for comprehensive rapid testing of all trauma patients upon presentation to the trauma bay.

294159,Effectiveness of aerobic exercise training program on cardio-respiratory fitness and quality of life in patients recovered from COVID-19,2021,"BackgroundWe examined school reopening policies amidst rising transmission of the highly transmissible Delta variant, accounting for vaccination among individuals aged 12 years and older, with the goal of characterizing risk to students and teachers under various within-school non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) combined with specific vaccination coverage levels. MethodsWe developed an individual-based transmission model to simulate transmission of the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 among a synthetic population, representative of Bay Area cities. We parameterized the model using community contact rates from vaccinated households ascertained from a household survey of Bay Area families with children conducted between February - April, 2021. Interventions and outcomesWe evaluated the additional infections in students and teachers/staff resulting over a 128-day semester from in-school instruction compared to remote instruction when various NPIs (mask use, cohorts, and weekly testing of students/teachers) were implemented in schools, across various community-wide vaccination coverages (50%, 60%, 70%), and student ([≥]12 years) and teacher/staff vaccination coverages (50% - 95%). We quantified the added benefit of universal masking over masking among unvaccinated students and teachers, across varying levels of vaccine effectiveness (45%, 65%, 85%), and compared results between Delta and Alpha variant circulation. ResultsThe Delta variant sharply increases the risk of within-school COVID-transmission when compared to the Alpha variant. In our highest risk scenario (50% community and within-school vaccine coverage, no within-school NPIs, and predominant circulation of the Delta variant), we estimated that an elementary school could see 33-65 additional symptomatic cases of COVID-19 over a four-month semester (depending on the relative susceptibility of children <10 years). In contrast, under the Bay Area reopening plan (universal mask use, community and school vaccination coverage of 70%), we estimated excess symptomatic infection attributable to school reopening among 2.0-9.7% of elementary students (8-36 excess symptomatic cases per school over the semester), 3.0% of middle school students (13 cases per school) and 0.4% of high school students (3 cases per school). Excess rates among teachers attributable to reopening were similar. Achievement of lower risk tolerances, such as <5 excess infections per 1,000 students or teachers, required a cohort approach in elementary and middle school populations. In the absence of NPIs, increasing the vaccination coverage of community members from 50% to 70% or elementary teachers from 70% to 95% reduced the estimated excess rate of infection among elementary school students attributable to school transmission by 24% and 41%, respectively. We estimated that with 70% coverage of the eligible community and school population with a vaccine that is [≤]65% effective, universal masking can avert more cases than masking of unvaccinated persons alone. ConclusionsAmidst circulation of the Delta variant, our findings demonstrated that schools are not inherently low risk, yet can be made so with high community vaccination coverages and universal masking. Vaccination of adult community members and teachers protects unvaccinated elementary and middle school children. Elementary and middle schools that can support additional interventions, such as cohorts and testing, should consider doing so, particularly if additional studies find that younger children are equally as susceptible as adults to the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2. LimitationsWe did not consider the effect of social distancing in classrooms, or variation in testing frequency, and considerable uncertainty remains in key transmission parameters.","Head, Jennifer R; Andrejko, Kristin L; Remais, Justin V",,,239
294162,Diagnostic and prognostic values of cutaneous manifestations in COVID-19,2020,"We present a simple analytical model to describe the fast increase of deaths produced by the corona virus (COVID-19) infections. The 'D' (deaths) model comes from a simplified version of the SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) model known as SI model. It assumes that there is no recovery. In that case the dynamical equations can be solved analytically and the result is extended to describe the D-function that depends on three parameters that we can fit to the data. Results for the data from Spain, Italy and China are presented. The model is validated by comparing with the data of deaths in China, which are well described. This allows to make predictions for the development of the disease in Spain and Italy.","Amaro, J. E.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.13747v1.pdf,239

The purpose of this study is to give tentative predictions of the epidemic peak for Russia, Brazil, India and Bangladesh which could become the next COVID-19 hotspots in no time by using a newly developed algorithm based on well-known Trust-region-reflective (TRR) algorithm, which is one of the robust real-time optimization techniques. Based on the publicly available epidemiological data from late January until 10 May, it has been estimated that the number of daily new symptomatic infectious cases for the above mentioned countries could reach the peak around the middle of June with the peak size of ∼ 15, 774 (95% CI, 12,814–16,734) symptomatic infectious cases in Russia, ∼ 26, 449 (95% CI, 25,489–31,409) cases in Brazil, ∼ 9, 504 (95% CI, 8,378–13,630) cases in India and ∼ 2, 209 (95% CI, 2,078–2,840) cases in Bangladesh if current epidemic trends hold. As of May 11, 2020, incorporating the infectiousness capability of asymptomatic carriers, our analysis estimates the value of the basic reproductive number (R 0) was found to be ∼ 4.234 (95% CI, 3.764–4.7) in Russia, ∼ 5.347 (95% CI, 4.737–5.95) in Brazil, ∼ 5.218 (95% CI, 4.56–5.81) in India, ∼ 4.649 (95% CI, 4.17–5.12) in the United Kingdom and ∼ 3.53 (95% CI, 3.12–3.94) in Bangladesh. Moreover, Latin hypercube sampling-partial rank correlation coefficient (LHS-PRCC) which is a global sensitivity analysis (GSA) method has been applied to quantify the uncertainty of our model mechanisms, which elucidates that for Russia, the recovery rate of undetected asymptomatic carriers, the rate of getting home-quarantined or self-quarantined and the transition rate from quarantined class to susceptible class are the most influential parameters, whereas the rate of getting home-quarantined or self-quarantined and the inverse of the COVID-19 incubation period are highly sensitive parameters in Brazil, India, Bangladesh and the United Kingdom which could significantly affect the transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Our analysis also suggests that relaxing social distancing restrictions too quickly could exacerbate the epidemic outbreak in the above-mentioned countries.","Nabi, Khondoker Nazmoon",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,239
295356,Care of patients with liver disease during the COVID-19 pandemic: EASL-ESCMID position paper,2020,"Since discovered in Hubei, China in December 2019, Corona Virus Disease 2019 named COVID-19 has lasted mor than one year, and the number of new confirmed cases and confirmed deaths is still at a high level. COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. Although RT-PCR is considered the gold standard for detection of COVID-19, CT plays an important role in the diagnosis and evaluation of the therapeutic effect of COVID-19. Diagnosis and localization of COVID-19 on CT images using deep learning can provide quantitative auxiliary information for doctors. This article proposes a novel network with multi-receptive field attention module to diagnose COVID-19 on CT images. This attention module includes three parts, a pyramid convolution module (PCM), a multi-receptive field spatial attention block (SAB), and a multi-receptive field channel attention block (CAB). The PCM can improve the diagnostic ability of the network for lesions of different sizes and shapes. The role of SAB and CAB is to focus the features extracted from the network on the lesion area to improve the ability of COVID-19 discrimination and localization. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed method on two datasets. The accuracy rate of 97.12%, specificity of 96.89%, and sensitivity of 97.21% are achieved by the proposed network on DTDB dataset provided by the Beijing Ditan Hospital Capital Medical University. Compared with other state-of-the-art attention modules, the proposed method achieves better result. As for the public COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2 dataset, 95.16% for accuracy, 95.6% for F1-score and 99.01% for AUC are obtained. The proposed network can effectively assist doctors in the diagnosis of COVID-19 CT images.","Ma, Xia; Zheng, Bingbing; Zhu, Yu; Yu, Fuli; Zhang, Rixin; Chen, Budong",Optik (Stuttg),,239

Here, we review current data on suspected myocarditis in the course of severe acute respiratory syndrome novel coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Hypothetical mechanisms to explain the pathogenesis of troponin release in patients with novel coronavirus disease 2019 include direct virus-induced myocardial injury (ie, viral myocarditis), systemic hyperinflammatory response (ie, cytokine storm), hypoxemia, downregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, systemic virus-induced endothelialitis, and type 1 and type 2 myocardial infarction. To date, despite the fact that millions of SARS-CoV-2 infections have been diagnosed worldwide, there is no definitive proof that SARS-CoV-2 is a novel cardiotropic virus causing direct cardiomyocyte damage. Diagnosis of viral myocarditis should be based on the molecular assessment of endomyocardial biopsy or autopsy by polymerase chain reaction or in-situ hybridization. Blood, sputum, or nasal and throat swab virology testing are insufficient and do not correlate with the myocardial involvement of a given pathogen. Data from endomyocardial biopsies and autopsies in clinically suspected SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis are scarce. Overall, current clinical epidemiologic data do not support the hypothesis that viral myocarditis is caused by SARS-CoV-2, or that it is common. More endomyocardial biopsy and autopsy data are also needed for a better understanding of pathogenesis of clinically suspected myocarditis in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which may include virus-negative immune-mediated or already established subclinical autoimmune forms, triggered or accelerated by the hyperinflammatory state of severe novel coronavirus disease 2019.","Ozieranski, Krzysztof; Tyminska, Agata; Jonik, Szymon; Marcolongo, Renzo; Baritussio, Anna; Grabowski, Marcin; Filipiak, Krzysztof J; Opolski, Grzegorz; Caforio, Alida L P",J. card. fail,,239

The local medical service is key to the municipality's healthcare preparedness. We wished to investigate how the healthcare personnel perceived the restructuring at their GP practice during the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020, and the factors that facilitated and impeded the process. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The article is based on a focus group interview that was conducted with eight nurses and medical secretaries at Otta GP practice in June 2020. The interview was transcribed and analysed using systematic text condensation. RESULTS: The informants described a chaotic and demanding situation, in which they had to deal with their own as well as the patients' fears. They found crisis management to be difficult in a situation where the leadership in the municipality were unaware of the challenges of the GP practice. Lack of guidelines from the authorities at the start of the outbreak gave rise to considerable uncertainty. Through collaboration and flexibility, the practice arrived at new ways of working in order to safeguard its running. This gave a strong feeling of coping and fellowship, and a greater awareness of the informants' own importance in the front line of crisis management. INTERPRETATION: The study elucidates the role of support staff in the face of a crisis for the GP practice. Competent employees with the latitude and tools to tackle the challenges quickly guided the practice from chaos to a new type of working day. The municipality could have supported the process by ensuring the necessary resources and general guidelines for prioritisation of tasks.","Renaa, Therese; Brekke, Mette",Tidsskr. nor. laegeforen.,,239

These findings were obtained in surveys using self-report questionnaires with pre-specified response options that may not capture the broad range of experiences of individuals affected by cancer, including people with cancer and informal caregivers, in this unprecedented situation. Online forums produce a large amount of valuable first-hand user-generated content that can be used to better understand their day-to-day lives. This study, based on the analysis of narratives in cancer online forums, aims to describe and categorize the experiences of people affected by cancer during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: An inductive, descriptive, thematic approach was applied to publicly available cancer forums from Germany, the USA, the UK, and Ireland posted between mid-March and mid-April 2020. RESULTS: An analysis of the content of 230 main posts revealed three major themes: (1) concerns related to the impact of COVID-19 on cancer care, the risks and fears of getting infected, logistic issues, and economic impact; (2) adaptation challenges faced at the individual and societal level; and (3) the need for advice including information about COVID-19 and the (self-)management of cancer symptoms and treatment. CONCLUSION: Our qualitative description of the experiences of people affected by cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak can help to improve communication, education, and the development of supportive care strategies. Furthermore, the themes and subthemes identified could potentially inform item development for future self-report questionnaires.","Colomer-Lahiguera, Sara; Ribi, Karin; Dunnack, Hayley J; Cooley, Mary E; Hammer, Marilyn J; Miaskowski, Christine; Eicher, Manuela",Support. care cancer,,239

Patients with cancer might have a worse outcome, because of the immunosuppression determined by the tumor itself and anti-cancer treatments, including chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The impact and course of viral infection in patients receiving immunotherapy remains unknown. We report the case of a patient with metastatic melanoma, long responder to anti PD-1 blockade who got infected with Sars CoV-2, recovering without sequelae. A critical review of literature was performed. Limited data available in literature support the possibility to continue the immunotherapy in patients with cancer under control.","Pala, Laura; Conforti, Fabio; Cocorocchio, Emilia; Ferrucci, Pierfrancesco; De Pas, Martino Tommaso; Stucchi, Sara; Repetto, Matteo; Saponara, Maristella; Queirolo, Paola",Cancer Invest,,239

305460,COVID-19 and Orthopaedic Surgery: Experiences from Iran,2020,"Greece is a European-Union country, of around 10 million people, located in the southeast part of Europe. The economy is recovering from a long period of deep recession, due to the economic crisis that started in 2008. The economic problems greatly influenced the structure and resources of the healthcare system of the country. In addition to the economic challenges, the country has been facing a refugee crisis, characterized by many overcrowded hotspots and tensions with neighboring Turkey. The COVID-19 outbreak arrived in Greece on 26 February 2020, at the time that Athens had declared a state of emergency at the Greek/Turkish border. From this point in time the government enforced a series of measurements, aiming to contain the epidemic and avoid the collapse of the healthcare system. The vast majority of the general population complied to the measures and consequently Greece's death toll was low. The impacts of the outbreak are expected to be, as everywhere worldwide, multifaceted and to affect many parts of the economic, social and political life of the country.","Kousi, Timokleia; Mitsi, Lefkothea-Christina; Simos, Jean",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,239
305783,COVID-19 and the Cancer Patient: What Every Physician Needs to Know,2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the pathogen responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which has resulted in global healthcare crises and strained health resources. As the population of patients recovering from COVID-19 grows, it is paramount to establish an understanding of the healthcare issues surrounding them. COVID-19 is now recognized as a multi-organ disease with a broad spectrum of manifestations. Similarly to post-acute viral syndromes described in survivors of other virulent coronavirus epidemics, there are increasing reports of persistent and prolonged effects after acute COVID-19. Patient advocacy groups, many members of which identify themselves as long haulers, have helped contribute to the recognition of post-acute COVID-19, a syndrome characterized by persistent symptoms and/or delayed or long-term complications beyond 4 weeks from the onset of symptoms. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the current literature on post-acute COVID-19, its pathophysiology and its organ-specific sequelae. Finally, we discuss relevant considerations for the multidisciplinary care of COVID-19 survivors and propose a framework for the identification of those at high risk for post-acute COVID-19 and their coordinated management through dedicated COVID-19 clinics.","Nalbandian, Ani; Sehgal, Kartik; Gupta, Aakriti; Madhavan, Mahesh V; McGroder, Claire; Stevens, Jacob S; Cook, Joshua R; Nordvig, Anna S; Shalev, Daniel; Sehrawat, Tejasav S; Ahluwalia, Neha; Bikdeli, Behnood; Dietz, Donald; Der-Nigoghossian, Caroline; Liyanage-Don, Nadia; Rosner, Gregg F; Bernstein, Elana J; Mohan, Sumit; Beckley, Akinpelumi A; Seres, David S; Choueiri, Toni K; Uriel, Nir; Ausiello, John C; Accili, Domenico; Freedberg, Daniel E; Baldwin, Matthew; Schwartz, Allan; Brodie, Daniel; Garcia, Christine Kim; Elkind, Mitchell S V; Connors, Jean M; Bilezikian, John P; Landry, Donald W; Wan, Elaine Y",Nat Med,,239

Data were collected between June and August 2020. The sample was comprised of 189 first responders (M age = 47.58, SD = 10.93; 21% female), recruited nationally, who completed an online survey. Results indicated that COVID-19-exposed first responders were more likely to be emergency medical services [EMS] personnel (vs. non-EMS) in career (vs. volunteer) roles. COVID-19-exposed first responders reported higher alcohol use severity; no other between-group differences were noted. COVID-19-related worry and medical vulnerability were incrementally associated with more severe symptoms of anxiety and depression; only COVID-19-related worry was associated with alcohol use severity. Among the subset of first responders (n = 122) who reported COVID-19 exposure, COVID-19-related worry was significantly associated with PTSD symptom severity. Covariates included gender, trauma load, years as a first responder, and COVID-19 exposure.

308444,Immune deficiency is a risk factor for severe COVID-19 in people living with HIV,2020,"The pandemic of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) seriously threatened the public health all over the world. A colloidal gold immunochromatography assay for IgM/IgG antibodies against the receptor-binding domain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) S1 protein was established to assess its rapid diagnostic value. We first designed and manufactured all contents of the test cassette of SARS-CoV-2 rapid test kit: the colloidal gold-labeled mouse-antihuman lgM/lgG antibody, the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 antigen, the nitrocellulose membrane control line, and specimen diluents. Furthermore, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, colloidal gold immunochromatography assay, serological validation of cross reaction with other common viruses, and clinical validation were performed. The kit was finally evaluated by 75 serum/plasma samples of SARS-CoV-2 infection cases and 139 healthy samples as control, with the result of that the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for IgM were 90.67%, 97.84%, and 95.33%, whereas for IgG were 69.33%, 99.28%, and 88.79%, respectively; the combination of IgM and IgG could improve the value: 92.00%, 97.12%, and 95.33%, respectively. Therefore, the rapid detection kit has high sensitivity and specificity, especially for IgM&IgG, showing a critical value in clinical application and epidemic control of COVID-19.","Li, Hua; Liu, Zhe; He, Yue; Qi, Yingjie; Chen, Jie; Ma, Yuanyuan; Liu, Fujia; Lai, Kaisheng; Zhang, Yong; Jiang, Liu; Wang, Xiangdong; Ge, Junbo",,,239

We aimed to investigate the psychosocial effects of the pandemic and reveal the follow-up characteristics. METHODS: The single center, cross-sectional, web-based survey study included patients with acromegaly and CD, PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients and healthy volunteers without known any chronic disease. The semi-structured sociodemographic data form, The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) were used. RESULTS: We examined 583 people (217 acromegaly, 127 CD, 102 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients and 137 healthy controls). The frequency of abnormal state anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were similar in patients with acromegaly and CD and healthy controls, and higher in PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients than in these three groups (p < 0.001 for both). The frequency of abnormal trait anxiety was higher in patients with acromegaly and PCR-confirmed COVID-19 compared to patients with CD and healthy controls (p = 0.027, p < 0.001, respectively). There were no significant differences between the acromegaly and CD groups in terms of follow-up characteristics and perception of the severity of the COVID-19 outbreak (p > 0.05 for all). But, the treatment discontinuation rate was higher in patients with acromegaly than CD (p = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that acromegaly and CD patients are psychologically less affected than PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients and exhibit similar findings the general population. The clinicians should consider the psychosocial effects, as well as focus on the regular follow-up and medical treatments of these patients during the outbreak.","Durcan, Emre; Turan, Senol; Sahin, Serdar; Sulu, Cem; Taze, Sabriye Sibel; Kavla, Yasin; Ozkaya, Hande Mefkure; Kadioglu, Pinar",Pituitary,,239

Reciprocal ID50 pseudovirus neutralizing antibody geometric mean titers (GMT) against live SARS-CoV-2 D614G and the {beta} variant, were 4700 and 765, respectively, at week 6, the peak of primary response, and 644 and 553, respectively, at a 5-month post-vaccination memory time point. Two weeks following homologous or heterologous boost {beta}-specific reciprocal ID50 GMT were 5000 and 3000, respectively. At week 38, animals were challenged in the upper and lower airway with the {beta} variant. Two days post-challenge, viral replication was low to undetectable in both BAL and nasal swabs in most of the boosted animals. These data show that boosting with the homologous mRNA-1273 vaccine six months after primary immunization provides up to a 20-fold increase in neutralizing antibody responses across all VOC, which may be required to sustain high-level protection against severe disease, especially for at-risk populations.

Cross-sectional data from the early months of the pandemic indicates that approximately one-third of adults in multiple nations are hesitant or resistant to a vaccine for COVID-19. Using longitudinal data, we tracked changes in attitudes to COVID-19 vaccination during the pandemic. STUDY DESIGN: This is a quantitative, longitudinal design. METHOD: Nationally representative samples of the adult general population of the Republic of Ireland (N = 1041) and the United Kingdom (N = 2025) were assessed for their attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination at three points from March to August 2020. RESULTS: Statistically significant increases in resistance to COVID-19 vaccination were observed in Irish (from 9.5% to 18.1%) and British (from 6.2% to 10%) adults. CONCLUSION: Resistance to vaccination has significantly increased in two European nations as the pandemic has progressed. Growing resistance to COVID-19 vaccination will pose a challenge to public health officials responsible for ensuring sufficient vaccine coverage.","Hyland, P; Vallières, F; Shevlin, M; Bentall, R P; McKay, R; Hartman, T K; McBride, O; Murphy, J",Public Health,,239

OBJECTIVES: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the prevalence of cardiac arrhythmias detected by the electrocardiogram and their relationships with adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: PubMed and Google were searched for studies that reported on cardiac arrhythmias and/or examined the relationship between arrhythmias and adverse outcomes. RESULTS: Thirty studies with 12,713 participants were included in the systematic review, and 28 studies (n = 12,499) in the meta-analysis. The mean age was 61.3 ± 16.8 years; 39.3% were female. In 25 studies with 7578 patients, the overall prevalence of cardiac arrhythmias was 10.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.4%-12.3%). The most common arrhythmias documented during hospitalization were supraventricular arrhythmias (6.2%, 95% CI: 4.4%-8.1%) followed by ventricular arrhythmias (2.5%, 95% CI: 1.8%-3.1%). The incidence of cardiac arrhythmias was higher among critically ill patients (relative risk [RR]: 12.1, 95% CI: 8.5-17.3) and among non-survivors (RR: 3.8, 95%, CI: 1.7-8.7). Eight studies reported changes in the QT interval. The prevalence of QTc > 500 ms was 12.3% (95% CI: 6.9%-17.8%). ST-segment deviation was reported in eight studies, with a pooled estimate of 8.7% (95% CI: 7.3% to 10.0%). CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis showed that QTc prolongation, ST-segment deviation, and various other cardiac arrhythmias were observed in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The presence of cardiac arrhythmias was associated with a worse prognosis.","Garcia-Zamora, Sebastian; Lee, Sharen; Haseeb, Sohaib; Bazoukis, George; Tse, Gary; Alvarez-Garcia, Jesus; Gul, Enes Elvin; Çinier, Göksel; Alexander, Bryce; Martins Pinto-Filho, Marcelo; Liu, Tong; Baranchuk, Adrian",Pacing Clin Electrophysiol,,239

PEx guidelines note insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the concomitant use of inhaled and IV antibiotics. OBJECTIVES: We hypothesize that the addition of inhaled antibiotics for PEx therapy is associated with improvements in lung function and a longer time to next PEx compared with standard IV antibiotics alone. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study using the CF Foundation Patient Registry-Pediatric Health Information System linked dataset. People with CF were included if hospitalized for PEx from 2006-2016 and 6-21 years of age. Lung function outcomes were assessed by linear mixed effect modeling and generalized estimating equations. Time to next PEx was assessed by Cox proportional hazards regression. To estimate independent causal effects while accounting for indication bias and other confounders, inverse probabilities of treatment weights were calculated based on covariates thought to influence the likelihood of inhaled antibiotic use during PEx treatment. RESULTS: 3,253 children and adolescents contributed 9,040 PEx events for analysis. Inhaled antibiotics were used in 23% of PEx events but were not associated with better pre- to post-PEx ppFEV1 responses (mean difference -1.11%, [95% CI -1.83, -0.38]; p=0.003), higher odds of returning to lung function baseline (odds ratio 0.94, [0.82, 1.07]; p=0.34), or longer time to next PEx (hazard ratio 1.05, [0.99, 1.12]; p=0.098). CONCLUSIONS: The addition of inhaled antibiotics to standard IV antibiotic PEx treatment was not associated with improved lung function outcomes or a longer time to next PEx.","Cogen, Jonathan D; Faino, Anna V; Onchiri, Frankline; Hoffman, Lucas R; Kronman, Matthew P; Nelson, Maria; Nichols, David P; Rosenfeld, Margaret; VanDevanter, Donald R; Gibson, Ronald L",Ann.

Human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (Ad-MSCs) exert immunomodulatory effects by inhibiting effector T cell responses and have been used to treat diverse immune disorders. We aimed to investigate the modulating effect of human Ad-MSCs on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with PD, focusing on differentiation into Th17 and Treg cells. Methods: We isolated human peripheral blood CD4+T cells and co-cultured them with Ad-MSCs at a ratio of 4:1 under either Th17 or Treg cell polarizing conditions for 4 days to detect the proportions of IL-17-producing CD4+T (Th17) and CD4+CD25+Foxp3+regulatory T (Treg) cells by flow cytometry. We also determined the mRNA expression levels of the retinoid-related orphan nuclear receptor (RORÎ³t) transcription factor and those of interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R), interleukin-23 receptor (IL-23R), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and LIF receptor (LIFR) by quantitative reverse transcription PCR. We detected levels of cytokines in the supernatant (including LIF, IL-6, IL-23, IL-10, and TGF-ß) using ELISA. Results: Our results showed that Ad-MSCs specifically inhibited the differentiation of PBMCs of patients with PD into IL-17-producing CD4+T cells by decreasing expressions of IL-6R, IL-23R, and RORÎ³t (the key transcription factor for Th17 cells). Moreover, Ad-MSCs induced a functional CD4+CD25+Foxp3+T regulatory cell phenotype as evidenced by the secretion of IL-10. The levels of IL-6, IL-23, and TGF-ß remained constant after co-culture under either the Th17 or the Treg cell polarizing condition. In addition, levels of LIF protein and its receptor mRNA were significantly increased under both polarizing conditions. Conclusion: The present in vitro study found that Ad-MSCs from healthy participants were able to correct the imbalance between Th17 and Treg found in PBMCs of PD patients, which were correlated with an increase in LIF secretion and a decrease in expression of IL-6R, IL-23R, and RORÎ³t. These findings should be confirmed by in vivo experiments.","Bi, Yong; Lin, Xiaobin; Liang, Huazheng; Yang, Dehao; Zhang, Xiaowei; Ke, Jianming; Xiao, Jingjing; Chen, Zhilin; Chen, Weian; Zhang, Xu; Wang, Shaoshi; Liu, Chun-Feng",Clin Interv Aging,,239

318356,"Ferritin and Severe COVID-19, from Clinical Observations to Pathogenic Implications and Therapeutic Perspectives",2020,"AIMS: : Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine ([hydroxy]chloroquine) are drugs used to treat malaria and rheumatological disorders and were recently suggested as beneficial for prevention and treatment of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, longitudinal studies to assess the electrocardiographic and cardiotoxic effects of these drugs are limited. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of these drugs on QTc-interval and incidence of sudden cardiac death (SCD). METHODS: We designed a longitudinal follow-up study of individuals within the prospective population-based Rotterdam Study. Eligible individuals had available data on medication and repeated ECG measurements. The study period was between 1 January 1991 and 1 January 2014. We studied on current and past use of [hydroxy]chloroquine as a time-varying exposure; high versus low daily dose of [hydroxy]chloroquine. QTc-interval duration, and the occurrence of SCD were the main outcomes. SCD was defined as an unexpected and sudden death due to cardiac arrhythmia within one hour of the onset of acute symptoms, and in patients without cardiac symptoms within 24 hours before death. RESULTS : Among the study population of 14 594 individuals (58.8% women) with an average age of 65 years, 346 patients used [hydroxy]chloroquine at any time during follow-up. The total number of SCD cases was 609. In a multiple linear mixed model analysis, the current use of [hydroxy]chloroquine was associated with a significantly increased duration of the QTc-interval of 8.1 ms (95% CI: 3.6; 12.6) compared with non-users. The association was stronger among current-high daily dosage [15.3 (95%CI: 7.0; 23.6)] compared with current-low daily dosage [5.5 (95%CI: 0.4; 10.7)] users. In a Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, the risk of SCD was significantly higher in participants who were current users of [hydroxy]chloroquine than in non-users [adjusted hazard ratio; 3.7 (95%CI: 1.1; 12.6)]. CONCLUSIONS : In this longitudinal study, persons who received [hydroxy]chloroquine had an increased QTc-interval duration and the association was dose-dependent. [Hydroxy]chloroquine was associated with a significantly increased risk of SCD. As long as their activity against COVID-19 is controversial, cardiotoxicity is a strong argument against using these drugs to treat COVID-19 infections.","Ahmadizar, Fariba; Soroush, Negin; Ikram, M Arfan; Kors, Jan A; Kavousi, Maryam; Stricker, Bruno H",,,239

320095,Airway Management in COVID-19: In the Den of the Beast,2020,"BACKGROUND: Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein serves as the host receptor for SARS-CoV-2, with a critical role in viral infection. We aim to understand population level variation of nasopharyngeal ACE2 transcription in people tested for COVID-19 and the relationship between ACE2 transcription and SARS-CoV-2 viral load, while adjusting for expression of: (i) the complementary protease, Transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), (ii) soluble ACE2, (iii) age, and (iv) biological sex. The ACE2 gene was targeted to measure expression of transmembrane and soluble transcripts. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of n = 424 ""participants"" aged 1-104 years referred for COVID-19 testing was performed in British Columbia, Canada. Patients who tested positive for COVID-19 were matched by age and biological sex to patients who tested negative. Viral load and host gene expression were assessed by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Bivariate analysis and multiple linear regression were performed to understand the role of nasopharyngeal ACE2 expression in SARS-CoV-2 infection. FINDINGS: Analysis showed no association between age and nasopharyngeal ACE2 transcription in those who tested negative for COVID-19 (P = 0â¢092). Mean relative transcription of transmembrane (P = 0â¢00012) and soluble (P<0â¢0001) ACE2 isoforms, as well as TMPRSS2 (P<0â¢0001) was higher in COVID-19-negative participants than COVID--19 positive ones, yielding a negative correlation between targeted host gene expression and positive COVID-19 diagnosis. In bivariate analysis of COVID-19-positive participants, transcription of transmembrane ACE2 positively correlated with SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA load (B = 0â¢49, R2=0â¢14, P<0â¢0001), transcription of soluble ACE2 negatively correlated (B= -0â¢85, R2= 0â¢26, P<0â¢0001), and no correlation was found with TMPRSS2 transcription (B= -0â¢042, R2=<0â¢10, P = 0â¢69). Multivariable analysis showed that the greatest viral RNA loads were observed in participants with high transmembrane ACE2 transcription (&#914;= 0â¢89, 95%CI: [0â¢59 to 1â¢18]), while transcription of the soluble isoform appears to protect against high viral RNA load in the upper respiratory tract (&#914;= -0â¢099, 95%CI: [-0â¢18 to -0â¢022]). INTERPRETATION: Nasopharyngeal ACE2 transcription plays a dual, contrasting role in SARS-CoV-2 infection of the upper respiratory tract. Transcription of the transmembrane ACE2 isoform positively correlates, while transcription of the soluble isoform negatively correlates with viral RNA load after adjusting for age, biological sex, and transcription of TMPRSS2.

Additional ""checklist-negative"" decedents were randomly tested daily. Lung slides were blindly reviewed by 3 pathologists, assessing for the presence of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and other findings. Sixteen decedents had positive postmortem SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swabs and underwent complete autopsies. Seven decedents had positive screening checklists. Of these, 4 had DAD and 1 had COVID-19-associated thromboembolic disease. Of the 9 decedents with negative screening checklists, 2 had DAD, but only 1 was attributed to COVID-19; the other was likely drug related. Acute bronchopneumonia was the second most common finding, and aspiration was the likely etiology in cases without concomitant DAD. COVID-19-related DAD was identified more commonly in decedents who screened positive by CDC checklist, but false-negatives did occur. Medical examiner offices should maintain a low threshold for random testing of decedents even when COVID-19 is not suspected.","Konopka, Kristine E; Nguyen, Teresa; Hlavaty, Leigh; Rayes, Omar; Schmidt, Carl J; Dahl, Julia; Myers, Jeffrey L",Am J Forensic Med Pathol,,239

Chest imaging revealed diffuse ground glass opacities and he was found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. His hospital course was complicated by sequelae of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) including prolonged mechanical ventilation and renal failure requiring hemodialysis. He never received steroids or other immunosuppressive therapy. After one month, he developed new fevers and thick respiratory secretions. Repeat SARS-CoV-2 PCR at this time was negative. Repeat chest imaging revealed a new right upper lobe cavitary lesion. Differential diagnosis at that time included a developing lung abscess and invasive fungal infection. Tracheal cultures and non-bronchoscopic alveolar lavages were collected and serum galactomannan was sent. Due to ongoing need for mechanical ventilation and persistent secretions, empiric broad spectrum antibiotics and amphotericin B (to include mucormycosis coverage) were started. Cultures initially revealed mold finalized as Aspergillus fumigatus. Antifungal therapy was tailored to voriconazole. His fevers ultimately resolved, and he was weaned to minimal ventilator settings in preparation for tracheostomy. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is a serious infection that can cause severe systemic dysfunction. On imaging, aspergillosis can appear as solitary or multiple pulmonary nodules or masses with a halo, or reverse halo sign. Peripheral areas of consolidation, with or without cavitation, with adjacent pleural thickening and potentially direct invasion into the adjacent chest wall may be seen in advanced cases. Co-infection with aspergillosis in COVID-19 is a newly recognized phenomenon. There is ongoing discussion regarding appropriate evaluation and empiric, perhaps even prophylactic, use of antifungal therapy. Our case was diagnosed after presumed resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection bringing to question the role for routine fungal disease evaluation in so-called recovered individuals with on-going respiratory compromise.","Mascarenhas, E.; Deere, L.

A retrospective cohort study: reply,2021,"BACKGROUND: This study aims to determine the changes in physical activity and actigraphy-measured rest-activity circadian rhythm among Hong Kong community aged population before and during the outbreak of COVID-19. METHODS: This is a three repeated measure population-based cross-sectional study. We recruited community older men aged > 60 years in three periods of the COVID-19 outbreak in Hong Kong, i.e., before the COVID-19 outbreak (2 July 2019-8 January 2020), between the 2nd and 3rd waves of COVID-19 (23 June 2020-9 July 2020), and during the 3rd wave of COVID-19 (15 September 2020-29 September 2020). Participants reported detailed information on their physical activity habits using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire and wore actigraphs continuously for 7 days (168 h). The actigraph data were then transferred to four rest-activity circadian rhythm parameters: midline statistic of rhythm (MESOR), amplitude, acrophase and percent rhythm. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to estimate the association of period effect of COVID-19 on physical activity and rest-activity circadian rhythm parameters. RESULTS: Among the 242 community older men, 106 (43.8%) of them were recruited before the COVID-19 outbreak, 66 (27.3%) were recruited between the 2nd and 3rd waves of COVID-19, and 70 (28.9%) were recruited during the late phase of the 3rd wave of COVID-19. Compared with those recruited before COVID-19, participants recruited between the 2nd and 3rd waves of COVID-19 had lower physical activity (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.03, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) =1.05-3.93), MESOR (AOR = 2.05, 95%CI = 1.01-4.18), and amplitude (AOR = 1.91, 95%CI = 0.95-3.83). There was no difference in physical activity or circadian rhythm parameters between subjects recruited before and during the late phase of the 3rd wave. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that the effect of COVID-19 on physical activity and rest-activity circadian rhythm for the community people may be short-term, indicating strong resilience of the community population. Although maintaining physical activity are encouraged for the older adults to sustain good health, a rebound in their physical activity may be a sign for the next wave of outbreak if insufficient social distancing and population protection are facilitated.","Lee, Priscilla Ming Yi; Huang, Bixia; Liao, Gengze; Chan, Chi Kuen; Tai, Lai-Bun; Tsang, Chun Yuk Jason; Leung, Chi Chiu; Kwan, Mei-Po; Tse, Lap Ah",BMC Public Health,,239

Ceasas are important food distribution centers in Brazil that have great economic importance in Brazilian agribusiness. Scope and approach: In this work, the price of fruits and vegetables sold in four Ceasas in different regions affected by COVID-19 in the first quarter of 2020 were evaluated, with the aim of verifying the possible effects of the pandemic on food supply chains. Data were collected from the institutions' websites and subjected to analysis of variance and Tukey's test (p &#8804; 0.05), principal component analysis and Cluster analysis (Euclidean distance). Key findings and conclusions: The regions affected by COVID-19 showed great variations in the prices of products sold in the studied Ceasas. Statistical analysis showed that food prices were dependent on the regions and the period in which they were traded. In general, the month of March proved to have the greatest impact on the consumer's pocket. The strengthening of Ceasas as platforms for supplying food from short supply chains is essential to guarantee internal food security during crises such as that caused by the new coronavirus.","de Paulo Farias, David; de Araújo, Fábio Fernandes",Trends in food science &amp; technology,,239
321933,PIN46 COVID-19 Patients Analysis Utilizing JAPAN and US Claims Databases,2021,"COVID-19 is a highly infectious disease that has started to creep into African countries including South Sudan. Following confirmation of the first few cases, the government enacted preventive measures to curb community transmission. However, daunting challenges deter these precautionary measures. Just after two years the country took its independence from Sudan, civil conflicts sparked and continue to overburden and undermine the fragile healthcare system. The conflicts have caused disruption of health services, destruction of health facilities, death and migration of health workers, displacements of a huge number of people. This scenario continues while the country is grappling with the pandemic. Other concerning issues include: insufficient COVID-19 testing capacity, limited medical and personal protective equipment and an inadequate number of health workers which leave the country ill-equipped in the battle against the pandemic. Non-compliance of COVID-19 prevention protocols by the general public due to high rate of poverty and social stigma contribute to the spread of the virus. The current situation in South Sudan make evident that there is a need for an immediate ceasefire by the warring sides so the available health services including COVID-19 efforts, are not disrupted to ensure the safety of all. The government needs to further build the capacity of its health sector with the cooperation of its international health allies to be able to provide its citizens with the health services they need.","Dinyo, Daniel Garang Aluk; Ahmadi, Attaullah; Okereke, Melody; Essar, Mohammad Yasir; Lucero-Prisno, Don Eliseo",Pan Afr Med J,,239

The impact of pregnancy as a severity risk factor is still debated, but strict lockdown measures have been recommended for pregnant women. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown on the seroprevalence and circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in a maternity ward in an area that has been significantly affected by the virus. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study at the Antoine Béclère Hospital maternity ward (Paris area, France) from May 4 (one week before the end of lockdown) to May 31, 2020 (three weeks after the end of lockdown). All patients admitted to the delivery room during this period were offered a SARS-CoV-2 serology test as well concomitant SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR on one nasopharyngeal sample. RESULTS: A total of 249 women were included. Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 8%. The RT-PCR positive rate was 0.5%. 47.4% of the SARS-CoV-2-IgG-positive pregnant women never experienced any symptoms. A history of symptoms during the epidemic, such as fever (15.8%), myalgia (36.8%) and anosmia (31.6%), was suggestive of previous infection. CONCLUSIONS: Three weeks after the end of French lockdown, SARS-CoV-2 infections were scarce in our region. A very high proportion of SARS-CoV-2-IgG-negative pregnant women, which is comparable to that of the general population, must be taken into consideration in the event of a resurgence of the pandemic. The traces of a past active circulation of the virus in this fragile population during the spring wave should encourage public health authorities to take specific measures for this independent at-risk group, in order to reduce viral circulation in pregnant patients.","Mattern, Jérémie; Vauloup-Fellous, Christelle; Zakaria, Hoda; Benachi, Alexandra; Carrara, Julie; Letourneau, Alexandra; Bourgeois-Nicolaos, Nadège; De Luca, Daniele; Doucet-Populaire, Florence; Vivanti, Alexandre J",PLoS One,,239

METHODS: This is a prospective study, a total of 145 COVID-19 patients were treated and all discharged according to the guideline criteria by Mar 11th 2020. After discharge, clinical visits and viral RT-PCR tests by the second and fourth week follow-up were carried-out. Patient demographic and clinical characteristics and laboratory data on admission and discharge were retrieved, and predictive factors for SARS-CoV-2 re-positivity were analyzed. RESULTS: 13 out of 145 (9.0%) COVID-19 patients were confirmed re-positivity of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR test. The median interval between disease onset to recurrence was 38 days. SARS-CoV-2 re-positive cases were of significantly longer virus shedding duration, notably higher body temperature, heart rate and lower TNF-alpha and IgG levels on admission. Covariate logistic regression analysis revealed virus shedding duration and IgG levels are independent risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 return positive after discharge. CONCLUSION: Longer viral shedding duration and lower IgG levels are risk factors for re-positivity of SARS-CoV-2 for discharged COVID-19 patients.","Hong, L. X.; Liu, L.; Lin, A.; Yan, W.

The emergence of the novel coronavirus, an increase in microbial resistance, and lack of a vaccine for the present pandemic have made it imperative to appraise the preventive strategies employed during the pre-antibiotic period. Sustainable architecture for children's hospital design and childcare facilities, apart from low energy and carbon emission, must integrate design strategies to confront the impact of infectious diseases. Aim: The aim of the paper is to identify how the space patients and health-care workers0 occupy can be made safer from an architectural design perspective with the view of developing guidelines for policymakers and highlighting the architect's role in combating the pandemic. Objectives: The objectives include; to examine the evolution of medical architecture and the nexus between infectious diseases and architectural space and suggest a design approach that enhances infection prevention and control (IPC). Method: The paper relied on existing literature, interviews, and interactions with healthcare workers. Results/Conclusion: The findings showed that design strategies have always played a significant role in infection prevention and control (IPC) and could as well be a panacea for curbing the spread of Covid -19.","Emmanuel, Udomiaye; Osondu, Eze Desy; Kalu, Kalu Cheche",J Environ Health Sci Eng,,239

326595,"Association Between Nursing Home Crowding and COVID-19 Infection and Mortality in Ontario, Canada",2020,"Inflammation acts like a double-edged sword and can be harmful if not appropriately controlled. COVID-19 is created through a novel species of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV). Elevated levels of inflammatory factors such as interleukin- 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), etc. lead to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and severe complications of infection in the lungs of coronavirus-infected patients. Astaxanthin is a natural and potent carotenoid with powerful antioxidant activity as well as an anti-inflammatory agent that supports good health. The effects of astaxanthin on the regulation of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) pathways and the reduction and suppression of cytokines and other inflammatory agents such as IL-6 and TNF-α have already been identified. Therefore, these unique features can make this natural compound an excellent option to minimize inflammation and its consequences.

328224,"Indian COVID-19 Risk Score, Comorbidities and Mortality",2020,"This study provides a descriptive analysis of the Lègami/Legàmi service, a free psychological support service in maternal and childcare, offered through the internet and by telephone that was initiated by the Italian Society of Pediatric Psychology (S.I.P.Ped.) during the COVID-19 medical emergency as an act of solidarity, first independently, and then in collaboration with the Italian Ministry of Health. This paper presents findings related to the ""universe"" of people who called the toll-free service, from the sociocultural characteristics of the users to the information collected by the professionals during the psychological pathways until human satisfaction was achieved. We provide a retrospective description of an experience that took place between April and June 2020, and which involved users of the maternal-infant area calling from the whole Italy. (1) Methods: The aims of this study were to investigate the configuration of the indicators identified and to detect the possible correlations between them in the sample. There were 193 users who took advantage of the Service, 160 of whom continued beyond the reception service; it is this group that we report the findings from here. The tool used was a form reporting access to care and interventions, and the resulting data underwent a content analysis and the indicators were subject to non-parametric statistical analysis to analyze differences and relationships. (2) Results: There were many correlations among the indicators that revealed a high prevalence of calls due to personal motivations and requests for support, which later allowed users to gain a greater understanding of the underlying problems they were facing. The professionals running the service noticed a prevalence of weaknesses attributable to the negative emotions of its users, alongside a presence of cognitive and relational resources. The professionals' interventions, which can be characterized by a prevalence of social support, psychological rehabilitation, and psychoeducation, achieved outcomes of redefining users' relationships with themselves and others. All of the service's users have expressed a high level of satisfaction with it. (3) Discussion: Our results revealed the protective and transformative effects of the service for its users and the underlying importance of having an easily accessible psychological support system in place during emergencies, like the recent pandemic. In conditions like these, the great value of a remote support service should be noted, and despite its limitations, assures its own efficacy when a medical emergency precludes closer in-person forms of psychological assistance.","Perricone, Giovanna; Rotolo, Ilenia; Beninati, Viviana; Billeci, Nicolò; Ilarda, Valeria; Polizzi, Concetta",Pediatr Rep,,239

This study explored parent's attitudes toward LFH policy based on a survey of 261 participants from 16 provinces in Indonesia. Employing latent class analysis, we revealed three distinct groups of parents with unique compounds of attitudes toward LFH (i.e., disengaged, positive, and negative). Disengaged parents neither consider LFH useful, nor do they see it as demanding. In contrast, the other two groups of parents have quite the opposite views on the usefulness and demandingness of LFH. Further analysis using multinomial logistic regression revealed that older parents from low-income households tend to be disengaged while fathers of young children tend to have negative attitudes toward LFH. Interestingly, the ownership of a personal computer at home seems to be a key indicator of parents with positive attitudes toward LFH after controlling for other demographic factors. How the findings provide a firsthand insight on the existence of digital divide by highlighting the importance of access to personal computers at home is further discussed.","Pratama, Ahmad R; Firmansyah, Firman M",J Child Fam Stud,,239

AIM: To determine how patients are interacting with telephone and online channels for accessing general practice services and information, and to analyse how this varies according to patient characteristics and health status. DESIGN & SETTING: A cross sectional self-administered survey of adult patients in general practices across the West Midlands, UK. METHOD: Descriptive statistics were used to show participants' awareness of and interaction with online information sources and remote access. Multivariable logistic regression was used to model the relationships between demographic and health characteristics and awareness and use of online services and alternatives to face to face consultations (e.g. telephone). RESULTS: 2789 patients (response rate 19.0%) from 43 general practices participated. 60.8% (1651/2715) of participants were aware of online services and 30.3% (811/2674) reported having used one. Daily internet usage and frequently visiting the GP showed the strongest associations with knowledge and use of online services. CONCLUSION: We have shown that there is the potential for inequitable awareness and use of telephone and online services in general practice populations. Given that their use has greatly increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic future service design will need to ensure this is taken into account.","Bryce, Carol; O039,; Connell, Matthew Dl; Dale, Jeremy; Underwood, Martin; Atherton, Helen",,,239

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate imaging findings of MIS-C associated with COVID-19. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Imaging studies and medical records of sixteen patients (0-20 years) admitted with MIS-C were retrospectively reviewed. Thoracic imaging studies were evaluated for parenchymal, mediastinal and hilar, and cardiovascular abnormalities. Abdominal imaging studies were evaluated for abnormalities of solid viscera, hollow viscera, peritoneum, as well as the mesentery and retroperitoneum. Studies were reviewed independently by two radiologists, and disagreements were resolved by a third, senior radiologist. RESULTS: Sixteen patients were included (10 male and 6 female; 20 months - 20 years). All 16 patients presented with fever. Other presenting signs and symptoms included: vomiting (12; 75%), abdominal pain (11; 69%), rash (10;62.5%), conjunctivitis (8;50%), diarrhea (7;44%), headache (6;37.5%), and sore throat (5;31%). Shortness of breath and cough were each present in one patient. Chest radiograph demonstrated cardiomegaly (10; 62.5%), congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema (9; 56%), atelectasis (9; 56%), pleural effusions (7; 44%), adult respiratory distress syndrome (2; 12.5%) and pneumonia (1; 6%). Absolute interobserver agreement was 69-100%. Eight patients (50%) were evaluated for PE (6 [75%] by CT angiography [CTA] and 2 [25%] by ventilation/perfusion scintigraphy). In 2 (25%), CTA demonstrated a segmental PE. Abdominal imaging findings (US and CT) included small volume ascites (6; 38%), hepatomegaly (6; 38%), echogenic kidneys (5; 31%), bowel wall thickening (3; 19%), gallbladder wall thickening (3; 19%), mesenteric lymphadenopathy (2; 13%), splenomegaly (1; 6%), and bladder wall thickening (1; 6%). The frequencies of findings based on all the reviewed modalities were: cardiomegaly (12; 75%), pleural effusion (10; 63%) and atelectasis (10; 63%). 15 patients (94%) were discharged home (length of hospital stay 3-20 days). There were no mortalities. CONCLUSION: MIS-C associated with COVID-19 is characterized predominantly by cardiovascular abnormalities, though also solid visceral organ, gallbladder, and bowel abnormalities as well as ascites, reflecting a multisystemic inflammatory process. CLINICAL IMPACT: The constellation of imaging findings in the setting of COVID-19 may alert pediatric radiologists to the diagnosis of MIS-C prior to rapid deterioration of patients.","Blumfield, Einat; Levin, Terry L; Kurian, Jessica; Lee, Edward Y; Liszewski, Mark C",,,239
332545,Letter to the Editor: Impact of COVID-19 on Neurosurgery and Review of the Literature,2021,"Purpose: The pandemic crisis has resulted in global chaos that had caused massive disruption to the supply chain. The pharmaceutical industry, in particular, has been working tirelessly to ensure that they can cater to the people who need them. With restrictions being imposed to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus, the movement of raw materials required has been affected, thus creating the need for the procurement function to be innovative. This study proposes the application of Industry 4.0 concepts into the procurement activities of an organization to make it more resilient and efficient. Design/methodology/approach: To study the intensity of the challenges, Total Interpretive Structural Modelling is used alongside the “Matrice des Impacts Croises Multiplication Appliquee a un Classement” (MICMAC) technique. Findings: Resilience can be achieved through the collaboration between the organization and its network of suppliers. This is however easier said than done. High and unclear investments have been identified as the challenge that is taking a toll on all technological investments in the pandemic era. The study also shows that organizational inertia which is present in established and structured firms are a deterrent as well. Originality/value: This study is based on the application of procurement 4.0 to ensure that pharmaceutical supply chains stay least affected since they are essentials. This study using a multi-criteria decision-making approach to prioritize the challenges. This will help practitioners make decisions faster. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Joseph Jerome, J.

This study aimed to explore the prevalence of myocardial injury and risk factors for mortality in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. METHOD: Two hundred and twenty-four consecutive patients with confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and definite outcomes (discharge or death) were retrospectively analyzed. Laboratory results including myocardial biomarkers, oxygen saturation, inflammatory indicators and coagulation function were compared between survivors and non-survivors. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression model were used to explore risk factors for in-hospital mortality, and a chart with different combinations of risk factors was constructed to predict mortality. RESULTS: Two hundred and three patients were included in the final analysis, consisting of 145 patients who recovered and 58 patients who died. Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older, with more comorbidities, more severe inflammation and active coagulation function, higher levels of myocardial biomarkers and lower SaO2. 28 (50%) non-survivors and 9 (6%) survivors developed myocardial injury, which was associated with disease severity at admission. Elevated d-dimer (ORâ¯=â¯9.51, 95% CI [3.61-25.0], Pâ¯<â¯0.001), creatinine kinase-myocardial band (ORâ¯=â¯6.93, 95% CI [1.83-26.2], Pâ¯=â¯0.004), Troponin I (ORâ¯=â¯10.1, 95% CI [3.1-32.8], Pâ¯<â¯0.001) and C-reactive protein (ORâ¯=â¯15.1, 95% CI [1.7-129.3], Pâ¯=â¯0.013) were risk factors for mortality. Patients with abnormal levels of d-dimer, Troponin I and CRP were predicted to have significantly higher probability of death. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection may induce myocardial injury and consequently exacerbate the clinical course and worsen prognosis. Abnormal d-dimer, CK-MB, Troponin I and CRP are risk factors for short-term mortality.","Yang, Chongtu; Liu, Fen; Liu, Wei; Cao, Guijuan; Liu, Jiacheng; Huang, Songjiang; Zhu, Muxin; Tu, Chao; Wang, Jianwen; Xiong, Bin",Int. j. cardiol,,239

We describe the rapid planning and deployment of a school-based COVID-19 surveillance system in a metropolitan US county. METHODS: In 2020, we used several data sources to construct disease- and school-based indicators for COVID-19 surveillance in Franklin County, an urban county in central Ohio. We collected, processed, analyzed, and visualized data in the COVID-19 Analytics and Targeted Surveillance System for Schools (CATS). CATS included web-based applications (public and secure versions), automated alerts, and weekly reports for the general public and decision makers, including school administrators, school boards, and local health departments. RESULTS: We deployed a pilot version of CATS in less than 2 months (August-September 2020) and added 21 school districts in central Ohio (15 in Franklin County and 6 outside the county) into CATS during the subsequent months. Public-facing web-based applications provided parents and students with local information for data-informed decision making. We created an algorithm to enable local health departments to precisely identify school districts and school buildings at high risk of an outbreak and active SARS-CoV-2 transmission in school settings. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Piloting a surveillance system with diverse school districts helps scale up to other districts.

339243,The Importance of COVID-19 Testing to Assess Socioeconomic Fatality Drivers and True Case Fatality Rate: Facing the Pandemic or Walking in the Dark?,2021,"This paper endeavors to explain how wind speed can affect the diffusion of COVID-19. The statistical analysis, based on data from Italy, suggests that high wind speed can reduce air pollution commingled with viral agents and as a consequence reduce infected individuals of COVID-19;moreover, results reveal that polluted cities with low wind speed have a greater number of infected individuals and total deaths also because of bad air quality. This study suggests the important role of atmospheric pollution and atmospheric circulation in the transmission dynamics of the novel Coronavirus to support appropriate environmental policy to reduce concentration of pollutants in the atmosphere, improving air quality and human health.","Coccia, Mario",Turkish Economic Review,,239
339609,[Opportunities for use the cascade model of medical care for people living with HIV],2020,"Rapid, sensitive, and specific point-of-care testing for pathogens is crucial for disease control. Lateral flow assays (LFAs) have been employed for nucleic acid detection, but they have limited sensitivity and specificity. Here, we used a fusion of catalytically inactive SpCas9 endonuclease and VirD2 relaxase for sensitive, specific nucleic acid detection by LFA. In this assay, the target nucleic acid is amplified with biotinylated oligos. VirD2-dCas9 specifically binds the target sequence via dCas9 and covalently binds to a FAM-tagged oligonucleotide via VirD2. The biotin label and FAM tag are detected by a commercially available LFA. We coupled this system, named Vigilant (VirD2-dCas9 guided and LFA-coupled nucleic acid test), to reverse transcription-recombinase polymerase amplification to detect SARS-CoV2 in clinical samples. Vigilant exhibited a limit of detection of 2.5 copies/µL, comparable to CRISPR-based systems, and showed no cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV1 or MERS. Vigilant offers an easy-to-use, rapid, cost-effective, and robust detection platform for SARS-CoV2.","Marsic, Tin; Ali, Zahir; Tehseen, Muhammad; Mahas, Ahmed; Hamdan, Samir; Mahfouz, Magdy",Nano Lett,,239
339758,Impact of Diabetes in Patients Diagnosed With COVID-19,2020,"Tips and falls are the most prominent causes of wheelchair accidents that occur when driving on uneven terrains and less accessible environments. The Mobility Enhancement Robotic Wheelchair (MEBot) was designed to improve the stability of Electric Powered Wheelchairs (EPW) when driving over these environments. MEBot offers six independently height-adjustable wheels to control attitude of its seat over uneven and angled terrains. Its attitude control application uses an inertial measurement unit to detect seat angles changes to adjust each wheel-height accordingly. MEBot was compared to commercial EPWs in terms of EPW performance (seat angle changes and response time) and participant perception (satisfaction and task-load demand) towards each device. Ten participants drove their own EPW and MEBot for five trials each through driving tasks that replicated outdoor environments. Results showed less change in the pitch angle when driving up and down a 10° slope using MEBot (5.6 ± 1.6°, 6.6 ± 0.5°) compared to the participants' own EPW (14.6 ± 2.6°, 12.1 ± 2.6°). However, MEBot required 7.8 ± 3.0 s to self-adjust to the minimum angle when driving over the tasks. Participants reported no difference in satisfaction and task load demand between EPWs due to similarities in comfort and ease-of-use. Improving the speed and efficiency of MEBot's attitude control application will be addressed in future work based upon participants' feedback.","Sivakanthan, Sivashankar; Candiotti, Jorge L; Sundaram, S Andrea; Battles, Courtney; Daveler, Brandon J; Chung, Cheng-Shiu; Grindle, Garrett G; Cooper, Rosemarie; Dicianno, Brad E; Cooper, Rory A",Med Eng Phys,,239

The mechanisms of viral particle entry into the cell, viral replication and impact on the immune system and on oxygen transport system are considered. The causes behind complications of the viral infection, such as vasculitis, thrombosis, cytokine storm and lung fibrosis, are discussed. The latest research in the field of small molecule medications to counteract the virus is surveyed. Molecular targets and possible vectors to exploit them are considered. The review is primarily written for specialists who want to understand the chains of activation, replication, action and inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Due to the short period of such studies, the data on complexes of small molecule compounds with possible protein targets are not numerous, but they will be useful in the search and synthesis of new potentially effective drugs.

341686,Predictors of reduced 6-minute walk distance after COVID-19: a cohort study in Mexico,2021,"Objective: In early 2020, Italy struggled with an unprecedented health emergency related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Medical care of chronic neurological diseases, such as epilepsy, is being sorely neglected. In this national survey, we aimed at understanding the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the care of people with epilepsy (PwE) and identifying PwE risk factors for seizure worsening to direct telemedicine efforts. Methods: We administered a 48-items online survey (published on April 11, 2020) including socio-demographic, epilepsy-related, and psychometric variables (BDI-II for depression, GAD-7 for anxiety, and PSQI for sleep) to PwE and people without epilepsy (PwoE). Regression analysis identified predictors of seizure worsening. Results: We collected responses from 456 PwE (344 females) and 472 PwoE (347 females). Outpatient examinations of PwE were postponed in 95% of cases. One-third of PwE complained of issues with epilepsy management, but only 71% of them reached the treating physician and solved their problems. PwE had worse depressive and anxiety symptoms (higher BDI-II and GAD-7 scores; p &lt; 0.001) than PwoE. Sleep quality was equally compromised in both groups (47 and 42%). Sixty-seven PwE (18%) reported seizure worsening, which was best explained by the number of anti-seizure medications (ASM) of chronic therapy and the severity of sleep disorder. Conclusions: During the current COVID-19 pandemic, a significant percentage of PwE experienced difficulties in follow-up and a seizure number increase, in particular those chronically taking more ASMs and with poor sleep quality. This dramatic experience outlines the urgent need for validation and implementation of telemedicine services for epileptic patients in order to provide regular follow-up.","Assenza, Giovanni; Lanzone, Jacopo; Brigo, Francesco; Coppola, Antonietta; Di Gennaro, Giancarlo; Di Lazzaro, Vincenzo; Ricci, Lorenzo; Romigi, Andrea; Tombini, Mario; Mecarelli, Oriano",Front.

341687,Predictors of reduced 6-minute walk distance after COVID-19: a cohort study in Mexico,2021,"In this brief report, we describe the safety of reopening US Olympic and Paralympic Training facilities (USOPTFs) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic from July 2020 through October 2020. We evaluated the prevalence of COVID-19 infection at the time of reentry and cardiopulmonary sequelae of COVID-19 in elite athletes. All athletes returning to a USOPTF were required to go through a reentry protocol consisting of an electronic health history, a 6-day quarantine including twice-daily symptom surveys, COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction and antibody testing, physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, and pulmonary function testing. Athletes with current or prior COVID-19 infection also underwent an echocardiogram, cardiology consultation, and additional testing as indicated. All athletes followed rigorous infection prevention measures and minimized contact with the outside community following reentry. At the time of this report, 301 athletes completed the reentry protocol among which 14 (4.7%) tested positive for active (positive polymerase chain reaction test, n = 3) or prior (positive antibody test, n = 11) COVID-19 infection. During the study period, this cohort accrued 14,916 days living and training at USOPTFs. Only one (0.3%) athlete was subsequently diagnosed with a new COVID-19 infection. No cardiopulmonary pathology attributable to COVID-19 was detected. Our findings suggest that residential elite athlete training facilities can successfully resume activity during the COVID-19 pandemic when strict reentry and infection prevention measures are followed. Dissemination of our reentry quarantine and screening protocols with COVID-19 mitigation measures may assist the global sports and medical community develop best practices for reopening of similar training centers.","Shah, Ankit B; Nabhan, Dustin; Chapman, Robert; Chiampas, George; Drezner, Jonathan; Olin, J Tod; Taylor, David; Finnoff, Jonathan T; Baggish, Aaron L",Sports Health,,239

DESIGN: Multicenter observational cohort study. SETTINGS: Acute medical units in four Italian hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 516 patients (median age 78 years) admitted to the participating centers with SARS-CoV-2 infection from February 22 to May 17, 2020. MEASUREMENTS: Comprehensive medical assessment with detailed history, physical examinations, functional status, laboratory and imaging procedures. On admission, delirium was determined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th edition) criteria, 4AT, m-Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale, or clinical impression depending on the site. The primary outcomes were delirium rates and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Overall, 73 (14.1%, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 11.0-17.3%) patients presented delirium on admission. Factors significantly associated with delirium were dementia (odds ratio, OR = 4.66, 95% CI = 2.03-10.69), the number of chronic diseases (OR = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.03; 1.40), and chest X-ray or CT opacity (OR = 3.29, 95% CI = 1.12-9.64 and 3.35, 95% CI = 1.07-10.47, for multiple or bilateral opacities and single opacity vs no opacity, respectively). There were 148 (33.4%) in-hospital deaths in the no-delirium group and 43 (58.9%) in the delirium group (P-value assessed using the Gray test <.001). As assessed by a multivariable Cox model, patients with delirium on admission showed an almost twofold increased hazard ratio for in-hospital mortality with respect to patients without delirium (hazard ratio = 1.88, 95% CI = 1.25-2.83). CONCLUSION: Delirium is prevalent and associated with in-hospital mortality among older patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Rebora, Paola; Rozzini, Renzo; Bianchetti, Angelo; Blangiardo, Paolo; Marchegiani, Alice; Piazzoli, Andrea; Mazzeo, Francesca; Cesaroni, Giulia; Chizzoli, Anita; Guerini, Fabio; Bonfanti, Paolo; Morandi, Alessandro; Faraci, Bianca; Gentile, Simona; Bna, Claudio; Savelli, Giordano; Citerio, Giuseppe; Valsecchi, Maria Grazia; Mazzola, Paolo; Bellelli, Giuseppe",,,239

The polypeptides can be coupled with corresponding vectors to stimulate the immune system to produce corresponding antibodies, which is also a simple and effective vaccine development method. The discovery of epitopes is helpful to the development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. METHODS: The analyses were related to epitopes on 3 proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E) and membrane (M) proteins, which are located on the lipid envelope of the SARS-CoV-2. Based on the NCBI Reference Sequence: NC_045512.2, the conformational and linear B cell epitopes of the surface protein were predicted separately by various prediction methods. Furthermore, the conservation of the epitopes, the adaptability and other evolutionary characteristics were also analyzed, the sequences of the whole genome of SARS-CoV-2 were obtained from the GISAID. RESULTS: 7 epitopes were predicted, including 6 linear epitopes and 1 conformational epitope. One of the linear and one of the conformational consist of identical sequence, but represent different forms of epitopes. It is worth mentioning that all 6 identified epitopes were conserved in nearly 3500 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, showing that it is helpful to obtain stable and long-acting epitopes under the condition of high frequency of amino acid mutation, which deserved further study at the experiment level. CONCLUSION: The findings would facilitate the vaccine development, had the potential to be directly applied on the prevention in this disease, but also have the potential to prevent the possible threats caused by other types of coronavirus.","Lon, Jerome Rumdon; Bai, Yunmeng; Zhong, Bingxu; Cai, Fuqiang; Du, Hongli",Virol J,,239

353143,Effect OF COVID-19 pandemic on cannabis use in cancer patients,2021,"Social Distancing has proved a necessary measure in controlling the spread of Coronavirus. The CDC (Center for disease control and prevention) in the United States recommends 6 feet as a safe distance between individuals. Therefore, a surveillance system capable of measuring distances between individuals can prove beneficial in limiting the spread. Video surveillance systems have already been introduced in various fields of our daily life to enhance security and protect individuals and sensitive infrastructure. In this work we present a way to use the existing video surveillance infrastructure to measure and monitor social distancing. We present a practical approach to monitor this distance using artificial intelligence and projective geometry techniques. Our approach, after initial setup, works in real-time requiring only a monocular surveillance camera feed. The proposed approach utilizes YOLO v4 neural network object detector for detecting pedestrians in the camera’s view. Projective transformation is used to localize the pedestrians on the ground. Finally, the real world distances between pedestrians is calculated and visualized with the right perspective and occlusion relations as if the distance marks are actually on the ground. All the implementation is in real-time, and is performed on python using the OPENCV libraries and the YOLO v4 neural net with pretrained weights. Experimental results are provided to validate our approach. The code of this work will be made publicly available at GitHub upon acceptance.

355361,Changes to management of a non-pandemic illness during the COVID-19 pandemic: case study of invasive management of acute coronary syndrome,2020,"BACKGROUND: A rapidly increasing number of serological surveys for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 have been reported worldwide. We aimed to synthesise, combine, and assess this large corpus of data. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and five preprint servers for articles published in English between Dec 1, 2019, and Dec 22, 2020. Studies evaluating SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in humans after the first identified case in the area were included. Studies that only reported serological responses among patients with COVID-19, those using known infection status samples, or any animal experiments were all excluded. All data used for analysis were extracted from included papers. Study quality was assessed using a standardised scale. We estimated age-specific, sex-specific, and race-specific seroprevalence by WHO regions and subpopulations with different levels of exposures, and the ratio of serology-identified infections to virologically confirmed cases. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020198253. FINDINGS: 16 506 studies were identified in the initial search, 2523 were assessed for eligibility after removal of duplicates and inappropriate titles and abstracts, and 404 serological studies (representing tests in 5 168 360 individuals) were included in the meta-analysis. In the 82 studies of higher quality, close contacts (18·0%, 95% CI 15·7-20·3) and high-risk health-care workers (17·1%, 9·9-24·4) had higher seroprevalence than did low-risk health-care workers (4·2%, 1·5-6·9) and the general population (8·0%, 6·8-9·2). The heterogeneity between included studies was high, with an overall I2 of 99·9% (p<0·0001). Seroprevalence varied greatly across WHO regions, with the lowest seroprevalence of general populations in the Western Pacific region (1·7%, 95% CI 0·0-5·0). The pooled infection-to-case ratio was similar between the region of the Americas (6·9, 95% CI 2·7-17·3) and the European region (8·4, 6·5-10·7), but higher in India (56·5, 28·5-112·0), the only country in the South-East Asia region with data. INTERPRETATION: Antibody-mediated herd immunity is far from being reached in most settings. Estimates of the ratio of serologically detected infections per virologically confirmed cases across WHO regions can help provide insights into the true proportion of the population infected from routine confirmation data.

355573,Olfactory and taste disorders in COVID-19: a systematic review,2020,"Novel moral norms peculiar to the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in tension between maintaining one's preexisting moral priorities (e.g., loyalty to one's family and human freedoms) and avoiding contraction of the COVID-19 disease and SARS COVID-2 virus. By drawing on moral foundations theory, the current study questioned how the COVID-19 pandemic (or health threat salience in general) affects moral decision making. With two consecutive pilot tests on three different samples (ns &#8776; 40), we prepared our own sets of moral foundation vignettes which were contextualized on three levels of health threats: the COVID-19 threat, the non-COVID-19 health threat, and no threat. We compared the wrongness ratings of those transgressions in the main study (N = 396, M age = 22.47). The results showed that the acceptability of violations increased as the disease threat contextually increased, and the fairness, care, and purity foundations emerged as the most relevant moral concerns in the face of the disease threat. Additionally, participants' general binding moral foundation scores consistently predicted their evaluations of binding morality vignettes independent of the degree of the health threat. However, as the disease threat increased in the scenarios, pre-existing individuating morality scores lost their predictive power for care violations but not for fairness violations. The current findings imply the importance of contextual factors in moral decision making. Accordingly, we conclude that people make implicit cost-benefit analysis in arriving at a moral decision in health threatening contexts.

The presence of the SFTS virus (SFTSV) in companion, livestock, and wild animals has been reported. Recently, human SFTS-like clinical symptoms in cats and cheetahs have been reported in Japan. Therefore, the prevalence of the SFTSV gene or antibody in cats is important for public health as well as veterinary medicine. Materials and Methods: Sera were collected from 201 feral and house cats in the ROK in 2017. Samples were analyzed for the presence of the SFTSV gene after RT-nested PCR amplification and for anti-SFTSV antibodies after enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Results: Eight (4.0%) and nine (4.5%) of 201 cat sera were found to be positive for the SFTSV gene and anti-SFTSV nucleocapsid protein antibodies, respectively. Specifically, 5.9% feral and 2.0% house cats were positive for the SFTSV gene, and 6.9% feral and 2.0% house cats were positive for anti-SFTSV antibodies. All sequences of the SFTSV S segment obtained were included in Japanese/Korean SFTSV clades, as opposed to the Chinese clade. Conclusions: This study constitutes the first serological study of SFTSV in house and feral cats in the ROK. Evidence of SFTSV in companion animals indicates that SFTSV can circulate in homes and that more intensive precautions and education measures are needed for companion animal guardians and veterinarians.","Kang, Jun-Gu; Cho, Yoon-Kyung; Han, Sun-Woo; Jeon, Kyeongseok; Choi, Hooncheol; Kim, Jong-Ho; Cho, Nam-Hyuk; Choi, Kyoung-Seong; Chae, Joon-Seok",,,239

We describe a panel of human mAbs binding to diverse epitopes on the N-terminal domain (NTD) of S protein from SARS-CoV-2 convalescent donors and found a minority of these possessed neutralizing activity. Two mAbs (COV2-2676 and COV2-2489) inhibited infection of authentic SARS-CoV-2 and recombinant VSV/SARS-CoV-2 viruses. We mapped their binding epitopes by alanine-scanning mutagenesis and selection of functional SARS-CoV-2 S neutralization escape variants. Mechanistic studies showed that these antibodies neutralize in part by inhibiting a post-attachment step in the infection cycle. COV2-2676 and COV2-2489 offered protection either as prophylaxis or therapy, and Fc effector functions were required for optimal protection. Thus, natural infection induces a subset of potent NTD-specific mAbs that leverage neutralizing and Fc-mediated activities to protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection using multiple functional attributes.","Suryadevara, Naveenchandra; Shrihari, Swathi; Gilchuk, Pavlo; VanBlargan, Laura A; Binshtein, Elad; Zost, Seth J; Nargi, Rachel S; Sutton, Rachel E; Winkler, Emma S; Chen, Elaine C; Fouch, Mallorie E; Davidson, Edgar; Doranz, Benjamin J; Chen, Rita E; Shi, Pei-Yong; Carnahan, Robert H; Thackray, Larissa B; Diamond, Michael S; Crowe, James E",Cell,,239
358358,"Reply to Jakovac: ""COVID-19 and vitamin D-Is there a link and an opportunity for intervention?""",2020,"Nicotinic receptors are distributed throughout the central and peripheral nervous system. Postmortem studies have reported that some nicotinic receptor subtypes are altered in the brains of autistic people. Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the autistic behavior of BTBR T + tf/J mouse model of autism. This study was undertaken to examine the behavioral effects of targeted nAChRs using pharmacological ligands, including nicotine and mecamylamine in BTBR T + tf/J and C57BL/6J mice in a panel of behavioral tests relating to autism. These behavioral tests included the three-chamber social interaction, self-grooming, marble burying, locomotor activity, and rotarod test. We examined the effect of various oral doses of nicotine (50, 100, and 400 mcg/mL; po) over a period of 2 weeks in BTBR T + tf/J mouse model. The results indicated that the chronic administration of nicotine modulated sociability and repetitive behavior in BTBR T + tf/J mice while no effects observed in C57BL/6J mice. Furthermore, the nonselective nAChR antagonist, mecamylamine, reversed nicotine effects on sociability and increased repetitive behaviors in BTBR T + tf/J mice. Overall, the findings indicate that the pharmacological modulation of nicotinic receptors is involved in modulating core behavioral phenotypes in the BTBR T + tf/J mouse model. LAY SUMMARY: The involvement of brain nicotinic neurotransmission system plays a crucial role in regulating autism-related behavioral features. In addition, the brain of the autistic-like mouse model has a low acetylcholine level. Here, we report that nicotine, at certain doses, improved sociability and reduced repetitive behaviors in a mouse model of autism, implicating the potential therapeutic values of a pharmacological intervention targeting nicotinic receptors for autism therapy.","Mahmood, Hafiz M; Aldhalaan, Hesham M; Alshammari, Tahani K; Alqasem, Mashael A; Alshammari, Musaad A; Albekairi, Norah A; AlSharari, Shakir D",Autism research (Online),,239
358502,Receiver trial interim analysis: Reduction in COPD admissions with digitally supported self-management,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the dependence on digital public service delivery in many nations. The intensified use of digital public services also shifted the spotlight to accessibility and reactive design of digital public services. Inspired by the high level of proactivity provided in commercial digital services, policy-makers are looking for guidance on employing the vast amount of (personal) data available at various public agencies to proactively aid citizens during important life events. Proactivity, however, is a very complex multi-level concept with a myriad of case-specific forms and conditions and is not always desired. Moreover, there is little guidance in the literature on how to classify the level of proactivity and design more proactive public services. The objective of this paper is to provide guidance for classifying, understanding, and designing proactivity. Drawing on previous conceptualizations in literature, this paper introduces a proactivity classification framework that is substantiated using empirical cases from the Netherlands. We found that fully proactive services are not always desired or possible due to public service characteristics. The two key variables in this framework - service eligibility and service delivery - were used to propose design principles for increasing public services' proactivity. The principles were validated and prioritized by four public service innovators. Policy-makers looking to enhance inclusivity through service proactivity can start by classifying current services and integrating the design principles in their innovation roadmap. © 2021 Owner/Author.","Bharosa, N.; Oude Luttighuis, B.; Spoelstra, F.; Van Der Voort, H.; Janssen, M.","22nd Annual International Conference on Digital Government Research: Digital Innovations for Public Values: Inclusive Collaboration and Community, DGO 2021",,239

In this subgroup, if testing 100 000 persons with a SARS-CoV-2 prevalence of 1%, nasopharyngeal swabs would detect 79 more (95% uncertainty interval, 5 fewer to 166 more) persons with SARS-CoV-2 than saliva, but with an incremental cost per additional infection detected of $8093. LIMITATION: The reference standard was imperfect, and saliva collection procedures varied. CONCLUSION: Saliva sampling seems to be a similarly sensitive and less costly alternative that could replace nasopharyngeal swabs for collection of clinical samples for SARS-CoV-2 testing.

Methods: This is a retrospective, multicenter study of ophthalmic, systemic, and genetic features, as collected from medical records of patients diagnosed with infantile nystagmus and foveal hypoplasia. Ophthalmic findings include best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), biomicroscopic examination, cycloplegic refraction, retinal examination, macular optical coherence tomography, and electroretinography. Genetic information was retrieved from the participating genetic clinics and included ethnicity and molecular diagnosis. Results: Thirty-one individuals met the inclusion criteria and had a secure molecular diagnosis. Mutations in two genes predominated, constituting 77.4% of all the represented genes: SLC38A8 (45.1%) and PAX6 (32.3%). Seventy-eight percent of the subjects who had a measurable BCVA had moderate and severe visual impairment (range 20/80 to 20/270). Most patients with a mutation in SLC38A8 had mild to moderate astigmatism, while most patients with PAX6 mutation had moderate and severe myopia. Patients in the PAX6 group had variable degrees of anterior segment manifestations. Conclusion: In our cohort, the main causative genes for congenital nystagmus and foveal hypoplasia in normally pigmented eyes were SLC38A8 and PAX6. A mild phenotype in PAX6 mutations may be an under-diagnosed cause of nystagmus and foveal hypoplasia. Reaching an accurate genetic diagnosis is essential for both the patients and their family members. This enables predicting disease prognosis, tailoring correct follow-up, and providing genetic counseling and family planning to affected families.","Ehrenberg, Miriam; Bagdonite-Bejarano, Laura; Fulton, Anne B; Orenstein, Naama; Yahalom, Claudia",Ophthalmic Genet,,239

Professional courses like nursing has integrated theory with practical learning and due to the lock down situation both aspects of learning-theory as well as the clinical learning are suffering. Though the teaching institutes have come up with the solutions like online lectures, using the video conferencing platform (VCP). This has expanded the horizon of traditional classroom. Though it is widely practiced in developed countries but in India it is still a new trend of learning. Purpose-of this study was to assess learner’s satisfaction level while learning through video conferencing platform and various opportunities and obstacles learner’s faced were explored. Methods – nursing students were the participants and online self-reporting method was adopted for the data collection. Self-developed questionnaire was completed by 138 participants and questionnaire had 36 items to respond on Video Conferencing Platform related to learner’s satisfaction, also opportunities & obstacles encountered while learning through VCP. Results – Majority (63%) of the participants were somewhat satisfied, learning through VCP and 26.1% were highly satisfied. Observation of the opportunities were found to be better learning outcome – brainstorming stimulation, self-motivated learning, able to ask and clear doubts and lecture was reported to be captivating. Another opportunity reported was comfort while learning which included the learning in personal space, no compulsion of physical presence at teaching institute and freedom to choose which lecture to attend. Obstacles reported were related to the classroom environment where the chances avoiding questions and fooling the instructor was reported by majority participants, technical challenges like slow internet disturbed the lecture and made it difficult to articulate lecture and also missed part of lecture. Other obstacles reported were decreased social interaction, participants found learning through VCP to be tiresome as compared to traditional classroom, connectivity issues disturbance create due to the surroundings. Association between the course of study with satisfaction level, opportunities and obstacles were found to be significant, whereas the association between the time spend on VCP was found to be significant only with obstacles.","Jyoti, Sharma K.; Sarin, J.",Indian Journal of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology,,239

Urologists were faced with challenging decisions to stratify their patients into risk groups for assigning the appropriate, safe method of care delivery. Guidelines were swiftly produced by Urological societies to enhance this process but there has been limited uniformity and multiple publications from several institutions. We have conducted this critical review to appraise the current recommendations for providing Urology care during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. The secondary outcome was identifying novel models for care delivery. Results were presented in tables categorising the recommendation by disease and its risk stratification. Results were presented according to the aspect of care: triage for surgery, operative, post-operative and outpatient care. This review reported differing recommendations from Urological societies on the prioritisation of services with limited consideration for individual patient-related factors. Telemedicine has been utilised well during the pandemic to maintain patient pathways. The role of telemedicine in future Urological practice looks promising and more development is required.

We hypothesize that the disparity is significantly smaller in areas with a higher ratio of green spaces. County level data on the SARS-CoV-2 infection rates of black and white individuals in 135 of the most urbanized counties across the United States were collected. The total population in these counties is 132,350,027, comprising 40.3% of the U.S. population. The ratio of green spaces by land-cover type in each county was extracted from satellite imagery. A hierarchical regression analysis measured cross-sectional associations between racial disparity in infection rates and green spaces, after controlling for socioeconomic, demographic, pre-existing chronic disease, and built-up area factors. We found a higher ratio of green spaces at the county level is significantly associated with a lower racial disparity in infection rates. Four types of green space have significant negative associations with the racial disparity in SARS-CoV-2 infection rates. A theoretical model with five core mechanisms and one circumstantial mechanism is presented to interpret the findings.","Lu, Yi; Chen, Long; Liu, Xueming; Yang, Yuwen; Sullivan, William C; Xu, Wenyan; Webster, Chris; Jiang, Bin",Environ Int,,239

METHODS: We performed descriptive clinical follow-up (day (D) 7, D30 and D60) of 150 patients with noncritical COVID-19 confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR at Tours University Hospital from 17 March to 3 June 2020, including demographic, clinical and laboratory data collected from the electronic medical records and by phone call. Persisting symptoms were defined by the presence at D30 or D60 of at least one of the following: weight loss &#8805;5%, severe dyspnoea or asthenia, chest pain, palpitations, anosmia/ageusia, headache, cutaneous signs, arthralgia, myalgia, digestive disorders, fever or sick leave. RESULTS: At D30, 68% (103/150) of patients had at least one symptom; and at D60, 66% (86/130) had symptoms, mainly anosmia/ageusia: 59% (89/150) at symptom onset, 28% (40/150) at D30 and 23% (29/130) at D60. Dyspnoea concerned 36.7% (55/150) patients at D30 and 30% (39/130) at D60. Half of the patients (74/150) at D30 and 40% (52/130) at D60 reported asthenia. Persistent symptoms at D60 were significantly associated with age 40 to 60 years old, hospital admission and abnormal auscultation at symptom onset. At D30, severe COVID-19 and/or dyspnoea at symptom onset were additional factors associated with persistent symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Up to 2 months after symptom onset, two thirds of adults with noncritical COVID-19 had complaints, mainly anosmia/ageusia, dyspnoea or asthenia.

365890,Combining Initial Radiographs and Clinical Variables Improves Deep Learning Prognostication in Patients with COVID-19 from the Emergency Department,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relation between sexual function and depressive symptoms in puerperal women during the pandemic period. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort with 125 women evaluated in the immediate postpartum period (before the pandemic - T1) in Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre, 3 months (pandemic onset - T2) and 6 months (pandemic peak - T3) after birth by email and WhatsApp. The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) were applied. RESULTS: Fifty puerperal women participated in the three periods of the study. The median age was 25 years. There was an inverse correlation between the ââ FSFI and EPDS values at T2 (p < 0.001) and T3 (p < 0.001), demonstrating that the worsening sexual response was secondary to the higher prevalence of depressive symptoms in the puerperium in the COVID-19 pandemic. There was an increase in EPDS scores in the three periods: at T1, the EPDS scores ââwere 5.0 (2.0-9.0), increasing to 7.0 (4.0-14.0) at T2 and 6.5 (3.0-13.0) at T3 (p = 0.004). There was no difference between the FSFI index at the three evaluated times. CONCLUSIONS: Puerperal women are a susceptible subgroup for sexual dysfunction and depressive symptoms, which are correlated to each other and worsen in periods of stress, therefore, it is mandatory to investigate depressive symptoms in puerperal women with sexual complaints, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lorentz, Marcela Siliprandi; Chagas, Luciana Borges; Perez, Amanda Vilaverde; da Silva Cassol, Paulo Antonio; Vettorazzi, Janete; Lubianca, Jaqueline Neves",Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol,,239

METHODS: The ABO phenotype was determined with the tube method. The coding regions of the ABO and FUT1 genes were analyzed by PCR-sequence based typing. The ABO alleles of the proband were determined by allele-specific primer sequencing. The full sequences of the ABO gene of the proband and her mother were determined through next generation sequencing. RESULTS: The red blood cells of the proband did not agglutinate with anti-H, and the sequence of the FUT1 gene was homozygous for c.551_552delAG.The proband was thereby assigned as para-Bombay. Bi-directional sequencing also found that she was heterozygous for c.261G/del,467C>T,c.526C>G,c.657C>T,c.703G>A,c.796C>A,c.803G>C and c.930G>A of the coding regions of the ABO gene. Allele-specific primer sequencing also found her to carry a ABO*A1.02 allele and a recombinant allele from ABO*O.01.01 and ABO*B.01. The recombination site was located between nucleotide c.375-269 and c.526, and the allele was maternally derived. CONCLUSION: An recombinant allele of the ABO gene has been identified, which has originated from recombination of ABO*O.01.01 with the ABO*B.01 allele.","Hong, Xiaozhen; He, Yanmin; Chen, Shu; Chen, Yan; Ying, Yanling; Xu, Xianguo; He, Ji; Zhu, Faming",Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi,,239

Between April 8, 2020, and May 2, 2020, adult students (N = 1,821) across the CUNY system completed an online survey examining COVID-19-related stressors and mental health and sociodemographic factors. Using multivariable logistical regression to assess the association between COVID-19-related stressors and depression and anxiety symptoms, we found a high prevalence and severity of depression and anxiety symptoms. We also observed that more exposure to COVID-19-related stressors was associated with increased depressive (27.0%, 41.4%, and 63.1% for low-, medium-, and high-level stressors, respectively) and anxiety symptoms (19.3%, 34.6%, 52.2%). In addition, the degree of exposure to COVID-19-related stressors served as an important predictor of depression and anxiety symptoms. Compared to high levels of stressors, the odds of depression were 0.2, 95% CI [0.2, 0.3] for low- and 0.4, 95% CI [0.3, 0.5] for medium-level stressors; for anxiety, the odds were 0.2, 95% CI [0.2, 0.3] for low and 0.05, 95% CI [0.4, 0.6] for medium stressors. Finally, household savings of less than $5,000 increased the risk of anxiety but not depression symptoms, OR = 1.3, 95% CI [1.0,1.6].

As a group with a high probability of infection, health workers are faced with a certain degree of psychological challenges in the process of facing the epidemic. This study attempts to evaluate the impact of 2019-nCoV outbreak on the psychological state of Chinese health workers and to explore the influencing factors. During the period from 31 January 2020 to 4 February 2020, the 'Questionnaire Star' electronic questionnaire system was used to collect data. The 2019-nCoV impact questionnaire and The Impact of Event Scale (IES) were used to check the psychological status of health workers in China. A total of 442 valid data were collected in this study. Seventy-four (16.7%) male and 368 (83.3%) female individuals participated in this study. The average score of high arousal dimension was 5.15 (s.d. = 4.71), and the median score was 4.0 (IQR 2.0, 7.0). The average score of IES was 15.26 (s.d. = 11.23), and the median score was 13.5 (IQR 7.0, 21.0). Multiple regression analysis showed that there were critical statistical differences in high arousal scores among different gender groups (male 3.0 vs. female 5.0, P = 0.075). Whether being quarantined had significant statistical differences of IES scores (being quarantined 16.0 vs. not being quarantined 13.0, P = 0.021).

370801,Clinical characterization of obstetric patients with suspected COVID-19,2020,"The antimalarial drug, chloroquine (CQ), and antimicrobial drug, azithromycin (AZM), have received significant attention during the COVID-19 pandemic. Both drugs can alter cardiac electrophysiology and have been associated with drug-induced arrhythmias. Meanwhile, sympathetic activation is commonly observed during systemic inflammation and oxidative stress (e.g., in SARS-CoV-2 infection) and may influence the electrophysiological effects of CQ and AZM. Here, we investigated the effect of beta-adrenergic stimulation on proarrhythmic properties of CQ and AZM using detailed in silico models of ventricular electrophysiology. Concentration-dependent alterations in ion-channel function were incorporated into the Heijman canine and O'Hara-Rudy human ventricular cardiomyocyte models. Single and combined drug effects on action-potential (AP) properties were analyzed using a population of 1,000 models accommodating inter-individual variability. Sympathetic stimulation was simulated by increasing pacing rate and experimentally validated isoproterenol (ISO)-induced changes in ion-channel function. In the canine ventricular model at 1 Hz pacing, therapeutic doses of CQ and AZM (5 and 20 µM, respectively) individually prolonged AP duration (APD) by 33 and 13%. Their combination produced synergistic APD prolongation (+161%) with incidence of proarrhythmic early afterdepolarizations in 53.5% of models. Increasing the pacing frequency to 2 Hz shortened APD and together with 1 µM ISO counteracted the drug-induced APD prolongation. No afterdepolarizations occurred following increased rate and simulated application of ISO. Similarly, CQ and AZM individually prolonged APD by 43 and 29% in the human ventricular cardiomyocyte model, while their combination prolonged APD by 76% without causing early afterdepolarizations. Consistently, 1 µM ISO at 2 Hz pacing counteracted the drug-induced APD prolongation. Increasing the ICa,L window current produced afterdepolarizations, which were exacerbated by ISO. In both models, reduced extracellular K+ reduced the repolarization reserve and increased drug effects. In conclusion, CQ- and AZM-induced proarrhythmia is promoted by conditions with reduced repolarization reserve. Sympathetic stimulation limits drug-induced APD prolongation, suggesting the potential importance of heart rate and autonomic status monitoring in particular conditions (e.g., COVID-19).","Sutanto, Henry; Heijman, Jordi",Front Physiol,,239
371062,"In-depth, single-centre, analysis of changes in emergency service access after the spread of COVID-19 across Italy",2021,"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been reported to disproportionately impact racial/ethnic minorities in the USA, both in terms of infections and deaths. This racial disparity in the COVID-19 outcomes may result from the segregation of minorities in neighborhoods with health-compromising conditions. We, thus, anticipate that neighborhoods would be especially vulnerable to COVID-19 if they are of present-day economic and racial disadvantage and were redlined historically. To test this expectation, we examined the change of both confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths from April to July, 2020, in zip code tabulation areas (ZCTAs) in the New York City using multilevel regression analysis. The results indicate that ZCTAs with a higher proportion of black and Hispanic populations are associated with a higher percentage of COVID-19 infection. Historically low-graded neighborhoods show a higher risk for COVID-19 infection, even for ZCTAs with present-day economic and racial privilege. These associations change over time as the pandemic unfolds. Racial/ethnic minorities are bearing the brunt of the COVID-19 pandemic's health impact. The current evidence shows that the pre-existing social structure in the form of racial residential segregation could be partially responsible for the disparities observed, highlighting an urgent need to stress historical segregation and to build a less segregated and more equal society.","Li, Min; Yuan, Faxi",Race Soc Probl,,239

372355,Perioperative management of patients with hip fractures and COVID-19: A single institution's early experiences,2020,"INTRODUCTION: During the SARS-COV-2 pandemic and consequent government measures to prevent the overwhelming of public hospitals, emergency department (ED) orthopaedic turnout was significantly altered. This study compared the turnout of patients with upper extremity (UE) and hand & wrist (H&W) emergencies during the SARS-COV-2 pandemic, with the same period of 2019, in the public and private sector. MATERIAL-METHODS: Data from a two-month period [March 23, 2020 (application of severe restrictions of civilian circulation) to May 18, 2020 (two weeks after lockdown cessation)] were collected from a public-university hospital and a private hospital and were compared with data from the same ""normal"" period in 2019. RESULTS: During the pandemic, the number of patients with orthopaedic, UE, and H&W problems was significantly reduced by 57.09%, 49.77%, 49.92% respectively (p<0.001) compared to 2019. However, the ratios of UE/total orthopaedic emergencies and of H&W/total orthopaedic emergencies increased significantly during the pandemic from 37.17% to 43.32% and from 25.07% to 29.15% (p=0.006 and p<0.001) respectively, compared to 2019. In the private sector, the turnout was increased for patients with UE problems (8.82%, p=0.67) and H&W problems (24.39%, p=0.3), while in the public sector the turnout was significantly decreased for UE (49.77%, p<0.001) and H&W problems (49.92%, p<0.001) in 2020 compared to 2019. DISCUSSION: The extent of lockdown was unprecedented in recent years. The reduction of orthopaedic, UE and H&W emergencies during lockdown can be attributed to the fear of contracting the virus in the hospitals and even more in hospitals serving as COVID-19 reference centers. Despite the decrease -in absolute numbers- of patients, the increased percentages of UE to total orthopaedic and of H&W to total orthopaedic emergencies in 2020 in both hospitals, reflect the new hobbies' uptake and the increase of domestic accidents during the lockdown, despite overall activity decrease, and underline the necessity of presence of hand surgeons in the EDs. This is one of the very few population-based studies worldwide to show trends in incidence of different injuries of the UE at a regional level during the pandemic, and its results could affect future health care policies.","Fyllos, Apostolos; Varitimidis, Sokratis; Papageorgiou, Fotios; Karamanis, Nikolaos; Alexiou, Konstantinos; Veloni, Aikaterini; Malizos, Konstantinos; Dailiana, Zoe",Injury,,239

Several in vivo and in vitro BE models were developed with questionable translational relevance when implemented separately. Therefore, we aimed to screen Gene Expression Omnibus 2R (GEO2R) databases to establish whether clinical BE molecular profile was comparable with animal and optimized human esophageal squamous cell lines-based in vitro models. The GEO2R tool and selected databases were used to establish human BE molecular profile. BE-specific mRNAs in human esophageal cell lines (Het-1A and EPC2) were determined after one, three and/or six-day treatment with acidified medium (pH 5.0) and/or 50 and 100 µM bile mixture (BM). Wistar rats underwent microsurgical procedures to generate esophagogastroduodenal anastomosis (EGDA) leading to BE.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 1,402 outpatients with diabetes at a clinic in Osaka, Japan, who responded to an interview sheet regarding lifestyle changes during the COVID-19 pandemic between 28 March and 30 May 2020. The association of lifestyle changes with hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and weight changes from February to May 2020 was investigated using the linear regression model. We also investigated the association with clinically important change of HbA1c (by &#8805;0.3%) and bodyweight (by &#8805;3%), using the cumulative link model. RESULTS: Leisure time and other outside physical activities were decreased in one-quarter of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas the amount of meals and snacks was decreased and increased in approximately 10%, respectively. The change in leisure time physical activities was inversely associated with HbA1c and weight changes, whereas the quantitative change of meals with the decline in eating out and that of snacks were positively associated with HbA1c and weight changes (all P < 0.05). The quantitative change of meals without the decline in eating out was also positively associated with weight change (P = 0.012). The cumulative link model for clinically important HbA1c and weight change showed broadly similar associations, except for that between snacks and bodyweight (P = 0.15).

The mean distance travelled for face-to face consultation is 33 Km with a mean total time of 2hours. Most individuals were diagnosed with osteoarthritis/soft tissue rheumatic diseases and/or osteoporosis; 21% had rheumatoid arthritis. The mean length of the TC was 9.64minutes. We find more patient satisfaction with the TC when their level of education is higher (OR=4.12); doctor satisfaction was higher when the individual was better able to manage the Internet (OR=3.01). CONCLUSION: It is possible to transfer rheumatological care activity to TC with a considerable degree of satisfaction for both the patient and the doctor.","Tornero-Molina, Jesús; Sánchez-Alonso, Fernando; Fernández-Prada, Manuel; Bris-Ochaita, María-Luisa; Sifuentes-Giraldo, Alberto; Vidal-Fuentes, Javier",Reumatol. clin.

379125,Impacts of the Coronavirus 2019 Pandemic on Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Volume and Diagnosis of Gastric and Colorectal Cancers: A Population-Based Study,2020,"Nowadays, networks use many different paths to exchange data. However, our research will construct a reliable path in the networks among a huge number of nodes for use in tele-surgery using medical applications such as healthcare tracking applications, including tele-surgery which lead to optimizing medical quality of service (m-QoS) during the COVID-19 situation. Many people could not travel due to the current issues, for fear of spreading the covid-19 virus. Therefore, our paper will provide a very trusted and reliable method of communication between a doctor and his patient so that the latter can do his operation even from a far distance. The communication between the doctor and his/her patient will be monitored by our proposed algorithm to make sure that the data will be received without delay. We test how we can invest buffer space that can be used efficiently to reduce delays between source and destination, avoiding loss of high-priority data packets. The results are presented in three stages. First, we show how to obtain the greatest possible reduction in rate variability when the surgeon begins an operation using live streaming. Second, the proposed algorithm reduces congestion on the determined path used for the online surgery. Third, we have evaluated the affection of optimal smoothing algorithm on the network parameters such as peak-to-mean ratio and delay to optimize m-QoS. We propose a new Smart-Rout Control algorithm (s-RCA) for creating a virtual smart path between source and destination to transfer the required data traffic between them, considering the number of hops and link delay. This provides a reliable connection that can be used in healthcare surgery to guarantee that all instructions are received without any delay, to be executed instantly. This idea can improve m-QoS in distance surgery, with trusted paths. The new s-RCA can be adapted with an existing routing protocol to track the primary path and monitor emergency packets received in node buffers, for direct forwarding via the demand path, with extended features. © 2021 by the authors.

Clinical testing for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly become widespread, but data regarding the interlaboratory performance of these serologic assays are limited. OBJECTIVE.­: To describe the development and initial results of the College of American Pathologists (CAP) SARS-CoV-2 Serology Survey. DESIGN.­: Members from the CAP Microbiology and Diagnostic Immunology and Flow Cytometry Committees formed a working group to support development of a new proficiency testing survey for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays. Supplemental questions in the survey assessed the state of SARS-CoV-2 serologic testing among participating laboratories as of July 2020. Results were analyzed for agreement by immunoglobulin (Ig) isotype tested, assay manufacturer, and methodology. RESULTS.­: A total of 4125 qualitative results were received from 1110 laboratories participating in the first survey. Qualitative agreement for assays measuring anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibodies or IgG was greater than 90% for all 3 samples in the survey. Qualitative agreement for IgM and IgA for the negative sample was greater than 95%, but lacked consensus for the other 2 samples. CONCLUSIONS.­: These initial data suggest overall excellent agreement and comparable performance for most qualitative anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and total antibody assays across all participating clinical laboratories, regardless of specific target antigen or assay methodology.","Tacker, Danyel H; Bashleben, Christine; Long, Thomas C; Theel, Elitza S; Knight, Vijaya; Kadkhoda, Kamran; Rhoads, Daniel D; Linden, Michael A; Fink, Susan L",Arch Pathol Lab Med,,239

379578,An Emergency Surgery in Severe Case Infected by COVID-19 With Perforated Duodenal Bulb Ulcer,2020,"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection presents a significant global public health burden. In 2015, over 400000 deaths worldwide were attributed to HCV infection. This led the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2016 to set the ambitious goal of eliminating HCV by 2030. Adult-centered guidelines have been established in order to provide direction for healthcare professionals, allowing integration of the newest screening policies and therapeutic strategies into their practices. However, for children and adolescents, HCV is a significant, unrecognized public health problem. HCV infection rates in the United States in women of childbearing age and those who are pregnant have increased in parallel with the rising opioid epidemic. An estimated 29000 women with HCV infection gave birth each year from 2011 to 2014 in the United States, with approximately 1700 of their infants being infected with HCV. Newer HCV-specific therapeutics, namely direct acting antivirals (DAA), has brought a new and highly successful approach to treatment of hepatitis C. Recent studies have confirmed similar levels of effectiveness and safety of DAA therapies in the pediatric population. Thus, an enhanced cascade of care, which should include the population under 18 years of age, can help achieve the WHO goal by focusing on elimination in the youngest populations. This review will present an overview of the natural history, clinical features, and management of HCV in children and adolescents.","Rogers, Michael Evan; Balistreri, William F",World J Gastroenterol,,239

However, under-reporting is commonly prevalent in the early stages of an epidemic. In this study, confirmed cases of healthcare workers were considered as accurate small samples to analyze the impact of under-reporting on the spatiotemporal distribution of COVID-19 from three perspectives: parameter estimation, spatiotemporal correlation, and spatiotemporal lag. The results show that (1) the lognormal distribution was the most suitable to describe the evolution of the epidemic with time; (2) the estimated peak infection time of reported cases lagged behind the peak infection time of the healthcare worker cases, and the estimated infection time interval of the reported cases was smaller than that of the healthcare worker cases. (3) The impact of under-reported cases on the early stages of the pandemic was greater than that on its later stages, and the impact on early onset areas was greater than that on late onset areas. (4) Although the number of reported cases was lower than the actual number of cases, a high spatial correlation existed between the cumulatively reported cases and healthcare worker cases.","Wang, Peixiao; Hu, Tao; Liu, Hongqiang; Zhu, Xinyan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.04892v6.pdf,239
381677,Clinical deterioration of Alzheimer's disease patients during the Covid-19 pandemic and caregiver burden,2021,"OBJECTIVES: The assessment of illness severity at admission can contribute to decreased mortality in patients with the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and Quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) scoring systems at admission for the prediction of mortality risk in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We included 140 critically ill COVID-19 patients. Data on demographics, clinical characteristics, and laboratory findings at admission were used to calculate SOFA and qSOFA against the in-hospital outcomes (survival or death) that were ascertained from the medical records. The predictive accuracy of both scoring systems was evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: The area under the ROC curve for SOFA in predicting mortality was 0.890 (95% CI: 0.826-0.955), which was higher than that of qSOFA (0.742, 95% CI 0.657-0.816). An optimal cutoff of &#8805;3 for SOFA had sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 90.00%, 83.18%, 50.00%, and 97.80%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This novel report indicates that SOFA could function as an effective adjunctive risk-stratification tool at admission for critical COVID-19 patients. The performance of qSOFA is accepted but inferior to that of SOFA.","Liu, Sijia; Yao, Ni; Qiu, Yanru; He, Chengqi",Am J Emerg Med,,239

In this study, we shared our experiences on telerehabilitation services established primarily for students with visual disabilities (SwVD) amidst COVID-19 pandemic and its outputs. Methods: Following the lockdown declared on March 23, 2020, the rehabilitative team of a tertiary eye center in north India received information that many visually challenged students (VCS) were stranded in schools for the blind in Delhi, and feeling with anxiety and panic in absence of teachers. Shortly, the room for vision rehabilitation clinic was set-up for telefacilities. The intended services were explained while disseminating the mobile numbers. A semi-structured questionnaire consisting of closed and open-ended was developed to record COVID-19 knowledge and concerns. Inductive content analysis was used to report the qualitative information. Results: As of June 30, 2020, a total of 492 clients contacted the team, with maximum from Delhi (41.5%), and predominantly males (78.8%). Around 80.3% of callers were VCS with age range of 11 to 30 years. The two most frequently encountered health needs were itching in eyes (36.1%) and headache (29%). Television news was the most used medium among callers to get COVID-19 information. Cough is a less frequently known mode of transmission (28%), similarly handwashing as a less known for prevention (17.2%). Eight concerns were recorded based on qualitative data analysis. Conclusion: Telerehabilitation provides valuable insights and has the potential to address various concerns, uncertainty, anxiety, and fear among VCS during the pandemic.","Senjam, Suraj Singh; Manna, Souvik; Vashist, Praveen; Gupta, Vivek; Varughese, Sara; Tandon, Radhika",Indian J Ophthalmol,,239

Existing pattern mining techniques either assume human dynamics is strictly periodic, or require the number of modes as input, or do not consider uncertainty in the sensor data. To handle these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel clustering approach for modeling human behavior (named, MTpattern) from time-series data. For mining frequent human behavior patterns effectively, we utilize a three-stage pipeline: (1) represent time series data into sequence of regularly sampled equal-sized unit time intervals for better analysis, (2) a new distance measure scheme is proposed to cluster similar sequences which can handle temporal variation and uncertainty in the data, and (3) exploit an exemplar-based clustering mechanism and fine-tune its parameters to output minimum number of clusters with given permissible distance constraints and without knowing the number of modes present in the data. Then, the average of all sequences in a cluster is considered as a human behavior pattern. Empirical studies on two real-world datasets and a simulated dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of MTpattern w.r.to internal and external measures of clustering.","Kabra, Rohan; Saxena, Divya; Patel, Dhaval; Cao, Jiannong",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.07549v1.pdf,239

391716,The New York City pandemic resuscitation equitable allocation principles,2020,"Anaerobic digestion technology has been widely used because it has a unique advantage of producing biogas as a renewable energy source. Therefore, several methods were studied to facilitate anaerobic methane production process. Coupling direct voltage and single conductive particles was an effective method to improve anaerobic wastewater treatment efficiency and methane production. However, the enhancement method was limited in this process due to the current of direct voltage or the toxicity of nanoparticles. Therefore, the granular activated carbon loaded with nanoscale zero valent iron (GAC-NZVI) particles prepared by co-precipitation method were added to the anaerobic synthetic wastewater system with direct voltage (0.10 V) to improve the treatment efficiency in this study. GAC-NZVI particles were added into anaerobic system with 0.10 V direct voltage to enhance CH4 production process. The COD removal and total CH4 production were enhanced by 4.22 % and 10.83 % with GAC-NZVI particles. The measurement results of EPS and Fe concentration showed that GAC-NZVI particles promoted the secretion of EPS by microorganisms, which could improve the floc strength of granular sludge. The measurements of conductivity and cyclic voltammetry (CV) showed that particles accelerated the metabolism of microorganism and promoted the electron transfer process. The increasing of Methanothrix and Methanobacterium could strengthen the methanogenesis. The abundances of bacteria and archaea using indirect interspecies electron exchange form (such as H2 or formate transfer microorganisms) were decreased after adding the particles. The results indicated that anaerobic treatment efficiency could be enhanced under the combined action of direct voltage and particles.","Sun, Muchen; Jiang, Hongxuan; Zhang, Zhaohan; Lv, Miao; Liu, Guohong; Feng, Yujie",Chemosphere,,239

The associated bleeding risk remains unknown. We investigated major bleeding complications in ICU COVID-19 patients and we examined their relationship with inflammation and thromboprophylaxis. Retrospective monocentric study of consecutive adult patients admitted in ICU for COVID-19 pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation. Data collected included demographics, anticoagulation status, coagulation tests and outcomes including major bleeding and thrombotic events. Among 56 ICU COVID-19 patients, 10 (18%) patients had major bleeding and 16 (29%) thrombotic events. Major bleeding occurred later than thrombosis after ICU admission [17(14-23) days versus 9(3-11) days respectively (p = 0.005)]. Fibrinogen concentration always decreased several days [4(3-5) days] before bleeding; D-dimers followed the same trend. All bleeding patients were treated with anticoagulants and anticoagulation was overdosed for 6 (60%) patients on the day of bleeding or the day before. In the whole cohort, overdose was measured in 22 and 78% of patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation during fibrinogen increase and decrease respectively (p < 0.05). Coagulation disorders had biphasic evolution during COVID-19: first thrombotic events during initial hyperinflammation, then bleeding events once inflammation reduced, as confirmed by fibrinogen and D-dimers decrease. Most bleeding events complicated heparin overdose, promoted by inflammation decrease, suggesting to carefully monitor heparin during COVID-19. Thromboprophylaxis may be adapted to this biphasic evolution, with initial high doses reduced to standard doses once the high thrombotic risk period ends and fibrinogen decreases, to prevent bleeding events.","Godier, Anne; Clausse, Darless; Meslin, Simon; Bazine, Myriame; Lang, Elodie; Huche, Florian; Cholley, Bernard; Hamada, Sophie Rym",J. thromb. thrombolysis,,239

A Single Center Study in Kigali, Rwanda",2020,"PURPOSE: In the current COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important than ever to maximize communication in the scientific and medical community. In the context of academic meetings and conferences, there is the growing need for a set of guidelines secondary to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the growing environmental and economic challenges that large academic and medical conferences face. These Virtual Meetings Best Practices were established in response to the scant evidence and guidance on the topic. METHODS: These best practice guidelines were developed from a scoping review of peer-reviewed literature, grey literature and lay literature. MEDLINE and Embase databases were scoped for relevant, non-duplicate articles. For lay articles, Google searches were utilized. The recommendations that comprise this document are a compilation of nonexperimental descriptive studies (e.g. case studies) and expert committee reports, opinions and/or experience of respected authorities, and lay articles. RESULTS: We identified four phases of the meeting cycle: Pre-planning considerations, Planning, Accomplishing conference goals through execution, gauging Response and Engaging the target audience for future cycles (PrePARE). Akin to the Plan, Do, Study, Act Cycle of quality improvement interventions, this document is meant to drive meaningful initial and subsequent interventions in the meetings of the medical and academic community. This covers actions and preparation for registration, scheduling, speakers, attendees, event type, technology, monetization/marketing, dealing with disruptions, post-event deliverables, response and engagement strategies. Enhanced access to integrated, high-quality and efficient virtual meetings will establish a new norm as an effective alternative for innovative health research, education and information dissemination in orthopaedics and beyond. CONCLUSIONS: Given the uncertainty of whether large in-person gatherings will be permitted, advisable or responsible later into the summer of 2020 and beyond, these guidelines will aid events being converted and scheduled as virtual-only meetings. As we move forward in the era of increased utility and utilization of virtual conferencing, these guidelines will serve as a benchmark and standard for surgeons in the field.","Rubinger, Luc; Gazendam, Aaron; Ekhtiari, Seper; Nucci, Nicholas; Payne, Abbey; Johal, Herman; Khanduja, Vikas; Bhandari, Mohit",Int Orthop,,239

394562,Impact of the COVID-19 Epidemic on a Pan-Asian Academic Oncology Clinical Trial,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global pandemic. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is the key component of the replication or transcription machinery of coronavirus. Therefore SARS-CoV-2-RdRp has been chosen as an important target for the development of antiviral drug(s). During the early pandemic of the COVID-19, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were suggested by the researchers for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2. In our study, the antimalarial compounds have been screened and docked against SARS-CoV-2-RdRp (PDB ID: 7BTF), and it was observed that the antimalarials chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and amodiaquine exhibit good affinity. Since the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2-RdRp with its substrate is not available, poliovirus-RdRp crystal structure co-crystallized with its substrate ATP (PDB ID: 2ILY) was used as a reference structure. The superimposition of SARS-CoV-2-RdRp and poliovirus-RdRp structures showed that the active sites of both of the RdRps superimposed very well. The amino acid residues involved in the binding of ATP in the case of poliovirus-RdRp and residues involved in binding with the antimalarial compounds with SARS-CoV-2-RdRp were compared. In both cases, the conserved residues were found to be involved in establishing the interactions. The MMGBSA and molecular dynamic simulation studies were performed to strengthen our docking results. Further residues involved in binding of antimalarials with SARS-CoV-2-RdRp were compared with the residues involved in the SARS-CoV-2-RdRp complexed with remdesivir [PDB ID: 7BV2]. It was observed that co-crystallized remdesivir and docked antimalarials bind in the same pocket of SARS-CoV-2 -RdRp. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

The nsp14 protein of SARS-CoV-2 houses a 3' to 5' exoribonuclease activity responsible for removing mismatches that arise during genome duplication. A homology model of nsp10-nsp14 complex was used to carry out in silico screening to identify molecules among natural products, or FDA approved drugs that can potentially inhibit the activity of nsp14. This exercise showed that ritonavir might bind to the exoribonuclease active site of the nsp14 protein. A model of the SARS-CoV-2-nsp10-nsp14 complex bound to substrate RNA showed that the ritonavir binding site overlaps with that of the 3' nucleotide of substrate RNA. A comparison of the calculated energies of binding for RNA and ritonavir suggested that the drug may bind to the active site of nsp14 with significant affinity. It is, therefore, possible that ritonavir may prevent association with substrate RNA and thus inhibit the exoribonuclease activity of nsp14. Overall, our computational studies suggest that ritonavir may serve as an effective inhibitor of the nsp14 protein. nsp14 is known to attenuate the inhibitory effect of drugs that function through premature termination of viral genome replication. Hence, ritonavir may potentiate the therapeutic properties of drugs such as remdesivir, favipiravir and ribavirin.","Narayanan, Naveen; Nair, Deepak T",Int J Biol Macromol,,239

Specifically, we characterize the impact of network noise on the bias and variance of the observed branching factor for arbitrary true networks, with examples in sparse, dense, homogeneous and inhomogeneous networks. In addition, we propose two estimators, by method-of-moments and bootstrap sampling.

The epidemiological conditions and consequent measures have affected the treatment of patients enrolled in specialized palliative care. Methods: This study collected data on the number and type of treatments for cancer patients included in acute palliative care at the Institute of Oncology Ljubljana (OI) and provided observations on the covid-19 outbreak compared to pre-epidemic data. Results: In 2020, we recorded 25% more referrals than in 2019.The average length of stay decreased from 6.2 days to 5.1 days. The average number of family meetings in the period before covid-19 was 148 but last year it was 214. There is a statistically significant relationship between the calendar year and dismissals or deaths. In 2020, statistically significantly more people died at OAPO than expected (p &lt;0.05, with the value = 2.76), statistically significantly fewer people than would be expected were transferred to hospices (p &lt;0.05, with the value = -2.01) and elsewhere (p &lt;0.05, with the value = -2.56). In 2020, 22% of outpatient examinations were performed more than the average of the previous years.The pandemic has had and continues to have implications for the conduct of specialized palliative care treatments. Conclusion: Care for cancer patients and palliative care was limited during covid-19. This has led to significant challenges in providing palliative care. The crisis model of palliative care organization was more or less focused on caring for the dying.

Researchers and policymakers are striving to understand the impact of these policies on a variety of outcomes. Policy impact evaluations always require a complex combination of circumstance, study design, data, statistics, and analysis. Beyond the issues that are faced for any policy, evaluation of COVID-19 policies is complicated by additional challenges related to infectious disease dynamics and lags, lack of direct observation of key outcomes, and a multiplicity of interventions occurring on an accelerated time scale. In this paper, we (1) introduce the basic suite of policy impact evaluation designs for observational data, including cross-sectional analyses, pre/post, interrupted time-series, and difference-in-differences analysis, (2) demonstrate key ways in which the requirements and assumptions underlying these designs are often violated in the context of COVID-19, and (3) provide decision-makers and reviewers a conceptual and graphical guide to identifying these key violations. The overall goal of this paper is to help policy-makers, journal editors, journalists, researchers, and other research consumers understand and weigh the strengths and limitations of evidence that is essential to decision-making.","Haber, Noah A; Clarke-Deelder, Emma; Salomon, Joshua A; Feller, Avi; Stuart, Elizabeth A",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.01940v2.pdf,239

Several plant extracts act as antioxidant agents against wide-range of pesticide toxicity hazards through the free radicals scavenging properties. Plants' secondary metabolites are considered as efficient protective agents against various cellular toxic injuries. Understanding these properties of botanicals, several researchers currently focused on the detoxification and ameliorative potency of plant extracts against highly toxic chemicals. In our studies, we focused on the endosulfan total and its isomers (alpha and beta) induced changes on Drosophila melanogaster and their ameliorative effects by co-administrated with methanolic and aqueous extracts of Catharanthus roseus whole plant. We selected the 1/5th EC50 concentration of alpha-endosulfan, beta-endosulfan, and endosulfan (total) and co-administrated with 1/50th EC50 concentration of aqueous and methanolic extracts and evaluated their ameliorative effects, in terms of verifying the life stage activities, protein profiling and also by using live brain cells imaging. We finally concluded that, the methanolic and aqueous extracts inhibit the toxic impacts caused by endosulfan and its isomers and also increasing the survival rate of the test organism.","Shameema, K; Anand, P P; Vardhanan, Y Shibu",Comp Biochem Physiol C Toxicol Pharmacol,,239

The topic of discussion may be the physician who ""fights"" (the ""hero physician""), the contaminated professional, the doctor who refuses to treat or the resigning physician. This may increase potential conflicts between the physicians' individual values and those of their patients, conflicts that can have personal and social consequences. Doctors implicitly assume that treating patients may generate risks for his/her own well-being, but none should accept risks related to insufficient protective equipment or inappropriate protocols, or other external causes that unjustifiably increase them. Everybody involved in healthcare has the duty to minimize the risks imposed on the patient; otherwise not only physicians are at risk, but also patients and society, which could receive less healthcare or even develop other diseases.","Isaila, Oana-Maria; Hostiuc, Sorin",Rev. bioét.

The purpose of the current study is to investigate the associations between COVID-19 incidences and hydrological factors such as lake area, river length, precipitation and volume of water resources in 30 regions of China. All confirmed cases for each areas were divided into two clusters including first cases cluster driven by imported cases during the period of January 20th to January 29th, 2020 and second cases cluster driven by local cases during the period of January 30th to March 1st, 2020. Based on the results of descriptive analysis and nonlinear regression analysis, positive associations with COVID-19 confirmed numbers were observed for migration scale index (MSI), river length, precipitation and volume of water resources, but negative associations for population density. The correlation coefficient in the second stage cases cluster is apparently higher than that in the first stage cases cluster. Then, the negative binomial-generalized linear model (NB-GLM) was fitted to estimate area-specific effects of hydrological variables on relative risk (RR) with the incorporation of additional variables (e.g., MSI) and the effects of exposure-lag-response. The statistically significant associations between RR and river length, the volume of water resources, precipitation were obtained by meta-analysis as 1.24 (95% CI: 1.22, 1.27), 2.56 (95% CI: 2.50, 2.61) and 1.59 (95% CI: 1.56, 1.62), respectively. The possible water transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 and the potential capacity of long-distance transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in water environment was also discussed. Our results could provide a better guidance for local and global authorities to broaden the mind for understanding the natural-social system or intervening measures for COVID-19 control at the current or futural stage.","Wang, Jingquan; Li, Wei; Yang, Bo; Cheng, Xin; Tian, Zixin; Guo, Hongguang",Environ Res,,239

409092,COVID-19 and Multiorgan Response,2020,"Crystals, nanoparticles, and fibrils catalyze the generation of new aggregates on their surface from the same type of monomeric building blocks as the parent assemblies. This secondary nucleation process can be many orders of magnitude faster than primary nucleation. In the case of amyloid fibrils associated with Alzheimer's disease, this process leads to the multiplication and propagation of aggregates, whereby short-lived oligomeric intermediates cause neurotoxicity. Understanding the catalytic activity is a fundamental goal in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of Alzheimer's and associated diseases. Here we explore the role of fibril structure and hydrophobicity by asking whether the V18, A21, V40, and A42 side chains which are exposed on the Aß42 fibril surface as continuous hydrophobic patches play a role in secondary nucleation. Single, double, and quadruple serine substitutions were made. Kinetic analyses of aggregation data at multiple monomer concentrations reveal that all seven mutants retain the dominance of secondary nucleation as the main mechanism of fibril proliferation. This finding highlights the generality of secondary nucleation and its independence of the detailed molecular structure. Cryo-electron micrographs reveal that the V18S substitution causes fibrils to adopt a distinct morphology with longer twist distance than variants lacking this substitution. Self- and cross-seeding data show that surface catalysis is only efficient between peptides of identical morphology, indicating a templating role of secondary nucleation with structural conversion at the fibril surface. Our findings thus provide clear evidence that the propagation of amyloid fibril strains is possible even in systems dominated by secondary nucleation rather than fragmentation.","Thacker, Dev; Sanagavarapu, Kalyani; Frohm, Birgitta; Meisl, Georg; Knowles, Tuomas P J; Linse, Sara",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,,239

Owing to the rapid spread, almost 22 million people became infected and 700,000 died. Similar to other countries, the need for additional hospital beds and intensive care units required diversion of health care resources toward the care for those with COVID-19 in Turkey. Telemedicine appeared as a safe and low-cost alternative for the maintainability of pediatric health services during the pandemics. Within this context, we aimed to deliver the health services through telemedicine during the follow-up of chronic childhood diseases. Materials and Methods: This prospective study included five pediatric subspecialties, including allergy immunology, hematology and oncology, nephrology, rheumatology, and inborn metabolic disorders. After the interview, patients and involved physicians were requested to fill out a questionnaire designed to measure the level of satisfaction and the quality of the service we offered. Results: Of the 263 interviews, overall patient and physician satisfaction was 99% and 87%, respectively. As results of the interviews, 250 routine visits were performed, 181 acute complaints were assessed, drug changes were made in 118 patients, 9 patients were determined to be unable to get their drugs, and 12 who misused their drugs. The main advantage of the telemedicine declared by the patients was ""not to waste time for transportation."" The main concerns of the participants were inability to perform physical and laboratory examinations.

Emerging studies indicate possible associations between viral infections and neurodegenerative and neurobehavioural conditions including autism. Viral infection during critical periods of early in utero neurodevelopment may lead to increased risk of autism in the offspring. This review is aimed at highlighting the association between viral infections, including viruses similar to COVID-19, and the aetiology of autism. A literature search was conducted using Pubmed, Ovid/Medline, and Google Scholar database. Relevant search terms included ""rubella and autism"", ""cytomegalovirus and autism"", ""influenza virus and autism"", ""Zika virus and autism"", ""COVID-19 and autism"". Based on the search terms, a total of 141 articles were obtained and studies on infants or children with congenital or perinatal viral infection and autistic behaviour were evaluated. The possible mechanisms by which viral infections could lead to autism include direct teratogenic effects and indirect effects of inflammation or maternal immune activation on the developing brain. Brain imaging studies have shown that the ensuing immune response from these viral infections could lead to disruption of the development of brain regions and structures. Hence, long-term follow up is necessary for infants whose mothers report an inflammatory event due to viral infection at any time during pregnancy to monitor for signs of autism. Research into the role of viral infection in the development of ASD may be one avenue of improving ASD outcomes in the future. Early screening and diagnosis to detect, and maybe even prevent ASD are essential to reduce the burden of this condition.","Shuid, Ahmad Naqib; Jayusman, Putri Ayu; Shuid, Nazrun; Ismail, Juriza; Kamal Nor, Norazlin; Mohamed, Isa Naina",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,239

414582,Excess Cardiac Arrest in the Community During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, the downregulation of all elective interventions during the period from 15 March 2020 to 15 May 2020 in Germany led to a decrease in operations. The impact on the number of specific operations in visceral surgery is so far unknown. METHODS: This retrospective study included 301 patients who underwent a cholecystectomy or appendectomy at a university hospital or a primary care facility between 15 March 2020 and 15 May 2020 (vs. 2018 and 2019). The number of cases and the clinical outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: The suspension of elective surgery resulted in a significant reduction in elective cholecystectomy and emergency appendectomy. At the University Hospital the number of appendectomies decreased by 33% from 24 in 2018 to 16 in 2020 and the number of cholecystectomies declined by 57% from 30 in 2018 to 13 in 2020. At the primary care hospital, the number of appendectomy patients decreased by 48% from 23 in 2018 to 12 in 2020 and the number of cholecystectomies increased from the year 2018 to 2019 and subsequently declined by 30% in 2020. The duration of surgery, length of hospital stay and clinical course of patients did not significantly differ from the previous year time periods. CONCLUSIONS: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, the lockdown resulted in a significant reduction in frequently carried out visceral surgical interventions. In order to maintain the optimal medical care for the total population, current options for surgical and conservative treatment must be weighed against each other depending on the numbers of local infections and the individual comorbidities of the patients.","Steffani, Marcella; Merz, Constanze; Stöß, Christian; Landau, Lars; Hüser, Norbert; Hartmann, Daniel; Friess, Helmut; Theisen, Jörg; Novotny, Alexander",Chirurg,,239

Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and hospitalized at Toyama University Hospital were included in the analysis. Nasopharyngeal viral load was measured when symptom-based criteria for discharge or end of isolation in the accommodations were met, and examined the relationship between viral load and days after onset or age. From the perspective of virus isolation limit, the amount of infectious viral load was defined at 50 copies/µL by nasopharyngeal sample. Thirty-three patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were included in the analysis, after excluding critical and fatal cases. Mean nasopharyngeal viral load at discharge or end of isolation was 1.90 log-copies/µL, and 64% of patients were discharged with over 50 copies/µL. No correlation was apparent between age and viral load at discharge, and viral load remained relatively high at discharge or end of isolation in all age groups. Although attempts at infectious virus isolation are necessary, infection control precautions even after discharge or discontinued isolation in accommodations may be needed, as the date of onset mostly depended on self-reporting by patients.","Fukui, Yasutaka; Kawasuji, Hitoshi; Taekgoshi, Yusuke; Kaneda, Makito; Murai, Yushi; Kimoto, Kou; Ueno, Akitoshi; Miyajima, Yuki; Kawago, Koyomi; Sakamaki, Ippei; Morinaga, Yoshitomo; Yamamoto, Yoshihiro",J. infect. chemother,,239

The paper provides key considerations for those building a (business) case for clinical ethics support within hospitals by drawing upon published academic literature, and key reports from governmental and professional bodies. We also include extracts from documents relating to, and annual reports of, existing clinical ethics support within UK hospitals, as well as extracts from our own proposal submitted to the Trust Board. We aim for this paper to support other ethicists and/or health care staff contemplating introducing clinical ethics support into hospitals, to facilitate the process of making the case for clinical ethics support, and to contribute to the key debates in the literature around clinical ethics support. We conclude that there is a real need for investment in clinical ethics in the UK in order to build the evidence base required to support the wider introduction of clinical ethics support into UK hospitals. Furthermore, our perceptions of the purpose of, and perceived needs met through, clinical ethics support needs to shift to one of hospitals investing in their staff. Finally, we raise concerns over the optional nature of clinical ethics support available to practitioners within UK hospitals.","Machin, L L; Wilkinson, Mark",HEC forum,,239

We aimed to evaluate the service as a tool for avoiding face-to-face consultations, describe the main conditions diagnosed, and assess levels of patient and physician satisfaction. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Prospective descriptive study of new patients who met the inclusion criteria. Descriptive statistics for all variables were analyzed with SPSS. RESULTS: Of the 1,497 patients who agreed to participate in the study, 25% (n=374) sent an image to a consultant dermatologist through the mobile application. Sixty-four patients (17%) were discharged directly and referred to primary care for follow-up. A face-to-face consultation was avoided for at least 3 months in 85% of patients (n=318); 87.1% (n=325) received a diagnosis and the dermatologist's level of confidence in this diagnosis was 7 or higher in 77.5% of cases (n=290). The quality of the images sent was considered sufficient in 52.1% of cases. Patients rated their satisfaction with a score of 4.5 out of 5. Eleven of the 16 dermatologists rated their satisfaction as good overall. The most common conditions were inflammatory and melanocytic lesions. The main diagnoses were nevi, acne, and eczema. DISCUSSION: Direct-to-patient store-and-forward teledermatology is an effective means of evaluating new patients. Both clinicians and patients expressed high levels of satisfaction with the service. Systems enabling the addition of digital images to patient records are necessary to ensure the efficiency of teledermatology.","Sendagorta, E; Servera, G; Nuño, A; Gil, R; Pérez-España, L; Herranz, P",Actas dermo-sifiliogr.

425536,Letter to the Editor: Role of Morality in Critical Care in COVID-19 Times,2021,"Summary: We report the case of a 65-year-old female who presented with symptomatic hypercalcaemia (corrected calcium of 4.57 mmol/L) with confusion, myalgias and abdominal discomfort. She had a concomitant metabolic alkalosis (pH 7.46, HCO3- 40 mmol/L, pCO2 54.6 mmHg). A history of significant Quick-Eze use (a calcium carbonate based antacid) for abdominal discomfort, for 2 weeks prior to presentation, suggested a diagnosis of milk-alkali syndrome (MAS). Further investigations did not demonstrate malignancy or primary hyperparathyroidism. Following management with i.v. fluid rehydration and a single dose of i.v. bisphosphonate, she developed symptomatic hypocalcaemia requiring oral and parenteral calcium replacement. She was discharged from the hospital with stable biochemistry on follow-up. This case demonstrates the importance of a detailed history in the diagnosis of severe hypercalcaemia, with MAS representing the third most common cause of hypercalcaemia. We discuss its pathophysiology and clinical importance, which can often present with severe hypercalcaemia that can respond precipitously to calcium-lowering therapy. Learning points: Milk-alkali syndrome is an often unrecognised cause for hypercalcaemia, but is the third most common cause of admission for hypercalcaemia. Calcium ingestion leading to MAS can occur at intakes as low as 1.0-1.5 g per day in those with risk factors. Early recognition of this syndrome can avoid the use of calcium-lowering therapy such as bisphosphonates which can precipitate hypocalcaemia.","Wang, Mawson; Cho, Catherine; Gray, Callum; Chai, Thora Y; Daud, Ruhaida; Luttrell, Matthew",,,239

SARS-CoV-2 patient samples (n = 43) were analyzed alongside pre-pandemic control specimen (n = 50), confirmed respiratory infections (n = 50), inflammatory polyarthritis (n = 22) and positive for thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin (n = 30). Imprecision, diagnostic sensitivity and specificity and concordance were evaluated on IgG serologic assays from EuroImmun, Epitope Diagnostics (EDI), Abbott Diagnostics and DiaSorin and a rapid IgG/IgM test from Healgen. EDI and EuroImmun imprecision was 0.02-14.0% CV. Abbott and DiaSorin imprecision (CV) ranged from 5.2%-8.1% and 8.2%-9.6% respectively. Diagnostic sensitivity of the assays was 100% (CI: 80-100%) for Abbott, EDI and EuroImmun and 95% (CI: 73-100%) for DiaSorin at &#8805;14 days post PCR. Only the Abbott assay had a diagnostic specificity of 100% (CI: 91-100%). EuroImmun cross-reacted in 3 non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infections and 2 controls. The DiaSorin displayed more false negative results and cross-reacted in six cases across all conditions tested. EDI had one cross-reactive sample. The Healgen rapid test showed excellent sensitivity and specificity. Overall, concordance of the assays ranged from 76.1% to 97.9%. Serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 showed good analytical performance. The head-to-head analysis of samples revealed differences in results that may be linked to the use of nucleocapsid or spike proteins. The point of care device tested demonstrated adequate performance for antibody detection.","Piec, Isabelle; English, Emma; Thomas, Mary Annette; Dervisevic, Samir; Fraser, William D; John, William Garry",PLoS One,,239

Considering the worldwide cases of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), it remains a pandemic and the vaccines and therapeutic agents have yet to be developed to stop the spread of this outbreak. Due to the unavailability of specific treatment for the COVID-19, it can be viewed that the risk of cluster infection will continue to be present within the intermittent and small-scale outbreaks. Though the COVID-19 has been identified as a communicable disease, the preventive measures and response policies in South Korea are effectively serving the purpose and gained the confidence to overcome the COVID-19 crisis. This paper includes the exploratory data analysis of COVID-19 cases in South Korea till July 8, 2020. South Korea has reported the lowest death rate with the majority of the deaths, associated with persons with underlying health conditions or elderly infected individuals. Currently the infected patients (total 989) remaining in South Korea are mild cases owing to its robust health care system and quarantine inspection procedures followed by the Ministry of Health and Welfare of South Korea to flatten the COVID-19 curve. Although the COVID-19 countermeasures taken by the South Korean government may not be conclusive or universal for all, but its exemplary approach to tackle COVID-19 can aid countries across the globe to strengthen their response system for the future outbreak of such an infectious disease.","Arora, Amarpreet Singh; Rajput, Himadri; Changotra, Rahil",Environ Dev Sustain,,239

We evaluated whether the rate of severe presentations of new onset type 1 diabetes (DM1), such as, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) has changed since the COVID-19 public health measures were enacted. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review of children less than 18 years of age presenting with new onset DM1 during the pandemic period of March 17, 2020 to August 31, 2020 was conducted at two tertiary care pediatric hospitals in Alberta, Canada. Rates of DKA and severe DKA were compared to the same time period in the year 2019 (pre-pandemic control). RESULTS: The number of children presenting with newly diagnosed DM1 was similar during the pandemic year of 2020 compared with 2019 (107 children in 2020 vs. 114 in 2019). The frequency of DKA at DM1 onset was significantly higher in the pandemic period (68.2% vs 45.6%; p < 0.001) and incidence of severe DKA was also higher (27.1% in 2020 vs 13.2% in 2019; p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant increase in DKA and severe DKA in children presenting with new onset DM1 during the COVID-19 pandemic period. This emphasizes the need for educating health care professionals and families to be aware of the symptoms of hyperglycemia and the importance of early diagnosis and treatment even during public health measures for COVID-19.","Ho, Josephine; Rosolowsky, Elizabeth; Pacaud, Daniele; Huang, Carol; Lemay, Julie-Anne; Brockman, Nicole; Rath, Mitchell; Doulla, Manpreet",Pediatr Diabetes,,239

434754,Clinical and Therapeutic Approach to Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients: A Pediatric Cohort in Portugal,2021,"Objective: Provide a timely, rigorous, and continuously updated summary of the evidence on the role of lopinavir/ritonavir in the treatment of patients with COVID-19. Methods: We conducted searches in the special L·OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence) platform for COVID-19, a system that performs regular searches in PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, and other 33 sources. We searched for randomized trials and non-randomized studies evaluating the effect of lopinavir/ritonavir versus placebo or no treatment in patients with COVID-19. Two reviewers independently evaluated potentially eligible studies, according to predefined selection criteria, and extracted data using a predesigned standardized form. We performed meta-analyses using random-effect models and assessed overall certainty in evidence using the GRADE approach. A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Our search strategy yielded 862 references. Finally, we identified 12 studies, including two randomized trials, evaluating lopinavir/ritonavir, in addition to standard care versus standard care alone in 250 adult inpatients with COVID-19. The evidence from randomized trials shows lopinavir/ritonavir may reduce mortality (relative risk: 0.77; 95% confidence interval: 0.45 to 1.3; low certainty evidence), but the anticipated magnitude of the absolute reduction in mortality, varies across different risk groups. Lopinavir/ritonavir also had a slight reduction in the risk of requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, developing respiratory failure, or acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, it did not lead to any difference in the duration of hospitalization and may lead to an increase in the number of total adverse effects. The overall certainty of the evidence was low or very low. Conclusions: For severe and critical patients with COVID-19, lopinavir/ritonavir might play a role in improving outcomes, but the available evidence is still limited. A substantial number of ongoing studies should provide valuable evidence to inform researchers and decision-makers soon.","Verdugo-Paiva, Francisca; Izcovich, Ariel; Ragusa, Martín; Rada, Gabriel",Medwave,,239

435356,Tracheotomy in COVID-19 patients: preliminary experience and technical refinements,2020,"Mutation and adaptation have driven the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts, including human beings, for thousands of years. Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness, such as common cold. The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have flipped the coin to reveal how devastating and life-threatening an HCoV infection could be. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has thrusted CoVs into the spotlight again and surprised us with its high transmissibility but reduced pathogenicity compared to its sister SARS-CoV. HCoV infection is a zoonosis and understanding the zoonotic origins of HCoVs would serve us well. Most HCoVs originated from bats where they are non-pathogenic. The intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoVs are also known. Identifying the animal hosts has direct implications in the prevention of human diseases. Investigating CoV-host interactions in animals might also derive important insight on CoV pathogenesis in humans. In this review, we present an overview of the existing knowledge about the seven HCoVs, with a focus on the history of their discovery as well as their zoonotic origins and interspecies transmission. Importantly, we compare and contrast the different HCoVs from a perspective of virus evolution and genome recombination. The current CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic is discussed in this context. In addition, the requirements for successful host switches and the implications of virus evolution on disease severity are also highlighted.","Ye, Zi-Wei; Yuan, Shuofeng; Yuen, Kit-San; Fung, Sin-Yee; Chan, Chi-Ping; Jin, Dong-Yan",Int J Biol Sci,,239
435457,Alterations of Lipid Profile in COVID-19: A Narrative Review,2021,"In this study, we developed ACE2-specific, peptide-derived 68Ga-labeled radiotracers, motivated by the hypotheses that (1) ACE2 is an important determinant of SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility, and (2) that modulation of ACE2 in COVID-19 drives severe organ injury. Methods: A series of NOTA-conjugated peptides derived from the known ACE2 inhibitor DX600 were synthesized, with variable linker identity. Since DX600 bears two cystine residues, both linear and cyclic peptides were studied. An ACE2 inhibition assay was used to identify lead compounds, which were labeled with 68Ga to generate peptide radiotracers ([68Ga]NOTA-PEP). The aminocaproate-derived radiotracer [68Ga]NOTA-PEP4 was subsequently studied in a humanized ACE2 (hACE2) transgenic model. Results: Cyclic DX-600 derived peptides had markedly lower IC50's than their linear counterparts. The three cyclic peptides with triglycine, aminocaproate, and polyethylene glycol linkers had calculated IC50's similar to, or lower than the parent DX600 molecule. Peptides were readily labeled with 68Ga, and the biodistribution of [68Ga]NOTA-PEP4 was determined in a hACE2 transgenic murine cohort. Pharmacologic concentrations of co-administered NOTA-PEP (""blocking"") showed significant reduction of [68Ga]NOTA-PEP4 signals in the in the heart, liver, lungs, and small intestine. Ex vivo hACE2 activity in these organs was confirmed as a correlate to in vivo results. Conclusion: NOTA-conjugated, cyclic peptides derived from the known ACE2 inhibitor DX600 retain their activity when N-conjugated for 68Ga chelation. In vivo studies in a transgenic hACE2 murine model using the lead tracer [68Ga]NOTA-PEP4 showed specific binding in the heart, liver, lungs and intestine - organs known to be affected in SARS-CoV-2 infection. These results suggest that [68Ga]NOTA-PEP4 could be used to detect organ-specific suppression of ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2 infected murine models and COVID-19 patients.","Parker, Matthew; Blecha, Joseph; Rosenberg, Oren; Ohliger, Michael; Flavell, Robert R; Wilson, David M",J. nucl. med,,239
435831,How COVID-19 has changed the dying experience for acute care patients and their families,2020,"INTRODUCTION: In the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic era, it is essential to rule out COVID-19 effectively to prevent transmission in both communities and medical facilities. According to previous reports in high prevalence areas, CT screening may be useful in the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, the value of CT screening in low prevalence areas has scarcely been reported. METHODS: This report examines the diagnostic efficacy of CT screening before admission to a hospital in Tokyo. We conducted a retrospective analysis at Keio University Hospital from April 6, 2020, through May 29, 2020. We set up an outpatient screening clinic on April 6 for COVID-19, administering both PCR with nasopharyngeal swabs and chest CT for all patients scheduled for surgery under general anesthesia. RESULTS: A total of 292 asymptomatic patients were included in this study. There were three PCR-positive patients, and they all had negative CT findings, which revealed that both the sensitivity and positive predictive value of CT (PPV) were 0%. There were nine CT-positive patients; the specificity and the negative predictive value (NPV) were 96.9% and 98.9%, respectively. CONCLUSION: CT screening was not useful in low prevalence areas at this time in Tokyo, even with the inclusion of the most prevalent phase. Given that the utility of CT screening depends on disease prevalence, the criteria for performing CT screening based on the prevalence of COVID-19 should be established.","Uchida, Sho; Uno, Shunsuke; Uwamino, Yoshifumi; Hashimoto, Masahiro; Matsumoto, Shunsuke; Obara, Hideaki; Jinzaki, Masahiro; Kitagawa, Yuko; Hasegawa, Naoki",J. infect. chemother,,239
436423,Effect of Lockdown during Covid-19 on Migraine: A Cohort Study,2020,"ABSTRACT: Inflammation has been believed to contribute to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Risk factors for death of COVID-19 pneumonia have not yet been well established.In this retrospective cohort study, we included the deceased patients in COVID-19 specialized ICU with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Guanggu hospital area of Tongji Hospital from February 8th to March 30th. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and outcome data were extracted from electronic medical records using a standard data collection form. We used Spearman rank correlation and Cox regression analysis to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death, especially the association between inflammatory cytokines and death.A total of 205âsevere/critical COVID-19 pneumonia patients were admitted in the COVID-19 specialized ICU and 75 deceased patients were included in the final analysis. The median age of the deceasing patients was 70 years (IQR 65-79). The common symptoms were fever (78.9%), cough (70.4%), and expectoration (39.4%). The BNP and CRP levels were far beyond the normal reference range. In the Spearman rank correlation analysis, IL-8 was found to be significantly associated with the time from onset to death (rs=â-0.30, Pâ=â.034) and that from admission to death (rs=â-0.32, Pâ=â.019). Cox regression showed after adjusting age and sex, IL-8 levels were still significantly associated with the time from onset to death (Pâ=â.003) and that from admission to death (Pâ =â.01).IL-8 levels were associated with in-hospital death in severe/critical COVID-19 patients, which could help clinicians to identify patients with high risk of death at an early stage.","Li, Hui; Zhang, Jun; Fang, Chen; Zhao, Xuming; Qian, Bin; Sun, Yihui; Zhou, Yan; Hu, Ji; Huang, Yun; Ma, Qi; Hui, Jie",Medicine (Baltimore),,239
437167,Vaccination against COVID-19 infection: the need of evidence for diabetic and obese pregnant women,2021,"Shortages of N95 respirators for use by medical personnel have driven consideration of novel conservation strategies, including decontamination for reuse and extended use. Decontamination methods listed as promising by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (vaporous hydrogen peroxide (VHP), wet heat, ultraviolet irradiation (UVI)) and several methods considered for low resource environments (bleach, isopropyl alcohol and detergent/soap) were studied for two commonly used surgical N95 respirators (3M&#8482; 1860 and 1870+ Aura&#8482;). Although N95 filtration performance depends on the electrostatically charged electret filtration layer, the impact of decontamination on this layer is largely unexplored. As such, respirator performance following decontamination was assessed based on the fit, filtration efficiency, and pressure drop, along with the relationship between (1) surface charge of the electret layer, and (2) elastic properties of the straps. Decontamination with VHP, wet heat, UVI, and bleach did not degrade fit and filtration performance or electret charge. Isopropyl alcohol and soap significantly degraded fit, filtration performance, and electret charge. Pressure drop across the respirators was unchanged. Modest degradation of N95 strap elasticity was observed in mechanical fatigue testing, a model for repeated donnings and doffings. CDC recommended decontamination methods including VHP, wet heat, and UV light did not degrade N95 respirator fit or filtration performance in these tests. Extended use of N95 respirators may degrade strap elasticity, but a loss of face seal integrity should be apparent during user seal checks. NIOSH recommends performing user seal checks after every donning to detect loss of appropriate fit. Decontamination methods which degrade electret charge such as alcohols or detergents should not be used on N95 respirators. The loss of N95 performance due to electret degradation would not be apparent to a respirator user or evident during a negative pressure user seal check.","Grillet, Anne M; Nemer, Martin B; Storch, Steven; Sanchez, Andres L; Piekos, Edward S; Leonard, Jonathan; Hurwitz, Ivy; Perkins, Douglas J",Exp Biol Med (Maywood),,239
437369,Outpatient clinical pharmacy practice in the face of COVID-19 at a cancer center in New York City,2021,"In this community-based cohort study, we investigated the relationship between combinations of modifiable lifestyle risk factors and infectious disease mortality. Participants were 468,569 men and women (56.5 ± 8.1, 54.6% women) residing in the United Kingdom. Lifestyle indexes included traditional and emerging lifestyle risk factors based on health guidelines and best practice recommendations for: physical activity, sedentary behaviour, sleep quality, diet quality, alcohol consumption, and smoking status. The main outcome was mortality from infectious diseases, including pneumonia, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Meeting public health guidelines or best practice recommendations among combinations of lifestyle risk factors was inversely associated with mortality. Hazard ratios ranged between 0.26 (0.23-0.30) to 0.69 (0.60-0.79) for infectious disease and pneumonia. Among participants with pre-existing cardiovascular disease or cancer, hazard ratios ranged between 0.30 (0.25-0.34) to 0.73 (0.60-0.89). COVID-19 mortality risk ranged between 0.42 (0.28-0.63) to 0.75 (0.49-1.13). We found a beneficial dose-response association with a higher lifestyle index against mortality that was consistent across sex, age, BMI, and socioeconomic status. There was limited evidence of synergistic interactions between most lifestyle behaviour pairs, suggesting that the dose-response relationship among different lifestyle behaviours is not greater than the sum of the risk induced by each behaviour. Improvements in lifestyle risk factors and meeting public health guidelines or best practice recommendations could be used as an ancillary measure to ameliorate infectious disease mortality.","Ahmadi, Matthew N; Huang, Bo-Huei; Inan-Eroglu, Elif; Hamer, Mark; Stamatakis, Emmanuel",Brain Behav Immun,,239

438452,Recommendations for the prevention and correction of thrombotic complications in COVID-19,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To explore the clinical course and its dynamic features of immune status in COVID-19 patients and find predictors correlated with severity and prognosis of COVID-19. METHODS: The electronic medical records of 204 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed by nucleic acid testing were retrospectively collected and analyzed. RESULTS: All patients were divided into severe (69) and non-severe group (135). Lymphocyte subsets count, including CD3+ T cell, CD4+ T cell, CD8+ T cell, B cell (CD19+) and NK cell (CD16+ 56+), were significantly lower in severe group (Pï¼0.001). The dynamic levels of T lymphocyte in severe group were significantly lower from disease onset, but in the improved subgroup the value of T lymphocyte began to increase after about 15-day treatment and finally returned to the normal level. The cut-off value of the counts of CD3+ (576), CD4+ (391) and CD8+ (214) T cell were calculated and indicated significantly high sensitivity and specificity for severity of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Our results shown that the decrease of CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte correlated with the course of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, especially in severe cases. The level of T lymphocyte could be used as an indicator for prediction of severity and prognosis of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. The application of glucocorticoid should be cautious in severe cases.","He, Ruyuan; Lu, Zilong; Zhang, Lin; Fan, Tao; Xiong, Rui; Shen, Xiaokang; Feng, Haojie; Meng, Heng; Lin, Weichen; Jiang, Wenyang; Geng, Qing",J Clin Virol,,239

Using examples from Zambia's industrial development experience, this book illustrates that core features of the colonial economy have not just survived six decades of independence in most African countries, but they have continued to shape the nature, scope and pace of economic activities on the continent. The book argues that since the colonial economy in Africa was not intended to serve the interests of Africans, it is imperative that the structures and the underlying rationale of the colonial economy are radically re-oriented if economic activities in Africa are to benefit the majority of Africans. Drawing from the Zambian experience, the book shows that a shift away from the colonial economy in Africa is an urgent necessity, and whilst difficult, it can be done. In particular, the book outlines a specific type of industrial policy, Frontier Industrial Policy as a key instrument for transformation. At a time when economic growth across Africa is under considerable pressure due to COVID-19, the insights in this book will be of interest to researchers across Economics, Development, Postcolonial Studies and African Studies","Chitonge, Horman",,,239

439780,Effect of COVID-19-Associated Lockdown on Patients With Diabetic Retinopathy,2021,"With the recent world-wide COVID-19 pandemic, using face masks have become an important part of our lives. People are encouraged to cover their faces when in public area to avoid the spread of infection. The use of these face masks has raised a serious question on the accuracy of the facial recognition system used for tracking school/office attendance and to unlock phones. Many organizations use facial recognition as a means of authentication and have already developed the necessary datasets in-house to be able to deploy such a system. Unfortunately, masked faces make it difficult to be detected and recognized, thereby threatening to make the in-house datasets invalid and making such facial recognition systems inoperable. This paper addresses a methodology to use the current facial datasets by augmenting it with tools that enable masked faces to be recognized with low false-positive rates and high overall accuracy, without requiring the user dataset to be recreated by taking new pictures for authentication. We present an open-source tool, MaskTheFace to mask faces effectively creating a large dataset of masked faces. The dataset generated with this tool is then used towards training an effective facial recognition system with target accuracy for masked faces. We report an increase of 38% in the true positive rate for the Facenet system. We also test the accuracy of re-trained system on a custom real-world dataset MFR2 and report similar accuracy.","Anwar, Aqeel; Raychowdhury, Arijit",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.11104v1.pdf,239
440242,Risk of COVID-19 Transmission from Infected Outpatients to Healthcare Workers in an Outpatient Clinic,2020,"Vaccination is the most promising strategy to counter the spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Vaccine hesitancy is a serious global phenomenon, and therefore the aim of this cross-sectional study was to explore the effect of educational background, work field, and social media on attitudes towards vaccination in Jordan. We compared between medical personnel who were in direct contact with patients and non-medical individuals at Jordan University Hospital in terms of demographics, knowledge about COVID-19 vaccines, rumors received via social media, their trust in these vaccines, and the encouraging factors for vaccination. 646 individuals were enrolled in this study, of which 287 (44.4%) were from medical field, and 359 (55.6%) from non-medical field. 226 (35%) were planning to take the vaccine once available, with a positive response from 131 (45.6%) medical field workers, compared to 94 (26.2%) non-medical individuals (p < 0.001). The social media rumor that was believed the most was the unsafety of these vaccines (n = 283; 43.8%). Only 163 (56.8%) of medical persons did not believe any of the circulated rumors, compared to 126 (35.1%) of non-medical persons (p < 0.001). The effect of medical personnel advice (OR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.70 to 0.98; p = 0.026) and social media (OR = 1.21; 95% CI = 1.04 to 1.41; p = 0.012) were significantly associated with the willingness to take COVID-19 vaccine once available. In conclusion, medical personnel and social media play a crucial role in increasing the society's inclination towards vaccination by providing the community with updated evidence-based information about COVID-19 vaccines as an efficient medical countermeasure and by correcting the previously spread misinformation.","Aloweidi, Abdelkarim; Bsisu, Isam; Suleiman, Aiman; Abu-Halaweh, Sami; Almustafa, Mahmoud; Aqel, Mohammad; Amro, Aous; Radwan, Neveen; Assaf, Dima; Abdullah, Malak Ziyad; Albataineh, Malak; Mahasneh, Aya; Badaineh, Ala039; Obeidat, Hala",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,239
440296,Laryngeal oedema associated with COVID-19 complicating airway management,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has created unprecedented challenges for first responders (eg, police, fire, and emergency medical services) and nonmedical essential workers (eg, workers in food, transportation, and other industries). Health systems may be uniquely suited to support these workers given their medical expertise, and mobile apps can reach local communities despite social distancing requirements. Formal evaluation of real-world mobile app-based interventions is lacking. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the adoption, acceptability, and appropriateness of an academic medical center-sponsored app-based intervention (COVID-19 Guide App) designed to support access of first responders and essential workers to COVID-19 information and testing services. We also sought to better understand the COVID-19-related needs of these workers early in the pandemic. METHODS: To understand overall community adoption, views and download data of the COVID-19 Guide App were described. To understand the adoption, appropriateness, and acceptability of the app and the unmet needs of workers, semistructured qualitative interviews were conducted by telephone, by video, and in person with first responders and essential workers in the San Francisco Bay Area who were recruited through purposive, convenience, and snowball sampling. Interview transcripts and field notes were qualitatively analyzed and presented using an implementation outcomes framework. RESULTS: From its launch in April 2020 to September 2020, the app received 8262 views from unique devices and 6640 downloads (80.4% conversion rate, 0.61% adoption rate across the Bay Area). App acceptability was mixed among the 17 first responders interviewed and high among the 10 essential workers interviewed. Select themes included the need for personalized and accurate information, access to testing, and securing personal safety. First responders faced additional challenges related to interprofessional coordination and a ""culture of heroism"" that could both protect against and exacerbate health vulnerability. CONCLUSIONS: First responders and essential workers both reported challenges related to obtaining accurate information, testing services, and other resources. A mobile app intervention has the potential to combat these challenges through the provision of disease-specific information and access to testing services but may be most effective if delivered as part of a larger ecosystem of support. Differentiated interventions that acknowledge and address the divergent needs between first responders and non-first responder essential workers may optimize acceptance and adoption.","Vilendrer, Stacie; Amano, Alexis; Brown Johnson, Cati G; Favet, Marissa; Safaeinili, Nadia; Villasenor, Jacqueline; Shaw, Jonathan G; Hertelendy, Attila J; Asch, Steven M; Mahoney, Megan",J Med Internet Res,,239

On the other hand, obesity has been linked with worst outcomes in COVID-19. Thus, the hypothesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) conducing to cerebral hemodynamic disorders (CHD) able to worsen ICCI and play an additional role on prognosis determination for COVID-19 among obese patients becomes suitable. Methods: 50 cases of SARS by COVID-19 were evaluated, for the presence of ICCI and cerebrovascular circulatory disturbances in correspondence with whether unfavorable outcomes (death or impossibility for mechanical ventilation weaning [MVW]) within 7 days after evaluation. The objective was to observe whether obese patients (BMI &#8805; 30) disclosed worse outcomes and tests results compared with lean subjects with same clinical background. Results: 23 (46%) patients among 50 had obesity. ICCI was verified in 18 (78%) obese, whereas in 13 (48%) of 27 non-obese (p = 0,029). CHD were not significantly different between groups, despite being high prevalent in both. 69% unfavorable outcomes were observed among obese and 44% for lean subjects (p = 0,075).

444102,The PaO2/FiO2 ratio on admission is independently associated with prolonged hospitalization in COVID-19 patients,2021,"Attempts to develop a protective HIV vaccine have had limited success, especially in terms of inducing protective antibodies capable of neutralizing different viral strains. As HIV transmission occurs mainly via mucosal surfaces, HIV replicates significantly in the gastrointestinal tract, and the oral route of vaccination is a convenient one to implement worldwide, we explored three SIV vaccine modalities administered orally and composed of SIV DNA priming with different boosting immunogens, with the goal of evaluating whether they could provide lasting humoral and cellular responses, including at mucosal surfaces that are sites of HIV entry. Twenty-four Cynomolgus macaques (CyM), were primed with replication-incompetent SIV DNA provirus and divided into three groups for the following booster vaccinations, all administered in the oral cavity: Group 1 with recombinant SIV gp140 and E. coli heat-labile toxin adjuvant dmLT, Group 2 with recombinant SIV-Oral Poliovirus (SIV-OPV), and Group 3 with recombinant SIV-MVA. Cell-mediated responses were measured using blood, lymph node, rectal and vaginal mononuclear cells. Significant levels of systemic and mucosal T-cell responses against Gag and Env were observed in all groups. Some SIV-specific plasma IgG, rectal and salivary IgA antibodies were generated, mainly in animals that received SIV DNA + SIV-MVA, but no vaginal IgA was detected. Susceptibility to infection after SIVmac251 challenge was similar in vaccinated and non-vaccinated animals, but acute infection viremia levels were lower in the group that received SIV DNA + SIV-MVA. Non-vaccinated CyM macaques maintained central memory and total CD4+ T cell levels in the normal range during the 5 months of post-infection follow-up as did the vaccinated animals, precluding evaluation of vaccine impact on disease progression. We conclude that the oral cavity vaccination tested in these regimens can stimulate cell-mediated immunity systemically and mucosally, but humoral response stimulation was limited with the doses and the vaccine platforms used.","Chaudhary, Omkar; Wang, Lingyun; Bose, Deepanwita; Narayan, Vivek; Yeh, Ming Te; Carville, Angela; Clements, John; Andino, Raul; Kozlowski, Pamela A; Aldovini, Anna",AIDS res. hum. retroviruses,,239

Therefore, this study was designed with the aim to address the issue of public response against COVID-19. The literature lacks studies on social aspects of COVID-19. Therefore, the current study is an attempt to investigate its social aspects and suggest a theoretical structural equation model to examine the associations between social media exposure, awareness, and information exchange and preventive behavior and to determine the indirect as well as direct impact of social media exposure on preventive behavior from the viewpoints of awareness and information exchange. The current empirical investigation was held in Pakistan, and the collected survey data from 500 respondents through social media tools were utilized to examine the associations between studied variables as stated in the anticipated study model. The findings of the study indicate that social media exposure has no significant and direct effect on preventive behavior. Social media exposure influences preventive behavior indirectly through awareness and information exchange. In addition, awareness and information exchange have significant and direct effects on preventive behavior. Findings are valuable for health administrators, governments, policymakers, and social scientists, specifically for individuals whose situations are like those in Pakistan. This research validates how social media exposure indirectly effects preventive behavior concerning COVID-19 and explains the paths of effect through awareness or information exchange. To the best of our knowledge, there is no work at present that covers this gap, for this reason the authors propose a new model. The conceptual model offers valuable information for policymakers and practitioners to enhance preventive behavior through the adoption of appropriate awareness strategies and information exchange and social media strategies.","Mehrab, Nazir Iftikhar Hussain Tian Jian Sabahat Akram Tshiaba S.

446407,COVID-19 lockdown and its impact on cancer pain management: A telephone survey of terminally ill patients,2021,"The accurate segmentation of multiple types of lesions from adjacent tissues in medical images is significant in clinical practice. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based on the coarse-to-fine strategy have been widely used in this field. However, multi-lesion segmentation remains to be challenging due to the uncertainty in size, contrast, and high interclass similarity of tissues. In addition, the commonly adopted cascaded strategy is rather demanding in terms of hardware, which limits the potential of clinical deployment. To address the problems above,we propose a novel Prior Attention Network (PANet) that follows the coarse-to-fine strategy to perform multi-lesion segmentation in medical images. The proposed network achieves the two steps of segmentation in a single network by inserting lesion-related spatial attention mechanism in the network. Further, we also propose the intermediate supervision strategy for generating lesion-related attention to acquire the regions of interest (ROIs), which accelerates the convergence and obviously improves the segmentation performance. We have investigated the proposed segmentation framework in two applications: 2D segmentation of multiple lung infections in lung CT slices and 3D segmentation of multiple lesions in brain MRIs. Experimental results show that in both 2D and 3D segmentation tasks our proposed network achieves better performance with less computational cost compared with cascaded networks. The proposed network can be regarded as a universal solution to multi-lesion segmentation in both 2D and 3D tasks.

446725,Will Africa experience a spike in COVID-19 cases?,2020,"BACKGROUND: There is consensus that planning professionals need clearer guidance on the features that are likely to produce optimal community-wide health benefits. However, much of this evidence resides in academic literature and not in tools accessible to the diverse group of professionals shaping our cities. Incorporating health-related metrics into the planning support systems (PSS) provides an opportunity to apply empirical evidence on built environment relationships with health-related outcomes to inform real-world land use and transportation planning decisions. This paper explores the role of planning support systems (PSS) to facilitate the translation and application of health evidence into urban planning and design practices to create healthy, liveable communities. METHODS: A review of PSS software and a literature review of studies featuring a PSS modelling built environmental features and health impact assessment for designing and creating healthy urban areas was undertaken. Customising existing software, a health impact PSS (the Urban Health Check) was then piloted with a real-world planning application to evaluate the usefulness and benefits of a health impact PSS for demonstrating and communicating potential health impacts of design scenarios in planning practice. RESULTS: Eleven PSS software applications were identified, of which three were identified as having the capability to undertake health impact analyses. Three studies met the inclusion criteria of presenting a planning support system customised to support health impact assessment with health impacts modelled or estimated due to changes to the built environment. Evaluation results indicated the Urban Health Check PSS helped in four key areas: visualisation of how the neighbourhood would change in response to a proposed plan; understanding how a plan could benefit the community; Communicate and improve understanding health of planning and design decisions that positively impact health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The use of health-impact PSS have the potential to be transformative for the translation and application of health evidence into planning policy and practice, providing those responsible for the policy and practice of designing and creating our communities with access to quantifiable, evidence-based information about how their decisions might impact community health.","Hooper, Paula; Boulange, Claire; Arciniegas, Gustavo; Foster, Sarah; Bolleter, Julian; Pettit, Chris",Int J Health Geogr,,239

The challenge is that many natural processes need to be considered for understanding complicated phenomena. In contrast, rules of the processes are already embedded in the time-series observation itself. Thus, inspired by largely available satellite remote sensing data and the advance of deep learning technology, we developed a purely satellite data-driven deep learning model for forecasting the sea surface temperature evolution associated with a typical phenomenon: a tropical instability wave. During the testing period of 9 years (2010-2019), our model accurately and efficiently forecasts the sea surface temperature field.

450470,"COVID-19, Cancer, and Congregation: An Observational Study from a Tertiary Care Hospital in New Delhi",2021,"During infectious disease epidemics, an important question is whether cases travelling to new locations will trigger local outbreaks. The risk of this occurring depends on the transmissibility of the pathogen, the susceptibility of the host population and, crucially, the effectiveness of surveillance in detecting cases and preventing onward spread. For many pathogens, transmission from pre-symptomatic and/or asymptomatic (together referred to as non-symptomatic) infectious hosts can occur, making effective surveillance challenging. Here, by using SARS-CoV-2 as a case study, we show how the risk of local outbreaks can be assessed when non-symptomatic transmission can occur. We construct a branching process model that includes non-symptomatic transmission and explore the effects of interventions targeting non-symptomatic or symptomatic hosts when surveillance resources are limited. We consider whether the greatest reductions in local outbreak risks are achieved by increasing surveillance and control targeting non-symptomatic or symptomatic cases, or a combination of both. We find that seeking to increase surveillance of symptomatic hosts alone is typically not the optimal strategy for reducing outbreak risks. Adopting a strategy that combines an enhancement of surveillance of symptomatic cases with efforts to find and isolate non-symptomatic infected hosts leads to the largest reduction in the probability that imported cases will initiate a local outbreak.","Lovell-Read, Francesca A; Funk, Sebastian; Obolski, Uri; Donnelly, Christl A; Thompson, Robin N",J R Soc Interface,,239

Emerging studies in the US and UK noted increased feelings of loneliness, minority stress, and vulnerability to family violence since the outbreak of COVID-19. However, little is known about LGBTIQ people's experiences of COVID-19 in Australia. This article explores the effects of COVID-19 on LGBTIQ mental health and wellbeing in Tasmania, Australia. Drawing on a survey of 231 LGBTIQ respondents aged 14-78, we use the spaces of wellbeing framework to examine the impacts of COVID-19 restrictions on LGBTIQ (in)visibility in relation to the public, private, and online spaces, arguing that COVID-19 restrictions affected LGBTIQ Tasmanians' experiences and use of spaces in ways that detracted from wellbeing, visibility, and belonging.","Grant, Ruby; Gorman-Murray, Andrew; Briohny Walker, Briohny",J Homosex,,239
451184,Correction to: Phenotypic characteristics and prognosis of inpatients with COVID-19 and diabetes: the CORONADO study,2020,"BACKGROUND: School closure is one of the main policies of global health care strategies performed worldwide. Despite all benefits, there might be some threats for younger groups spending their time in quarantine. This study aims to determine the impacts of lockdown and school closure on children's major lifestyle aspects, especially their leisure and sleep pattern during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: For the purpose of this study, an online questionnaire was distributed from 14th to 31st of March 2020 among the schools and students from the first grade to the 12th grade (before university) in Fars province, southern Iran. The questionnaire consisted of five sections which included data regarding the students' general information, activity priorities, adherence to quarantine, attitude toward school closure, and sleep patterns. RESULTS: In our study, 20,697 filled questionnaires were received from the participants with an average age of 13.76 years; 29.7% of them were male, 80.6% were from urban areas, and 83.3% were from public schools. The overall first preference of students during school closure was mobile and computer games (30.1%), followed by studying (26.6%) and watching television (13.8%). Our results demonstrated that the majority of students adhered to social distancing and there was also a significant correlation among education levels and desire for schools to be closed till the end of the semester (P = 0.015). Also, regarding sleep patterns, the majority (53.5%) had above 12 h of sleep throughout the day. CONCLUSION: It seems that lockdown following COVID-19 pandemic has changed various aspects of the students' lifestyle remarkably, especially by increasing screen time and even sleep duration and pattern. We believe that certain strategies should be implemented by the Health and Educational Ministry to control not only the visible side effects of the quarantine period, but also the collateral consequences on their psychological and mental health.","Ranjbar, Keivan; Hosseinpour, Hamidreza; Shahriarirad, Reza; Ghaem, Haleh; Jafari, Khoubyar; Rahimi, Tayebeh; Mirahmadizadeh, Alireza; Hosseinpour, Parisa",Environ Health Prev Med,,239
451574,Denominator matters in estimating COVID-19 mortality rates,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel human coronavirus that has sparked a global pandemic of the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19). The virus invades human cells through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor-driven pathway, primarily targeting the human respiratory tract. However, emerging reports of neurological manifestations demonstrate the neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV-2. This review highlights the possible routes by which SARS-CoV-2 may invade the central nervous system (CNS) and provides insight into recent case reports of COVID-19-associated neurological disorders, namely ischaemic stroke, encephalitis, encephalopathy, epilepsy, neurodegenerative diseases, and inflammatory-mediated neurological disorders. We hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion, neuroinflammation, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction may be implicated in the development of the observed disorders; however, further research is critical to understand the detailed mechanisms and pathway of infectivity behind CNS pathogenesis.","Achar, Aneesha; Ghosh, Chaitali",,,239

452522,Determinants of COVID-19 Mortality in Patients With Cancer From a Community Oncology Practice in Brazil,2021,"Introdution. In order to prevent or slow down the transmission of COVID-19, various public health measures have been introduced, including social distancing, environmental disinfection and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). In this perspective, the clinical practice of healthcare professionals has changed dramatically. As a matter of fact, the use of surgical masks and N95 has significantly worsened the job performance of workers who deal directly with COVID-19 disease. METHODS: The study included 116 health workers employed in the pulmonology, intensive care and infectious diseases departments of Bari and Foggia Hospital, directly involved in the healthcare of patients affected by COVID-19. Between May 1, 2020 and May 31, 2020, each participant completed an online questionnaire aimed to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on workers' lifestyle changes and job performances. We compared the results based on the type of mask used by each participant (surgical mask vs N95). RESULTS: Although disturbances related to the use of the mask arose earlier in subjects who wore the N95 (p = 0.0094), healthcare workers that wore surgical masks reported a statistically higher average score for a greater number of disorders. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study that compares the effects of the two most used PPE on the quality of life of health workers and which highlights the greater discomfort caused by surgical masks. This result brings to light a serious social problem, being surgical masks widely used in everyday life by ordinary people and non-healthcare workers.","Gelardi, Matteo; Fiore, Valeria; Giancaspro, Rossana; La Gatta, Emanuel; Fortunato, Francesca; Resta, Onofrio; Carpagnano, Giovanna Elisiana; Santomasi, Carla; Dimitri, Michela; Foschino Barbaro, Maria Pia; Lacedonia, Donato; Scioscia, Giulia; Antonio, Laricchiuta; Cassano, Michele",Acta Biomed,,239
453132,Diabetes and covid-19: A review,2020,"BACKGROUND: Essential workers have been shown to present a higher prevalence of positive screenings for anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. Individuals from countries with socioeconomic inequalities may be at increased risk for mental health disorders. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the prevalence and predictors of depression, anxiety, and their comorbidity among essential workers in Brazil and Spain during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A web survey was conducted between April and May 2020 in both countries. The main outcome was a positive screening for depression only, anxiety only, or both. Lifestyle was measured using a lifestyle multidimensional scale adapted for the COVID-19 pandemic (Short Multidimensional Inventory Lifestyle Evaluation-Confinement). A multinomial logistic regression model was performed to evaluate the factors associated with depression, anxiety, and the presence of both conditions. RESULTS: From the 22,786 individuals included in the web survey, 3745 self-reported to be essential workers. Overall, 8.3% (n=311), 11.6% (n=434), and 27.4% (n=1027) presented positive screenings for depression, anxiety, and both, respectively. After adjusting for confounding factors, the multinomial model showed that an unhealthy lifestyle increased the likelihood of depression (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 4.00, 95% CI 2.72-5.87), anxiety (AOR 2.39, 95% CI 1.80-3.20), and both anxiety and depression (AOR 8.30, 95% CI 5.90-11.7). Living in Brazil was associated with increased odds of depression (AOR 2.89, 95% CI 2.07-4.06), anxiety (AOR 2.81, 95%CI 2.11-3.74), and both conditions (AOR 5.99, 95% CI 4.53-7.91). CONCLUSIONS: Interventions addressing lifestyle may be useful in dealing with symptoms of common mental disorders during the strain imposed among essential workers by the COVID-19 pandemic. Essential workers who live in middle-income countries with higher rates of inequality may face additional challenges. Ensuring equitable treatment and support may be an important challenge ahead, considering the possible syndemic effect of the social determinants of health.","De Boni, Raquel Brandini; Balanzá-Martínez, Vicent; Mota, Jurema Correa; Cardoso, Taiane De Azevedo; Ballester, Pedro; Atienza-Carbonell, Beatriz; Bastos, Francisco I; Kapczinski, Flavio",J Med Internet Res,,239
453682,Are vaccines effective and safe for the prevention of COVID-19 infections? A living systematic review,2021,"Social dialogue, the foundation of our democracies, is currently threatened by disinformation and partisanship, with their disrupting role on individual and collective awareness and detrimental effects on decision-making processes. Despite a great deal of attention to the news sphere itself, little is known about the subtle interplay between the offer and the demand for information. Still, a broader perspective on the news ecosystem, including both the producers and the consumers of information, is needed to build new tools to assess the health of the infosphere. Here, we combine in the same framework news supply, as mirrored by a fairly complete Italian news database - partially annotated for fake news, and news demand, as captured through the Google Trends data for Italy. Our investigation focuses on the temporal and semantic interplay of news, fake news, and searches in several domains, including the virus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Two main results emerge. First, disinformation is extremely reactive to people's interests and tends to thrive, especially when there is a mismatch between what people are interested in and what news outlets provide. Second, a suitably defined index can assess the level of disinformation only based on the available volumes of news and searches. Although our results mainly concern the Coronavirus subject, we provide hints that the same findings can have more general applications. We contend these results can be a powerful asset in informing campaigns against disinformation and providing news outlets and institutions with potentially relevant strategies.","Gravino, Pietro; Prevedello, Giulio; Galletti, Martina; Loreto, Vittorio",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.15172v1.pdf,239

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study included 101 children aged between 2 months and 2 years diagnosed with clinical bronchiolitis between September 2011 and April 2012. The demographics and clinical, laboratory, and radiological results of the patients were recorded. Nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected and analyzed through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. The patients were followed up for at least one year for new episodes, existence of wheezing, frequency of pulmonary infections, and progression of asthma. RESULTS: In half of the patients, determinants were indicated through the PCR method, with the most frequent being respiratory syncytial virus (44%). The frequency of bronchiolitis was higher in prematures (p<0.005). There was a relationship between crowded family structure and the existence of wheezing (p=0.003), increased recurrence (p=0.014), and need for inhaler treatment (p=0.014). The frequency was higher in patients living in urban cities (p<0.001), in houses with heating stoves (p=0.001), and in houses with smokers (p=0.001). Patients living in houses with heating stoves had more severe episodes (p=0.018). Recurrent wheezing and the need for regular inhaler usage were positively correlated with high API scores (p=0.008 and p=0.002, respectively). CONCLUSION: Prematurity, exposure to smoking, living in a crowded house with heating stoves, and an urban life are the risk factors for frequent bronchiolitis. The API can be used to predict the recurrence of bronchiolitis.","Atay, Özge; Pekcan, Sevgi; Göktürk, Bahar; Özdemir, Mehmet",Turk Thorac J,,239

The purpose of this study was to determine if contrast enhancement is necessary for MRI surveillance of clinical T1a (cT1a) solid renal masses. MATERIALS AND METHODS. With institutional review board approval, 36 patients who underwent two or more contrast-enhanced (CE) MRI examinations (median, four examinations; range, two to 10 examinations) for surveillance of 39 cT1a solid renal masses between 2009 and 2019 (median time between scans, 2 years; range, 1-7 years) were evaluated. Two radiologists independently measured renal mass size and assessed tumor stage in two sessions for baseline and follow-up examinations using T1-weighted nephrographic phase CE-MRI and unenhanced single-shot T2-weighted MRI in mixed order with a 4-week washout period. Comparisons were performed using the Wilcoxon sign-rank test and Pearson correlation. Bland-Altman and intraclass correlation determined interobserver agreement. RESULTS. Mean size ± SD of renal masses on CE-MRI and T2-weighted MRI were 18 ± 5 mm (range, 9-37 mm) and 18 ± 5 mm (range, 9-37 mm) for radiologist 1 and 19 ± 7 mm (range, 10-39 mm) and 19 ± 6 mm (range, 10-39 mm) for radiologist 2 with near perfect correlation (for radiologist 1, ß = 0.9897; for radiologist 2, ß = 0.9317; p < .001). Interob-server agreement for measurements comparing radiologist 1 and radiologist 2 on CEMRI and T2-weighted MRI and intraobserver agreement for measurements on CE-MRI and T2-weighted MRI were excellent. Mean growth rate of renal masses measured on CE-MRI and T2-weighted MRI were 2 ± 2 mm (range, -5 to 8 mm) and 2 ± 3 mm (range, -3 to 8 mm) for radiologist 1 and 3 ± 5 mm (range, -1 to 18 mm) and 3 ± 6 mm (range, -1 to 24 mm) for radiologist 2 with high correlation (for radiologist 1, ß = 0.8313 [p < .001]; for radiologist 2, ß = 0.848 [p = .002]). At baseline, all tumors were subjectively cT1a on CE-MRI and T2-weighted MRI (p > .99, intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 1). During follow-up, one mass progressed to T3 on CE-MRI and T2-weighted MRI for radiologist 1 and radiologist 2 (p > .99, ICC = 1). CONCLUSION. In this study, size measurements on unenhanced T2-weighted MRI had near perfect correlation to measurements using CE-MRI in cT1a solid renal masses undergoing surveillance, with high agreement between and within observers. Clinical staging did not differ comparing T2-weighted MRI and CE-MRI, with near perfect agreement. Contrast enhancement is not necessary for follow-up size measurements in cT1a solid renal masses with MRI.","Mawi, Hatem; Narine, Rishi; Schieda, Nicola",AJR Am J Roentgenol,,239
457889,Characteristics and Pregnancy Outcomes of Asymptomatic and Symptomatic Women with COVID-19: Lessons from Hospitals in Wuhan,2021,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use has been associated with increased risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and severe outcomes. However, meta-analyses show unclear results, leading to uncertainty regarding the safety of PPI use during the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide observational study including all SARS-CoV-2 cases (n = 83,224) in Denmark as of December 1, 2020. The association of current PPI use with risk of infection was examined in a case-control design. We investigated the risk of severe outcomes, including mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit admission, or death, in current PPI users (n = 4473) compared with never users. Propensity score matching was applied to control for confounding. Finally, we performed an updated meta-analysis on risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 mortality attributable to PPI use. RESULTS: Current PPI use was associated with increased risk of infection; adjusted odds ratio, 1.08 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.13). Among SARS-CoV-2 cases, PPI use was associated with increased risk of hospital admission; adjusted relative risk, 1.13 (1.03-1.24), but not with other severe outcomes. The updated meta-analysis showed no association between PPI use and risk of infection or mortality; pooled odds ratio, 1.00 (95% CI, 0.75-1.32) and relative risk, 1.33 (95% CI, 0.71-2.48). CONCLUSIONS: Current PPI use may be associated with an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospital admission, but these results with minimally elevated estimates are most likely subject to residual confounding. No association was found for severe outcomes. The results from the meta-analysis indicated no impact of current PPI use on COVID-19 outcomes.","Israelsen, Simone Bastrup; Ernst, Martin Thomsen; Lundh, Andreas; Lundbo, Lene Fogt; Sandholdt, Håkon; Hallas, Jesper; Benfield, Thomas",Clin. gastroenterol. hepatol,,239

Whether active oncologic treatment is an additional risk factor in this population remains unclear. Therefore, here we have conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the existing evidence for the effect of active oncologic treatment on COVID-19 outcomes. METHODS: Systematic search of databases (PubMed, Embase) was conducted for studies published from inception to July 1, 2020, with a subsequent search update conducted on 10 October 2020. In addition, abstracts and presentations from major conference proceedings (ASCO, ESMO, AACR) as well as pre-print databases (medxriv, bioxriv) were searched. Retrospective and prospective studies reporting clinical outcomes in cancer patients with laboratory confirmation or clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 and details of active or recent oncologic treatment were selected. Random-effects model was applied throughout meta-analyses. Summary outcome measure was the pooled odds ratio (OR) of death for active cancer therapy versus no active cancer therapy for each of the following modalities: recent surgery, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, or chemoimmunotherapy. RESULTS: Sixteen retrospective and prospective studies (3558 patients) were included in the meta-analysis. Active chemotherapy was associated with higher risk of death compared to no active chemotherapy (OR, 1.60, 95% CI, 1.14-2.23). No significant association with risk of death was identified for active targeted therapy, immunotherapy, chemoimmunotherapy, or recent surgery. Meta-analysis of multivariate adjusted OR of death for active chemotherapy was consistently associated with higher risk of death compared to no active chemotherapy (OR, 1.42, 95% CI, 1.01-2.01). CONCLUSIONS: Active chemotherapy appears to be associated with higher risk of death in cancer patients with COVID-19.

Although the epidemic situation in China has gradually stabilized, the severe situation in the world still inevitably impacts China's economy. Based on the uncertainty of future epidemic, this paper sets up three scenarios to analyze the impact of the epidemic on China's economy. The first is that in June, the epidemic both at home and abroad is under control without rebound; the second is that the domestic epidemic is basically controlled but the foreign situation is not effectively controlled; the third is that the epidemic situation in China has a serious rebound due to the influence of the imported cases from abroad, which destroy the economy again. At the same time, some corresponding guidelines are put forward for the recovery of economy, and to minimize the economic losses as well as accelerate the pace of national economic recovery. In addition, it is believed that these suggestions may have certain reference value to other countries.","Pan, Wei; Huang, Ge; Shi, Yongdong; Hu, Cheng; Dai, Wan-Qiang; Pan, Wulin; Rongsheng, Huang",Glob Chall,,239

These actions expanded the scope and scale of the collaborations with these sectors, as well as establishing a quality assurance system in VET. Additionally, the greater proportion of on-the-job training programs established through these reforms have increased students' skill development. Research and development centers focusing on intellectual property were established as centers of excellence in VET, and patent, utility model, design, and trademark productions and registration processes were also prioritized during this period. At this point, the Ministry of National Education (MoNE) has taken a new step to improve the quality of VET and alleviate the achievement gap by starting the ""1,000 Schools in Vocational Education and Training"" Project. The present study introduces this project and discusses its aims and scope in detail. The project implements a holistic approach towards narrowing the achievement gap, aiming to improve the infrastructure and educational environments of VET schools through considerable investments in school development, as well as building teachers and executive leaders' capacities. Additionally, students' educational and personal development will be supported in a multifaceted way to compensate for deficiencies in basic skills. Parents will also be supported through planned lifelong learning mechanisms. When the initial project has been completed after one year, the improvement in VET will be scaled up to expand to all schools in Turkey. Ideally, the 1,000 Schools Project will help to narrow the achievement gap between high schools in Turkey.","Özer, Mahmut",Bartin &amp;Uuml;niversitesi Egitim Fakültesi Dergisi,,239
461001,"Health and Institutional Risk Factors of COVID-19 Mortality in Mexico, 2020",2020,"SARS-CoV-2, a novel emerging coronavirus, has caused severe disease (COVID-19), and rapidly spread worldwide since the beginning of 2020. SARS-CoV-2 mainly spreads by coughing, sneezing, droplet inhalation, and contact. SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in saliva samples, making saliva a potential transmission route for COVID-19. The participants in dental practice confront a particular risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection due to close contact with the patients and potential exposure to saliva-contaminated droplets and aerosols generated during dental procedures. In addition, saliva-contaminated surfaces could lead to potential cross-infection. Hence, the control of saliva-related transmission in the dental clinic is critical, particularly in the epidemic period of COVID-19. Based on our experience of the COVID-19 epidemic, some protective measures that can help reduce the risk of saliva-related transmission are suggested, in order to avoid the potential spread of SARS-CoV-2 among patients, visitors, and dental practitioners.","Li, Yuqing; Ren, Biao; Peng, Xian; Hu, Tao; Li, Jiyao; Gong, Tao; Tang, Boyu; Xu, Xin; Zhou, Xuedong",Mol. oral microbiol.

Most of these tests and vaccines are based on the Spike glycoprotein (S) or the Nucleocapsid (N) viral protein. Conservation of these antigens among viral strains is critical to ensure optimum diagnostic test performance and broad protective efficacy, respectively. We assessed N and S antigen diversity from 17,853 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences and evaluated selection pressure. Up to 6-7 incipient phylogenetic clades were identified for both antigens, confirming early variants of the S antigen and identifying new ones. Significant diversifying selection was detected at multiple sites for both antigens. Some sequence variants have already spread in multiple regions, in spite of their low frequency. In conclusion, the N and S antigens of SARS-CoV-2 are well-conserved antigens, but new clades are emerging and may need to be included in future diagnostic and vaccine formulations.","Dumonteil, Eric; Herrera, Claudia",,,239

We conducted a cross-sectional survey on recreational road runners to investigate the type of built and natural environments road runners prefer, as well as the safety and health concerns that may affect runners' choice of environment. Responses were analyzed by age and gender. A total of 1228 road runners responded to the survey; 59.6% of respondents were women and 32.1% of respondents were men. Most respondents preferred to run on asphalt or sidewalk surfaces, and preferred well-lit, tree-lined routes. Major concerns for both men and women include animals and dangerous road conditions. Men and women differed significantly in their responses to the importance of running around others and their primary concerns while running. Results of this study serve to deepen our understanding of recreational road runners' environmental preferences and concerns, providing valuable information for public health officials and city planners alike.

BACKGROUND: The emerging SARS-CoV-2 infection has galvanized collaborative and multidisciplinary efforts in clinical and research practice worldwide. The scarce evidence-base to manage patients with COVID-19 has included limited nurse-led research. INTRODUCTION: Clinical research nurses have greatly contributed to the delivery of COVID-19 research, yet the number of COVID-19 nursing-led research papers appears to be limited, with even fewer nurse-led research projects funded. METHODS: Authors' views and PubMed search on 'COVID-19 and nursing'. FINDINGS: There is a dearth of nursing-led research. Most papers describe the nursing contribution to COVID-19 care, changes in nursing working arrangements and emotional burden. There are opportunities to explore the consequences to vulnerable population groups of public health measures implemented to stop the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic. DISCUSSION: Workforce gaps, limited integration in research structures and clinical redeployment may have hampered nurse-led research. COVID-19 may exacerbate staffing deficits by disrupting the education pipeline, obstructing the transition from clinical to academic practice, particularly in areas where clinical academic roles are yet to emerge. CONCLUSION: The absence of nurse-led research in COVID-19 can be explained by chronic, underlying factors and the features of the pandemic response. Emerging models of care, effective staffing and inequalities related to COVID-19 appear obvious research areas. Nursing leadership needs to strengthen its political voice and lobbying skills to secure nurse-led research funding. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING POLICY: Embracing international nursing research, strengthening collaborations and lobbying policymakers for investment in nurse-sensitive research would enhance the response to COVID-19.","Castro-Sánchez, E; Russell, A M; Dolman, L; Wells, M",Int. nurs. rev,,239

However, most patients experience symptoms related to esophageal dysmotility when eating or drinking upright. The aims of this study are to: (1) compare HREMI metrics in supine versus upright position; and (2) determine if upright position alters motility characterization of patients. METHODS: HREMI of twelve wet swallows in supine position and five wet swallows in upright position were performed on normal subjects (NS) and consecutive patients. Chicago Classification v3.0 (CC) diagnoses were evaluated in the supine position and a modified version of the Chicago Classification system was used in the upright position using normative upright values for DCI and IRP. RESULTS: DCI decreased in NS by 414 mmHg × cm × sec (p = 0.001) and patients by 613 mmHg × cm × sec (p < 0.001). IRP decreased in NS by 6.2 mmHg (p < 0.001) and patients by 4.6 mmHg (p < 0.001). The rate of successful bolus clearance decreased in the upright position in patients by 11% (p < 0.001), but no statistically significant differences were observed in NS. 82 of 200 patients (41%) had a change in CC diagnosis in the upright position. Bolus clearance in the upright position varied in patients depending on their diagnosis in the upright position. CONCLUSIONS: Upright swallows had lower LES, IRP, DCI and UES pressures in both normal subjects and patients with decreased bolus clearance in patients. Upright positioning can alter esophageal motility patterns and enhance diagnostic yield. Thus, upright swallows supplement supine swallows to help characterize esophageal dysmotility.","Tanner, Samuel; Vachhani, Herit; Harrison, Martha; Malik, Zubair; Schey, Ron; Parkman, Henry P",Esophagus,,239

One of the widely used mathematical models of long-term spreading of epidemics are the so-called deterministic compartmental models (SIR/SEIR type models). One of the main purposes of applying such models is to assess how the expensive restriction measures imposed by the authorities (home and social isolation/quarantine, travel restrictions, etc.) can effectively reduce the control reproduction number of the disease and its transmission risk. However the classical SIR/SEIR models have been primarily studied in what may be called stationary case, where the main parameters, the Transmission rate Beta (reflecting the virus spread by infected individuals) and the Removed rate Gamma (reflecting the hospitalization/isolation measures) remain constant during the whole period of interest. Hence, it is important to extend the classical SIR/SEIR models by creating new ansatzes for the dynamics of the transmission rates Beta(t) (which we will call further just Beta) and removed rates Gamma(t) (which we will call further just Gamma). The main purpose of the present research is to introduce a spline-based SEIR model with Time-varying Beta and Gamma parameters, or abbreviated TVBG-SEIR model, which is used to estimate the practical implications of the public health interventions and measures. We have designed a Tool based on the TVBG-SEIR model, which may be used as a Decision Support Tool to assist the health decision- and policy-makers in creating predictive scenarios.","Kounchev, Ognyan; Simeonov, Georgi; Kuncheva, Zhana",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.11338v2.pdf,239

AIM: We aimed to evaluate the visual and quantitative pneumonia severity on chest computed tomography (CT) in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and compare the CT findings with clinical and laboratory findings. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated adult COVID-19 patients who underwent chest CT, clinical scores, laboratory findings, and length of hospital stay. Two independent radiologists visually evaluated the pneumonia severity on chest CT (VSQS). Quantitative CT (QCT) assessment was performed using a free DICOM viewer, and the percentage of the well-aerated lung (%WAL), high-attenuation areas (%HAA) at different threshold values, and mean lung attenuation (MLA) values were calculated. The relationship between CT scores and the clinical, laboratory data, and length of hospital stay were evaluated in this cross-sectional study. The student's t-test and chi-square test were used to analyze the differences between variables. The Pearson correlation test analyzed the correlation between variables. The diagnostic performance of the variables was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used. RESULTS: The VSQS and QCT scores were significantly correlated with procalcitonin, d-dimer, ferritin, and C-reactive protein levels. Both VSQ and QCT scores were significantly correlated with disease severity (p<0.001). Among the QCT parameters, the %HAA-600 value showed the best correlation with the VSQS (r=730,p<0.001). VSQS and QCT scores had high sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing disease severity and predicting prolonged hospitalization. CONCLUSION: The VSQS and QCT scores can help manage the COVID-19 and predict the duration of hospitalization.","Kaya, Furkan; Konya, Petek Sarlak; Demirel, Emin; Demirtürk, Nese; Orhan, Semiha; Ufuk, Furkan",,,239

476592,Health Issues and Immunological Assessment Related to Wuhan's COVID-19 Survivors: A Multicenter Follow-Up Study,2021,"Genome assembly is a fundamental problem in Bioinformatics, requiring to reconstruct a source genome from an assembly graph built from a set of reads (short strings sequenced from the genome). A notion of genome assembly solution is that of an arc-covering walk of the graph. Since assembly graphs admit many solutions, the goal is to find what is definitely present in all solutions, or what is safe. Most practical assemblers are based on heuristics having at their core unitigs, namely paths whose internal nodes have unit in-degree and out-degree, and which are clearly safe. The long-standing open problem of finding all the safe parts of the solutions was recently solved by a major theoretical result [RECOMB'16]. This safe and complete genome assembly algorithm was followed by other works improving the time bounds, as well as extending the results for different notions of assembly solution. But it remained open whether one can be complete also for models of genome assembly of practical applicability. In this paper we present a universal framework for obtaining safe and complete algorithms which unify the previous results, while also allowing for easy generalisations to assembly problems including many practical aspects. This is based on a novel graph structure, called the hydrostructure of a walk, which highlights the reachability properties of the graph from the perspective of the walk. The hydrostructure allows for simple characterisations of the existing safe walks, and of their new practical versions. Almost all of our characterisations are directly adaptable to optimal verification algorithms, and simple enumeration algorithms. Most of these algorithms are also improved to optimality using an incremental computation procedure and a previous optimal algorithm of a specific model.","Cairo, Massimo; Khan, Shahbaz; Rizzi, Romeo; Schmidt, Sebastian; Tomescu, Alexandru I.; Zirondelli, Elia C.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.12635v2.pdf,239
476593,Health Issues and Immunological Assessment Related to Wuhan's COVID-19 Survivors: A Multicenter Follow-Up Study,2021,"Caring for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 raises ethical dilemmas in which clinicians must weigh the unknown value of an intervention against the unknown risk of viral transmission. Current guidelines for delivering high-value care in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic do not directly address ethical dilemmas that arise from the unique concerns of individual patients. We propose an ?ethical pause? in which clinicians address ethical dilemmas by taking time to ask three questions that invoke the major bioethical principles of beneficence, nonmaleficence, and distributive justice: will this intervention help my patient? Could this intervention harm my patient? Could this intervention harm or help others? Using two exemplar cases, we demonstrate how the process of deliberately asking and answering structured ethical questions is a mindful problem-solving strategy that facilitates delivery of high-value care.","Martin, Benjamin J.; Plews-Ogan, Margaret Parsons Andrew S.",Clinical Ethics,,239

It is believed that children are less likely than adults to be infected with COVID-19. In this review, we discuss different aspects of COVID-19 infection in pediatrics. COVID-19 in pediatrics occurs in the early stages of its outbreak at a high rate with a family cluster pattern mainly. Children infected with COVID-19 are mostly asymptomatic carriers and the main potential causes of the spread and transmission of the disease in com-munities. Asymptomatic children with no underlying disease or red flags should follow home isolation protocols. Children with red flags, comorbidities and risk factors or those with severe pneumonia must be admitted to the hospitals. Children’s hospitals should be equipped with the acute respiratory diseases ward, quarantine rooms, and intensive care unit to protect other patients and health care staff during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Seyedi, Seyed Javad; Shojaeian, Reza; Hiradfar, Mehran; Mohammadipour, Ahmad; Alamdaran, Seyed Ali",Iran.

This article reports findings from an Australia-wide survey that invited responses from those who changed their cycling behaviour during the pandemic lockdowns. The survey premise was that the pandemic lockdowns in each state presented the conditions of a ‘natural experiment’ to test whether the reduction in automobile traffic affected how cyclists reported experiencing the cycling environment. The survey was in the field from 3 August to 16 September 2020 with purposive sampling. A total of 699 respondents participated, with 444 complete surveys. Key questions we seek to address include: Did cycling activity increase during the pandemic shutdowns? How did cyclists from under-represented groups experience the pandemic lockdowns? The findings are twofold. First, cycling activity increased among most respondents during pandemic lockdowns for exercise and wellbeing, but not for transport. Our survey reports that for respondents the pandemic lockdowns did not result in an uptake of active transport, despite the appearance of ‘pop-up’ cycle lanes. Second, the reduced traffic of the pandemic shutdown period created a particular opportunity for women to ride bikes. The key policy implication is that cities in Australia should be designed for more relaxed modalities of mobility if the goal is to increase rates of active travel and cycling activity.","Fuller, Glen McGuinness Kieran Waitt Gordon Buchanan Ian Lea Tess",Transportation Research Interdisciplinary Perspectives,,239

Although fear appears to be a major contributing factor, there has been no systematic research to determine which specific facets of fear predict psychopathology during the coronavirus crisis. The present study is the first to examine which fear factors uniquely predict clinical levels of depressive symptoms and generalized anxiety. Data were collected from 256 adults in the United States recruited from Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) during the coronavirus pandemic. The results from logistic regression analyses demonstrated that neuroticism, coronaphobia, and hypochondriasis were fear factors that predicted pandemic-related psychopathology in adults. These findings suggest that mental health professionals should screen individuals for this set of fear factors when choosing appropriate assessments and interventions for treating people who are suffering during the crisis.","Lee, Sherman A; Crunk, Elizabeth A",Omega (Westport),,239

479882,Acute care physiotherapy management of COVID-19 patients in Qatar: Best practice recommendations,2020,"Lopinavir/ritonavir is a potent coformulation of protease inhibitors used against HIV infection. Lopinavir is the main responsible for viral load suppression, whereas ritonavir is a pharmacokinetic enhancer. Both of them have recently gained relevance as candidate drugs against severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19). However, significant beneficial effects were not observed in randomized clinical trials. This review summarizes the main physical-chemical, pharmacodynamic, and pharmacokinetic properties of ritonavir and lopinavir, along with the analytical methodologies applied for biological matrices, pharmaceutical formulations, and stability studies. The work also aimed to provide a comprehensive impurity profile for the combined formulation. Several analytical methods in four different pharmacopeias and 37 articles in literature were evaluated and summarized. Chromatographic methods for these drugs frequently use C8 or C18 stationary phases with acetonitrile and phosphate buffer (with ultraviolet detection) or acetate buffer (with tandem mass spectrometry detection) as the mobile phase. Official compendia methods show disadvantages as extended total run time and complex mobile phases. HPLC tandem-mass spectrometry provided high sensitivity in methodologies applied for human plasma and serum samples, supporting the therapeutic drug monitoring in HIV patients. Ritonavir and lopinavir major degradation products arise in alkaline and acidic environments, respectively. Other non-chromatographic methods were also summarized. Establishing the impurity profile for the combined formulation is challenging due to a large number of impurities reported. Easier and faster analytical methods for impurity assessment are still needed.","Velozo, Carolina Trajano; Cabral, Lucio Mendes; Pinto, Eduardo Costa; de Sousa, Valéria Pereira",Crit Rev Anal Chem,,239
480134,Comprehensive overview of COVID-19 clinical trials,2020,"We offer the notion of “commons” at different levels—within company, private across company, and government-sponsored across-industry sectors—and discuss how the creation of such commons enabled firms to be both efficient during normal times and resilient against the disruptions resulting from COVID-19. At the same time, there are many proven strategies providing resilience in supply chains. For instance, companies that used multiple channels to improve efficiency when facing day-to-day demand-and-supply variations found that the structure also offered resilience without additional cost when COVID struck. We discuss how the presence of commons lowers the cost for firms to adopt such resilience-building supply chain strategies. We discuss factors that impact the creation of these commons and conclude with a number of questions to guide further research into the role of industry commons in facilitating supply chain resilience. © 2021 Decision Sciences Institute","Chopra, S.; Sodhi, M.; Lücker, F.",Decision Sciences,,239

Of these, 297 were in combination treatment, 17 were on HCQ alone, and 63 did not receive either of these 2 drugs because of contraindications. The primary end point was in-hospital death. Mean age was 71.8 ± 13.4 years and 34.2% were women. We recorded 146 deaths: 35 in no treatment, 7 in HCQ treatment group, and 102 in HCQ + azithromycin treatment group (log rank test for Kaplan-Meier curve P < 0.001). At multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, age (hazard ratio (HR) 1.057, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.035-1.079, P < 0.001), mechanical ventilation/continuous positive airway pressure (HR 2.726, 95% CI 1.823-4.074, P < 0.001), and C reactive protein above the median (HR 2.191, 95% CI 1.479-3.246, P < 0.001) were directly associated with death, whereas use of HCQ + azithromycin (vs. no treatment; HR 0.265, 95% CI 0.171-0.412, P < 0.001) was inversely associated.

Staff and patients are at increased risk during an examination or intervention, so certain restrictions ought to be introduced. Hence, we aimed to measure the effect of the pandemic on endoscopy units in real-life settings. Methods: This was an observational, cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study, carried out between 7 April and 15 June 2020. Responds came from many countries, and the participation was voluntary. The survey contained 40 questions, which evaluated the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the endoscopy units and assessed the infection control. Results: A total of 312 questionnaires were filled, 120 from Hungary, and 192 internationally, and 54 questionnaires (17.3%) were sent from high-risk countries;84.9% of the gastroenterologists declared that they read the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) statement, while only 32.1% participated in any advanced training at their workplace. Overall, 92.1% of gastroenterologists realized risk stratification, and 72.1% claimed to have enough protective equipment. In 52.6% of the endoscopy units, at least one endoscopist had to discontinue the work due to any risk factor, while 40.6% reported that the reduced staff did not affect the workflow. Gastroenterologists considered that the five most important examinations both in low and high-risk patients are the following: lower/upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding with hemodynamic instability, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in obstructive jaundice, foreign body in the esophagus, ERCP in acute biliary pancreatitis, and iron deficiency anemia with hemodynamic instability, which correlates well with the ESGE recommendation. Significant correlation was found in the usage of the necessary protective equipment in high-risk patients depending on the countries (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: The survey found weak correlation in preliminary training depending on countries;nevertheless, in Hungary during the examined period, endoscopists considered the recommendations more strictly than in other countries. Although many physicians left the endoscopy lab, the workflow was not affected, probably due to the reduced number of examinations.

The identification of barriers to physical activity may assist in developing strategies to increase levels of physical activity during this pandemic. The study aim was identify the barriers to regular participation in physical during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazilian adults. This cross-sectional study included 1570 [56.6% women; aged: 39.1 (37.7-40.7) years old] in social isolation due COVID-19. Barriers to physical activity were obtained using the validated questionnaires. ""Laziness and fatigue"" (50.2%), ""lack of motivation"" (31.2%), ""lack of appropriate facilities/equipment/space"" (17.4%), and ""lack of time"" (13.0%) were the barriers most prevalent in the study. Lack of motivation (OR = 1.49; 95% CI = 1.19-1.86) and lack of appropriate facilities/equipment/space (OR = 2.11; 95% CI = 1.57-2.83) were most associated with impacting physical activity levels due to the COVID-19, independent of sex, age, education level, days of social isolation and status weight. In conclusion, personal barriers to physical activity are common between both sexes, with lack of motivation and lack of appropriate facilities/equipment/space most associated with a decreased level of physical activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Farah, Breno Quintella; do Prado, Wagner Luiz; Malik, Neal; Lofrano-Prado, Mara Cristina; de Melo, Paulo Henrique; Botero, Joao Paulo; Cucato, Gabriel Grizzo; de Almeida Correia, Marilia; Ritti-Dias, Raphael Mendes",Sport Sci Health,,239

488780,Patient perspectives on the British Columbia Biosimilars Initiative: a qualitative descriptive study,2021,"Introduction: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV2). COVID-19 is highly contagious, potentially fatal, and a global public health concern. Combining optimized personal protective equipment (PPE) use and hand hygiene is the best strategy for preventing COVID-19 in health care workers (HCWs). Methods: We conducted a national cross-sectional web-based survey of HCWs in the infection control program (IPC) in Thailand between May 5, 2020 and May 15, 2020. The primary objective was the prevalence of optimized PPE use amongst HCWs. The secondary objective was identification of the independent predictors of optimized PPE use. Results: We received a response from 46% of HCWs (756/1650), and all those who responded were nurse or HCWs who were registered in the IPC network. Five HCWs were excluded because of missing data, and 751 were included in the final analysis. The prevalences of PPE use were 22% (168/751) for optimized PPE use, 78% (583/751) for non-optimized PPE use, 35% (263/751) for PPE overuse, and 43% (320/751) for PPE underused. In univariate analysis, optimized PPE use was significantly associated with age, education level, knowledge of appropriate negative pressure room selection, and knowledge of apparently milder symptom severity in children than adults. In multivariate analysis, independent predictors of optimized PPE use were knowledge of appropriate negative pressure room selection (aOR = 1.95, 95% CI = 1.18-3.22), the difference in symptom severity between children and adults (aOR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.37-0.81), and education level (aOR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.04-2.27). Conclusion: The prevalence of optimized PPE use amongst HCWs was 22%. Independent predictors of optimized PPE use were COVID-19 knowledge-based factors and education level. Therefore, the continued education training program should be implemented to ensure maintenance of appropriate practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. © The Author(s) 2021.","Moolasart, V.; Manosuthi, W.; Thienthong, V.; Jaemsak, U.; Kongdejsakda, W.; Pantool, P.; Chottanapund, S.",Environmental Health Insights,,239
489531,Attendance at an Emergency Dermatology consultation during 1 year of the COVID-19 pandemic: towards new sensitivities?,2021,"In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, many localities instituted non-essential business closure orders, keeping individuals categorized as essential workers at the frontlines while sending their non-essential counterparts home. We examine the extent to which being designated as an essential or non-essential worker impacts one's risk of being Covid-positive following the non-essential business closure order in Pennsylvania. We also assess the intrahousehold transmission risk experienced by their cohabiting family members and roommates. Using a difference-in-differences framework, we estimate that workers designated as essential have a 55% higher likelihood of being positive for Covid-19 than those classified as non-essential; in other words, non-essential workers experience a protective effect. While members of the health care and social assistance subsector contribute significantly to this overall effect, it is not completely driven by them. We also find evidence of intrahousehold transmission that differs in intensity by essential status. Dependents cohabiting with an essential worker have a 17% higher likelihood of being Covid-positive compared to those cohabiting with a non-essential worker. Roommates cohabiting with an essential worker experience a 38% increase in likelihood of being Covid-positive. Analysis of households with a Covid-positive member suggests that intrahousehold transmission is an important mechanism driving these effects.","Song, Hummy; McKenna, Ryan; Chen, Angela T; David, Guy; Smith-McLallen, Aaron",Int. j. health economics manag.

489593,Classification of the cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19: a rapid prospective nationwide consensus study in Spain with 375 cases,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This pathogen has spread rapidly across the world, causing high numbers of deaths and significant social and economic impacts. SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus with a suggested zoonotic origin with the potential for cross-species transmission among animals. Antarctica can be considered the only continent free of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, concerns have been expressed regarding the potential human introduction of this virus to the continent through the activities of research or tourism to minimise the effects on human health, and the potential for virus transmission to Antarctic wildlife. We assess the reverse-zoonotic transmission risk to Antarctic wildlife by considering the available information on host susceptibility, dynamics of the infection in humans, and contact interactions between humans and Antarctic wildlife. The environmental conditions in Antarctica seem to be favourable for the virus stability. Indoor spaces such as those at research stations, research vessels or tourist cruise ships could allow for more transmission among humans and depending on their movements between different locations the virus could be spread across the continent. Among Antarctic wildlife previous in silico analyses suggested that cetaceans are at greater risk of infection whereas seals and birds appear to be at a low infection risk. However, caution needed until further research is carried out and consequently, the precautionary principle should be applied. Field researchers handling animals are identified as the human group posing the highest risk of transmission to animals while tourists and other personnel pose a significant risk only when in close proximity (< 5 m) to Antarctic fauna. We highlight measures to reduce the risk as well as identify of knowledge gaps related to this issue.","Barbosa, Andrés; Varsani, Arvind; Morandini, Virginia; Grimaldi, Wray; Vanstreels, Ralph E T; Diaz, Julia I; Boulinier, Thierry; Dewar, Meagan; González-Acuña, Daniel; Gray, Rachael; McMahon, Clive R; Miller, Gary; Power, Michelle; Gamble, Amandine; Wille, Michelle",Sci Total Environ,,239

489882,Experience with online lectures about endoscopic sinus surgery using a video conferencing app,2020,"Background Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) is the cause of a pandemic disease, with severe acute respiratory syndrome by binding target epithelial lung cells through angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in humans. Thus, hypertensive patients with COVID-19 could have worse prognosis. Indeed, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACEi) inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may interfere with ACE2 expression/activity. Thus, hypertensive patients undergoing ACEi and/or ARBs drug therapy may be at a higher risk of contracting a serious COVID-19 infection and should be monitored. Moreover, in the present study we investigated the effects of ACEi vs. ARBs vs. calcium channel blockers on clinical outcomes as mechanical ventilation, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions, heart injury and death in 62 hypertensive patients hospitalized for COVID-19 infection. Methods and Results The multicenter study was prospectively conducted at Department of Infectious Diseases of Sant'Anna Hospital of Caserta, and of University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"" of Naples, at Department of Advanced Surgical and Medical Sciences of University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", Naples, and at General Medical Assistance Unit ""FIMG"", Naples, Italy. Lowest values of left ventricle ejection fraction predicted deaths (1.142; [1.008-1.294], p <0.05), while highest values of interleukin 6 (IL6) predicted the admission to ICU (1.617; [1.094-2.389]), mechanical ventilation (1.149; [1.082-1.219]), heart injuries (1.367; [1.054-1.772]) and deaths (4.742; [1.788-8.524]). ConclusionsAnti-hypertensive drugs didn't affect the prognosis in COVID-19 patients. Consequently, tailored anti-inflammatory and immune therapies in addition to chronic antihypertensive therapy, could prevent a worse prognosis, as well as improve the clinical outcomes in hypertensive patients with COVID-19 infection.","Sardu, Celestino; Maggi, Paolo; Messina, Vincenzo; Iuliano, Pasquale; Sardu, Antonio; Iovinella, Vincenzo; Paolisso, Giuseppe; Marfella, Raffaele",J Am Heart Assoc,,239

Using difference-in-difference estimation and monthly panel data from the Current Population Survey (CPS), I compare labor market attachment, non-work activity, hours worked, and earnings and wages of those in areas with early school closures and stay-in-place orders with those in areas with delayed or no pandemic closures. While there was no immediate impact on detachment or unemployment, mothers with jobs in early closure states were 68.8 percent more likely than mothers in late closure states to have a job but not be working as a result of early shutdowns. There was no effect on working fathers or working women without school age children. Mothers who continued working increased their work hours relative to comparable fathers; this effect, however, appears entirely driven by a reduction in fathers' hours worked. Overall, the pandemic appears to have induced a unique immediate juggling act for working parents of school age children. Mothers took a week of leave from formal work; fathers working fulltime, for example, reduced their hours worked by 0.53 hours over the week. While experiences were different for mothers and fathers, each are vulnerable to scarring and stunted opportunities for career growth and advancement due to the pandemic.","Heggeness, Misty L",Rev Econ Househ,,239

The COVID-19 pandemic provided an excellent opportunity to investigate the possible methods to improve Beijing's air quality meanwhile considering Beijing's economic impact. We used the TVP-VAR model to analyze the dynamic relationship among the pandemic, economy and air quality based on the daily data from 1 January to 30 August 2020. The result shows that the COVID-19 pandemic indeed had a positive effect on air governance which was good for human health, while doing business as usual would gradually weaken this effect. It shows that the Chinese authority's production restriction effectively deals with air pollution in a short period of time since the pandemic is just like a quasi-experiment that suddenly suspended all the companies. However, as the limitation stops, the improvement decreases. It is not sustainable. In addition, a partial quarantine also has a positive impact on air quality, which means a partial limitation was also helpful in improving air quality and also played an important role in protecting people's health. Second, the control measures really hurt Beijing's economy. However, the partial quarantine had fewer adverse effects on the economy than the lockdown. It is supposed to be a reference for air governance and pandemic control. Third, the more the lag periods were, the smaller their impact. Thus, restrictions on production can only be used in emergencies, such as some international meetings, while it is hard to improve the air quality and create a healthy and comfortable living environment only by limitation in the long-term.","Tao, Chenlu; Diao, Gang; Cheng, Baodong",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,239

The aim of the present survey was to investigate the epidemiology and the role of RVA and BCoV in the presentation of dairy and beef calf diarrhea in Lerma Valley of Salta province, within the Northwest region of Argentina. Stool samples of calves with or without diarrhea younger than 2 months of age were collected from 19 dairy farms and 20 beef farms between the years 2014 and 2016. Stool samples were screened for RVA and BCoV detection by ELISA. Heminested multiplex RT-PCR was used for RVA typing and RT-PCR to confirm BCoV. Positive samples were submitted to sequencing analysis. Bovine RVA and BCoV were circulating in 63% (12/19) and 10.52% (2/19) of the dairy farms, respectively, where 9.5% (46/484) of the calves were positives to RVA and 0.4% (2/484) to BCoV. In beef herds, RVA was detected in 40% (8/20) of the farms and in 6.75% (21/311) of the calves, without positives cases of BCoV. Molecular analysis showed that in dairy farms, G6P[11] and G10P[11] were the prevalent RVA strains, while in beef farms, G10P[11] was the prevalent. The main finding was the detection for the first time of a G15P[11] causing diarrhea in beef calves of Argentina that represents a new alert to be consider for future vaccine updates. Analysis of detected BCoV showed that it is related to the other circulating strains of Argentina.","Bertoni, E; Aduriz, M; Bok, M; Vega, C; Saif, L; Aguirre, D; Cimino, R O; Miño, S; Parreño, V",Trop Anim Health Prod,,239

To ameliorate the ß-cell dysfunction, it has propelled great interest to search pharmacological agents from natural plants. This study explored the protective effect of apigetrin, a flavonoid present in natural plants, against streptozotocin (STZ)-induced cell damages in RINm5F cells and the potential mechanisms. Apigetrin was found to inhibit the elevation of intracellular reactive oxygen species levels, restore the impairment of antioxidant enzymes, and recover the disruption of redox homeostasis in the STZ-treated pancreatic ß-cells. Moreover, treatment of apigetrin significantly suppressed the STZ-induced apoptosis in the analysis of apoptotic sub-G1 population and the protein expressions of cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and caspase-3. Furthermore, apigetrin attenuated STZ-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, indicated by the reduction of ER stress biomarkers, including overloading of mitochondrial calcium, increase in glucose-regulated protein 78, phosphorylation of protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase and its downstream eukaryotic initiation factor 2&#945;, cleavage of activating transcription factor 6 and caspase-12, up-regulation of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous protein, and induction of spliced X-box binding protein 1. Additionally, pretreatment with 4-phenylbutyric acid, a classic ER stress inhibitor, augmented these beneficial effects of apigetrin. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that apigetrin could improve the STZ-induced pancreatic ß-cell damages via mitigation of oxidative stress and ER stress and supported the application of apigetrin to developing the novel therapeutics of diabetes.","Zhang, Rui; Shi, Jie; Wang, Tingting; Qiu, Xiaonan; Liu, Ruixia; Li, Yitian; Gao, Qing; Wang, Ning","In vitr. cel. dev. biol., Anim",,239

A genome sequence is the core of this virus which interferes with the normal activities of its counterparts within humans. Analysis of its genome may provide clues toward the proper treatment of patients and the design of new drugs and vaccines. Microsatellites are composed of short genome subsequences which are successively repeated many times in the same direction. They are highly variable in terms of their building blocks, number of repeats, and their locations in the genome sequences. This mutability property has been the source of many diseases. Usually the host genome is analyzed to diagnose possible diseases in the victim. In this research, the focus is concentrated on the attacker's genome for discovery of its malicious properties. Results: The focus of this research is the microsatellites of both SARS and Covid-19. An accurate and highly efficient computer method for identifying all microsatellites in the genome sequences is discovered and implemented, and it is used to find all microsatellites in the Coronavirus-Covid-19 and SARS2003. The Microsatellite discovery is based on an efficient indexing technique called K-Mer Hash Indexing. The method is called Fast Microsatellite Discovery (FMSD) and it is used for both SARS and Covid-19. A table composed of all microsatellites is reported. There are many differences between SARS and Covid-19, but there is an outstanding difference which requires further investigation.

A Single-Center Prospective Experience During the Pandemic,2021,"Since the emergence of patients with COVID-19 in December 2019, the virus has rapidly spread worldwide. Children with malignant tumors are more prone to be infected and develop severe infections. Prevention and control of the pandemic and ensuring the progress of the cancer diagnosis and treatment is a significant problem in the current scenario. This article proposes a scientific management system for patients with solid tumors to guarantee emergency surgery, rationally arrange limited-term surgery, appropriately defer elective surgery, and guarantee regular chemotherapy, while protecting children from SARS-CoV-2 infection and ensuring the continuity of comprehensive diagnosis and treatment.","Cai, Jiabin; Zheng, Lili; Lv, Danni; He, Min; Xiong, Jieni; Mao, Junqing; Wang, Jinhu",Pediatr Hematol Oncol,,239

Therefore, there is a need for sampling methods that do not risk infecting them. In this study, we aimed to compare the saliva and Oro-Nasopharyngeal Swab (ONS) sampling methods. METHODS: Patients were divided into three groups. Group 1 included patients whose diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Group 2 included patients with COVID-19 compatible findings in lung computed tomography (CT), but with a negative PCR. Group 3 included patients who presented to the emergency department with COVID-19 compatible complaints but had normal CT. Saliva and ONS samples were taken on the third day of hospitalization in groups 1 and 2, whereas in group 3, they were taken at the time of admission to the hospital. RESULTS: A total of 64 patients were included in the study. The average age was 51.04 ± 17.9 years, and 37 (57.8%) were male. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 27 (42.2%) patients' saliva samples. While the sensitivity and positive predictive value of saliva samples were 85.2%, specificity and negative predictive value were 89.2%. The value of kappa was in substantial agreement (0.744), and it was found statistically significant (<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Saliva samples can be used instead of ONS samples in detecting SARS-CoV-2. Investigating SARS-CoV-2 with saliva is cheaper, easier for the patient and overall, and, most importantly, it poses much less risk of SARS-CoV-2 contamination to healthcare personnel.","Güçlü, Ertugrul; Koroglu, Mehmet; Yürümez, Yusuf; Toptan, Hande; Kose, Elif; Güneysu, Fatih; Karabay, Oguz",Rev Assoc Med Bras (1992),,239

The PPC is known to receive inputs from a collection of sensory cortices as well as various subcortical areas and integrate those inputs to facilitate the execution of functions that require diverse information. Although many recent works have been performed with the mouse as a model system, a comprehensive understanding of long-range connectivity of the mouse PPC is scarce, preventing integrative interpretation of the rapidly accumulating functional data. In this study, we conducted a detailed neuroanatomic and bioinformatic analysis of the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas data to summarize afferent and efferent connections to/from the PPC. Then, we analyzed variability between subregions of the PPC, functional/anatomical modalities, and species, and summarized the organizational principle of the mouse PPC. Finally, we confirmed key results by using additional neurotracers. A comprehensive survey of the connectivity will provide an important future reference to comprehend the function of the PPC and allow effective paths forward to various studies using mice as a model system.","Oh, Seung Wook; Son, Sook Jin; Morris, John A; Choi, Joon Ho; Lee, Changkyu; Rah, Jong-Cheol",Cereb. cortex,,239

504785,"Muscle weakness, functional capacities and recovery for COVID-19 ICU survivors",2021,"The sudden appearance and proliferation of coronavirus disease 2019 has forced societies and governmental authorities across the world to confront the possibility of resource constraints when critical care facilities are overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of grievously ill patients. As governments and health care systems develop and update policies and guidelines regarding the allocation of resources, patients and families affected by chronic disabilities, including many neuromuscular disorders that affect children and young adults, have become alarmed at the possibility that they may be determined to have less favorable prognoses due to their underlying diagnoses and thus be assigned to lower priority groups. It is important for health care workers, policymakers, and government officials to be aware that the long-term prognoses for children and young adults with neuromuscular disorders are often more promising than previously believed due to a better understanding of the natural history of these diseases, benefits of multidisciplinary supportive care, and novel molecular therapies that can dramatically improve the disease course. Although the realities of a global pandemic have the potential to require a shift from our usual, highly individualistic standards of care to crisis standards of care, shifting priorities should nonetheless be informed by good facts. Resource allocation guidelines with the potential to affect children and young adults with neuromuscular disorders should take into account the known trajectory of acute respiratory illness in this population and rely primarily on contemporary long-term outcome data.","Laventhal, Naomi T; Graham, Robert J; Rasmussen, Sonja A; Urion, David K; Kang, Peter B",Neurology,,239

506476,Regarding the lack of transparency in technical documents for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 in Peru,2020,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic. Given that such a global event might affect day-to-day stress processes, the current study examined individuals' daily stress reactivity and its moderators early in the COVID-19 pandemic. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Two-level, multilevel models examined the daily relationship between perceived stress and negative affect, or stress reactivity, as well as the moderating effects of daily pandemic worry, age, and daily positive affect on this process. Participants included 349 individuals (Age Range = 26-89) from the Notre Dame Study of Health & Well-being (NDHWB) who completed a 28-day, daily diary study at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Older individuals were less stress reactive than younger individuals. Within individuals, however, stress reactivity was buffered by daily positive affect, and exacerbated by daily pandemic worry. Finally, although daily positive affect buffered daily stress reactivity, this effect was weaker on days individuals were more worried about the COVID-19 pandemic. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The mobilization of positive emotion may be a promising avenue for buffering stress reactivity during the COVID-19 pandemic, although this may be limited on days individuals are particularly concerned about the pandemic.","Nelson, Niccole A; Bergeman, Cindy S",GerontologistGerontologist,,239

Patients and methods This was a descriptive cross-sectional study over a threemonth period from March 3 to June 3, 2020. Referred and non-referred patients received for odontostomatological emergencies were included in the study. The data collected were entered in Excel and analyzed using SPSS20.0 software with Chi2 tests performed between certain variables with a significance level set at 0.05. Results Non-referred patients represented 64.9% (n=131) of the study population and referred patients 35.1% (n=71). Emergencies were infectious in 74.7% (n=151) of cases and traumatic in 14.3% (n=29). Acute apical periodontitis was encountered in 44.6% (n=90), cellulitis in 16.4% (n=33) and pulpitis in 9.4% (n=19) of cases. Therapeutic attitudes were dominated by dental avulsion in 56.4% (n=114) of cases, pulp sedation in 9.4% (n=19) of cases and mono-maxillary restraint in 8.4% (n=17) of cases. Conclusion Despite the risk of contamination and possible dissemination of the covid19 virus, the continuity of oral care must be ensured because of the emergencies that can jeopardize the functional or even vital prognosis of patients. Certain recautions must therefore be taken at the level of the structures of care of these affections.","Tamba, Babacar Diatta Mamadou Gassama Catherine Bintou Kane Mouhammad Ba Abdou Kounta Alpha Sacko Kantara Niang Cheikh Mbacke Kebe Ndeye Fatou Tine Soukeye Dia",Advances in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery,,239

Accepted manuscripts have been peer-reviewed and copyedited, but are posted online before technical formatting and author proofing. These manuscripts are not the final version of record and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP style and proofed by the authors) at a later time. PURPOSE: To provide evidence of serum potassium changes in individuals taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and/or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) concomitantly with spironolactone compared to ACEI/ARB therapy alone. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched for studies including exposure to both spironolactone and ACEI/ARB therapy compared to ACEI/ARB therapy alone. The primary outcome was serum potassium change over time. Main effects were calculated to estimate average treatment effect using random effects models. Heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran's Q and I 2. Risk of bias was assessed using the revised Cochrane risk of bias tool. RESULTS: From the total of 1,225 articles identified, 20 randomized controlled studies were included in the meta-analysis. The spironolactone plus ACEI/ARB group included 570 patients, while the ACEI/ARB group included 547 patients. Treatment with spironolactone and ACEI/ARB combination therapy compared to ACEI/ARB therapy alone increased the mean serum potassium concentration by 0.19 mEq/L (95% CI, 0.12-0.26 mEq/L), with intermediate heterogeneity across studies (Q statistic = 46.5, P = 0.004; I 2 = 59). Sensitivity analyses showed that the direction and magnitude of this outcome did not change with the exclusion of individual studies, indicating a high level of reliability. Reporting risk of bias was low for 16 studies (80%), unclear for 3 studies (15%) and high for 1 study (5%). CONCLUSION: Treatment with spironolactone in combination with ACEI/ARB therapy increases the mean serum potassium concentration by less than 0.20 mEq/L compared to ACEI/ARB therapy alone. However, serum potassium and renal function must be monitored in patients starting combination therapy to avoid changes in serum potassium that could lead to hyperkalemia.","Villa-Zapata, Lorenzo; Carhart, Briggs S; Horn, John R; Hansten, Philip D; Subbian, Vignesh; Gephart, Sheila; Tan, Malinda; Romero, Andrew; Malone, Daniel C",Am. j. health system pharm,,239

Notably, multi-functional mixed fullerene ETLs show great potential in further improving both the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of PSCs compared to the single PC61BM ETL. In this work, we reported the mixed fullerene ETLs comprising of PC61BM and its two analogs with different length of fluorocarbon chains, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-buryric acid 1H, 1H-trifluoro-1-ethyl ester (abbr. as CF3-PC61BM) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-buryric acid 1H, 1H-tridecafluoro-1- heptyl ester (abbr. as C6F13-PC61BM).

507979,"Feasibility, safety and effectiveness of remote pulmonary rehabilitation during COVID-19 pandemic",2021,"BACKGROUND: Owing to an increase in digital technologies in health care, recently leveraged by the COVID-19 pandemic, physicians are required to use these technologies appropriately and to be familiar with their implications on patient care, the health system, and society. Therefore, medical students should be confronted with digital health during their medical education. However, corresponding teaching formats and concepts are still largely lacking in the medical curricula. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to introduce digital health as a curricular module at a German medical school and to identify undergraduate medical competencies in digital health and their suitable teaching methods. METHODS: We developed a 3-week curricular module on digital health for third-year medical students at a large German medical school, taking place for the first time in January 2020. Semistructured interviews with 5 digital health experts were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using an abductive approach. We obtained feedback from the participating students and lecturers of the module through a 17-item survey questionnaire. RESULTS: The module received overall positive feedback from both students and lecturers who expressed the need for further digital health education and stated that the field is very important for clinical care and is underrepresented in the current medical curriculum. We extracted a detailed overview of digital health competencies, skills, and knowledge to teach the students from the expert interviews. They also contained suggestions for teaching methods and statements supporting the urgency of the implementation of digital health education in the mandatory curriculum. CONCLUSIONS: An elective class seems to be a suitable format for the timely introduction of digital health education. However, a longitudinal implementation in the mandatory curriculum should be the goal. Beyond training future physicians in digital skills and teaching them digital health's ethical, legal, and social implications, the experience-based development of a critical digital health mindset with openness to innovation and the ability to assess ever-changing health technologies through a broad transdisciplinary approach to translate research into clinical routine seem more important. Therefore, the teaching of digital health should be as practice-based as possible and involve the educational cooperation of different institutions and academic disciplines.","Poncette, Akira-Sebastian; Glauert, Daniel Leon; Mosch, Lina; Braune, Katarina; Balzer, Felix; Back, David Alexander",J Med Internet Res,,239

This virus is responsible for the ongoing outbreak that causes severe respiratory illness and pneumonia-like infection in humans. Due to the increasing number of cases in China and outside China, the WHO declared coronavirus as a global health emergency. Nearly 35,000 cases were reported and at least 24 other countries or territories have reported coronavirus cases as early on as February. Inter-human transmission was reported in a few countries, including the United States. Neither an effective anti-viral nor a vaccine is currently available to treat this infection. As the virus is a newly emerging pathogen, many questions remain unanswered regarding the virus’s reservoirs, pathogenesis, transmissibility, and much more is unknown. The collaborative efforts of researchers are needed to fill the knowledge gaps about this new virus, to develop the proper diagnostic tools, and effective treatment to combat this infection. Recent advancements in plant biotechnology proved that plants have the ability to produce vaccines or biopharmaceuticals rapidly in a short time. In this review, the outbreak of 2019-nCoV in China, the need for rapid vaccine development, and the potential of a plant system for biopharmaceutical development are discussed.","Shanmugaraj, Balamurugan; Malla, Ashwini; Phoolcharoen, Waranyoo",Pathogens,,239

511409,Expert discusses the impact of COVID-19 on patients with diabetes,2020,"COVID-19 is a highly infectious respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. It has become a global pandemic and its frequent mutations may pose new challenges for vaccine design. During viral infection, the Spike RBD of SARS-CoV-2 binds the human host cell receptor ACE2, enabling the virus to enter the host cell. Both the Spike and ACE2 are densely glycosylated, and it is unclear how distinctive glycan types may modulate the interaction of RBD and ACE2. Detailed understanding of these determinants is key for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. To this end, we perform extensive all-atom simulations of the (i) RBD-ACE2 complex without glycans, (ii) RBD-ACE2 with oligomannose MAN9 glycans in ACE2, and (iii) RBD-ACE2 with complex FA2 glycans in ACE2. These simulations identify the key residues at the RBD-ACE2 interface that form contacts with higher probabilities, thus providing a quantitative evaluation that complements recent structural studies. Notably, we find that this RBD-ACE2 contact signature is not altered by the presence of different glycoforms, suggesting that RBD-ACE2 interaction is robust. Applying our simulated results, we illustrate how the recently prevalent N501Y mutation may alter specific interactions with host ACE2 that facilitate the virus-host binding. Furthermore, our simulations reveal how the glycan on Asn90 of ACE2 can play a distinct role in the binding and unbinding of RBD. Finally, an energetics analysis shows that MAN9 glycans on ACE2 decrease RBD-ACE2 affinity, while FA2 glycans lead to enhanced binding of the complex. Together, our results provide a more comprehensive picture of the detailed interplay between virus and human receptor, which is much needed for the discovery of effective treatments that aim at modulating the physical-chemical properties of this virus.","Nguyen, Kien; Chakraborty, Srirupa; Mansbach, Rachael A; Korber, Bette; Gnanakaran, Sandrasegaram",Viruses,,239

A time-dependent nonlinear system of ordinary differential equations model was constructed involving type-I cells, type-II cells, SARS-CoV-2 virus, inflammatory mediators, interleukins along with host pulmonary gas exchange rate, thermostat control, and mean pressure difference. This formalism introduced about 17 unknown parameters. Estimating these unknown parameters requires a mathematical association with the in vivo sparse data and the dynamic sensitivities of the model. The cybernetic model can simulate a dynamic response to the reduced pulmonary alveolar gas exchange rate, thermostat control, and mean pressure difference under a very critical condition based on equilibrium (steady state) values of the inflammatory mediators and system parameters. In silico analysis of the current cybernetical approach with system dynamical modeling can provide an intellectual framework to help experimentalists identify more active therapeutic approaches.","Saha, Asit; Saha, Barsha",Rev Med Virol,,239

513160,Relative Frequency and Risk Factors of COVID-19 Related Headache in a Sample of Egyptian Population: A Hospital Based Study,2021,"BACKGROUND: The media play a critical role in informing the public about the COVID-19 pandemic. Throughout the pandemic, international travel has been a highly contested subject at both the international and national levels. We examined Canadian media reporting on international travel restrictions during the pandemic, how these restrictions aligned with the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005), and how the narrative around international travel evolved over time. METHODS: We analysed articles from Canada's top three national newspapers by circulation - The Globe and Mail, The National Post and The Toronto Star - published between Jan 1, 2020 - May 31, 2020. Our search yielded a total of 378 articles across the three newspapers. After removing duplicates and screening the remaining articles, we included a total of 62 articles for the analysis. We conducted a qualitative media content analysis by using an inductive coding approach. RESULTS: Three major themes were identified within the articles. These included: 1) The role of scientific and expert evidence in implementing travel restrictions; 2) Federal legislation, regulation and enforcement of international travel measures; and 3) Compliance with World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines in travel restriction policy- and decision-making. The federal government relied primarily on scientific evidence for implementing international travel restrictions and fully exercised its powers under the Quarantine Act to enforce travel regulations and comply with the IHR 2005. The government embraced a rules-based international order by following WHO recommendations on international travel, contributing to a delay in border closure and travel restrictions until mid-March. CONCLUSION: The media focussed significantly on international travel-related issues during the early phase of the pandemic. The dominant media narrative surrounded the need for earlier travel restrictions against international travel.","Reddy, K Srikanth; Mithani, Salima S; Wilson, Lindsay; Wilson, Kumanan",BMC Public Health,,239

OBJECTIVE: To determine the variables attributable to the fear of contracting COVID-19. DESIGN: This is a quantitative study based on an online cross-sectional self-administered survey in Chile between 10 July 2020 and 10 August 2020. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A sample of 531, comprising over 18-year-old participants from middle- and high-income levels, was selected. OUTCOME MEASURES: Estimations were obtained using a probit regression model with marginal effects. RESULTS: Fear prevailed mainly in women. It has a positive relationship with variables such as chronic illnesses, infectious family or relatives, reduction in economic activity and perception of bad government response to a pandemic. Fear has a negative relationship with knowledge about COVID-19, education level and ageing. Moreover, those who consider socioeconomic impact less important than health care do not fear a COVID-19 infection. DISCUSSIONAND CONCLUSION: The socioeconomic and health aspects help predict fears. Thus, the government should prioritize these variables in implementing policies. The government's credibility and communication systems can also reduce fears of contracting COVID-19. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: A pilot focus group of COVID-19-recuperated individuals and some members of our interest groups were consulted in the design stage of the study; this helped in constructing the survey questions. Additionally, three independent individuals volunteered to read and comment on the draft manuscript.","Cerda, Arcadio A; García, Leidy Y",Health expect,,239

One of the fastest ways of finding putative drug candidates is the use of computational drug discovery approaches. The purpose of the current study is to retrieve natural compounds that have obeyed to drug-like properties as potential inhibitors. Computational molecular modelling techniques were employed to discover compounds with potential SARS-CoV-2 inhibition properties. Accordingly, the InterBioScreen (IBS) database was obtained and was prepared by minimizing the compounds. To the resultant compounds, the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) and Lipinski's Rule of Five was applied to yield drug-like compounds. The obtained compounds were subjected to molecular dynamics simulation studies to evaluate their stabilities. In the current article, we have employed the docking based virtual screening method using InterBioScreen (IBS) natural compound database yielding two compounds has potential hits. These compounds have demonstrated higher binding affinity scores than the reference compound together with good pharmacokinetic properties. Additionally, the identified hits have displayed stable interaction results inferred by molecular dynamics simulation results. Taken together, we advocate the use of two natural compounds, STOCK1N-71493 and STOCK1N-45683 as SARS-CoV-2 treatment regime.","Rampogu, Shailima; Lee, Gihwan; Kulkarni, Apoorva M; Kim, Donghwan; Yoon, Sanghwa; Kim, Myeong Ok; Lee, Keun Woo",ChemistryOpen,,239

However, the dynamics of virus shedding during the various phases of the clinical course of COVID-19 remains unclear at this stage. METHODS: A total of 18 patients found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) assay and admitted to Chongqing University Central Hospital between 29 January and 5 February 2020 were enrolled into this study. Medical data, pulmonary computed tomographic (CT) scan images and RT-PCR results were periodically collected during the patients' hospital stay. All participants were actively followed up for 2 weeks after discharge. RESULTS: A total of nine (50%) asymptomatic patients and nine (50%) patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19 were identified at admission. Six patients (66.7%) who were asymptomatic at admission developed subjective symptoms during hospitalization and were recategorized as being presymptomatic. The median duration of virus shedding was 11.5, 28 and 31 days for presymptomatic, asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients, separately. Seven patients (38.9%) continued to shed virus after hospital discharge. During the convalescent phase, detectable antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and RNA were simultaneously observed in five patients (27.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Long-term virus shedding was documented in patients with mild symptoms and in asymptomatic patients. Specific antibody production to SARS-CoV-2 may not guarantee virus clearance after discharge. These observations should be considered when making decisions regarding clinical and public health, and when considering strategies for the prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Li, W; Su, Y-Y; Zhi, S-S; Huang, J; Zhuang, C-L; Bai, W-Z; Wan, Y; Meng, X-R; Zhang, L; Zhou, Y-B; Luo, Y-Y; Ge, S-X; Chen, Y-K; Ma, Y",Clin. microbiol. infect,,239

In particular, they are less costly, provide a larger sample size, and are not reliant on the response rate. However, it is difficult to obtain an unbiased estimate of the population mean from such data due to the absence of design weights. Several estimation approaches have been proposed recently using an auxiliary probability sample which provides representative covariate information of the target population. However, when this covariate information is high-dimensional, variable selection is not a straight-forward task even for a subject matter expert. In the context of efficient and doubly robust estimation approaches for estimating a population mean, we develop two data adaptive methods for variable selection using the outcome adaptive LASSO and a collaborative propensity score, respectively. Simulation studies are performed in order to verify the performance of the proposed methods versus competing methods. Finally, we presented an anayisis of the impact of Covid-19 on Canadians.","Bahamyirou, Asma; Schnitzer, Mireille E.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15218v1.pdf,239
516509,Management of COVID-19 infection in patients undergoing hemodialysis,2021,"Nonwoven fiber materials are materials with multifunctional purposes, and are widely used to make masks for preventing the new Coronavirus Disease 2019. Because of the complexity and particularity of their structure, it becomes difficult to model the penetration and flow characteristics of liquid in nonwoven fiber materials. In this paper, a novel seepage time soft sensor model of nonwoven fabric, based on Monte Carlo (MC), integrating extreme learning machine (ELM) (MCELM) is proposed. The Monte Carlo method is used to expand data samples. Then, an ELM method is used to establish the prediction model of the dyeing time of the nonwoven fiber material overlaps with the porous medium, as well as the insertion degree and height of the different quantity of hides. Compared with the back propagation (BP) neural network and radial basis function (RBF) neural network, the results show that the prediction model based on the MCELM method has significant power in terms of accuracy and prediction speed, which is conducive to the precise and rapid manufacture of nonwoven fiber materials in practical applications between liquid seepage characteristics and structural characteristics of porous media. Furthermore, the relationship between the proposed models has certain value for predicting the behavior and use of nonwoven fiber materials with different structural characteristics and related research processes.","Zhang, Jing; Fan, Yiqiang; Zhang, Lulu; Xu, Chi; Dong, Xiaobin; Liu, Luyao; Zhang, Zhongping; Qiu, Xianbo",Sensors (Basel),,239

519958,Economic evaluation of programs against COVID-19: A systematic review,2020,"Risk perception and consequently engagement in behaviors to avoid illness often do not match actual risk of infection, morbidity, and mortality. Unrealistic optimism occurs when individuals falsely believe that their personal outcomes will be more favorable than others' in the same risk category. Natural selection could favor overconfidence if its benefits, such as psychological resilience, outweigh its costs. However, just because optimism biases may have offered fitness advantages in our evolutionary past does not mean that they are always optimal. The current project examined relationships among personal risk for severe COVID-19, risk perceptions, and preventative behaviors. We predicted that those with higher risk of severe COVID-19 would exhibit unrealistic optimism and behave in ways inconsistent with their elevated risk of morbidity and mortality. Clinical risk scores for severe COVID-19 were calculated and compared with COVID-19 threat appraisal, compliance with shelter-in-place orders (March 13-May 22, 2020) and travel restrictions, compliance with public health recommendations, and potential covariates like self-rated knowledge about COVID-19 in a robust dataset including 492 participants from McLennan County, TX, USA. While those with high clinical risk acknowledged their greater likelihood of experiencing severe illness if infected, they actually reported lower perceived likelihood of becoming infected in the first place. While it is possible that those with higher clinical risk scores truly are less likely to become infected, the pattern and significance of these results held after controlling for possible occupational exposure, household size, and other factors related to infection probability. Higher clinical risk also predicted more recent travel within Texas and lower distress during the pandemic (i.e., feeling less stressed, depressed, and helpless). Additional behavioral data suggested that those with higher clinical risk scores did not generally behave differently than those with lower scores during the shelter-in-place order. While unrealistic optimism may provide some short-term psychological benefits, it could be dangerous due to improper assessment of hazardous situations;inferring that optimism bias has evolutionary origins does not mean that unrealistic optimism is ""optimal"" in every situation. This may be especially true when individuals face novel sources (or scales) of risk, such as a global pandemic.","Gassen, J.; Nowak, T. J.; Henderson, A. D.; Weaver, S. P.; Baker, E.

519980,COVID-19 Infection in an Immunosuppressed Patient with Arthritis,2020,"Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), poses an enormous challenge to the medical system, especially the lack of safe and effective COVID-19 treatment methods, forcing people to look for drugs that may have therapeutic effects as soon as possible. Some old drugs have shown clinical benefits after a few small clinical trials that attracted great attention. Clinically, however, many drugs, including those currently used in COVID-19, such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and lopinavir/ritonavir, may cause cardiotoxicity by acting on cardiac potassium channels, especially hERG channel through their off-target effects. The blocking of the hERG channel prolongs QT intervals on electrocardiograms; thus, it might induce severe ventricular arrhythmias and even sudden cardiac death. Therefore, while focusing on the efficacy of COVID-19 drugs, the fact that they block hERG channels to cause arrhythmias cannot be ignored. To develop safer and more effective drugs, it is necessary to understand the interactions between drugs and the hERG channel and the molecular mechanism behind this high affinity. In this review, we focus on the biochemical and molecular mechanistic aspects of drug-related blockade of the hERG channel to provide insights into QT prolongation caused by off-label use of related drugs in COVID-19, and hope to weigh the risks and benefits when using these drugs.","Zequn, Zheng; Yujia, Wu; Dingding, Qian; Jiangfang, Lian",Eur J Pharmacol,,239

Encephalitis, anosmia, acute cerebrovascular disease and ageusia are some of the emerging neurological manifestations which are reported in several cohort studies on hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Although the COVID-19 pandemic is primarily associated with respiratory tract system but measures like lockdown and restricted physical movements to control the spread of this infection will certainly have neurobehavioural implications. Additionally, some of the patients with pre-existing neurological manifestations like epilepsy, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease are more prone to infection and demands extra as well as improvisation in their treatment therapy. In this review we have focused on the neurovirological clinical manifestations associated with COVID-19 pandemic. Although the prevalence of neurovirological manifestations is rare but increasing reports cannot be ignored and needs to be discussed thoroughly with respect to risk analysis and considerations for developing management strategy. This also helps in defining the burden of neurological disorders associated with COVID-19 patients.","Sharma, Sumit; Batra, Sonali; Gupta, Saurabh; Sharma, Vivek Kumar; Rahman, Md Habibur; Kamal, Mohammad Amjad","CNS neurol. disord., Drug targets (Online)",,239
521246,Exploring the link between Vitamin D and clinical outcomes in COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold, the infection-fatality risk (ie, risk of death among all infected individuals including those with asymptomatic and mild infections) is crucial for gauging the burden of death due to COVID-19 in the coming months or years. Here, we estimate the infection-fatality risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in New York City, NY, USA, the first epidemic centre in the USA, where the infection-fatality risk remains unclear. METHODS: In this model-based analysis, we developed a meta-population network model-inference system to estimate the underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection rate in New York City during the 2020 spring pandemic wave using available case, mortality, and mobility data. Based on these estimates, we further estimated the infection-fatality risk for all ages overall and for five age groups (<25, 25-44, 45-64, 65-74, and &#8805;75 years) separately, during the period March 1 to June 6, 2020 (ie, before the city began a phased reopening). FINDINGS: During the period March 1 to June 6, 2020, 205â639 people had a laboratory-confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2 and 21â447 confirmed and probable COVID-19-related deaths occurred among residents of New York City. We estimated an overall infection-fatality risk of 1·39% (95% credible interval 1·04-1·77) in New York City. Our estimated infection-fatality risk for the two oldest age groups (65-74 and &#8805;75 years) was much higher than the younger age groups, with a cumulative estimated infection-fatality risk of 0·116% (0·0729-0·148) for those aged 25-44 years and 0·939% (0·729-1·19) for those aged 45-64 years versus 4·87% (3·37-6·89) for those aged 65-74 years and 14·2% (10·2-18·1) for those aged 75 years and older. In particular, weekly infection-fatality risk was estimated to be as high as 6·72% (5·52-8·01) for those aged 65-74 years and 19·1% (14·7-21·9) for those aged 75 years and older. INTERPRETATION: Our results are based on more complete ascertainment of COVID-19-related deaths in New York City than other places and thus probably reflect the true higher burden of death due to COVID-19 than that previously reported elsewhere. Given the high infection-fatality risk of SARS-CoV-2, governments must account for and closely monitor the infection rate and population health outcomes and enact prompt public health responses accordingly as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds.

523376,"Commentary on ""Setting up a COVID-19 care facility at a prison: An experience from Pakistan""",2020,"INTRODUCTION: Evidences suggest a significant decline in maternal health service uptake following the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Ethiopia. However, COVID-19 related factors impacting the service uptake are not sufficiently addressed. Hence, the current study was intended to explore COVID-19 related factors influencing antenatal care service uptake in rural Ethiopia. METHODS: A community-based qualitative study was conducted from September 25/2020 to November 25/2020 among selected pregnant women residing in rural districts of Bench-Sheko Zone, and healthcare providers working in the local health care facilities. Six focus group discussions and 9 in-depth interviews were made between pregnant women, and health care providers, respectively. Data was collected by health education and behavioral science professionals who also have experience in qualitative data collection procedure. Data were transcribed, translated, and analyzed thematically using Open Code 4.0 software. RESULT: The study revealed several COVID-19 related factors influencing the uptake of antenatal care service during the pandemic. Health facility related barriers, perceived poor quality of care during the pandemic, government measures against COVID-19, anxiety related to the pandemic, and risk minimization were the identified factors possibly influencing the current antenatal care service uptake among women in rural Bench-Sheko Zone. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 preventive measures, and health facility related factors and individual factors were responsible for the current decline in antenatal care service uptake. Preserving essential health care service is critical to prevent avoidable losses of maternal and child lives during the pandemic period. Hence, programs and strategies designed to maintain maternal health services particularly, antenatal care service have better take the above determinants into consideration.","Hailemariam, Shewangizaw; Agegnehu, Wubetu; Derese, Misganaw",J Prim Care Community Health,,239

Governments must deploy strategies to screen the population and subsequently isolate the suspect cases. Diagnostic testing is critical for epidemiological surveillance, but the accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) and clinical utility (impact on health outcomes) of the current diagnostic methods used for SARS-CoV-2 detection are not known. I ran a quick search in PubMed/MEDLINE to find studies on laboratory diagnostic tests and rapid viral diagnosis. After running the search strategies, I found 47 eligible articles that I discuss in this review, commenting on test characteristics and limitations. I did not find any papers that report on the clinical utility of the tests currently used for COVID-19 detection, meaning that we are fighting a battle without proper knowledge of the proportion of false negatives that current testing is resulting in. This shortcoming should not be overlooked as it might hamper national efforts to contain the pandemic through testing community-based suspect cases.","Bachelet, Vivienne C",Medwave,,239

Thus, we examined the efficacy of the lymphocyte-to-neutrophil ratio (LNR) and neutrophil-to-monocyte ratio (NMR) as predictors of in-hospital death at admission in patients with severe Covid-19. A total of 54 Mexican adult patients with Covid-19 that met hospitalization criteria were retrospectively enrolled, followed-up daily until hospital discharge or death, and then assigned to survival or non-survival groups. Clinical, demographic, and laboratory parameters were recorded at admission. A total of 20 patients with severe Covid-19 died, and 75% of them were men older than 62.90 ± 14.18 years on average. Type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and coronary heart disease were more prevalent in non-survivors. As compared to survivors, LNR was significantly fourfold decreased while NMR was twofold increased. LNR ≤ 0.088 predicted in-hospital mortality with a sensitivity of 85.00% and a specificity of 74.19%. NMR ≥ 17.75 was a better independent risk factor for mortality with a sensitivity of 89.47% and a specificity of 80.00%. This study demonstrates for the first time that NMR and LNR are accurate predictors of in-hospital mortality at admission in patients with severe Covid-19.","Rizo-Téllez, Salma A.; Méndez-García, Lucia A.; Flores-Rebollo, Cruz; Alba-Flores, Fernando; Alcántara-Suárez, Raúl; Manjarrez-Reyna, Aarón N.; Baltazar-López, Neyla; Hernández-Guzmán, Verónica A.; León-Pedroza, José I.; Zapata-Arenas, Rogelio; González-Chávez, Antonio; Hernández-Ruíz, Joselín; Carrillo-Ruíz, José D.; Serrano-Loyola, Raúl; Guerrero-Avendaño, Guadalupe M.

Most large multi-lateral projects focus on sound scientific knowledge and information, and pay less attention to the design of a management structure that will ensure coherence and co-ordination of the interventions once the programme or project is under implementation. The project entitled “Reversing Environmental Degradation Trends in the South China Sea and Gulf of Thailand” was complex since it addressed three priority areas of concern namely the loss and degradation of coastal habitats, over-exploitation of fisheries in the Gulf of Thailand, and land-based pollution. It is suggested that the success of the management framework reflects the following key design elements: • The framework permitted and encouraged both “horizontal” (inter-country) and “vertical” (intra-country) interactions and networking between individuals at all levels of project implementation and execution; • Inclusion of a body (the Regional Scientific and Technical Committee) that served as a forum for reconciling both sectorial and national interests and priorities; • The clear separation between discussions of scientific and technical matters from discussions dealing with policy and principles at both the national and regional levels; • The framework facilitated the incorporation of sound scientific and technical advice and information into politically based decision-making; • The use of regional experts and consultants from the participating countries fostered “ownership” of the activities and outputs; • Restriction of the membership of the Project Steering Committee to government representatives only, and exclusion of observers from regional and international agencies and institutions other than UNEP; and, • The framework allowed for adaptive management and was not a rigid unchanging structure.","Pernetta, John C.; Jiang, Yihang",Ocean Coast Manag,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0964569112002906; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288367/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2012.10.012; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0964569112002906,239

However, studies of such infectiousness have not been reported. Object: The object of this study was estimation of reproduction numbers by age class of the source of infection and the infected persons. To do so, after examining a new procedure for reproduction number estimation, we checked infected places by age class of the source of infection and the infected persons. Method: We ignore patients who infected no one because their reliability might be lower than that of patients who infected more than one person. We estimated the reproduction number from the histogram of the number of the infected people by the same patient, assuming that the histogram follows an exponential distribution. Discussion and Conclusion: The obtained results demonstrated that the effective reproduction numbers for infection from children were very low. They were higher among adult and elderly people than among the same age class. Moreover, although the highest and second-highest infected places were other and at home with some exceptions, the data for infection at hospitals were remarkable among adults and elderly people. Among elderly people, infection at facilities for elderly was also high. Infections at nursing schools, schools, restaurants, and entertainment venues at night were negligible.","Kurita, J.; Hata, T.; Sugawara, T.; Ohkusa, Y.; Hata, A.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.14.21249854; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.14.21249854v1?rss=1,239

MuLBSTA score is a scoring system that predicts the mortality of viral pneumonia induced by a variety of viruses, including coronavirus, but the scoring system has not been verified in novel coronavirus pneumonia. The aim of this study was to validate this scoring system for estimating the risk of disease worsening in patients with COVID-19. METHODS This study included the patients who were treated between April 1 st and March 13 th , 2020. The patients were classified into mild, moderate, and severe groups according to the extent of respiratory failure. MuLBSTA score was applied to estimate the risk of disease worsening in each severity group and we validated the utility of the scoring system. RESULTS A total of 72 patients were analyzed. Among the 46 patients with mild disease, 17 showed disease progression to moderate or severe disease after admission. The model showed a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of only 34.5% with a cut-off value of 5 points. Among the 55 patients with mild or moderate disease, 6 deteriorated to severe disease, and the model showed a sensitivity of 83.3% and a specificity of 71.4% with a cut-off value of 11 points. CONCLUSIONS This study showed that MuLBSTA score is a potentially useful tool for predicting COVID-19 disease behavior.

METHODS: Between July 1 and August 31, 2020, consecutive patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were analyzed. Among these patients, those who underwent chest computed tomography (CT) examination at the time of presentation, patients with follow-up CT due to clinical deterioration were included in the study. The CTs of the patients were evaluated in terms of spleen size and volume. RESULTS: A total of 160 patients (88 females, 55%) were included in the study. The mean time between the initial and follow-up CT was 7.2 ± 2.8 days. The splenic volume (244.3 ± 136.7 vs. 303.5 ± 156.3 cm(3)) and splenic index (421.2 ± 235.5 vs. 523.2 ± 269.4 cm(3)) values were significantly higher in the follow-up CT compared to the initial CT (p < 0.001). The increase in the splenic volume and splenic index values was 59.2 ± 52.4 cm(3) and 101.9 ± 90.3 cm(3) (p < 0.001), respectively. The COVID-19 severity score was significantly higher in the follow-up CT compared to the initial CT (3.7 ± 4.2 vs. 12.5 ± 5.7, respectively; p < 0.001). The spleen width measured separately on the initial and follow-up CTs showed a highest positive correlation (r = 0.982, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that spleen size increases slightly-moderately in the first stages of the infection, and this increase is correlated with the COVID-19 severity score calculated on the chest CT data, and in this respect, it is similar to infections presenting with cytokine storm.","Tahtabasi, Mehmet; Hosbul, Tugrul; Karaman, Ergin; Akin, Yasin; Konukoglu, Osman; Sahiner, Fatih",Clin Imaging,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinimag.2021.04.035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33932872/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899707121001960; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0899707121001960,239

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, face masks have become mandatory in many situations. Acoustic attenuation of sound pressure by the mask tissue reduces speech perception ability, especially in noisy situations. Masks also can impede the process of speech comprehension by concealing the movements of the mouth, interfering with lip reading. In this prospective observational, cross-sectional study including 17 participants with normal hearing, we measured the influence of acoustic attenuation caused by medical face masks (mouth and nose protection) according to EN 14683 and of N95 masks according to EN 1149 (EN 14683) on the speech recognition threshold and listening effort in various types of background noise. Averaged over all noise signals, a surgical mask significantly reduced the speech perception threshold in noise was by 1.6 dB (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0, 2.1) and an N95 mask reduced it significantly by 2.7 dB (95% CI, 2.2, 3.2). Use of a surgical mask did not significantly increase the 50% listening effort signal-to-noise ratio (increase of 0.58 dB; 95% CI, 0.4, 1.5), but use of an N95 mask did so significantly, by 2.2 dB (95% CI, 1.2, 3.1). In acoustic measures, mask tissue reduced amplitudes by up to 8 dB at frequencies above 1 kHz, whereas no reduction was observed below 1 kHz. We conclude that face masks reduce speech perception and increase listening effort in different noise signals. Together with additional interference because of impeded lip reading, the compound effect of face masks could have a relevant impact on daily life communication even in those with normal hearing.","Rahne, Torsten; Fröhlich, Laura; Plontke, Stefan; Wagner, Luise",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253874; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34197513/,239
595399,Impact of COVID-19 on Cancer Care Delivery in Africa: A Cross-Sectional Survey of Oncology Providers in Africa,2021-03-10,"As the twenty-first century unfolds, nanotechnology is no longer just a buzzword in the field of materials science, but rather a tangible reality. This is evident from the surging number of commercial nanoproducts and their corresponding revenue generated in different industry sectors. However, it is important to recognize that sustainable growth of nanotechnology is heavily dependent on government funding and relevant national incentive programs. Consequently, proper analyses on publicly available nanotechnology data sets comprising information on the past two decades can be illuminating, facilitate development, and amend previous strategies as we move forward. Along these lines, classical statistics and machine learning (ML) allow processing large data sets to scrutinize patterns in materials science and nanotechnology research. Herein, we provide an analysis on nanotechnology progress and investment from an unbiased, computational vantage point and using orthogonal approaches. Our data reveal both well-established and surprising correlations in the nanotechnology field and its actors, including the interplay between the number of research institutes-industry, publications-patents, collaborative research, and top contributors to nanoproducts. Overall, data suggest that, supported by incentive programs set out by stakeholders (researchers, funding agencies, policy makers, and industry), nanotechnology could experience an exponential growth and become a centerpiece for economical welfare. Indeed, the recent success of COVID-19 vaccines is also likely to boost public trust in nanotechnology and its global impact over the coming years.","Talebian, Sepehr; Rodrigues, Tiago; das Neves, José; Sarmento, Bruno; Langer, Robert; Conde, João",ACS nano,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34320802/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.1c03992,239
595436,Do Anxiety and Depression Levels Affect the Inflammation Response in Patients Hospitalized for COVID-19,2021-06-17,"Global fatalities related to COVID-19 are expected to be high in 2020–2021. Developing and delivering a vaccine may be the most likely way to end the pandemic. If it were possible to shorten this development time by weeks or months, this may have a significant effect on reducing deaths. Phase II and phase III trials could take less long to conduct if they used human challenge methods—that is, deliberately infecting participants with COVID-19 following inoculation. This article analyses arguments for and against such methods and provides suggested broad guidelines for regulators, researchers and ethics committees when considering these matters. It concludes that it may be possible to maintain current ethical standards yet still permit human challenge trials in a context where delay is critical. The implications are that regulators and researchers need to work together now to design robust but short trials and streamline ethics approval processes so that they are in place when applications for trials are made.","Richards, Adair D.",J Med Ethics,https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2020-106322; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32461245/,239

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we assessed demographic, laboratory and clinical indicators as predictors for severe courses of COVID-19. METHODS: This systematic review was registered at PROSPERO under CRD42020177154. We systematically searched multiple databases (PubMed, Web of Science Core Collection, MedRvix and bioRvix) for publications from December 2019 to May 31(st) 2020. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to calculate pooled odds ratios and differences of medians between (1) patients admitted to ICU versus non-ICU patients and (2) patients who died versus those who survived. We adapted an existing Cochrane risk-of-bias assessment tool for outcome studies. RESULTS: Of 6,702 unique citations, we included 88 articles with 69,762 patients. There was concern for bias across all articles included. Age was strongly associated with mortality with a difference of medians (DoM) of 13.15 years (95% confidence interval (CI) 11.37 to 14.94) between those who died and those who survived. We found a clinically relevant difference between non-survivors and survivors for C-reactive protein (CRP; DoM 69.10 mg/L, CI 50.43 to 87.77), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; DoM 189.49 U/L, CI 155.00 to 223.98), cardiac troponin I (cTnI; DoM 21.88 pg/mL, CI 9.78 to 33.99) and D-Dimer (DoM 1.29mg/L, CI 0.9 to 1.69). Furthermore, cerebrovascular disease was the co-morbidity most strongly associated with mortality (Odds Ratio 3.45, CI 2.42 to 4.91) and ICU admission (Odds Ratio 5.88, CI 2.35 to 14.73). DISCUSSION: This comprehensive meta-analysis found age, cerebrovascular disease, CRP, LDH and cTnI to be the most important risk-factors that predict severe COVID-19 outcomes and will inform clinical scores to support early decision-making.","Katzenschlager, Stephan; Zimmer, Alexandra J.; Gottschalk, Claudius; Grafeneder, Jürgen; Schmitz, Stephani; Kraker, Sara; Ganslmeier, Marlene; Muth, Amelie; Seitel, Alexander; Maier-Hein, Lena; Benedetti, Andrea; Larmann, Jan; Weigand, Markus A.; McGrath, Sean; Denkinger, Claudia M.",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255154; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34324560/,239

However, whether SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies are produced in human milk as a result of COVID-19 vaccination is still unclear. In this study, we show that lactating mothers who received the BNT162b2 vaccine secreted SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA and IgG antibodies into milk, with the most significant increase at 3–7 days post-dose 2. Virus-specific IgG titers were stable out to 4–6 weeks after dose 2. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA levels showed substantial decay. Vaccine mRNA was detected in few milk samples (maximum of 2 ng/ml), indicative of minimal transfer. Additionally, infants who consumed post-vaccination human milk had no reported adverse effects up to 28 days post-ingestion. Our results define the safety and efficacy profiles of the vaccine in this demographic and provide initial evidence for protective immunity conferred by milk-borne SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies.

METHODS: We sampled the air from rooms for nine COVID-19 patients with illness or positive PCR > 30 days, before and after nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabbing and before and after nebulization treatment. We also sampled patients’ surroundings and healthcare workers’ personal protection equipment (PPE) in a non-ICU ward. SARS-CoV-2 was detected by PCR. RESULTS: Eighty-eight samples were collected from high-touch surfaces and floors in patient rooms and toilets, with only the bedsheets of two patients and one toilet positive for SARS-CoV-2. All air samples (n = 34) were negative for SARS-CoV-2. Fifty-five samples collected from PPE were all negative. CONCLUSION: Contamination of near-patient surroundings was uncommon for COVID-19 patients with prolonged PCR positive status if environmental cleaning/disinfection were performed rigorously.

Both models can be fitted to real data as they include parameters that can simply be estimated from the data. However SEPIR deploys an additional presymptomatic (also called asymptomatic) infectious stage that is not included in SEIR but which is known to exist in COVID-19. This stage is also parametrised and so can be fitted to data. Both SEPIR and the existing SEIR model assume a homogeneous mixing population, an idealisation that is unrealistic in practice when dynamically varying control strategies are deployed against virus. This means that if either model is to represent more than just a single period in the behaviour of the epidemic, then the parameters of the model will have to be time dependent. This issue is also discussed in this paper.

Objective: To determine the effectiveness of authorized vaccines against COVID-19 in the context of substantial circulation of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, and identify vaccine uptake barriers. Design: We recruited cases (testing positive) and controls (testing negative) based on SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostic test results from 24 February-7 April 2021. Controls were individually matched to cases by age, sex, and geographic region. We identified cases and controls via random sampling within predetermined demographic strata. We conducted enrollment and administered study questionnaires via telephone-based facilitated interviews. Setting: Population-based surveillance of all SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostic testing reported to the California Department of Public Health. During the study period, 69% of sequenced SARS-CoV-2 isolates in California belonged to variants of concern B.1.1.7, B.1.427, or B.1.429. Participants: We enrolled 645 adults aged [≥]18y, including 325 cases and 320 controls Exposures: We assessed participants' self-reported history of COVID-19 vaccine receipt (BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273). Individuals were considered fully vaccinated two weeks after second dose receipt. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary endpoint was a positive SARS-CoV-2 molecular test result. For unvaccinated participants, we assessed willingness to receive vaccination, when eligible. We measured vaccine effectiveness via the matched odds ratio of prior vaccination, comparing cases with controls. Results: Among 325 cases, 23 (7%) and 13 (4%) received BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, respectively; 8 (2%) were fully vaccinated with either product. Among 260 controls, 49 (19%) and 49 (19%) received BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, respectively; 42 (16%) were fully vaccinated with either product. Among fully vaccinated individuals, vaccine effectiveness was 86% (95% confidence interval: 67-94%). Vaccine effectiveness was 66% (-69% to 93%) and 78% (23% to 94%) one week following a first and second dose, respectively. Among unvaccinated participants, 39% of those residing in rural regions and 23% of those residing in urban regions reported hesitancy to receive COVID-19 vaccines, when eligible. In contrast, vaccine hesitancy did not significantly differ by age, sex, household income, or race/ethnicity. Conclusions and Relevance: Ongoing vaccination efforts are preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection in the general population in California. Vaccine hesitancy presents a barrier to reaching coverage levels needed for herd immunity.","Andrejko, K.; Pry, J. M.; Myers, J. F.; Jewell, N. P.; Openshaw, J.; Watt, J.; Jain, S.; Lewnard, J.

Poor immunogenicity of unadjuvanted H5N1 vaccines warrants developing novel adjuvants and formulations as well as alternate delivery systems to improve their immunogenicity and efficacy. Here, we show that Protollin, a nasal adjuvant composed of Neisseria meningitides outer membrane proteins non-covalently linked to Shigella flexneri 2a lipopolysaccharide, is a potent nasal adjuvant for an inactivated split virion H5N1 clade 1 A/Viet Nam1203/2004 (A/VN/1203/04) vaccine in a mouse model. Protollin-adjuvanted vaccines elicited enhanced serum protective hemagglutination inhibition titers, mucosal IgA responses, and H5N1-specific cell-mediated immunity that resulted in complete protection against a lethal challenge with a homologous virus as well as a heterologous clade 2 virus A/Indonesia/05/2005 (A/IN/05/05). Detailed analysis of adaptive immunity revealed that Protollin increased the frequency of lymphoid- as well as local tissue-resident antibody-secreting cells, local germinal center reaction of B cells, broad-spectrum of CD4 T cell response. Our findings suggest that nasal delivery of H5N1 vaccine with Protollin adjuvant can overcome the poor immunogenicity of H5N1 vaccines, induce both cellular and humoral immune responses, enhance protection against challenge with clade 1 and clade 2 H5N1 viruses and achieve significant antigen dose-sparing.","Cao, Weiping; Kim, Jin Hyang; Reber, Adrian J.; Hoelscher, Mary; Belser, Jessica A.; Lu, Xiuhua; Katz, Jacqueline M.; Gangappa, Shivaprakash; Plante, Martin; Burt, David S.; Sambhara, Suryaprakash",Vaccine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.05.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X1730600X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28499553/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X1730600X,239

Recent studies have shed light on the contribution of individual ISG effectors to the antiviral state, but most have examined those acting on early, intracellular stages of the viral life cycle. Here, we applied an image-based screen to identify ISGs inhibiting late stages of influenza A virus (IAV) infection. We unraveled a directly antiviral function for the gene SERPINE1, encoding plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1). By targeting extracellular airway proteases, PAI-1 inhibits IAV glycoprotein cleavage, thereby reducing infectivity of progeny viruses. This was biologically relevant for IAV restriction in vivo. Further, partial PAI-1 deficiency, attributable to a polymorphism in human SERPINE1, conferred increased susceptibility to IAV in vitro. Together, our findings reveal that manipulating the extracellular environment to inhibit the last step in a virus life cycle is an important mechanism of the antiviral response.","Dittmann, Meike; Hoffmann, Hans-Heinrich; Scull, Margaret A.; Gilmore, Rachel H.; Bell, Kierstin L.; Ciancanelli, Michael; Wilson, Sam J.; Crotta, Stefania; Yu, Yingpu; Flatley, Brenna; Xiao, Jing W.; Casanova, Jean-Laurent; Wack, Andreas; Bieniasz, Paul D.; Rice, Charles M.",Cell,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S009286741500118X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25679759/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009286741500118X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2015.01.040,239

The circumstances and stories of individual families have been picked up in the press focussing on the difficulties of people adjusting to their changed living arrangements. Yet, there have been few empirical analyses on how such changes might influence people’s health and wellbeing. Therefore, this study explored the changing patterns of perceived stress by living arrangements change during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. METHODS: The data used relates to 12,532 cohort members in the special Covid-19 surveys conducted with the participants of the 1958, 1970, 2000-01 British birth cohorts and Next Steps (born in 1989–90) in May 2020. Probit regression models were used to assess the chance of reporting increased stress amongst those who had experienced changes in living arrangements during the pandemic compared to those who had not. RESULTS: The results provide strong evidence that those individuals whose living arrangements changed during the Covid-19 pandemic have a higher likelihood of reported increased stress than those whose living arrangements remained unchanged. This was most clearly seen for older cohorts. Increased interpersonal conflict plays a role in mediating the association, especially for the younger cohort. CONCLUSIONS: The findings confirm that during the first lockdown, changing living arrangements were negatively associated with individuals’ mental wellbeing. As prolonged periods of stress can lead to serious health problems and policymakers need to be mindful that services may need to take these new, albeit for many temporary, forms of living arrangements into account.","Evandrou, Maria; Falkingham, Jane; Qin, Min; Vlachantoni, Athina",SSM Popul Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33732864/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2021.100761,239
603216,Application of telemedicine video visits in a maternal-fetal medicine practice at the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic,2021-08-24,"PURPOSE: In the current COVID pandemic, hermetically sealed eyewear is recommended for safe surgical practices to prevent eye contact with contaminated airborne particles or aerosols. These sealed eyewears definitely reduce the risk of contamination of eyes. However, there is a constant issue of fogging up of the inner surface that prevents good surgical visibility which can impair surgeons’ performance and their ability to perform fine tasks, especially in operating rooms with temperature and humidity controlled as per the COVID guidelines. We investigated the effectiveness of surface-modified anti-fog polyethylene terephthalate(PET) films and the application of a detergent-based surfactant liquid, applied to the inner aspect of viewing frame, and addition of filtered vents in the prevention of fogging up of the protective eyewears in a simulated operating room environment. METHODS: Ten volunteer orthopedic surgeons tested three modifications of a poly-hydrocarbon based hermetically sealed eyewear as a) application of a surface-modified anti-fog PET film on the inner aspect of eyewear, b) application of a detergent-based surfactant coating on the inner aspect of the protective eyewear, and c) addition of two filtered vents/holes on each side of the protective eyewear, covered with an N95 mask cutting. The testing was performed while completing a synthetic bone-based surgical task in a simulated operating room environment of 24–26° temperature and humidity between 40 and 70%, for a maximum of 2 h. The duration to the loss of clear visibility (ability to read a newspaper) and workable visibility (ability to perform the surgical task) was recorded for each volunteer. RESULTS: The detergent-based surfactant provided the longest duration of clear visibility (69.3 ± 8.16 min) and the workable visibility was maintained for more than 2 h. The second best durations of clear visibility (31.9 ± 3.75 min) and workable visibility (41.6 ± 5.39 min) were provided by the surface-modified anti-fog PET film. The addition of the filtered vents provided only a marginal improvement in the visibility. CONCLUSION: A detergent-based surfactant coating of the viewing surface provides a simple, inexpensive and effective solution to the problem of fogging of the protective eyewears. Besides this, the workable vision is maintained for a prolonged duration.","Kumar, Arvind; Qureshi, Owais Ahmed; Arora, Rajesh; Kumar, Sandeep; Jameel, Javed; Khan, Rizwan",J Clin Orthop Trauma,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S097656622030309X?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcot.2020.07.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32837102/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S097656622030309X,239

Here we investigate whether the same applies to the pandemic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is sensitive to antiviral interferons, if infection waves coincide with high airborne pollen concentrations. Our original hypothesis was that more airborne pollen would lead to increases in infection rates. To examine this, we performed a cross-sectional and longitudinal data analysis on SARS-CoV-2 infection, airborne pollen, and meteorological factors. Our dataset is the most comprehensive, largest possible worldwide from 130 stations, across 31 countries and five continents. To explicitly investigate the effects of social contact, we additionally considered population density of each study area, as well as lockdown effects, in all possible combinations: without any lockdown, with mixed lockdown−no lockdown regime, and under complete lockdown. We found that airborne pollen, sometimes in synergy with humidity and temperature, explained, on average, 44% of the infection rate variability. Infection rates increased after higher pollen concentrations most frequently during the four previous days. Without lockdown, an increase of pollen abundance by 100 pollen/m(3) resulted in a 4% average increase of infection rates. Lockdown halved infection rates under similar pollen concentrations. As there can be no preventive measures against airborne pollen exposure, we suggest wide dissemination of pollen−virus coexposure dire effect information to encourage high-risk individuals to wear particle filter masks during high springtime pollen concentrations.","Damialis, Athanasios; Gilles, Stefanie; Sofiev, Mikhail; Sofieva, Viktoria; Kolek, Franziska; Bayr, Daniela; Plaza, Maria P.; Leier-Wirtz, Vivien; Kaschuba, Sigrid; Ziska, Lewis H.; Bielory, Leonard; Makra, László; del Mar Trigo, Maria; Traidl-Hoffmann, Claudia",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33798095/; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2019034118,239

605397,Putative antiviral effects of propofol in COVID-19,2021-02-13,"Abstract Electronmicroscopy has indicated that turkey rhinotracheitis virus (TRTV), the causative agent of an acute repiratory disease in turkeys, is a member of the Paramyxoviridae family. To determine if TRTV belongs to one of the three defined genera of this family (Paramyxovirus, Morbillivirus and Pneumovirus) we have analysed the RNA and proteins induced during replication of TRTV in Vero cells. Following replication in the presence of actinomycin D 10 polyadenylated RNA bands, ranging in M r from 0.22 to 2.0 × 106, were detected in infected cells; some bands probably contained 2 or more RNA species. Viral proteins were studied after radiolabelling in the presence of [35S]methionine and [3H]glucosamine. Comparison of the polypeptides in mock-infected and infected cells, virions and nucleocapsids and after lentil-lectin chromatography and immunoprecipitation revealed seven virus-specific polypeptides (p), some of which were glycosylated (gp): gp82 (M r 82K), gp68, gp53, gp15, p43, p40 and p35. These are considered to be analogous to the large glycopolypeptide (HN, H and G), fusion protein precursor F0, the F protein cleavage products F1 and F2, nucleocapsid (N), phosphorylated (P) and matrix (M) polypeptides, respectively, of the Paramyxoviridae. Two other polypeptides (M r 200K and 22K) were also detected, as was a glycopolypeptide of M r 97K, probably related to gp82. Tunicamycin inhibited glycosylation of gp53 and gp15 but gp82 was little affected, most glycans still being present on a glycopolypeptide of approximately 79K. This finding, indicating that gp82 has mostly O-linked glycans, considered with the mRNA profile and the molecular weight of the N protein shows that of the three genera in this family, TRTV most closely resembles the Pneumovirus genus.","Cavanagh, David; Barrett, Thomas",Virus Research,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/016817028890086X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3195218/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016817028890086X,239

On the one hand, COVID-19 can reduce workplace accidents through contracted economic activities or changes in work methods. On the other hand, it can increase workplace accidents by spreading in the workplace. The main purpose of this paper is to examine how COVID-19 affected workplace accidents in Korea during the early part of the pandemic. (2) Methods: This paper utilizes the administrative data on workplace accidents in Korea collected by Korea Occupational Safety and Health Agency. In particular, we use monthly data from February 2016 to August 2020. This period was chosen to rule out the effect from the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome outbreak in 2015 and to include COVID-19 effects in 2020, given the available data. To examine the impact of COVID-19 on workplace injury and illness, we estimate fixed effects regression models, allowing us to control for group and time effects. (3) Results: COVID-19 was generally found to reduce workplace accidents in Korea, particularly through a reduction in occupational diseases. However, we also found that COVID-19 increased occupational injuries for males and workers in the transportation industry. We provide some evidence that these workers experienced an increase in workload and were unable to change work methods including working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic. (4) Conclusions: Our results indicate that to reduce workplace accidents, government interventions should be directed at workers who are unable to change work methods and who are likely to suffer an increase in work burden due to COVID-19.","Baek, Eun-Mi; Kim, Woo-Yung; Kwon, Yoon-Jeong",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34444154/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18168407,239

An alkyl or aryl substituent was also introduced at the 1-position of the octahydroisochromene scaffold and expected to introduce additional interactions with the protease. Sharpless–Katsuki asymmetric epoxidation and Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation were employed to construct the octahydroisochromene scaffold. The introductions of the P1 site His-al and the substituent at 1-position was achieved using successive reductive amination reactions. Our initial evaluations of the diastereo-isomeric mixtures (16a–d) revealed that the octahydroisochromene moiety functions as a core hydrophobic scaffold for the S2 pocket of the protease and the substituent at the 1-position may form additional interactions with the protease. The inhibitory activities of the diastereoisomerically-pure inhibitors (3a–d) strongly suggest that a specific stereo-isomer of the octahydroisochromene scaffold, (1S, 3S) 3b, directs the P1 site imidazole, the warhead aldehyde, and substituent at the 1-position of the fused ring to their appropriate pockets in the protease.","Yoshizawa, Shin-ichiro; Hattori, Yasunao; Kobayashi, Kazuya; Akaji, Kenichi",Bioorg Med Chem,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968089619319637; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0968089619319637; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2019.115273; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31926775/,239

Resistant bacteria have been demonstrated to be transmittable to humans in many different environments, including public settings in urban built environments where high-density human activity can be found, including public transport, sports arenas and schools. However, in comparison to healthcare settings and agriculture, there is very little surveillance of AMR in the built environment outside of healthcare settings and wastewater. In this review, we analyse the existing literature to aid our understanding of what surveillance has been conducted within different public settings and identify what this tells us about the prevalence of AMR.

We aimed to analyse the range and prevalence of these complications in hospitalised children and adolescents. METHODS: We did a prospective national cohort study in the UK using an online network of secure rapid-response notification portals established by the CoroNerve study group. Paediatric neurologists were invited to notify any children and adolescents (age <18 years) admitted to hospital with neurological or psychiatric disorders in whom they considered SARS-CoV-2 infection to be relevant to the presentation. Patients were excluded if they did not have a neurological consultation or neurological investigations or both, or did not meet the definition for confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (a positive PCR of respiratory or spinal fluid samples, serology for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, or both), or the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health criteria for paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS). Individuals were classified as having either a primary neurological disorder associated with COVID-19 (COVID-19 neurology group) or PIMS-TS with neurological features (PIMS-TS neurology group). The denominator of all hospitalised children and adolescents with COVID-19 was collated from National Health Service England data. FINDINGS: Between April 2, 2020, and Feb 1, 2021, 52 cases were identified; in England, there were 51 cases among 1334 children and adolescents hospitalised with COVID-19, giving an estimated prevalence of 3·8 (95% CI 2·9–5·0) cases per 100 paediatric patients. 22 (42%) patients were female and 30 (58%) were male; the median age was 9 years (range 1–17). 36 (69%) patients were Black or Asian, 16 (31%) were White. 27 (52%) of 52 patients were classified into the COVID-19 neurology group and 25 (48%) were classified into the PIMS-TS neurology group. In the COVID-19 neurology group, diagnoses included status epilepticus (n=7), encephalitis (n=5), Guillain-Barré syndrome (n=5), acute demyelinating syndrome (n=3), chorea (n=2), psychosis (n=2), isolated encephalopathy (n=2), and transient ischaemic attack (n=1). The PIMS-TS neurology group more often had multiple features, which included encephalopathy (n=22 [88%]), peripheral nervous system involvement (n=10 [40%]), behavioural change (n=9 [36%]), and hallucinations at presentation (n=6 [24%]). Recognised neuroimmune disorders were more common in the COVID-19 neurology group than in the PIMS-TS neurology group (13 [48%] of 27 patients vs 1 [<1%] of 25 patients, p=0·0003). Compared with the COVID-19 neurology group, more patients in the PIMS-TS neurology group were admitted to intensive care (20 [80%] of 25 patients vs six [22%] of 27 patients, p=0·0001) and received immunomodulatory treatment (22 [88%] patients vs 12 [44%] patients, p=0·045). 17 (33%) patients (10 [37%] in the COVID-19 neurology group and 7 [28%] in the PIMS-TS neurology group) were discharged with disability; one (2%) died (who had stroke, in the PIMS-TS neurology group). INTERPRETATION: This study identified key differences between those with a primary neurological disorder versus those with PIMS-TS. Compared with patients with a primary neurological disorder, more patients with PIMS-TS needed intensive care, but outcomes were similar overall. Further studies should investigate underlying mechanisms for neurological involvement in COVID-19 and the longer-term outcomes.

610616,Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for COVID-19 in Pregnant Women,2021-01-26,"INTRODUCTION: Since December 2019, novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection has been identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness in Wuhan, China. The classic presentation of COVID-19 infection was described as fever, myalgia, cough, and fatigue. Whether coronavirus can directly attack the endocrine glands is unclear. OBJECTIVE: Post-viral subacute thyroiditis (SAT, de Quervain thyroiditis) has been reported following other viral infection. A limited number of SAT after COVID-19 infection have been reported up to now. METHODS: Here, we reported 6 patients with SAT and positive COVID-19 serology tests. Demographic, clinical, biochemical, and imaging data were presented. RESULTS: In this study, 6 patients (4 women and 2 men) with clinician manifestations and physical examination in favor of SAT were described. Cervical ultrasonography showed bilateral hypoechoic areas in the thyroid gland which was suggestive of SAT. Elevated C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, free thyroxine, free tri-iodothyronine, and undetectable thyrotropin were found in laboratory evaluations. Both IgM and IgG were positive for COVID-19 infection, but the PCR tests were negative in all patients. Patients had history of working in a COVID center and/or family member hospitalized due to COVID-19 pneumonia. Patients were followed up for 1 month and were treated effectively with steroids. CONCLUSION: This report may help physicians to identify lesser-known manifestations and complications of COVID-19. Early diagnosis of COVID-19 infection results in the prevention of further transmission.","Sohrabpour, Saeed; Heidari, Farrokh; Karimi, Ebrahim; Ansari, Reza; Tajdini, Ardavan; Heidari, Firouzeh",Eur Thyroid J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33708633/; https://doi.org/10.1159/000511707,239

It is caused by a novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 with elusive origin. SARS-CoV-2 infects mammalian cells by binding to ACE2, a transmembrane protein. Therefore, the conservation of ACE2 and its expression pattern across mammalian species, which are yet to be comprehensively investigated, may provide valuable insights into tracing potential hosts of SARS-CoV-2. Methods We analyzed gene conservation of ACE2 across mammals and collected more than 140 transcriptome datasets from human and common mammalian species, including presumed hosts of SARS-CoV-2 and other animals in close contact with humans. In order to enable comparisons across species and tissues, we used a unified pipeline to quantify and normalize ACE2 expression levels. Results We first found high conservation of ACE2 genes among common mammals at both DNA and peptide levels, suggesting that a broad range of mammalian species can potentially be the hosts of SARS-CoV-2. Next, we showed that high level of ACE2 expression in certain human tissues is consistent with clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, we observed that ACE2 expressed in a species-specific manner in the mammals examined. Notably, high expression in skin and eyes in cat and dog suggested that these animals may play roles in transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to humans. Conclusions Through building the first atlas of ACE2 expression in pets and livestock, we identified species and tissues susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, yielding novel insights into the viral transmission.","Sun, Kun; Gu, Liuqi; Ma, Li; Duan, Yunfeng",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.015644,239

Such data are in short supply, both internationally and in South Africa. The South African blood services (the South African National Blood Service, SANBS and the Western Cape Blood Service, WCBS) are coordinating a nationally representative survey of blood donors, which it is hoped can become a cost-effective surveillance method with validity for community-level seroprevalence estimation. Methods: Leveraging existing arrangements, SANBS human research ethics committee permission was obtained to test blood donations collected on predefined days (7th, 10th ,12th ,15th ,20th ,23th and 25th January) for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, using the Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay on the cobas e411 platform currently available in the blood services’ donation testing laboratories. Using standard methods, prevalence analysis was done by province, age and race, allowing age to be regarded as either a continuous or categorical variable. Testing was performed in the Eastern Cape (EC), Free State (FS), KwaZulu Natal (ZN) and Northern Cape (NC) provinces. Results: We report on data from 4858 donors - 1457 in EC; 463 in NC; 831 in FS and 2107 in ZN. Prevalence varied substantially across race groups and between provinces, with seroprevalence among Black donors consistently several times higher than among White donors, and the other main population groups (Coloured and Asian) not consistently represented in all provinces. There is no clear evidence that seroprevalence among donors varies by age. Weighted net estimates of prevalence (in the core age range 15-69) by province (compared with official clinically-confirmed COVID-19 case rates in mid-January 2021) are: EC-63%(2.8%), NC-32%(2.2%), FS-46%(2.4%), and ZN-52%(2.4%). Conclusions: Our study demonstrates substantial differences in dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 infection between different race groups, most likely explained by historically based differences in socio-economic status and housing conditions. As has been seen in other areas, even such high seroprevalence does not guarantee population-level immunity against new outbreaks – probably due to viral evolution and waning of antibody neutralization. Despite its limitations, notably a ‘healthy donor’ effect, it seems plausible that these estimates are reasonably generalisable to actual population level anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence, but should be further verified.","Sykes, Wendy; Mhlanga, Laurette; Swanevelder, Ronel; Glatt, Tanya Nadia; Grebe, Eduard; Coleman, Charl; Pieterson, Nadia; Cable, Russell; Welte, Alex; van den Berg, Karin; Vermeulen, Marion",Res Sq,https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-233375/v1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594353/,239

As part of the investigation into the mechanism of viral persistence, infection of glial cells, probable targets for chronic infection, was studied by the use of mixed glial, enriched oligodendrocyte and enriched astrocyte cultures. Following MHV-A59 infection in vitro, approximately 10% of oligodendrocytes and 30% of astrocytes expressed viral antigens in the absence of overt cytopathic effect. All cultures released infectious virus for the lifetime of the cultures, for at least 45 days in the case of mixed glial cultures. Cultures derived from previously infected mice were similar to those infected in vitro with respect to percentage of cells expressing viral antigen and levels of infectious virus produced. These results show (1) that glial cells are early sites of infection in vivo as well as sites of infection in in vitro cultures, and (2) that glial cells support a non-lytic but productive infection in vitro and thus may contribute to viral persistence in vivo.","Lavi, Ehud; Suzumura, Akio; Hirayama, Mikio; Highkin, Maureen K.; Dambach, Donna M.; Silberberg, Donald H.; Weiss, Susan R.",Microbial Pathogenesis,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0882401087900660; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2849019/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0882401087900660,239

DESIGN: Cross-sectional review. DATA SOURCES: Medline database. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Articles published from 1 January to 31 December 2020 in the seven leading general medical journals by impact factor. Article types included primary research, reviews, editorials and commentaries. DATA EXTRACTION: Key data elements were whether the study topic was related to COVID-19 and names of the principal and the senior authors. A hierarchical approach was used to determine the likely gender of authors. Logistic regression assessed the association of study characteristics, including COVID-19 status, with authors’ likely gender; this was quantified using adjusted ORs (aORs). RESULTS: We included 2252 articles, of which 748 (33.2%) were COVID-19-related and 1504 (66.8%) covered other topics. A likely gender was determined for 2138 (94.9%) principal authors and 1890 (83.9%) senior authors. Men were significantly more likely to be both principal (1364 men; 63.8%) and senior (1332 men; 70.5%) authors. COVID-19-related articles were not associated with the odds of men being principal (aOR 0.99; 95% CI 0.81 to 1.21; p=0.89) or senior authors (aOR 0.96; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.19; p=0.71) relative to other topics. Articles with men as senior authors were more likely to have men as principal authors (aOR 1.49; 95% CI 1.21 to 1.83; p<0.001). Men were more likely to author articles reporting original research and those with corresponding authors based outside the USA and Europe. CONCLUSIONS: Women were substantially under-represented as authors among articles in leading medical journals; this was not significantly different for COVID-19-related articles. Study limitations include potential for misclassification bias due to the name-based analysis. Results suggest that barriers to women’s authorship in high-impact journals during COVID-19 are not significantly larger than barriers that preceded the pandemic and that are likely to continue beyond it.

To prevent nonspecific binding events, blocking agents such as bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein, mixtures of proteins in media such as milk or serum, and/or surfactants are typically added to ELISA plates after probe attachment and before analyte capture. Herein, we developed a streamlined ELISA strategy in which readily prepared lipid nanoparticles are utilized as the blocking agent and are added together with the probe molecule to the ELISA plate, resulting in fewer processing steps, quicker protocol time, and superior detection performance compared to conventional BSA blocking. These measurement capabilities were established for coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) antibody detection in saline and human serum conditions and are broadly applicable for developing rapid ELISA diagnostics.","Yoon, Bo Kyeong; Sut, Tun Naw; Yoo, Ki Yeol; Lee, Seung Hwa; Hwang, Youngkyu; Jackman, Joshua A.; Cho, Nam-Joon",Appl Mater Today,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34395822/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352940721001931; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352940721001931; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apmt.2021.101128,239

The Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination program is the principal element of tuberculosis control in Japan. We investigated the impact of routine infant BCG vaccination on prevention of local COVID-19 spread. METHODS: Data on the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, annual routine infant BCG vaccine coverage (represented by the number of BCG vaccinations per live births), and other candidate factors in each prefecture were obtained from the official notifications database in Japan. We analysed the association of vaccine coverage with the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: The BCG vaccine coverage in 1999–2002, 2004, and 2012 in five prefectures with no COVID-19 infections was significantly higher than that in five prefectures with a high prevalence of infections (Mann-Whitney U test, p<0.05). The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was significantly negatively correlated with BCG vaccine coverage in 2004 and was significantly positively correlated with age groups 20–34 and 40–54 years (Spearman's rank correlation, p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that routine infant BCG vaccination coverage in young generation had a significant impact on prevention of local COVID-19 spread in Japan.","Kinoshita, Masako; Tanaka, Masami",J Infect,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.08.013; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445320305478?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445320305478; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32795481/,239

The presence of pathogens in the lower respiratory tract causes a vicious circle resulting in impaired mucociliary function, bronchial inflammation, and progressive lung injury. In current guidelines, antibiotic therapy has a key role in bronchiectasis management to treat acute exacerbations and chronic infection and to eradicate bacterial colonization. Contrastingly, antimicrobial resistance, with the risk of multidrug-resistant pathogen development, causes nowadays great concern. The aim of this literature review was to assess the role of antibiotic therapy in bronchiectasis patient management and possible concerns regarding antimicrobial resistance based on current evidence. The authors of this review stress the need to expand research regarding bronchiectasis with the aim to assess measures to reduce the rate of antimicrobial resistance worldwide.","Inchingolo, Riccardo; Pierandrei, Chiara; Montemurro, Giuliano; Smargiassi, Andrea; Lohmeyer, Franziska Michaela; Rizzi, Angela",Antibiotics (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33804631/; https://doi.org/10.3390/antibiotics10030326,239

The potential application of landscape genetics to infectious agents has garnered attention at formative stages in the development of landscape genetics, but systematic examination is lacking. We comprehensively review how landscape genetics is being used to better understand pathogen dynamics. We characterize the field and evaluate the types of questions addressed, approaches used and systems studied. We also review the now established landscape genetic methods and their realized and potential applications to disease ecology. Lastly, we identify emerging frontiers in the landscape genetic study of infectious agents, including recent phylogeographic approaches and frameworks for studying complex multihost and host‐vector systems. Our review emphasizes the expanding utility of landscape genetic methods available for elucidating key pathogen dynamics (particularly transmission and spread) and also how landscape genetic studies of pathogens can provide insight into host population dynamics.

Epidemiological status changes dynamically as the pandemy is far from ending. Several complications of presented virus may be similar to those observed in other viral infections. Despite lacking data, the heart involvement may be comparable to cardiac complications observed previously in those with SARS as well as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). In COVID-19 we observe elevated levels of cardiac biomarkers, such as natriuretic peptides, troponins, myoglobin, C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and ferritin, which is likely the result of myocardial injury. The possible mechanisms of cardiovascular injury include direct toxicity through the viral invasion of cardiac myocytes, ACE-2 receptor-mediated CV (cardiac and endothelial) injury, microvascular dysfunction and thrombosis and cytokine release syndrome (mainly IL-6 mediated). Cardiac manifestations of COVID-19 are focal or global myocardial inflammation, necrosis, ventricular dysfunction, heart failure and arrhythmia.","Bielecka-Dabrowa, Agata; Cichocka-Radwan, Anna; Lewek, Joanna; Pawliczak, Filip; Maciejewski, Marek; Banach, Maciej",Rev Cardiovasc Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34258904/; https://doi.org/10.31083/j.rcm2202043,239

Since then, the novel coronavirus started to be compared to influenza. The haematological parameters and inflammatory indexes are associated with severe illness in COVID-19 patients. In this study, the laboratory data of 120 COVID-19 patients, 100 influenza patients and 61 healthy controls were evaluated. Lower lymphocytes, eosinophils, basophils, platelets and higher delta neutrophil index (DNI), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) were found in COVID-19 and influenza groups compared to healthy controls. The eosinophils, lymphocytes and PLR made the highest contribution to differentiate COVID-19 patients from healthy controls (area under the curves (AUCs): 0.819, 0.817 and 0.716, respectively; P-value is <0.0001 for all). The NLR, the optimal cut-off value was 3.58, which resulted in a sensitivity of 30.8 and a specificity of 100 (AUC: 0.677, P < 0.0001). Higher leucocytes, neutrophils, DNI, NLR, PLR and lower lymphocytes, red blood cells, haemoglobin, haematocrit levels were found in severe patients at the end of treatment. Nonsevere patients showed an upward trend for lymphocytes, eosinophils and platelets, and a downward trend for neutrophils, DNI, NLR and PLR. However, there was an increasing trend for eosinophils, platelets and PLR in severe patients. In conclusion, NLR and PLR can be used as biomarkers to distinguish COVID-19 patients from healthy people and to predict the severity of COVID-19. The increasing value of PLR during follow-up may be more useful compared to NLR to predict the disease severity.","Kazancioglu, Sumeyye; Bastug, Aliye; Ozbay, Bahadir Orkun; Kemirtlek, Nizamettin; Bodur, Hurrem",Epidemiol Infect,https://doi.org/10.1017/s095026882000271x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33148349/,239

We aimed to explore the impact of coagulation dysfunction amongst patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Cochrane and Embase databases from December 1, 2019 to April 27, 2020 following Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines. Data about coagulation (Platelets, PT, APTT, fibrin, fibrinogen degradation products, D-dimer), prevalence of coagulation dysfunction and mortality were extracted. Meta regression was used to explore the heterogeneity. RESULTS: Sixteen observational studies were included, comprising 2, 139 patients with confirmed COVID-19. More severe COVID-19 cases tended to have higher mean D-dimer (SMD 0.78, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.03, P < .001). The similar pattern occurred with PT and fibrin, with a contrary trend for PLTs. Coagulation dysfunction was more frequent in severe cases compared to less severe (SMD 0.46, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.67, P < .001). Higher mortality was associated with COVID-19-related coagulopathy (RR 10.86, 2.86 to 41.24, P < .001). Prevalence of ARDS was increased in more severe patients than less severe cases (RR 16.52, 11.27 to 24.22, P < .001). PT, fibrin and D-dimer levels elevated significantly in non-survivors during hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Presence of coagulation dysfunction might be associated with COVID-19 severity, and coagulopathy might be associated with mortality. Coagulation markers including PT, fibrin and D-dimer may imply the progression of COVID-19. This illuminates the necessity of effectively monitoring coagulation function for preventing COVID-19-related coagulopathy, especially in severe patients. For the obvious heterogeneity, the quality of the evidence is compromised. Future rigorous randomized controlled trials that assess the correlation between coagulation and COVID-19 are needed.

Inverse design concept uses the desired enclosed environment as the design objective and inversely determines the systems required to achieve the objective. This paper discusses a number of backward and forward methods for inverse design. Backward methods, such as the quasi-reversibility method, pseudo-reversibility method, and regularized inverse matrix method, can be used to identify contaminant sources in an enclosed environment. However, these methods cannot be used to inversely design a desired indoor environment. Forward methods, such as the CFD-based adjoint method, CFD-based genetic algorithm method, and proper orthogonal decomposition method, show the promise in the inverse design of airflow and heat transfer in an enclosed environment. The CFD-based adjoint method is accurate and can handle many design parameters without increasing computing costs, but the method may find a locally optimal design that could meet the design objective with constrains. The CFD-based genetic algorithm method, on the other hand, can provide the global optimal design that can meet the design objective without constraints, but the computing cost can increase dramatically with the number of design parameters. The proper orthogonal decomposition method is a reduced-order method that can significantly lower computing costs, but at the expense of reduced accuracy. This paper also discusses the possibility to reduce the computing costs of CFD-based design methods.","Liu, Wei; Zhang, Tengfei; Xue, Yu; Zhai, Zhiqiang (John); Wang, Jihong; Wei, Yun; Chen, Qingyan",Build Environ,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2015.02.041; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132315001183; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360132315001183; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288031/,239

Unfortunately, there is no specific prevention and treatment strategy for this disease. We aim to explore the potential role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in this regard through this literature review. As a crucial enzyme of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), ACE2 not only mediates the virus entry but also affects the pathophysiological process of virus-induced acute lung injury (ALI), as well as other organs’ damage. As interaction of COVID-19 virus spike and ACE2 is essential for virus infection, COVID-19-specific vaccine based on spike protein, small molecule compound interrupting their interaction, human monoclonal antibody based on receptor-binding domain, and recombinant human ACE2 protein (rhuACE2) have aroused the interests of researchers. Meanwhile, ACE2 could catalyze angiotensin II (Ang II) to form angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7), thus alleviates the harmful effect of Ang II and amplifies the protection effect of Ang1-7. ACE inhibitor and angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) have been shown to increase the level of expression of ACE2 and could be potential strategies in protecting lungs, heart, and kidneys. ACE2 plays a very important role in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of COVID-19 infection. Strategies targeting ACE2 and its ligand, COVID-19 virus spike protein, may provide novel method in the prevention and management of novel coronavirus pneumonia.","Liu, Mengyuan; Wang, Ting; Zhou, Yun; Zhao, Yutong; Zhang, Yan; Li, Jianping",J Transl Int Med,https://doi.org/10.2478/jtim-2020-0003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32435607/,239

COVID-19 is a prothrombotic disease, characterized by both arterial and venous thrombosis. The pathogenesis of coagulopathy in COVID-19 is multifactorial, with activation of endothelial cells, platelets, neutrophils, and other immune system effectors playing crucial roles. High levels of von Willebrand factor (VWF) and reduced levels of ADAMTS13 have been observed in COVID-19, sepsis, and immunothrombotic states, and an elevated VWF/ADAMTS13 ratio has been previously described in ischemic stroke1. In this study, we sought to evaluate potential associations of VWF activity and antigen ratios to ADAMTS13 with clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and to compare these ratios with other cytokines and markers of inflammation in critical illness. METHODS. Institutional Review Board approval was obtained for this study. Blood was collected from 49 hospitalized patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 between April 13 and April 24, 2020, which included 40 patients in an intensive care unit and 9 on a non-ICU unit. Medical records were reviewed, and patient characteristics including age, sex, comorbidities, pertinent medications, imaging studies, history of arterial or venous thrombosis, and other pertinent patient information were compiled. Blood was collected in sodium citrate tubes and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 minutes, with the resulting plasma supernatant used for further testing. Measurements of VWF antigen and VWF activity were performed on an ACL TOP machine using our institution’s standard clinical laboratory protocol. Biomarker profiling analyses were performed at Eve Technologies (Calgary, Alberta, Canada). Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism (v8.4.3, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) and R (v4, R Core Team, 2020). P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS. The median age was 64 years; 36 (73%) were male, 11 (22.4%), 29 (59.2%), and 9 (18.4%) had BMI<25, between 25 and 40, and >40 kg/m2, respectively. The ratio of VWF activity/ADAMTS13 was significantly higher in patients with higher BMI (median [interquartile range, IQR] VWF activity/ADAMTS13 ratios: 0.66 [0.39-0.88] for BMI<25 kg/m2, 0.865 [0.769-1.102] for BMI 25-40 kg/m2, and 1.041 [0.747-2.032] for BMI>40 kg/m2; p = 0.0408, Kruskal-Wallis test). In patients who required mechanical ventilation, median [IQR] VWF activity/ADAMTS13 was 0.876 [0.75-1.769] vs 0.792 [0.566-0.932] for those who did not (p = 0.0497, Mann-Whitney U-test). The difference for the VWF antigen/ADAMTS13 ratio was more pronounced, 1.32 [0.991-2.456] vs 0.981 [0.628-1.162] (p = 0.0045, Mann-Whitney U-test). There was also a significant correlation between both VWF activity/ADAMTS13 and VWF antigen/ADAMTS13 ratios and neutrophil indices such as absolute neutrophil count (R = 0.57, p <0.0001 and R = 0.54, p = 0.0001, respectively) and neutrophil to lymphocyte count (R = 0.6, p <0.0001 and R = 0.57, p <0.0001, respectively). We also found significant correlations of these ratios with markers of neutrophils activation (HGF, resistin, and lipocalin-2; Figure 1). CONCLUSIONS. Ratios VWF activity/ADAMTS13 and VWF antigen/ADAMTS13 are elevated in patients with more severe COVID-19 disease and correlate with markers of neutrophils activation. These findings and that azurophillic granules in neutrophils contain α-defensins implicated in thrombosis2 suggest possible mechanistic links among VWF, ADAMTS13, contact pathway, and neutrophil function in mediating immunothrombotic complications in COVID-19, which might highlight potential therapeutic targets to attenuate the severity of coagulopathy and merit further investigation with a larger cohort of patients.

624120,Objective evaluation and predictive value of olfactory dysfunction among patients hospitalized with COVID-19,2021-01-23,"Abstract Currently MedImmune manufactures cold-adapted (ca) live, attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) from specific-pathogen free (SPF) chicken eggs. Difficulties in production scale-up and potential exposure of chicken flocks to avian influenza viruses especially in the event of a pandemic influenza outbreak have prompted evaluation and development of alternative non-egg based influenza vaccine manufacturing technologies. As part of MedImmune's effort to develop the live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) using cell culture production technologies we have investigated the use of high yielding, cloned MDCK cells as a substrate for vaccine production by assessing host range and virus replication of influenza virus produced from both SPF egg and MDCK cell production technologies. In addition to cloned MDCK cells the indicator cell lines used to evaluate the impact of producing LAIV in cells on host range and replication included two human cell lines: human lung carcinoma (A549) cells and human muco-epidermoid bronchiolar carcinoma (NCI H292) cells. The influenza viruses used to infect the indicators cell lines represented both the egg and cell culture manufacturing processes and included virus strains that composed the 2006–2007 influenza seasonal trivalent vaccine (A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1), A/Wisconsin/67/05 (H3N2) and B/Malaysia/2506/04). Results from this study demonstrate remarkable similarity between influenza viruses representing the current commercial egg produced and developmental MDCK cell produced vaccine production platforms. MedImmune's high yielding cloned MDCK cells used for the cell culture based vaccine production were highly permissive to both egg and cell produced ca attenuated influenza viruses. Both the A549 and NCI H292 cells regardless of production system were less permissive to influenza A and B viruses than the MDCK cells. Irrespective of the indicator cell line used the replication properties were similar between egg and the cell produced influenza viruses. Based on these study results we conclude that the MDCK cell produced and egg produced vaccine strains are highly comparable.","Hussain, Althaf I.; Cordeiro, Melissa; Sevilla, Elizabeth; Liu, Jonathan",Vaccine,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X10003415; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2010.03.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X10003415; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20307595/,239
624300,A nomogram for use of non-invasive respiratory strategies in COVID-19,2021-02-08,"SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) is the pathogenic coronavirus responsible for the global pandemic of COVID-19 disease. The Spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 attaches to host lung epithelial cells through the cell surface receptor ACE2, a process dependent on host proteases including TMPRSS2. Here, we identify small molecules that reduce surface expression of TMPRSS2 using a library of 2,560 FDA-approved or current clinical trial compounds. We identify homoharringtonine and halofuginone as the most attractive agents, reducing endogenous TMPRSS2 expression at sub-micromolar concentrations. These effects appear to be mediated by a drug-induced alteration in TMPRSS2 protein stability. We further demonstrate that halofuginone modulates TMPRSS2 levels through proteasomal-mediated degradation that involves the E3 ubiquitin ligase component DDB1- and CUL4-associated factor 1 (DCAF1). Finally, cells exposed to homoharringtonine and halofuginone, at concentrations of drug known to be achievable in human plasma, demonstrate marked resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection in both live and pseudoviral in vitro models. Given the safety and pharmacokinetic data already available for the compounds identified in our screen, these results should help expedite the rational design of human clinical trials designed to combat active COVID-19 infection.","Chen, Yanwen; Lear, Travis B.; Evankovich, John W.; Larsen, Mads B.; Lin, Bo; Alfaras, Irene; Kennerdell, Jason R.; Salminen, Laura; Camarco, Daniel P.; Lockwood, Karina C.; Tuncer, Ferhan; Liu, Jie; Myerburg, Michael M.; McDyer, John F.; Liu, Yuan; Finkel, Toren; Chen, Bill B.",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34162861/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-24156-y,239

624717,Contrasting factors associated with COVID-19-related ICU and death outcomes: interpretable multivariable analyses of the UK CHESS dataset.,2020-12-07,"Summary The beauty of microarray analysis of gene expression (MAGE) is that it can be used to discover some genes that were previously thought to be unrelated to a physiologic or pathologic event. During the period from 1999 to 2007, applications of MAGE in cancer investigation have shifted from molecular profiling, identifying previously undiscovered cancer types, predicting outcomes of cancer patients, revealing metastasis signatures of solid tumors, to guiding the use of therapeutics. The roles of cancer genomic signatures have evolved through three phases. In the first phase, genomic signatures were described in stored cancer specimens and dubbed as molecular portraits of cancer. When gene expression profiles were carefully correlated with sufficient clinical information of cancer patients, new subgroups of cancers with distinct outcomes were revealed. In studies of the second phase, validation of cancer signatures was emphasized and commonly performed with independent groups of cancer specimens or independent data set. In the third phase, cancer genomic signatures have been further expanded beyond depicting the molecular portrait of cancer to predicting patient outcomes and guiding the use of cancer therapeutics. Cancer genomic signatures have become an essential part of a new generation of cancer clinical trials. It is advocated that, in future clinical trials of cancer therapy, the cancer specimens of each participant should be tested for currently available predictor genomic signatures, so that the most effective treatment with the least adverse effects for each patient can be identified. Then, participants can be triaged to an appropriate study group.","Wang, Tzu-Hao; Chao, Angel",Taiwanese Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17962100/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1028455908600248; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1028455908600248,239
624929,Breathing problems and COVID‐19 in patients with developmental disabilities,2020-08-03,"The human infection caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 is a public health emergency of international concern. Although the disease associated to this virus, named COVID-19, mainly affects the lungs, the infection can spread to extrapulmonary tissues, causing multiorgan involvement in severely ill patients. The broad infective capacity of SARS-CoV-2 is related to the pattern of expression of the viral entry factors ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in human tissues. As such, the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts are at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection due to their high expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, which explains the clinical phenotype described in the vast majority of infected patients that includes pneumonia and diarrhea. Recently, preoccupation about the potential of the virus to infect the skin has been raised by dermatologists due to the increasing observations of cutaneous manifestations in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although there is little evidence of the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the normal skin, the dermatological findings observed among COVID-19 patients warrants further investigation to delineate the mechanisms of skin affection after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we provide a summary of the dermatological findings observed among patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection based on recent reports. In addition, we analyze possible mechanisms of skin injury in COVID-19 patients and discuss about the risk of individuals with chronic skin conditions for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The present review constitutes a useful informative tool to improve our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of COVID-19 and the possible implications of the current pandemic in dermatology.","Garduño-Soto, Myriam; Choreño-Parra, Jose Alberto; Cazarin-Barrientos, Jorge",Arch Dermatol Res,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00403-020-02156-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33159236/,239

625673,The 12-Lead ECG in COVID-19: QT Prolongation Predicts Outcome,2021-08-16,"Genome sequencing is a key strategy in the surveillance of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Latin America is the hardest hit region of the world, accumulating almost 20% of COVID-19 cases worldwide. Costa Rica was first exemplary for the region in its pandemic control, declaring a swift state of emergency on March 16th that led to a low quantity of cases, until measures were lifted in early May. From the first detected case in March 6th to December 31st almost 170 000 cases have been reported in Costa Rica, 99.5% of them from May onwards. We analyzed the genomic variability during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Costa Rica using 185 sequences, 52 from the first months of the pandemic, and 133 from the current wave. Three GISAID clades (G, GH, and GR) and three PANGOLIN lineages (B.1, B.1.1, and B.1.291) are predominant, with phylogenetic relationships that are in line with the results of other Latin American countries, suggesting introduction and multiple re-introductions from other regions of the world. The whole-genome variant calling analysis identified a total of 283 distinct nucleotide variants. These correspond mostly to non-synonymous mutations (51.6%, 146) but 45.6% (129) corresponded to synonymous mutations. The 283 variants showed an expected power-law distribution: 190 single nucleotide mutations were identified in single sequences, only 16 single nucleotide mutations were found in >5% sequences, and only two mutations in >50% genomes. These mutations were distributed through the whole genome. However, 63.6% were present in ORF1ab, 11.7% in Spike gene and 10.6% in the Nucleocapsid gene. Additionally, the prevalence of worldwide-found variant D614G in the Spike (98.9% in Costa Rica), ORF8 L84S (1.1%) is similar to what is found elsewhere. Interestingly, the frequency of mutation T1117I in the Spike has increased during the current pandemic wave beginning in May 2020 in Costa Rica, reaching 29.2% detection in the full genome analyses in November 2020. This variant has been observed in less than 1% of the GISAID reported sequences worldwide in all the 2020. Structural modeling of the Spike protein with the T1117I mutation suggest a potential effect on the viral oligomerization needed for cell infection, but no differences with other genomes on transmissibility, severity nor vaccine effectiveness are predicted. Nevertheless, in-vitro experiments are required to support these in-silico findings. In conclusion, genome analyses of the SARS-CoV-2 sequences over the course of COVID-19 pandemic in Costa Rica suggest introduction of lineages from other countries as travel bans and measures were lifted, similar to results found in other studies, as well as an increase in the Spike-T1117I variant that needs to be monitored and studied in further analyses as part of the surveillance program during the pandemic.","Molina-Mora, Jose Arturo; Cordero-Laurent, Estela; Godínez, Adriana; Calderón-Osorno, Melany; Brenes, Hebleen; Soto-Garita, Claudio; Pérez-Corrales, Cristian; Drexler, Jan Felix; Moreira-Soto, Andres; Corrales-Aguilar, Eugenia; Duarte-Martínez, Francisco",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.21.423850,239
626299,An Economic Analysis of the Impact of Homecare Drug Administration for Biologic Interventions Available for Plaque Psoriasis in the UK,2021-07-23,"INTRODUCTION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals have faced unprecedented events, which are often stressful. Stress has an important impact on dreams, and stress-induced sleep difficulties may also impact dream recall. The present study evaluated associations between sleep, stress and dream content on dream recall during the pandemic. METHODS: A sample of N=419 US adults completed online surveys about sleep and COVID-19 experiences. Participants were asked if they remember more, fewer or about the same amount of dreams as before the pandemic. They were also asked whether the pandemic was associated with more stress, a more regular schedule, improved sleep, worse sleep, more early insomnia, more middle-of-the-night insomnia, more sleepiness, and more naps. They also completed the Insomnia Severity Index, Fatigue Severity Scale, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Brief Index of Sleep Control, Assessment of Sleep Environment, GAD-7 anxiety scale, and PHQ9 depression scale. Multinomial logistic regressions examined correlates of increased or decreased recall (versus same), adjusted for age, sex, and race/ethnicity. RESULTS: Those who experienced greater schedule regularity were less likely to report decreased recall (RRR=0.50,p<0.0005), as were those who reported sleep improvement (RRR=0.48,p=0.006). Those whose sleep worsened were more likely to report both increased (RRR=1.64,p=0.003) and decreased (RRR=2.16,p<0.0005) recall. Those suffering maintenance insomnia were more likely to report both increased (RRR=1.70,p=0.001) and decreased (RRR=2.68,p<0.0005) recall, as did those who reported more daytime sleepiness (Increased RRR=1.57,p=0.006; Decreased RRR=1.94,p=0.001). Those whose dream content was more negative were more likely to report both increased (RRR=4.05,p<0.005) and decreased (RRR=3.35,p<0.0005) recall, as did those who reported less negative content (Increased RRR=4.20,p<0.0005; Decreased RRR=5.05,p<0.0005). Similarly, those who reported more positive dream content reported both increased (RRR=17.37,p<0.0005) and decreased (RRR=7.14,p=0.02) recall, as did those who reported less positive content (Increased RRR=4.49,p<0.0005; Decreased RRR=5.59,p<0.0005). Less recall was associated with greater insomnia severity (RRR=1.08,p=0.001), fatigue (RRR=1.04,p=0.001), sleepiness (RRR=1.09,p=0.01), COVID stress (RRR=1.67,p=0.03), anxiety (RRR=1.08,p=0.01), and depression (RRR=1.06,p=0.007), worse sleep environment (RRR=1.06,p=0.005), and less sleep control (RRR=0.56,p=0.001). CONCLUSION: The results of this survey suggest that a sudden decrease in dream recall in reaction to a new stress could be considered as a pejorative indicator regarding sleep quality and mental health.

627512,The Impact of COVID-19 on Emergency General Surgery Admissions and Operative Volumes: A Single Centre Experience,2020-11-19,"BACKGROUND: Oral diseases are a public health concern with a significant impact on the quality of life of individuals. Children with special needs face significant challenges in carrying out oral hygiene due to their disability, and they are more prone to poor oral health and illnesses. This study assessed dental health problems and treatment-seeking behaviors of special needs school students in Amhara region, Ethiopia. METHODS: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from November 2020 to April 2021, in eight special needs schools located in the Amhara Regional State, Ethiopia. A total of 443 randomly selected special needs students were included. Data were collected using a structured interview-administered questionnaire. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to identify factors associated with oral health problems and treatment-seeking behavior. A p-value of less than 0.05 was used to declare statistical significance. RESULTS: The prevalence of self-reported dental health problems and treatment-seeking behaviors among special needs school students was 46.1% (95% CI: 41.4%, 50.7%) and 60.3% (95% CI: 53.4%, 66.8%), respectively. Place of residence, grade level, religious affiliation, years lived with disability, and knowledge of dental health-related risk behaviors were associated with dental health problems. Whereas, place of residence, being hearing impaired, and having prior information about dental health problems were associated with dental treatment-seeking behavior. CONCLUSIONS: A significant number of special needs students reported dental problems and about 40% of them did not seek dental treatment. Oral hygiene practice and access to dental care services are important in the prevention of dental problems. Hence, oral hygiene promotion programs focusing on oral hygiene practice and dental treatment services are needed in special needs schools. It is also strongly suggested to incorporate oral health related information in health-related academic lessons to enhance optimum oral health among special needs students.","Tefera, Amare Teshome; Girma, Biruk; Adane, Aynishet; Muche, Abebe; Ayele, Tadesse Awoke; Getahun, Kefyalew Ayalew; Aniley, Zelallem; Ali, Semira; Handebo, Simegnew",BMC Oral Health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12903-021-01856-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34600520/,239

All too often in such times, scant attention is paid to what’s between the top line and the bottom line of the income statement. Worse, most business owners, in my experience, give little more than a cursory nod to the balance sheet. Why does this matter? When a recession lands on their doorstep with a sudden thud, as it apparently just has, many of these same people will find themselves having sailed too close to the wind, with cash running out and a dearth of tools to help them weather the storm and understand what has gone wrong. But it need not be so, for there are four simple tools to help any business owner answer these four important questions: (1) Where is cash going in my business, and where is it coming from? (2) To what extent are my profit margins improving or declining, and why? (3) To what extent am I effectively managing the cash-flow relationships with my customers and my suppliers? (4) What, if anything, can I do to better manage the cash that flows into and out of my business?

South Africa went into a national lockdown in March 2020 to mitigate the impact of the virus. This included a ban on the sales of tobacco and electronic cigarette products. The ban has been a highly contentious issue in South Africa, discussed worldwide, which has drawn many criticisms. The prevalence rate of smoking in South Africa was around 21.5%, with the Western Cape province having a prevalence rate of 39%. We compared the number of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) presentations at a large regional referral hospital in the Western Cape province from January to August 2019 with the same period in 2020. Electronic emergency centre data showed a reduction of 69.28% in COPD presentations. To control for some confounders for the same period, we also reviewed patients presenting with urinary tract infections, which showed only a 30.60% reduction. This notable reduction in COPD presentations reduced service pressure of emergency centre and most likely benefitted patients’ health.

Summary The University Hospitals of Geneva is the largest hospital complex in Switzerland and is coupled to the Faculty of medicine of the University of Geneva. The division of adult intensive care is a 32-bed mixed medical and surgical ICU, made of three different units: one neurocritical care unit, one cardiovascular unit, and one polyvalent unit receiving patients that do not fit into the two previous units. More than 2200 patients are hospitalised yearly in the division of adult intensive care, staying a mean of 4 days. The ICU mortality rate is 7.5% for a mean SAPS2 of 44 points. A fourth non-geographical unit with dedicated doctors and nurses is dedicated to the specific needs of “long-stayers” and their next of kin and to the organisation of post-ICU clinics, 6 and 12 months after ICU discharge. Nurses follow a special ICU training of 2 years, and obtain an ICU nurse certificate. One nurse takes care of 1.5 patients during the day and 2 patients during night shifts. The ICU division is a training centre for doctors to become intensivists and a centre for quality clinical research.","Pugin, Jérôme",Anesthésie & Réanimation,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352580020300034; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352580020300034,239
629525,Development and validation of the COVID-19 severity index (CSI): a prognostic tool for early respiratory decompensation,2020-05-12,"INTRODUCTION: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a reduction in emergency department (ED) visits was seen nationally according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, no data currently exists for the impact of ED transfers to a higher level of care during this same time period. The primary objective of the study was to determine whether the COVID-19 pandemic affected the rate of non-COVID-19 transfers from a rural community ED. METHODS: We completed a retrospective chart review of all ED patients who presented to Kingman Regional Medical Center in Kingman, Arizona, from March 1–June 31, 2019 and March 1–June 31, 2020. To ensure changes were not due to seasonal trends, we examined transfer rates from the same four-month period in 2019 and 2020. Patients were included in the study if they were transferred to an outside facility for a higher level of care not related to COVID-19. RESULTS: Between the time periods studied there was a 25.33% (P = 0.001) reduction in total ED volume and a 21.44% (P = 0.009) reduction in ED transfers to a higher level of care. No statistical difference was noted in ED transfer volume following adjustment for decreased ED volumes. Transfers for gastroenterology (45%; P = 0.021), neurosurgery (29.2%; P = 0.029), neurology (76.3%; P < 0.001), trauma (37.5%; P = 0.039), urology (41.8%; P = 0.012), and surgery (56.3%; P = 0.028) all experienced a decrease in transfer rates during the time period studied. When gender was considered, males exhibited an increased rate of transfers to psychiatric facilities (P = 0.018). CONCLUSION: Significant reductions in both ED volume and transfers have coincided with the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further research is needed to determine how the current pandemic has affected patient care.","Lee, Stephen; Santarelli, Anthony; Choi, Heesun; Ashurst, John",West J Emerg Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34125027/; https://doi.org/10.5811/westjem.2021.3.50907,239
630489,"Logistics management provides greater efficiency, governance and compliance",2021-06-13,"Background and Aims: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) increases hyperinflammatory state, leading to acute lung damage, hyperglycemia, vascular endothelial damage, and a higher mortality rate. Metformin is a first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes and is known to have anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. Previous studies have shown that metformin use is associated with decreased risk of mortality among patients with COVID-19; however, the results are still inconclusive. This study investigated the association between metformin and the risk of mortality among diabetes patients with COVID-19. Methods: Data were collected from online databases such as PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of Science, and reference from the most relevant articles. The search and collection of relevant articles was carried out between 1 February 2020, and 20 June 2021. Two independent reviewers extracted information from selected studies. The random-effects model was used to estimate risk ratios (RRs), with a 95% confidence interval. Results: A total of 16 studies met all inclusion criteria. Diabetes patients given metformin had a significantly reduced risk of mortality (RR, 0.65; 95% CI: 0.54–0.80, p < 0.001, heterogeneity I(2) = 75.88, Q = 62.20, and τ(2) = 0.06, p < 0.001) compared with those who were not given metformin. Subgroup analyses showed that the beneficial effect of metformin was higher in the patients from North America (RR, 0.43; 95% CI: 0.26–0.72, p = 0.001, heterogeneity I(2) = 85.57, Q = 34.65, τ(2) = 0.31) than in patients from Europe (RR, 0.67; 95% CI: 0.47–0.94, p = 0.02, heterogeneity I(2) = 82.69, Q = 23.11, τ(2) = 0.10) and Asia (RR, 0.90; 95% CI: 0.43–1.86, p = 0.78, heterogeneity I(2) = 64.12, Q = 11.15, τ(2) = 0.40). Conclusions: This meta-analysis shows evidence that supports the theory that the use of metformin is associated with a decreased risk of mortality among diabetes patients with COVID-19. Randomized control trials with a higher number of participants are warranted to assess the effectiveness of metformin for reducing the mortality of COVID-19 patients.","Poly, Tahmina Nasrin; Islam, Md.

631011,Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Acute General Surgical Admissions in a District General Hospital in the United Kingdom: A Retrospective Cohort Study,2020-08-12,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about pathogen-specific humoral immunity after chimeric antigen receptor–modified T (CAR-T) cell therapy for B cell malignancies. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cross-sectional study of CD19-targeted or B cell maturation antigen–targeted (BCMA-targeted) CAR-T cell therapy recipients at least 6 months posttreatment and in remission. We measured pathogen-specific IgG against 12 vaccine-preventable infections and the number of viral and bacterial epitopes to which IgG was detected (“epitope hits”) using a serological profiling assay. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with IgG levels above a threshold correlated with seroprotection for vaccine-preventable infections. RESULTS: We enrolled 65 children and adults a median of 20 months after CD19- (n = 54) or BCMA- (n = 11) CAR-T cell therapy. Among 30 adults without IgG replacement therapy (IGRT) in the prior 16 weeks, 27 (90%) had hypogammaglobulinemia. These individuals had seroprotection to a median of 67% (IQR, 59%–73%) of tested infections. Proportions of participants with seroprotection per pathogen were comparable to population-based studies, but most individuals lacked seroprotection to specific pathogens. Compared with CD19-CAR-T cell recipients, BCMA-CAR-T cell recipients were half as likely to have seroprotection (prevalence ratio, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.18–1.25) and had fewer pathogen-specific epitope hits (mean difference, –90 epitope hits; 95% CI, –157 to –22). CONCLUSION: Seroprotection for vaccine-preventable infections in adult CD19-CAR-T cell recipients was comparable to the general population. BCMA-CAR-T cell recipients had fewer pathogen-specific antibodies. Deficits in both groups support the need for vaccine and immunoglobulin replacement therapy studies.

In May, 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional seroprevalence study of IgG antibodies for nucleocapsid of SARS-CoV-2 among the residents of Blaine County, Idaho, a ski resort community with high COVID-19 attack rates in late March and Early April (2.9% for ages 18 and older). Participants were selected from volunteers who registered via a secure web link, using prestratification weighting to the population distribution by age and gender within each ZIP Code. Participants completed a survey reporting their demographics and symptoms; 88% of volunteers who were invited to participate completed data collection survey and had 10 ml of blood drawn. Serology was completed via the Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG immunoassay. Primary analyses estimated seroprevalence and 95% credible intervals (CI) using a hierarchical Bayesian framework to account for diagnostic uncertainty. Stratified models were run by age, sex, ZIP Code, ethnicity, employment status, and a priori participant-reported COVID-19 status. Sensitivity analyses to estimate seroprevalence included base models with post-stratification for ethnicity, age, and sex, with or without adjustment for multi-participant households. IgG antibodies to the virus that causes COVID-19 were found among 22.7% (95% CI: 20.1%, 25.5%) of residents of Blaine County. Higher levels of antibodies were found among residents of the City of Ketchum 34.8% (95% CI 29.3%, 40.5%), compared to Hailey 16.8% (95%CI 13.7%, 20.3%) and Sun Valley 19.4% (95% 11.8%, 28.4%). People who self-identified as not believing they had COVID-19 had the lowest prevalence 4.8% (95% CI 2.3%, 8.2%). The range of seroprevalence after correction for potential selection bias was 21.9% to 24.2%. This study suggests more than 80% of SARS-CoV-2 infections were not reported. Although Blaine County had high levels of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the community is not yet near the herd immunity threshold.","McLaughlin, Colleen C.; Doll, Margaret K.; Morrison, Kathryn T.; McLaughlin, William L.; O’Connor, Terry; Sholukh, Anton M.; Bossard, Emily L.; Phasouk, Khamsone; Ford, Emily S.; Diem, Kurt; Klock, Alexis M.; Jerome, Keith R.; Corey, Lawrence",medRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.19.20157198; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32743610/; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.19.20157198v1?rss=1,239
631406,Fear of COVID‐19 and stigmatization towards infected people among Jordanian people,2020-12-18,"Literature points to cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) as evidence-based therapies for trauma-related disorders. Treatments are typically administered in a vis-à-vis setting with patients reporting symptoms of a previously experienced trauma. Conversely, online-therapies and ongoing trauma have not received adequate attention. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of two brief treatments for health professionals and individuals suffering from the circumstances imposed by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The EMDR and the trauma focused-CBT were administered online during the earliest stage of distress to manage the ongoing trauma associated to quarantine or disease. Thirty-eight patients satisfying the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria for acute stress disorder were randomly assigned to the EMDR or CBT treatment. Both groups received a 7-session therapy, and psychometric tests were administered before, after the treatment and at one-month follow-up to assess traumatic symptoms, depression and anxiety. Results revealed that both treatments reduced anxiety by 30%, and traumatic and depressive symptoms by 55%. Present findings indicate the internet-based EMDR and CBT as equally effective brief treatments, also suggesting a maintenance of the effects as indicated by the follow-up evaluation. The EMDR and CBT might be considered as first line therapies to treat the ongoing trauma and to prevent the sensitization and accumulation of trauma memories.","Perri, Rinaldo Livio; Castelli, Paola; La Rosa, Cecilia; Zucchi, Teresa; Onofri, Antonio",Brain Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33946179/; https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci11050579,239

The quarantine and social distancing measures due to Covid-19 imposed in most countries and particularly in Cyprus, aim to isolate individuals from direct contact with others. This has resulted in vulnerable older people being isolated at their places of residence for several months, while the recommendations for continuing lockdowns do not appear to be ending. The risk of death from causes other than those related to Covid-19 increases in such individuals and it is due to the effects of social isolation. We estimate that in the next years, there will be a significant increase in the death numbers of such older people in Cyprus. The health authorities must develop a program of support for these older individuals to include medical, social, physical, and psychological elements. Examples of such support are given here.","Kyriazis, Marios; Mikellides, George; Pantelidakis, Heraklis; Polycarpou, Marina; Panayiotou, Barnabas",Front Med (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34409055/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.717692,239

635059,Efficacy and Safety of Antibiotic Agents in Children with COVID-19: A Rapid Review,2020-04-17,"OBJECTIVE: During the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), health care workers are innovating patient care and safety measures. Unfortunately, many of these are not properly tested for efficacy. The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of the novel COVID-19 Airway Management Isolation Chamber (CAMIC) to contain and evacuate particulate. STUDY DESIGN: Multi-institutional proof-of-concept study. SETTING: Two academic institutions: Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC) and Madigan Army Medical Center (MAMC). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Smoke, saline nebulizer, and simulated working port models were developed to assess the efficacy of the CAMIC to contain and remove ultrafine particles. Particulate counts were collected at set time intervals inside and outside the system. RESULTS: With the CAMIC on, smoke particulate counts inside the chamber significantly decreased over time: r(18) = −0.88, P < .001, WRNMMC; r(18) = −0.91, P < .001, MAMC. Similarly, saline nebulizer particulate counts inside the chamber significantly decreased over time: r(23) = −0.82, P < .001, WRNMMC; r(23) = −0.70, P < .001, MAMC. In the working port model, particulate counts inside the chamber significantly decreased over time: r(23) = −0.95, P < .001, WRNMMC; r(23) = −0.85, P < .001, MAMC. No significant leak was detected in the smoke, saline nebulizer, or working port model when the CAMIC was turned on. CONCLUSIONS: The CAMIC system appears to provide a barrier that actively removes particles from within the chamber and limits egress. Further studies are necessary to determine clinical applicability. The CAMIC may serve as an adjunct to improve health care worker safety and patient outcomes.","Blood, Timothy C.; Perkins, Jonathan N.; Wistermayer, Paul R.; Krivda, Joseph S.; Fisher, Nathan T.; Riley, Charles A.; Ruhl, Douglas S.; Hong, Steven S.",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32662735/; https://doi.org/10.1177/0194599820942500,239

635633,Estimation of the net reproductive number of COVID-19 in Iran,2020-04-15,"Although pandemics are rare, planning and preparation for responding to them plays a crucial role in preventing their spread. The management and control of pandemics such as COVID-19 relies heavily on a country's health capacity. Measuring vulnerability to pandemics in geographical areas could potentially delay a pandemic's exponential growth and reduce the number of cases, which would alleviate the disease impact on communities and the health care sector. The aim of this study is to generate an area-level COVID-19 Pandemic Vulnerability Index (CPVI) and to assess its correlation with COVID-19 cases. Data were collected for Local Government Areas (LGAs) across Australia from different sources including Australia Bureau of Statistics, Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, and General Transit Feed Specification. Based on recent official reports about the COVID-19 outbreak, 18 factors were identified as influencing vulnerability to the disease within LGAs. Using factor analysis, four latent factors were identified and named as sociodemographic, medical conditions, transportation, and land use. Predicted factor scores were summed to generate a CPVI for each LGA. The CPVI was evaluated by correlating with confirmed cases of COVID-19 standardised by adult population in New South Wales and Victoria, the two Australian states with the highest numbers of confirmed cases. There was a statistically significant correlation between the CPVI and COVID-19 in New South Wales (r = 0.49) and Victoria (r = 0.48). LGAs scoring higher on the CPVI also had a higher absolute number of cases. The CPVI could be used by policymakers to identify at-risk areas and to develop preparedness and response plans to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and future pandemics.","Saghapour, Tayebeh; Giles-Corti, Billie; Jafari, Afshin; Qaisrani, Muhammad Arif; Turrell, Gavin",Health Place,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1353829221001258; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthplace.2021.102629; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1353829221001258; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34303129/,239

Otherwise, under the opposite conditions, the R&D innovation effort subsidy should be selected. Furthermore, from an evolutionary game theoretical perspective, we also present the stability performance for the subsidies, and the results show that when the manufacturer’s innovation cost coefficient is relatively low, the more profitable per-unit production subsidy may be abandoned due to its performance instability.","Xie, Lei; Hou, Pengwen; Han, Hongshuai",Transp Res E Logist Transp Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33551663/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1366554520308620; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1366554520308620; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tre.2020.102220,239

Comparisons are conducted after attending to comparability of the loneliness measure between countries based on tests for discriminatory capacity and differential item functioning of the 3-item UCLA Loneliness Scale. Cross-sectional data from the 2015-16 wave of the National Social Life, Health and Aging Project (NSHAP) and the 2014-2015 wave of the English Longitudinal Study on Ageing (ELSA) were analyzed using graded item response models and multiple indicators and multiple causes (MIMIC) models. Risk factors included demographic variables, health characteristics, and social characteristics that were harmonized across surveys. Because of differences in the racial-ethnic composition of the U.S. and England, analyses were limited to white respondents (N=2,624 in NSHAP; N=6,639 in ELSA). Only respondents born 1925-1965 were included in analyses. Discriminatory capacity was evident in each item being able to distinguish a lonely from a nonlonely individual. Differential item functioning (DIF) was evident in country differences in the likelihood of endorsing the ""lack companionship"" item at a given level of trait loneliness, and in DIF among marital status, education, and gender subgroups that were comparable across countries. Overall loneliness levels are equivalent in England and the U.S. Risk factor impact did not differ between countries, but differences in risk factor prevalence between countries combined to produce a net result of slightly lower mean levels of loneliness in older adults in England than in the U.S. after risk factor adjustment. The fact that the impact of risk factors were similar across countries suggests that evidence of successful interventions in one country could be leveraged to accelerate development of effective interventions in the other.","Hawkley, Louise C.; Steptoe, Andrew; Schumm, L.

We report the outcome of infected pregnancies from a collaboration formed early during the pandemic between the investigators of two registries, the UK and Global Pregnancy and Neonatal outcomes in COVID‐19 (PAN‐COVID) study and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Section on Neonatal–Perinatal Medicine (SONPM) National Perinatal COVID‐19 Registry. METHODS: This was an analysis of data from the PAN‐COVID registry (1 January to 25 July 2020), which includes pregnancies with suspected or confirmed maternal SARS‐CoV‐2 infection at any stage in pregnancy, and the AAP‐SONPM National Perinatal COVID‐19 registry (4 April to 8 August 2020), which includes pregnancies with positive maternal testing for SARS‐CoV‐2 from 14 days before delivery to 3 days after delivery. The registries collected data on maternal, fetal, perinatal and neonatal outcomes. The PAN‐COVID results are presented overall for pregnancies with suspected or confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and separately in those with confirmed infection. RESULTS: We report on 4005 pregnant women with suspected or confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection (1606 from PAN‐COVID and 2399 from AAP‐SONPM). For obstetric outcomes, in PAN‐COVID overall and in those with confirmed infection in PAN‐COVID and AAP‐SONPM, respectively, maternal death occurred in 0.5%, 0.5% and 0.2% of cases, early neonatal death in 0.2%, 0.3% and 0.3% of cases and stillbirth in 0.5%, 0.6% and 0.4% of cases. Delivery was preterm (< 37 weeks' gestation) in 12.0% of all women in PAN‐COVID, in 16.1% of those women with confirmed infection in PAN‐COVID and in 15.7% of women in AAP‐SONPM. Extreme preterm delivery (< 27 weeks' gestation) occurred in 0.5% of cases in PAN‐COVID and 0.3% in AAP‐SONPM. Neonatal SARS‐CoV‐2 infection was reported in 0.9% of all deliveries in PAN‐COVID overall, in 2.0% in those with confirmed infection in PAN‐COVID and in 1.8% in AAP‐SONPM; the proportions of neonates tested were 9.5%, 20.7% and 87.2%, respectively. The rates of a small‐for‐gestational‐age (SGA) neonate were 8.2% in PAN‐COVID overall, 9.7% in those with confirmed infection and 9.6% in AAP‐SONPM. Mean gestational‐age‐adjusted birth‐weight Z‐scores were −0.03 in PAN‐COVID and −0.18 in AAP‐SONPM. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from the UK and USA registries of pregnancies with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection were remarkably concordant. Preterm delivery affected a higher proportion of women than expected based on historical and contemporaneous national data. The proportions of pregnancies affected by stillbirth, a SGA infant or early neonatal death were comparable to those in historical and contemporaneous UK and USA data. Although maternal death was uncommon, the rate was higher than expected based on UK and USA population data, which is likely explained by underascertainment of women affected by milder or asymptomatic infection in pregnancy in the PAN‐COVID study, although not in the AAP‐SONPM study. The data presented support strong guidance for enhanced precautions to prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in pregnancy, particularly in the context of increased risks of preterm delivery and maternal mortality, and for priority vaccination of pregnant women and women planning pregnancy.

Moreover, we currently lack a thorough understanding of mechanisms of humoral immunity(4). From a larger panel of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the spike (S) glycoprotein(5), we identified several that exhibited potent neutralizing activity and fully blocked the receptor-binding domain of S (S(RBD)) from interacting with human ACE2 (hACE2). Competition-binding, structural, and functional studies allowed clustering of the mAbs into classes recognizing distinct epitopes on the S(RBD) as well as distinct conformational states of the S trimer. Potent neutralizing mAbs recognizing non-overlapping sites, COV2-2196 and COV2-2130, bound simultaneously to S and synergistically neutralized authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus. In two mouse models of SARS-CoV-2 infection, passive transfer of either COV2-2196 or COV2-2130 alone or a combination of both mAbs protected mice from weight loss and reduced viral burden and inflammation in the lung. In addition, passive transfer of each of two of the most potently ACE2 blocking mAbs (COV2-2196 or COV2-2381) as monotherapy protected rhesus macaques from SARS-CoV-2 infection. These results identify protective epitopes on S(RBD) and provide a structure-based framework for rational vaccine design and the selection of robust immunotherapeutics.","Zost, Seth J.; Gilchuk, Pavlo; Case, James Brett; Binshtein, Elad; Chen, Rita E.; Nkolola, Joseph P.; Schäfer, Alexandra; Reidy, Joseph X.; Trivette, Andrew; Nargi, Rachel S.; Sutton, Rachel E.; Suryadevara, Naveenchandra; Martinez, David R.; Williamson, Lauren E.; Chen, Elaine C.; Jones, Taylor; Day, Samuel; Myers, Luke; Hassan, Ahmed O.; Kafai, Natasha M.; Winkler, Emma S.; Fox, Julie M.; Shrihari, Swathi; Mueller, Benjamin K.; Meiler, Jens; Chandrashekar, Abishek; Mercado, Noe B.; Steinhardt, James J.; Ren, Kuishu; Loo, Yueh-Ming; Kallewaard, Nicole L.; McCune, Broc T.; Keeler, Shamus P.; Holtzman, Michael J.; Barouch, Dan H.; Gralinski, Lisa E.; Baric, Ralph S.; Thackray, Larissa B.; Diamond, Michael S.; Carnahan, Robert H.; Crowe, James E.",Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2548-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32668443/,239

As China’s energy sources heavily depend on imports, its economic viability is becoming more and more risky. This study proposes a novel conceptual framework, involving macroeconomic, industrial and geopolitical factors, to evaluate China’s energy security as a major player in the trade dispute. This study also provides a comprehensive strategy for policymakers to make better decisions on reforming renewable energy patterns to guarantee energy security and achieve geopolitical advantages. The PESTEL (political, economic, social, technical, environmental and legislative) and SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) analytical methods are applied to evaluate the factors and attributes of China’s energy development and energy security in the current background. The China-US bipartite game reciprocity model and the QSPM (Quantitative Strategic Planning Matrix) analysis are conducted to assess which energy security strategy and policy are more suitable to deal with China-US trade dispute. To enhance energy security, China should diversify its energy supply chain, develop new sources of energy supply, advance the shale gas technology, popularise cleaner power-generation plants, increase nuclear-energy safety, introduce energy-conservation measures, promote alternative-energy vehicles, engage in international energy diplomacy, and rebuild international energy transaction and settlement systems.","Liu, Shi Qiang; Huang, Xin; Li, Xiangong; Masoud, Mahmoud; Chung, Sai-Ho; Yin, Yong",Discov Energy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s43937-021-00002-6,239

Cardiac involvement is one of the clinical manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and is associated with a worse prognosis; in this setting, few cases of myo-pericarditis with complete imaging documentation have been reported. We discuss a case of a woman admitted to the emergency department with dyspnea. Nasopharyngeal swab showed positive results for SARS-CoV-2. A subsequent 12-lead electrocardiogram showed modifications of T-wave in leads V1 to V6 while blood tests revealed increased levels of troponin I. Coronary computed tomography angiography was performed, excluding hemodynamically significant coronary stenosis. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) was also performed, showing findings fulfilling Lake Louise criteria for the diagnosis of acute myo-pericarditis. To date, myocardial inflammation was recognized as connected with COVID-19 mortality. CMR is an indispensable tool for non-invasive diagnosis of this pathology; however, most clinical studies demonstrated the presence of intramyocardial edema using T1 and T2 mapping sequences.

Although a small number of cases with genomic evidence of second infection have been reported, limited information exists on frequency and determinants of reinfection, time between infections, and duration of immunity after the primary infection. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a reinfection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in a 52-year-old caucasian male whose primary infection was diagnosed in May 2020, during the first wave of the pandemic in Spain, and the second occurred 8 months later, in January 2021. We present a complete dataset including results from real-time polymerase chain reaction, serology, and genome sequencing confirming reinfection with a different clade. Noteworthy was that the patient was immunocompetent but had multiple cardiometabolic comorbidities, including refractory arterial hypertension, that might increase the individual risk in coronavirus disease 2019. CONCLUSIONS: This case of reinfection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 occurring several months after the primary infection reports the longest time interval between reinfection and initial infection described to date. It raises concerns on the duration of protective immunity, suggesting that it may begin to wane in patients who acquired the initial infection during the first wave of the pandemic. The potential contributing role of arterial hypertension and cardiometabolic comorbidities as risk factors for reinfection deserves investigation.","García-Abellán, Javier; Galiana, Antonio; Fernández-González, Marta; Gonzalo-Jiménez, Nieves; Ruiz-García, Montserrat; Botella, Angela; Sanchis, Joan; Mascarell, Paula; Falcón, Selene; Masiá, Mar; Gutiérrez, Félix",J Med Case Rep,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13256-021-03071-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34488872/,239

642481,May 2021: Heterogeneity in reported skin manifestations of COVID-19 and vaccines,2021-03-26,"Background: The accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 through respiratory sampling is critical for the prevention of further transmission and the timely initiation of treatment for COVID-19. There is a diverse range of SARS-CoV-2 detection rates in reported studies, with uncertainty as to the optimal sampling strategy for COVID-19 diagnosis and monitoring. Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing respiratory sampling strategies for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The inclusion criteria were studies that assessed at least two respiratory sampling sites (oropharyngeal swab, nasopharyngeal swab, and sputum) in participants with COVID-19. The percentage positive tests were compared between sampling modalities by constructing a Z-test assuming independence and using the standard errors obtained from the random effects meta-analysis. Findings: From 1039 total studies, we identified 11 studies that met our inclusion criteria, with SARS-CoV-2 testing results from a total of 3442 respiratory tract specimens. Compared to nasopharyngeal swab sampling, sputum testing resulted in significantly higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection while oropharyngeal swab testing had lower rates of viral RNA detection. Earlier sampling after symptom onset was associated with improved detection rates, but the differences in SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection by sampling method was consistent regardless of the duration of symptoms. Interpretation: The results support sputum sampling as a primary method of COVID-19 diagnosis and monitoring, and highlight the importance of early testing after symptom onset to increase the rates of COVID-19 diagnosis.","Mohammadi, A.; Esmaeilzadeh, E.; Li, Y.; Bosch, R.

Objectives: This review aimed to identify which clinical dental procedures do generate droplets and aerosols with subsequent contamination, and for these, characterise their pattern, spread and settle. Materials and Method: Six databases were searched and citation chasing undertaken (to 11/08/20). Screening stages were undertaken in duplicate, independently, by two researchers. Data extraction was performed by one reviewer and verified by another. Results: Eighty-three studies met the inclusion criteria and covered: Ultrasonic scaling (USS, n=44), high speed air-rotor (HSAR, n=31); oral surgery (n=11), slow-speed handpiece (n=4); air-water (triple) syringe (n=4), air-polishing (n=4), prophylaxis (n=2) and hand-scaling (n=2). Although no studies investigated respiratory viruses, those on bacteria, blood splatter and aerosol showed activities using powered devices produced the greatest contamination. Contamination was found for all activities, and at the furthest points studied. The operator torso operator arm, and patient body were especially affected. Heterogeneity precluded significant inter-study comparisons but intra-study comparisons allowed construction of a proposed hierarchy of procedure contamination risk: higher risk (USS, HSAR, air-water syringe [air only or air/water together], air polishing, extractions using motorised hand-pieces); moderate (slow-speed handpieces, prophylaxis with pumice, extractions) and lower (air-water syringe [water only] and hand scaling. Conclusion: Significant gaps in the evidence, low sensitivity of measures and variable quality limit firm conclusions around contamination for different procedures. However, a hierarchy of contamination from procedures can be proposed for challenge/verification by future research which should consider standardised methodologies to facilitate research synthesis. Clinical significance (49 words): This manuscript addresses uncertainty around aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) in dentistry. Findings indicate a continuum of procedure-related aerosol generation rather than the current binary AGP or non-AGP perspective. This informs discussion around AGPs and direct future research to help support knowledge and decision making around COVID-19 and dental procedures.","Innes, Nicola; Johnson, Ilona; Al-Yaseen, Waraf; Harris, Rebecca; Jones, Rhiannon; Sukriti, KC; McGregor, Scott; Robertson, Mark; Wade, William; Gallagher, Jennifer",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.28.20183475; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.28.20183475v1?rss=1,239
642801,Repurposed prophylaxis strategies for COVID-19: a systematic review,2020-06-03,"The outbreak of the novel and highly infectious severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in hundreds of millions of infections and millions of deaths globally. Infected individuals that progress to coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) experience upper and lower respiratory complications that range in severity and may lead to wide-spread inflammation and generalized hypoxia or hypoxemia that impacts multiple organ systems, including the central and peripheral nervous systems. Since the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, multiple reports continue to emerge that detail neurological symptoms, ranging from relatively mild (e.g., impaired taste and/or smell) to severe (e.g., stroke), suggesting SARS-CoV-2 may be neurotropic and/or contribute to nervous system injury through direct and/or indirect mechanisms. To gain insight into the types of neurological complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and their possible relationship with age, sex, COVID-19 severity, and comorbidities, we performed a systematic review of case reports and series published in 2020 – April 4, 2021 of infected patients with neurological manifestations. Meta-analyses were conducted using individual patient data from reports where these data could be extracted. Here, we report neurological injury occurs across the lifespan in the context of infection, with and without known comorbidities, and with all disease severities, including asymptomatic patients. Older individuals, however, are more susceptible to developing life-threatening COVID-19 and cerebrovascular disease (CVD), such as stroke. A mild but inverse correlation with age was seen with CNS inflammatory diseases, such as encephalitis, as well as taste and/or smell disorders. When reported, increased age was also associated with comorbid cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and lipid disorders, but not with obesity. Obesity did correlate with development of critical COVID-19. Discussion into potential pathophysiological mechanisms by which neurological symptoms arise and long-term consequences of infection to the nervous system is also provided.","Sullivan, Brianne N.; Fischer, Tracy",Front Aging Neurosci,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnagi.2021.653694; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34408638/,239

Containment strategies and local cognition regarding pandemic might be helpful to control vehicular movement. This study aimed to ascertain the effectiveness of containment strategies and local cognition for controlling traffic volume during COVID-19 pandemic in Dhaka, Bangladesh. METHOD: Six containment strategies were considered to explore their influence on traffic condition, including declaration of general holiday, closure of educational institution, deployment of force, restriction on religious gathering, closure of commercial activities, and closure of garments factories. Newspaper coverage and public concern about COVID-19 were considered as local cognition in this research. The month of Ramadan as a potential event was also taken into account considering it might have an impact on the overall situation. Average daily journey speed (ADJS) was calculated from real-time traffic data of Google Map to understand the vehicular traffic scenario of Dhaka. A multiple linear regression method was developed to comprehend the findings. RESULTS: The results showed that among the containment strategies, declaration of general holiday and closure of educational institutions could increase the ADJS significantly, thereby referring to less traffic movement. Besides, local cognition could not significantly affect the traffic condition, although the month of Ramadan could increase the ADJS significantly.

648025,Extrapulmonary onset manifestations of COVID-19,2021-06-29,"BACKGROUND: There is evidence suggesting that quarantine might have undesirable psychological impacts on the patients. Therefore, it is important to seek for ways to increase the resilience and alleviate the psychological pressure of the patients who are quarantined due to infection with COVID-19. The present study was conducted to assess an online multimedia psychoeducational intervention regarding the feasibility, adherence, patient satisfaction and effectiveness on resilience and perceived stress of patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19. METHOD: This was a pilot cluster randomized parallel-controlled trial with hospital wards as the units of randomization. Participants in this fully online trial were 50 consecutive patients who were hospitalized in 2 hospitals in Shiraz, after being diagnosed with COVID-19. Before the beginning of the intervention, four inpatient wards inside two of the hospitals were randomly assigned to either intervention or control conditions. All eligible participants in the wards allocated to the intervention condition received online multimedia psychoeducational interventions during the 2 weeks, whilst the patients in the wards allocated to the control condition were offered the opportunity to receive telephone-based psychological counseling if needed. Psychoeducational interventions mainly included cognitive–behavioural techniques, stress management techniques, mindfulness-based stress reduction and positive psychotherapy. The patients were assessed regarding resilience and perceived stress at baseline and after two weeks. RESULTS: Of 27 patients starting multimedia psychoeducational interventions, 26 (96.29%) completed post-assessments. A high level of adherence (80.76%) and satisfaction (Mean = 29.42; SD = 4.18) with the online multimedia psychoeducational interventions was found. Compared with the control group, the patients who used online multimedia psychoeducational interventions reported greater resilience (Mean(intervention) = 81.74; Mean(control) = 72.86; adjusted t (46) = 2.10; p = 0.04; CI: 0.39 to 17.38; dppc2 = 0.83) and fewer perceived stress (Mean(intervention) = 22.15; Mean(control) = 29.45; adjusted t (46) = 2.66; p = 0.01; CI: − 12.81 to − 1.78; dppc2 = − 0.77) after 2 weeks. DISCUSSION: The findings of the present study provided a successful first attempt at implementing feasible online multimedia psychoeducational interventions to promote resilience and mitigate stress among the patients who were hospitalized due to infection with COVID-19. The present results could help mental health professionals to determine which psychological techniques should be emphasized to promote patients’ resilience in the context of COVID-19 disease.

648052,Impact of infection preventionists on Centers for Medicare and Medicaid quality measures in Maryland nursing homes,2013-12-31,"OBJECTIVES: Demand for hand sanitizers has surged since the coronavirus broke out and spread around the world. Hand sanitizers are usually applied by squirting the sanitizer liquid when one presses a pump with one’s hand. This causes many people to come into contact with the pump handle, which increases the risk of viral transmission. Some hand sanitizers on the market are automatically pumped. However, because sanitizer containers and pump devices are designed to be compatible only between products produced by the same manufacturer, consumers must also repurchase the container for the liquid if they replace the hand sanitizer. Therefore, this paper suggests the design of an automatic hand sanitizer system compatible with various sanitizer containers. METHODS: An automatic hand sanitizer system was designed, which will be presented in two stages describing the instrument structure and control parts. This work focused on using the elasticity of pumps and improving people’s access to devices. RESULTS: We have designed an automatic hand sanitizer system that is compatible with various containers. When one moves one’s hand close to the device sensor, the hand sanitizer container is pumped once. CONCLUSIONS: The automatic hand sanitizer device proposed in this paper is ultimately expected to contribute to contactless hand disinfection in public places and virus infection prevention. Additionally, it is economical and eco-friendly by decreasing waste emissions.","Lee, Juhui; Lee, Jin-Young; Cho, Sung-Min; Yoon, Ki-Cheol; Kim, Young Jae; Kim, Kwang Gi",Healthc Inform Res,https://doi.org/10.4258/hir.2020.26.3.243; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32819043/,239
648192,Mavrilimumab for severe COVID-19 – Authors' reply,2020-09-05,"BACKGROUND: Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a public health crisis with more than 2 million people living with OUD in the United States. Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) is an evidence-based approach for the treatment of OUD that relies on a combination of behavioral therapy and medication. Less than half of those living with OUD are accessing this treatment. Mobile technology can enhance the treatment of chronic diseases in readily accessible and cost-effective ways through self-monitoring and support. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to describe the adaptation of a mobile platform for patients undergoing treatment for OUD and preliminary pilot testing results. METHODS: Our study was conducted with patient and provider participants at the University of Virginia MAT clinic and was approved by the institutional review board. The formative phase included semistructured interviews to understand the needs of patients with OUD, providers’ perspectives, and opportunities for MAT support via a mobile app. A second round of formative interviews used mock-ups of app features to collect feedback on feature function and desirability. Formative participants’ input from 16 interviews then informed the development of a functional smartphone app. Patient participants (n=25) and provider participants (n=3) were enrolled in a 6-month pilot study of the completed platform. Patient app use and usability interviews, including a system usability score and open-ended questions, were completed 1 month into the pilot study. Open-ended responses were analyzed for prevalent themes. RESULTS: Formative interviews resulted in the development of a mobile app, named HOPE, which includes both evidence-based and participant-suggested features. The features included daily prompts for monitoring mood, stress, treatment adherence, and substance use; patient tracking of goals, reminders, and triggering or encouraging experiences; informational resources; an anonymous community board to share support with other patients; and secure messaging for communication between patients and providers. All patient participants engaged with at least one app feature during their first month of pilot study participation, and the daily self-monitoring prompts were the most used. Patients and providers reported high levels of system usability (mean 86.9, SD 10.2 and mean 83.3, SD 12.8, respectively). Qualitative analysis of open-ended usability questions highlighted the value of self-monitoring, access to support through the app, and perceived improvement in connection to care and communication for both patient and provider participants. CONCLUSIONS: The use of the HOPE program by pilot participants, high usability scoring, and positive perceptions from 1-month interviews indicate successful program development. By engaging with end users and eliciting feedback throughout the development process, we were able to create an app and a web portal that was highly usable and acceptable to study participants. Further work is needed to understand the program’s effect on clinical outcomes, patient linkage, and engagement in care.","Waselewski, Marika Elise; Flickinger, Tabor Elisabeth; Canan, Chelsea; Harrington, William; Franklin, Taylor; Otero, Kori Nicole; Huynh, Jacqueline; Waldman, Ava Lena Davila; Hilgart, Michelle; Ingersoll, Karen; Ait-Daoud Tiouririne, Nassima; Dillingham, Rebecca Anne",JMIR Form Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33620324/; https://doi.org/10.2196/24561,239
648255,COVID-19 pandemic and Vascular Surgery Unit,2020-05-23,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has affected millions of people worldwide. This pandemic requires newer medical management strategies to control the morbidity and mortality associated with the disease. Several approaches, including global targeting of inflammation or neutralizing a single key inflammatory mediator, are being employed to cope with cytokine storms in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). The role of anti-inflammatory biologics, such as acalabrutinib, tocilizumab, anakinra, and itolizumab can become relevant. Itolizumab is a humanized recombinant immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody. It targets the extracellular, scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) distal domain 1 of CD6 and is responsible for priming, activation, and differentiation of T-cells. Itolizumab has been approved by the Drug Controller General of India for the treatment of COVID-19 in India. Here, we shared our clinical experience of 20 patients having moderate acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19 on treatment with itolizumab.

Cocoa flavanols are promising nutraceuticals with possible beneficial vascular effects in humans. However, limited research is currently available on the vascular effects in a diabetic population with inconsistent results. Possible reasons for this inconsistency might be heterogeneity in the given intervention (dose per time and day, single dose vs. split-dose, placebo formula) and the studied population (blood pressure at baseline, duration of diabetes, use of vasoactive antihypertensive and antidiabetic drugs, sex). Therefore, we aimed to develop a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled cross-over trial to investigate whether cocoa flavanols have an acute impact on blood pressure and vascular reactivity in patients with type 2 diabetes with and without arterial hypertension. Methods and Analysis: We will include participants in four groups: (i) patients with type 2 diabetes without arterial hypertension, (ii) patients with type 2 diabetes with arterial hypertension and 1 antihypertensive drug, (iii) non-diabetic participants with essential hypertension and 1 antihypertensive drug, and (iv) healthy controls. All participants will complete the same protocol on both testing days, consuming high-flavanol cocoa extract (790 mg flavanols) or placebo. Macrovascular endothelial function (flow-mediated dilation) and blood pressure will be measured before and after capsule ingestion. Forearm muscle vasoreactivity (near-infrared spectroscopy) and brachial artery blood flow (echo-doppler) will be assessed in response to a dynamic handgrip exercise test after capsule ingestion.

Due to the lack of information about the pathogenesis-specific treatment of Covid-19, early diagnosis and timely treatment are important. However, there is still a lack of information about routine-blood-parameteres (RBP) findings and effects in the disease process. Although the literature includes various interventions, existing studies need to be generalized and their reliability improved. In this study, the efficacy of routine blood values used in the diagnosis and prognosis of Covid-19 and independent biomarkers obtained from them were evaluated retrospectively in a large patient group. Low lymphocyte (LYM) and white-blood-cell (WBC), high CRP and Ferritin were effective in the diagnosis of the disease. The d-CWL= CRP WBC ∗ L Y M and d-CFL= CRP ∗ F e r r i t i n LYM biomarkers derived from them were the most important risk factors in diagnosing the disease and were more successful than direct RBP values. High d-CWL and d-CFL values ​​largely confirmed the Covid-19 diagnosis. The most effective RBP in the prognosis of the disease was CRP. (d-CIT) = CRP*INR*Troponin; (d-CT) = CRP*Troponin; (d-PPT) = PT*Troponin*Procalcitonin biomarkers were found to be more successful than direct RBP values and biomarkers used in previous studies in the prognosis of the disease. Finally, an open-access data source consisting of RBC was created for studies to be carried out in the fight against COVİD-19.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of remote communication on families’ evaluation of end-of-life care during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Retrospective, cross-sectional, mixed methods study using data from an after-death survey administered from March 17–June 30, 2020. The primary outcome was the next of kin’s global assessment of care during the Veteran’s last month of life. RESULTS: Data were obtained from the next-of-kin of 328 Veterans who died in an inpatient unit (i.e., acute care, intensive care, nursing home, hospice units) in one of 37 VA medical centers with the highest numbers of COVID-19 cases. The adjusted percentage of bereaved families reporting excellent overall end-of-life care was statistically significantly higher among those reporting Very Effective remote communication compared to those reporting that remote communication was Mostly, Somewhat, or Not at All Effective (69.5% vs. 35.7%). Similar differences were observed in evaluations of remote communication effectiveness with the healthcare team. Overall, 81.3% of family members who offered positive comments about communication with either the Veteran or the healthcare team reported excellent overall end-of-life care vs. 28.4% who made negative comments CONCLUSIONS: Effective remote communication with the patient and the healthcare team was associated with significantly better ratings of the overall experience of end-of-life care by bereaved family members.

649681,COVID-19 infection in type 1 diabetes: emerging data,2021-04-06,"Background COVID-19 patients shed SARS-CoV-2 RNA in their faeces. We hypothesised that detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) influent could be a valuable tool to assist in public health decision making. We aimed to rapidly develop and validate a scalable methodology for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater that could be implemented at a national level and to determine the relationship between the wastewater signal and COVID-19 cases in the community. Methods We developed a filtration-based methodology for the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 from WWTP influent and subsequent detection and quantification by RT-qPCR. This methodology was used to monitor 28 WWTPs across Scotland, serving 50% of the population. For each WWTP catchment area, we collected data describing COVID-19 cases and deaths. We quantified spatial and temporal relationships between SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater and COVID-19 cases. Findings Daily WWTP SARS-CoV-2 influent viral RNA load, calculated using daily influent flow rates, had the strongest correlation ({rho}>0.9) with COVID-19 cases within a catchment. As the incidence of COVID-19 cases within a community increased, a linear relationship emerged between cases and influent viral RNA load. There were significant differences between WWTPs in their capacity to predict case numbers based on influent viral RNA load, with the limit of detection ranging from twenty-five cases for larger plants to a single case in smaller plants. Interpretation The levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in WWTP influent provide a cost-effective and unbiased measure of COVID-19 incidence within a community, indicating that national scale wastewater-based epidemiology can play a role in COVID-19 surveillance. In Scotland, wastewater testing has been expanded to cover 75% of the population, with sub-catchment sampling being used to focus surge testing. SARS-CoV-2 variant detection, assessment of vaccination on community transmission and surveillance for other infectious diseases represent promising future applications.","Fitzgerald, S.

649815,The Clinical Frailty Scale: Estimating the Prevalence of Frailty in Older Patients Hospitalised with COVID-19. The COPE Study,2020-09-21,"The salivary gland is an important tissue for persistence and transmission of multiple viruses. Previous work showed that salivary gland tissue-resident CD8(+) T cells elicited by viruses were poorly functional ex vivo. Using a model of persistent murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection, we now show that CD8(+) T cells in the salivary gland and other non-lymphoid tissues of mice express multiple molecules associated with T cell exhaustion including PD-1, CD73 and CD39. Strikingly however, these molecules were expressed independently of virus or antigen. Rather, PD-1-expressing T cells remained PD-1(+) after migration into tissues regardless of infection, while CD73 was activated on CD8(+) T cells by TGF-β signaling. Blockade of PD-L1, but not CD73, improved cytokine production by salivary gland T cells ex vivo and increased the expression of granzyme B after stimulation within the salivary gland. Nevertheless, salivary-gland localized CD8(+) T cells could kill PD-L1-expressing targets in vivo, albeit with modest efficiency, and this was not improved by PD-L1 blockade. Moreover, the impact of PD-L1 blockade on granzyme B expression waned with time. In contrast, the function of kidney-localized T cells was improved by CD73 blockade, but was unaffected by PD-L1 blockade. These data show that tissue localization per se is associated with expression of inhibitory molecules that can impact T cell function, but that the functional impact of this expression is context- and tissue-dependent.","Smith, Corinne J.; Snyder, Christopher M.",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.704862; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34335618/,239

Despite a limited antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, several drugs serve as candidates for application, not only in infected individuals but also as prophylaxis to prevent infection establishment. Here we use a stochastic model to describe the early phase of a viral infection. We find that the critical efficacy needed to block viral establishment is typically above 80%. This value can be improved by combination therapy. Below the critical efficacy, establishment can still sometimes be prevented; for that purpose, drugs blocking viral entry into target cells (or equivalently enhancing viral clearance) are more effective than drugs reducing viral production or enhancing infected cell death. When a viral infection cannot be prevented because of high exposure or low drug efficacy, antivirals can still delay the time to reach detectable viral loads from 4 days when untreated to up to 30 days. This delay flattens the within-host epidemic curve, and possibly reduces transmission and symptom severity. These results suggest that antiviral prophylaxis, even with reduced efficacy, could be efficiently used to prevent or alleviate infection in people at high risk. It could thus be an important component of the strategy to combat the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the months or years to come.","Czuppon, P.; Debarre, F.; Goncalves, A.; Tenaillon, O.; Perelson, A.

Clearly, these are extremely ambitious aims, but recent developments in different life science disciplines slowly allow us to set them as realistic, although very distant, goals. Besides classical approaches to obtain high‐resolution information of the molecules, particles and machines involved, we require approaches that can monitor collective behaviour of many molecules, particles and machines simultaneously, in order to reveal design principles of the systems as a whole. Here we will discuss approaches that fall in the latter category, namely time‐lapse imaging and single‐particle tracking (SPT) combined with computational analysis and modelling, and genome‐wide RNA interference approaches to reveal the host components required for virus entry. These techniques should in the future allow us to assign host genes to the systems’ functions and characteristics, and allow emergence‐driven, in silico assembly of networks that include interactions with increasing hierarchy (molecules–multiprotein complexes–vesicles and organelles), and kinetics and subcellular spatiality, in order to allow realistic simulations of virus entry in real time.","Damm, Eva‐Maria; Pelkmans, Lucas",Cell Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16803584/,239
651792,Experience in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa and COVID-19 symptoms,2020-06-27,"BACKGROUND: Evidence on the spectrum of risk factors for infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among front-line healthcare workers (HCWs) has not been well-described. While several studies evaluating the risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection among patient-facing and non-patient-facing front-line HCWs have been reported since the outbreak of the coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19), and several more are still underway. There is, therefore, an immediate need for an ongoing, rigorous systematic review that continuously assesses the risk factors of SARS-CoV-2 infection among front-line HCWs. OBJECTIVE: Here, we outline a protocol to serve as a guideline for conducting a living systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the burden of COVID-19 on front-line HCWs and identify risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection in patient-facing and non-patient-facing front-line HCWs. METHODS: The protocol was developed and reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P). The conduct of the proposed living systematic review and meta-analysis will primarily follow the principles recommended in the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) guidance for undertaking systematic reviews in healthcare, and the Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines. The systematic literature searches will be performed using the EBSCOhost platform by searching the following databases within the platform: Academic search complete, health source: nursing/academic edition, CINAHL with full text, Embase, PubMed, MEDLINE, Science Direct databases, Google Scholar, and; also a search in the China National Knowledge Infrastructure and the World Health Organization library databases for relevant studies will be performed. The searches will include peer-reviewed articles, published in English and Mandarin language irrespective of publication year, evaluating the risk for testing positive for C0VID-19, the risk of developing symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, or both, among front-line HCWs. The initial review period will consider articles published since the onset of COVID-19 disease to the present and then updated monthly. Review Manager (RevMan 5.3) will be used to pool the odds ratios or mean differences for individual risk factors where possible. Results will be presented as relative risks and 95% confidence intervals for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences, or standardised mean differences along with 95% confidence intervals, for continuous outcomes. The Newcastle–Ottawa Scale will be used to rate study quality, and the certainty of the evidence will be assessed by using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE). The results of the living systematic review and meta-analysis will be reported per the PRISMA guidelines. DISCUSSION: Though addressing the needs of front-line HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic is a high priority, data to inform such initiatives are inadequate, particularly data on the risk factor disparities between patient-facing and non-patient-facing front-line HCWs. The proposed living systematic review and meta-analysis anticipate finding relevant studies reporting risk factors driving the SARS-CoV-2 infection rates among patient-facing and non-patient-facing front-line HCWs, thus providing subsidies for public health interventions and occupational health policies. The study results will be disseminated electronically, in print and through conference presentation, and key stakeholder meetings in the form of policy briefs.

The aim was to examine knowledge on warfarin, medication belief, depression, and self-efficacy as factors influencing medication adherence for anticoagulation control. This was a cross-sectional study. The participants in this study were patients who visited an outpatient clinic of cardiovascular surgery to administer anticoagulants after mechanical valve replacement surgery at a tertiary hospital in Seoul. Responses of 154 participants on questionnaires were analyzed from 10 September to 26 December 2020. Multiple regression analyses were performed to assess the factors influencing medication adherence among the patients with anticoagulation control. Factors influencing medication adherence were consuming warfarin for 3 to 5 years, awareness of target prothrombin time international normalized ratio, knowledge of warfarin, and depression. Medication beliefs and self-efficacy had no significant influence on medication adherence. The most important factors associated with medication adherence in patients with mechanical heart valves were knowledge about warfarin and depression. In the control of oral anticoagulants that require continuous management, education and providing accurate guidance is more important than personal preferences. Clinical nurses should facilitate educational programs tailored to the characteristics of the patient, including their purpose and method of taking warfarin, specific diets, their knowledge on warfarin’s interaction with other drugs, symptoms of adverse events, and self-management. In addition, healthcare providers should check whether warfarin therapy is being controlled by evaluating medication adherence and depression levels among patients.","Park, Soohyun; Jang, Insil",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18105214; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34068932/,239
653307,ENDOCRINOLOGY IN THE TIME OF COVID-19: Diagnosis and management of gestational diabetes mellitus,2020-05-26,"BACKGROUND: Environmental cadmium exposure is widespread. In humans, cadmium is poorly excreted, triggers pulmonary inflammation, reduces pulmonary function, and enhances lung injury by respiratory syncytial virus. OBJECTIVES: We examined the association of cadmium burden with mortality related to influenza or pneumonia. METHODS: This prospective analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) included 7,173 and 8,678 participants [Formula: see text] years of age enrolled in NHANES-III and NHANES 1999–2006, respectively. Associations were evaluated between cadmium and mortality from influenza or pneumonia during a median follow-up of 17.3 y (NHANES-III, based on creatinine-corrected urine cadmium) and 11.4 y (NHANES 1999–2006, based on blood cadmium). Survey-weighted Cox proportional hazard models were used to compute hazard ratios (HRs) comparing the mortality of individuals at the 80th vs. the 20th percentile of cadmium concentrations. RESULTS: In NHANES-III, after adjustment for sex, race/ethnicity, education, body mass index, serum cholesterol, hypertension, and NHANES phase (or cycle), the HR comparing influenza or pneumonia mortality among participants with creatinine-corrected urinary cadmium in the 80th vs. 20th percentile was 1.15 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.26; [Formula: see text]) in the population as a whole and 1.27 (95% CI: 1.12, 1.43; [Formula: see text]) among never smokers. In NHANES 1999–2006, adjusted HRs for the 80th vs. 20th percentile of blood cadmium were 1.14 (95% CI: 0.96, 1.36; [Formula: see text]) for the overall population and 1.71 (95% CI: 0.95, 3.09; [Formula: see text]) in never smokers. DISCUSSION: Among middle-aged and older adults in the United States, higher cadmium burdens are associated with higher mortality from influenza or pneumonia. This raises the possibility that cadmium may worsen outcomes from COVID-19 infections. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP7598","Park, Sung Kyun; Sack, Coralynn; Sirén, Matti J.; Hu, Howard",Environ Health Perspect,https://doi.org/10.1289/ehp7598; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33325772/,239

Our aim is to develop an accurate indicator of adverse outcomes based on a retrospective analysis of a COVID-19 database established at the Emergency Department (ED) of a North-Italian hospital during the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Laboratory, clinical, psychosocial and functional characteristics including those obtained from the Braden Scale—a standardized scale to quantify the risk of pressure sores which takes into account aspects of sensory perception, activity, mobility and nutrition—from the records of 117 consecutive patients with swab-positive COVID-19 disease admitted to the Emergency Medicine ward between March 1, 2020 and April 15, 2020 were included in the analysis. Adverse outcomes included admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and in-hospital death. Among the parameters collected, the highest cutoff sensitivity and specificity scores to best predict adverse outcomes were displayed by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) blood value at admission > 439 U/L, Horowitz Index (P/F Ratio) < 257 and Braden score < 18. The estimation power reached 93.6%. We named the assessment BLITZ (Braden-LDH-HorowITZ). Despite the retrospective and preliminary nature of the data, a multidimensional tool to assess overall functions, not chronological age, produced the highest prediction power for poor outcomes in relation to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further analyses are now needed to establish meaningful correlations between ventilation therapies and multidimensional frailty as assessed by ad-hoc validated and standardized tools.","Lagolio, Erik; Demurtas, Jacopo; Buzzetti, Roberto; Cortassa, Giorgio; Bottone, Stefania; Spadafora, Laura; Cocino, Cristina; Smith, Lee; Benzing, Thomas; Polidori, Maria Cristina",Intern Emerg Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34322832/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11739-021-02805-w,239

Methods She had been taking lisinopril for the last 18 months. She was diagnosed with COVID-19 in March 2020 presenting with fever, cough, shortness of breath and anosmia. She did not require hospital admission initially however has been readmitted twice with profound breathlessness and fever. She has subsequently developed a long COVID-19 syndrome with a daily, fluctuating fever of up to 39 °C for the last six months, profound fatigue, persistent shortness of breath with bilateral ground glass changes seen on high resolution CT chest imaging and mild anaemia. During this time, she subsequently reported four episodes of acute onset of severe angioedema affecting the lips and tongue for which she self-medicated with anti-histamines. Results Following disclosure of these episodes her lisinopril was ceased and there have been no further episodes to date. There are two other case reports in the literature that propose a potential relationship between angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor induced angioedema and COVID-19. It is known that SAR-CoV-2 binds with high affinity to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptors which are found in oral tissues, heart, kidneys and the lung. ACE inhibitors can be associated with angioedema in approximately 0.5% of patients prescribed an ACE inhibitor. It occurs most commonly in the first year following instigation of treatment but can occur years later. The proposed mechanism of action is via the degradation of bradykinin. Bradykinin is converted from Kallikrenin by C1 esterase, and ACE in turn metabolises bradykinin. Conclusion Bradykinin affects vascular permeability and results in vasodilatation, when patients take an ACE inhibitor there is a slower rate of bradykinin degradation and therefore this accumulation results in ACE inhibitor induced angioedema. SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE2 receptors. ACE2 is thought to counterbalance ACE in the renin-angiotensin system, it is theorised that the potential downregulation of ACE2 by the presence of bound SARS-CoV-2 may therefore potentiate angioedema in susceptible individuals. At present we cannot confirm this proposed relationship and global current consensus supports the ongoing use of ACE inhibitors during the pandemic but clinicians should continue to be aware of emergent pathologies related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

654604,Dermatological findings in patients admitting to dermatology clinic after using face masks during Covid‐19 pandemia: A new health problem,2021-03-23,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) allow cell-to-cell communication and can induce a strong immune response, by presenting antigens. EVs can be engineered to display viral antigens and so induce high and specific CD8(+) T cell and B cell reactions, highlighting these antigen-presenting EVs as a novel vaccine strategy. EVs present a low basal immunogenic profile and engineered EVs represent a safe, flexible, and efficient strategy for a virus-free vaccine design. Some biotech companies are developing EV-based vaccines against COVID-19, by displaying the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein on the exosome surface or by delivering mRNAs of viral proteins through EVs. ABSTRACT: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are secreted from almost all human cells and mediate intercellular communication by transferring heterogeneous molecules (i.e., DNA, RNAs, proteins, and lipids). In this way, EVs participate in various biological processes, including immune responses. Viruses can hijack EV biogenesis systems for their dissemination, while EVs from infected cells can transfer viral proteins to uninfected cells and to immune cells in order to mask the infection or to trigger a response. Several studies have highlighted the role of native or engineered EVs in the induction of B cell and CD8(+) T cell reactions against viral proteins, strongly suggesting these antigen-presenting EVs as a novel strategy for vaccine design, including the emerging COVID-19. EV-based vaccines overcome some limitations of conventional vaccines and introduce novel unique characteristics useful in vaccine design, including higher bio-safety and efficiency as antigen-presenting systems and as adjuvants. Here, we review the state-of-the-art for antiviral EV-based vaccines, including the ongoing projects of some biotech companies in the development of EV-based vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we discuss the limits for further development of this promising class of therapeutic agents.","Sabanovic, Berina; Piva, Francesco; Cecati, Monia; Giulietti, Matteo",Biology (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/biology10020094; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33513850/,239

Most postmortem studies to date reveal diffuse alveolar damage as the most relevant histologic pattern. Antemortem lung biopsy may however provide more precise data regarding the earlier stages of the disease, providing a basis for novel treatment approaches. OBJECTIVES: To ascertain the morphological and immunohistochemical features of lung samples obtained in patients with moderate Covid-19 pneumonia. METHODS: Transbronchial lung cryobiopsy was carried out in 12 Covid-19 patients within 20 days of symptom onset. RESULTS: Histopathologic changes included spots of patchy acute lung injury with alveolar type II cell hyperplasia, with no evidence of hyaline membranes. Strong nuclear expression of phosphorylated STAT3 was observed in >50% of AECII. Interalveolar capillaries showed enlarged lumen and were in part arranged in superposed rows. Pulmonary venules were characterized by luminal enlargement, thickened walls, and perivascular CD4(+) T-cell infiltration. A strong nuclear expression of phosphorylated STAT3, associated with PD-L1 and IDO expression, was observed in endothelial cells of venules and interstitial capillaries. Alveolar spaces macrophages exhibited a peculiar phenotype (CD68, CD11c, CD14, CD205, CD206, CD123/IL3AR, and PD-L1). CONCLUSIONS: Morphologically distinct features were identified in early stages of Covid-19 pneumonia, with epithelial and endothelial cell abnormalities different from either classical interstitial lung diseases or diffuse alveolar damage. Alveolar type II cell hyperplasia was a prominent event in the majority of cases. Inflammatory cells expressed peculiar phenotypes. No evidence of hyaline membranes and endothelial changes characterized by IDO expression might in part explain the compliance and the characteristic pulmonary vasoplegia observed in less-advanced Covid-19 pneumonia.","Doglioni, Claudio; Ravaglia, Claudia; Chilosi, Marco; Rossi, Giulio; Dubini, Alessandra; Pedica, Federica; Piciucchi, Sara; Vizzuso, Antonio; Stella, Franco; Maitan, Stefano; Agnoletti, Vanni; Puglisi, Silvia; Poletti, Giovanni; Sambri, Vittorio; Pizzolo, Giovanni; Bronte, Vincenzo; Wells, Athol U.; Poletti, Venerino",Respiration,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33725700/; https://doi.org/10.1159/000514822,239

With hopes for release of a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine underway, understanding parental perception of vaccines is important to design successful vaccination interventions. METHODS: A web-based, cross-sectional survey was administered to approximately 900 parents in Johnson County, Kansas during the summer of 2020. Pearson chi square and Mann-Whitney U tests were utilized to assess the attitudes of Kansas parents towards a potential addition of the influenza vaccine to the required list for K-12 students and furthermore, their general perception of vaccinations, and the impact of COVID-19 on those beliefs. RESULTS: A total of 179 parents responded. Fifty-one percent (n = 92) were in favor of adding the influenza vaccine to the mandatory list (Pro-Addition). Anti-Addition parents had significantly higher levels of distrust (2.1, p < 0.001) and were significantly more concerned about vaccine adverse effects. When presented with a hypothetical situation in which a “safe and effective” COVID-19 vaccine was available, 24% of Anti-Addition parents indicated they would receive the vaccine or obtain it for their children (21 people, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Kansas suburban parents were split on their attitudes towards the addition of the influenza vaccine to the required list for children and the effects of the pandemic.

Similar to sepsis, monocyte/macrophage subsets are considered key mediators of the life-threatening hyper-inflammatory disorder characterizing severe COVID-19. In this study, we longitudinally analyzed MDW values in a cohort of 87 COVID-19 patients consecutively admitted to our hospital, showing significant correlations between MDW and common inflammatory markers, namely CRP (p < 0.001), fibrinogen (p < 0.001) and ferritin (p < 0.01). Moreover, high MDW values resulted to be prognostically associated with fatal outcome in COVID-19 patients (AUC = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.66–0.87, sensitivity 0.75, specificity 0.70, MDW threshold 26.4; RR = 4.91, 95% CI: 1.73–13.96; OR = 7.14, 95% CI: 2.06–24.71).

In some places, due to low vaccination rates and new variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerging, psychosocial strategies for remaining resilient during an ongoing multi-faceted stressor are still needed. Elsewhere, thanks to successful vaccination campaigns, some countries have begun reopening but questions remain regarding how to best recover, adjust, and grow following the collective stress and loss caused by the pandemic. METHOD Here, we briefly describe three evidence-based strategies that can help foster individual and collective recovery, growth, and resilience: cultivating social belonging, practicing compassion, and engaging in kindness. RESULTS Social belonging involves a sense of interpersonal connectedness. Practicing compassion involves perceiving suffering as part of a larger shared human experience and directing kindness toward it. Finally, engaging in kindness involves prosocial acts toward others. CONCLUSIONS Together, these strategies can promote social connectedness and help reduce anxiety, stress, and depression, which may help psychologists, policymakers, and the global community remain resilience in places where cases are still high while promoting adjustment and growth in communities that are now recovering and looking to the future.","Slavich, George M; Roos, Lydia G; Zaki, Jamil","Anxiety, stress, and coping",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34369221/; https://doi.org/10.1080/10615806.2021.1950695,239

Therefore, Spike-ACE2 interaction is a crucial determining factor for viral infectivity. A new phylogenetic group of SARS-CoV-2 (lineage B.1.1.7) has been recently identified in the COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium dataset, which features an amino acid substitution in the Spike RBD (N501Y mutation). Infections with the SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 have been overgrowing in recent weeks in the United Kingdom, indicating an even greater spread capacity than that seen with previous strains of the novel coronavirus. We hypothesized that this rapid spreading/infectivity of the B.1.1.7 lineage might be due to changes in the interaction force between the mutant Spike RBD and ACE2. This study employed in silico methods involving mutagenesis (N501Y mutation) and interface analysis focusing on the Spike RDB-ACE2 interaction. The results showed that the SARS-CoV-2 N501Y mutant (lineage B.1.1.7) establishes a more significant number of interactions relating to the mutant residue Y501 (Spike RDB) with residues Y41 and K353 (ACE2). This finding shows that the increased infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 is associated with the interaction force between the Spike RBD Y501 mutant residue with the ACE2 receptor, which in this strain is increased.","Santos, Jadson C.; Passos, Geraldo A.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.29.424708,239

657549,[Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on admissions for acute coronary syndrome: review of the literature and single-center experience],2020,"INTRODUCTION: The distal transradial approach (dTRA) is progressively gaining more clinical use in the fields of cardiology and other vascular interventions, as it offers a number of advantages compared to conventional radial approach (TRA). These include lower rates of vascular occlusion which permits preservation of the proximal radial artery for future procedures in the event of a distal occlusion. AIM: To share the experience in the use of dTRA for neurointerventions, showing its advantages, pitfalls as well as sharing our optimized puncture and hemostatic ultrarapid compression protocols to improve the use of this vascular access. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of our experience of diagnostic and interventional procedures performed via dTRA using an optimized protocol for puncture and postpuncture compression of the dTRA was performed. The rate of complications (hematoma and arterial dissection at puncture site) femoral crossover, and assessment of postprocedural stenosis/occlusion with the ultrarapid compression protocol were also assessed. RESULTS: From March 2019 to July 2020 a total of 100 distal radial procedures were carried out and 53 diagnostic angiograms (53%) and 47 interventional procedures (47%) were included in the analysis. We achieved a 96% technical success, with a femoral crossover requirement in 3 cases (3%), and one conventional TRA crossover due to puncture failure. Of the patients 3 presented puncture site hematomas (3%) with no intervention required, 61 patients (61%) underwent the ultrarapid hemostasis protocol in association with a hemostatic pad. Ultrasound follow-up was performed in 20 patients (20%) at 1–2 months with 1 case of occlusion (5%) and 2 of radial stenosis (10%). In all 3 cases proximal radial artery remained patent. CONCLUSION: The dTRA is a safe and feasible access route for angiography and neurointerventions. Using vasodilators prepuncture, we attained a variable increase in the vascular diameter facilitating puncture and reducing the risk of occlusion and vascular spasm. A rapid deflation protocol for postpuncture hemostasis does not significantly increase the hematoma rate.","Rodriguez Caamaño, Isabel; Barranco-Pons, Roger; Klass, Darren; de Dios las Cuevas, Marta; Chirife, Oscar Sabino; Aixut, Sonia",Clin Neuroradiol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00062-021-01039-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34258635/,239

OBJECTIVE: To examine pre-pandemic rates of and pandemic-related change in food insecurity among households with and without dietary restrictions. METHODS: A cross-sectional, panel-based survey of 3200 U.S. women was conducted in April 2020. Pre-pandemic food insecurity and early pandemic-related change in food insecurity were assessed using the adapted Hunger Vital Sign. Weighted, multivariate logistic regression was used to model the odds of pre-pandemic food insecurity and the odds of incident or worsening pandemic-related food insecurity among households with and without dietary restrictions. In models predicting pandemic-related outcomes, interaction effects between race/ethnicity and dietary restrictions were examined. RESULTS: Before the COVID-19 pandemic, households with self-reported food allergy (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2-1.9), celiac disease (aOR: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.4-3.5), or both (aOR: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.2-3.6) were significantly more likely to be food insecure than households without restrictions. Households with dietary restrictions were also significantly more likely to experience incident or worsening food insecurity during the early pandemic (food allergy: aOR: 1.6, 95% CI: 1.3-2.1) (celiac disease: aOR: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.5-3.5) (both: aOR: 2.0, 95% CI: 1.2-3.4). Race/ethnicity was not a significant moderator of the relationship between dietary restrictions and pandemic-related food insecurity. CONCLUSION: Households with dietary restrictions were more likely to experience both pre-pandemic and pandemic-related incident or worsening food insecurity than households without restrictions.

Millions of people were infected and several hundred thousand died of the COVID-19 pandemic across the world. There is no clear targeted drug therapy available for the treatment of the patients. The discovery of vaccines is not enough to curtail its spread and disastrous implications. An instantly qualifying approach is needed to utilize the current drugs and isolated compounds. The purpose of this work is to determine potent inhibitors against the target proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). For this purpose, molecular docking study of pathogenic spike glycoproteins (S), nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N), an envelope protein (E), two drugs i.e., cefixime, etoposide, and a previously isolated compound nebrodenside A is performed. Promising results were obtained via complimentary analysis of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations performed for the complexes of three proteins with etoposide drug. Minimum values were recorded for the docking scores and binding energies of the complexes. These results were further supported by the RMSD, RMSF data for the stability of proteins and ligands. Additionally, ligand properties and ligand-protein contacts were also explained with histograms of every simulation trajectory. The computational studies confirmed that cefixime, etoposide, and nebrodenoside A can be used as potent inhibitors of COVID-19.

The aim of the study was to determine whether these patients have worse outcomes with COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study between 1 March and 30 April 2020 to assess the importance of vitamin D deficiency in older patients with COVID-19. The cohort consisted of patients aged ≥65 years presenting with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 (n=105). All patients were tested for serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels during acute illness. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed via viral reverse transcriptase PCR swab or supporting radiological evidence. COVID-19-positive arm (n=70) was sub-divided into vitamin D-deficient (≤30 nmol/L) (n=39) and -replete groups (n=35). Subgroups were assessed for disease severity using biochemical, radiological and clinical markers. Primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were laboratory features of cytokine storm, thoracic imaging changes and requirement of non-invasive ventilation (NIV). RESULTS: COVID-19-positive arm demonstrated lower median serum 25(OH)D level of 27 nmol/L (IQR=20–47 nmol/L) compared with COVID-19-negative arm, with median level of 52 nmol/L (IQR=31.5–71.5 nmol/L) (p value=0.0008). Among patients with vitamin D deficiency, there was higher peak D-dimer level (1914.00 μgFEU/L vs 1268.00 μgFEU/L) (p=0.034) and higher incidence of NIV support and high dependency unit admission (30.77% vs 9.68%) (p=0.042). No increased mortality was observed between groups. CONCLUSION: Older adults with vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 may demonstrate worse morbidity outcomes.

Despite remarkably successful approaches in predicting the spatiotemporal patterns of the ongoing pandemic, we lack an intrinsic understanding of the travel restriction's effectiveness. We fill this gap by developing a surprisingly simple measure, country distancing, that is analogical to the effective resistance in series and parallel circuits and captures the propagation backbone tree from the outbreak locations globally. This approach enables us to map the effectiveness of travel restrictions to arrival time delay (ATD) or infected case reduction (ICR) systematically. Our method estimates that 50.8% of travel restrictions as of Apr-4 are ineffective, resulting in zero ATD or ICR worldwide.

663625,Natural History and Clinical Course of Symptomatic and Asymptomatic COVID-19 Patients in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,2021-04-29,"OBJECTIVE: Nigeria bears 25% of global malaria burden despite concerted efforts towards its control and elimination. The emergence of drug resistance to first line drugs, artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs), indicates an urgent need for continuous molecular surveillance of drug resistance especially in high burden countries where drug interventions are heavily relied on. This study describes mutations in Plasmodium falciparum genes associated with drug resistance in malaria; Pfk13, Pfmdr1, PfATPase6 and Pfcrt in isolates obtained from 83 symptomatic malaria patients collected in August 2014, aged 1–61 years old from South-west Nigeria. RESULTS: Two Pfmdr1, N86 and Y184 variants were present at a prevalence of 56% and 13.25% of isolates respectively. There was one synonymous (S679S) and two non-synonymous (M699V, S769M) mutations in the PATPase6 gene, while Pfcrt genotype (CVIET), had a prevalence of 45%. The Pfk13 C580Y mutant allele was suspected by allelic discrimination in two samples with mixed genotypes although this could not be validated with independent isolation or additional methods. Our findings call for robust molecular surveillance of antimalarial drug resistance markers in west Africa especially with increased use of antimalarial drugs as prophylaxis for Covid-19.","Tola, Monday; Ajibola, Olumide; Idowu, Emmanuel Taiwo; Omidiji, Olusesan; Awolola, Samson Taiwo; Amambua-Ngwa, Alfred",BMC Res Notes,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13104-020-05334-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33109270/,239

664644,Cardiac surgery services during COVID‐19—what did we learn?,2021-06-14,"As the global severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic expands, genomic epidemiology and whole genome sequencing are being constantly used to investigate its transmissions and evolution. In the backdrop of the global emergence of “variants of concern” (VOCs) during December 2020 and an upsurge in a state in the western part of India since January 2021, whole genome sequencing and analysis of spike protein mutations using sequence and structural approaches was undertaken to identify possible new variants and gauge the fitness of current circulating strains. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the predominant clade in circulation was a distinct newly identified lineage B.1.617 possessing common signature mutations D111D, G142D, L452R, E484Q, D614G and P681R, in the spike protein including within the receptor binding domain (RBD). Of these, the mutations at residue positions 452, 484 and 681 have been reported in other globally circulating lineages. The structural analysis of RBD mutations L452R and E484Q along with P681R in the furin cleavage site, revealed that these may possibly result in increased ACE2 binding and rate of S1-S2 cleavage resulting in better transmissibility. The same two RBD mutations indicated decreased binding to select monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and may affect their neutralization potential. Experimental validation against a wider panel of mAbs, sera from vaccinees and those that recovered from natural infection needs to be studied. The emergence of such local variants through the accumulation of convergent mutations during the COVID-19 second wave needs to be further investigated for their public health impact in the rest of the country and its possibility of becoming a VOC.","Cherian, Sarah; Potdar, Varsha; Jadhav, Santosh; Yadav, Pragya; Gupta, Nivedita; Das, Mousmi; Rakshit, Partha; Singh, Sujeet; Abraham, Priya; Panda, Samiran",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.22.440932,239

The three peptides show greater inhibitory potencies in cellular and mucosal tissue pre-clinical models than the parent sequence and the retro-enantio shows a strengthened proteolytic stability. Since HIV-1 fusion inhibitor peptides need to be embedded in the membrane to properly interact with their viral target, the structural features were determined by NMR spectroscopy in micelles and solved by using restrained molecular dynamics calculations. Both parent and retro-enantio peptides demonstrate a topology compatible with a shared helix–turn–helix conformation and assemble similarly in the membrane maintaining the active conformation needed for its interaction with the viral target site. This study represents a straightforward approach to design new targeted peptides as HIV-1 fusion inhibitors and lead us to define a retro-enantio peptide as a good candidate for pre-exposure prophylaxis against HIV-1.","Gomara, María J.; Perez, Yolanda; Gomez-Gutierrez, Patricia; Herrera, Carolina; Ziprin, Paul; Martinez, Javier P.; Meyerhans, Andreas; Perez, Juan J.; Haro, Isabel",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-71404-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32879375/,239

Ethical guidelines consider allocation of limited resources based on likelihood of survival, frailty, co-morbidities and age. However, the association of frailty with clinical outcomes in older COVID-19 patients remains unclear. Objectives: To determine the association between frailty and short-term mortality in older adults hospitalized for COVID-19. Design: Retrospective single-center observational study. Setting and participants: N = 81 patients with COVID-19 confirmed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), at the Geriatrics department of Imelda general hospital, Belgium. Measurements: Frailty was graded according to the Rockwood Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS). Demographic, biochemical and radiological variables, co-morbidities, symptoms and treatment were extracted from electronic medical records. Results: Participants (N = 48 women, 59%) had a median age of 85 years (range 65 - 97 years), median CFS score of 7 (range 2 - 9), and 42 (52%) were long-term care residents. Within six weeks, eighteen patients died. Mortality was significantly but weakly associated with age (Spearman r = 0.241, P = 0.03) and CFS score (r = 0.282, P = 0.011), baseline lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (r = 0.301, P = 0.009), lymphocyte count (r = -0.262, P = 0.02) and RT-PCR Ct value (r = -0.285, P = 0.015). Mortality was not associated with long-term care residence, dementia, delirium or polypharmacy. In multivariable logistic regression analyses, CFS, LDH and RT-PCR Ct values (but not age) remained independently associated with mortality. Both age and frailty had poor specificity to predict survival. A multivariable model combining age, CFS, LDH and viral load significantly predicted survival. Conclusions and implications: Although their prognosis is worse, even the oldest and most severely frail patients may benefit from hospitalization for COVID-19, if sufficient resources are available.","De Smet, R.; Mellaerts, B.; Vandewinckele, H.; Lybeert, P.; Frans, E.; Ombelet, S.; Lemahieu, W.; Symons, R.; Ho, E.; Frans, J.; Smismans, A.; Laurent, M.

Isolated gastrointestinal manifestation due to COVID-19 presenting as colonic distension is uncommon. Colonic ileus from COVID-19 infection presents as dilatation on imaging, with the risk of subsequent ischemia and perforation if not recognized and treated promptly. There is no consensus on the treatment modality for COVID-19-related colitis, however, COVID-19-targeted medications in conjunction with surgical intervention have been performed for management. We present a case of a 73-year-old man who presented with abdominal pain, distention, and diarrhea. He tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and was found to have marked dilatation of the colon on imaging. He was initially given convalescent plasma to reduce inflammatory markers, as tocilizumab was contraindicated due to suspected bowel obstruction. Once more stable, he underwent surgical intervention followed by tocilizumab infusion. Pathological specimens of the colon demonstrated hemorrhagic colitis with microthrombi suggestive of COVID-19-related colitis. Recognizing COVID-19-related colitis allows for timely diagnosis and management with targeted interventions in addition to surgery, which may prevent perforation. We suggest convalescent plasma followed by the formation of colostomy and finally infusion of tocilizumab as a feasible option for the treatment of COVID-19-related colitis. However, further research is needed in order to fully understand this entity and provide guidance for its management.","Shaikh, Danial H; Patel, Harish; Makker, Jasbir; Badipatla, Kanthi; Chilimuri, Sridhar",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.13236; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33728185/,239

As any test, RT-PCR provides false negative results that can be rectified by clinicians by confronting clinical, biological and imaging data. The combination of RT-PCR and chest-CT could improve diagnosis performance, but this would requires considerable resources for its rapid use in all patients with suspected COVID-19. The potential contribution of machine learning in this situation has not been fully evaluated. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate machine learning models using routine clinical and laboratory data to improve the performance of RT-PCR and chest-CT for COVID-19 diagnosis among post-emergency hospitalized patients. All adults admitted to the ED for suspected COVID-19, and then hospitalized at Rennes academic hospital, France, between March 20, 2020 and May 5, 2020 were included in the study. Three model types were created: logistic regression, random forest, and neural network. Each model was trained to diagnose COVID-19 using different sets of variables. Area under the receiving operator characteristics curve (AUC) was the primary outcome to evaluate model’s performances. 536 patients were included in the study: 106 in the COVID group, 430 in the NOT-COVID group. The AUC values of chest-CT and RT-PCR increased from 0.778 to 0.892 and from 0.852 to 0.930, respectively, with the contribution of machine learning.

Here we characterized the impact of VEEV on signaling pathways regulating cell death in human primary astrocytes. VEEV productively infected primary astrocytes and caused an upregulation of early growth response 1 (EGR1) gene expression at 9 and 18 h post infection. EGR1 induction was dependent on extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) and protein kinase R (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), but not on p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) or phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling. Knockdown of EGR1 significantly reduced VEEV-induced apoptosis and impacted viral replication. Knockdown of ERK1/2 or PERK significantly reduced EGR1 gene expression, dramatically reduced viral replication, and increased cell survival as well as rescued cells from VEEV-induced apoptosis. These data indicate that EGR1 activation and subsequent cell death are regulated through ERK and PERK pathways in VEEV infected primary astrocytes.","Dahal, Bibha; Lin, Shih-Chao; Carey, Brian D.; Jacobs, Jonathan L.; Dinman, Jonathan D.; van Hoek, Monique L.; Adams, Andre A.; Kehn-Hall, Kylene",Virology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682219303058; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2019.10.016; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682219303058; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31733451/,239

The ACE deletion/deletion(D/D)genotype represents a marker of thrombosis in subjects apparently without predisposing factors and/or traditional thrombophilic alterations and increases the risk of venous thromboembolism in subjects in whom a thrombogenic condition occurs. Thrombosis seems to play a role very early in the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, in particular in those with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. The counterbalance between angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 activities in COVID-19 disease may play a crucial role in the thrombo-inflammatory process. We hypothesised that a genetic predisposition could condition the severity and complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Materials and methods: We conducted a spontaneous, single centre observational study in the Sub-Intensive Care Unit of A.O.R.N. Ospedali dei Colli, Cotugno Hospital, Naples (Italy). In this study, we performed genetic screening for ACE D/D genotype and other thrombophilic mutations in 20 patients affected by ARDS related to COVID-19 pneumonia, compared to 19 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Results: All tested patients had multiple polymorphisms and, in particular, a significantly higher prevalence of ACE D/D polymorphism in severe COVID-19 patients Conclusion: We found that the majority of patients who tested positive for ACE D-D genotype and who were not associated with other risk factors for VTE showed an evolution to ARDS. This finding could have a predicting role in the selection of patients more prone to developing severe COVID-19 during clinical observation in emergency department.","Annunziata, Anna; Coppola, Antonietta; Di Spirito, Valentina; Cauteruccio, Rosa; Marotta, Antonella; Micco, Pierpaolo Di; Fiorentino, Giuseppe",Medicina (Kaunas),https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina57080844; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34441050/,239

Further knowledge of its various pathogenic mechanisms is essential, including coagulation disorders. Monoclonal gammopathy is characterized by the overproduction of a monoclonal immunoglobulin caused by clonal proliferation. Using a postmortem study of ultrasound-guided percutaneous core biopsies, the aim of this report is to present our observations on the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection pathology associated with monoclonal gammopathy. The clinical presentation was acute renal failure. Pathological findings revealed kappa light chain cast nephropathy. SARS-CoV-2 immunohistochemistry was positive in some renal tubular cells. Another notable finding was the presence of a high density of alveolar megakaryocytes, which probably explained the final outcome (acute cerebrovascular disease). Immunohistochemical study for SARS-CoV-2 does not verify the pathogenic effect of the virus and thus its contribution to the acute kidney injury.","MªCarmen, González-García; Pablo, Pérez Montero; Manuela, Pena Burgos Eva; Cristina, Vega Cabrera; Teresa, Hernández Cabrero; Begoña, Rivas Becerra; Laura, Yébenes; David, Hardisson",Rev Esp Patol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1699885521000714?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1699885521000714,239

METHODS: A sample of 1929 emerging adults (M(age) = 24.17, SD(age) = 2.75; 71.6% girls) completed an online survey about their sexting behaviors during the national lockdown in Italy. Data were gathered in April/May 2020, from 6th to 11th week of home confinement due to COVID-19 pandemic. Hierarchical regression and mediation analyses were performed. RESULTS: Pandemic-related stress directly predicted only risky and emotional sexting. Experimental and emotional sexting were positively predicted by social support, and negatively predicted by turning to religion. Risky and emotional sexting were positively predicted by avoidance, and negatively predicted by problem solving. Adaptive coping (i.e., social support) mediated the relationships from pandemic-related stress to both experimental and emotional sexting. Maladaptive coping (i.e., avoidance and problem solving) mediated the relationships from pandemic related-stress to risky and emotional sexting. CONCLUSIONS: Sexting was a coping tool during COVID-19 lockdown, showing both adaptive and maladaptive facets.

In the past 2 years, >1.7 million people have been infected. In light of the current epidemic, with millions of people in North and South America at risk, efforts to rapidly develop effective vaccines have increased. Here, we focus on CHIKV vaccines that use viral-vector technologies. This group of vaccine candidates shares an ability to potently induce humoral and cellular immune responses by use of highly attenuated and safe vaccine backbones. So far, well-described vectors such as modified vaccinia virus Ankara, complex adenovirus, vesicular stomatitis virus, alphavirus-based chimeras, and measles vaccine Schwarz strain (MV/Schw) have been described as potential vaccines. We summarize here the recent data on these experimental vaccines, with a focus on the preclinical and clinical activities on the MV/Schw-based candidate, which is the first CHIKV-vectored vaccine that has completed a clinical trial.","Ramsauer, Katrin; Tangy, Frédéric",J Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27920181/,239

Concerns regarding COVID-19-related risks to patients and healthcare workers with the re-introduction of major complex minimally invasive and open surgery have been raised. This study examines the COVID-19 related risks to patients and healthcare workers following the re-introduction of major oesophago-gastric (EG) surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was an international, multi-centre, observational study of consecutive patients treated by open and minimally invasive oesophagectomy and gastrectomy for malignant or benign disease. Patients were recruited from nine European centres serving regions with a high population incidence of COVID-19 between 1 May and 1 July 2020. The primary endpoint was 30-day COVID-19-related mortality. All staff involved in the operative care of patients were invited to complete a health-related survey to assess the incidence of COVID-19 in this group. RESULTS: In total, 158 patients were included in the study (71 oesophagectomy, 82 gastrectomy). Overall, 87 patients (57%) underwent MIS (59 oesophagectomy, 28 gastrectomy). A total of 403 staff were eligible for inclusion, of whom 313 (78%) completed the health survey. Approaches to mitigate against the risks of COVID-19 for patients and staff varied amongst centres. No patients developed COVID-19 in the post-operative period. Two healthcare workers developed self-limiting COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Precautions to minimise the risk of COVID-19 infection have enabled the safe re-introduction of minimally invasive and open EG surgery for both patients and staff. Further studies are necessary to determine the minimum requirements for mitigations against COVID-19.

In this study, we evaluated the antiviral activity of five phlorotannins isolated from Ecklonia cava (E. cava) against PEDV. In vitro antiviral activity was tested using two different assay strategies: (1) blockage of the binding of virus to cells (simultaneous-treatment assay) and (2) inhibition of viral replication (post-treatment assay). In simultaneous-treatment assay, compounds 2–5 except compound 1 exhibited antiviral activities of a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) with the ranging from 10.8 ± 1.4 to 22.5 ± 2.2 μM against PEDV. Compounds 1–5 were completely blocked binding of viral spike protein to sialic acids at less than 36.6 μM concentrations by hemagglutination inhibition. Moreover, compounds 4 and 5 of five phlorotannins inhibited viral replication with IC(50) values of 12.2 ± 2.8 and 14.6 ± 1.3 μM in the post-treatment assay, respectively. During virus replication steps, compounds 4 and 5 exhibited stronger inhibition of viral RNA and viral protein synthesis in late stages (18 and 24 h) than in early stages (6 and 12 h). Interestingly, compounds 4 and 5 inhibited both viral entry by hemagglutination inhibition and viral replication by inhibition of viral RNA and viral protein synthesis, but not viral protease. These results suggest that compounds isolated from E. cava have strong antiviral activity against PEDV, inhibiting viral entry and/or viral replication, and may be developed into natural therapeutic drugs against coronavirus infection.","Kwon, Hyung-Jun; Ryu, Young Bae; Kim, Young-Min; Song, Naaleum; Kim, Cha Young; Rho, Mun-Chual; Jeong, Jae-Ho; Cho, Kyoung-Oh; Lee, Woo Song; Park, Su-Jin",Bioorg Med Chem,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0968089613004288; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23746631/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2013.04.085; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968089613004288,239

Interview data from 30 African American adolescents with overweight and obesity (Mage = 15.30 ± 2.18; MBMI%-ile = 96.7 ± 3.90) were transcribed and coded for themes using inductive and deductive approaches by two independent coders. Inter-rater reliability was acceptable (r = 0.70–0.80) and discrepancies were resolved to 100% agreement. The themes were guided by the Relapse Prevention Model, which focuses on assessing barriers of overall coping capacity in high stress situations that may undermine health behavior change (physical activity, diet, weight loss). Prominent themes included feeling stressed primarily in response to relationship conflicts within the family and among peers, school responsibilities, and negative emotions (anxiety, depression, anger). A mix of themes emerged related to coping strategies ranging from cognitive reframing and distraction to avoidant coping. Recommendations for future programs include addressing sources of stress and providing supportive resources, as well as embracing broader systems such as neighborhoods and communities. Implications for future intervention studies are discussed.","Quattlebaum, Mary; Kipp, Colby; Wilson, Dawn K.; Sweeney, Allison; Loncar, Haylee; Brown, Asia; Levine, Sydney; Zarrett, Nicole",Nutrients,https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13072247; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34210069/,239

In this study, NFP-1, a new water-soluble polysaccharidewith a purity of 97.8%, was purified from water extract of Nervilia fordii by DEAE-cellulose and Sephadex G-100 chromatography. NFP-1 has a relative molecular weight of 950 kDa determined by high performance gel-permeation chromatography (HPGPC). Its monosaccharide compositions were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) after pre-column derivatizing its hydrolysate with 1-phenyl-3-methyl-5-pyrazolone (PMP). NFP-1 mainly consists of galactose, arabinose, rhamnose, and galacturonic acid. Based on FT-IR, methylation and GC–MS analysis, and NMR, the structure unit of NFP-1 was established as →4)-α-Rhap-(2→ 4)-α-GalpA-(1→2)-α-Rhap-(1→2)-α-Rhap-(4→1)-β-Galp-T containing two branch chains of →2,4)-α-Rhap-(1→5)-α-Araf-(1→3)-α-Araf-(1→, and →2,4)-α-Rhap-(1→4)-β-Galp-(1→. The immunomodulatory assays revealed the dual-functionalities of NFP-1. NFP-1 could significantly induce the secretion of nitric oxide (NO), and promote the secretions of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β in RAW264.7 macrophages. NFP-1 could also significantly inhibit the production of NO, depress the secretions of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β in RAW264.7 macrophages activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and promote the production of IL-10 meanwhile.

Here we describe the discovery of myricetin, a flavonoid found in many food sources, as a non-peptidomimetic and covalent inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 3CL(pro). Crystal structures of the protease bound with myricetin and its derivatives unexpectedly revealed that the pyrogallol group worked as an electrophile to covalently modify the catalytic cysteine. Kinetic and selectivity characterization together with theoretical calculations comprehensively illustrated the covalent binding mechanism of myricetin with the protease and demonstrated that the pyrogallol can serve as an electrophile warhead. Structure-based optimization of myricetin led to the discovery of derivatives with good antiviral activity and the potential of oral administration. These results provide detailed mechanistic insights into the covalent mode of action by pyrogallol-containing natural products and a template for design of non-peptidomimetic covalent inhibitors against 3CL(pro)s, highlighting the potential of pyrogallol as an alternative warhead in design of targeted covalent ligands.","Su, Haixia; Yao, Sheng; Zhao, Wenfeng; Zhang, Yumin; Liu, Jia; Shao, Qiang; Wang, Qingxing; Li, Minjun; Xie, Hang; Shang, Weijuan; Ke, Changqiang; Feng, Lu; Jiang, Xiangrui; Shen, Jingshan; Xiao, Gengfu; Jiang, Hualiang; Zhang, Leike; Ye, Yang; Xu, Yechun",Nat Commun,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-23751-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34131140/,239

In fact, several governments had to ration hand sanitizers in the retail outlets and over the counter chemist shops. Additionally, Indian government has put a cap on the prices of hand sanitizers. Currently, large sections of global and Indian population are grappling under financial crises. Therefore, mandatory hand sanitization has made an unwelcoming, yet unavoidable addition to the already-hard-to-maintain-grocery-list. Here, we have compared the anti-microbial efficacy of Patanjali Hand Sanitizer (PHS), developed and marketed by Patanjali Ayurved Ltd. (an India-based food and herbal medicine company) with one of the topmost hand sanitizers currently used under clinical set-ups. PHS has anti-microbial efficacy comparable to that of the standard hand sanitizer. Besides, disc diffusion and time-dependent thumb print assays showed that PHS has longer retentivity on the applied surfaces, suggesting lesser consumption of the sanitizer and concomitant relaxation on the monthly grocery budget. Observed anti-bacterial potency of PHS is attributed to the disruption of bacterial cell membrane, as employed by alcohol-based hand sanitizers. A rough estimation revealed that PHS is ~ 4.3 times cost effective than the standard hand sanitizer used as the positive control in this study. Taken together, PHS is a suitable alternative for existing hand sanitizers available in the market that can relax the demand–supply strain and soften significantly the burden of monthly expenditure on hand sanitizers.","Balkrishna, Acharya; Singh, Kanchan; Singh, Hoshiyar; Haldar, Swati; Varshney, Anurag",AMB Express,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33259026/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13568-020-01151-y,239

We developed a bioluminescence-based bioreporter to interrogate the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 viral spike protein and its host entry receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)1-3. The bioreporter assay is based on a Nanoluciferase complementation reporter, composed of two subunits, Large BiT and Small BiT, fused to the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and ACE2 ectodomain, respectively. Using this bioreporter, we uncovered critical host and viral determinants of the interaction, including a role for glycosylation of asparagine residues within the RBD in mediating successful viral entry. We also demonstrate the importance of N-linked glycosylation to RBD’s antigenicity and immunogenicity. Our study demonstrates the versatility of our bioreporter in mapping key residues mediating viral entry as well as screening inhibitors of the ACE2-RBD interaction. Our findings point towards targeting RBD glycosylation for therapeutic and vaccine strategies against SARS-CoV-2.","Azad, Taha; Singaravelu, Ragunath; Taha, Zaid; Jamieson, Taylor R.; Boulton, Stephen; Crupi, Mathieu J.F.; Martin, Nikolas T.; Brown, Emily E.F.; Poutou, Joanna; Ghahremani, Mina; Pelin, Adrian; Nouri, Kazem; Rezaei, Reza; Marshall, Christopher Boyd; Enomoto, Masahiro; Arulanandam, Rozanne; Alluqmani, Nouf; Samson, Reuben; Gingras, Anne-Claude; Cameron, D.

Cardiovascular disease is a risk factor for adverse outcomes in COVID-19, but baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in particular has not been evaluated thoroughly in this context. METHODS: We analyzed patients in our state's largest health system who were diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 20 and May 15, 2020. Inclusion required an available echocardiogram within one year prior to diagnosis. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. LVEF was analyzed both as a continuous variable and using a cutoff of 40%. RESULTS: Among 396 patients (67±16 years, 191 [48%] male, 235 [59%] Black, 59 [15%] LVEF ≤40%), 289 (73%) required hospital admission, and 116 (29%) died during 85±63 days of follow-up. Echocardiograms, performed a median of 57 (IQR 11-122) days prior to COVID-19 diagnosis, showed a similar distribution of LVEF between survivors and decedents (p=0.84). Receiver operator characteristic analysis revealed no predictive ability of LVEF for mortality, and there was no difference in survival among those with LVEF ≤40% vs. >40% (p=0.49). Multivariable analysis did not change these relationships. Similarly, there was no difference in LVEF based on whether the patient required hospital admission (56±13 vs. 55±13, p=0.38), and patients with a depressed LVEF did not require admission more frequently than their preserved-LVEF peers (p=0.87). A premorbid history of dyspnea consistent with symptomatic heart failure was not associated with mortality (p=0.74). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients diagnosed with COVID-19, pre-COVID-19 LVEF was not a risk factor for death or hospitalization.","Morin, Daniel P.; Manzo, Marc A.; Pantlin, Peter G.; Verma, Rashmi; Bober, Robert M.; Krim, Selim R.; Lavie, Carl J.; Qamruddin, Salima; Shah, Sangeeta; Soto, José D.

681075,30 Patient and physician opinion of virtual care in the oncology department of an Irish tertiary care centre in the era of Covid-19,2021-06-30,"Background: Timely assessment of COVID-19 severity is crucial for the rapid provision of appropriate treatments. Definitive criteria for the early identification of severe COVID-19 cases that require intensive care unit admission are lacking. Methods: This was a single-center, retrospective case-control study of 95 consecutive adults admitted to the intensive care unit (cases) or a medical ward (controls) for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Clinical data were collected and changes in laboratory test results were calculated between presentation at the emergency department and admission. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression was performed to calculate odds ratios for intensive care unit admission according to changes in laboratory variables. Results: Of the 95 adults with COVID-19, 25 were admitted to intensive care and 70 to a medical ward after a median 6 h stay in the emergency department. During this interval, neutrophil counts increased in cases and decreased in controls (median, 934 vs. −295 × 10(6)/L; P = 0.006), while lymphocyte counts decreased in cases and increased in controls (median, −184 vs. 109 × 10(6)/L; P < 0.001). In cases, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio increased 6-fold and the urea-to-creatinine ratio increased 20-fold during the emergency department stay, but these ratios did not change in controls (P < 0.001 for both comparisons). By multivariable logistic regression, short-term increases in the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.16–1.76) and urea-to-creatinine ratio (OR = 1.72; 95% CI, 1.20–2.66) were independent predictors of intensive care unit admission. Conclusion: Short-time changes in neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and urea-to-creatinine ratio emerged as stand-alone parameters able to identify patients with aggressive disease at an early stage.","Solimando, Antonio Giovanni; Susca, Nicola; Borrelli, Paola; Prete, Marcella; Lauletta, Gianfranco; Pappagallo, Fabrizio; Buono, Roberta; Inglese, Gianfranco; Forina, Bianca Maria; Bochicchio, Donatello; Capobianco, Martina; Carrieri, Valeria; Cicco, Sebastiano; Leone, Patrizia; Silvestris, Nicola; Saracino, Annalisa; Ria, Roberto; Procacci, Vito; Migliore, Giovanni; Vacca, Angelo; Racanelli, Vito",Front Med (Lausanne),https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2020.625176; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33553217/,239

These include the impact of specific medications on outcomes and the antibody response after COVID-19 vaccination. RECENT FINDINGS: We summarized the current literature related to COVID-19 outcomes in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases in rheumatology, gastroenterology, dermatology, and neurology. Overall, we found either no difference or modest differences in risk for severe COVID-19 for people with immune-mediated diseases compared with the general population. When considering disease-specific factors, glucocorticoid use and underlying immune-mediated disease activity were generally associated with worse outcomes. Specific medications varied in associations: tumor necrosis factor inhibitors generally had lower odds for severe COVID-19 outcomes, whereas rituximab use generally had higher odds for severe outcomes. We also detailed the recent reports of antibody response to COVID-19 vaccination in people with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. SUMMARY: Investigations of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases across several organ systems have offered important insight into the COVID-19 disease course. Overall, these studies have provided reassurance to patients and clinicians while also identifying groups who may be at higher risk for poor outcomes.","Sparks, Jeffrey A.; Wallace, Zachary S.; Robinson, Philip C.",Curr Opin Rheumatol,https://doi.org/10.1097/bor.0000000000000812; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34171857/,239

Few studies examine the implementation of these standards; whether and how they affect health through changes to built-environment design, construction, and operations. This study reviews a set of sustainability and HBE standards, based on a qualitative analysis of standard documents, standard and socio-technical literature on normalization and negotiation, and interviews with 31 practitioners from four geographical regions. The analysis indicates that standards can impact individual, organizational, and market-scale definitions of an HBE. Some changes to practice are identified, such as procurement and internal layout decisions. There is more limited evidence of changes to dominant, short-term decision-making practices related to cost control and user engagement in operational decisions. HBE standards risk establishing narrow definitions of health and wellbeing focused on building occupants rather than promoting broader, contextually situated, principles of equity, inclusion, and ecosystem functioning crucial for health. There is a need to improve sustainability and HBE standards to take better account of local contexts and promote systems thinking. Further examination of dominant collective negotiation processes is required to identify opportunities to better embed standards within organizational practice.","Callway, Rosalie; Pineo, Helen; Moore, Gemma",Sustainability,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33408880/; https://doi.org/10.3390/su12239884,239

However, the existing ethical review system and regulations have their limitations to meet the demand for a prompt and efficient epidemic control. Since the research under the public health emergency is different from that carried out in familiar situations to design and implementation, the strategy for a satisfactory ERC response should balance the duty of protecting individual participants as well as the special public needs derived from the disease control. It is suggested that the ethical review‐related regulations need to be updated, and a unified supervision system to the overall ERC is required. ERC collaboration, capacity‐improving and efficiency‐improving measures need to be taken. With respect to the reviewing guidelines, it is suggested that the international norms should be explained with more consideration of the local condition and the exceptional circumstances in this public health emergency.

We assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on neurotrauma presentations in the first three months following shutdown throughout Pennsylvania. METHODS The Pennsylvania Trauma Systems Foundation (PTSF) was queried for registry data from the Pennsylvania Trauma Outcomes Study (PTOS) between March 12th and June 5th in each year from 2017 to 2020. RESULTS Following the COVID-19 shutdown, there was a 27% reduction in neurotrauma volume, from 2680 cases in 2017 to 2018 cases in 2020, and a 28.8% reduction in TBI volume. There was no significant difference in neurotrauma phenotype incurred relative to total cases. Injury mechanism was less likely to be motor vehicle collision (MVC) and more likely due to falls, gunshot wound, and recreational vehicle accidents (p<0.05). Location of injury was less likely on roads and public locations and more likely at indoor private locations (p<0.05). The proportion of neurotrauma patients with blood alcohol concentration (BAC) > 0.08 g/dL was reduced in 2020 (11.4% vs 9.0%; p < 0.05). Mortality rate was higher during 2020 compared to pre-COVID years (7.7% vs 6.4%; p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS Statewide shutdown decreased neurotrauma volume and alcohol-related trauma while increasing low-impact traumas and gunshot wounds, with a shift toward injuries occurring in private, indoor locations. Together, these changes increased mortality rate. However, there was not a change in the types of injuries sustained.","Algattas, Hanna N; McCarthy, David; Kujawski, Brandon; Agarwal, Nitin; Brown, Joshua; Forsythe, Raquel M; Leonardo, Jody; Walsh, Kevin; Gross, Bradley A; Friedlander, Robert M; Okonkwo, David O; Whiting, Donald; Miele, Vincent J",World neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2021.04.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33857673/,239

TMPRSS2 is an attractive target and has received attention for the development of drugs against SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome. Starting with comparative structural modeling and a binding model analysis, we developed an efficient pharmacophore-based approach and applied a large-scale in silico database screening for small-molecule inhibitors against TMPRSS2. The hits were evaluated in the TMPRSS2 biochemical assay and the SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped particle entry assay. A number of novel inhibitors were identified, providing starting points for the further development of drug candidates for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019.","Hu, Xin; Shrimp, Jonathan H.; Guo, Hui; Xu, Miao; Chen, Catherine Z.; Zhu, Wei; Zakharov, Alexey V.; Jain, Sankalp; Shinn, Paul; Simeonov, Anton; Hall, Matthew D.; Shen, Min",ACS Pharmacol Transl Sci,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsptsci.0c00221; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34136758/,239

Makkah annually receives three million pilgrims who perform Hajj. Although precautionary measures have been taken in Saudi Arabia to slow down the spread of COVID-19, such as locking down the most affected cities, practicing social distancing, and applying the infection-control precautions, the number of cases has increased. The total confirmed number of cases in Makkah was 10,709 with 127 deaths as of May 16, 2020. Aims of the study: Forecasting the COVID-19 progression in the city of Makkah will help the policymakers decide if the Hajj will be able to operate this year. Thus, to see a clear picture of the fight against COVID-19 for the economy and healthcare industry in Saudi Arabia, specifically in Makkah, the SIR model will predict COVID-19 progression in the city of Makkah. Method: The Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered (SIR) model has been used to track the transmission dynamics and growth among the city of Makkah. The growth index was calculated, according to the data from March 16 until May 9. The estimated vital epidemiological parameters, such as forecasting works and transmission rates, were done. Result: The data showed an interesting result about the peak of the disease progression. It is projected to occur around the 12th day after running the model. According to the model, the peak time will be around the 22nd of May. Then, the number of cases will start to decrease. Conclusion: Using the SIR model, the result predicts the disease progression peak and an estimated end of COVID-19 in the city of Makkah to help the policymakers decide if the Hajj will be able to operate this year.","Mujallad, A.

Some studies have suggested that physiological and ecological factors may be associated with Hendra virus infection in flying-foxes in Australia; however, it is essential to understand the normal range and seasonal variability of physiological biomarkers before seeking physiological associations with infection status. We aimed to measure a suite of physiological biomarkers in P. alecto over time to identify any seasonal fluctuations and to examine possible associations with life-cycle and environmental stressors. We sampled 839 adult P. alecto in the Australian state of Queensland over a 12-month period. The adjusted population means of every assessed hematologic and biochemical parameter were within the reported reference range on every sampling occasion. However, within this range, we identified significant temporal variation in these parameters, in urinary parameters and body condition, which primarily reflected the normal annual life cycle. We found no evident effect of remarkable physiological demands or nutritional stress, and no indication of clinical disease driving any parameter values outside the normal species reference range. Our findings identify underlying temporal physiological changes at the population level that inform epidemiological studies and assessment of putative physiological risk factors driving Hendra virus infection in P. alecto. More broadly, the findings add to the knowledge of Pteropus populations in terms of their relative resistance and resilience to emerging infectious disease.","McMichael, Lee; Edson, Daniel; Mayer, David; McLaughlin, Amanda; Goldspink, Lauren; Vidgen, Miranda E.; Kopp, Steven; Meers, Joanne; Field, Hume",Ecohealth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27026357/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10393-016-1113-0,239

Methods A questionnaire-based study (Descriptive Data) with 53 participants, including ophthalmology residents, fellows in various subspecialties, and trainee optometrists was used. In our study, we used the Reti Eye model, but instead of the usual retina template sheet, we used prominent pathological fundus photographs loaded into the model eye. The study participants were asked to view prominent pathological fundus images printed on a matte finish paper. A circular image was cut and was placed in the Reti Eye model. The candidates were made to perform indirect ophthalmoscopy with a + 20D lens and to fill up a Google image assessment scale questionnaire with characteristics, including pixelation, sharpness, contrast, reflexes, blotchy appearance, and diagnostic confidence, which were then analyzed and depicted. Association between categorical variables was analyzed using Fisher exact test and Chi-square test. A P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All data were analyzed with a statistical software package (SPSS, Version 16.0 for Windows).

688244,This Month in JAAD International: November 2021: COVID-19 and hair loss,2021-09-10,"Abstract Pathogens and eucaryotic cells are active partners during the process of pathogenicity. To gain access to enterocytes and to cross the epithelial membrane, many enterovirulent microorganisms interact with the brush border membrane-associated components as receptors. Recent reports provide evidence that intestinal cell differentiation plays a role in microbial pathogenesis. Human enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) develop their pathogenicity upon infecting enterocytes. To determine if intestinal epithelial cell differentiation influences EPEC pathogenicity, we examined the infection of human intestinal epithelial cells by JPN 15 (pMAR7) [EAF+ eae+] EPEC strain as a function of the cell differentiation. The human embryonic intestinal INT407 cells, the human colonic T84 cells, the human undifferentiated HT-29 cells (HT-29 Std) and two enterocytic cell lines, HT-29 glc−/+ and Caco-2 cells, were used as cellular models. Cells were infected apically with the EPEC strain and the cell-association and cell-entry were examined by quantitative determination using metabolically radiolabeled bacteria, as well as by light, scanning and tranmission electron microscopy. [EAF+ eae+] EPEC bacteria efficiently colonized the cultured human intestinal cells. Diffuse bacterial adhesion occurred to undifferentiated HT-29 Std and INT407 cells, whereas characteristic EPEC cell clusters were observed on fully differentiated enterocytic HT-29 glc−/+ cells and on colonic crypt T84 cells. As shown using the Caco-2 cell line, which spontaneously differentiates in culture, the formation of EPEC clusters increased as a function of the epithelial cell differentiation. In contrast, efficient cell-entry of [EAF+ eae+] EPEC bacteria occured in recently differentiated Caco-2 cells and decreased when the cells were fully differentiated. Our results provide evidence that the intestinal cell differentiation could play a dual role in EPEC pathogenesis: it up-regulates intestinal cell colonization and down-regulates intestinal cell invasion.","Gabastou, Jean Marc; Kernéis, Sophie; Bernet-Camard, Marie Françoise; Barbat, Alain; Coconnier, Marie Hélène; Kaper, James B.; Servin, Alain L.",Differentiation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8522069/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301468109607982; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0301468109607982,239
688694,A novel approach to spinal anaesthesia to avoid aerosol‐generating procedures in a patient with COVID‐19 presenting for laser prostate surgery,2020-10-16,"BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has infected millions of people and has caused more than 2.30 million deaths worldwide to date. Several doubts arise about the role of asymptomatic carriers in virus transmission. During the first epidemic outbreak in Italy a large screening with nasopharyngeal swab (NS) was performed in those who were considered ‘suspect’ for infection. AIMS: To report the results of the SARS-CoV-2 screening in a province in Southern Italy and to provide data on the COVID-19 epidemic and the burden of asymptomatic subjects. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was set up in all healthcare facilities of the province (12 hospitals and 13 sanitary districts: primary, secondary and tertiary centres) with the aim to analyse the results of NS performed on all subjects suspected to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, either because they presented symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection, they were ‘contacts’ of positive subjects, they came from areas with high prevalence or they were healthcare workers. NS were performed and managed as indicated by international guidelines. The specimens were processed for SARS-CoV-2 detection by real-time PCR. RESULTS: A total of 20 325 NS were performed from 13 March to 9 May 2020. Of these, 638 (3.14%) were positive. 470 were asymptomatic, or 75.3% of persons who were positive. They were mostly among ‘contacts’ of symptomatic cases (428 of 470, 91%) and were in domiciliary isolation. Expression of three SARS-CoV-2 genes did not differ between asymptomatic and symptomatic subjects. The strict measures with regard to social distancing led to a continuous decrease in cases during phase 1. CONCLUSIONS: In a large area in Southern Italy, 3.14% (638 of 20 325) of the total subjects tested were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Most of them were asymptomatic (470 of 624, 75.3%), and of these 91% (428 of 470) were ‘close contacts’ of symptomatic subjects. The combination of social distancing together with the systematic screening of close contacts of COVID-19-positive symptomatic subjects seems to be an efficacious approach to limit the spread of the epidemic.","Masarone, Mario; Vaccaro, Emilia; Sciorio, Roberta; Torre, Pietro; Della Vecchia, Antonio; Aglitti, Andrea; Caliulo, Rita; Borrelli, Anna; Persico, Marcello",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-043112; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33972332/,239
689147,Mortality and Advanced Support Requirement for Patients With Cancer With COVID-19: A Mathematical Dynamic Model for Latin America,2020-05-29,"Mitigation of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic requires reliable and accessible laboratory diagnostic services. We evaluated the performance of one LDT and two commercial tests, cobas(R) SARS-CoV-2 (Roche) and Amplidiag(R) COVID-19 (Mobidiag), for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory specimens. 183 specimens collected from suspected COVID-19 patients were studied with all three methods to compare their performance. In relation to the reference standard, which was established as the result obtained by two of the three studied methods, the positive percent agreement (PPA) was highest for cobas(R) test (100%), followed by Amplidiag(R) test and the LDT (98.9%). The negative percent agreement (NPA) was lowest for cobas(R) test (89.4%), followed by Amplidiag(R) test (98.8%) and the highest value was obtained for LDT (100%). The dilution series conducted for specimens, however, suggests significantly higher sensitivity for the cobas(R) assay in comparison with the other two assays and the low NPA value may be due to the same reason. In general, all tested assays performed adequately. Both the time from sample to result and hands-on time per sample were shortest for cobas(R) test. Clinical laboratories need to be prepared for uninterrupted high-throughput testing during the coming months in mitigation of the pandemic. To secure that, it is of critical importance for clinical laboratories to maintain several simultaneous platforms in their SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing.","Mannonen, L.; Kallio-Kokko, H.; Loginov, R.; Jaaskelainen, A.; Jokela, P.; Antikainen, J.; Vare, P.; Kekalainen, E.; Kurkela, S.; Jarva, H.; Lappalainen, M.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.03.20144758; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.03.20144758v1?rss=1,239

As the initial additional annual dose target was set to be 1 mSv or less as a long-term goal, we examined the decision-making process undertaken by the then leaders, particularly the Minister of the Ministry of the Environment (MOE) who was responsible for the final decision. We found that technically based assessment of dose targets, health effects and risk-based approaches justified by scientific experts were not communicated to the then Minister and officials of the MOE before the remediation strategy was decided. We defined how such a decision was made based on leadership theories such as the Role Theory and the Cognitive Resources Theory. Academic leaders could have examined the Windscale accident (UK, 1957), which could be considered as the closest analogue (at least in terms of radionuclide releases) to the 1F accident. Environmental remediation could have been planned and implemented more effectively whilst still maintaining the highest possible safety standards and balancing the environmental and economic burden. Appropriate scientific input should have been provided by academic leaders to political and administrative leaders and such scientific justification should have been disclosed to the general public (especially the residents of Fukushima Prefecture) so that the general public could have developed greater trust in their leaders and have more readily accepted the decisions made.","Takeuchi, Maria R.H.; Hasegawa, Tatsuya; Hardie, Susie M.L.; McKinley, Linda E.; Marquez, Gian Powell B.; Ishihara, Keiichi N.",Heliyon,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06588; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33869838/,239
689331,Bibliometric analysis of global scientific research on Coronavirus (COVID-19),2020-05-23,"BACKGROUND: While southern Africa experiences among the highest mortality rates from respiratory infections, the burden of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in rural areas is poorly understood. METHODS: We implemented facility-based surveillance in Macha, Zambia. Outpatients and inpatients presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI) underwent testing for influenza A, influenza B, and RSV and were prospectively followed for 3 to 5 weeks to assess clinical course. Log-binomial models assessed correlates of infection and clinical severity. RESULTS: Between December 2018 and December 2019, 17% of all outpatients presented with ILI and 16% of inpatients were admitted with an acute respiratory complaint. Influenza viruses and RSV were detected in 17% and 11% of outpatient participants with ILI, and 23% and 16% of inpatient participants with ILI, respectively. Influenza (July–September) and RSV (January-April) prevalence peaks were temporally distinct. RSV (relative risk [RR]: 1.78; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.51–2.11), but not influenza, infection was associated with severe disease among patients with ILI. Underweight patients with ILI were more likely to be infected with influenza A (prevalence ratio [PR]: 1.72; 95% CI 1.04–2.87) and to have severe influenza A infections (RR: 2.49; 95% CI 1.57–3.93). CONCLUSIONS: Populations in rural Zambia bear a sizeable burden of viral respiratory infections and severe disease. The epidemiology of infections in this rural area differs from that reported from urban areas in Zambia.

689895,Ensuring Safety of Operation Warp Speed Vaccines for COVID-19,2020-12-05,"BACKGROUND: In the current coronavirus health crisis, inhaled bronchodilators(IB) have been suggested as a possible treatment for patients hospitalized. Patients with evidence of Covid-19 pneumonia worldwide have been prescribed these medications as part of therapy for the disease, an indication for which this medications could be ineffective taken on account the pathophysiology and mechanisms of disease progression. OBJECTIVE: The main objective was to evaluate whether there is an association between IB use and length of stay. Primary end points were the number of days that a patient stayed in the hospital and death as a final event in a time to event analysis. Pneumonia severity, oxygen requirement, involved drugs, comorbidity, historical or current respiratory diagnoses and other drugs prescribed to treat coronavirus pneumonia were also evaluated. METHODS: A descriptive, observational, cross-sectional study was performed in this tertiary hospital in Madrid (Spain). Data were obtained regarding patients hospitalized with Covid-19, excluding those who were intubated. The primary and secondary outcomes such as duration of hospitalization and death were compared in patients who received IB with those in patients who did not. RESULTS: 327 patients were evaluated, mean age was 64.4±15.8 years. Median length of hospitalization stay was 10 days. Of them 292 (89.3%) overcame the disease, the remaining 35 died. Patients who had received IB did not have less mortality rate (odds ratio 0.839; 95% CI: 0.401 to 1.752) and less hospitalization period when compared with patients who did not received IB (odds ratio 1.280; 95% CI: 0.813 to 2.027). There was no significant association between IB use and recovery or death. Hypertension and diabetes were the most common comorbidities. The prevalence of chronic respiratory disease in our cohort was low (21.1%). Anticholinergics were the IB more frequently prescribed for Covid-19 pneumonia. Better response in patients treated with inhaled corticosteroids was not observed. CONCLUSION: Off-label indication of inhaled-bronchodilators for Covid-19 patients are common in admitted patients. Taken on account our results, the use of IB for coronavirus pneumonia apparently is not associated with a significantly patient´s improvement. Our study confirms the hypothesis that inhaled bronchodilators do not improve clinical outcomes or reduce the risk of Covid-19 mortality. This could be due to the fact that the virus mainly affects the lung parenchyma and the pulmonary vasculature and probably not the airway. More researches are necessary in order to fill the gap in evidence for this new indication.","Villamañán, Elena; Sobrino, Carmen; Carpio, Carlos; Moreno, Marta; Arancón, Ana; Lara, Catalina; Pérez, Ester; Jiménez, Carlos; Zamarrón, Ester; Jiménez-Nácher, Inmaculada; Herrero, Alicia; Álvarez-Sala, Rodolfo",Pulm Pharmacol Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34129946/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1094553921000195?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pupt.2021.102007; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1094553921000195,239
690086,The psychological effects of nursing interventions on patients with suspected COVID-19 during isolation,2021,"Schistosomiasis remains a public health problem in many developing countries around the world. After the founding of The People's Republic of China, from 1949 till date, all levels of government, from central to local, have been attaching great importance to schistosomiasis control in The People's Republic of China. With considerable policy support and resources mobilization, the national schistosomiasis control programmes have been implemented during the past 65 years. Here, we summarize the successful experience of schistosomiasis control during the process. Recommendations for the future management of the Chinese national schistosomiasis elimination programme are put forward after considering the remaining challenges, shortcomings and lessons learnt from 65 years of schistosomiasis control drives in The People's Republic of China. They will help to sustain past achievements, foster the attainment of the ultimate goal of schistosomiasis elimination for the country and provide reference for schistosomiasis control programme in other countries.","Zhu, H.; Yap, P.; Utzinger, J.; Jia, T.-W.; Li, S.-Z.; Huang, X.-B.; Cai, S.-X.",Adv Parasitol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27137452/; https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.apar.2016.03.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0065308X16300276; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065308X16300276,239
690088,A COVID-19 screening tool for oncology telephone triage,2020-08-28,"Background: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic broke out in Wuhan, China, and it spread rapidly. Since January 23, 2020, China has launched a series of unusual and strict measures, including the lockdown of Wuhan city to contain this highly contagious disease. We collected the epidemiological data to analyze the trend of this epidemic in China. Methods: We closely tracked the Chinese and global official websites to collect the epidemiological information about COVID-19. The number of total and daily new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China was presented to illustrate the trend of this epidemic. Results: On January 23, 2020, 835 confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported in China. On February 6, 2020, there were 31211 cases. By February 20, 2020, the number reached as high as 75,993. Most cases were distributed in and around Wuhan, Hubei province. Since January 23, 2020, the number of daily new cases in China except Hubei province reached a peak of 890 on the eleventh day and then it declined to a low level of 34 within two full-length incubation periods (28 days), and the number of daily new cases in Hubei also started to decrease on the twelfth day, from 3156 on February 4, 2020 to 955 on February 15, 2020. Conclusion: The COVID-19 epidemic has been primarily contained in China. The battle against this epidemic in China has provided valuable experiences for the rest of the world. Strict measures need to be taken as earlier as possible to prevent its spread.","Lin, Bilin; Zhong, Huanhuan; Ni, Yueyan; Liu, Lulu; Zhong, Jinjin; Su, Xin",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.13.20035642,239
690585,Estimation of case-fatality rate in COVID-19 patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus in the New York State,2020-08-23,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: COVID-19 and the aging of the Japanese population are increasing the number of people requiring peritoneal dialysis at home. However, the rate of computer system utilization among the elderly is low in Japan, and the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) of Japan is currently considering permission for telemedicine. Therefore, home care support systems for home peritoneal dialysis patients are not sufficient, and even if a patient desires home medical care it may not be possible. The MHLW emphasized the need for home care patients to share information with medical institutions and improve quality of life (QOL), including COVID-19 measures. Therefore, we have built a system that allows home-based peritoneal dialysis patients and medical institutions to share medical information and provide home-based care with peace of mind. Here, we also discuss evaluation of the developed system. METHOD: A system for sharing medical information was developed in the PHP programming language on a personal computer system using Microsoft Azure cloud services, including databases and a social networking service (SNS). In the developed system, medical information, affected area, and photographs of meal contents for each patient can be uploaded and visually confirmed. The patient’s vital records can also be visually confirmed on a graph. In addition, it is possible for patients to share opinions and treatment schedules with the medical staff of medical institutions. The developed system was evaluated by 12 simulated patients consisting of one woman and four men in their 20s, two men in their 30s, one woman and one man in their 40s, and one woman and two men in their 50s. The evaluation items were task achievement and Web usability evaluation scale (WUS). The characteristics of each age group were analyzed according to the WUS. The medical information in this system was shared using SNS, which could only be accessed by invitation. RESULTS: The information exchange system allowed the medical staff at the institute to receive and respond to the opinions of patients. In addition, medical staff were able to share important patient data. Figure 1 shows an example of the developed system displayed on the patient side (a) and on the medical staff side (b) at the institute. The patient filled in each item and uploaded photographs if necessary. The medical staff at the institute were able to view the medical information and uploaded photographs of each patient. One subject required a manual to operate the system, but the task completion rate was 100%. The system developed in this study could also be used by patients in age groups unfamiliar with personal computers. With the continued adoption of Internet access, the developed system built using a web application framework has been well received by patients. The WUS evaluation results are shown in Fig. 2. Subjects in their 20s showed the greatest increase in overall judgment of 4.0 in the 5-point WUS. The item showing differences between age groups was “display.” The standard deviation of “useful” was small, about 3.5 for all age groups. Using the system a second time was easier for the users than the first time. In addition, clinical evaluations showed that use of this system allowed home-based patients to be treated in the same way as those in hospital. CONCLUSION: When using the system developed in this study, there was no relationship between age group and task achievement. The overall result of the 5-point WUS was very high (4.0). The system developed here can be recommended for use by home patients. The patient was able to receive almost the same treatment as in the hospital while at home. As a result, the system developed here can be used for treatment of peritoneal dialysis patients at home.","Okawa, Akiko; Umeda, Tokuo; Kobayashi, Natsumi",Nephrol Dial Transplant,https://doi.org/10.1093/ndt/gfab113.003,239
