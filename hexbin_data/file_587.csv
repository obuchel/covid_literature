33659,Gastrointestinal complications of secondary immunodeficiency syndromes,2009-05-15,"Human resource allocation decisions have a direct impact on the performance of a business process. Many approaches to optimal resource allocation have been proposed in the Business Process Management community. The majority of these approaches aim to optimise process performance; hence, recommend activities to experienced employees. To remain competitive, modern organisations also need to grow the capabilities of their employees and offer them upskilling opportunities. In this article, we propose an approach for recommending unfamiliar activities to employees by comparing their work histories with work histories of other similar employees. The aim of the proposed approach is to put employees on a gradual path of multi-skilling whereby they are provided with an opportunity to perform unfamiliar process activities and thus gain their experience through learning-by-doing. The approach is based on the analysis of process execution data and has been implemented. In the evaluation, we compared recommendations provided by the approach with actual activity executions of different employees recorded in process data. The evaluation demonstrated the effectiveness of the approach for different publicly available event logs and configuration settings.","Pika, Anastasiia; Wynn, Moe T.",Advanced Information Systems Engineering,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7266442/,587
35847,Zoeken naar het nieuwe normaal,2020-07-10,"Uniform interpolants were largely studied in non-classical propositional logics since the nineties, and their connection to model completeness was pointed out in the literature. A successive parallel research line inside the automated reasoning community investigated uniform quantifier-free interpolants (sometimes referred to as “covers”) in first-order theories. In this paper, we investigate cover transfer to theory combinations in the disjoint signatures case. We prove that, for convex theories, cover algorithms can be transferred to theory combinations under the same hypothesis needed to transfer quantifier-free interpolation (i.e., the equality interpolating property, aka strong amalgamation property). The key feature of our algorithm relies on the extensive usage of the Beth definability property for primitive fragments to convert implicitly defined variables into their explicitly defining terms. In the non-convex case, we show by a counterexample that cover may not exist in the combined theories, even in case combined quantifier-free interpolants do exist.","Calvanese, Diego; Ghilardi, Silvio; Gianola, Alessandro; Montali, Marco; Rivkin, Andrey",Automated Reasoning,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7324127/,587

41040,Profession,2020-10-20,"The social rules of a universal market economy, created by globalization, are based on the standards adopted by the ILO since 1919. Among them a special role belongs to fundamental principles and rights at work, comprised in an ILO Declaration in 1998. They provide for freedom of association, collective bargaining and the elimination of child and forced labour and discrimination. There is a growing debate on how other standards should be linked to fundamental rights and not seen as less important instruments. Technical cooperation has demonstrated that, in any case, implementing fundamental rights leads to strengthening of law and practice on wages, social security and occupational safety and health. All international labour standards (Conventions, Recommendations and Protocols) are derived from the labour principles of the ILO Constitution, and they are closely connected with one another. While the role of the state remains crucial—especially in times of crisis—much of the implementation of labour standards should be achieved through collective bargaining and other negotiations, while voluntary agreements between the social partners are generally legally binding.","Tapiola, Kari",International Labour Organization and Global Social Governance,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7562825/,587
43087,Profession,2020-12-11,"PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated drastic and rapid changes throughout the field of radiation oncology, some of which were unique to the discipline of radiosurgery. Available guidelines called for reduced frame use, postponing non-urgent cases, and reducing the number of fractions delivered. Our institution enacted many of these guidelines, and herein we show the resultant effect on patient treatments on our Gamma Knife Icon system. METHODS & MATERIALS: In early to mid-March of 2020 our institution rapidly implemented suggested changes according to ASTRO and other consensus guidelines as they relate specifically to stereotactic radiosurgery in the COVID-19 era. We reviewed the GK Icon schedule at our institution between January 01 and April 30, 2020. We documented age, condition treated, technique (frame vs. mask), and number of fractions. We then tabulated and graphed the number of patients, framed cases, and fractions across that time period. RESULTS: Seventy-seven patients were treated on the GK Icon between January and April 2020, for a total of 231 fractions. The number of unique patients per month varied from 18 (April) to 22 (January). Of the 77 patients only 5 were treated using a frame. The number of fractions per month decreased significantly over time, from 70 in January to 36 in April. Likewise, the percentage of single fraction cases increased from 4.5% per month in January to 67% in April. CONCLUSIONS: The results presented here show that it is possible to quickly and efficiently change work flows to allow for reduced fractionation and frame use in the time of a global pandemic. Multidisciplinary cooperation and ongoing communication are integral to the success of such programs.","Wegner, Rodney; Horne, Zachary; Xu, Linda; Yu, Alexander; Goss, Matthew; Liang, Yun; Sohn, Jason; Colonias, Athanasios; Fuhrer, Russell; Karlovits, Stephen",Neuro Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7650431/,587

In this conclusion, we reflect on the main insights provided by the different contributions gathered in this edited volume. Three different modalities of climate urbanism emerge across different chapters: ‘reactive,’ ‘entrepreneurial,’ and ‘transformative’ forms of climate urbanism. These different modalities coexist and, at times, contradict each other. Future research should foster new partnerships, methods and intellectual frameworks to support forms of climate urbanism that are just and that can overcome the exclusionary tendencies of current climate action in cities.","Castán Broto, Vanesa; Robin, Enora; While, Aidan",Climate Urbanism,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972060/,587

Humans have always been a mobile species, always on the go. But the advent of cheap energy coupled with our new transportation technologies let humans move farther, faster, and more often. As we described earlier, cheap modes of transportation have resulted in deleterious environmental impacts from energy extraction, pollution, and the infrastructures built to move people and stuff around. Transportation and its energies also have structured social relations in unequal ways. In the US, cheap energy helped facilitate suburban sprawl, leading to urban pollution when all these suburban cars were used each day in the city.","Mulvaney, Dustin",Sustainable Energy Transitions,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972061/,587

Many say we are witnessing a major energy transition to renewable energy, or maybe several energy transitions at the same time. It is not the first time. Energy transitions recur throughout human civilization. For much of human history, energy access, resource development, and the accompanying technological changes increased quality of life, albeit some more than others, for most of the human population. Putting biomass energy to use led to sedentary human communities, agriculture, metallurgy, and so on; it powered most of human history.

But a clear “Leave” majority was recorded, including in UK areas with substantial Japanese industrial investment. A Japanese Government paper in September 2016 argued for a withdrawal agreement that maintained frictionless UK/EU trade. Japan also views Brexit in terms of its strategic interests, reflecting the historical importance for Japan of the UK as an influential force in Europe. Japanese companies have made appropriate arrangements for a post-Brexit business environment, including moving or scaling down their operations in the UK. Both governments continue to work to maintain and strengthen the long-standing strategic relationship. A bilateral trade agreement is a priority. Both governments will want to build on the EU/Japan Economic Partnership Agreement of February 2019. Japan will presumably want to secure additional advantages from the UK that were impossible to obtain in Japan’s negotiations with the EU. Japan has also held out the possibility of the UK’s joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership.

54527,How to improve organizational performance during Coronavirus: A serial mediation analysis of organizational learning culture with knowledge creation,2021-05-14,"The documentation of archival workflows plays an important role in digital curation practice. Capturing the various steps, tools, people, and software involved at different stages, workflow documentation visually represents complex activities, and at times, invisible labor. In this article, we reflect on findings from the OSSArcFlow project, a three-year, grant-funded initiative to investigate and document workflow activities of 12 cultural heritage institutions using three open-source software systems. Building on previously published research on documentation of current digital curation practices, this article reflects on the challenges the project team encountered in modeling archivists’ aspirations for their workflows. While current practices could be accurately represented in linear process models, archivists’ aspirations for how they might advance digital curation practices extended beyond adding or changing discrete workflow steps and often involved sociotechnical factors that could not be easily mapped. This article presents a taxonomy of archivists’ aspirations for their born-digital archives, grouping these goals together around major themes that emerged throughout the research. Our findings show that workflow documentation is an essential artifact in helping archivists to understand gaps and challenges in their current workflows and to imagine the further development of digital curation tools, systems, and practices. Project participants especially benefited from engaging in this reflection on workflow documentation as part of a community of practitioners, with the opportunity to compare across institutional contexts.","Post, Colin; Chassanoff, Alexandra",Arch Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8202226/,587

65148,Pancreatic Cysts in the Elderly.,2019-11-09,OBJECTIVES To determine long-term adherence to a 5 day antibiotic course guideline for treating intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) infections. METHODS Descriptive analysis of patient-level data on all GNB-active antibiotics prescribed from day 3 and all GNB identified in clinical samples in 5350 patients admitted to a 30 bed general ICU between 2002 and 2009. RESULTS Four thousand five hundred and eleven of 5350 (84%) patients were treated with one or more antibiotics active against GNB commenced from day 3. Gentamicin was the most frequently prescribed antibiotic (92.2 days of therapy/1000 patient-days). Only 6% of courses spanned >6 days of therapy and 89% of antibiotic therapy days were with a single antibiotic active against GNB. There was no significant difference between gentamicin and meropenem in the number of first courses in which a resistant GNB was identified in blood cultures [11/1177 (0.9%) versus 5/351 (1.4%); P = 0.43] or respiratory tract specimens [59/951 (6.2%) versus 17/246 (6.9%); P = 0.68] at the time of starting therapy.

85216,[A new reality for the Mexican dermatology?],2021-02-02,"Coronaviruses are responsible for upper and lower respiratory tract infections in humans. It is estimated that 1 to 10% of the population suffers annually from cold-like symptoms related to infection with human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), an alphacoronavirus. The nucleocapsid (N) protein, the major structural component of the capsid, facilitates RNA packing, links the capsid to the envelope, and is also involved in multiple other processes, including viral replication and evasion of the immune system. Although the role of N protein in viral replication is relatively well described, no structural data are currently available regarding the N proteins of alphacoronaviruses. Moreover, our understanding of the mechanisms of RNA binding and nucleocapsid formation remains incomplete. In this study, we solved the crystal structures of the N- and C-terminal domains (NTD, residues 10 to 140, and CTD, residues 221 to 340, respectively) of the N protein of HCoV-NL63, both at a 1.5-Å resolution. Based on our structure of NTD solved here, we proposed and experimentally evaluated a model of RNA binding. The structure of the CTD reveals the mode of N protein dimerization. Overall, this study expands our understanding of the initial steps of N protein-nucleic acid interaction and may facilitate future efforts to control the associated infections.IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses are responsible for the common cold and other respiratory tract infections in humans. According to multiple studies, 1 to 10% of the population is infected each year with HCoV-NL63. Viruses are relatively simple organisms composed of a few proteins and the nucleic acids that carry the information determining their composition. The nucleocapsid (N) protein studied in this work protects the nucleic acid from the environmental factors during virus transmission. This study investigated the structural arrangement of N protein, explaining the first steps of its interaction with nucleic acid at the initial stages of virus structure assembly. The results expand our understanding of coronavirus physiology and may facilitate future efforts to control the associated infections.","Szelazek, Bozena; Kabala, Wojciech; Kus, Krzysztof; Zdzalik, Michal; Twarda-Clapa, Aleksandra; Golik, Przemyslaw; Burmistrz, Michal; Florek, Dominik; Wladyka, Benedykt; Pyrc, Krzysztof; Dubin, Grzegorz",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02503-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28331093/,587

Therefore, a systematic critical literature review was undertaken to assess the natural course of LBP in the general population from childhood through adolescence to young adulthood. Methods A systematic literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO with synonyms of search terms for 1) low back pain; 2) natural course; 3) cohort study and 4) children. Records in English, German, French, Danish, Swedish, and Norwegian were included. To assess the methodological quality of the studies, the NIH quality assessment checklist for cohort studies was adapted and risk of bias was assessed on a study level. Two authors independently reviewed selected studies, assessed quality, and extracted data. A synthesis of results in relation to the natural course of LBP was created. Results Totally, 3373 records were identified, eight articles were included for quality assessment, and finally, four studies of good to fair quality were included for synthesis of results. Indication of three common patterns of LBP were identified across studies and labelled as 1) ´children and adolescents with no LBP or low probability of LBP´ (49 to 53%), 2) ´children and adolescents with fluctuation of LBP´ (16 to 37%) and 3) ´children and adolescents with repeated reporting of LBP´ (< 1 to 10%). Conclusion Although methodological heterogeneity, mainly due to different age ranges, an indication of a natural course of LBP was seen across studies. The majority of children and adolescents repeatedly reporting no or low probability of LBP. With recall periods between one week to three months and sampling rates ranging from one to four years, a very low rate repeatedly reported LBP, and approximately one-fifth to one-third of children and adolescents had fluctuating reports of LBP. A need of future research of LBP trajectories with short reporting period lengths and narrower sampling windows in a long-term perspective is emphasized in order to study childhood influences on the development of LBP throughout life.","Junge, Tina; Wedderkopp, Niels; Boyle, Eleanor; Kjaer, Per",Chiropractic & manual therapies,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12998-018-0231-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30931103/,587

METHODS Patients receiving total arterial revascularization for three coronary territory disease were identified from two cardiac surgical databases (Sydney and Melbourne) using Society of Thoracic Surgeons-based definitions. BIMAY patients underwent surgery between 1994 and 2009, mostly using an age-limited protocol, while RAY patients underwent surgery between 1996 and 2003 without age limits. All-cause mortality was acquired from the national death registry and survival estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Propensity score matching was performed using 13 variables. Due to the age imbalance between groups, the primary comparison was performed for age ≤66 years. RESULTS Overall, 1,896 patients received RAY and 720 patients received BIMAY. Older age at surgery was the strongest independent predictor for mortality with a hazard ratio of HR 2.06, 95%CI 1.93, 2.22, P<0.001. After propensity score matching, we identified 299 pairs of patients ≤66 years with no preoperative or operative differences and similar age at surgery, RAY 56.4±7.0 vs. BIMAY 56.4±6.8 years, P=0.96. The RAY group had 4.0±0.9 grafts and the BIMAY group had 3.9±0.9, P=0.814. All-cause mortality was not different, with the proportion surviving at 15 years at 74.9% for RAY vs. 76.2% for BIMAY (P=0.211).

Therefore, cannabis use among individuals with depression may be becoming more prevalent. Objective To examine the association of depression with past-month cannabis use among US adults and the time trends for this association from 2005 to 2016. Design, Setting, and Participants This repeated cross-sectional study used data from 16 216 adults aged 20 to 59 years who were surveyed by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a national, annual, cross-sectional survey in the United States, between 2005 and 2016. Data analysis was conducted from January to February 2020. Exposures Survey year and depression, as indicated by a score of at least 10 on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Main Outcomes and Measures Any past-month cannabis use (ie, ≥1 use in the past 30 days) and daily or near-daily past-month cannabis use (ie, ≥20 uses in the past 30 days). Logistic regression was used to examine time trends in the prevalence of cannabis use, depression, and the association between cannabis use and depression from 2005 to 2016. Results The final analysis included 16 216 adults, of whom 7768 (weighted percentage, 48.9%) were men, 6809 (weighted percentage, 66.4%) were non-Hispanic White participants, and 9494 (weighted percentage, 65.6%) had at least some college education. They had a weighted mean age of 39.12 (95% CI, 38.23-39.40) years. Individuals with depression had 1.90 (95% CI, 1.62-2.24) times the odds of any past-month cannabis use and 2.29 (95% CI, 1.80-2.92) times the odds of daily or near-daily cannabis use compared with those without depression. The association between cannabis use and depression increased significantly from 2005 to 2016. The odds ratio for depression and any past-month cannabis use increased from 1.46 (95% CI, 1.07-1.99) in 2005 to 2006 to 2.30 (95% CI, 1.82-2.91) in 2015 to 2016. The odds ratio for depression and daily or near-daily past-month cannabis use increased from 1.37 (95% CI, 0.81-2.32) in 2005 to 2006 to 3.16 (95% CI, 2.23-4.48) in 2015 to 2016. Conclusions and Relevance The findings of this study indicate that individuals with depression are at increasing risk of cannabis use, with a particularly strong increase in daily or near-daily cannabis use. Clinicians should be aware of these trends and the evidence that cannabis does not treat depression effectively when discussing cannabis use with patients.","Gorfinkel, Lauren R; Stohl, Malki; Hasin, Deborah",JAMA network open,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.13802; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32809032/,587
185796,Detection of coronavirus-like particles from mink with epizootic catarrhal gastroenteritis.,1990,"Blended learning became unprecedentedly widespread due to the pandemic of COVID-19, especially in higher education. As a result, a lot of college students were beginners with this new technology-based learning method. The purpose of this study was to find out the key factors that impact beginners’ continuance intention in blended learning. The structural equation modeling was used to verify a model that integrates intrinsic goal orientation and academic self-efficacy into the Expectation-Confirmation Model of IS Continuance. A total of 342 college students who were the first time experiencing blended learning responded to the survey as beginners. The results showed that performance expectancy, intrinsic goal orientation, and satisfaction significantly impacted beginners’ continuance intention in blended learning. Meanwhile, performance expectancy, intrinsic goal orientation, and confirmation significant impacts on their continuance learning intention through mediating variable satisfaction. Academic self-efficacy didn’t directly impact college students’ continuance learning intention significantly, but it can indirectly impact continuance intention through intrinsic goal orientation. In the end, this study put forward several guidelines for educators of improving beginners’ blended learning experience to increase their continuance intention. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Yang, H.; Cai, J.; Yang, H.

187873,Molecular cloning of complementary DNA from a pneumopathic strain of bovine viral diarrhea virus and its diagnostic application.,1988,"Elucidation of the interaction of proteins with different molecules is of significance in the understanding of cellular processes. Computational methods have been developed for the prediction of protein-protein interactions. But insufficient attention has been paid to the prediction of protein-RNA interactions, which play central roles in regulating gene expression and certain RNA-mediated enzymatic processes. This work explored the use of a machine learning method, support vector machines (SVM), for the prediction of RNA-binding proteins directly from their primary sequence. Based on the knowledge of known RNA-binding and non-RNA-binding proteins, an SVM system was trained to recognize RNA-binding proteins. A total of 4011 RNA-binding and 9781 non-RNA-binding proteins was used to train and test the SVM classification system, and an independent set of 447 RNA-binding and 4881 non-RNA-binding proteins was used to evaluate the classification accuracy. Testing results using this independent evaluation set show a prediction accuracy of 94.1%, 79.3%, and 94.1% for rRNA-, mRNA-, and tRNA-binding proteins, and 98.7%, 96.5%, and 99.9% for non-rRNA-, non-mRNA-, and non-tRNA-binding proteins, respectively. The SVM classification system was further tested on a small class of snRNA-binding proteins with only 60 available sequences. The prediction accuracy is 40.0% and 99.9% for snRNA-binding and non-snRNA-binding proteins, indicating a need for a sufficient number of proteins to train SVM. The SVM classification systems trained in this work were added to our Web-based protein functional classification software SVMProt, at http://jing.cz3.nus.edu.sg/cgi-bin/svmprot.cgi. Our study suggests the potential of SVM as a useful tool for facilitating the prediction of protein-RNA interactions.","Han, Lian Yi; Cai, Cong Zhong; Lo, Siew Lin; Chung, Maxey C M; Chen, Yu Zong",RNA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14970381/,587

In the present study we describe a transgenic mouse model expressing eNOS fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP), which allows the study of localization and regulation of eNOS expression. We tested the functionality of eNOS in the eNOS-GFP mice. Expression of eNOS was restricted to the endothelial lining of blood vessels in various tissues tested, without appreciable expression in non-endothelial cells. Activity of the enzyme was confirmed by assaying the conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline. NO production in isolated vessels was increased in transgenic mice when compared to non-transgenic control animals (4.88 +/- 0.59 and 2.48 +/- 0.47 micro mol/L NO, respectively, P < 0.005). Both the mean aortic pressure and the pulmonary artery pressure were reduced in eNOS-GFP mice (both approximately 30%, P < 0.05). Plasma cholesterol levels were also slightly reduced ( approximately 20%, P < 0.05). In conclusion, eNOS-GFP mice express functional eNOS and provide a unique model to study regulation of eNOS activity or eNOS-mediated vascular events, including response to ischemia, response to differences in shear stress, angiogenesis and vasculogenesis, and to study the subcellular distribution in relation with functional responses to these events.","van Haperen, Rien; Cheng, Caroline; Mees, Barend M E; van Deel, Elza; de Waard, Monique; van Damme, Luc C A; van Gent, Teus; van Aken, Thijs; Krams, Rob; Duncker, Dirk J; de Crom, Rini",The American journal of pathology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14507674/,587

Safety at 72 h post-immunization was analyzed based on a self-reported form. Between January 5 and January 20, 2021, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, a total of 707 healthcare workers (median age 35 yrs, female 67%) were vaccinated. The response rate was 96.6% (n: 683) and 487 (71.3%) participants reported at least one ESAVI. The incidence rate was 6.3 per 1000 person/hours. The total number of ESAVIs was 1434. A total of 469 local reactions were reported, 57% of the participants reported pain at the injection site, and 11% had redness and swelling. A total of 968 systemic reactions were informed, including new or worsened muscle pain, referred by 58% of the participants, fever referred by 40%, and diarrhea referred by 5%. Five percent (n: 34) had serious adverse events and one participant had to be hospitalized.

197320,Passive protection of dogs against clinical disease due to Canine parvovirus-2 by specific antibody from chicken egg yolk.,2006,"We describe two novel sequence similarity search algorithms, FASTS and FASTF, that use multiple short peptide sequences to identify homologous sequences in protein or DNA databases. FASTS searches with peptide sequences of unknown order, as obtained by mass spectrometry-based sequencing, evaluating all possible arrangements of the peptides. FASTF searches with mixed peptide sequences, as generated by Edman sequencing of unseparated mixtures of peptides. FASTF deconvolutes the mixture, using a greedy heuristic that allows rapid identification of high scoring alignments while reducing the total number of explored alternatives. Both algorithms use the heuristic FASTA comparison strategy to accelerate the search but use alignment probability, rather than similarity score, as the criterion for alignment optimality. Statistical estimates are calculated using an empirical correction to a theoretical probability. These calculated estimates were accurate within a factor of 10 for FASTS and 1000 for FASTF on our test dataset. FASTS requires only 15-20 total residues in three or four peptides to robustly identify homologues sharing 50% or greater protein sequence identity. FASTF requires about 25% more sequence data than FASTS for equivalent sensitivity, but additional sequence data are usually available from mixed Edman experiments. Thus, both algorithms can identify homologues that diverged 100 to 500 million years ago, allowing proteomic identification from organisms whose genomes have not been sequenced.","Mackey, Aaron J; Haystead, Timothy A J; Pearson, William R",Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12096132/,587

Each group received either 6 mg thiafentanil (0.036 microg/kg (0.032-0.040 microg/kg) and 20 mg xylazine (TX) or 3.6 mg carfentanil (0.021 mg/kg [DOSAGE ERROR CORRECTED] (0.017-0.024 mg/kg) [DOSAGE ERROR CORRECTED] and 20 mg xylazine (CX). Once handled, physiologic measurements were taken every 5 min for 20 min. There were few physiologic differences between the groups, although TX gemsboks were more hypertensive. Quality of induction, quality of recovery, depth of anesthesia, and muscle relaxation were subjectively assessed. Although TX gemsboks showed a trend for more-rapid induction and recovery postantagonist administration, this difference was not statistically significant. Similarly, there was a trend for TX animals to have smoother inductions and improved immobilization quality, but only the quality of induction was significantly different. These trends suggest that TX is preferable to CX when anesthetizing adult gemsboks.","Kilgallon, Conor P; Lamberski, Nadine; Larsen, R Scott",Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20945664/,587

METHODS: Five hundred patients with myocardial infarction and 500 healthy controls were randomly selected. Fluorescent PCR and Sanger sequencing were used to detect the CYP2C19 and CYP3A5 gene polymorphisms. Logistic regression was used to analyze the correlation between the polymorphisms and myocardial infarction. Quanto software was used to evaluate the statistical power. RESULTS: The two groups had significant difference in the frequency of AG, GG genotypes and A allele of the CYP2C19 gene rs4986893 locus and the AA, AG, GG genotypes and G allele of the CYP3A5 gene rs776746 locus ( P<0.05), but not in the frequency of genotypes and alleles of CYP2C19 gene rs4244285 and rs12248560 loci, and the AA genotype of the rs4986893 locus. After correction for age, gender, and body mass index, Logistic regression indicated that the AG genotype and A allele of the CYP2C19 gene rs4986893 locus, and the GG genotype and G allele of CYP3A5 gene rs776746 locus are associated with susceptibility of myocardial infarction, while rs4986893 GG genotype and AA and AG genotypes of rs776746 may confer a protective effect. Based on the sample size and allele frequency, analysis with Quanto software suggested that the result of this study has a statistical power of 99%. CONCLUSION: CYP2C19 and CYP3A5 gene polymorphisms may increase the risk for myocardial infarction.","Qi, Lin; Liang, Wei; Qiao, Hui; Wang, Ruimin; Han, Jingxian; Xing, Xiaofei; Hu, Yuwei",Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi,,587

Digital PCR (dPCR) is capable of the absolute quantification of nucleic acids. METHOD: By using the droplet dPCR (QX200) and the digital real-time PCR (LOAA), the copy numbers were compared via multiple assays for three distinct targerts; EGFR DNA, SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1 RNA. RESULTS: The droplet dPCR and digital real-time PCR showed similar copy numbers for both DNA and RNA quantification. When the limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) of each method were estimated for DNA and RNA targets, the digital real-time PCR showed a higher sensitivity and precision especially with low copy number targets. CONCLUSION: The breath of nucleic acid testing in diagnostic applications continues to expand. In this study we applied common diagnostic targets to a novel digital real-time PCR methodology. It performed comparably to the established dPCR method with distinctive advantages and disadvantages for implementing in laboratories. These rapidly developing dPCR systems can be applied to benefit the accurate and sensitive nucleic acid testing for various clinical areas.","Lee, Sang-Soo; Park, Jae-Hyeong; Bae, Young-Kyung",Clin Chim Acta,,587

Adequate buildings and infrastructures made by the construction sector ensure that a country reaches certain targets like social development, industrialization, freight transportation, sustainable development, and urbanization. This study aims to determine the construction sector’s connectivity with other sectors through complex linkages that contribute immensely to the economy and gross domestic product (GDP). The data were collected from the Department of Statistics Malaysia and the World Bank from the year 1970 to 2019, and the Pearson correlation test, the cointegration test, and the Granger causality test were conducted. The vector error correction model (VECM) was created for short-term and long-term equilibrium analysis and impulse response function (IRF) was performed to study construction industry behavior. Afterwards, the forecasting was done for the year 2020 to 2050 of the Malaysian economy and GDP for the required sectors. It was revealed that some sectors, such as agriculture and services, have forward linkages while other sectors, such as manufacturing and mining, are independent of construction sector causality, which signifies the behavior of the contributing sectors when a recession occurs, hence generating significant revenue. The Malaysian economy is moving towards sustainable production with more emphasis on the construction sector. The outcome can be used as a benchmark by other countries to achieve sustainable development. The significance of this study is its usefulness for experts all over the world in terms of allocating resources to make the construction sector a sustainable sector after receiving a shock. A sustainable conceptual framework has been suggested for global application that shows the factors involved in the growth of the construction industry to ensure its sustainable development with time.","Wesam Salah, Alaloul Muhammad Ali Musarat Muhammad Babar Ali Rabbani Iqbal Qaiser Maqsoom Ahsen Farooq Waqas",Sustainability,,587

Contact tracing and quarantining of positive cases are chief strategies of disease control that has been accepted globally. Though scientific knowledge regarding household transmission of the COVID-19 through contact of positive case is sparse. Current systematic review was planned to assess global statistics and characteristics of household secondary attack rate (SAR) of COVID-19. Methods Eligible articles were retrieved through search of - MEDLINE, SCOPUS and EMBASE for the period December 2019 to June 15th 2020. Search terms were developed to identify articles reporting household SARs in various countries. After initial screening of 326 articles, 13 eligible studies were included in the final evidence synthesis. Results We found that SAR varies widely across countries with lowest reported rate as 4.6% and highest as 49.56%. The rates were unaffected by confounders such as population of the country, lockdown status and geographic location. Review suggested greater vulnerability of spouse and elderly population for secondary transmission than other household members. It was also observed that quarantining and isolation are most effective strategies for prevention of the secondary transmission of the disease. Symptomatic status of the index case emerged to be a critical factor, with very low transmission probability during asymptomatic phase. Conclusion Present review findings recommend that adequate measures should be provided to protect the vulnerable population as only case tracing and quarantining might be insufficient. It should be combined with advisory for limiting household contacts and active surveillance for symptom onset.","Shah, Komal; Saxena, Deepak; Mavalankar, Dileep",QJM,,587

We aimed to analyse the impact of medical support and population emigration from Wuhan on the cure rate and mortality of COVID-19 infection in China and to provide early warning on the developmental trend of the epidemic. METHODS: Data were obtained from The National Health Commission of People's Republic of China, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and The National Health Commission of People's Republic of Hubei Province. The Poisson distribution and normal approximate were used to analyse the relationship between population emigration from Wuhan and the probability of outbreaks and to predict the developmental trend of the epidemic situation. RESULTS: The outbreak were related to population emigration from Wuhan in 87% of the cities in Hubei. The result of developmental trend indicated that 95% confidence intervals of confirmed case in Xiaogan and HuangGang were 3301.678-3526.042 and 3201.189-3422.17, respectively. For province outside of Hubei, the outbreak in 76% of the provinces were related to population emigration from Wuhan. Hot spot provinces for epidemic prevention included GuangDong and HeNan. Medical support significantly improved the cure rate of patients with COVID-19 (r = 0.852, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Population emigration from Wuhan has a certain impact on the probability of outbreaks COVID-19 in Hubei and the whole country, medical support improved the cure rate of patients with COVID-19.","Yao, Yang; Tian, Yao; Zhou, Jing; Diao, Xin; Di, Ligai; Wang, Shengyu",Journal of epidemiology and global health (Online),,587

RPAS have been successfully used for surveillance, search and rescue, delivery, and equipping drones with telemedical capabilities being considered. However, we know of no previous consideration of RPAS-delivered tele-ultrasound capabilities. Of all imaging technologies, ultrasound is the most portable and capable of providing real-time point-of-care information regarding anatomy, physiology, and procedural guidance. Moreover, remotely guided ultrasound including self-performed has been a backbone of medical care on the International Space Station since construction. The TeleMentored Ultrasound Supported Medical Interventions Group of the University of Calgary partnered with the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology to demonstrate RPAS delivery of a smartphone-supported tele-ultrasound system by the SwissDrones SDO50 RPAS. Upon receipt of the sanitized probe, a completely ultrasound-naïve volunteer was guided by a remote expert located 100 km away using online video conferencing (Zoom), to conduct a self-performed lung ultrasound examination. It proved feasible for the volunteer to examine their anterior chest, sides, and lower back bilaterally, correlating with standard recommended examinations in trauma/critical care, including the critical locations of a detailed COVID-19 lung diagnosis/surveillance examination. We contend that drone-delivered telemedicine including a tele-ultrasound capability could be leveraged to enhance point-of-care diagnostic accuracy in catastrophic emergencies, and allow diagnostic capabilities to be delivered to vulnerable populations in remote locations for whom transport is impractical or undesirable, speeding response times, or obviating the risk of disease transmission depending on the circumstances.","Kirkpatrick, Andrew W; McKee, Jessica L; Moeini, Shabab; Conly, John M; Ma, Irene W Y; Baylis, Barry; Hawkins, Wade",J. digit. imaging,,587

DESIGN AND METHODS: We retrospectively collected data from COVID-19 patients diagnosed and cared for in Marseille, France. We selected data from patients who at admission, had a low dose CT scanner, dyspnea status, and oxygen saturation available. Blood gas was analyzed in a sample subset of patients. RESULTS: Among 1712 patients with COVID-19, we report that 1107 (64.7%) do not complain of shortness of breath at admission. The low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) scan showed signs compatible with pneumonia in 757/1,107 (68.4%) of patients without dyspnea. In a subset of patients who had underwent at least one blood gas analysis (n = 161) and presented without dyspnea at admission, 28.1% (27/96) presented with a hypoxemia/hypocapnia syndrome. Asymptomatic hypoxia was associated with a very poor outcome (33.3% were transferred to the ICU and 25.9% died). CONCLUSION: The absence of shortness of breath in an old patient with comorbidity merit medical attention and should not be considered as a good sign of well-being. The poor prognosis of asymptomatic hypoxia, highlight the severity of this mild clinical presentation. In these patients, pulse oximetry is an important mean to predict the outcome along with news score and LDCT scanner.","Brouqui, Philippe; Amrane, Sophie; Million, Matthieu; Cortaredona, Sébastien; Parola, Philippe; Lagier, Jean-Christophe; Raoult, Didier",Int J Infect Dis,,587
260908,Addressing the post Covid-19 economic consequences of lockdown in India,2021,"Therapeutic hypothermia was a mainstay of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) management for half a century. Recent trials have suggested that its effect on long-term functional outcome is neutral or negative, despite apparently promising pre-clinical data. Systematic review and meta-analysis is a useful tool to collate experimental data and investigate the basis of its conclusions. We searched three online databases to identify studies testing systemic hypothermia as monotherapy for treatment of animals subjected to a TBI. Data pertaining to TBI paradigm, animal subjects, and hypothermia management were extracted as well as those relating to risk of bias. We pooled outcome data where sufficient numbers allowed and investigated heterogeneity in neurobehavioral outcomes using multi-variate meta-regression. We identified 90 publications reporting 272 experiments testing hypothermia in animals subject to TBI. The subjects were mostly small animals, with well-established models predominating. Target temperature was comparable to clinical trial data but treatment was initiated very early. Study quality was low and there was some evidence of publication bias. Delay to treatment, comorbidity, and blinded outcome assessment appeared to predict neurobehavioral outcome on multi-variate meta-regression. Therapeutic hypothermia appears to be an efficacious treatment in experimental TBI, which differs from the clinical evidence. The pre-clinical literature showed limitations in quality and design and these both appeared to affect neurobehavioral experiment outcome. These should be acknowledged when designing and interpreting pre-clinical TBI studies in the future.","Hirst, Theodore C; Klasen, Max G; Rhodes, Jonathan K; Macleod, Malcolm R; Andrews, Peter J D",J Neurotrauma,,587

Our estimates suggest that Covid-19 will reduce TFP in the private sector by up to 5% in 2020 Q4, falling back to a 1% reduction in the medium term. Firms anticipate a large reduction in 'within-firm' productivity, primarily because measures to contain Covid-19 are expected to increase intermediate costs. The negative 'within-firm' effect is partially offset by a positive 'between-firm' effect as low productivity sectors, and the least productive firms among them, are disproportionately affected by Covid-19 and consequently make a smaller contribution to the economy. In the longer run, productivity growth is likely to be reduced by diminished R&D expenditure and diverted senior management time spent on dealing with the pandemic.","Bloom, N.; Bunn, P.; Mizen, P.; Smietanka, P.; Thwaites, G.",Working Paper Series National Bureau of Economic Research,,587

Understanding the spatio-temporal dynamics of hotspot events is of great importance to support policy decisions and prevent large-scale outbreaks. This paper presents a spatio-temporal Bayesian framework for early detection of COVID-19 hotspots (at the county level) in the United States. We assume both the observed number of cases and hotspots depend on a class of latent random variables, which encode the underlying spatio-temporal dynamics of the transmission of COVID-19. Such latent variables follow a zero-mean Gaussian process, whose covariance is specified by a non-stationary kernel function. The most salient feature of our kernel function is that deep neural networks are introduced to enhance the model's representative power while still enjoying the interpretability of the kernel. We derive a sparse model and fit the model using a variational learning strategy to circumvent the computational intractability for large data sets. Our model demonstrates better interpretability and superior hotspot-detection performance compared to other baseline methods.","Zhu, Shixiang; Bukharin, Alexander; Xie, Liyan; Yang, Shihao; Keskinocak, Pinar; Xie, Yao",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.00072v1.pdf,587

On December 18, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for Moderna COVID-19 vaccine administered as 2 doses, 1 month apart to prevent COVID-19. On December 19, 2020, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) issued an interim recommendation for use of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (1). As of January 10, 2021, a reported 4,041,396 first doses of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine had been administered in the United States, and reports of 1,266 (0.03%) adverse events after receipt of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine were submitted to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Among these, 108 case reports were identified for further review as possible cases of severe allergic reaction, including anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening allergic reaction that occurs rarely after vaccination, with onset typically within minutes to hours (2). Among these case reports, 10 cases were determined to be anaphylaxis (a rate of 2.5 anaphylaxis cases per million Moderna COVID-19 vaccine doses administered), including nine in persons with a documented history of allergies or allergic reactions, five of whom had a previous history of anaphylaxis. The median interval from vaccine receipt to symptom onset was 7.5 minutes (range = 1-45 minutes). Among eight persons with follow-up information available, all had recovered or been discharged home. Among the remaining case reports that were determined not to be anaphylaxis, 47 were assessed to be nonanaphylaxis allergic reactions, and 47 were considered nonallergic adverse events. For four case reports, investigators have been unable to obtain sufficient information to assess the likelihood of anaphylaxis. This report summarizes the clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of case reports of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis and nonanaphylaxis allergic reactions, after receipt of the first dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine during December 21, 2020-January 10, 2021, in the United States. CDC has issued updated interim clinical considerations for use of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines currently authorized in the United States (3) and interim considerations for preparing for the potential management of anaphylaxis (4).","Anonymous,",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,587

273280,SNARKs to the rescue: proof-of-contact in zero knowledge,2020-05-26,"Spatio-temporal forecasting is of great importance in a wide range of dynamical systems applications from atmospheric science, to recent COVID-19 spread modeling. These applications rely on accurate predictions of spatio-temporal structured data reflecting real-world phenomena. A stunning characteristic is that the dynamical system is not only driven by some physics laws but also impacted by the localized factor in spatial and temporal regions. One of the major challenges is to infer the underlying causes, which generate the perceived data stream and propagate the involved causal dynamics through the distributed observing units. Another challenge is that the success of machine learning based predictive models requires massive annotated data for model training. However, the acquisition of high-quality annotated data is objectively manual and tedious as it needs a considerable amount of human intervention, making it infeasible in fields that require high levels of expertise. To tackle these challenges, we advocate a spatio-temporal physics-coupled neural networks (ST-PCNN) model to learn the underlying physics of the dynamical system and further couple the learned physics to assist the learning of the recurring dynamics. To deal with data-acquisition constraints, an active learning mechanism with Kriging for actively acquiring the most informative data is proposed for ST-PCNN training in a partially observable environment. Our experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets exhibit that the proposed ST-PCNN with active learning converges to near optimal accuracy with substantially fewer instances.","Huang, Yu; Tang, Yufei; Zhu, Xingquan; Shi, Min; Ali, Ali Muhamed; Zhuang, Hanqi; Cherubin, Laurent",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.05385v1.pdf,587
275095,Using information technology on sport participation during pandemic (COVID-19),2021,"""Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)"", the novel coronavirus, is responsible for the ongoing worldwide pandemic. ""World Health Organization (WHO)"" assigned an ""International Classification of Diseases (ICD)"" code-""COVID-19""-as the name of the new disease. Coronaviruses are generally transferred by people and many diverse species of animals, including birds and mammals such as cattle, camels, cats, and bats. Infrequently, the coronavirus can be transferred from animals to humans, and then propagate among people, such as with ""Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV)"", ""Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV)"", and now with this new virus, namely ""SARS-CoV-2"", or human coronavirus. Its rapid spreading has sent billions of people into lockdown as health services struggle to cope up. The COVID-19 outbreak comes along with an exponential growth of new infections, as well as a growing death count. A major goal to limit the further exponential spreading is to slow down the transmission rate, which is denoted by a ""spread factor (f)"", and we proposed an algorithm in this study for analyzing the same. This paper addresses the potential of data science to assess the risk factors correlated with COVID-19, after analyzing existing datasets available in ""ourworldindata.org (Oxford University database)"", and newly simulated datasets, following the analysis of different univariate ""Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)"" models for forecasting new cases and resulting deaths. The result shows that vanilla, stacked, and bidirectional LSTM models outperformed multilayer LSTM models. Besides, we discuss the findings related to the statistical analysis on simulated datasets. For correlation analysis, we included features, such as external temperature, rainfall, sunshine, population, infected cases, death, country, population, area, and population density of the past three months - January, February, and March in 2020. For univariate timeseries forecasting using LSTM, we used datasets from 1 January 2020, to 22 April 2020.","Chatterjee, Ayan; Gerdes, Martin W; Martinez, Santiago G",,,587

Their awareness of the disease is crucial for their safety, and for the management of the epidemic by spreading supportive information in their communities. OBJECTIVES: To assess COVID-19 related knowledge, attitude, and preventive practices among Egyptian medical students. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study from the beginning of April to June 2020;439 undergraduate medical students (1st - 6th academic years) were assessed using an online questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of 33 questions including: five items regarding socio-demographic features, 23 items concerning COVID-19 related knowledge, two items regarding attitude, and three items related to preventive measures. RESULTS: We observed an acceptable level of knowledge (74.3%) among studied sample. Preclinical and female students were significantly more optimistic as 69.1% expected successful control of COVID-19, and 48.9% predicted that Egypt will win the fight against COVID-19. Majority of participants reported wearing a facemask in public places as a preventive measure (56.7%). CONCLUSION: Egyptian medical students had an acceptable level of knowledge, positive attitude, and good practices of preventive measures regarding COVID-19 virus. There is no significant difference in almost all items of knowledge, attitude and practices in relation to gender or academic grade.","Emara, H. E.; Alhindi, A. A.; Orebi, H. A.; Kabbash, I.

The aim of the study was to examine alcohol intake, sleep disorders, and depressive symptoms of HCPs during the pandemic in comparison with the pre-pandemic period. Another goal was to indicate risk factors for mental state deterioration and an increase in alcohol use. A cross-sectional survey study was conducted from 1 April to 15 May 2020. HCPs (n = 158) completed questionnaires that probed for symptoms during and prior to the pandemic, including the Beck depression inventory (BDI), Social Support Scale (MOS-SSS), Athens insomnia scale (AIS), and Alcohol Timeline Followback (TLFB) calendar of alcohol consumption. Gender, age, education, marital status, work situation, income, participants' and relatives' COVID-19 diagnosis as correlates were analyzed. Depressive symptoms and insomnia became more severe during the pandemic among HCPs, while social support increased. The increase in depressive symptoms was even higher among women (OR 2.78, 95% CI 1.05-7.36; p = 0.04) and was also positively correlated with work reduction (p = 0.02); the presence of sleep disorders was correlated with female gender. Alcohol consumption increased during the pandemic, and was correlated with both more time spent at work and income increase. HCPs involved in the treatment of COVID-19 need support and attention due to the excessive stress load during pandemics, resulting in depression, insomnia, and increased alcohol intake.","Klimkiewicz, Anna; Schmalenberg, Adrianna; Klimkiewicz, Jakub; Jasinska, Agata; Jasionowska, Joanna; Machura, Weronika; Wojnar, Marcin",,,587
281864,COVID and the economic importance of in-person K-12 schooling,2020,"We analyze the transport and deposition behavior of dilute microparticles in turbulent Rayleigh-B\'enard convection. Two-dimensional direct numerical simulations were carried out for the Rayleigh number ($Ra$) of $10^{8}$ and the Prandtl number ($Pr$) of 0.71 (corresponding to the working fluids of air). The Lagrangian point particle model was used to describe the motion of microparticles in the turbulence. Our results show that the suspended particles are homogeneously distributed in the turbulence for Stokes number ($St$) less than $10^{-3}$, and they tend to cluster into bands for $10^{-3} \lesssim St \lesssim 10^{-2}$. At even larger $St$, the microparticles will quickly sediment in the convection. We also calculate the mean-square displacement (MSD) of the particle's trajectories. At short time intervals, the MSD exhibits a ballistic regime, and it is isotropic in vertical and lateral directions; at longer time intervals, the MSD reflects a confined motion for the particles, and it is anisotropic in different directions. We further obtained a phase diagram of the particle deposition positions on the wall, and three deposition states depending on the particle's density and diameter were identified. An interesting finding is that the dispersed particles preferred to deposit on the vertical wall where the hot plumes arise, which is verified by tilting the cell and altering the rotation direction of the large-scale circulation.","Xu, Ao; Tao, Shi; Shi, Le; Xi, Heng-Dong",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.05679v1.pdf,587

The first and most draconian interventions have been implemented in Wuhan, China, and these countermeasures have been increasingly deployed by countries around the world. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine risk factors, including the use of social media, for probable anxiety and depression in the community and among health professionals in the epicenter, Wuhan, China. METHODS: We conducted an online survey via WeChat, the most widely used social media platform in China, which was administered to 1577 community-based adults and 214 health professionals in Wuhan. Probable anxiety and probable depression were assessed by the validated Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 (cutoff &#8805;3) and Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (cutoff &#8805;3), respectively. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to examine factors associated with probable anxiety and probable depression. RESULTS: Of the 1577 community-based adults, about one-fifth of respondents reported probable anxiety (n=376, 23.84%, 95% CI 21.8-26.0) and probable depression (n=303, 19.21%, 95% CI 17.3-21.2). Similarly, of the 214 health professionals, about one-fifth of surveyed health professionals reported probable anxiety (n=47, 22.0%, 95% CI 16.6-28.1) or probable depression (n=41, 19.2%, 95% CI 14.1-25.1). Around one-third of community-based adults and health professionals spent &#8805;2 hours daily on COVID-19 news via social media. Close contact with individuals with COVID-19 and spending &#8805;2 hours daily on COVID-19 news via social media were associated with probable anxiety and depression in community-based adults. Social support was associated with less probable anxiety and depression in both health professionals and community-based adults. CONCLUSIONS: The internet could be harnessed for telemedicine and restoring daily routines, yet caution is warranted toward spending excessive time searching for COVID-19 news on social media given the infodemic and emotional contagion through online social networks.

287864,Historical reflection on Taijin-kyofusho during COVID-19: a global phenomenon of social anxiety?,2021,"BACKGROUND: During the past two decades, three novel coronaviruses (CoVs) have emerged to cause international human epidemics with severe morbidity. CoVs have also emerged to cause severe epidemics in animals. A better understanding of the natural hosts and genetic diversity of CoVs are needed to help mitigate these threats. OBJECTIVE: To design and evaluate a molecular diagnostic tool for detection and identification of all currently recognized and potentially future emergent CoVs from the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily. STUDY DESIGN AND RESULTS: We designed a semi-nested, reverse transcription RT-PCR assay based upon 38 published genome sequences of human and animal CoVs. We evaluated this assay with 14 human and animal CoVs and 11 other non-CoV respiratory viruses. Through sequencing the assay's target amplicon, the assay correctly identified each of the CoVs; no cross-reactivity with 11 common respiratory viruses was observed. The limits of detection ranged from 4 to 4â¯×â¯102 copies/reaction, depending on the CoV species tested. To assess the assay's clinical performance, we tested a large panel of previously studied specimens: 192 human respiratory specimens from pneumonia patients, 5 clinical specimens from COVID-19 patients, 81 poultry oral secretion specimens, 109 pig slurry specimens, and 31 aerosol samples from a live bird market. The amplicons of all RT-PCR-positive samples were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Our assay performed well with all tested specimens across all sample types. CONCLUSIONS: This assay can be used for detection and identification of all previously recognized CoVs, including SARS-CoV-2, and potentially any emergent CoVs in the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily.","Xiu, Leshan; Binder, Raquel A; Alarja, Natalie A; Kochek, Kara; Coleman, Kristen K; Than, Son T; Bailey, Emily S; Bui, Vuong N; Toh, Teck-Hock; Erdman, Dean D; Gray, Gregory C",J Clin Virol,,587

The epidemiological and clinical course of COVID-19 patients has been reported, but there have been few analyses about the characteristics, predictive risk factors, and outcomes of critical patients. In this single-center retrospective case-control study, 90 adult inpatients hospitalized at Tongji Hospital (Wuhan, China) were included. Demographic, clinical, laboratory tests, and treatment data were obtained and compared between critical and non-critical patients. We found that compared with non-critical patients, the critical patients had higher SOFA score and qSOFA scores. Critical patients had lower lymphocyte and platelet count, elevated D-dimer, decreased fibrinogen, and elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and interleukin-6(IL-6). More critical patients received treatment including antibiotics, anticoagulation, corticosteroid, and oxygen therapy than non-critical ones. Multivariable regression showed higher qSOFA score and elevation of IL-6 were related to critical patients. Antibiotic usage and anticoagulation were associated with decreased in-hospital mortality. And critical grouping contributed greatly to in-hospital death. Critical COVID-19 patients have a more severe clinical course. qSOFA score and elevation of IL-6 are risk factors for critical condition. Non-critical grouping, positive antibiotic application, and anticoagulation may be beneficial for patient survival.","Tian, Ran; Wu, Wei; Wang, Chunyao; Pang, Haiyu; Zhang, Zhiyu; Xu, Haopeng; Luo, Qingfeng; Gao, Peng; Shi, Jihua; Li, Wenbin; Qian, Hao; Guo, Fan; Li, Taisheng; Liu, Zhengyin; Wang, Jinglan; Zhou, Xiang; Qin, Yan; Yan, Xiaowei; Zhang, Shuyang",Sci Rep,,587

298799,Sensitivity in Detection of Antibodies to Nucleocapsid and Spike Proteins of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 in Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiologic agent of the current, world-wide coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the SARS-CoV-2 host entry receptor for cellular inoculation and target organ injury. We reviewed ACE2 expression and the role of ACE2-angiotensin 1-7-Mas receptor axis activity in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) pathogenesis to identify potential COVID-19 influences on AAA disease pathogenesis. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was performed on PubMed, National Library of Medicine. Key words included COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, AAA, ACE2, ACE or angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor inhibitor, angiotensin 1-7, Mas receptor, age, gender, respiratory diseases, diabetes, and autoimmune diseases. Key publications on the epidemiology and pathogenesis of COVID-19 and AAAs were identified and reviewed. RESULTS: All vascular structural cells, including endothelial and smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and pericytes express ACE2. Cigarette smoking, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lupus, certain types of malignancies, and viral infection promote ACE2 expression and activity, with the magnitude of response varying by sex and age. Genetic deficiency of AT1 receptor, or pharmacologic ACE or AT1 inhibition also increases ACE2 and its catalytic product angiotensin 1-7. Genetic ablation or pharmacologic inhibition of ACE2 or Mas receptor augments, whereas ACE2 activation or angiotensin 1-7 treatment attenuates, progression of experimental AAAs. The potential influences of SARS-CoV-2 on AAA pathogenesis include augmented ACE-angiotensin II-AT1 receptor activity resulting from decreased reciprocal ACE2-angiotensin 1-7-Mas activation; increased production of proaneurysmal mediators stimulated by viral spike proteins in ACE2-negative myeloid cells or by ACE2-expressing vascular structural cells; augmented local or systemic cross-talk between viral targeted nonvascular, nonleukocytic ACE2-expressing cells via ligand recognition of their cognate leukocyte receptors; and hypoxemia and increased systemic inflammatory tone experienced during severe COVID-19 illness. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 may theoretically influence AAA disease through multiple SARS-CoV-2-induced mechanisms. Further investigation and clinical follow-up will be necessary to determine whether and to what extent the COVID-19 pandemic will influence the prevalence, progression, and lethality of AAA disease in the coming decade.","Xu, Baohui; Li, Gang; Guo, Jia; Ikezoe, Toru; Kasirajan, Karthikeshwar; Zhao, Sihai; Dalman, Ronald L",J. vasc. surg,,587

We have witnessed a drastic fall in the number of patients. The aim of study was to assess the extent to which the Indian orthopaedic practice has been affected by the pandemic. Methods: We conducted an online survey amongst currently practicing Indian orthopaedic surgeons. Those currently not in practice or under training or having left clinical practice before the onset of pandemic were excluded. A total of 533 orthopaedic surgeons took part in the study amongst which, complete responses were obtained from 407 individuals. Statistical analysis was done to see the association between demographic profile of study participants and various variables of orthopaedic practice. Results: There was drastic fall in all the parameters of orthopaedic practice. Over half of the practicing surgeons witnessed fall in out-patients over 90%. Most had stopped elective surgeries (64%) and even emergency ones (21%) altogether. More than 50% of doctors had their earnings reduced by > 75%. We found a statistically highly significant association of reduction in earnings with the sector, type of set-up and duration of practice. (p-value < 0.001). Conclusion: This study suggests that orthopaedic surgeons across all sectors in different kinds of set-ups have been affected in their out-patient and operative numbers. With regards to earnings, those working in private and running their own (individual) hospitals & clinics have been most severely affected while those in government sector and medical colleges have been affected the least.","Keshav, Kumar; Kumar, Amit; Sharma, Pulak; Baghel, Anurag; Mishra, Prabhaker; Huda, Najmul",Indian J Orthop,,587

Those industries transform agricultural raw materials into added-value products. The fruit and vegetable industry is the largest and fastest-growing segment of the world agricultural production market, which commercialize various products such as juices, jams, and dehydrated products, followed by the cereal industry products such as chocolate, beer, and vegetable oils are produced. Similarly, the root and tuber industry produces flours and starches essential for the daily diet due to their high carbohydrate content. However, the processing of these foods generates a large amount of waste several times improperly disposed of in landfills. Due to the increase in the world's population, the indiscriminate use of natural resources generates waste and food supply limitations due to the scarcity of resources, increasing hunger worldwide. The circular economy offers various tools for raising awareness for the recovery of waste, one of the best alternatives to mitigate the excessive consumption of raw materials and reduce waste. The loss and waste of food as a raw material offers bioactive compounds, enzymes, and nutrients that add value to the food cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. This paper systematically reviewed literature with different food loss and waste by-products as animal feed, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical products that strongly contribute to the paradigm shift to a circular economy.

METHODS: We used the Epilepsy Phenome/Genome Project (EPGP) dataset that consisted of 2,197 participants in 1,043 family units with &#8805;2 members having a common generalized (GE) or non-acquired focal epilepsy (NAFE). We identified participants with a history of traditionally defined SE (TSE) (seizures &#8805;30 minutes) and operationally defined SE (OSE) (seizures &#8805;10 minutes) by chart review. We assessed familial aggregation of TSE and OSE using &#967;2 analysis and generalized estimating equations (GEE). RESULTS: One hundred fifty-five (7%) participants in 1,043 families had &#8805;1 episode of TSE. Two hundred fifty (11%) had &#8805;1 episode of OSE. In a &#967;2 analysis, the number of family units with &#8805;2 members having TSE (odds ratio [OR] 4.79, 95% CI 2.56-8.97) or OSE (OR 4.23, 95% CI 2.67-6.70) was greater than expected by chance. In GEE models adjusting for sex, broad epilepsy class (GE or NAFE), age at onset, and duration of epilepsy, TSE in a proband predicted TSE in a first-degree relative (OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.24-6.22), and OSE in a proband predicted OSE in a first-degree relative (OR 2.91, 95% CI 1.65-5.15). The results remained significant in models addressing epilepsy severity by incorporating the number of antiseizure medications used or epilepsy surgery. CONCLUSIONS: TSE and OSE showed robust familial aggregation in a cohort of familial epilepsy independently of epilepsy severity or class, suggesting that genetic factors contribute to SE independently of the genetic cause of these epilepsies.","Weisenberg, Judith L Z; Fitzgerald, Robert T; Constantino, John N; Winawer, Melodie R; Thio, Liu Lin",Neurology,,587

Formulation of a polysaccharide-based spray, known for its mucoadhesive properties, is undertaken and it is characterized for its mechanical, spray distribution, and antiviral properties. The ability to engineer key mechanical characteristics such as dynamic yield stresses and high coverage is shown, through systematic understanding of the composite mixture containing both gellan and &#955;-carrageenan. Furthermore, the spray systems demonstrate highly potent capacities to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero cells, resulting in complete inhibition when either treating, the cells, or the virus, prior to challenging for infection. From this data, a mechanism for both prophylaxis and prevention is proposed; where entrapment within a polymeric coating sterically blocks virus uptake into the cells, inactivating the virus, and allowing clearance within the viscous medium. As such, a fully preventative spray is formulated, targeted at protecting the lining of the upper respiratory pathways against SARS-CoV-2.","Moakes, Richard J A; Davies, Scott P; Stamataki, Zania; Grover, Liam M",Adv Mater,,587
324083,Indonesian New Exporter (INE) as a training and development model micro small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in the field of handicrafts,2021,"BackgroundSince December 2020, three COVID-19 vaccines have been authorized in the United States (U.S.) and were proceeded by large immunization programs. The aim of this study was to characterize the U.S. post-marketing safety (PMS) profiles of these vaccines with an in-depth analysis of mortality data. MethodsThis was a retrospective database analysis study. Details of the U.S. PMS reports (15 December 2020 to 19 March 2021) of the three vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Janssen Ad26.COV2.S) were retrieved from the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). A descriptive analysis was conducted to characterize the reported adverse events (AEs). A comparative (Pfizer-BioNTech vs. Moderna) analysis of mortality was conducted. The mean count ratio of death between the two vaccines was estimated using a negative binomial regression model adjusting for the measured confounders. ResultsA total of 44,451 AE reports were retrieved (corresponding to 0.05% of the U.S. population who received at least one dose). The most commonly reported AEs were injection site reactions (30.4% of the reports), pain (reported in 26.7% of the reports), and headache (18.6% of the reports). Serious AEs were reported in only 14.6% of the reports with 4,108 hospitalizations. The total number of deaths was 1,919 with a mean count ratio of Moderna (n=997) vs. Pfizer-BioNTech (n=899) of 1.07 (95% confidence interval 0.86 to 1.33). ConclusionsThe vast majority of PMS AEs in the U.S. were non-serious, and the number of serious AEs is very low given the total number of vaccinated U.S. population.","Albalawi, Omar M; Alomran, Maha I; Alsagri, Ghada M; Althunian, Turki A; Alshammari, Thamir M",,,587

328303,The role of acupuncture in the treatment of chronic pain,2020,"Background: Hospitalists, comprised of nurse practitioners and physician assistants (collectively, advanced practice providers [APPs]) and physicians, have opportunities to counsel patients and reduce SARS-CoV-2 related coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine hesitancy. However, hospitalist perspectives on the COVID-19 vaccine and potential differences between APPs and physicians are unknown. Understanding hospitalist perspectives could help to address vaccine hesitancy among patients.Methods: We conducted an online survey of hospitalists at Mayo Clinic sites in Arizona, Florida, Minnesota, and Wisconsin from 14 December 2020 through 4 January 2021. We collected demographic information and assessed perspectives on the COVID-19 vaccine and, for comparison, on the influenza vaccine. Descriptive statistics were used to compare responses between APPs and physicians.Results: The overall response rate was 42.7% (n = 128/300) and comprised of 53.9% women (n = 69/128) and 41.4% APPs (n = 53/128). Most hospitalists reported receiving or planning to receive vaccination against COVID-19 (93.7%; n = 119/128) and influenza (97.7%; n = 125/128). Most hospitalists reported they would advise 100% of patients to receive the COVID-19 vaccine (66% for APPs; 74.7% for physicians) and influenza vaccine (83% for APPs; 80% for physicians). Barriers to recommending the COVID-19 vaccine included patient health status and vaccine safety profile. Hospitalists reported that patients and coworkers receiving the COVID-19 vaccine would reduce their anxiety (~80% of hospitalists), social isolation (~64% of hospitalists), and improve their emotional support (~40% of hospitalists). APP and physician responses were similar. The possible reduction in social isolation was associated with higher odds of hospitalists advising all patients to receive the COVID-19 vaccine (adjusted odds ratio 2.95 [95% confidence interval, 1.32-6.59]; P< .008), whereas hospitalist age, gender, and profession showed no association.Conclusion: Most hospitalists would reportedly advise patients to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Barriers to this recommendation included patient health status and vaccine safety. Hospitalists are an important resource to provide patient education and reduce COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy.","Dugani, Sagar B; Geyer, Holly L; Maniaci, Michael J; Fischer, Karen M; Croghan, Ivana T; Coons, Trevor J; Canan, Elizabeth L; Burton, M Caroline",Hosp Pract (1995),,587

Against the background of the new coronavirus pneumonia, through the analysis and research of the current situation of domestic and foreign e-commerce logistics, optimize the cross-border e-commerce logistics distribution model, establish an environmental model, and use efficient search algorithms to search for walking paths that meet environmental requirements. Based on the Dijkstra algorithm model of demand, and based on the linear relationship between demand and delivery distance, an optimal route selection model is established to select the optimal route with the shortest total travel distance. The simulation results show that the cross-border e-commerce transportation time of this model is within 13 h, which is shorter than that of the traditional model. The search efficiency of the optimal route for cross-border e-commerce transportation is higher, and the time for cross-border e-commerce transportation is shorter.","Abudureheman, Abuduaini; Nilupaer, Aishanjiang",Soft comput,,587

The implementation of social distancing practices to combat the virus spread, however, has led to a notable improvement in air quality. This study compared the surface air quality monitoring data from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA)’s AirNow network during the period 20 March–5 May in 2020 to those in 2015–2019 from the Air Quality System (AQS) network over the state of California. The results indicated changes in fine particulate matter (PM₂.₅) of −2.04 ± 1.57 μg m⁻³ and ozone of −3.07 ± 2.86 ppb. If the air quality improvements persist over a year, it could potentially lead to 3970–8900 prevented premature deaths annually (note: the estimates of prevented premature deaths have large uncertainties). Public transit demand showed dramatic declines (~80%). The pandemic provides an opportunity to exhibit how substantially human behavior could impact on air quality. To address both the pandemic and climate change issues, better strategies are needed to affect behavior, such as ensuring safer shared mobility, the higher adoption of telecommuting, automation in the freight sector, and cleaner energy transition.","Pan, Shuai Gao H.

339035,Designing application of food safety standard implementation for street vendors in Indonesia in the context of anticipating COVID-19,2021,"Acute viral respiratory infections are the main infectious disease in the world. In 2020, a new disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), became a global pandemic. The immune response to the virus depends on factors such as genetics, age and physical state, and its main input receptor is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. The practice of physical exercises acts as a modulator of the immune system. During and after physical exercise, pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines are released, lymphocyte circulation increases, as well as cell recruitment. Such practice has an effect on the lower incidence, intensity of symptoms and mortality in viral infections observed in people who practice physical activity regularly, and its correct execution must be considered to avoid damage. The initial response is given mainly by type I interferons (IFN-I), which drive the action macrophages and lymphocytes, followed by lymphocyte action. A suppression of the IFN-I response has been noted in COVID-19. Severe conditions have been associated with storms of pro-inflammatory cytokines and lymphopenia, as well as circulatory changes and virus dispersion to other organs. The practice of physical activities strengthens the immune system, suggesting a benefit in the response to viral communicable diseases. Thus, regular practice of adequate intensity is suggested as an auxiliary tool in strengthening and preparing the immune system for COVID-19. Further studies are needed to associate physical exercise with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","da Silveira, Matheus Pelinski; da Silva Fagundes, Kimberly Kamila; Bizuti, Matheus Ribeiro; Starck, Édina; Rossi, Renata Calciolari; de Resende E Silva, Débora Tavares",Clin. exp. med,,587

348108,Education in Ukraine and Covid-19: New perspectives and opportunities,2021,"Robots in our daily surroundings are increasing day by day. Their usability and acceptability largely depend on their explicit and implicit interaction capability with fellow human beings. As a result, social behavior is one of the most sought-after qualities that a robot can possess. However, there is no specific aspect and/or feature that defines socially acceptable behavior and it largely depends on the situation, application, and society. In this article, we investigate one such social behavior for collocated robots. Imagine a group of people is interacting with each other and we want to join the group. We as human beings do it in a socially acceptable manner, i.e., within the group, we do position ourselves in such a way that we can participate in the group activity without disturbing/obstructing anybody. To possess such a quality, first, a robot needs to determine the formation of the group and then determine a position for itself, which we humans do implicitly. The theory of f-formation can be utilized for this purpose. As the types of formations can be very diverse, detecting the social groups is not a trivial task. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey of the existing work on social interaction and group detection using f-formation for robotics and other applications. We also put forward a novel holistic survey framework combining all the possible concerns and modules relevant to this problem. We define taxonomies based on methods, camera views, datasets, detection capabilities and scale, evaluation approaches, and application areas. We discuss certain open challenges and limitations in current literature along with possible future research directions based on this framework. In particular, we discuss the existing methods/techniques and their relative merits and demerits, applications, and provide a set of unsolved but relevant problems in this domain.","Barua, Hrishav Bakul; Mg, Theint Haythi; Pramanick, Pradip; Sarkar, Chayan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.06181v2.pdf,587

Thus, we performed a meta-analysis of published liver manifestations and described the liver damage in patients with COVID-19 who died or discharged alive. Approach & Results: We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, medRxiv, bioRxiv, the Cochrane Library, Embase, and three Chinese electronic databases through April 22, 2020. We analyzed pooled data on liver chemistries stratified by the main clinical outcome of COVID-19, using a fixed or random-effects model. In our meta-analysis of 19 studies, which included a total of 4,103 patients, the pooled mean alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels were respectively 31.7 and 51.0 IU/L in the patients with COVID-19 who died and 27.7 and 32.9 IU/L in those discharged alive (both p < 0.0001). Compared with the patients discharged alive, those who died tended to have lower albumin levels but longer prothrombin time and higher international standardized ratio. Conclusions: In this meta-analysis, according to the main clinical outcome of COVID-19, we comprehensively described three patterns of liver impairment related to COVID-19, hepatocellular injury, cholestasis, and hepatocellular disfunction. The patients who died from COVID-19 tended to have different liver chemistries from those discharged alive. Special caution should be given to the patients with relatively higher index of liver chemistries.","Xing, Qing-Qing; Dong, Xuan; Ren, Yan-Dan; Chen, Wei-Ming; Zeng, Dan-Yi; Cai, Yan-Yan; Hong, Mei-Zhu; Pan, Jin-Shui",,,587

A scoping review has the objective to review the information available in pregnant women infected with the MERS-CoV, SARSCoV, SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses to assess the similarities in terms of and differences in the clinical characteristics of the mothers and neonatal outcomes. METHODS: We carried out a bibliographic search (scoping review) according to the PRISMA guidelines between March and April 2020 in the MEDLINE, SciELO, and CUIDEN databases and the Elsevier COVID-19 Information Center. RESULTS: We analyzed 20 articles with a total of 102 cases. 9 of MERS-CoV, 14 of SARS-CoV and 79 of SARS-CoV-2. Fever (75.5%) and pneumonia (73.5%) were the most frequent symptoms in infected pregnant women. The most frequent obstetric complications were the threat of premature delivery (23.5%) and caesarean section (74.5%). No vertical transmission was documented in any of the infants. CONCLUSIONS: All three coronaviruses produce pneumonia with very similar symptoms, being milder in the case of SARSCoV2. Despite documented obstetric complications, neonatal outcomes are mostly favorable. Increased knowledge is needed to improve and prevent obstetric and neonatal complications from these infections in pregnant women.","Rodríguez-Blanco, N; Vegara-Lopez, I; Aleo-Giner, L; Tuells, J",Rev Esp Quimioter,,587

METHODS: A survey was disseminated to DBP clinicians through contact with international professional organizations to determine the use of telehealth in DBP care, before and since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Descriptive statistics and &#967;2 tests were used for analysis. RESULTS: A total of 271 respondents from 38 countries completed the survey. The number of respondents offering telehealth increased from 36% to 88% after the pandemic, with the greatest shift to telehealth among high-income countries (HICs). Among respondents using telehealth, 75.1% were conducting interactive video visits, with HICs using more telehealth modalities embedded in electronic health records. Most patients (98.7%) were at home for the telehealth encounter. Almost half (46.5%) could not include an interpreter in telehealth visits. Barriers reported by telehealth users included concerns about limited patient access to technology (74.3%), home environment distractions (56.5%), preference for in-person care (53.6%), telehealth effectiveness (48.1%), workflow efficiency (42.2%), and cost/reimbursement (32.1%). CONCLUSION: Global DBP clinicians rapidly adopted telehealth and continued to have interprofessional practice while doing so, with the largest adoption occurring in HICs. Provider concerns about effectiveness and patient access to technology emerged as key organizational and patient barriers, respectively. Increased provider confidence in telehealth and its sustained use in the future depends on supportive regulatory policies and availability and use of measures to monitor quality and effectiveness.","Srinivasan, Roopa; Wallis, Kate E; Soares, Neelkamal",J. dev. behav. pediatr,,587

The reopening of America and restarting of interventional techniques and elective surgical procedures has started. Unfortunately, with resurgence in some states, restrictions are once again being imposed. In addition, even during the Phase II and III of reopening, chronic pain patients and interventional pain physicians have faced difficulties because of the priority selection of elective surgical procedures.Chronic pain patients require high intensity care, specifically during a pandemic such as COVID-19. Consequently, it has become necessary to provide guidance for triaging interventional pain procedures, or related elective surgery restrictions during a pandemic. OBJECTIVES: The aim of these guidelines is to provide education and guidance for physicians, healthcare administrators, the public and patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our goal is to restore the opportunity to receive appropriate care for our patients who may benefit from interventional techniques. METHODS: The American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) has created the COVID-19 Task Force in order to provide guidance for triaging interventional pain procedures or related elective surgery restrictions to provide appropriate access to interventional pain management (IPM) procedures in par with other elective surgical procedures. In developing the guidance, trustworthy standards and appropriate disclosures of conflicts of interest were applied with a section of a panel of experts from various regions, specialties, types of practices (private practice, community hospital and academic institutes) and groups. The literature pertaining to all aspects of COVID-19, specifically related to epidemiology, risk factors, complications, morbidity and mortality, and literature related to risk mitigation and stratification was reviewed. The evidence -- informed with the incorporation of the best available research and practice knowledge was utilized, instead of a simplified evidence-based approach. Consequently, these guidelines are considered evidence-informed with the incorporation of the best available research and practice knowledge. RESULTS: The Task Force defined the medical urgency of a case and developed an IPM acuity scale for elective IPM procedures with 3 tiers. These included urgent, emergency, and elective procedures. Examples of urgent and emergency procedures included new onset or exacerbation of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), acute trauma or acute exacerbation of degenerative or neurological disease resulting in impaired mobility and inability to perform activities of daily living. Examples include painful rib fractures affecting oxygenation and post-dural puncture headaches limiting the ability to sit upright, stand and walk. In addition, emergency procedures include procedures to treat any severe or debilitating disease that prevents the patient from carrying out activities of daily living. Elective procedures were considered as any condition that is stable and can be safely managed with alternatives. LIMITATIONS: COVID-19 continues to be an ongoing pandemic. When these recommendations were developed, different stages of reopening based on geographical regulations were in process. The pandemic continues to be dynamic creating every changing evidence-based guidance. Consequently, we provided evidence-informed guidance. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has created unprecedented challenges in IPM creating needless suffering for pain patients. Many IPM procedures cannot be indefinitely postponed without adverse consequences. Chronic pain exacerbations are associated with marked functional declines and risks with alternative treatment modalities. They must be treated with the concern that they deserve.

368939,Data analysis and mapping for monitoring health risk What has the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic in northern Italy taught us?,2020,"The Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is a well-known vaccine with almost a century of use, with the apparent capability to improve cytokine production and epigenetics changes that could develop a better response to pathogens. It has been postulated that BCG protection against SARS-CoV-2 has a potential role in the pandemic, through the presence of homologous amino acid sequences. To identify a possible link between BCG vaccination coverage and COVID-19 cases, we used official epidemic data and Ecuadorian Ministry of Health and Pan American Health Organization vaccination information. BCG information before 1979 was available only at a national level. Therefore, projections based on the last 20 years were performed, to compare by specific geographic units. We used a Mann-Kendall test to identify BCG coverage variations, and mapping was conducted with a free geographic information system (QGIS). Nine provinces where BCG vaccine coverage was lower than 74.25% show a significant statistical association (&#967;2 Pearson's = 4.800, df = 1, p = 0.028), with a higher prevalence of cases for people aged 50 to 64 years than in younger people aged 20 to 49 years. Despite the availability of BCG vaccination data and the mathematical models needed to compare these data with COVID-19 cases, our results show that, in geographic areas where BCG coverage was low, 50% presented a high prevalence of COVID-19 cases that were young; thus, low-coverage years were more affected.","Garzon-Chavez, Daniel; Rivas-Condo, Jackson; Echeverria, Adriana; Mozo, Jhoanna; Quentin, Emmanuelle; Reyes, Jorge; Teran, Enrique",,,587

This study aims to determine the clinical importance of platelet count and platelet indices in the differentiation of COVID-19 from influenza and the value of these parameters in the differential diagnosis of COVID-19. The medical records of the patients and the electronic patient monitoring system were retrospectively analyzed. Demographic characteristics, admission symptoms, laboratory findings, radiological involvement, comorbidities, and mortality of the patients were recorded. Forty-three patients diagnosed with influenza and 54 diagnosed with COVID-19 were included in the study. The average age of the COVID-19 patients was lower than that of the influenza patients (influenza: 60.5 years, COVID-19: 52.4 years; pp = 0.024),.024), and the male gender was predominant in the COVID-19 group (influenza: 42%, COVID-19: 56%). According to laboratory findings, the mean platelet volume (MPV) and MPV/platelet ratio were statistically significantly lower, whereas the eosinophil count and platelet distribution width levels were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the COVID-19 group. It was found that the most common symptom in both groups was dyspnea and that the symptom was more prevalent among influenza patients. In the diagnosis of COVID-19, the platelet count and platelet indices are easily accessible, inexpensive, and important parameters in terms of differential diagnosis and can help in the differentiation of COVID-19 from influenza during seasonal outbreaks of the latter.","Ozcelik, Neslihan; Ozyurt, Songul; Yilmaz Kara, Bilge; Gumus, Aziz; Sahin, Unal",J Med Virol,,587

The objective of this study was to compare concerns about COVID-19 among individuals undergoing cancer treatment to those with a history of cancer not currently receiving therapy and to those without a cancer history. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional anonymous online survey study of adults currently residing in the United States. Participants were recruited over a one-week period (April 3-11, 2020) using promoted advertisements on Facebook and Twitter. Groups were compared using chi-squared tests, Fisher's exact tests, and t-tests. RESULTS: 543 respondents from 47 states provided information on their cancer history and were included in analyses. Participants receiving active treatment reported greater concern about infection from the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus (p<0.001), higher levels of family distress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic (p = 0.004), and greater concern that the general public does not adequately understand the seriousness of COVID-19 (p = 0.04). Those with metastatic disease were more likely to indicate that COVID-19 had negatively affected their cancer care compared to patients with non-metastatic cancer (50.8% vs. 31.0%; p = 0.02). The most commonly reported treatment modifications included chemotherapy delays. CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing active treatment for cancer were most concerned about the short-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the logistics as well as potential efficacy of ongoing cancer treatment, longer term effects, and overarching societal concerns that the population at large is not as concerned about the public health implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Lou, Emil; Teoh, Deanna; Brown, Katherine; Blaes, Anne; Holtan, Shernan G; Jewett, Patricia; Parsons, Helen; Mburu, E Waruiru; Thomaier, Lauren; Hui, Jane Yuet Ching; Nelson, Heather H; Vogel, Rachel I",PLoS One,,587

In absence of any effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19), remdesivir has been tried for a compassionate use in severe COVID-19. Newer randomized controlled studies that have recently become available, showed a mixed result. We aimed to systematically search the literature to understand the pharmacology and clinical effects of remdesivir in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We systematically searched the PubMed, ClinicalTrial.Org and MedRxiv database up till May 5, 2020 using specific key words such as ""Remdesivir"" or 'GS-5734â³ AND ""COVID-19"" or ""SARS-CoV-2"" and retrieved all the article published in English language, that have reported the pharmacology and the clinical outcomes of remdesivir in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: Initial compassionate use of remdesivir has shown a fairly good result, but difficult to quantify, in the absence of control arm. While the very first double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial conducted in Wuhan, did not find any significant benefit compared to the control, the preliminary result of another similar multi-country trial has shown a significant faster time to recovery but without any difference in mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Remdesivir has shown a mixed result in patients with COVID-19 with an acceptable side effect. However, jury is still out while awaiting the results from the forthcoming trials.","Singh, Awadhesh Kumar; Singh, Akriti; Singh, Ritu; Misra, Anoop",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,587

During the COVID-19 pandemic, concerns about the mental health and psychosocial problems among health care workers and the general population are now arising. Yet, information on mental health and psychosocial problems among health care workers and the general population have not been comprehensively reported in Thailand. As such, we conduct a cross-sectional study, a national online survey to describe the short- and long-term consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and psychosocial problems among health care workers and the general population in Thailand. METHODS: This study is a repeated cross-sectional study, an open online voluntary national-based survey during the wave I (April 21-May 4, 2020) follow-up in the wave II (August 3-16, 2020), wave III (November 15-28, 2020), and a 1-year follow-up survey (wave IV: April 21-May 4, 2021) in Thailand. Health care workers at the hospitals and the adult general population will be invited to participate in the online survey via the SurveyMonkey that limits one-time participation per unique internet protocol address. The target sample size of at least 1182 health care workers and 1310 general populations will be required to complete the online survey for each wave of the survey. Sociodemographic characteristics and a set of measurement tools for mental and psychosocial problems for each subcohort including depression, anxiety, stress, resilient copings, neuroticism, perceived social support, wellbeing, somatic symptoms, insomnia, burnout (for healthcare workers), and public stigma toward COVID-19 infection (for the general population) will be collected. For all estimates of prevalence, we will weigh data for all wave analyses under the complex design of the survey. Subgroup analyses stratified by key characteristics will also be done to analyze the proportion differences. For the repeated cross-sectional survey, we will combine the data from the wave I to wave IV survey to analyze changes in the mental health status. We will perform multilevel logistic regression models with random intercepts to explore associations with individual-level and region-level/hospital-level predictors. We also plan to perform an ancillary systematic review and meta-analysis by incorporating data from our findings to all available evidence. RESULTS: Our findings will provide information on the short- and long-term mental health status as well as the psychosocial responses to the COVID-19 outbreak in a national sample of health care workers and the general population in Thailand. CONCLUSION: This prospective, nationally based, a repeated cross-sectional study will describe the mental health status and psychosocial problems among health care workers and the general population in Thailand during the COVID-19 pandemic. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the Faculty of Public Health and Faculty of Pharmacy, Chiang Mai University.

According to the latest report (18-February-2020), it has infected more than 72,000 people globally and led to deaths of more than 1,016 people in China. Methods: The 2019 novel coronavirus proteome was aligned to a curated database of viral immunogenic peptides. The immunogenicity of detected peptides and their binding potential to HLA alleles was predicted by immunogenicity predictive models and NetMHCpan 4.0. Results: We report in silico identification of a comprehensive list of immunogenic peptides that can be used as potential targets for 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) vaccine development. First, we found 28 nCoV peptides identical to Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS CoV) that have previously been characterized immunogenic by T cell assays. Second, we identified 48 nCoV peptides having a high degree of similarity with immunogenic peptides deposited in The Immune Epitope Database (IEDB). Lastly, we conducted a de novo search of 2019-nCoV 9-mer peptides that i) bind to common HLA alleles in Chinese and European population and ii) have T Cell Receptor (TCR) recognition potential by positional weight matrices and a recently developed immunogenicity algorithm, iPred, and identified in total 63 peptides with a high immunogenicity potential. Conclusions: Given the limited time and resources to develop vaccine and treatments for 2019-nCoV, our work provides a shortlist of candidates for experimental validation and thus can accelerate development pipeline.","Lee, Chloe H; Koohy, Hashem",F1000Res,,587

Mastoidectomy is a high-risk aerosol generating procedure with the potential to expose the surgeon to infectious particles. Objective Aim to develop a low-cost prototype for a barrier device that can be used during mastoidectomy. Methods Describe the steps involved during otological emergency, requiring immediate surgical procedure, in untested patients. The Otorhinolaryngology Surgical Team of Walter Cantidio Hospital developed the barrier for particle dispersion presented here. Results During surgery, the prototype did not compromise visualization of the surgical field and instrumentation. Microscope repositioning was not compromised or limited by tent Instrumentation and instrument pouch under the Microscope-Tent (MT) performed surgery. After surgery, the plastic sheet was removed simply, without requiring strength. Bone dust and irrigation droplets were collected on the tent. Conclusion Our team developed and practiced, in an otologic emergency, a low-cost and reproducible barrier device that can be used in mastoidectomy in COVID-19 patients. Further tests on efficacy may be necessary.","Muniz, C. R.; Pena, C. F. O.; da Fonseca, M. R. S.; de Freitas, M. R.",International @rchives of Otorhinolaryngology,,587

410682,"Machine Learning Approach to Detect Fake News, Misinformation in COVID-19 Pandemic",2021,"We use high-frequency Google search data, combined with data on the announcement dates of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) during the COVID-19 pandemic in U.S. states, to disentangle the short-run direct impacts of multiple different state-level NPIs in an event study framework. Exploiting differential timing in the announcements of restaurant and bar limitations, non-essential business closures, stay-at-home orders, large-gatherings bans, school closures, and emergency declarations, we leverage the high-frequency search data to separately identify the effects of multiple NPIs that were introduced around the same time. We then describe a set of assumptions under which proxy outcomes can be used to estimate a causal parameter of interest when data on the outcome of interest are limited. Using this method, we quantify the share of overall growth in unemployment during the COVID-19 pandemic that was directly due to each of these state-level NPIs. We find that between March 14 and 28, restaurant and bar limitations and non-essential business closures can explain 6.0% and 6.4% of UI claims respectively, while the other NPIs did not directly increase own-state UI claims. This suggests that most of the short-run increase in UI claims during the pandemic was likely due to other factors, including declines in consumer demand, local policies, and policies implemented by private firms and institutions.","Kong, Edward; Prinz, Daniel",J.

413130,Indonesian Course in Covid-19 Pandemic Period with A Line Application System,2021,"BACKGROUND: The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019 and its subsequent spread worldwide continues to be a global health crisis. Many governments consider contact tracing of citizens through apps installed on mobile phones as a key mechanism to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we sought to explore the suitability of artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled social media analyses using Facebook and Twitter to understand public perceptions of COVID-19 contact tracing apps in the United Kingdom. METHODS: We extracted and analyzed over 10,000 relevant social media posts across an 8-month period, from March 1 to October 31, 2020. We used an initial filter with COVID-19-related keywords, which were predefined as part of an open Twitter-based COVID-19 dataset. We then applied a second filter using contract tracing app-related keywords and a geographical filter. We developed and utilized a hybrid, rule-based ensemble model, combining state-of-the-art lexicon rule-based and deep learning-based approaches. RESULTS: Overall, we observed 76% positive and 12% negative sentiments, with the majority of negative sentiments reported in the North of England. These sentiments varied over time, likely influenced by ongoing public debates around implementing app-based contact tracing by using a centralized model where data would be shared with the health service, compared with decentralized contact-tracing technology. CONCLUSIONS: Variations in sentiments corroborate with ongoing debates surrounding the information governance of health-related information. AI-enabled social media analysis of public attitudes in health care can help facilitate the implementation of effective public health campaigns.","Cresswell, Kathrin; Tahir, Ahsen; Sheikh, Zakariya; Hussain, Zain; Domínguez Hernández, Andrés; Harrison, Ewen; Williams, Robin; Sheikh, Aziz; Hussain, Amir",J Med Internet Res,,587

414898,Maternal medicine in the COVID era,2021,"The household secondary attack risk (SAR), often called the secondary attack rate or secondary infection risk, is the probability of infectious contact from an infectious household member A to a given household member B, where we define infectious contact to be a contact sufficient to infect B if he or she is susceptible. Estimation of the SAR is an important part of understanding and controlling the transmission of infectious diseases. In practice, it is most often estimated using binomial models such as logistic regression, which implicitly attribute all secondary infections in a household to the primary case. In the simplest case, the number of secondary infections in a household with m susceptibles and a single primary case is modeled as a binomial(m, p) random variable where p is the SAR. Although it has long been understood that transmission within households is not binomial, it is thought that multiple generations of transmission can be neglected safely when p is small. We use probability generating functions and simulations to show that this is a mistake. The proportion of susceptible household members infected can be substantially larger than the SAR even when p is small. As a result, binomial estimates of the SAR are biased upward and their confidence intervals have poor coverage probabilities even if adjusted for clustering. Accurate point and interval estimates of the SAR can be obtained using longitudinal chain binomial models or pairwise survival analysis, which account for multiple generations of transmission within households, the ongoing risk of infection from outside the household, and incomplete follow-up. We illustrate the practical implications of these results in an analysis of household surveillance data collected by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health during the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic.","Sharker, Yushuf; Kenah, Eben",PLoS Comput Biol,,587

418214,Compensation and discipline of trading business sector as a performance measurement in West Java during Covid 19,2021,"With the commercial launch of 5G technologies and fast pace of expansion of cellular network infrastructure, it is expected that cellular and mobile networks traffic will exponentially increase. In addition, new services are expected to spread widely, such as the Internet of Things connected to mobile networks. This will add additional burden in terms of traffic load. As a result, some studies suggest that mobile traffic may increase more than 1000 times compared to the amount of traffic that is generated nowadays. This means that network resources for mobile services must be managed and controlled in a smart way, because resources are always limited, but the demand for services and the need for keeping user equipment always connected to mobile networks can be considered unlimited, leaving gap between huge service demands and available resources. In order to narrow this gap, major consideration should be given to the management of network resources to avoid network congestion and performance degradation during peak hour/s and traffic spikes, and allow access to network services to more customers when demand is high. On the other hand, guaranteeing quality of service requirements for the wide range of new services is another challenge that must be met in 5G networks. In this paper we will review 5G networks characteristics and specifications, then carry out a survey on resource management and QoS provisioning to improve and manage resource utilization in 5G networks.","Kayyali, Sam",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.09601v1.pdf,587

METHODS: Totally 75 COVID-19 patients admitted to The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine from January 22, 2020 to February 29, 2020 were recruited and grouped based on whether or not LPV/r and ARB were jointly used and whether or not Methylprednisolone was used. Indexes including body temperature, time for nucleic acid negative conversion, hospital stays and laboratory indexes were examined and compared. RESULTS: For all patients, there were no significant differences in the change of body temperature, the time for negative conversion and hospital stays whether LPV/r and ARB were jointly used or not. While for severe and critically severe patients, Methylprednisolone noticeably reduced the time for negative conversion. Meanwhile, the clinical efficacy was superior on patients receiving Methylprednisolone within 3 days upon admission, and the duration of hospital stays was much shorter when Methylprednisolone was given at a total dose of 0-400 mg than a higher dose of >400 mg if all patients received a similar dose per day. Nonetheless, no significant changes across hepatic, renal and myocardial function indexes were observed. CONCLUSION: LPV/r combined with ARB produced no noticeably better effect on COVID-19 patients relative to the single agent treatment. Additionally, Methylprednisolone was efficient in severe and critically severe cases, and superior efficacy could be realized upon its early, appropriate and short-term application.

Crossing the species barrier it entered human beings with furtherance of infection through human to human transmission. As studies indicate that people perceive COVID-19 as a threatening disease, the demand for a vaccine against the disease could be expected to be high. Vaccine safety concerns might nevertheless outweigh the perceived disease risks when an individual decides whether or not to accept the vaccine. We investigated the role of perceived risk of COVID-19 (i.e., perceived likelihood of infection, perceived disease severity, and disease-related worry) and perceived safety of a prospective vaccine against COVID-19 in predicting intentions to accept a COVID-19 vaccine. Three Finnish samples were surveyed: 825 parents of small children, 205 individuals living in an area with suboptimal vaccination coverage, and 1325 Facebook users nationwide. As points of reference, we compared the perceptions of COVID-19 to those of influenza and measles. COVID-19 was perceived as a threatening disease—more so than influenza and measles. The strongest predictor of COVID-19 vaccination intentions trusted the safety of the potential vaccine. Those perceiving COVID-19 as a severe disease were also slightly more intent on taking a COVID-19 vaccine. Informing the public about the safety of a forthcoming COVID-19 vaccine should be the focus for health authorities aiming to achieve a high vaccine uptake. The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a major threat to public health and has had a significant impact on all aspects of life. An effective vaccine is the most anticipated resolution.

In the light of the research (and the literature data), it can be stated that the coronavirus epidemic that appeared in Hungary in the spring of 2020 caused panic shopping, and the freedom of choice (abundance of goods) was again replaced by consumer vulnerability like before the years of regime change. The analysis shows that 75 percent of those over the age of 60, while only 62 percent of the members of the youngest age group think it is worth piling up. It is also interesting to note that the main reason for over-buying is the creation of a contingency reserve. Larger store types, mostly with a wide range of goods, were well suited for this. Also, 33,2 % of respondents thought they had bought more to reduce the number of shopping trips (and thus presumably to slow down the spread of the virus).

427113,Nursing people with Parkinson's disease,2020,"The ongoing pandemic has demonstrated the utility of widespread surveillance and diagnostic detection of the novel SARS-CoV-2. Reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) has enabled broader testing, but current LAMP tests only detect single targets and require separate reactions for controls. With flu season in the Northern Hemisphere, the ability to screen for multiple targets will be increasingly important, and the ability to include internal controls in RT-LAMP allows for improved efficiency. Here we describe multiplexed RT-LAMP with four targets (SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B, human RNA) in a single reaction using real-time and end point fluorescence detection. Such increased functionality of RT-LAMP will enable even broader adoption of this molecular testing approach and aid in the fight against this public health threat.","Zhang, Yinhua; Tanner, Nathan A",Biotechniques,,587

We use probabilistic modeling based on Gaussian processes (GPs). We illustrate that it is possible to build an accurate GP model of a 51-dimensional PES based on 5000 randomly distributed ab initio calculations with a global accuracy of <0.2 kcal/mol. Our approach uses GP models with composite kernels designed to enhance the Bayesian information content and represents the global PES as a sum of a full-dimensional GP and several GP models for molecular fragments of lower dimensionality. We demonstrate the potency of these algorithms by constructing the global PES for the protonated imidazole dimer, a molecular system with 19 atoms. We illustrate that GP models thus constructed can extrapolate the PES from low energies (<10 000 cm-1), yielding a PES at high energies (>20 000 cm-1). This opens the prospect for new applications of GPs, such as mapping out phase transitions by extrapolation or accelerating Bayesian optimization, for high-dimensional physics and chemistry problems with a restricted number of inputs, i.e., for high-dimensional problems where obtaining training data is very difficult.","Sugisawa, Hiroki; Ida, Tomonori; Krems, R V",J Chem Phys,,587

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: COVID-19 emergency shocked national health systems, subtracting resources from treatment of other diseases. Its impact on surgical oncology is still to elucidate. METHODS: A 56-question survey regarding the oncological surgical activity in Italy during the COVID-19 emergency was sent to referral centers for hepato-bilio-pancreatic, colorectal, esophago-gastric, and sarcoma/soft-tissue tumors. The survey portrays the situation 5 weeks after the first case of secondary transmission in Italy. RESULTS: In total, 54 surgical Units in 36 Hospitals completed the survey (95%). After COVID-19 emergency, 70% of Units had reduction of hospital beds (median -50%) and 76% of surgical activity (median -50%). The number of surgical procedures decreased: 3.8 (interquartile range 2.7-5.4) per week before the emergency versus 2.6 (22-4.4) after (P = 0.036). In Lombardy, the most involved district, the number decreased from 3.9 to 2 procedures per week. The time interval between multidisciplinary discussion and surgery more than doubled: 7 (6-10) versus 3 (3-4) weeks (P < 0.001). Two-third (n = 34) of departments had repeat multidisciplinary discussion of patients. The commonest criteria to prioritize surgery were tumor biology (80%), time interval from neoadjuvant therapy (61%), risk of becoming unresectable (57%), and tumor-related symptoms (52%). Oncological hub-and-spoke program was planned in 29 departments, but was active only in 10 (19%). CONCLUSIONS: This survey showed how surgical oncology suffered remarkable reduction of the activity resulting in doubled waiting-list. The oncological hub-and-spoke program did not work adequately. The reassessment of healthcare systems to better protect the oncological path seems a priority.","Torzilli, Guido; Vigano, Luca; Galvanin, Jacopo; Castoro, Carlo; Quagliuolo, Vittorio; Spinelli, Antonino; Zerbi, Alessandro; Donadon, Matteo; Montorsi, Marco",Ann. surg,,587
436145,Factors affecting students' intentions to undertake online learning: an empirical study in Vietnam,2021,"Introduction The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) virus was declared a pandemic on March 10, 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO) and has massively burdened healthcare systems with cases exponentially rising throughout the United States and the rest of the world. Since implementing precautions to reduce the spread of this disease, emergency departments have seen a decrease in the number of traumas. By evaluating the differences in the number of trauma admissions in different subgroups of patients, we can assess where to target messaging to increase compliance with these precautions. In this study, we aim to analyze the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on trauma admissions. Methodology This was a retrospective review of the trauma database at our institution, a level 2 trauma center in Southern California, to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the number of traumas. The inclusion criteria were patients activated as traumas, regardless of age. Patients were excluded from the study if they did not have complete information in the trauma database. Data were stratified by date into two groups: (a) COVID period (January to April 2020) and (b) pre-COVID period (January to April 2019). The primary endpoint of this study was to determine whether there was a significant change in the number of patients presenting as trauma during the COVID-19 pandemic. This difference was analyzed and divided into subgroups based on age and trauma type. Results In our review, an average of 279 patients per month presented as trauma from January to April in 2019, and an average of 222 patients per month presented as trauma from January to April 2020 (p = 0.049). We found a significant decrease in the number of patients presenting with the chief complaint of fall and vehicular accident, but a nonsignificant difference in patients presenting as assaults or pedestrian accidents. There was also a significant decrease in the number of traumas in the 18-39 and 65+ age groups and a nonsignificant decrease in the 40-64 age group. It was also noted that the number of trauma admissions in May 2020 increased to 253 compared to 269 in 2019. This increase was most notable in the 18-39 and 40-64 age groups. Discussion As seen in the data, the most notable year-over-year difference was seen in March and April. In California specifically, a stay-at-home order was set in place in March, which was in conjunction with the WHO's declaration of a pandemic. An interesting finding was the significant decrease in patients with traumas in the age groups of 18-39 and 65+ from 2019 to 2020. There was a smaller, nonsignificant decrease in patients aged 40-64. This would be a good group to target with future messaging to increase compliance with health advisories. There was also a notable increase in the number of traumas in May 2020, signaling an end to the cooperation of the majority of people, also indicating that further measures needed to be enacted in all groups. Conclusions COVID-19 has disrupted social structures worldwide. As the pandemic continued, even the observers of stay-at-home and social distancing measures, the 18-39 age group, became fatigued with the guidelines and ventured out into the warming weather and summer activities. This difference in trauma admission due to COVID-19 between subsequent years can highlight the behavioral changes in our patient population and can be further extrapolated to target additional messaging to help reduce the spread of COVID-19.","Savla, P.; Wiginton, J. th Taka T.

451988,Categories for non-compliance of movement control order in Malaysia: A review through online news report,2021,"Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic posed significant challenges to the instruction of in-person cadaveric dissection. Compared to previous years, there was a 66% reduction in student lab dissection times for the first-year medical students (MS1s) at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center. Complete Anatomy (CA), a three-dimensional (3D) anatomy atlas, was provided as an additional educational resource to supplement the in person cadaveric dissection labs. The aim of this study is to increase student engagement by producing tailored anatomical modules in CA and to evaluate their effects on students? stress levels and summative practical exam performance throughout the Clinically Oriented Anatomy (COA) block. We hypothesized that the CA modules would allow current MS1s to perform to the same academic standard as students who did not have these COVID-19 limitations and reduce their exam stress. Methods Learning modules were created that displayed 3D anatomical structures corresponding to each of the 27 COA in person dissection labs. The CA modules consisted of content and quizzes that MS1s could access either outside or inside the lab. At the end of each of the three COA units and at the end of the COA block, students were surveyed about their participation and satisfaction with the modules. Students? performance on module quizzes was compared to their performance on summative practical exams. Additionally, the Class of 2023?s performance in COA was compared to the Class of 2024?s, with the latter taking the block under pandemic restrictions. Results Throughout the block, 82%-95% (unit 1 n=97/102, unit 2 n=67/72, unit 3 n=107/130) of survey respondents reported using the modules as a study aid and 55%-79% used the modules for all 27 anatomy labs. Additionally, 75%-87% of MS1s rated the modules as ?very useful? or higher on a Likert-scale survey, with a majority of surveyed students using both the content and quizzes. At the end of the block a second survey showed 74% (n=70/94) of students ?strongly agreed? or ?agreed? that using the modules reduced their stress, and 80% (n=75/94) ?strongly agreed? or ?agreed? that modules allowed them to continue their learning outside of the lab. MS1 performance in the COA block was positively correlated with performance on CA quizzes (r=0.46, p&lt;0.0001). Further, there was no significant difference between the 2023 and 2024 MS1 classes in summative practical exam scores for units 1 and 3, as well as in the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) exam. However, there was a significant increase in summative practical exam performance in the Class of 2024 for unit 2 (p&lt;0.0001) as compared to the Class of 2023. Conclusion Findings suggest that the CA modules facilitated student engagement in anatomy and positively enhanced their medical education throughout the COA block.

454213,Persepsi Orangtua Terhadap Pelaksanaan Belajar Dari Rumah Pada Pendidikan Anak Usia Dini,2021,"This is a report on the first identified cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Austria. The first documented case was a person who stayed in Kühtai, Tyrol, from 24 to 26 January 2020, and had been infected by a Chinese instructor in Starnberg (Germany) between 20 and 22 January. This counts as a German case since her diagnosis was eventually made in Munich (Germany) on 28 January. On 25 February, two cases imported from Italy were diagnosed in Innsbruck but again no secondary cases were identified in Austria. The first three infections of Austrian inhabitants were detected on 27 February in Vienna. The two resulting clusters finally included 6 (source of initial infection unknown) and 61 cases. Most likely, Italy was the source of the latter cluster. On 12 March the first fatal case of COVID-19 in Austria was reported, a 69-year-old Viennese who died in a Vienna hospital after returning from a cruise ship tour in Italy. On 6 March three autochthonously acquired cases were reported in the Tyrol, all related to the ski resort Ischgl. Of the first 14 Islandic COVID-19 cases infected in Ischgl, 11 had already returned to Iceland on 29 February. We consider that the incriminated barkeeper, who tested PCR positive on 7 March, was neither the primary case nor a superspreader. In our opinion, undetected transmission of SARS-CoV­2 had been ongoing in Ischgl prior to the first laboratory confirmed cases. Our data also underline that the introduction of SARS-CoV­2 into Austria was not one single event.","Kreidl, Peter; Schmid, Daniela; Maritschnik, Sabine; Richter, Lukas; Borena, Wegene; Genger, Jakob-Wendelin; Popa, Alexandra; Penz, Thomas; Bock, Christoph; Bergthaler, Andreas; Allerberger, Franz",Wien Klin Wochenschr,,587

Dental monitoring (DM) is a recently introduced orthodontic application that combines safe teledentistry with artificial intelligence (AI) using a knowledge-based algorithm, allowing an accurate semi-automatic monitoring of the treatment. Dental Monitoring is the world's first SaaS (Software as a Service) application designed for remote monitoring of dental treatment, developed in Paris, France, with Philippe Salah as the Co-founder and CEO. CASES PRESENTATION: This report describes two cases in which DM system was essential to achieve the control of certain movements: it was possible to follow the movement, even if complex, such as the anterior cross of an adult patient and a lack of space in the canine of the growing patient. The software analyzed the fit and retention of the aligner, thus ensuring correct biomechanics. They were treated during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown with aligners. The first case is a growing patient who was monitored during an interceptive orthodontic treatment to manage a retained upper canine. The second case is an adult patient forced to finalize his treatment of upper lateral incisor crossbite. The software analyzed the fit and retention of the aligner, thus ensuring correct biomechanics. CONCLUSIONS: DM system appears to be a promising method, useful for improving the interaction between doctor and patient, generally acceptable and useful to patients, even in critical clinical situations, at least in cases with optimal compliance and ability to use the tool properly.","Caruso, Silvia; Caruso, Sara; Pellegrino, Marianna; Skafi, Rayan; Nota, Alessandro; Tecco, Simona",Sensors (Basel),,587

459659,Manifestations neurologiques associées à l’infection SARS-CoV-2 : le registre français NeuroCOVID,2020,"On March 19, 2020, the governor of California issued a statewide stay-at-home order to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).* The order reduced accessibility to and patient attendance at outpatient medical visits, including preventive services such as cervical cancer screening. In-person clinic visits increased when California reopened essential businesses on June 12, 2020.§ Electronic medical records of approximately 1.5 million women served by Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC), a large integrated health care system, were examined to assess cervical cancer screening rates before, during, and after the stay-at-home order. KPSC policy is to screen women aged 21-29 years every 3 years with cervical cytology alone (Papanicolaou [Pap] test); those aged 30-65 years were screened every 5 years with human papillomavirus (HPV) testing and cytology (cotesting) through July 15, 2020, and after July 15, 2020, with HPV testing alone, consistent with the latest recommendations from U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.¶ Compared with the 2019 baseline, cervical cancer screening rates decreased substantially during the stay-at-home order. Among women aged 21-29 years, cervical cytology screening rates per 100 person-months declined 78%. Among women aged 30-65 years, HPV test screening rates per 100 person-months decreased 82%. After the stay-at-home order was lifted, screening rates returned to near baseline, which might have been aided by aspects of KPSC's integrated, organized screening program (e.g., reminder systems and tracking persons lost to follow-up). As the pandemic continues, groups at higher risk for developing cervical cancers and precancers should be evaluated first. Ensuring that women receive preventive services, including cancer screening and appropriate follow-up in a safe and timely manner, remains important.","Miller, Maureen J; Xu, Lanfang; Qin, Jin; Hahn, Erin E; Ngo-Metzger, Quyen; Mittman, Brian; Tewari, Devansu; Hodeib, Melissa; Wride, Patricia; Saraiya, Mona; Chao, Chun R",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,587

The current study investigates beliefs and tobacco use behaviors and COVID-19 infection among a sample of smokers and never-smokers. Data were collected using an online survey distributed through Telegram, a cloud-based social media networking application in Iran from April 1 to May 31, 2020. The study participants included never-smokers (n = 511), current (past-month) waterpipe smokers (n = 89), current cigarette smokers (n = 158), and ex-smokers (n = 172). Multinomial logistic regression was used to compare tobacco use groups with never- smokers on beliefs, controlling for potential confounders. The study participants (n = 944) was mostly male (64%), had > high school education (76%), and lived in an urban area (91%), with mean ± SD age of 35.3 ± 10.8. Key findings of this study are that compared with never-smokers: (1) cigarette smokers were less likely to believe that smoking cigarette can lead to spreading COVID-19; (2) waterpipe smokers were more likely to believe that smoking waterpipe at home was a safe practice, that waterpipe protects against COVID-19, and smoking waterpipe may lead to a more rapid recovery from COVID-19; (3) both waterpipe and cigarette smokers believed that using e-cigarettes in public places was a safe practice during the COVID-19 pandemic; and (4) more than half of the ex-smokers stopped smoking due to COVID-19 and most of them planned to continue abstaining from smoking after the pandemic. Our findings underscore the need to raise awareness about the unsupported claims of a lower hazard of using tobacco products or possible protective effects against COVID-19 and to promote cessation programs.","Kalan, Mohammad Ebrahimi; Ghobadi, Hassan; Taleb, Ziyad Ben; Adham, Davoud; Cobb, Caroline O; Ward, Kenneth D; Behaleh, Raed; Fazlzadeh, Mehdi",,,587

469758,What's App integrity in the life science concept during the covid-19 pandemic,2021,"The rapid increase in the percentage of chronic disease patients along with the recent pandemic pose immediate threats on healthcare expenditure and elevate causes of death. This calls for transforming healthcare systems away from one-on-one patient treatment into intelligent health systems, to improve services, access and scalability, while reducing costs. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has witnessed an intrinsic breakthrough in solving a variety of complex problems for diverse applications and services. Thus, we conduct in this paper a comprehensive survey of the recent models and techniques of RL that have been developed/used for supporting Intelligent-healthcare (I-health) systems. This paper can guide the readers to deeply understand the state-of-the-art regarding the use of RL in the context of I-health. Specifically, we first present an overview for the I-health systems challenges, architecture, and how RL can benefit these systems. We then review the background and mathematical modeling of different RL, Deep RL (DRL), and multi-agent RL models. After that, we provide a deep literature review for the applications of RL in I-health systems. In particular, three main areas have been tackled, i.e., edge intelligence, smart core network, and dynamic treatment regimes. Finally, we highlight emerging challenges and outline future research directions in driving the future success of RL in I-health systems, which opens the door for exploring some interesting and unsolved problems.","Abdellatif, Alaa Awad; Mhaisen, Naram; Chkirbene, Zina; Mohamed, Amr; Erbad, Aiman; Guizani, Mohsen",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.04087v1.pdf,587
472988,Work life balance during Covid pandemic,2021,"Preexisting cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 occurs in the absence of prior viral exposure. However, this has been difficult to quantify at the population level due to a lack of reliably defined seroreactivity thresholds. Using an orthogonal antibody testing approach, we estimated that about 0.6% of nontriaged adults from the greater Vancouver, Canada, area between May 17 and June 19, 2020, showed clear evidence of a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, after adjusting for false-positive and false-negative test results. Using a highly sensitive multiplex assay and positive/negative thresholds established in infants in whom maternal antibodies have waned, we determined that more than 90% of uninfected adults showed antibody reactivity against the spike protein, receptor-binding domain (RBD), N-terminal domain (NTD), or the nucleocapsid (N) protein from SARS-CoV-2. This seroreactivity was evenly distributed across age and sex, correlated with circulating coronaviruses' reactivity, and was partially outcompeted by soluble circulating coronaviruses' spike. Using a custom SARS-CoV-2 peptide mapping array, we found that this antibody reactivity broadly mapped to spike and to conserved nonstructural viral proteins. We conclude that most adults display preexisting antibody cross-reactivity against SARS-CoV-2, which further supports investigation of how this may impact the clinical severity of COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 vaccine responses.","Majdoubi, Abdelilah; Michalski, Christina; O039,; Connell, Sarah E; Dada, Sarah; Narpala, Sandeep; Gelinas, Jean; Mehta, Disha; Cheung, Claire; Winkler, Dirk Fh; Basappa, Manjula; Liu, Aaron C; Görges, Matthias; Barakauskas, Vilte E; Irvine, Mike; Mehalko, Jennifer; Esposito, Dominic; Sekirov, Inna; Jassem, Agatha N; Goldfarb, David M; Pelech, Steven; Douek, Daniel C; McDermott, Adrian B; Lavoie, Pascal M",JCI insight,,587

EBV can directly cause infectious mononucleosis and is also associated with various malignancies and autoimmune diseases. In order to prevent primary infection and subsequent chronic disease, efforts have been made to develop a prophylactic vaccine against EBV in recent years, but there is still no vaccine in clinical use. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and the global cooperation in vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2 provide insights for next-generation antiviral vaccine design and opportunities for developing an effective prophylactic EBV vaccine. With improvements in antigen selection, vaccine platforms, formulation and evaluation systems, novel vaccines against EBV are expected to elicit dual protection against infection of both B lymphocytes and epithelial cells. This would provide sustainable immunity against EBV-associated malignancies, finally enabling the control of worldwide EBV infection and management of EBV-associated diseases.","Sun, Cong; Chen, Xin-Chun; Kang, Yin-Feng; Zeng, Mu-Sheng",Front Immunol,,587
477503,"GPS tracking, QR code scanner based application to help the health workers and common citizens during COVID-19",2021,"The Competition Commission of India’s (CCI) journey with “control” has been the subject of much discussion in Indian competition law circles. As we witness an increase in reliance on technology as well as a consolidation in conventional industries, both catalyzed by the Covid-19 pandemic, there is a marked increase of activity in the Indian merger market. It is therefore crucial for businesses contemplating mergers and acquisitions, to have a clear sense of the hurdles they need to cross, particularly if the merger activity in question falls in the same or a related industry. The CCI would thus need to provide clarity on what constitutes control, and when transacting parties should approach the CCI. The CCI must also be transparent about control transactions resulting in anti-competitive effects. This paper proposes that the CCI provide guidance on what amounts to control, from the perspectives of both notifiability and competitive effects, to resolve the CCI’s control quandary.

483454,Online-Based Academic Supervision during the Covid-19 Pandemic,2021,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is placing significant pressure on national and international health organizations and the measures taken to combat it are having many impacts beyond health. At the same time, misleading communication practices and what has been called an “infodemic” by the World Health Organization have been hampering the uptake of coronavirus-related scientific information. Moreover, public awareness about the dangers of the infodemic remains poor, and misinformation may lead to hazardous behaviours. We therefore analysed factors potentially undermining communication of scientific evidence and proposed strategies to counteract this phenomenon. Methods: We sought official academic and institutional publications of any type, published in English and analyzed their approaches to communication used during the pandemic. Results: The factors that might undermine appropriate communication include but are not limited to (a) the exponential increase of COVID-19-related publications, often including biases in the peer-review and editorial process;(b) the role of traditional media;(c) politicization of the virus;and (d) the impact of social media. We argue that evidence synthesis and knowledge translation are useful tools to communicate accurate scientific evidence to decision-makers. Conclusion: Clear and concise messages in this form can help decision-makers to interpret data correctly, take consequent actions, and avoid being compromised by low-quality or even misleading information.","La Bella, Epaminondas Allen Claire Lirussi Flavio",Integrative Medicine Research,,587

Spatial analysis identified 5 clusters with high prevalence of unvaccinated pregnant women. The proportion of unvaccinated ranged from 57% to 75% within clusters compared to 51% outside clusters. In covariate-adjusted analyses,, residence in a cluster was associated with a 41% increase in the odds of being unvaccinated (OR = 1.41, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.36,1.46).

METHODS: Twenty consecutive patients from a Long-term COVID-19 Clinic referred to electrophysiological examination with the suspicion of mono- or polyneuropathy were included. Examinations were performed from 77 to 255 (median: 216) days after acute COVID-19. None of the patients had received treatment at the intensive care unit. Of these, 10 patients were not even hospitalized. Conventional nerve conduction studies (NCS) and quantitative electromyography (qEMG) findings from three muscles were compared with 20 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. RESULTS: qEMG showed myopathic changes in one or more muscles in 11 patients (55%). Motor unit potential duration was shorter in patients compared to healthy controls in biceps brachii (10.02 ± 0.28 vs 11.75 ± 0.21), vastus medialis (10.86 ± 0.37 vs 12.52 ± 0.19) and anterior tibial (11.76 ± 0.31 vs 13.26 ± 0.21) muscles. All patients with myopathic qEMG reported about physical fatigue and 8 patients about myalgia while 3 patients without myopathic changes complained about physical fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term COVID-19 does not cause large fibre neuropathy, but myopathic changes are seen. SIGNIFICANCE: Myopathy may be an important cause of physical fatigue in long-term COVID-19 even in non-hospitalized patients.","Agergaard, J; Leth, S; Pedersen, T H; Harbo, T; Blicher, J U; Karlsson, P; Østergaard, L; Andersen, H; Tankisi, H",Clin. neurophysiol,,587
489345,Measuring the sustainability and resilience of blood supply chains,2021,"Although close contact represents an important contagion route, the mechanism of exposure to exhaled droplets remains insufficiently characterized. In this study, an integrated risk assessment is presented for SARS-CoV-2 close contact exposure between a speaking infectious subject and a susceptible subject. It is based on a three-dimensional transient numerical model for the description of exhaled droplet spread once emitted by a speaking person, coupled with a recently proposed SARS-CoV-2 emission approach. Particle image velocimetry measurements were conducted to validate the numerical model. The contribution of large droplets to infection risk is dominant for distances<0.6 m, whereas for longer distances, the exposure risk depends only on airborne droplets. In particular, for short exposures (10 s) a minimum safety distance of 0.75 m should be maintained to lower the risk below 0.1%; for exposures of 1 and 15 min this distance increases to about 1.0 and 1.5 m, respectively. Based on the interpersonal distances across countries reported as a function of interacting individuals, cultural differences, and environmental and sociopsychological factors, the approach presented here revealed that, in addition to intimate and personal distances, particular attention must be paid to exposures longer than 1 min within social distances (of about 1 m).","Cortellessa, Gino; Stabile, Luca; Arpino, Fausto; Faleiros, David E.; Bos, Wouter van den; Morawska, Lidia; Buonanno, Giorgio",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.10934v1.pdf,587

Here, we present the heretofore cryptic mutational history and spatiotemporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 from an analysis of thousands of high-quality genomes. We report the likely most recent common ancestor of SARS-CoV-2, reconstructed through a novel application and advancement of computational methods initially developed to infer the mutational history of tumor cells in a patient. This progenitor genome differs from genomes of the first coronaviruses sampled in China by three variants, implying that none of the earliest patients represent the index case or gave rise to all the human infections. However, multiple coronavirus infections in China and the USA harbored the progenitor genetic fingerprint in January 2020 and later, suggesting that the progenitor was spreading worldwide months before and after the first reported cases of COVID-19 in China. Mutations of the progenitor and its offshoots have produced many dominant coronavirus strains, which have spread episodically over time. Fingerprinting based on common mutations reveals that the same coronavirus lineage has dominated North America for most of the pandemic in 2020. There have been multiple replacements of predominant coronavirus strains in Europe and Asia and the continued presence of multiple high-frequency strains in Asia and North America. We have developed a continually updating dashboard of global evolution and spatiotemporal trends of SARS-CoV-2 spread (http://sars2evo.datamonkey.org/).","Kumar, Sudhir; Tao, Qiqing; Weaver, Steven; Sanderford, Maxwell; Caraballo-Ortiz, Marcos A; Sharma, Sudip; Pond, Sergei L K; Miura, Sayaka",Mol. biol. evol,,587

The performance is measured by the difference between the non-negative consumption rate and a fraction of the historical consumption maximum. The consumption running maximum process is chosen as an auxiliary state process that renders the value function two dimensional. The Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation can be heuristically expressed in a piecewise manner across different regions to take into account all constraints. By employing the dual transform and smooth-fit principle, some thresholds of the wealth variable are derived such that the classical solution to the HJB equation and the feedback optimal investment and consumption strategies can be obtained in the closed form in each region. The complete proof of the verification theorem is provided and numerical examples are presented to illustrate some financial implications.","Deng, Shuoqing; Li, Xun; Pham, Huyen; Yu, Xiang",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.07223v3.pdf,587

While lectures could be more readily converted to online classes, biology labs were challenging to handle since students could not physically conduct experiments in lab classrooms. In the present report, various online teaching materials, including educational and research videos, simulation labs, and real research data, were utilized to achieve the learning objectives of the originally in-person lab classes of an upper-level undergraduate genetics course. Furthermore, certain advantages of online teaching, such as detailed and high-quality annotation of lecture slides using the Apple Pencil and iPad, were observed. While online teaching has its unique strengths, it could not provide students with hands-on experience in performing real biology experiments to master technical skills; the latter are essential for students to develop a career in conducting research in an academic or industrial laboratory setting. Hence, a well-designed hybrid modality of using online teaching to complement conventional face-to-face instruction may allow for better teaching in undergraduate biology courses.","Zhou, Chun",Biochem Mol Biol Educ,,587

To minimize this risk, we transformed the oxygen mask into a fully closed negative-pressure gastroscope isolation mask. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness, safety, and feasibility of use of this mask during gastroscopy. METHODS: From February 28, 2020, to March 10, 2020, 320 patients undergoing gastroscopy were randomly assigned into the mask group (n = 160) or conventional group (n = 160). Patients in the mask group wore the isolation mask during gastroscopy, whereas patients in the conventional group did not wear the mask. The adenosine triphosphate fluorescence and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration in patients' exhaled air were measured to reflect the degree of environmental pollution by exhaled air. Patients' vital signs, operation time, and adverse events during endoscopy were also evaluated. RESULTS: Four patients were excluded because of noncooperation or incomplete data. A total of 316 patients were included in the final analysis. The difference between the highest CO2 concentration around patients' mouth and CO2 concentration in the environment was significantly decreased in the mask group compared with the conventional group. There was no significant difference in the adenosine triphosphate fluorescence, vital signs, and operation time between the 2 groups. No severe adverse events related to the isolation mask, endoscopy failure, or new coronavirus infection during follow-up were recorded. DISCUSSION: This new isolation mask showed excellent feasibility of use and safety compared with routine gastroscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Gao, Yuan; Xie, Jia; Ye, Lian-Song; Du, Jiang; Zhang, Qiong-Ying; Hu, Bing",Clin Transl Gastroenterol,,587

522896,Assessing the quality of evidence from epidemiological agent-based models for the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"The occurrence of a natural disaster in an area already coping with an epidemic, constitutes a multi-hazard event. Such events are more likely than ever during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In regions that seasonally experience extreme-weather disasters, such multi-hazard crises are imminent. People living along the Dead Sea Fault and in the Negev are used to harsh weather conditions and to the hardship of living in isolation. While self-reliance and community-support are often the norm in the daily life of residents in in peripheral communities, in an emergency they may be crucial for survival. Worldwide remote communities with limited response and medical infrastructure and resources may struggle to cope with the aftermath of an earthquake while potentially coping with a concurrent epidemic or extreme weather. In this work we focus on the effect of concurring disasters and seasonal stressors. In particular we discuss how various disasters would affect the Covid-19 infection rate, and we demonstrate that in Israel's periphery cities, heat-stress is a consistent and significant seasonal stressor that would hamper emergency and recovery operations. We also suggest that transient tourist population in these remote cities is expected to burden local emergency efforts and facilities. A seasonal over burden parameter is proposed to describe how seasonal tourism and weather conditions enhance the hardship and risk in a multi-hazard situation. A case study shows that high-resolution spatial analysis of risk and preparedness together with a temporal analysis of seasonal effects, may be used to detect specific neighborhoods with high or low resilience and capacity to cope with disasters. Our work demonstrates the need for spatial and temporal, multi-hazard analysis for improving local resilience and emergency plans in periphery cities and communities exposed to seasonal harsh weather. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Finzi, Y.; Ganz, N.; Limon, Y.; Langer, S.",International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction,,587
522897,Assessing the quality of evidence from epidemiological agent-based models for the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: Conservative management is recognized as an acceptable treatment for people with worsening chronic kidney disease; however, patients consistently report they lack understanding about their changing disease state and feel unsupported in making shared decisions about future treatment. The purpose of this review was to critically evaluate patient decision aids (PtDAs) developed to support patient-professional shared decision-making between dialysis and conservative management treatment pathways. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of resources accessible in English using environmental scan methods. Data sources included online databases of research publications, repositories for clinical guidelines, research projects and PtDAs, international PtDA expert lists and reference lists from relevant publications. The resource selection was from 56 screened records; 17 PtDAs were included. A data extraction sheet was applied to all eligible resources, eliciting resource characteristics, decision architecture to boost/bias thinking, indicators of quality such as International Standards for Patient Decision Aids Standards checklist and engagement with health services. RESULTS: PtDAs were developed in five countries; eleven were publically available via the Internet. Treatment options described were dialysis (n = 17), conservative management (n = 9) and transplant (n = 5). Eight resources signposted conservative management as an option rather than an active choice. Ten different labels across 14 resources were used to name 'conservative management'. The readability of the resources was good. Six publications detail decision aid development and/or evaluation research. Using PtDAs improved treatment decision-making by patients. Only resources identified as PtDAs and available in English were included. CONCLUSIONS: PtDAs are used by some services to support patients choosing between dialysis options or end-of-life options. PtDAs developed to proactively support people making informed decisions between conservative management and dialysis treatments are likely to enable services to meet current best practice.","Winterbottom, Anna E; Mooney, Andrew; Russon, Lynne; Hipkiss, Vicki; Ziegler, Lucy; Williams, Richard; Finderup, Jeanette; Bekker, Hilary L",Nephrol. dial. transplant,,587

Because of the particularity of COVID-19, people are at a high risk of pressure injuries during the prevention and treatment process of COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: This systematic review aimed to summarize the pressure injuries caused by COVID-19 and the corresponding preventive measures and treatments. METHODS: This systematic review was according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. PubMed, Web of science and CNKI (Chinese) were searched for studies on pressure injuries caused by COVID-19 published up to August 4, 2020. The quality of included studies was assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS) and the CARE guidelines. RESULTS: The data were extracted from 16 studies involving 7,696 participants in 7 countries. All studies were published in 2020. There are two main types of pressure injuries caused by the COVID-19: 1) Pressure injuries that caused by protective equipment (masks, goggles and face shield, etc.) in the prevention process; 2) pressure injuries caused by prolonged prone position in the therapy process. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review, the included studies showed that wearing protective equipment for a long time and long-term prone positioning with mechanical ventilation will cause pressure injuries in the oppressed area. Foam dressing may need to be prioritized in the prevention of medical device related pressure injuries. The prevention of pressure injuries should be our particular attention in the course of clinical treatment and nursing.","Yu, Jia-Ning; Wu, Bing-Bing; Feng, Li-Ping; Chen, Hong-Lin",J Tissue Viability,,587

DESIGN AND SETTING: This study reports the findings of a systematic review. The included studies report the rate or reasons of missed appointments in a primary care setting. METHOD: Databases were searched using a pre-defined search strategy. Eligible studies were selected for inclusion based on detailed inclusion criteria through title, abstract, and full text screening. Quality was assessed on all included studies, and findings were synthesised to answer the research questions. RESULTS: A total of 26 studies met the inclusion criteria for the review. Of these, 19 reported a rate of missed appointments. The mean rate of missed appointments was 15.2%, with a median of 12.9%. Twelve studies reported a reason that appointments were missed, with work or family/childcare commitments, forgetting the appointment, and transportation difficulties most commonly reported. In all, 20 studies reported characteristics of people likely to miss appointments. Patients who were likely to miss appointments were those from minority ethnicity, low sociodemographic status, and younger patients (<21 years).

HPAI H5N1 is now reported as the most widespread and expensive zoonotic disease recorded and continues to pose a global health threat. The aim of this research was to assess the potential of utilising Hazard Analysis of Critical Control Points (HACCP) assessments in providing a framework for a rapid response to emerging infectious disease outbreaks. This novel approach applies a scientific process, widely used in food production systems, to assess risks related to a specific emerging health threat within a known zoonotic disease hotspot. We conducted a HACCP assessment for HPAI viruses within Vietnam’s domestic poultry trade and relate our findings to the existing literature. Our HACCP assessment identified poultry flock isolation, transportation, slaughter, preparation and consumption as critical control points for Vietnam’s domestic poultry trade. Introduction of the preventative measures highlighted through this HACCP evaluation would reduce the risks posed by HPAI viruses and pressure on the national economy. We conclude that this HACCP assessment provides compelling evidence for the future potential that HACCP analyses could play in initiating a rapid response to emerging infectious diseases.","Edmunds, Kelly L.; Hunter, Paul R.; Few, Roger; Bell, Diana J.",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0072279; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23967294/,587

In light of the current pandemic the authors collated and clustered (using harmonised terminology) the risk mitigation measures taken around the globe in the combat to contain, and since March 11 2020, to limit the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus known to cause the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This overview gathers lessons learnt, providing an update on the current knowledge for authorities, sectors and first responders on the effectiveness of said measures, and may allow enhanced prevention, preparedness and response for future outbreaks. Various measures such as mobility restrictions, physical distancing, hygienic measures, socio-economic restrictions, communication and international support mechanisms have been clustered and are reviewed in terms of the nature of the actions taken and their qualitative early-perceived impact. At the time of writing, it is still too premature to express the quantitative effectiveness of each risk mitigation cluster, but it seems that the best mitigation results are reported when applying a combination of voluntary and enforceable measures.","Bruinen de Bruin, Yuri; Lequarre, Anne-Sophie; McCourt, Josephine; Clevestig, Peter; Pigazzani, Filippo; Zare Jeddi, Maryam; Colosio, Claudio; Goulart, Margarida",Saf Sci,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssci.2020.104773; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925753520301703?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32296266/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0925753520301703,587
629173,Technology supported learning and pedagogy in times of crisis: the case of COVID-19 pandemic,2021-08-26,"Indomethacin (INM), a well-known non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, has recently gained attention for its antiviral activity demonstrated in drug repurposing studies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although the mechanism of action of INM is not yet fully understood, recent studies have indicated that it acts at an early stage of the coronaviruses (CoVs) replication cycle. In addition, a proteomic study reported that the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of INM could be also ascribed to its ability to inhibit human prostaglandin E synthase type 2 (PGES-2), a host protein which interacts with the SARS-CoV-2 NSP7 protein. Although INM does not potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in infected Vero E6 cells, here we have explored for the first time the application of the Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras (PROTACs) technology in order to develop more potent INM-derived PROTACs with anti-CoV activity. In this study, we report the design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of a series of INM-based PROTACs endowed with antiviral activity against a panel of human CoVs, including different SARS-CoV-2 strains. Two PROTACs showed a strong improvement in antiviral potency compared to INM. Molecular modelling studies support human PGES-2 as a potential target of INM-based antiviral PROTACs, thus paving the way toward the development of host-directed anti-CoVs strategies. To the best of our knowledge, these PROTACs represent the first-in-class INM-based PROTACs with antiviral activity and also the first example of the application of PROTACs to develop pan-coronavirus agents.","Desantis, Jenny; Mercorelli, Beatrice; Celegato, Marta; Croci, Federico; Bazzacco, Alessandro; Baroni, Massimo; Siragusa, Lydia; Cruciani, Gabriele; Loregian, Arianna; Goracci, Laura",Eur J Med Chem,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmech.2021.113814; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0223523421006632; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0223523421006632?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34534839/,587

637254,Infección Grave Por Sars-Cov- 2: Valoración Clínica Y Evaluación Funcional Biomecánica Al Mes Del Alta Hospitalaria,2021-08-05,"Background: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID19) is currently a global public health threat. Outside of China, Italy is one of the most suffering countries with the COVID19 epidemic. It is important to predict the epidemics trend of COVID19 epidemic in Italy to help develop public health strategies. Methods: We used time series data of COVID 19 from Jan 22,2020 to Mar 16,2020. An infectious disease dynamic extended susceptible infected removed (eSIR) model, which covers the effects of different intervention measures in dissimilar periods, was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Italy. The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credible interval (CI). Hunan, with similar total number of populations in Italy, was used as a comparative item. Results: In the eSIR model, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for COVID 19 was respectively 4.10 (95% CI: 2.15 to 6.77) in Italy and 3.15(95% CI: 1.71 to 5.21) in Hunan. There would be totally 30 086 infected cases (95%CI:7920-81 869) under the current country blockade and the endpoint would be Apr 25 (95%CI: Mar 30 to Aug 07) in Italy. If the country blockade is imposed 5 day later, the total number of infected cases would expand the infection scale 1.50 times. Conclusion: Italy's current strict measures can efficaciously prevent the further spread of COVID19 and should be maintained. Necessary strict public health measures be implemented as soon as possible in other European countries with a high number of COVID19 cases. The most effective strategy needs to be confirmed in further studies.","Jia, Wangping; Han, Ke; Song, Yang; Cao, Wenzhe; Wang, Shengshu; Yang, Shanshan; Wang, Jianwei; Kou, Fuyin; Tai, Penggang; Li, Jing; Liu, Miao; He, Yao",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.18.20038570,587
644500,Improving employability skills through non-placement work-integrated learning in chemical and food engineering: A case study,2020-09-19,"[Image: see text] The performance of graphene devices is often limited by defects and impurities induced during device fabrication. Polymer residue left on the surface of graphene after photoresist processing can increase electron scattering and hinder electron transport. Furthermore, exposing graphene to plasma-based processing such as sputtering of metallization layers can increase the defect density in graphene and alter the device performance. Therefore, the preservation of the high-quality surface of graphene during thin-film deposition and device manufacturing is essential for many electronic applications. Here, we show that the use of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) as a buffer layer during the device fabrication of graphene can significantly reduce damage, improve the quality of graphene, and enhance device performance. The role of HMDS has been systematically investigated using surface analysis techniques and electrical measurements. The benefits of HMDS treatment include a significant reduction in defect density compared with as-treated graphene and more than a 2-fold reduction of contact resistance. This surface treatment is simple and offers a practical route for improving graphene device interfaces, which is important for the integration of graphene into functional devices such as electronics and sensor devices.","Ramadan, Sami; Zhang, Yuanzhou; Tsang, Deana Kwong Hong; Shaforost, Olena; Xu, Lizhou; Bower, Ryan; Dunlop, Iain E.; Petrov, Peter K.; Klein, Norbert",ACS Omega,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.0c05631; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33644584/,587

Therefore, livestock are important components of a “One Health” perspective aimed to control these viral infections. However, at present there is no example that considers pig genetic resources in this context. In this study, we investigated the variability of four genes (ACE2, ANPEP and DPP4 encoding for host receptors of the viral spike proteins and TMPRSS2 encoding for a host proteinase) in 23 European (19 autochthonous and three commercial breeds and one wild boar population) and two Asian Sus scrofa populations. A total of 2229 variants were identified in the four candidate genes: 26% of them were not previously described; 29 variants affected the protein sequence and might potentially interact with the infection mechanisms. The results coming from this work are a first step towards a “One Health” perspective that should consider conservation programs of pig genetic resources with twofold objectives: (i) genetic resources could be reservoirs of host gene variability useful to design selection programs to increase resistance to coronaviruses; (ii) the described variability in genes involved in coronavirus infections across many different pig populations might be part of a risk assessment including pig genetic resources.","Bovo, Samuele; Schiavo, Giuseppina; Ribani, Anisa; Utzeri, Valerio J.; Taurisano, Valeria; Ballan, Mohamad; Muñoz, Maria; Alves, Estefania; Araujo, Jose P.; Bozzi, Riccardo; Charneca, Rui; Di Palma, Federica; Djurkin Kušec, Ivona; Etherington, Graham; Fernandez, Ana I.; García, Fabián; García-Casco, Juan; Karolyi, Danijel; Gallo, Maurizio; Martins, José Manuel; Mercat, Marie-José; Núñez, Yolanda; Quintanilla, Raquel; Radović, Čedomir; Razmaite, Violeta; Riquet, Juliette; Savić, Radomir; Škrlep, Martin; Usai, Graziano; Zimmer, Christoph; Ovilo, Cristina; Fontanesi, Luca",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33564056/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-82956-0,587

An overview of mortality trends between 1990 and 2017 was also provided. In 2017, there were 254,336 new cancer cases in men and 214,994 in women, corresponding to an age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) of 438 and 330/100,000, respectively. Between 1990 and 2017, incident cancer cases, and, to a lesser extent, ASIRs significantly increased overall and for almost all cancer sites, but ASIRs significantly declined for lung and other tobacco-related neoplasms. In 2017, there were 101,659 cancer deaths in men (age-standardized death rate, ASDR, 158.5/100,000) and 78,918 in women (ASDR 93.9/100,000). Cancer deaths significantly increased between 1990 and 2017 (+ 18%), but ASDR significantly decreased (− 28%). Deaths significantly increased for many cancer sites, but decreased for stomach, esophageal, laryngeal, Hodgkin lymphoma, and testicular cancer. ASDRs significantly decreased for most neoplasms, with the main exceptions of cancer of the pancreas and uterus, and multiple myeloma. In 2017, cancer caused 3,204,000 DALYs. Between 1990 and 2017, DALYs and age-standardized DALY rates significantly declined (-3.4% and -33%, respectively). Age-standardized mortality rates in Italy showed favorable patterns over the last few decades. However, the absolute number of cancer cases and, to a lower extent, of cancer deaths increased likely due to the progressive ageing of the population, this calling for a continuous effort in cancer prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment.","Bosetti, Cristina; Traini, Eugenio; Alam, Tahiya; Allen, Christine A.; Carreras, Giulia; Compton, Kelly; Fitzmaurice, Christina; Force, Lisa M.; Gallus, Silvano; Gorini, Giuseppe; Harvey, James D.; Kocarnik, Jonathan M.; La Vecchia, Carlo; Lugo, Alessandra; Naghavi, Mohsen; Pennini, Alyssa; Piccinelli, Cristiano; Ronfani, Luca; Xu, Rixing; Monasta, Lorenzo",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-79176-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33328623/,587

657346,"Future developments in prevention, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19",2021-03-27,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a rapidly evolving pandemic worldwide with at least 68 million COVID-19-positive cases and a mortality rate of about 2.2%, as of 10 December 2020. About 20% of COVID-19 patients exhibit moderate to severe symptoms. Severe COVID-19 manifests as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with elevated plasma proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin 1β (IL-1β), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10/IP10), macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP-1α), and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), with low levels of interferon type I (IFN-I) in the early stage and elevated levels of IFN-I during the advanced stage of COVID-19. Most of the severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients have had preexisting comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and respiratory diseases. These conditions are known to perturb the levels of cytokines, chemokines, and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), an essential receptor involved in SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cells. ACE2 downregulation during SARS-CoV-2 infection activates the angiotensin II/angiotensin receptor (AT1R)-mediated hypercytokinemia and hyperinflammatory syndrome. However, several SARS-CoV-2 proteins, including open reading frame 3b (ORF3b), ORF6, ORF7, ORF8, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein, can inhibit IFN type I and II (IFN-I and -II) production. Thus, hyperinflammation, in combination with the lack of IFN responses against SARS-CoV-2 early on during infection, makes the patients succumb rapidly to COVID-19. Therefore, therapeutic approaches involving anti-cytokine/anti-cytokine-signaling and IFN therapy would favor the disease prognosis in COVID-19. This review describes critical host and viral factors underpinning the inflammatory “cytokine storm” induction and IFN antagonism during COVID-19 pathogenesis. Therapeutic approaches to reduce hyperinflammation and their limitations are also discussed.","Ramasamy, Santhamani; Subbian, Selvakumar",Clin Microbiol Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33980688/; https://doi.org/10.1128/cmr.00299-20,587

Patients with immune‐mediated disease may be prone to an increased risk of infection and/ or more severe course. We review the available data for patients with psoriatic arthritis (PSA) and systemic treatments. Current treatment options are summarized. Based upon the experience with COVID‐19 the following problems are addressed: (a) Can systemic treatment reduce comorbidities of PsA that are also comorbidities for COVID‐19? Does systemic medical treatment pose an increased risk of infection with SARS‐CoV‐2? Does systemic drug therapy have an impact on the risk of pulmonary fibrosis ‐ a factor with strong negative impact on COVID‐19 outcome? Small molecules, inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor alfa, interleukin and JAK inhibitors are considered. The data are inhomogeneous for the multiple drugs used in PsA. Although the risk for severe upper airway tract infections during clinical controlled trials was mostly in the range of placebo, these data have been obtained before the COVID‐19 pandemic and should be interpreted with caution. Some biologics demonstrated an anti‐fibrotic activity in vitro and in animal disease models. None of the biologics is indicated during an active infection with fever.

To cope with the mask shortage during springtime 2020, a French consortium was created to find ways to reuse medical and respiratory masks in healthcare departments. The consortium addressed the complex context of the balance between cleaning medical masks in a way that maintains their safety and functionality for reuse, with the environmental advantage to manage medical disposable waste despite the current mask designation as single-use by the regulatory frameworks. We report a Workflow that provides a quantitative basis to determine the safety and efficacy of a medical mask that is decontaminated for reuse. The type IIR polypropylene medical masks can be washed up to 10 times, washed 5 times and autoclaved 5 times, or washed then sterilized with radiations or ethylene oxide, without any degradation of their filtration or breathability properties. There is loss of the anti-projection properties. The Workflow rendered the medical masks to comply to the AFNOR S76-001 standard as “type 1 non-sanitory usage masks”. This qualification gives a legal status to the Workflow-treated masks and allows recommendation for the reuse of washed medical masks by the general population, with the significant public health advantage of providing better protection than cloth-tissue masks. Additionally, such a legal status provides a basis to perform a clinical trial to test the masks in real conditions, with full compliance with EN 14683 norm, for collective reuse. The rational reuse of medical mask and their end-of-life management is critical, particularly in pandemic periods when decisive turns can be taken. The reuse of masks in the general population, in industries, or in hospitals (but not for surgery) has significant advantages for the management of waste without degrading the safety of individuals wearing reused masks.","Alcaraz, Jean-Pierre; Le Coq, Laurence; Pourchez, Jérémie; Thomas, Dominique; Chazelet, Sandrine; Boudry, Isabelle; Barbado, Maud; Silvent, Sophie; Dessale, Claire; Antoine, Fabienne; Guimier-Pingault, Catherine; Cortella, Laurent; Rouif, Sophie; Bardin-Monnier, Nathalie; Charvet, Augustin; Dufaud, Olivier; Leclerc, Lara; Montigaud, Yoann; Laurent, Coralie; Verhoeven, Paul; Joubert, Aurélie; Bouhanguel, Ala; Andres, Yves; Gaffé, Joël; Martin, Donald K.; Huet, Christophe; Boisset, Sandrine; Maurin, Max; Rumeau, Pascal; Charlot, Frédéric; Richaud, Emmanuel; Moreau-Gaudry, Alexandre; Bonneterre, Vincent; Cinquin, Philippe; Landelle, Caroline",Chemosphere,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.132364; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34600007/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0045653521028368; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653521028368?v=s5,587
