3411,3411,3411,Prevalence and associated factors of pediatric emergency mortality at Tikur Anbessa specialized tertiary hospital: a 5 year retrospective case review study,17.35768,9.007068,2018-10-02,"BACKGROUND: Childhood mortality remains high in resource-limited third world countries. Most childhood deaths in hospital often occur within the first 24 h of admission. Many of these deaths are from preventable causes. This study aims to describe the patterns of mortality in children presenting to the pediatric emergency department. METHODS: This was a five-year chart review of deaths in pediatric patients aged 7 days to 13 years presenting to the Tikur Anbessa Specialized Tertiary Hospital (TASTH) from January 2012 to December 2016. Data were collected using a pretested, structured checklist, and analyzed using the SPSS Version 20. Multivariate analysis by logistic regression was carried out to estimate any measures of association between variables of interest and the primary outcome of death. RESULTS: The proportion of pediatric emergency department (PED) deaths was 4.1% (499 patients) out of 12,240 PED presentations. This translates to a mortality rate of 8.2 deaths per 1000 patients per year. The three top causes of deaths were pneumonia, congestive heart failure (CHF) and sepsis. Thirty two percent of the deaths occurred within 24 h of presentation with 6.5% of the deaths being neonates and the most common co-morbid illness was malnutrition (41.1%). Multivariate analysis revealed that shortness of breath [AOR=2.45, 95% CI (1.22-4.91)], late onset of signs and symptoms [AOR=3.22, 95% CI (1.34-7.73)], fever [AOR=3.17, 95% CI (1.28-7.86)], and diarrhea [AOR=3.36, 95% CI (1.69-6.67)] had significant association with early mortality. CONCLUSION: The incidence of pediatric emergency mortality was high in our study. A delay in presentation of more than 48 hours, diarrheal diseases and shortness of breath were significantly associated with early pediatric mortality. Early identification and intervention are required to reduce pediatric emergency mortality.","Jofiro, Gemechu; Jemal, Kemal; Beza, Lemlem; Bacha Heye, Tigist",BMC Pediatr,411,1
3812,3812,3812,Association between rs12252 and influenza susceptibility and severity: an updated meta-analysis,17.205597,8.951552,2018-11-13,"In several lately published studies, the association between single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP, rs12252) of IFITM3 and the risk of influenza is inconsistent. To further understand the association between the SNP of IFITM3 and the risk of influenza, we searched related studies in five databases including PubMed published earlier than 9 November 2017. Ten sets of data from nine studies were included and data were analysed by Revman 5.0 and Stata 12.0 in our updated meta-analysis, which represented 1365 patients and 5425 no-influenza controls from four different ethnicities. Here strong association between rs12252 and influenza was found in all four genetic models. The significant differences in the allelic model (C vs. T: odds ratio (OR) = 1.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) (1.03–1.79), P = 0.03) and homozygote model (CC vs. TT: OR = 10.63, 95% CI (3.39–33.33), P < 0.00001) in the Caucasian subgroup were discovered, which is very novel and striking. Also novel discoveries were found in the allelic model (C vs. T: OR = 1.37, 95% CI (1.08–1.73), P = 0.009), dominant model (CC + CT vs. TT: OR = 1.48, 95% CI (1.08–2.02), P = 0.01) and homozygote model (CC vs. TT: OR = 2.84, 95% CI (1.36–5.92), P = 0.005) when we compared patients with mild influenza with healthy individuals. Our meta-analysis suggests that single-nucleotide T to C polymorphism of IFITM3 associated with increasingly risk of severe and mild influenza in both Asian and Caucasian populations.","Chen, T.; Xiao, M.; Yang, J.; Chen, Y.

We present an optimised ex vivo mycobacterial growth inhibition assay (MGIA) to assess the ability of host cells within the lung to inhibit mycobacterial growth, including Bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) Erdman. Growth of BCG was reduced by 0.39, 0.96 and 0.73 log(10) CFU following subcutaneous (s.c.) BCG, intranasal (i.n.) BCG, or BCG s.c. + mucosal boost, respectively, versus naïve mice. Comparatively, a 0.49 (s.c.), 0.60 (i.n.) and 0.81 (s.c. + mucosal boost) log(10) reduction in MTB CFU was found. A BCG growth inhibitor, 2-thiophenecarboxylic acid hydrazide (TCH), was used to prevent quantification of residual BCG from i.n. immunisation and allow accurate MTB quantification. Using TCH, a further 0.58 log(10) reduction in MTB CFU was revealed in the i.n. group. In combination with existing methods, the ex vivo lung MGIA may represent an important tool for analysis of vaccine efficacy and the immune mechanisms associated with vaccination in the organ primarily affected by MTB disease.","Painter, Hannah; Prabowo, Satria A.; Cia, Felipe; Stockdale, Lisa; Tanner, Rachel; Willcocks, Samuel; Reljic, Rajko; Fletcher, Helen A.; Zelmer, Andrea",Sci Rep,411,31

The clinical significance of Mycobacterium monacense is not yet fully understood. Here, we report the first isolation of Mycobacterium monacense from the blood culture of a patient in China with severe pneumonia. CASE PRESENTATION: On June 26, 2018, a 38-year-old man was admitted to the intensive care unit with breathing difficulty. One day prior, he was discovered with his face immersed in a small pond (non-chlorinated water) and with limb convulsions. He had undergone craniocerebral surgery after trauma 5 years earlier, which left him with epilepsy as a sequela. Bilateral diffuse ground-glass opacity was found in the lungs on chest X ray and chest CT image at admission. The result of the HIV serology test of the patient was negative. The patient was diagnosed with severe pneumonia. Drug-susceptible Klebsiella pneumoniae and Candida glabrata were isolated in the BALF, and yellow-pigmented colonies were isolated from blood cultures of the patient. The strain isolated from blood was identified by 16S rDNA sequencing as Mycobacteria monacense, which is a rapidly growing mycobacterium (RGM). The patient was treated with a combination of cefoperazone sulbactam, linezolid and voriconazole for 10 days, and the symptoms improved. During the one-year follow-up time, the patient did not relapse. CONCLUSIONS: We report the first case of M. monacense isolated from blood cultures in a patient with severe pneumonia, which provided evidence that the environmental microorganism possessed pathogenic characteristics.","Yuan, Chenyan; Lu, Huixia; Yang, Congshan; Gao, Wei; Wang, Hailiang; Wu, Guoqiu",BMC Infect Dis,411,2

Nucleic acid amplification tests could assist antibiotic targeting. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, 645 patients presenting to primary care with acute cough and suspected ALRTI, provided throat swabs at baseline. These were tested for respiratory pathogens by real-time polymerase chain reaction and classified as having a respiratory virus, bacteria, both or neither. Three hundred fifty-four participants scored the symptoms severity daily for 1 week in a diary (0 = absent to 4 = severe problem). RESULTS: Organisms were identified in 346/645 (53.6%) participants. There were differences in the prevalence of seven symptoms between the organism groups at baseline. Those with a virus alone, and those with both virus and bacteria, had higher average severity scores of all symptoms combined during the week of follow-up than those in whom no organisms were detected [adjusted mean differences 0.204 (95% confidence interval 0.010 to 0.398) and 0.348 (0.098 to 0.598), respectively]. There were no differences in the duration of symptoms rated as moderate or severe between organism groups. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in presenting symptoms and symptoms severity can be identified between patients with viruses and bacteria identified on throat swabs. The magnitude of these differences is unlikely to influence management. Most patients had mild symptoms at 7 days regardless of aetiology, which could inform patients about likely symptom duration.","Ordóñez-Mena, José M; Fanshawe, Thomas R; Butler, Chris C; Mant, David; Longhurst, Denise; Muir, Peter; Vipond, Barry; Little, Paul; Moore, Michael; Stuart, Beth; Hay, Alastair D; Thornton, Hannah V; Thompson, Matthew J; Smith, Sue; Van den Bruel, Ann; Hardy, Victoria; Cheah, Laikin; Crook, Derrick; Knox, Kyle",Fam Pract,411,17

Chromosome abnormalities involving chromosome 15 were found in 10, entirely normal chromosomes in five and for the remaining four the findings were either equivocal or difficult to interpret. There was no clinical distinction between cases with and without the chromosome anomaly. Examination of three parents and a group of controls showed that the proximal end of the long arm of chromosome 15 may have a considerable degree of normal variation, which can make interpretation difficult. RÉSUMÉ: Chromosome 15 et syndrome de Prader‐ Willi Un caryotype, utilisant les techniques de routine de bandes de Giemsa et de haute résolution, a été pratique chez 19 enfants présentant les caractéristiques cliniques du syndrome de Prader‐Willi. Des anomalies chromosomiques impliquant le chromosome 15 ont été trouvées dans 10 cas, les chromosomes étaient entièrement normaux dans cinq cas, les données étaient équivoques ou difficiles à interpréter dans les quatre cas restants. II n'y avait pas de distinction clinique entre les cas avec ou sans les anomalies chromosomiques.

The genome of birnaviruses encodes the highly immunogenic VP2 capsid protein. In order to demonstrate that the VP2 protein can be exploited as a diagnostic antigen for birnaviruses, we developed a lateral flow assay based on the surface-exposed VP2 protrusion domain of a representative birnavirus, infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) of serotype 1 which causes the highly devastating infectious bursal disease in chickens. The biophysical characterization of the purified domain reveals that the domain predominantly consists of β-sheets, exists in a trimeric form, and remains folded at high temperatures, making it suitable for diagnostic purposes. Owing to its highly immunogenic nature and excellent biophysical properties, we employed the VP2 protrusion domain in a gold nanoparticle-based lateral flow assay for rapid detection of anti-IBDV antibodies in serum samples of infected chickens. Our results indicate that the domain binds anti-IBDV antibodies with high specificity during laboratory testing and on-site testing. The lateral flow assay reported here yields comparable results in a qualitative manner as obtained through a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). As VP2 is a common capsid protein of birnaviruses, the lateral flow assay can be generalized for other birnaviruses, and members of Tetraviridae and Nodaviridae families which contain homologous VP2 capsid proteins.

Electronic health records (EHR), for example, can improve quality of care. Emerging analytics tools based on artificial intelligence show the potential to assist physicians in day-to-day workflows. Yet, single health care providers also need information regarding the economic impact when deciding on potential adoption of these tools. OBJECTIVE: This paper examines the question of whether data and analytics provide economic advantages or disadvantages for health care providers. The goal is to provide a comprehensive overview including a variety of technologies beyond computer-based patient records. Ultimately, findings are also intended to determine whether economic barriers for adoption by providers could exist. METHODS: A systematic literature search of the PubMed and Google Scholar online databases was conducted, following the hermeneutic methodology that encourages iterative search and interpretation cycles. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria to 165 initially identified studies, 50 were included for qualitative synthesis and topic-based clustering. RESULTS: The review identified 5 major technology categories, namely EHRs (n=30), computerized clinical decision support (n=8), advanced analytics (n=5), business analytics (n=5), and telemedicine (n=2). Overall, 62% (31/50) of the reviewed studies indicated a positive economic impact for providers either via direct cost or revenue effects or via indirect efficiency or productivity improvements. When differentiating between categories, however, an ambiguous picture emerged for EHR, whereas analytics technologies like computerized clinical decision support and advanced analytics predominantly showed economic benefits. CONCLUSIONS: The research question of whether data and analytics create economic benefits for health care providers cannot be answered uniformly. The results indicate ambiguous effects for EHRs, here representing data, and mainly positive effects for the significantly less studied analytics field. The mixed results regarding EHRs can create an economic barrier for adoption by providers. This barrier can translate into a bottleneck to positive economic effects of analytics technologies relying on EHR data. Ultimately, more research on economic effects of technologies other than EHRs is needed to generate a more reliable evidence base.","von Wedel, Philip; Hagist, Christian",J Med Internet Res,411,1

We investigated whether maternal race/ethnicity and other sociodemographic factors affect timing of transfer after birth and whether timing of transfer impacts mortality in infants with HLHS. We linked two statewide databases, the California Perinatal Quality Care Collaborative and records from the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development, to identify cases of HLHS born between 1/1/06 and 12/31/11. Cases were divided into three groups: birth at destination hospital, transfer on day of life 0–1 (“early transfer”), or transfer on day of life ≥ 2 (“late transfer”). We used log-binomial regression models to estimate relative risks (RR) for timing of transfer and Cox proportional hazard models to estimate hazard ratios (HR) for mortality. We excluded infants who died within 60 days of life without intervention from the main analyses of timing of transfer, since intervention may not have been planned in these infants. Of 556 cases, 107 died without intervention (19%) and another 52 (9%) died within 28 days. Of the 449 included in analyses of timing of transfer, 28% were born at the destination hospital, 49% were transferred early, and 23% were transferred late. Late transfer was more likely for infants of low birthweight (RR 1.74) and infants born to US-born Hispanic (RR 1.69) and black (RR 2.45) mothers. Low birthweight (HR 1.50), low 5-min Apgar score (HR 4.69), and the presence of other major congenital anomalies (HR 3.41), but not timing of transfer, predicted neonatal mortality. Late transfer was more likely in neonates born to US-born Hispanic and black mothers but was not associated with higher mortality.

Real-world outcomes with use of this system have not yet been comprehensively reported. Methods: Individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) (≥14 years of age) who had ≥21 days of pump usage data were invited via email to participate. Participants completed psychosocial questionnaires (Technology Acceptance Scale [TAS], well-being index [WHO-5], and Diabetes Impact and Devices Satisfaction [DIDS] scale) at timepoint 1 (T1) (at least 3 weeks after starting Control-IQ technology) and the DIDS and WHO-5 at timepoint 2 (T2) (4 weeks from T1). Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and glycemic outcomes were reviewed at each timepoint. Results: Overall, 9,085 potentially eligible individuals received the study invite. Of these, 3,116 consented and subsequently 1,435 participants completed questionnaires at both T1 and T2 and had corresponding glycemic data available on the t:connect(®) web application. Time in range was 78.2% (70.2%–85.1%) at T1 and 79.2% (70.3%–86.2%) at T2. PROs reflected high device-related satisfaction and reduced diabetes impact at T2. Factors contributing to high trust in the system included sensor accuracy, improved diabetes control, reduction in extreme blood glucose levels, and improved sleep quality. In addition, participants reported improved quality of life, ease of use, and efficient connectivity to the continuous glucose monitoring system as being valuable features of the system.

However, whether BALF cellular patterns can predict mortality or not is unknown. We test the hypothesis that BALF cellular patterns have predictive value for mortality in patients with ARF. METHODS: This was a retrospective single-center observational study conducted in a Japanese University Hospital. Consecutive patients (n = 78) with both pulmonary infiltrates and ARF who were examined by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) between April 2015 and May 2018 with at least 1 year of follow-up were analyzed. Primary analysis was receiver operating characteristic curve—area under the curve (ROC-AUC) analysis for 1-year mortality. RESULTS: Among the final sample size of 78 patients, survivors (n = 56) had significantly increased lymphocyte and eosinophil counts and decreased neutrophil counts in BALF compared with non-survivors (n = 22). Among the fractions, lymphocyte count was the most significantly different (30 [12-50] vs. 7.0 [2.9-13]%, P <0.0001). In the ROC curve analysis of the association of BALF lymphocytes with 1-year mortality, the AUC was 0.787 (P <0.0001, cut-off value [Youden index] 19.0%). Furthermore, ≥20% BALF lymphocytes were significantly associated with increased survival with adjustment for baseline imbalances (1-year adjusted hazard ratio, 0.0929; 95% confidence interval, 0.0147–0.323, P <0.0001; 90-day P =0.0012). Increased survival was significantly associated with ≥20% BALF lymphocytes in both interstitial lung disease (ILD) and non-ILD subgroups (P =0.0052 and P =0.0033, respectively). In secondary outcome analysis, patients with ≥20% BALF lymphocytes had significantly increased ventilator-free days, which represents less respiratory dysfunction than those with <20% BALF lymphocytes. CONCLUSIONS: In the patients with ARF, ≥20% lymphocytes in BALF was associated with significantly less ventilatory support, lower mortality at both 90-day and 1-year follow-ups.","Hirasawa, Yasutaka; Nakada, Taka-aki; Shimazui, Takashi; Abe, Mitsuhiro; Isaka, Yuri; Sakayori, Masashi; Suzuki, Kenichi; Yoshioka, Keiichiro; Kawasaki, Takeshi; Terada, Jiro; Tsushima, Kenji; Tatsumi, Koichiro",J Intensive Care,411,1

The effect of physical restraints on outcomes of critically ill adults remains controversial as no randomized controlled trials have compared its safety and efficacy, and the association between physical restraint requirement and neurological outcome in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) has not been fully examined. The aim of this study was to examine the association between physical restraint requirement and neurological outcomes in patients with SAH. METHODS: A single-center, retrospective study was conducted on patients with acute phase SAH treated for > 72 h in the intensive care unit from 2014 to 2020. Patients were divided into three groups based on the amount of time required for physical restraint during the first 24–72 h after admission: no, intermittent, and continuous use of physical restraint. Unfavorable neurologic outcome, assessed using the modified Rankin scale upon hospital discharge, has been considered as primary end point. RESULTS: Overall, 101 patients were included in the study, with 52 patients (51.5%) having unfavorable neurological outcomes. Among them, 46 patients (45.5%) did not use physical restraint, and 55 (54.5%) patients used physical restraint during the first 24–72 h after admission: 26 (25.7%) intermittent and 29 (28.7%) continuous. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that continuous use of physical restraint during the first 24–72 h after admission was significantly associated with unfavorable neurological outcomes in patients with SAH (odds ratio, 3.54; 95% confidence interval, 1.05–13.06; p = 0.042) compared with no physical restraint.

Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) colonization in skin lesions occurs in approximately 70% of AD patients. It has been found that IFN-λ1 can inhibit the colonization of S. aureus in normal human nasal mucosa. IFN-λ1 can increase IL-28RA in infected human keratinocytes. In this study, we found that IFN-λ1 can increase mRNA expression of FLG and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and inhibit TSLP mRNA expression in infected human keratinocytes. IFN-λ1 can increase intracellular ROS level, decrease STAT1 phosphorylation, and inhibit the colonization of S. aureus in human primary keratinocytes. These effects were attenuated by knocking-down IL-28R and NADPH oxidase inhibitor, suggesting that this function was mediated by JAK-STAT1 signaling pathway. These results suggest that IFN-λ1 might have an inhibitory effect on S. aureus colonization in AD lesions. Our findings might have potential value in the treatment for AD.","Wu, Xia; Zhao, Yan; Gu, Ying; Li, Kun; Wang, Xiaojie; Zhang, Jianzhong",Front Pharmacol,411,13

To date, no dynamic indicators of right ventricular preload have been established. The aim of this study was to calculate dynamic indicators of right ventricular preload and assess their ability to predict ventricular volume responsiveness. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was designed as experimental trial in 20 anaesthetized pigs. Micro-tip catheters and ultrasonic flow probes were used as experimental reference to enable measurement of right ventricular stroke volume and pulse pressure. Hypovolemia was induced (withdrawal of blood 20 ml/kg) and thereafter three volume-loading steps were performed. ROC analysis was performed to assess the ability of dynamic right ventricular parameters to predict volume response. RESULTS: ROC analysis revealed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.82 (CI 95% 0.73–0.89; p < 0.001) for right ventricular stroke volume variation (SVV(RV)), an AUC of 0.72 (CI 95% 0.53–0.85; p = 0.02) for pulmonary artery pulse pressure variation (PPV(PA)) and an AUC of 0.66 (CI 95% 0.51–0.79; p = 0.04) for pulmonary artery systolic pressure variation (SPV(PA)). CONCLUSIONS: In our experimental animal setting, calculating dynamic indicators of right ventricular preload is possible and appears promising in predicting volume responsiveness.","Graessler, Michael F.; Wodack, Karin H.; Pinnschmidt, Hans O.; Nishimoto, Sarah; Behem, Christoph R.; Reuter, Daniel A.; Trepte, Constantin J.

We analysed ultrafiltration patterns during night APD following a dry day (APD(DD); no daytime fluid exchange) or wet day (APD(WD); daytime exchange). Ultrafiltration for each APD exchange were recorded for 16 days using RPM in 14 patients. The distributed model of fluid and solute transport was applied to simulate APD and to explore the impact of changes in peritoneal tissue hydration on ultrafiltration. We found lower ultrafiltration (mL, median [first quartile, third quartile]) during first and second vs. consecutive exchanges in APD(DD) (−61 [−148, 27], 170 [78, 228] vs. 213 [126, 275] mL; p < 0.001), but not in APD(WD) (81 [−8, 176], 81 [−4, 192] vs. 115 [4, 219] mL; NS). Simulations in a virtual patient showed that lower ultrafiltration (by 114 mL) was related to increased peritoneal tissue hydration caused by inflow of 187 mL of water during the first APD(DD) exchange. The observed phenomenon of lower ultrafiltration during initial exchanges of dialysis fluid in patients undergoing APD(DD) appears to be due to water inflow into the peritoneal tissue, re-establishing a state of increased hydration typical for peritoneal dialysis.","Stachowska-Pietka, Joanna; Naumnik, Beata; Suchowierska, Ewa; Gomez, Rafael; Waniewski, Jacek; Lindholm, Bengt",Sci Rep,411,31

SICILIAN’s precise splice detection achieves high accuracy on simulated data, improves concordance between matched single-cell and bulk datasets, and increases agreement between biological replicates. SICILIAN detects unannotated splicing in single cells, enabling the discovery of novel splicing regulation through single-cell analysis workflows.

While social innovations for health have shown promise in closing the healthcare delivery gap, more research is needed to evaluate, scale up, and sustain social innovation. Research checklists can standardize and improve reporting of research findings, promote transparency, and increase replicability of study results and findings. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The research checklist was developed through a 3-step community-engaged process, including a global open call for ideas, a scoping review, and a 3-round modified Delphi process. The call for entries solicited checklists and related items and was open between November 27, 2019 and February 1, 2020. In addition to the open call submissions and scoping review findings, a 17-item Social Innovation For Health Research (SIFHR) Checklist was developed based on the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) Checklist. The checklist was then refined during 3 rounds of Delphi surveys conducted between May and June 2020. The resulting checklist will facilitate more complete and transparent reporting, increase end-user engagement, and help assess social innovation projects. A limitation of the open call was requiring internet access, which likely discouraged participation of some subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: The SIFHR Checklist will strengthen the reporting of social innovation for health research studies. More research is needed on social innovation for health.","Kpokiri, Eneyi E.; Chen, Elizabeth; Li, Jingjing; Payne, Sarah; Shrestha, Priyanka; Afsana, Kaosar; Amazigo, Uche; Awor, Phyllis; de Lavison, Jean-Francois; Khan, Saqif; Mier-Alpaño, Jana; Ong, Alberto; Subhedar, Shivani; Wachmuth, Isabelle; Cuervo, Luis Gabriel; Mehta, Kala M.; Halpaap, Beatrice; Tucker, Joseph D.",PLoS Med,411,7

Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) technologies can contribute towards understanding the epidemiology and structural variation landscape of P. falciparum populations, including those within the Lake Victoria basin, a region of intense transmission. Here we provide a baseline assessment of the genomic diversity of P. falciparum isolates in the Lake region of Kenya, which has sparse genetic data. Lake region isolates are placed within the context of African-wide populations using Illumina WGS data and population genomic analyses. Our analysis revealed that P. falciparum isolates from Lake Victoria form a cluster within the East African parasite population. These isolates also appear to have distinct ancestral origins, containing genome-wide signatures from both Central and East African lineages. Known drug resistance biomarkers were observed at similar frequencies to those of East African parasite populations, including the S160N/T mutation in the pfap2mu gene, which has been associated with delayed clearance by artemisinin-based combination therapy. Overall, our work provides a first assessment of P. falciparum genetic diversity within the Lake Victoria basin, a region targeting malaria elimination.","Osborne, Ashley; Manko, Emilia; Takeda, Mika; Kaneko, Akira; Kagaya, Wataru; Chan, Chim; Ngara, Mtakai; Kongere, James; Kita, Kiyoshi; Campino, Susana; Kaneko, Osamu; Gitaka, Jesse; Clark, Taane G.",Sci Rep,411,26

Chloroquine has been proved to have antiviral effect against coronavirus in vitro. In this study, we aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of chloroquine with different doses in COVID-19. METHOD: In this multicenter prospective observational study, we enrolled patients older than 18 years old with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection excluding critical cases from 12 hospitals in Guangdong and Hubei Provinces. Eligible patients received chloroquine phosphate 500 mg, orally, once (half dose) or twice (full dose) daily. Patients treated with non-chloroquine therapy were included as historical controls. The primary endpoint is the time to undetectable viral RNA. Secondary outcomes include the proportion of patients with undetectable viral RNA by day 10 and 14, hospitalization time, duration of fever, and adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 197 patients completed chloroquine treatment, and 176 patients were included as historical controls. The median time to achieve an undetectable viral RNA was shorter in chloroquine than in non-chloroquine (absolute difference in medians -6.0 days; 95% CI -6.0 to -4.0). The duration of fever is shorter in chloroquine (geometric mean ratio 0.6; 95% CI 0.5 to 0.8). No serious adverse events were observed in the chloroquine group. Patients treated with half dose experienced lower rate of adverse events than with full dose. CONCLUSIONS: Although randomised trials are needed for further evaluation, this study provides evidence for safety and efficacy of chloroquine in COVID-19 and suggests that chloroquine can be a cost-effective therapy for combating the COVID-19 pandemic.","Huang, Mingxing; Li, Man; Xiao, Fei; Pang, Pengfei; Liang, Jiabi; Tang, Tiantian; Liu, Shaoxuan; Chen, Binghui; Shu, Jingxian; You, Yingying; Li, Yang; Tang, Meiwen; Zhou, Jianhui; Jiang, Guanmin; Xiang, Jingfen; Hong, Wenxin; He, Songmei; Wang, Zhaoqin; Feng, Jianhua; Lin, Changqing; Ye, Yinong; Wu, Zhilong; Li, Yaocai; Zhong, Bei; Sun, Ruilin; Hong, Zhongsi; Liu, Jing; Chen, Huili; Wang, Xiaohua; Li, Zhonghe; Pei, Duanqing; Tian, Lin; Xia, Jinyu; Jiang, Shanping; Zhong, Nanshan; Shan, Hong",Natl Sci Rev,411,1

In this paper, we analyze the security of FORS with respect to adaptive chosen message attacks. We show that in such a setting, the security of FORS decreases significantly with each signed message when compared to its security against non-adaptive chosen message attacks. We propose a chaining mechanism that with slightly more computation, dynamically binds the Obtain Random Subset (ORS) generation with signing, hence, eliminating the offline advantage of adaptive chosen message adversaries. We apply our chaining mechanism to FORS and present DFORS whose security against adaptive chosen message attacks is equal to the non-adaptive security of FORS. In a nutshell, using SPHINCS[Formula: see text]-128s parameters, FORS provides 75-bit security and DFORS achieves 150-bit security with respect to adaptive chosen message attacks after signing one message. We note that our analysis does not affect the claimed security of SPHINCS[Formula: see text]. Nevertheless, this work provides a better understanding of FORS and other HORS variants, and furnishes a solution if new adaptive cryptanalytic techniques on SPHINCS[Formula: see text] emerge.","Yehia, Mahmoud; AlTawy, Riham; Aaron Gulliver, T.",Progress in Cryptology - AFRICACRYPT 2020,411,21

This study examines the impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic on SCs regarding its disruptions, associated challenges, and trend. It conducts an analysis of SCs stages, phases, and manifestations regarding the consequences, opportunities, and developments induced by the pandemic. A framework for the SC with COVID‐19 is presented towards a future global value chain and continuous improvements. It explores and connects the relevant elements to address the relations of SC‐COVID19 (SCC19). This study is novel as it identifies, categorises, and frames the essential factors and their interrelationships in a comprehensive framework. The SCC19 framework can be of value for decision‐makers and researchers, and can be generalised to other industries. Furthermore, study limitations and future research directions are discussed.","Magableh, Ghazi M.",,411,1

To do so, we used spatial exploratory analysis and spatial econometrics to show that the preponderance of industrial activity in a province has a significant effect on the number of active COVID‐19 cases in that province. On the other hand, we have shown that the spatial diffusion of this effect is not significant, which indicates the appropriateness of the lockdown implemented. We have also shown that age, socio‐economic deficits and habitat conditions are not significant determinants in the onset and spread of the pandemic.","Boumahdi, Ilyes; Zaoujal, Nouzha; Fadlallah, Abdellali",,411,1

PROSPERO: CRD42020190882 METHOD: Both randomised controlled trials and observational studies related to the study were included in this review after a comprehensive search and screening. RESULTS: A total of 2065 potential eligible records were identified. 23 studies were included for quantitative analysis. In meta-analysis, no significant difference was found between the patients who underwent AS/DI and PN/RN for overall survival (OS) (HR 1.36, 95% CI 0.99-1.87, p = 0.06), while cancer-specific survival is significantly worsened (CSS) (HR 1.67, 95% CI 1.23-2.27, p < 0.01) in AS/DI patients. In other localised stages, results are contradicting amongst literature. Upfront TT followed by deferred CN is associated with better OS when compared to upfront CN followed by deferred TT (HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.41-0.69, p = 0.00) in metastatic patients. CONCLUSIONS: Based on low quality evidence, AS and DI is no inferior to immediate surgical intervention in well selected T1a patient’s OS but not CSS. Upfront TT followed by deferred CN improves OS and progression free survival.","Chan, V W S; Ong, W L K; Chiu, P K F; Teoh, J Y C",Br J Surg,411,16

OBJECTIVES: The goal is to examine the impact of COVID-19 disease on children and adults with type 1 diabetes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated the published literature on the risk assessment of COVID-19 in people with type 1 diabetes and the role of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the development of the disease. RESULTS: In adults older than 50 years with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, the risk of severe disease or death from COVID-19 is significantly increased in relation to metabolic control compared with the risks in persons of the same age in the background population. In contrast, severe courses in children with type 1 diabetes have not been described. However, there is an increase of severe illness because of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) during the pandemic, both at manifestation and during the course of the disease. Although in humans SARS-CoV‑2 has been shown to infect islet cells, an association with increased incidence of type 1 diabetes has not been demonstrated epidemiologically to date. CONCLUSIONS: Type 1 and type 2 diabetes in older age is associated with fatal outcomes of COVID-19. Children and youth with diabetes do not have an increased risk for COVID-19 mortality. Special attention has to be given on the prevention of DKA both at type 1 diabetes onset and during long-term care. As in many other areas of health care, the COVID-19 crisis could offer the opportunity to establish a virtual diabetes clinic to complement standard outpatient care.","Danne, Thomas; Kordonouri, Olga",Diabetologe,411,24

COVID-19 can adversely impact food systems and dietary diversity for populations. This cross-sectional study evaluated, using a mobile platform, the effect of COVID-19 on food prices and dietary diversity and quality, among 1797 households in Nouna and Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso), Addis Ababa and Kersa (Ethiopia), and Lagos and Ibadan (Nigeria). METHODS: Dietary intake was assessed as the frequency of consumption of 20 food groups over the previous 7 days. Dietary diversity scores (DDS; range: 0–10) and Prime Diet Quality Score (PDQS; range: 0–40) assessed dietary diversity and quality. Linear regression models were used to evaluate associations between changes in the prices of staples, pulses, vegetables, fruits, and animal source foods (ASF) with DDS and PDQS during COVID-19. RESULTS: Most households reported increases in prices of staples, pulses, fruits, vegetables and ASF, and ≥40% reported decreased consumption of staples, legumes, ASF, other vitamin A rich vegetables, other vegetables and other fruits, and lower DDS and PDQS compared to the period before the COVID-19 emergency. Increases in pulse prices were associated with lower DDS (estimate − 0.35, 95% CI: −0.61, −0.09). Lower crop production (estimate − 0.70, 95% CI: −1.02, −0.37), and skipping meals (estimate − 0.39, 95% CI: −0.56, −0.21) or not eating for a whole day (estimate − 0.23, 95% CI: −0.43, −0.03) were also associated with lower DDS. CONCLUSIONS: The price increases and worsening dietary diversity and quality call for social protection and other strategies to increase the availability and affordability of nutrient-rich foods during the COVID-19 pandemic and other public health emergencies.

Several interventions have been designed to help children to fill this gap. Most of them adopt technological devices (i.e., robots, computers, and avatars) as social mediators and reported evidence of improvement. Few interventions have aimed at promoting emotion recognition and expression abilities and, among these, most have focused on emotion recognition. Moreover, a crucial point is the generalization of the ability acquired during treatment to naturalistic interactions. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of two technological-based interventions focused on the expression of basic emotions comparing a robot-based type of training with a “hybrid” computer-based one. Furthermore, we explored the engagement of the hybrid technological device introduced in the study as an intermediate step to facilitate the generalization of the acquired competencies in naturalistic settings. A two-group pre-post-test design was applied to a sample of 12 children (M = 9.33; ds = 2.19) with autism. The children were included in one of the two groups: group 1 received a robot-based type of training (n = 6); and group 2 received a computer-based type of training (n = 6). Pre- and post-intervention evaluations (i.e., time) of facial expression and production of four basic emotions (happiness, sadness, fear, and anger) were performed. Non-parametric ANOVAs found significant time effects between pre- and post-interventions on the ability to recognize sadness [t((1)) = 7.35, p = 0.006; pre: M (ds) = 4.58 (0.51); post: M (ds) = 5], and to express happiness [t((1)) = 5.72, p = 0.016; pre: M (ds) = 3.25 (1.81); post: M (ds) = 4.25 (1.76)], and sadness [t((1)) = 10.89, p < 0; pre: M (ds) = 1.5 (1.32); post: M (ds) = 3.42 (1.78)]. The group(*)time interactions were significant for fear [t((1)) = 1.019, p = 0.03] and anger expression [t((1)) = 1.039, p = 0.03]. However, Mann–Whitney comparisons did not show significant differences between robot-based and computer-based training. Finally, no difference was found in the levels of engagement comparing the two groups in terms of the number of voice prompts given during interventions. Albeit the results are preliminary and should be interpreted with caution, this study suggests that two types of technology-based training, one mediated via a humanoid robot and the other via a pre-settled video of a peer, perform similarly in promoting facial recognition and expression of basic emotions in children with an ASC. The findings represent the first step to generalize the abilities acquired in a laboratory-trained situation to naturalistic interactions.","Lecciso, Flavia; Levante, Annalisa; Fabio, Rosa Angela; Caprì, Tindara; Leo, Marco; Carcagnì, Pierluigi; Distante, Cosimo; Mazzeo, Pier Luigi; Spagnolo, Paolo; Petrocchi, Serena",Front Psychol,411,30

Although the injury is relatively small, it is still a traumatic operation and also increases the recovery speed of patients. This paper mainly explores the intervention effect of rapid rehabilitation after gynecological laparoscopic surgery by means of WeChat group guidance based on the information adoption model and UTAUT model. Gynecological patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery and met the inclusion and exclusion conditions in a provincial maternal and child health hospital were selected as the research objects. The WeChat intervention group was compared with the nonintervention group, and the oral description score (VRS), comfort score (BCS), and 40-item recovery quality rating scale (QoR-40) were used as the scoring criteria. The results showed that the postoperative VRS and BCS scores in the WeChat intervention group were significantly lower than those in the nonintervention group. The total score of QoR-40 in both groups decreased compared with that before operation, reached the lowest on the first day after operation, and began to rise from the second day. This result is consistent with the patient's postoperative recovery process. After operation, the total score of the WeChat intervention group on days 1 and 2 was higher than that of the non-WeChat intervention group. By comparing the results of the patient's postoperative oral description score (VRS), comfort score (BCS), 40-item recovery quality score scale (QoR-40), etc., it can be shown that the overall recovery quality of the WeChat intervention group was better during these two days. In each section, the oral description score (VRS) and the 40-item recovery quality score scale (QoR-40) indicated that the pain sensation and emotional state scores of patients in the WeChat intervention group were higher than those in the nonintervention group, while the comfort score (BCS) was lower, indicating better comfort in the WeChat intervention group.","Wang, Jing; Lin, Yingying; Wei, Ying; Chen, Xiuying; Wang, Yuping; Zhang, Longxin; Zhou, Min",J Healthc Eng,411,0

The lung ultrasound is a non-invasive and easily repeatable tool and can be carried out by the pediatrician at the bedside of children with a consequent reduction in the risk of transmission of the virus. OBJECTIVE We hypothesized that ultrasound findings in these patients would (1) be associated with their disease severity and (2) change over time in alignment with clinical outcome. METHODS The study was made in the emergency department in a tertiary level pediatric hospital. All patients with swab-confirmed COVID-19 infection were subjected to a lung ultrasound within 6 hours from admission and after 96 hours. RESULTS Among a total of 30 children, 18 (60%) were males, 4 reported exertional dyspnea and only 1 chest pain. The mean oxygen saturation was 98.8 ± 1.0 % in ambient air in emergency department and no patient needed oxygen therapy during hospitalization. Children with moderate disease presented more B line (p= 0.03). After 96 hours we had observed ultrasound abnormality only in 20% of the children. We found a statistically significant reduction in pleural irregularities (30% vs 16.7; p= 0.001) and in B lines (50% vs 20%; p= 0.008).

METHOD Six electronic databases were searched for dystonia and choreoathetosis scales with original psychometric data for children with CP aged 0 to 18 years. RESULTS Thirty-four papers met the inclusion criteria, which contained six scales purported to measure dystonia and/or choreoathetosis in children with CP: the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale; Barry-Albright Dystonia Scale; Unified Dystonia Rating Scale; Movement Disorder-Childhood Rating Scale; Movement Disorder-Childhood Rating Scale 0-3 Years; and the Dyskinesia Impairment Scale. INTERPRETATION Each scale provides useful information about dyskinesia, with most focusing on dystonia. The Barry-Albright Dystonia Scale, which was designed for CP, is the most commonly reported scale and least complex to use clinically. The Dyskinesia Impairment Scale is the only tool to consider both dystonia and choreoathetosis in CP. All tools are designed to classify movement disorders at the level of body functions and structures, rather than activity limitations or participation restrictions, although many provide some insight into the impact of dystonia on activities. Further studies are required to fully examine the validity, reliability, responsiveness, and clinical utility of each scale specifically for children with CP.","Stewart, Kirsty; Harvey, Adrienne; Johnston, Leanne M",Developmental medicine and child neurology,411,28

Scaling of ramp-and-hold dorsiflexion stretch reflexes to stretch velocity and amplitude were examined as indirect measures of changes to muscle spindle dynamic and static function with height-induced postural threat. Overall, stretch reflexes were larger with threat. Furthermore, the slope (gain) of the stretch-velocity vs. short-latency reflex amplitude relationship was increased with threat. These findings are interpreted as indirect evidence for increased muscle spindle dynamic sensitivity, independent of changes in background muscle activity levels, with a threat to standing balance. We argue that context-dependent scaling of stretch reflexes forms part of a multisensory tuning process where acquisition and/or processing of balance-relevant sensory information is continuously primed to facilitate feedback control of standing balance in challenging balance scenarios. ABSTRACT Postural threat increases soleus tendon-tap (t-) reflexes. However, it is not known whether t-reflex changes are a result of central modulation, altered muscle spindle dynamic sensitivity or combined spindle static and dynamic sensitization. Ramp-and-hold dorsiflexion stretches of varying velocities and amplitudes were used to examine velocity- and amplitude-dependent scaling of short- (SLR) and medium-latency (MLR) stretch reflexes as an indirect indicator of spindle sensitivity. t-reflexes were also performed to replicate previous work. In the present study, we examined the effects of postural threat on SLR, MLR and t-reflex amplitude, as well as SLR-stretch velocity scaling. Forty young-healthy adults stood with one foot on a servo-controlled tilting platform and the other on a stable surface. The platform was positioned on a hydraulic lift. Threat was manipulated by having participants stand in low (height 1.1 m; away from edge) then high (height 3.5 m; at the edge) threat conditions. Soleus stretch reflexes were recorded with surface electromyography and SLRs and MLRs were probed with fixed-amplitude variable-velocity stretches. t-reflexes were evoked with Achilles tendon taps using a linear motor. SLR, MLR and t-reflexes were 11%, 9.5% and 16.9% larger, respectively, in the high compared to low threat condition. In 22 out of 40 participants, SLR amplitude was correlated to stretch velocity at both threat levels. In these participants, the gain of the SLR-velocity relationship was increased by 36.1% with high postural threat. These findings provide new supportive evidence for increased muscle spindle dynamic sensitivity with postural threat and provide further support for the context-dependent modulation of human somatosensory pathways.","Horslen, Brian C; Zaback, Martin; Inglis, J Timothy; Blouin, Jean-Sébastien; Carpenter, Mark G",The Journal of physiology,411,1

Both surgical wounds and sphincterial apparatus spasms are likely responsible for the pain. In this study, we evaluated the role of glyceryl trinitrate ointment (GTN) in reducing post-operative pain, ameliorating wound healing and recovery after CH. PATIENTS AND METHODS Between 01/08 and 12/11, 203 patients with symptomatic haemorrhoids were enrolled in the study and received (103 patients) or not (100 patients) 0.4 % GTN ointment for 6 weeks after surgery. Pain was assessed using a 10-cm linear visual analogue scale (VAS). Data on post-operative pain, wound secretion and bleeding, return to normal activities and complications were recorded. Data were analysed using Fisher's exact and Mann-Whitney tests. RESULTS GTN-treated group experienced significantly less pain during the first week after surgery (p < 0.0001). This difference was more evident starting from post-operative day 4 (p < 0.0001). A significant higher percentage of untreated patients experienced severe pain (mean VAS score > 7) (10 % vs 31 %). There were significant differences in terms of secretion time (p = 0.0052) and bleeding time (p = 0.02) in favor of GTN. In addition, the duration of itching was less in the GTN group (p = 0.0145). Patients treated with GTN were able to an early return to daily activities compared to untreated (p < 0.0001). Fifteen GTN-treated patients (14.6 %) discontinued the application because of local discomfort and headache. CONCLUSIONS GTN ointment enhances significantly post-operative recovery, reducing pain in terms of duration and intensity. This effect might be secondary to a faster wound healing expressed by reduced secretion, bleeding and itching time.","Franceschilli, Luana; D'Ugo, Stefano; de Luca, Elisabetta; Cadeddu, Federica; Milito, Giovanni; di Lorenzo, Nicola; Gaspari, Achille L; Sileri, Pierpaolo",International journal of colorectal disease,411,1

The first-line treatment for AIS is mechanical thrombectomy (MT), with or without additional intravenous thrombolysis, while there are different pharmacological, surgical and endovascular treatment options for an acute occlusion of the UL arteries. Here, we describe the practicability, efficacy and safety of neurointerventional devices and techniques for MT of upper extremity arterial occlusions. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected patient databases from four neurovascular centers was performed. Clinical and imaging data, as well as procedural parameters, were assessed. RESULTS Seven out of 6138 patients (incidence: 0.11%) presenting with an AIS due to the occlusion of craniocervical arteries requiring MT and a concomitant occlusion of the brachial (4/7), axillary (2/7), or ulnar (1/7) artery causing acute ULI were identified. Craniocervical MT was technically successful in all cases. Subsequent MT of the upper limb was performed using neurointerventional thrombectomy techniques, most frequently stent retriever thrombectomy (in 4/7 cases) and direct aspiration (in 7/7 cases). MT achieved successful recanalization in 6/7 cases, and the UL completely recovered in all six cases. In one case, recanalization was not successful, and the patient still had a marginally threatened extremity after the procedure, which improved after pharmacological therapy. CONCLUSION In the rare case of AIS requiring MT and concomitant acute upper extremity arterial occlusion, MT of the UL arteries using neurointerventional devices and techniques is practical, effective, and safe.","Vollherbst, Dominik F; Ulfert, Christian; Maus, Volker; Boujan, Timan; Henkes, Hans; Bendszus, Martin; Möhlenbruch, Markus A",Journal of clinical medicine,411,16

RESULTS The two samples had very similar background characteristics, but participants in 2020 were more experienced and their internet use was significantly more diverse and intense than that of their predecessors. The factors predicting technostress in both samples were poorer health, fewer years of use, fewer hours of use per typical week and smaller use repertoire. The technostress level in 2020 was significantly higher than that of 2016-a finding explained by the COVID-19-related HWS. CONCLUSIONS Individual antecedents hardly vary in the presence of significant contextual antecedents, but HWS may leave users with fewer resources to cope with the negative effects of technology use. Future research should explore additional contextual factors and interventions that may alleviate technostress among seniors.","Nimrod, Galit",Aging & mental health,411,1

We previously demonstrated that thermal stimulation applied to the oral cavity provokes an immediate excitability in pharyngeal motor cortex. The aim of the current study was to investigate whether thermal stimulation can produce longer lasting effects on the corticopharyngeal neural pathway. METHODS Healthy volunteers (n = 8/12) underwent baseline pharyngeal motor evoked potential (PMEP) measurements evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation. In the first experiment, subjects received thermal stimulation alternating 30 seconds of 15 and 36°C applied to the tongue surface for either 10 minutes, 5 minutes, or sham. In the second experiment, one of three intermittent thermal stimulus patterns was delivered: cold (alternating 30 seconds of 15 and 36°C), warm (continuous 36°C), or hot (alternating 30 seconds of 45 and 36°C) for 10 minutes. In both experiments, PMEP were remeasured every 15 minutes up to 60 minutes following thermal stimulation. KEY RESULTS Repeated measures ANOVA for each stimulus time in the first experiment showed a significant increased change in PMEP amplitude at 30 minutes following only 10-minute stimulation compared with sham (P < .05). In the second experiment, we found that cold stimulation was more effective than the other stimulation (P < .05) at increasing PMEP amplitudes. CONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES Ten-minute cold stimulation on the tongue can induce a delayed (30 minutes) increase in pharyngeal cortical excitability, providing a clinically useful therapeutic window for its application in dysphagic patients.","Magara, Jin; Watanabe, Masahiro; Tsujimura, Takanori; Hamdy, Shaheen; Inoue, Makoto",Neurogastroenterology and motility : the official journal of the European Gastrointestinal Motility Society,411,1

Spectral reproducibility was assessed for three different cell lines, and the extent of interclass differences and intraclass variance was found to allow the identification of these cell lines based on the REIMS data. Subsequently, the NCI60 cell line panel was subjected to REIMS analysis, and the resulting data set was investigated for its distinction of individual cell lines and different tissue types of origin. Information content of REIMS spectral profiles of cell lines were found to be similar to those obtained from mammalian tissues although pronounced differences in relative lipid intensity were observed. Ultimately, REIMS was shown to detect changes in lipid content of cell lines due to mycoplasma infection. The data show that REIMS is an attractive means to study cell lines involving minimal sample preparation and analysis times in the range of seconds.","Strittmatter, Nicole; Lovrics, Anna; Sessler, Judit; McKenzie, James S; Bodai, Zsolt; Doria, M Luisa; Kucsma, Nora; Szakacs, Gergely; Takats, Zoltan",Analytical chemistry,411,6

Here, we describe a human pilot trial of a soft, smart contact lens for real-time detection of the cortisol concentration in tears using a smartphone. A cortisol sensor formed using a graphene field-effect transistor can measure cortisol concentration with a detection limit of 10 pg/ml, which is low enough to detect the cortisol concentration in human tears. In addition, this soft contact lens only requires the integration of this cortisol sensor with transparent antennas and wireless communication circuits to make a smartphone the only device needed to operate the lens remotely without obstructing the wearer's view.

In this study, we aim to identify patient and treatment-specific factors that may significantly contribute to this phenomenon and translate these characteristics into a predictive model for expected percent free flap volume loss in a given patient. METHODS Patients with a history of oral cavity and/or oropharyngeal cancer who underwent nonosseous free flap reconstruction were reviewed between January 2009 and November 2018 at a tertiary care center. Demographics/characteristics, total radiation dose, radiation fractionation (RF), and pre/postradiation free flap volume as evaluated by computed tomography imaging were collected. Free flap volume was measured by a fellowship-trained neuroradiologist in all cases. Only patients receiving adjuvant radiotherapy with available pre/postradiation imaging were included. Multivariable linear regression modeling for prediction of free flap volume loss was performed with optimization via stepwise elimination. RESULTS Thirty patients were included for analysis. Mean flap volume loss was 42.7% ± 17.4%. The model predicted flap volume loss in a significant fashion (P = .004, R2 = 0.49) with a mean magnitude of error of 9.8% ± 7.5%. Age (β = 0.01, P = .003) and RF (β = -0.01, P = .009) were individual predictors of flap volume loss. CONCLUSIONS Our model predicts percent free flap volume loss in a significant fashion. Age and RF are individual predictors of free flap volume loss, the latter being a novel finding that is also modifiable through hyperfractionation radiotherapy schedules.","Razavi, Christopher R; Hostetter, Jason; Shukla, Aishwarya; Cheng, Zhi; Aygun, Nafi; Boahene, Kofi; Byrne, Patrick J; Richmon, Jeremy; Quon, Harry; Desai, Shaun C","Ear, nose, & throat journal",411,31

Little is known about heritability of functional language lateralization. This report describes heritability estimates using functional language laterality and handedness phenotypes in a twin sample previously reported by Wilson and Bishop (2018). Methods: The total sample consisted of 194 twin pairs (49% monozygotic) aged from 6 to 11 years. A language laterality index was obtained for 141 twin pairs, who completed a protocol where relative blood flow through left and right middle cerebral arteries was measured using functional transcranial Doppler ultrasound (fTCD) while the child described animation sequences. Handedness data was available from the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (EHI) and Quantification of Hand Preference (QHP) for all 194 pairs. Heritability was assessed using conventional structural equation modeling, assuming no effect of shared environment (AE model). Results: For the two handedness measures, heritability estimates (95% CI) were consistent with prior research: .25 (.03 - .34) and .18 (0 - .31) respectively for the EHI and QHP. For the language laterality index, however, the twin-cotwin correlations were close to zero for both MZ and DZ twins, and the heritability estimate was zero (0 - .15). Conclusions: A single study cannot rule out a genetic effect on language lateralisation. It is possible that the low twin-cotwin correlations were affected by noisy data: although the split-half reliability of the fTCD-based laterality index was high (0.85), we did not have information on test-retest reliability in children, which is likely to be lower. We cannot reject the hypothesis that there is low but nonzero heritability for this trait, but our data suggest that individual variation in language lateralisation is predominantly due to stochastic variation in neurodevelopment.","Bishop, Dorothy V M; Bates, Timothy C",Wellcome open research,411,4

We report a series of a new type of dual lumen balloon catheter with a parallel lumen design enabling enhanced inflation and deflation properties through which larger stents may be deployed, including flow diverters (FD). METHODS All aneurysms that were treated with a Copernic 2L (COP2L) dual lumen balloon catheter at our institution between February 2014 and December 2016 were assessed. Patient demographics, aneurysm characteristics, clinical and angiographic follow-up, as well as adverse events were analyzed. RESULTS A total of 18 aneurysms in 16 patients (14 women) were treated with the COP2L. Mean maximal aneurysm diameter was 6.4 mm, mean neck size was 3.3 mm (min 1; max 6.3), and mean aneurysm height/width was 1.1 (min 0.5; max 2.1). The COP2L was used for balloon-remodeled coiling exclusively in 2 aneurysms; coiling and FD stenting in 8; coiling and braided stent delivery in 3; coiling, braided and FD stenting in 1; and FD stenting without coiling in 4 (stenting alone). The rate of Roy-Raymond 1 (complete occlusion) changed from 22% in the immediate postoperative period to 100% at 3 months (mean imaging follow-up 8.2 months). There were three technical complications (3/16, 18.7%), including a perforation and two thromboembolic asymptomatic events that were rapidly controlled with the COP2L. There was no immediate or delayed morbidity or mortality (modified Rankin Scale score 0-1 in 100% of patients). CONCLUSION The COP2L is a new type of dual lumen balloon catheter that may be useful for balloon and/or stent-assisted coiling of cerebral aneurysms. The same device can be used to deliver stents up to 4.5 mm and to optimize stent/wall apposition or serve as a life-saving tool in case of thromboembolic or hemorrhagic events. Long-term efficacy and safety need to be further assessed with larger case-controlled cohorts.","Guenego, Adrien; Zerlauth, Jean-Baptiste; Puccinelli, Francesco; Hajdu, Steven; Rotzinger, David C; Zibold, Felix; Piechowiak, Eike I; Mordasini, Pasquale; Gralla, Jan; Dobrocky, Tomas; Daniel, Roy T; Chapot, René; Mosimann, Pascal J",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,411,16

Despite adequate thromboprophylaxis, one-third of COVID-19 patients with pneumonia developed pulmonary embolism. This high rate of thrombotic complications has led to higher doses of anticoagulants according to clinical complexity (e.g. intensive care unit (ICU) patients) and D-dimer levels. On the other side of the coin, haemorrhagic complications are being increasingly reported. CASES PRESENTATION We herein report four cases of spontaneous psoas haematomas (SPH) among 548 patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia between March 2020 and January 2021 (incidence of 7.3 cases per 1000 patients). All patients had pneumonia, with age ranging between 62 and 83 years. All patients received anticoagulant therapy with low weight molecular heparin (100 U.I. anti-Xa/kg 2 times/d) from admission: in two cases, a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism was made. In another case, a thrombosis of left axillary and basilic veins was found, and only in one case anticoagulant therapy was started because of elevated levels of D-dimer. In all cases, signs of anaemia were detected and patients experienced low back or abdominal pain. The diagnosis of spontaneous psoas haematoma was made by computed tomography (CT) after a median of 12.5 d (9;16) from admission and 19.5 d (14.75; 24.25) from the beginning of COVID-19 symptoms. Half of these patients died from haemorrhagic shock. CONCLUSIONS Given the potential life-threatening of SPH and the possible subtle clinical presentation, we believe it is crucial to raise clinicians awareness of this complication among COVID-19 patients undergoing anticoagulants.","Zerbato, Verena; Bozzato, Alessandro Marco; Di Bella, Stefano; Giuffrè, Mauro; Martingano, Paola; Di Giusto, Anna; Battisti, Sofia; Cova, Maria Assunta; Luzzati, Roberto; Cavallaro, Marco Francesco Maria",Infectious diseases,411,5

Endogenous biomolecule zinc plays a critical role in physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Here, we found that currents recorded from heterologously expressed ASIC1a/3 channels using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique were regulated by zinc with dual effects. Co-application of zinc dose-dependently potentiated both peak amplitude and the sustained component of heteromeric ASIC1a/3 currents; pretreatment with zinc between 3 to 100 µM exerted the same potentiation as co-application. However, pretreatment with zinc induced a significant inhibition of heteromeric ASIC1a/3 channels when zinc concentrations were over 250 µM. The potentiation of heteromeric ASIC1a/3 channels by zinc was pH dependent, as zinc shifted the pH dependence of ASIC1a/3 currents from a pH50 of 6.54 to 6.77; whereas the inhibition of ASIC1a/3 currents by zinc was also pH dependent. Furthermore, we systematically mutated histidine residues in the extracellular domain of ASIC1a or ASIC3 and found that histidine residues 72 and 73 in both ASIC1a and ASIC3, and histidine residue 83 in the ASIC3 were responsible for bidirectional effects on heteromeric ASIC1a/3 channels by zinc. These findings suggest that histidine residues in the extracellular domain of heteromeric ASIC1a/3 channels are critical for zinc-mediated effects.","Jiang, Qian; Peterson, Andrew M; Chu, Yuyang; Yao, Xiaolan; Zha, Xiang-Ming; Chu, Xiang-Ping",Biomolecules,411,1

METHODS A retrospective study was conducted in a maternity unity of a public teaching hospital which was not part of the reference service for COVID-19 treatment. It compared PPEP consumption and the occurrence of SSI after cesarean sections in monthly periods before and after the occurrence of the first case of COVID-19 in Porto Alegre, state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Personal protective equipment and products consumption was measured as units of masks, gloves, gowns, and caps, and use of alcohol-based products or soap for hand sanitation as ml/patient/day. The SSI index was calculated as the proportion of cases of SSI over the number of cesarean sections performed monthly during the study period. RESULTS There was an increase in all measured items of PPEP, with consumption of disposable masks with a median of 1,450 units in the pre-COVID period, and of 2550 in the post-COVID period (a 75.9% increase). A decrease of 49% in SSI was detected, with a median of 1.74 in the pre-COVID period and of 0.89 in the post-COVID period. CONCLUSION The increase in consumption of PPEP could be a result of safer practices adopted by healthcare workers with the advent of COVID-19, of which the following reduction in the occurrence of SSI could be a direct consequence. Despite the severity of the crisis, one could state that extreme situations can lead to valuable reflections and opportunities for improvement.","Antonello, Vicente Sperb; Dallé, Jessica; Antonello, Ivan Carlos Ferreira; Benzano, Daniela; Ramos, Mauro Cunha",Revista brasileira de ginecologia e obstetricia : revista da Federacao Brasileira das Sociedades de Ginecologia e Obstetricia,411,1

There is increasing evidence that CQ not only induces phagocytosis but also regulates vascular tone. However, there are few reports investigating the effect of CQ on vascular responsiveness in coronary artery (CA). In this study, we examined whether and how CQ affected endothelium-dependent relaxation (EDR) in CAs under healthy and diabetic status. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH We isolated CAs from mice and examined endothelium-dependent relaxation (EDR). Human coronary endothelial cells (HCECs) and mouse coronary endothelial cells (MCECs) isolated from control and diabetic mouse [TALLYHO/Jng (TH) mice, a spontaneous type 2 diabetic mouse model] were used for the molecular biological or cytosolic NO and Ca2+ measurements. KEY RESULTS CQ inhibited endothelium-derived NO (EDNO)-dependent relaxation, but had negligible effect on endothelium-derived hyperpolarization (EDH)-dependent relaxation in CAs of control mice. CQ significantly decreased NO production in control HCECs partly by phosphorylating eNOSThr495 (an inhibitory phosphorylation site of eNOS) and attenuating the rise of cytosolic Ca2+ concentration after stimulation. EDR was significantly inhibited in diabetic mice in comparison to control mice. Interestingly, CQ enhanced EDR in diabetic CAs by, specifically, increasing EDH-dependent relaxation due partly to its augmenting effect on gap junction activity in diabetic MCECs. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS These data indicate that CQ affects vascular relaxation differently under healthy and diabetic status. Therefore, the patients' health condition such as coronary macro- or microvascular disease with or without diabetes must be taken account into the consideration of selecting CQ for the treatment of malaria.","Zhang, Qian; Tsuji-Hosokawa, Atsumi; Willson, Conor; Watanabe, Makiko; Si, Rui; Lai, Ning; Wang, Ziyi; Yuan, Jason X-J; Wang, Jian; Makino, Ayako",British journal of pharmacology,411,1

Many countries, including Bangladesh, reported suicide as extreme consequences of the psychological burden influenced by COVID-19. The present study explores human stress and its factor influenced by COVID-19 in Bangladesh, which significantly affect the quality of life. METHODS An online-based questionnaire survey was conducted among 651 adult Bangladeshi populations by capturing socio-demographic information, possible human stress, and consequences of the pandemic. A set of statistical tools such as Pearson's Correlation Matrix (PCM), T-test, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) were applied to identify the relationship between different factors and influential factors increasing human stress. RESULTS More than 83% of the participants are facing COVID-19 related mental stress, which results in short temper, sleep disorder, and family chaos. PCA and HCA outcomes indicated a significant relationship between the respondents' opinions and human stress factors, which harmonized with the country's existing scenario. PCM results enlighten the relationship between human stress factors and found financial hardship, cutting back daily spending, and food crisis are interconnected together causes stress. Also, hampering students' formal education and future career plans significantly contribute to mental stress. CONCLUSION Based on the above findings, it's crucial to introduce a time-oriented strategy and implement precaution monitoring plans for Bangladesh.

METHODS Prospective data were collected between December 2009 and December 2011 for all women undergoing robotic assisted procedures within the gynaecological oncology department. Patient demographics, intra, peri and post-operative data were collected at a single institution, which is a tertiary referral centre for gynaecological oncology and minimal access surgery. RESULTS In total, 104 robotically assisted cases were performed within the gynaecological oncology team. The procedures undertaken included simple and radical hysterectomy, radical trachelectomy, BSO following previous hysterectomy, pelvic and para-aortic node dissection and omentectomy. The mean blood loss was 155.24 mL and the mean hospital stay was 3 days with more than half the women being discharged on day 1 post surgery. CONCLUSIONS These data suggest that robotic assisted surgery is well suited to treating women with principally endometrial and cervical cancers and selected cases of ovarian cancer, enabling surgical staging to be completed with many more patients benefitting from a minimal access surgery approach. Thorough preparation, appropriate case selection and preceptorship in robotic surgery is essential to minimize the associated risks associated with adopting new surgical techniques.","Madhuri, Thumuluru Kavitha; Hamzawala, Imran; Tailor, Anil; Butler-Manuel, Simon",The international journal of medical robotics + computer assisted surgery : MRCAS,411,1

SETTING The Obesity Center Amsterdam, located in a large teaching hospital, in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. METHODS A prospective consecutive database including patients operated between November 2007 and February 2015 was used. For the BASIC, analysis according to the TRIPOD statement was performed to identify risk factors for complications. Class I included patients with zero to one risk factor, class II patients with two risk factors, and class III patients with three or more risk factors. RESULTS Of 1709 analyzed patients, mean age was 45 years (±SD 10.7), 1393 (81.5%) were female; mean body mass index was 44.5 kg/m2 (6.8). Overall, 271 (15.9%) patients developed a complication of which 197 (72.5%) occurred within 30 days.

We present a novel application of the eTEP access technique for the repair of ventral and incisional hernias. METHODS Retrospective review of consecutive laparoscopic retromuscular hernia repair cases utilizing the eTEP access approach from five hernia centers between August 2015 and October 2016 was conducted. Patient demographics, hernia characteristics, operative details, perioperative complications, and quality of life outcomes utilizing the Carolina's Comfort Scale (CCS) were included in our data analysis. RESULTS Seventy-nine patients with mean age of 54.9 years, mean BMI of 31.1 kg/m2, and median ASA of 2.0 were included in this analysis. Thirty-four percent of patients had a prior ventral or incisional hernia repair. Average mesh area of 634.4 cm2 was used for an average defect area of 132.1 cm2. Mean operative time, blood loss, and length of hospital stay were 218.9 min, 52.6 mL, and 1.8 days, respectively. There was one conversion to intraperitoneal mesh placement and one conversion to open retromuscular mesh placement. Postoperative complications consisted of seroma (n = 2) and trocar site dehiscence (n = 1). Comparison of mean pre- and postoperative CCS scores found significant improvements in pain (68%, p < 0.007) and movement limitations (87%, p < 0.004) at 6-month follow-up.

Single-center study of interventional treatment.,17.028511,8.867253,2017,"PURPOSE Since thrombectomy has become a standard treatment technique for stroke, there is great demand for well-trained interventionalists. We offer practical courses on both silicone models and porcine models, and conducted a survey to evaluate whether ex vivo training models could replace in vivo models in the future. METHODS In total, 110 neurointerventionalists participating in 30 training courses were included in our survey using a semi-structured questionnaire. RESULTS The level of experience in thrombectomy maneuvers was almost balanced in our sample (52% experienced and 48% less-experienced participants). Silicone models were regarded as useful training tools regardless of the participants' experience (p = 1.000): 94% of less-experienced and 92% of experienced participants considered a silicone model to be a useful introduction for training with animal models. Of the participants, 95% indicated that training on animal models was helpful and necessary, even if they already had experience in performing interventions in humans (p = 1.000). After joining this course, 97% of all participants felt well prepared to perform thrombectomies in humans. CONCLUSION Even experienced participants benefit from silicone models. Silicone models are a good preparation for animal models but cannot replace them. Categorizing participants depending on their experience and their individual needs before practical training may allow for more efficient endovascular training.","Sandmann, Johanna; Müschenich, Franziska Sonja; Riabikin, Alexander; Kramer, Martin; Wiesmann, Martin; Nikoubashman, Omid","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",411,5

METHODS Umbilical cord and maternal serum IMA concentrations were assessed in term 40 cases with cesarean section (CS) due to FD, 76 cases with elective repeat CS and 85 cases with noncomplicated vaginal delivery. RESULTS The maternal and umbilical cord IMA levels were significantly lower in vaginal deliveries when compared with CS cases either in FD or previous CS groups (p = 0.02). Although no statistically significant difference was found in IMA levels of CS groups (previous CS vs. FD), cord blood IMA levels tend to be higher in FD group. Neither demographic characteristics nor fetal outcome parameters were found to have any correlation with maternal IMA levels. However, umbilical cord IMA levels were found to be negatively correlated with 1th min Apgar scores (r = -0.143, p = 0.043). CONCLUSIONS IMA seems to be responsive to hypoxic FD showing the highest levels in cases with severe fetal hypoxia. Higher levels of IMA in cases with elective repeat CS might indicate acute transient hypoxia and possible myocardial ischemia in these cases.","Caglar, Gamze S; Tasci, Yasemin; Goktolga, Umit; Oztas, Efser; Pabuccu, Recai; Ozdemir, Elif D; Seker, Rabia","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",411,27

METHODS In a prospective cross-sectional comparative pilot study, we recruited patients with resolved endophthalmitis in one eye (study eye) and a normal fellow eye (control eye). Collected data included measurement of the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging and AO-SLO imaging and cone counting at the fovea in both eyes. RESULTS The study included 12 eyes of 6 patients. The mean age was 51.66±11.97 years (median 56 years). BCVA in all control eyes was 20/20 (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (LogMAR) 0), and in the study, eyes was 0.21±0.13 (median 0.19, Snellen 20/30; p=0.001; 95% CI -0.39 to -0.09). The follow-up was 18.66±12.32 (median 20 months). The cone count at the fovea in the control eye was 4356.33±1993.93 (median 4498), and in the study eye, it was 2357.16±1541.17 (median 2187.5; p=0.03; 95% CI -3556 to -1082). CONCLUSIONS Eyes with resolved endophthalmitis with near-normal vision have reduced number of foveal cones even in absence of OCT-detected gross structural changes. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE The current work describes the application of cellular-level imaging technique called adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (AO-SLO) to the clinical condition of resolved endophthalmitis. The study of retinal cell biology at the cellular level is possible using the emerging technology of AO-SLO. This new investigative modality that has the potential to image the retina at the cellular level until the photoreceptors is more likely to unravel the pathophysiology of a variety of retinal diseases.","Dave, Vivek Pravin; Kumar, Sanjay; Mulani, Yasmeen; Richhariya, Ashutosh; Pappuru, Rajeev Reddy; Das, Taraprasad",The British journal of ophthalmology,411,1

Eight ADCs are currently approved by FDA for clinical applications, with more novel ADCs under clinical development. Compared with traditional chemotherapy, ADCs combine the target specificity of antibodies with chemotherapeutic capabilities of cytotoxic drugs. The benefits include reduced systemic toxicity and enhanced therapeutic index for patients. However, the heterogeneous structures of ADCs and their dynamic changes following administration create challenges in their development. The understanding of ADC pharmacokinetics (PK) is crucial for the optimization of clinical dosing regimens when translating from animal to human. In addition, it contributes to the optimization of dose selection and clinical monitoring with regard to safety and efficacy. This manuscript reviews the PK characteristics of ADCs and summarizes the diverse approaches for PK modeling that can be used to evaluate an ADC at the preclinical and clinical stages to support their successful development. Despite the numerous available options, fit-for-purpose modeling approaches for the PK and PD of ADCs should be critically planned and well-thought-out to adequately support the development of an ADC.","Zuo, Peiying",The AAPS journal,411,28

METHODS Patients with PE and confirmed aetiology who underwent diagnostic thoracentesis were included in this study. One retrospective set (N = 1261) was used to develop and internally validate the predictive model. The clinical, radiological and laboratory features were collected and subjected to logistic regression analyses. The primary predictive model was displayed as a nomogram and then modified into a novel scoring system, which was externally validated in an independent set (N = 172). FINDINGS The novel scoring system was composed of fever (3 points), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (4 points), effusion adenosine deaminase (7 points), serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (4 points), effusion CEA (10 points) and effusion/serum CEA (8 points). With a cutoff value of 15 points, the area under the curve, specificity and sensitivity for identifying MPE were 0.913, 89.10%, and 82.63%, respectively, in the training set, 0.922, 93.48%, 81.51%, respectively, in the internal validation set and 0.912, 87.61%, 81.36%, respectively, in the external validation set. Moreover, this scoring system was exclusively applied to distinguish lung cancer with PE from tuberculous pleurisy and showed a favourable diagnostic performance in the training and validation sets. INTERPRETATION This novel scoring system was developed from a retrospective study and externally validated in an independent set based on six easily accessible clinical variables, and it exhibited good diagnostic performance for identifying MPE.

This paper describes the characteristics of postal codes reported by the Canadian population on the census and, as an indicator of geocoding accuracy, the proportion that are linked to a single dissemination area (DA). DATA AND METHODS Postal codes reported on the 2016 Census questionnaire were matched to a combination of the Postal Code Conversion File (PCCF) and the Postal Code Conversion File Plus (PCCF+ version 7B) (reference date November 2018) to calculate population-weighted counts and the number of matches to DAs by province or territory, delivery mode type (DMT), population centre or rural area size, and census metropolitan area. The number of single matches to census tracts (CTs), census subdivisions (CSDs) and census divisions (CDs) was also calculated. RESULTS In Canada, 72.6% of the population reported postal codes that matched to a single DA. This proportion was higher in urban cores (87.1%) and among postal codes for an urban street address (DMT=A) (85.3%) or apartment building (DMT=B) (95.3%), and was lower in rural areas (26.2% to 38.1%) and among rural postal codes (13.9%). In comparison, 89.3% and 95.4% of the population reported postal codes matching to a single CSD or CD, respectively, while 92.1% of the population that live within CT boundaries were matched to a single CT. DISCUSSION Matching postal codes to census geography is relatively accurate and frequently one to one in urban centres. In rural areas and for some types of postal code DMTs, alternative approaches to using the PCCF and PCCF+ for attaching census geography might be explored.","Pinault, Lauren; Khan, Saeeda; Tjepkema, Michael",Health reports,411,1

Some of these viruses are potential gene transfer vectors for gene therapy. However no study has been reported on total codon usage of herpesvirus. In this study, the patterns of synonymous codon usage in herpesviruses have been studied through multivariate statistical methods on 4875 ORFs from the available 49 completely sequenced herpesvirus genomes. A general trend of weakly biased codon usage was observed among herpesviruses, but few among them showed some degree of strong bias. The principal determinants behind such notable variations within the patterns seemed to be the overall GC content and GC content at the 3rd base position of the viral genes. These determinants strongly correlated with the first major axis of correspondence analysis on relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU). This is an indication of mutational bias that dominates over translational selection in herpesvirus. Among the other determining factors, gene length also has some degree of influence on the codon usage pattern. The comparative analysis of the preferred and optimal codons among the clades revealed that different codons were preferred in different clades, though six codons CUG, CAC, CAG, AAC, GUG, and GAC were found to be more frequent in most of the herpesviral genes. Codon adaptation index (CAI) was used to predict highly expressed genes among herpesviruses, and to identify translationally optimal codons. Cluster analysis reveals that the majority of the members of a clade have similar codon usage and nucleotide composition, but with some notable exception. Additionally phylogenetic analysis indicates that codon usage of the viruses cannot be explicitly tied to their species evolution.","Roychoudhury, Sourav; Mukherjee, Debaprasad",Virus research,411,30

Retrospective series have reported benefits of VATS when compared with open thoracotomy in terms of postoperative pain, postoperative complications and length of hospital stay. However, no large randomised control trial has been conducted to assess the reality of the potential benefits of VATS lobectomy or its medicoeconomic impact. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The French National Institute of Health funded Lungsco01 to determine whether VATS for lobectomy is superior to open thoracotomy for the treatment of NSCLC in terms of economic cost to society. This trial will also include an analysis of postoperative outcomes, the length of hospital stay, the quality of life, long-term survival and locoregional recurrence. The study design is a two-arm parallel randomised controlled trial comparing VATS lobectomy with lobectomy using thoracotomy for the treatment of NSCLC. Patients will be eligible if they have proven or suspected lung cancer which could be treated by lobectomy. Patients will be randomised via an independent service. All patients will be monitored according to standard thoracic surgical practices.

Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in 15 villages less than 10 km from a border. A questionnaire was developed and tested for reliability and validity; 48 questions covered participant characteristics, plus knowledge about, attitudes to and preparedness for COVID-19. Chi-squared tests were used to detect any significant association between variables. Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to assess the possible association of various factors with participants' level of reported knowledge, attitudes and preparedness. Results A total of 520 participants were recruited of whom 320 (61.5%) were women. The age range was 18-90 years; the average age was 45.2 years. Variables with an association with good to moderate preparedness for COVID-19 prevention and control that remained after adjustment were: women were better prepared than men (adjusted odds ratio (ORadj) = 2.52; 95% CI = 1.36-4.68); those aged 18-30 years (ORadj = 4.26; 95% CI = 1.18-15.30), 31-45 years (ORadj = 4.60; 95% CI = 1.59-13.32) or 46-60 years (ORadj = 2.69; 95% CI = 1.16-6.26) were better prepared than those aged 60-90 years; and, compared with those with no formal education, those educated to primary school level (ORadj = 2.43; 95% CI = 1.09-5.43) or to university level (ORadj = 3.18; 95% CI = 1.06-9.51) were better prepared.

Both ground state and excited state absorptions are analyzed and compared between these different theoretical approaches, assessing the performance of the hybrid B3LYP and CAM-B3LYP (long-range corrected) functionals with respect to the RASPT2 reference. By comparing the TD-DFT estimates with our reference for high-lying excited states, we are able to narrow down specific energetic windows where TD-DFT may be safely employed to qualitatively reproduce the excited state absorption (ESA) signals registered in non-linear and time-resolved spectroscopy for monitoring photoinduced phenomena. Our results show a qualitative agreement between the RASPT2 reference and the B3LYP computed ESAs of pyrimidines in the near-IR/Visible spectral probing window while for purines the agreement is limited to the near-IR ESAs, with generally larger discrepancies obtained with the CAM-B3LYP functional.

Herein we aimed to compare the technical feasibility and efficacy of EBL and endoclip use in intraluminal closure of colon perforation, in an ex vivo model. METHODS Standardized colonic perforations were created using fresh porcine colon and subsequently closed by full-thickness interrupted sutures, endoclip (QuickClip2(TM)), or EBL. Each closure site was tested with compressed air by using a digital pressure monitor for evaluating leak pressure. RESULTS No significant differences were noted between the endoclip and EBL in leak pressures. Mean (± SD) pressures for air leakage from the perforations closed using the different devices were as follows: normal colon samples, 52.0 ± 13.2 mmHg; perforations closed with hand-sewn sutures, 32.3 ± 8.3 mmHg; perforations closed with endoclipping, 53.5 ± 22.7 mmHg; and perforations closed with EBL, 50.4 ± 12.5 mmHg. Time taken for closure by EBL was significantly less than that for closure by endoclipping (3.2 ± 1.7 min vs 6.8 ± 1.3 min, P < 0.01). Further, the number of devices used to achieve complete closure in the EBL group was lower than that with endoclipping (1.6 ± 0.5 vs 3.7 ± 0.8, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION Endoluminal closure of a 1.5-cm colon perforation with EBL decreased procedure time and was not inferior in leak pressure compared with endoclipping in this ex vivo porcine model.","Lee, Tae Hoon; Han, Joung-Ho; Jung, Yunho; Lee, Suck-Ho; Kim, Dae Hoon; Shin, Ji Yun; Lee, Tae Soo; Kim, Myunghwan; Choi, Seok-Hwa; Kim, Hyun; Park, Seonmee; Youn, Seijin",Digestive endoscopy : official journal of the Japan Gastroenterological Endoscopy Society,411,33

The use of routine intraoperative cholangiography (IOC) is widely practiced during conventional four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy (4PLC) to confirm biliary anatomy and allow for immediate management of unexpected choledocholithiasis. Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) offers a more aesthetic technique for gallbladder removal and has been reported by several groups. However, no series to date have included routine IOC without a separate incision. This study aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of the SILS technique for cholecystectomy with routine IOC (LCIOC) and common bile duct (CBD) exploration as needed via the umbilical port. METHODS A database was prospectively completed for a series of 60 consecutive patients undergoing single-incision LCIOC via the umbilical port. Details of the patients, operations, indications, outcomes, and follow-up evaluation were included. RESULTS Of the 60 patients included in the database, 55 (91.7%) successfully underwent single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC), whereas the remaining five patients required conversion to 4PLC. No patient required conversion to open cholecystectomy (OC). Of the 55 successful SILC patients, 53 (88.3%) successfully received IOCs, 48 of which were normal. The remaining five IOCs demonstrated choledocholithiasis, four of which could be managed laparoscopically without the need for conversion to either 4PLC or OC. One patient required postoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Complications included four wound infections (7.8%), one incisional hernia (2.0%), and one bile leak (3.2%). The operating time ranged from 35 to 180 min and decreased with experience.

We now investigate its potential effects on the brain versus the semirecumbent position. We studied 17 anesthetized pigs and randomized to be ventilated and positioned as follows: duty cycle (TI/TTOT) of 0.33, without positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), placed with the bed oriented 30° in anti-Trendelenburg (control group); positioned as in the control group, with TI/TTOT adjusted to achieve an expiratory flow bias, PEEP of 5 cm H2O (IRV-PEEP); positioned in 5° TP and ventilated as in the control group (TP). Animals were challenged into the oropharynx with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We assessed hemodynamic parameters and systemic inflammation throughout the study. After 72 h, we evaluated incidence of microbiological/histological VAP and brain injury. Petechial hemorrhages score was greater in the TP group (P = 0.013). Analysis of the dentate gyrus showed higher cell apoptosis and deteriorating neurons in TP animals (P < 0.05 vs. the other groups). No differences in systemic inflammation were found among groups. Cerebral perfusion pressure was higher in TP animals (P < 0.001), mainly driven by higher mean arterial pressure. Microbiological/histological VAP developed in 0%, 67%, and 86% of the animals in the TP, control, and IRV-PEEP groups, respectively (P = 0.003). In conclusion, the TP prevents VAP; yet, we found deleterious neural effects in the dentate gyrus, likely associated with cerebrovascular modification in such position. Further laboratory and clinical studies are mandatory to appraise potential neurological risks associated with long-term TP.","López-Aguilar, Josefina; Bassi, Gianluigi Li; Quílez, María Elisa; Martí, Joan Daniel; Ranzani, Otavio T; Xiol, Eli Aguilera; Rigol, Montserrat; Luque, Nestor; Guillamat, Raquel; Ferrer, Isidre; Torres, Antoni; Blanch, Lluís",Shock,411,33

This protocol reports a methodology for a systematic review and meta-analysis that aims to systematically review the published literature and quantify the level of environmental contamination of healthcare settings with cytotoxic drugs. METHODS This protocol is developed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocol-2015 (PRISMA-P) guidelines. Six electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, and EMBASE) will be searched with no restrictions on publication period. Eligible studies will be identified and data will be extracted using a predefined data extraction form by at least two independent reviewers following best practice. Eligible studies should report calculated or calculable estimates on the proportion of positive samples tested for cytotoxic drugs and/or estimates on the concentration of the cytotoxic drug(s) in the tested samples. Risk of bias (RoB) will be assessed by using the RoB in Studies estimating Prevalence of Exposure to Occupational risk factors (RoB-SPEO) tool, which developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) and International Labour Organization (ILO) for environmental and occupational health systematic reviews. The random-effects model will be used to perform meta-analyses. DISCUSSION Occupational exposure to cytotoxic drugs is associated with short- and long-term adverse health outcomes. Following this protocol, the review to be carried out will be the first to fill an evidence gap on the environmental contamination of healthcare settings with cytotoxic drugs. The findings of this review will help in the understanding of the risk of occupational exposure of healthcare workers to cytotoxic drugs and facilitate the identification of priority areas for specific interventions. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The systematic review methodology does not require ethics approval due to the nature of the study design. The results of the systematic review will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and will be publicly available.

This report provides insight into the longer term durability and safety with 12-month data. MATERIALS AND METHODS Aneurysms treated with the PulseRider among enrolled sites were prospectively studied. Updated 12-month data on clinical and imaging end points are included. RESULTS Thirty-four patients were enrolled (29 women, 5 men) with a mean age of 60.9 years. The mean aneurysm height ranged from 2.4 to 15.9 mm with a mean neck size of 5.2 mm (range, 2.3-11.6 mm). At 1 year, there were no device migrations or symptomatic in-stent stenoses. Raymond-Roy I occlusion was achieved in 53% of cases at the time of treatment and progressed to 61% and 67% at 6 and 12 months, respectively. Adequate occlusion (Raymond-Roy I/II) progressed from 88% at 6 months to 90% at 12 months. No recanalizations were observed. There was 1 delayed ischemic event. Good outcome (mRS 0-2) was achieved in 90% of patients. CONCLUSIONS The updated 1-year results from the ANSWER trial demonstrate aneurysm stability and an acceptable safety profile for aneurysms treated at the basilar apex and carotid terminus. Prospective data from a larger set of aneurysms treated at other locations are required to assess how treatment with PulseRider compares with alternatives for treating wide-neck bifurcation aneurysms.","Spiotta, A M; Chaudry, M I; Turner, R D; Turk, A S; Derdeyn, C P; Mocco, J; Tateshima, S",AJNR.

Apart from attacking respiratory system, it can induce multiorgan dysfunction, including cardiovascular system, liver, kidney, gastrointestinal, nervous system and immune system. However, there are few reviews focusing on summary and comparison of diagnostic methods and complications induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection, which places a significant limit on the effective management. AREAS COVERED This review is a blend of evidence obtained by literature retrieval from PubMed, clinical experience and the authors' opinions. We searched PubMed using the terms ""COVID-19 & diagnosis"" and ""COVID-19 & complications"" and selected the most relevant articles. Here we summarize the diagnostic methods that are available in clinic and discuss their different characters. Furthermore, the review offers an insight into the symptoms, incidences and clinical strategies of complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. EXPERT OPINION COVID-19 has been a global pandemic, which requires rapid response. The comparison between different characters of the diagnostic methods and the summary of the symptoms, incidence and clinical strategies of complications given in this review are not only significant for the optimal use of diagnostic methods, but also beneficial for the prevention and management of complications.","Ai, Leilei; Jiang, Liyu; Xu, Zhifei; Yan, Hao; Luo, Peihua; He, Qiaojun",Expert review of clinical pharmacology,411,24

However, a mounting body of evidence suggests that at physiological doses, bilirubin is a powerful antioxidant and anti-atherosclerotic agent. Recent clinical studies have shown that human beings with genetically-induced hyperbilirubinemia (Gilbert Syndrome) are protected against coronary heart disease. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether administration of exogenous bilirubin to normal rats would convey similar protective effects in an experimental model of coronary ischemia. We hypothesized that intraperitoneal bilirubin administration 1 h before injury would decrease infarct area and preserve left ventricular (LV) systolic function when compared to non-treated rats. Coronary ischemia was induced by temporary (30 min) ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery in control or bilirubin treated rats, followed by a 1-h period of reperfusion. LV function was estimated by measurements of fractional shortening (FS) and fractional area shortening using echocardiography. LV function decreased in both experimental groups after ischemia and reperfusion, although in bilirubin-treated rats FS was less depressed during the period of ischemia (18.8 vs. 25.8%, p = 0.034). Infarct size was significantly reduced in the bilirubin treated group compared to the non-treated group (13.34 vs. 25.5%, p = 0.0067). Based on the results of this study, bilirubin supplementation appears to provide significant decrease in infarct size although protective effects on LV function were noted only during the period of ischemia. This result also suggests that lipid soluble antioxidant bilirubin prevents the oxidation of cardiolipin and decreases the infarct size in the heart during ischemia.","Ben-Amotz, Ron; Bonagura, John; Velayutham, Murugesan; Hamlin, Robert; Burns, Patrick; Adin, Christopher",Frontiers in physiology,411,12

In particular, evolutionary and developmental robotics and the evo-devo models can simulate the simultaneous adaptation effects of the phylogenetic and ontogenetic development of the embodied mind in response to the characteristics of the environment. The simulation using Artificial Intelligence and robotics could contribute significantly to the definition, experimentation, and validation of the models that make up the theories of psychology in its different domains, enhancing the interdisciplinarity with other sciences that study the same objects.

Male-only lifestyle interventions have shown promise for improving men's physical health, but the overall impact of these programs on psychological outcomes is unclear. This review aimed to evaluate the impact of male-only lifestyle interventions on men's mental health and to identify if any study or intervention features were associated with effectiveness. A systematic literature search with no date restrictions was conducted across four databases and returned 15 946 citations. Nine studies were eligible for inclusion, representing 1427 participants. Risk of bias was generally low across studies, although none were specifically powered to detect changes in mental health. Overall, significant group-by-time effects were reported for 26% of mental health outcomes examined. In the fixed-effects meta-analyses, small-to-medium intervention effects were observed for mental health-related quality of life (SMD = 0.24), self-esteem (SMD = 0.51), and positive affect (SMD = 0.58). Insights into effective study or intervention features were limited because of the low number of heterogeneous studies. Although male-only lifestyle interventions have improved men's mental health in some circumstances, studies that are specifically powered to detect long-term changes are urgently required, particularly in groups with pre-existing mental health concerns.","Drew, Ryan J; Morgan, Philip J; Pollock, Emma R; Young, Myles D",Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,411,19

Spectroscopic methods, XRD, TGA, 1H NMR, GPC and morphology analyses were utilized to characterize the structural properties of the BCT-g-inulin complex, and our results confirmed the conjugation of BCT and inulin. The conjugation possibly occurred between the hydroxyl group attached at the C6 position of inulin and the C6/C8 position of flavon-3-ol units of BCT. The grafting ratio and grafting efficiency of the BCT-g-inulin complex were 357.54 ± 2.98 g kg-1 complex and 74.57 ± 1.44%, respectively. The data of the antioxidant assays indicated that the BCT-g-inulin complex showed a significantly higher antioxidant activity than native inulin. Also, the grafting reaction remarkably improved the in vitro anti-diabetic activity of inulin. The glucose adsorption capacity and glucose dialysis retardation index of the BCT-g-inulin complex were remarkably higher than those of inulin, while the BCT-g-inulin complex showed much stronger inhibitory effects against α-amylase and α-glucosidase compared with inulin. Notably, the inhibition of both α-amylase and α-glucosidase by the BCT-g-inulin complex occurred through mixed-competitive mode. On the basis of fluorescence spectroscopy, the fluorescence of α-amylase and α-glucosidase could be quenched by the BCT-g-inulin complex through a static quenching mechanism. Hence, the BCT-g-inulin complex might have the potential to be developed as an effective anti-diabetic agent.","Zeng, Xiangquan; Du, Zhenjiao; Ding, Xiaomeng; Zhao, Yunshu; Jiang, Weibo",Food & function,411,1

In this study, we examined whether CypI and NS5Ai interfere with hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA synthesis of replication complexes (RCs) or with an earlier step of HCV RNA replication, the creation of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) essential for HCV RNA replication. In contrast to NS5Bi, both CypI and NS5Ai do not block HCV RNA synthesis by way of RCs, suggesting that they exert their antiviral activity prior to the establishment of enzymatically active RCs. We found that viral replication is not a precondition for DMV formation, since the NS3-NS5B polyprotein or NS5A suffices to create DMVs. Importantly, only CypI and NS5Ai, but not NS5Bi, mir-122, or phosphatidylinositol-4 kinase IIIα (PI4KIIIα) inhibitors, prevent NS3-NS5B-mediated DMV formation. NS3-NS5B was unable to create DMVs in cyclophilin A (CypA) knockdown (KD) cells. We also found that the isomerase activity of CypA is absolutely required for DMV formation. This not only suggests that NS5A and CypA act in concert to build membranous viral factories but that CypI and NS5Ai mediate their early anti-HCV effects by preventing the formation of organelles, where HCV replication is normally initiated. This is the first investigation to examine the effect of a large panel of anti-HCV agents on DMV formation, and the results reveal that CypI and NS5Ai act at the same membranous web biogenesis step of HCV RNA replication, thus indicating a new therapeutic target of chronic hepatitis C.","Chatterji, Udayan; Bobardt, Michael; Tai, Andrew; Wood, Malcolm; Gallay, Philippe A",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,411,17

DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, Embase, LILACS, and Medline databases and scientific meeting abstracts to July 2016. REVIEW METHODS Randomized controlled trials of alpha blockers compared with placebo or control for treatment of ureteric stones were eligible. : Two team members independently extracted data from each included study. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who passed their stone. Secondary outcomes were the time to passage; the number of pain episodes; and the proportions of patients who underwent surgery, required admission to hospital, and experienced an adverse event. Pooled risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for the primary outcome with profile likelihood random effects models. Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias and the GRADE approach were used to evaluate the quality of evidence and summarize conclusions. RESULTS 55 randomized controlled trials were included. There was moderate quality evidence that alpha blockers facilitate passage of ureteric stones (risk ratio 1.49, 95% confidence interval 1.39 to 1.61). Based on a priori subgroup analysis, there seemed to be no benefit to treatment with alpha blocker among patients with smaller ureteric stones (1.19, 1.00 to 1.48). Patients with larger stones treated with an alpha blocker, however, had a 57% higher risk of stone passage compared with controls (1.57, 1.17 to 2.27). The effect of alpha blockers was independent of stone location (1.48 (1.05 to 2.10) for upper or middle stones; 1.49 (1.38 to 1.63) for lower stones). Compared with controls, patients who received alpha blockers had significantly shorter times to stone passage (mean difference -3.79 days, -4.45 to -3.14; moderate quality evidence), fewer episodes of pain (-0.74 episodes, -1.28 to -0.21; low quality evidence), lower risks of surgical intervention (risk ratio 0.44, 0.37 to 0.52; moderate quality evidence), and lower risks of admission to hospital (0.37, 0.22 to 0.64; moderate quality evidence). The risk of a serious adverse event was similar between treatment and control groups (1.49, 0.24 to 9.35; low quality evidence). CONCLUSIONS Alpha blockers seem efficacious in the treatment of patients with ureteric stones who are amenable to conservative management. The greatest benefit might be among those with larger stones. These results support current guideline recommendations advocating a role for alpha blockers in patients with ureteric stones.

The seven disease groups for which the data were analyzed were as follows: those (i) without any diseases; (ii) with hypertension only; (iii) with albuminuria only; (iv) with anemia only; (v) with diabetes only; (vi) with hypertension and one or more of diabetes, anemia, and albuminuria; and (vii) with two or more of diabetes, anemia, and albuminuria without hypertension. For almost every PFAA, for all seven disease groups except the albuminuria only group, hyperfiltrators had lower adjusted geometric means (AGM) than normal filtrators. For example, for the disease group with hypertension only, for PFOS, the AGMs for hyperfiltrators and normal filtrators were 8.3 and 10.6 ng/mL, respectively, for the total population. For the group with albuminuria only, normal filtrators were found to have higher AGMs than hyperfiltrators for the total population and males. For example, for PFHxS, the AGMs for normal and hyperfiltrators were 0.98 and 1.05 ng/mL, respectively, for the total population. For females, these AGMs for normal and hyperfiltrators were 0.96 and 0.86 ng/mL respectively. Males usually had higher AGMs than females, but the reverse was also true occasionally. Usually, male-female differences were substantially narrower for normal filtrators than hyperfiltrators. Irrespective of the filtration status, the disease group with hypertension only had the highest AGMs for every PFAA. AGMs for the anemia only group were the lowest for every PFAA as compared with other disease groups among hyperfiltrators.","Jain, Ram B",Environmental science and pollution research international,411,26

Examine the trends of RRs over time and how they vary with study type, questionnaire format, and the use of reminders. DESIGN Literature review with systematic search. DATA SOURCES PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, kvalitetsregistre.no, kvalitetsregister.se and sundhed.dk. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Articles in all areas of medical research using registry-based data or cohort design with at least two follow-up time points collecting PROMs and reporting RRs. Annual reports of registries including PROMs that report RRs for at least two time points. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE RRs to PROMs. RESULTS A total of 10 articles, 12 registry reports and 6 registry articles were included in the review. The overall RR at baseline was 75%±22.1 but decreased over time. Cohort studies had a markedly better RR (baseline 97%±4.7) compared with registry-based data at all time points (baseline 72%±21.8). For questionnaire formats, paper had the highest RR at 86%±19.4, a mix of electronic and paper had the second highest at 71%±15.1 and the electronic-only format had a substantially lower RR at 42%±8.7. Sending one reminder (82%±16.5) or more than one reminder (76%±20.9) to non-responders resulted in a higher RR than sending no reminders (39%±6.7). CONCLUSIONS The large variation and downward trend of RRs to PROMs in cohort and registry-based studies are of concern and should be assessed and addressed when using registry data in both research and clinical practice.","Wang, Katherine; Eftang, Cathrine N; Jakobsen, Rune Bruhn; Årøen, Asbjørn",BMJ open,411,24

All data were collected by telephone questionnaires and were utilized for analyzing the potential factors of willingness to be vaccinated through descriptive analysis and logistic regression analysis. Of the 2,802 respondents, 2,284 (81.5%) said they would agree to receive the vaccine against COVID-19. People who earned high incomes, who carefully followed media news on COVID-19 vaccine, who looked forward to successful vaccine research, and who closely followed vaccine protective efficacy expressed more interest in being vaccinated than other people did. In addition, people who paid attention to protective efficacy of vaccine, vaccine price, and expert opinion were more likely to accept COVID-19 vaccination than people who focused on vaccine safety. When vaccine price was ≥201 RMB, people were less likely to accept vaccination than ≤200 RMB. 1,842 respondents (65.7%) wished that government could provide COVID-19 vaccination for free. This study suggests that the government should increase vaccination compliance by strengthening publicity efforts and decreasing vaccine price.","Yang, Feng; Li, Xiaofan; Su, Xiaoting; Xiao, Tingting; Wang, Yang; Hu, Ping; Li, Han; Guan, Jing; Tian, Haizhen; Wang, Peng; Wang, Wencheng",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,411,17

The incidence of enteric infections caused by these eight pathogens reported by FoodNet sites in 2019 continued to increase or remained unchanged, indicating progress in controlling major foodborne pathogens in the United States has stalled. Campylobacter and Salmonella caused the largest proportion of illnesses; trends in incidence varied by Salmonella serotype. Widespread adoption of whole genome sequencing (WGS) of bacteria has improved the ability to identify outbreaks, emerging strains, and sources of pathogens. To maximize the potential of WGS to link illnesses to particular sources, testing of isolates by clinical and public health laboratories is needed. Reductions in Salmonella serotype Typhimurium suggest that targeted interventions (e.g., vaccinating chickens and other food animals) might decrease human infections. Reducing contamination during food production, processing, and preparation will require more widespread implementation of known prevention measures and of new strategies that target particular pathogens and serotypes.","Tack, Danielle M; Ray, Logan; Griffin, Patricia M; Cieslak, Paul R; Dunn, John; Rissman, Tamara; Jervis, Rachel; Lathrop, Sarah; Muse, Alison; Duwell, Monique; Smith, Kirk; Tobin-D'Angelo, Melissa; Vugia, Duc J; Zablotsky Kufel, Joanna; Wolpert, Beverly J; Tauxe, Robert; Payne, Daniel C",MMWR.

PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients undergoing PD who were followed up during the NCP epidemic by our hospital were enrolled in this study. Because of the need to control the epidemic, a follow-up system was established during the epidemic period, with WeChat, QQ, and the telephone as the main methods of communication. Outpatient and emergency follow-ups were carried out to ensure the safety of dialysis and the prevention and control of the epidemic. The follow-up strategy included response measures related to the epidemic situation, prevention of peritonitis related to PD, water and salt control, exercise guidance, and psychological care. According to the patient's condition, the appointment system was implemented, with one consulting room and one process for each patient. The emergency patients were isolated in accordance with the epidemic situation. RESULTS Since January 2020, among the 580 patients undergoing PD who were followed up in our department and their families, none had NCP infection. During the epidemic period, the standard hemoglobin level and the inpatient rate decreased. Complications related to PD, such as peritonitis, cardiovascular complications caused by volume overload, and pulmonary infection, did not significantly increase, and the withdrawal rate and mortality rate decreased compared with those in the same period last year. CONCLUSIONS The patient follow-up strategy during the epidemic period had a significant positive effect on preventing and controlling the epidemic. Furthermore, during the epidemic period, encouraging patients and caregivers to pay attention to protection at home, avoid going out, strengthen self-management, and other measures were beneficial to the control of kidney disease itself, which is worth promoting. The close relationship between doctors and patients during the epidemic had a positive effect on the occurrence of complications related to patients undergoing PD.","Wang, Y; Wang, Y-C; Song, S-H; Zhang, H-X; Wang, L; Ma, X-Q; Zhao, C-P; Xu, M; Tian, N; Chen, M-H",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,411,16

METHODS This is a cross-sectional observational study of IAD patients and COVID-19 with controls matched for age, sex, and RT-PCR. A control group was used to compare the cumulative incidence (CI) and case fatality rate (CFR). The main outcomes of the study were CI and CFR. Other variables included comorbidities, treatments, and characteristics of the COVID-19. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate risk factors for fatality in patients with IAD. RESULTS Of the 1537 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria, 23/1537 (1.49 %) had IAD 13(0.8%) had rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 5 psoriatic arthritis (PsA) (0.3%) and 5 axial spondyloarthritis (SPA) (0.3%). There were no significant differences in CI of COVID-19 and CFR in patients with IAD compared to COVID-19 patients without IAD. In RT-PCR positive patients the CI of COVID-19 in PsA and AS was higher. Of the 23 IAD patients, 2 RA patients (8.6%) died. The patients not showed characteristics of the COVID-19 disease different from population. In multivariate analysis, the factor associated with fatality in patients with IAD was older age (OR [95%CI], 1.1 [1.0-1.2]). CONCLUSION COVID-19 CI, fatality rate and other features do not seem to be increased in IAD patients.

Despite their growing presence, they have largely been left out of HF research and interventions. This systematic review was aimed to 1) describe utilization patterns of HCWs by adults with HF, 2) examine the effect of HCWs on HF outcomes, and 3) review HF interventions that involve HCWs. Methods Five electronic databases (Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, Cochrane Library [Wiley], CINAHL [EBSCO], and AgeLine [EBSCO]) were searched from inception through August 4, 2017. The yield was screened using prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two authors independently reviewed references and a third reviewer acted as an arbitrator when needed. Data were extracted from articles that met the inclusion criteria. The Downs and Black checklist was used for quality assessment. Due to study heterogeneity, a narrative synthesis was conducted. Results Of the 7,032 studies screened, 13 underwent full-text review, and six met the inclusion criteria. Two descriptive studies found that adults with HF who live alone and have functional and cognitive deficits utilize HCWs. While three retrospective cohort studies examined the association between having an HCW post-HF hospitalization and readmission rates, their findings were conflicting. One quasi-experimental study found that an HCW-delivered educational intervention improved HF patients' self-care abilities. Overall, despite some significant findings, the studies assessed were of poor-to-fair quality (Downs and Black score range: 10-16 [28 total points]), with most lacking methodological rigor. Conclusion Although HCWs are quite common, the literature on these paraprofessionals in HF is limited. Given the paucity of research in this area and the low quality of studies reviewed here, additional research is warranted on the potential role of HCWs in HF self-care and on outcomes among adults with HF.","Sterling, Madeline R; Shaw, Amy L; Leung, Peggy Bk; Safford, Monika M; Jones, Christine D; Tsui, Emma K; Delgado, Diana",Journal of multidisciplinary healthcare,411,1

They can cause persistent or asymptomatic infections, but also acute disease associated with a respiratory syndrome, abortion or lethal haemorrhagic fever. During the past two decades, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and, to a lesser extent, equine arteritis virus (EAV) have attracted attention as veterinary pathogens with significant economic impact. Particularly noteworthy were the 'porcine high fever disease' outbreaks in South-East Asia and the emergence of new virulent PRRSV strains in the USA. Recently, the family was expanded with several previously unknown arteriviruses isolated from different African monkey species. At the molecular level, arteriviruses share an intriguing but distant evolutionary relationship with coronaviruses and other members of the order Nidovirales. Nevertheless, several of their characteristics are unique, including virion composition and structure, and the conservation of only a subset of the replicase domains encountered in nidoviruses with larger genomes. During the past 15 years, the advent of reverse genetics systems for EAV and PRRSV has changed and accelerated the structure-function analysis of arterivirus RNA and protein sequences. These systems now also facilitate studies into host immune responses and arterivirus immune evasion and pathogenesis. In this review, we have summarized recent advances in the areas of arterivirus genome expression, RNA and protein functions, virion architecture, virus-host interactions, immunity, and pathogenesis. We have also briefly reviewed the impact of these advances on disease management, the engineering of novel candidate live vaccines and the diagnosis of arterivirus infection.","Snijder, Eric J; Kikkert, Marjolein; Fang, Ying",The Journal of general virology,411,31

A 70-yr-old woman with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, and previous strokes presented with recurrent transient ischemic attacks of the left upper and lower extremities over the last 6 mo. She underwent right cervical endarterectomy (CEA) 16 yr prior. Neurological examination was unremarkable. Carotid Doppler ultrasonography revealed severely increased velocities of the right ICA. Cervical magnetic resonance angiography demonstrated 80% right ICA stenosis and 50% BTO stenosis. Digital subtraction cerebral angiography showed 80% right ICA stenosis and 70% BTO stenosis. The patient was not a candidate for standard carotid artery stenting because the BTO precluded endovascular access or for CEA because of the previous CEA; therefore, direct carotid access and flow reversal was an alternative. Under general anesthesia and systemic heparinization, the patient underwent right carotid artery surgical exposure. Under flow reversal using the Enroute System (Silk Road Medical, Sunnyvale, California), anterograde right ICA stenting angioplasty and retrograde BTO stenting and angioplasty were performed. Successful revascularization of the right ICA and BTO was obtained. No procedure-related complications occurred. The patient was discharged home 2 d postprocedure, neurologically intact. Direct carotid access with flow reversal is a safe and effective therapeutic alternative for patients with ICA (or common carotid artery) stenosis who cannot undergo CEA or when endovascular access from the aortic arch is not possible.

The small CoV envelope (E) protein plays roles in assembly, virion release, and pathogenesis. CoV E has a single hydrophobic domain (HD), is targeted to Golgi complex membranes, and has cation channel activity in vitro. However, the precise functions of the CoV E protein during infection are still enigmatic. Structural data for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV E protein suggest that it assembles into a homopentamer. Specific residues in the HD regulate the ion-conducting pore formed by SARS-CoV E in artificial bilayers and the pathogenicity of the virus during infection. The E protein from the avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) has dramatic effects on the secretory system which require residues in the HD. Here, we use the known structural data from SARS-CoV E to infer the residues important for ion channel activity and the oligomerization of IBV E. We present biochemical data for the formation of two distinct oligomeric pools of IBV E in transfected and infected cells and the residues required for their formation. A high-order oligomer of IBV E is required for the production of virus-like particles (VLPs), implicating this form of the protein in virion assembly. Additionally, disruption of the secretory pathway by IBV E correlates with a form that is likely monomeric, suggesting that the effects on the secretory pathway are independent of E ion channel activity. IMPORTANCE CoVs are important human pathogens with significant zoonotic potential, as demonstrated by the emergence of SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV. Progress has been made toward identifying potential vaccine candidates in mouse models of CoV infection, including the use of attenuated viruses that lack the CoV E protein or express E-protein mutants. However, no approved vaccines or antiviral therapeutics exist. We previously reported that the hydrophobic domain of the IBV E protein, a putative viroporin, causes disruption of the mammalian secretory pathway when exogenously expressed in cells. Understanding the mechanism of this disruption could lead to the identification of novel antiviral therapeutics. Here, we present biochemical evidence for two distinct oligomeric forms of IBV E, one essential for assembly and the other with a role in disruption of the secretory pathway. Discovery of two forms of CoV E protein will provide additional targets for antiviral therapeutics.","Westerbeck, Jason W; Machamer, Carolyn E",Journal of virology,411,20

MicroRNAs are stable biomarkers that can be detected in extracellular fluids. This systematic scoping review aims to describe published research on urinary and circulating microRNAs in toxic acute kidney injury in both animal and human studies. We conducted a literature search, using EMBASE and Medline, for articles on urinary and circulating microRNA in nephrotoxic injuries to February 2020. A total of 21 publications studied acute kidney injury from 12 different toxic agents. Cisplatin was the most common nephrotoxic agent (n = 10), followed by antibiotics (n = 4). There were no randomized controlled trials. An increase in urinary miR-218 predicted acute kidney injury in six different studies, suggesting it is a promising biomarker for nephrotoxin-induced acute kidney injury. There were many factors that prevented a more comprehensive synthesis of microRNA performance including highly variable models, no consistent protocols for RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis and PCR amplification, and variability in normalization methods using reference controls. In conclusion, while microRNAs are promising biomarkers to study nephrotoxic acute kidney injury, the replication of most positive findings is not assessable due to deficient reporting of negative outcomes. A very narrow range of poisons have been studied, and more human data are required. In particular, further studies are needed on the most important causes of nephrotoxic injury, such as pesticides, chemicals, snake envenoming, and medicines other than aminoglycosides and cisplatin.","Shihana, Fathima; Barron, Melissa L; Mohamed, Fahim; Seth, Devanshi; Buckley, Nicholas A",Pharmacology research & perspectives,411,27

MODIS satellite images are used together with gridded weather data to model biometeorological parameters at the Fruit Circuit region, state of São Paulo, Southeast Brazil. This region has experienced some cases of drought, while arising rainfall water excess in some periods, demanding large-scale water and energy balance studies to subsidize water resource policies.

The highest latent heat fluxes (λE), above 8.0 MJ m-2 d-1, at the end of the year, coincide with the progressive increases on both rainfall and global solar radiation (RG) levels, and drop to below 5.0 MJ m-2 d-1 in the middle of the year, during the driest conditions. The same tendencies along the year are verified for sensible heat fluxes (H), for which mean pixel values are above 3.5 MJ m-2 d-1 at the end of the year. On the one hand, the highest values for water productivity (WP), which is considered the ratio of actual evapotranspiration (ET) to biomass production (BIO), above 4.0 kg m-3, are verified in April, period under increasing BIO and low ET rates. On the other hand, the lowest WP values (below 2.0 kg m-3) occur between August and October, when BIO is low, and ET is high. Although the area featuring good WP levels under high precipitation (P), with rainfalls generally above ET, supplementary irrigation may benefit agriculture in some periods of the year. The results of the large-scale modeling showed applicability of the models for monitoring water and vegetation dynamics over 16-day timescale and at a 250-m spatial resolution in areas experiencing climate and land-use changes by combining climate data and MODIS images. Application of these tools enables to indicate the best options for expanding the agriculture activities, being of great potential for rational natural resources management, in regions under environmental vulnerability conditions.","de Castro Teixeira, Antônio Heriberto; Leivas, Janice Freitas; Garçon, Edlene Aparecida Monteiro; Takemura, Celina Maki; Quartaroli, Carlos Fernando; Alvarez, Ivan André",International journal of biometeorology,411,31

We aimed to establish a surgical technique of allogeneic UTx assuming the recovery of a uterus from a deceased donor in cynomolgus macaques. Four allogeneic UTxs were performed in female cynomolgus macaques. Donor surgeries comprised en bloc recovery of organs with iliac vessels on both sides, and/or abdominal aorta/vena cava after sufficient perfusion from one femoral artery or external iliac artery. Before perfusion, 150 mL of whole blood was obtained from the donor for subsequent blood transfusion to the recipient. Four uterine grafts were orthotopically transplanted to recipients. End-to-side anastomosis was performed to the iliac vessels on one side in case 1 and iliac vessels on both sides in case 2; aorto-aorto/cavo-caval anastomosis was performed in cases 3 and 4. Arterial blood flow of the uterine grafts was determined by intraoperative indocyanine green (ICG) angiography. ICG angiography results showed sufficient blood flow to all uterine grafts, and anaemia did not progress. Under appropriate immune suppression, all recipients survived for more than 90 days post-transplantation, without any surgical complications.

OBJECTIVE To review the chemistry, pharmacology, toxicology and efficacy of thiazolides as antiviral agents with emphasis on clinical development of nitazoxanide in treating chronic hepatitis C. METHODS Literature search, information from Romark Laboratories and my personal experience with the discovery and development of thiazolides serve as the sources for this review. CONCLUSIONS Thiazolides are metabolically stable, highly bound to plasma proteins and are associated with a favorable toxicology profile. Phase II clinical trials have demonstrated efficacy and safety of nitazoxanide added to peginterferon with or without ribavirin in treating patients with chronic hepatitis C. More limited clinical data indicated potential in treating chronic hepatitis B, and three randomized controlled trials have demonstrated efficacy in reducing the duration of viral gastroenteritis. New generation thiazolides with the nitro group of nitazoxanide replaced by a non-reducible group are not active against anaerobes but retain broad-spectrum activity against viruses. Further studies are needed. Research indicates that these drugs may play an important and complementary role in combination with other classes of antiviral drugs.","Rossignol, Jean-François",Expert opinion on drug metabolism & toxicology,411,1

Lifestyle changes towards a healthy diet, increased physical activity and reduced sedentary activities are recommended to prevent and treat obesity. Evidence suggests that changing these health behaviours can benefit cognitive function and school achievement in children and adolescents in general. There are various theoretical mechanisms that suggest that children and adolescents with excessive body fat may benefit particularly from these interventions. OBJECTIVES To assess whether lifestyle interventions (in the areas of diet, physical activity, sedentary behaviour and behavioural therapy) improve school achievement, cognitive function (e.g. executive functions) and/or future success in children and adolescents with obesity or overweight, compared with standard care, waiting-list control, no treatment, or an attention placebo control group. SEARCH METHODS In February 2017, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and 15 other databases. We also searched two trials registries, reference lists, and handsearched one journal from inception. We also contacted researchers in the field to obtain unpublished data. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of behavioural interventions for weight management in children and adolescents with obesity or overweight. We excluded studies in children and adolescents with medical conditions known to affect weight status, school achievement and cognitive function. We also excluded self- and parent-reported outcomes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Four review authors independently selected studies for inclusion. Two review authors extracted data, assessed quality and risks of bias, and evaluated the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We contacted study authors to obtain additional information. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Where the same outcome was assessed across different intervention types, we reported standardised effect sizes for findings from single-study and multiple-study analyses to allow comparison of intervention effects across intervention types. To ease interpretation of the effect size, we also reported the mean difference of effect sizes for single-study outcomes. MAIN RESULTS We included 18 studies (59 records) of 2384 children and adolescents with obesity or overweight. Eight studies delivered physical activity interventions, seven studies combined physical activity programmes with healthy lifestyle education, and three studies delivered dietary interventions. We included five RCTs and 13 cluster-RCTs. The studies took place in 10 different countries. Two were carried out in children attending preschool, 11 were conducted in primary/elementary school-aged children, four studies were aimed at adolescents attending secondary/high school and one study included primary/elementary and secondary/high school-aged children. The number of studies included for each outcome was low, with up to only three studies per outcome. The quality of evidence ranged from high to very low and 17 studies had a high risk of bias for at least one item. None of the studies reported data on additional educational support needs and adverse events.Compared to standard practice, analyses of physical activity-only interventions suggested high-quality evidence for improved mean cognitive executive function scores. The mean difference (MD) was 5.00 scale points higher in an after-school exercise group compared to standard practice (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68 to 9.32; scale mean 100, standard deviation 15; 116 children, 1 study). There was no statistically significant beneficial effect in favour of the intervention for mathematics, reading, or inhibition control. The standardised mean difference (SMD) for mathematics was 0.49 (95% CI -0.04 to 1.01; 2 studies, 255 children, moderate-quality evidence) and for reading was 0.10 (95% CI -0.30 to 0.49; 2 studies, 308 children, moderate-quality evidence). The MD for inhibition control was -1.55 scale points (95% CI -5.85 to 2.75; scale range 0 to 100; SMD -0.15, 95% CI -0.58 to 0.28; 1 study, 84 children, very low-quality evidence). No data were available for average achievement across subjects taught at school.There was no evidence of a beneficial effect of physical activity interventions combined with healthy lifestyle education on average achievement across subjects taught at school, mathematics achievement, reading achievement or inhibition control. The MD for average achievement across subjects taught at school was 6.37 points lower in the intervention group compared to standard practice (95% CI -36.83 to 24.09; scale mean 500, scale SD 70; SMD -0.18, 95% CI -0.93 to 0.58; 1 study, 31 children, low-quality evidence). The effect estimate for mathematics achievement was SMD 0.02 (95% CI -0.19 to 0.22; 3 studies, 384 children, very low-quality evidence), for reading achievement SMD 0.00 (95% CI -0.24 to 0.24; 2 studies, 284 children, low-quality evidence), and for inhibition control SMD -0.67 (95% CI -1.50 to 0.16; 2 studies, 110 children, very low-quality evidence). No data were available for the effect of combined physical activity and healthy lifestyle education on cognitive executive functions.There was a moderate difference in the average achievement across subjects taught at school favouring interventions targeting the improvement of the school food environment compared to standard practice in adolescents with obesity (SMD 0.46, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.66; 2 studies, 382 adolescents, low-quality evidence), but not with overweight. Replacing packed school lunch with a nutrient-rich diet in addition to nutrition education did not improve mathematics (MD -2.18, 95% CI -5.83 to 1.47; scale range 0 to 69; SMD -0.26, 95% CI -0.72 to 0.20; 1 study, 76 children, low-quality evidence) and reading achievement (MD 1.17, 95% CI -4.40 to 6.73; scale range 0 to 108; SMD 0.13, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.61; 1 study, 67 children, low-quality evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Despite the large number of childhood and adolescent obesity treatment trials, we were only able to partially assess the impact of obesity treatment interventions on school achievement and cognitive abilities. School and community-based physical activity interventions as part of an obesity prevention or treatment programme can benefit executive functions of children with obesity or overweight specifically. Similarly, school-based dietary interventions may benefit general school achievement in children with obesity. These findings might assist health and education practitioners to make decisions related to promoting physical activity and healthy eating in schools. Future obesity treatment and prevention studies in clinical, school and community settings should consider assessing academic and cognitive as well as physical outcomes.","Martin, Anne; Booth, Josephine N; Laird, Yvonne; Sproule, John; Reilly, John J; Saunders, David H",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,411,16

However, none have investigated the accuracy of virtual material compared to skeletal remains in nonmetric variant analysis using 3D models. The present study investigates the accuracy of 20 computed tomography (CT) 3D reconstruction models compared to the real crania, focusing on the quality of the reproduction of the real crania and the possibility to detect 29 dental/cranial morphological variations in 3D images. An interobserver analysis was performed to evaluate trait identification, number, position, and shape. Results demonstrate a false bone loss in 3D models in some cranial regions, specifically the maxillary and occipital bones in 85% and 20% of the samples. Additional analyses revealed several difficulties in the detection of cranial nonmetric traits in 3D models, resulting in incorrect identification in circa 70% of the traits. In particular, pitfalls included the detection of erroneous position, error in presence/absence rates, in number, and in shape. The lowest percentages of correct evaluations were found in traits localized in the lateral side of the cranium and for the infraorbital suture, mastoid foramen, and crenulation. The present study highlights important pitfalls in CT scan when compared with the real crania for nonmetric analysis. This may have crucial consequences in cases where 3D databanks are used as a source of reference population data for nonmetric traits and pathologies and during bone-CT comparisons for identification purposes.","Bertoglio, Barbara; Corradin, Sofia; Cappella, Annalisa; Mazzarelli, Debora; Biehler-Gomez, Lucie; Messina, Carmelo; Pozzi, Grazia; Sconfienza, Luca Maria; Sardanelli, Francesco; Sforza, Chiarella; De Angelis, Danilo; Cattaneo, Cristina",Journal of forensic sciences,411,24

In this commentary, we argue that actions on health equity to date have been insufficient despite significant scholarship to guide both practice and policy. To move from talk to action on health equity, we propose the following five approaches: (1) reversing the erosion of publicly funded health systems; (2) creating broad economic means to support health; (3) moving health action upstream; (4) challenging ageist and/or ableist discourses; and (5) decolonizing approaches and enacting solidarity. Engaging in these actions will help close the gaps and address disparities made more evident during this global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic reinforces the need for us to move from discussion to action if we are to achieve health for all. Adopting a health equity lens is a means of both understanding and stimulating action to readdress the root causes of inequities and work toward a fairer, more just society.","Caxaj, Susana; Oudshoorn, Abe; Ford-Gilboe, Marilyn; Webster, Fiona; Donelle, Lorie; Forchuk, Cheryl; Berman, Helene; Smye, Vicki",Nursing leadership,411,12

The goal of this study was to retroactively apply the CHEER system to all prior existing reports of endoscopic resection of primary benign orbital tumors (BOTs) to: (1) compare patient presentations, perioperative characteristics, and outcomes between OCH and other BOTs; and (2) determine whether the CHEER categorization regime could be expanded to other BOTs. METHODS A systematic review of studies reporting exclusively endoscopic resections of OCH and other BOTs (eg, solitary fibrous tumor, schwannoma, and meningioma) was performed. Patient, tumor characteristics, and operative outcomes were recorded. All tumors with adequate reporting were retrospectively assigned a CHEER stage. Outcomes were compared using chi-square or Fisher's exact tests. RESULTS Ninety-three studies met inclusion criteria, and sufficient data were available in 36 studies, comprising 105 tumors (n = 87 OCHs; n = 18 other BOTs). Baseline patient and tumor characteristics, as well as intraoperative and short-term postoperative outcomes were not significantly different between OCHs and other BOTs. Long-term outcomes (eg, visual deficits, diplopia, eye position, and recurrence) also did not differ when controlling for CHEER stage. CONCLUSION This review represents the largest collection of outcomes data following exclusively endoscopic endonasal resection of BOTs. Short-term and long-term outcomes appear similar between OCHs and other BOTs. These results suggest that exclusively endoscopic resection of orbital tumors may be effective in a range of benign pathologies. Furthermore, these results support a broader application of the CHEER system to other benign primary orbital tumors.","Jafari, Aria; von Sneidern, Manuela; Lehmann, Ashton E; Shen, Sarek A; Shishido, Sachie; Freitag, Suzanne K; Bleier, Benjamin S",International forum of allergy & rhinology,411,7

This is an ecological time series study with secondary data obtained from the Bi Saúde Portal in the panel on Interpersonal Violence and Suicide. The study collected reports on violence in individuals 0 to 19 years of age in the months of March and April each year, stratified by sex, age bracket, race/color, and type of violence. Prais-Winsten regression was used to analyze the time trend. Of the 7,718 reports analyzed, there was a drop of 54% in the year 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. The analysis of the trend until 2019 indicated an increase in the reporting rates (2.04, 95%CI: 1.01; 3.07, p = 0.002), but with the inclusion of the year 2020 in the time series, the direction of the trends in reporting rates was reversed to negative, losing statistical significance (-0.39, 95%CI: -1.16; 2.14, p = 0.632). The study concludes that social distancing due to the pandemic reduced the reporting rates of violence against children and adolescents due to underreporting, thus requiring strategies to improve the identification of suspected cases of violence during the pandemic. This highlights the need for inter-sector planning and rapid and specific actions (health, social protection, justice, and public security) in order to guarantee the rights of children and adolescents.","Levandowski, Mateus Luz; Stahnke, Douglas Nunes; Munhoz, Tiago N; Hohendorff, Jean Von; Salvador-Silva, Roberta",Cadernos de saude publica,411,31

This study aims to investigate whether intravenous alteplase is of potential benefit in reducing PE after successful MT. METHODS Patients from a prospective study treated at a tertiary care stroke center between 08/2017 and 12/2019 were analyzed. The main inclusion criterion was successful reperfusion after MT (defined as expanded thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (eTICI) scale ≥ 2b50) of large vessel occlusion anterior circulation stroke. All patients received a high-resolution diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) follow-up 24 h after MT for PE detection. Patients were grouped as ""direct MT"" (no alteplase) or as MT plus additional intravenous alteplase. The number and volume of ischemic core lesions and PE were then quantified and analyzed. RESULTS Fifty-six patients were prospectively enrolled. Additional intravenous alteplase was administered in 46.3% (26/56). There were no statistically significant differences of PE compared by groups of direct MT and additional intravenous alteplase administration regarding mean numbers (12.1, 95% CI 8.6-15.5 vs. 11.1, 95% CI 7.0-15.1; p = 0.701), and median volume (0.70 mL, IQR 0.21-1.55 vs. 0.39 mL, IQR 0.10-1.62; p = 0.554). In uni- and multivariable linear regression analysis, higher eTICI scores were significantly associated with reduced PE, while the administration of alteplase was neither associated with numbers nor volume of peripheral emboli. Additional alteplase did not alter reperfusion success. CONCLUSIONS Intravenous alteplase neither affects the number nor volume of sub-angiographic DWI-PE after successful endovascular reperfusion. In the light of currently running randomized trials, further studies are warranted to validate these findings. KEY POINTS • Thrombus microfragmentation during endovascular stroke treatment may cause peripheral emboli that are only detectable on diffusion-weighted imaging and may directly compromise treatment effects. • In this prospective study, the application of intravenous alteplase did not influence the occurrence of peripheral emboli detected on high-resolution diffusion-weighted imaging. • A higher degree of recanalization was associated with a reduced number and volume of peripheral emboli and better functional outcome, while contrariwise, peripheral emboli did not modify the effect of recanalization on modified Rankin Scale scores at day 90.","Broocks, Gabriel; Meyer, Lukas; Kabiri, Reza; Kniep, Helge C; McDonough, Rosalie; Bechstein, Matthias; van Horn, Noel; Lindner, Thomas; Sedlacik, Jan; Cheng, Bastian; Thomalla, Götz; Schön, Gerhard; Fiehler, Jens; Hanning, Uta; Schönfeld, Michael H",European radiology,411,24

RESULTS 807 records were identified: 12 studies met the inclusion criteria, of which 10 were eligible for meta-analyses (one RCT and nine NRSIs). Five of the NRSIs were of high-quality while there were some concerns of bias in the RCT. Meta-analysis of 10 studies (n=2178 participants) showed a 39% reduction in risk of receiving a perioperative blood transfusion with iron compared with no iron (risk ratio 0.61, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.73, p<0.001, I2=0%). There was a significant reduction in the number of red blood cell units transfused with iron compared with no iron (mean difference -0.37units, 95% CI -0.47 to -0.27, p<0.001, I2=40%); six studies (n=1496). Length of stay was significantly reduced with iron, by an average of 2.08 days (95% CI -2.64 to -1.51, p<0.001, I2=40%); five studies (n=1140). CONCLUSIONS Preoperative iron in anaemic, elective THR or TKR patients, significantly reduces the number of patients and number of units transfused and length of stay. However, high-quality, randomised trials are lacking.

Among several candidates, a 5.9 kDa peptide identified as a fragment of the fibrinogen alpha C chain (FIC5.9) was the most promising. To move FIC5.9 toward potential diagnostic use, we developed an enzyme immunoassay that enables measurement of serum FIC5.9 levels. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN Two monoclonal antibodies specific to the N and C-termini of the 5.9-kDa peptide were used to develop a FIC5.9 sandwich ELISA. The assay was evaluated by comparing the results with those obtained by the stable isotope-labeled dilution mass spectrometry (SID-MS) using the ClinProt™ system. RESULTS The ELISA results correlated with the SID-MS findings (slope=0.795, intercept=-0.011, r(2) =0.908) and the performance of the ELISA was satisfactory in terms of recovery (98.5-103.0%) and within-run (1.4-4.7%) and between-day (2.8-8.4%) reproducibility. The assay was capable of detecting changes in FIC5.9 during abstinence from drinking in patients with alcohol dependency (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE The sandwich ELISA developed in this study will be useful for validation of the diagnostic significance of serum FIC5.9 levels in various pathological conditions, including alcoholism.","Noda, Kenta; Sogawa, Kazuyuki; Kikuchi, Wataru; Kiyokawa, Iwao; Miura, Toshihide; Kojima, Ryo; Katayama, Katsuhiro; Kodera, Yoshio; Nomura, Fumio",Proteomics.

Phages of the Skunavirus genus are by far the most isolated lactococcal phages in the cheese environments and phage p2 is the model siphophage for this viral genus. The baseplate of phage p2, which is used to recognize its host, was previously shown to display two conformations by X-ray crystallography, a rested state and an activated state ready to bind to the host. The baseplate became only activated and opened in the presence of Ca2+. However, such an activated state was not previously observed in the virion. Here, using nanobodies binding to the baseplate, we report on the negative staining electron microscopy structure of the activated form of the baseplate directly observed in the p2 virion, that is compatible with the activated baseplate crystal structure. Analyses of this new structure also established the presence of a second distal tail (Dit) hexamer as a component of the baseplate, the topology of which differs largely from the first one. We also observed an uncoupling between the baseplate activation and the tail tip protein (Tal) opening, suggesting an infection mechanism more complex than previously expected.","Spinelli, Silvia; Tremblay, Denise; Moineau, Sylvain; Cambillau, Christian; Goulet, Adeline",Viruses,411,1

The treatment of patients with active UC depends on the severity, localization and history of IBD medication. According to the classic step-up approach, treatment with 5-aminosalicylic acid compounds is the first step in the treatment of mild to moderately active UC. Corticosteroids, such as prednisolone are used in UC patients with moderate to severe disease activity, but only for remission induction therapy because of side effects associated with long-term use. Thiopurines are the next step in the treatment of active UC but monotherapy during induction therapy in UC patients is not preferred because of their slow onset. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of the pharmacologically active metabolites of thiopurines, 6-thioguanine nucleotide (6-TGN), has proven to be beneficial. Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TMPT) plays a role in the metabolic conversion pathway of thiopurines and exhibits genetic polymorphism; however, the clinical benefit and relevance of TPMT genotyping is not well established. In patients with severely active UC refractory to corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors such as ciclosporin A (CsA) and tacrolimus are potential therapeutic options. These agents usually have a rather rapid onset of action. Monoclonal antibodies (anti-tumor necrosis factor [TNF] agents, vedolizumab) are the last pharmacotherapeutic option for UC patients before surgery becomes inevitable. Body weight, albumin status and antidrug antibodies contribute to the variability in the pharmacokinetics of anti-TNF agents. Additionally, the use of concomitant immunomodulators (thiopurines/methotrexate) lowers the rate of immunogenicity, and therefore the concomitant use of anti-TNF therapy with an immunomodulator may confer some advantage compared with monotherapy in certain patients. TDM of anti-TNF agents could be beneficial in patients with primary nonresponse and secondary loss of response. The potential benefit of applying TDM during vedolizumab treatment has yet to be determined.","Berends, Sophie E; Strik, Anne S; Löwenberg, Mark; D'Haens, Geert R; Mathôt, Ron A A",Clinical pharmacokinetics,411,16

BACKGROUND Increasing evidence demonstrates that bariatric surgery can dramatically ameliorate type 2 diabetes. Not surprisingly, gastrointestinal operations are now being used throughout the world to treat diabetes in association with obesity, and increasingly, for diabetes alone. However, the role for surgery in diabetes treatment is not clearly defined and there are neither clear guidelines for these practices nor sufficient plans for clinical trials to evaluate the risks and benefits of such ""diabetes surgery."" METHODS A multidisciplinary group of 50 voting delegates from around the world gathered in Rome, Italy for the first International Conference on Gastrointestinal Surgery to Treat Type 2 Diabetes--(the ""Diabetes Surgery Summit""). During the meeting, available scientific evidence was examined and critiqued by the entire group to assess the strength of evidence and to draft consensus statements. Through an iterative process, draft statements were then serially discussed, debated, edited, reassessed, and finally presented for formal voting. After the Rome meeting, statements that achieved consensus were summarized and distributed to all voting delegates for further input and final approval. These statements were then formally critiqued by representatives of several sientific societies at the 1st World Congress on Interventional Therapies for T2DM (New York, Sept 2008). Input from this discussion was used to generate the current position statement. RESULTS A Diabetes Surgery Summit (DSS) Position Statement consists of recommendations for clinical and research issues, as well as general concepts and definitions in diabetes surgery. The DSS recognizes the legitimacy of surgical approaches to treat diabetes in carefully selected patients. For example, gastric bypass was deemed a reasonable treatment option for patients with poorly controlled diabetes and a body mass index > or =30 kg/m. Clinical trials to investigate the exact role of surgery in patients with less severe obesity and diabetes are considered a priority. Furthermore, investigations on the mechanisms of surgical control of diabetes are strongly encouraged, as they may help advance the understanding of diabetes pathophysiology. CONCLUSIONS The DSS consensus document embodies the foundations of ""diabetes surgery,"" and represents a timely attempt by leading scholars to improve access to surgical options supported by sound evidence, while also preventing harm from inappropriate use of unproven procedures.","Rubino, Francesco; Kaplan, Lee M; Schauer, Philip R; Cummings, David E",Annals of surgery,411,10

We examine how different definitions and thresholds of vaccine efficacy, coupled with different levels of implementation effectiveness and background epidemic severity, translate into outcomes including cumulative infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. Using a mathematical simulation of vaccination, we find that factors related to implementation will contribute more to the success of vaccination programs than a vaccine's efficacy as determined in clinical trials. The benefits of a vaccine will decline substantially in the event of manufacturing or deployment delays, significant vaccine hesitancy, or greater epidemic severity. Our findings demonstrate the urgent need for health officials to invest greater financial resources and attention to vaccine production and distribution programs, to redouble efforts to promote public confidence in COVID-19 vaccines, and to encourage continued adherence to other mitigation approaches, even after a vaccine becomes available.

BACKGROUND Gingival recession has been managed successfully through various surgical approaches, with great variability in outcomes. Anatomic characteristics of the recipient site and selected technique account in part for this variability. Gingival flap thickness is one of the most critical site-related characteristics. METHODS An electronic search was conducted on the major databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science). Human prospective studies with at least 6 mo of follow-up and with a numeric baseline measurement for gingival thickness were eligible. Only studies including nonsmoking patients were considered. Variables included surgical approach, participant characteristics, local anatomic factors, and follow-up time. Primary outcome was mean percentage root coverage (%RC) achieved, and complete root coverage was a secondary outcome. RESULTS A total of 42 studies were included (35 randomized controlled trials, 5 case series, 1 prospective cohort study, and 1 controlled clinical trial). Across studies, the pooled %RC was 81.9% (95% CI, 79.1% to 84.7%). The %RC was not significantly associated (P = 0.267) with baseline soft tissue thickness; however there was a significant (P = 0.031) inverse relationship between STT and %RC after 12-mo follow-up. Subgroup analysis showed that for no graft, there was a significant (P = 0.025) positive relationship between STT and %RC with the exclusion of the single outlier study based on STT. CONCLUSIONS STT plays a limited role in predicting root coverage across all approaches; when flaps are performed with no graft, the effect of STT is most critical. The length of time following surgery appears to influence outcomes, with 12-mo follow-up offering greater insight. KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER STATEMENT The results of this study can suggest to clinicians which periodontal plastic surgery technique to employ when treating challenging cases. In particular, it can be helpful when selecting the treatment approach to treat thin phenotype sites. This study could help clinicians provide a more appropriate treatment decision in such cases.","Holtzman, L Paternò; Blasi, G; Rivera, E; Herrero, F; Downton, K; Oates, T",JDR clinical and translational research,411,16

DESIGN Retrospective case review and learning curve evaluation with a skill acquisition model. Animals-27 client-owned dogs. Procedures-Between April 2011 and December 2012, 27 dogs underwent elective LESS ovariectomy performed by a single experienced board-certified laparoscopic surgeon by means of the same technique. Medical records for these patients were reviewed to determine whether a learning curve could be detected. A commercially available multitrocar port was inserted through a 15- to 20-mm incision at the umbilicus, and LESS ovariectomy was performed with articulating graspers, a bipolar vessel-sealing device, and a 30° telescope. Surgical performance of the surgeon was quantified with an exponential skill acquisition model, and how skill was gained with repetition of the same novel surgical procedure was examined. RESULTS Median patient body weight was 20 kg (44 lb; range, 3.5 to 41 kg [7.7 to 90.2 lb]). Median surgical time was 35 minutes (range, 20 to 80 minutes). Median patient age was 314 days (range, 176 to 2,913 days). The skill acquisition model revealed that a comparable surgeon could reach 90% of optimal surgery performance after approximately 8 procedures (8.6, 95% confidence interval, 0.5 to 16.6 procedures). According to the model, with each surgery, surgical time would be expected to decrease by 27% (95% confidence interval, 2% to 52%). Complications were limited to minor hemorrhage due to a splenic laceration and a postoperative incisional infection. Follow-up information was available for all 27 cases. All owners were satisfied and indicated that they would pursue LESS ovariectomy again. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE The learning curve for LESS ovariectomy was short and definable. Short-term outcome was excellent. Results of this study suggested that an experienced laparoscopic surgeon may anticipate achieving proficiency with this technique after performing approximately 8 procedures.","Runge, Jeffrey J; Boston, Raymond C; Ross, Sharona B; Brown, Dorothy C",Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,411,8

The primary aim of the present prospective study was to evaluate at which pain severity degree the quality-of-life scores will be reduced. METHOD A prospective study of patients operated for inguinal hernia was conducted. A pain questionnaire and a quality-of-life (QoL) questionnaire were completed. RESULTS Altogether, 370 patients were investigated and included in analysis. Of them, 33.8% experienced pain during different activities. Compared to the non-pain response group, significantly lower QoL scores for the Bodily pain domain were reported by patients who gave 1, 2, or 3 positive responses to the pain questionnaire. Patients with no pain as well as patients who gave 1 positive response to the pain questionnaire and whose VAS score was ≤20 had similar QoL scores for all domains. Patients who gave 1 positive response to the pain questionnaire and whose VAS score was >20, and patients who gave two or more positive responses to the pain questionnaire, showed significantly lower QoL scores in most of the domains compared with the non-pain group. When the patients who gave 1 positive response to the pain questionnaire and whose VAS score was ≤20 were excluded from the group of patients with pain, the rate of chronic pain was 19.7%. Considering the above result, the reduction in the rate of chronic pain from 33.8 to 19.7% was statistically significant. CONCLUSION Pain scores 20 mm or less on the VAS (0 to 100 mm) have no impact on the patients' quality of life. Uniform assessment methods of chronic pain should be developed to improve the quality of research.","Nikkolo, C; Kirsimägi, Ü; Vaasna, T; Murruste, M; Suumann, J; Seepter, H; Lepner, U",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,411,20

The study of therapeutic itineraries (TI) for treatment of snakebites would support strategies to provide timely access to users. A TI is the set of processes by which individuals adhere to certain forms of treatment, and includes the path traveled in the search for healthcare, and practices to solve their health problems. This study aims to describe TIs of snakebite patients in the Brazilian Amazon. This study was carried out at the Fundação de Medicina Tropical Doutor Heitor Vieira Dourado, in Manaus, state of Amazonas, Brazil. The itinerary from the moment of the bite to the patient's admission to the reference unit was analyzed. Sample size was defined by saturation. After an exploratory survey to collect epidemiological variables, in-depth interviews were conducted following a semi-structured guide. Patients originated from rural areas of 11 different municipalities, including ones located >500 kilometers from Manaus. A great fragmentation was observed in the itineraries, marked by several changes of means of transport along the route. Four themes emerged from the analysis: exposure to snakebite during day-to-day activities, use of traditional therapeutic practices, and personal perception of the severity, as well as the route taken and its contingencies. Access to healthcare requires considerable effort on the part of snakebite patients. Major barriers were identified, such as the low number of hospitals that offer antivenom treatment, poor access to healthcare due to long distances and geographic barriers, low acceptability of healthcare offered in countryside, lack of use of personal protective equipment, common use of ineffective or deleterious self-care practices, late recognition of serious clinical signs and resistance to seeking medical assistance. Health education, promotion of immediate transport to health centers and decentralization of antivenom from reference hospitals to community healthcare centers in the Brazilian Amazon are more effective strategies that would to maximize access to antivenom treatment.","Cristino, Joseir Saturnino; Salazar, Guilherme Maciel; Machado, Vinícius Azevedo; Honorato, Eduardo; Farias, Altair Seabra; Vissoci, João Ricardo Nickenig; Silva Neto, Alexandre Vilhena; Lacerda, Marcus; Wen, Fan Hui; Monteiro, Wuelton Marcelo; Sachett, Jacqueline Almeida Gonçalves",PLoS neglected tropical diseases,411,22

OBJECTIVE To examine the hypothesis that morphology of occlusive thrombus and collateral flow patterns may influence the outcome of ICA occlusions after mechanical thrombectomy. METHODS Pooled analyses of ICA occlusions in the MERCI and Multi-MERCI trials employed central angiography review readings to categorize lesions as I, L, or T clots and functional lesions based on collateral flow patterns. Demographic variables, procedural details, and clinical outcomes were compared across ICA lesion types. RESULTS A total of 72 subjects (mean age 67 years (SD 16), 51% female, median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 20 (range 8-35)) were included, with 90-day modified Rankin score ≤2 in 28% and 51% mortality. Clots were categorized as an I lesion in 9/72 (12.5%), L lesion in 12/72 (16.7%), and T lesion in 51/72 (70.8%). Based on collateral flow patterns, cases were categorized as having a functional I lesion in 7/72 (9.7%), functional L in 38/72 (52.8%), and functional T in only 27/72 (37.5%). Multivariate analyses showed that a functional T lesion, with insufficient collateral flow to ipsilateral anterior cerebral arteries via the contralateral ICA, was a strong predictor of both revascularization success and subsequent clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Collateral flow patterns distinguish the nature and impact of ICA occlusions on expected revascularization and subsequent clinical outcomes in acute ischemic stroke. The nomenclature of terminal ICA occlusions introduced here (carotid I's, L's, and T's) may enhance future endovascular trials targeting such proximal occlusions.

The greatest burden is faced by those in developing countries, where over 95% of deaths occur. Many of these deaths may have been preventable through antenatal diagnosis and early intervention. This study aims to conduct a systematic review that investigates the use of antenatal ultrasound to diagnose congenital anomalies and improve the health outcomes of infants in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods and analysis A systematic literature review will be conducted using three search strings: (1) structural congenital anomalies, (2) LMICs and (3) antenatal diagnosis. Four electronic databases will be searched: MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed and the Cochrane Library. Title, abstract and full-text screening will be undertaken in duplicate by two reviewers independently using Covidence. Consensus will be sought from the wider authorship for discrepancies. Data extraction will be undertaken by the principal investigator. The primary analysis will focus on the availability and effectiveness of antenatal ultrasound for structural congenital anomalies. Secondary outcomes will include neonatal morbidity and mortality, termination rates and referral rates for further antenatal care. Descriptive statistics and a narrative synthesis will be included in the final report. The methodological quality of the included studies will be evaluated using the Cochrane-approved Risk of Bias for Non-Randomised Studies of Intervention and Risk of Bias in Randomised Trials V.2.0 tools. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval is not required for conducting the systematic review as there will be no direct collection of data from individuals. The results will be submitted for publication in a scientific journal and presented internationally. Conclusion This is the first study, to our knowledge, to systematically review current literature on the use of antenatal ultrasound for the detection of congenital anomalies in LMICs. This is vital to define current practice, highlight global disparities and evaluate effects on health outcomes for infants in low-resource settings.

The aim of this study is to propose and validate a novel Flow diversion Predictive Score (4F-FPS) grading scale based on previously established scales that is simple and reliable. Methods We retrospectively analyzed consecutive patients who underwent endovascular treatment for cerebral aneurysms with flow diversion between January 2014 and September 2019. The included patients were randomly divided into the derivation and validation group in a 70/30 ratio, respectively. Aneurysms were classified as incomplete or complete occlusion based on final angiography outcomes. 4F-FPS was derived to predict aneurysm occlusion from multivariate logistic regression analyses in the derivation group and validated with previously published grading scales in the validation group. Results Overall, 662 patients [mean age, 53.8 years; 72.5% (480/662) female] with 662 aneurysms treated with the PipelineTM flow diverter were included [69.9% (463/662) derivation group, 30.1% (199/662) validation group]. The incidence of aneurysm occlusion was 82.7%. 4F-FPS demonstrated significant discrimination in 10-fold cross validation [mean receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area, 0.862 ± 0.055] and calibration (Cox & Snell R 2, 0.251; Nagelkerke R 2, 0.413) in the derivation group. The ROC area of 4F-FPS score in both the derivation and validation groups is the largest compared with previously published grading scales/scores (p < 0.05), which shows better sensitivity and specificity. The 4F-FPS score showed excellent prediction, discrimination, and calibration properties. Conclusion The 4F-FPS score is a simple and reliable tool to predict angiography outcome after flow diversion treatment. If widely adopted, it may provide a common language to be used in future reporting of flow diversion results for clinical trials and daily practice.

QUESTIONS/PURPOSES This clinical trial compared the visual analog scale (VAS) scores and measurement of arterial tone using augmentation index of patients who received combined spinal-epidural (CSE) only to patients who received both CSE and lumbar plexus block. METHODS After obtaining written consent, 92 patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty were randomized to receive either CSE or CSE with lumbar plexus block (LPB). Perioperative pain and arterial tone were measured using VAS scores and augmentation index (AI) respectively, at baseline and at various times postoperatively. RESULTS After the exclusion of 2 patients, 44 patients received CSE alone and 46 patients received CSE and LPB. Patient demographics and perioperative characteristics were similar in both groups. AI continuously decreased after placement of a CSE with or without LBP, beyond full resolution of neuraxial and peripheral blockade. Although the LPB group demonstrated a statistically significant reduction of VAS pain scores in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU; P < 0.05), overall, the addition of a LPB did not significantly reduce the AI when compared to the control group. CONCLUSION The addition of a LPB provided better pain control in the PACU but did not reduce the AI, compared to the control group. We conclude that the addition of a LPB may have limited ability to affect arterial tone in the presence of a continuous infusion of epidural analgesics. In summary, the addition of a LPB in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty is clinically effective and provided better pain control, especially in the immediate postoperative period. The continuous decrease on the AI in both groups beyond the full resolution of the neuroaxial and LPB will require further studies.","Goytizolo, Enrique A; Stundner, Ottokar; Rúa, Sandra Hurtado; Marcello, Dorothy; Buschiazzo, Valeria; Vaz, Ansara M; Memtsoudis, Stavros G",HSS journal : the musculoskeletal journal of Hospital for Special Surgery,411,1

We described a multimodal approach to assess patient eligible for hemispherectomy and possibly predicting post-surgical outcomes. METHODS We describe pre- and post-surgical clinical features along with neuroradiological results by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), MR-tractography (MRT), and neurophysiological study by single and paired pulses transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in a child with cerebral palsy with epileptic encephalopathy, eligible for epilepsy surgery. RESULTS Presurgical TMS evaluation showed a lateralization of motor function on the left motor cortex for both arms, and results were confirmed by MRI studies. Interestingly, after surgery, both epilepsy and motor performances improved and TMS showed enhancement of intracortical inhibition and facilitation activity. CONCLUSION Functional hemispherectomy is an effective treatment for drug-resistant epilepsy, and multimodal presurgical assessment may be a useful approach to guide surgeons in selecting patients. Moreover, pre- and post-surgical evaluation of these patients may enhance our understanding of brain plasticity phenomena.","Pilato, Fabio; Pravatà, Emanuele; Battaglia, Domenica; Calandrelli, Rosalinda; Massimi, Luca; Di Rocco, Concezio; Di Lazzaro, Vincenzo",Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery,411,28

We aimed to determine whether gut microbiota in lean women with PCOS shows any alterations compared to healthy women. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty-four lean patients with PCOS phenotype A according to the Rotterdam 2003 diagnostic criteria and 22 BMI-matched healthy women were included in this study. Anthropometric, hormonal and biochemical measurements were carried out in all participants. 16S rRNA gene V3-V4 region amplicon sequencing was performed on stool samples. Preprocessing of the raw data was performed using QIIME; and both QIIME and R packages were used for microbiome analysis. RESULTS Bacterial richness and diversity did not show a significant difference between patients and controls. Beta diversity was similar between the groups. However, Erysipelotrichaceae, Proteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, Planococaceae, Gemmales and Bacillales were significantly abundant in PCOS group according to LEfSe analysis. Clostridium cluster XVII showed increased abundance in patient group, while Clostridium sensu stricto and Roseburia were decreased compared to controls. Random forest prediction analysis revealed Clostridium cluster XIVb as the most discriminative feature of patient group and Roseburia for healthy controls.

We assessed the uptake, feasibility and effectiveness of an mHealth intervention in improving the performance of village-based frontline workers, called accredited social health activists (ASHAs), to increase the coverage of maternal, newborn and child health services in rural India. Methods. A new mobile phone application-Innovative Mobile-phone Technology for Community Health Operations (ImTeCHO)-was implemented in all the 45 villages of two primary health centres in Jhagadia, Gujarat (population ~45 000), between August 2013 and February 2014 after training 45 ASHAs. After 9 months of implementation, 99 mothers of young infants between the ages of 1 and 4 months and 187 mothers of infants between the ages of 6 and 9 months were interviewed during the household survey to assess the coverage of maternal, newborn and child health services in the project and similar control villages. Fifteen ASHAs were purposively selected and interviewed. Results. The coverage of home-based newborn care (56% v. 10%), exclusive breastfeeding (44% v. 23%), care-seeking for maternal (77% v. 57%) and neonatal complications (78% v. 27%) and pneumonia (41% v. 24%) improved in the interventional area compared to the control area.

Several lines of evidence suggest that glioblastoma multiforme has a genetic basis. A genetic test that could identify people who are at high risk of developing glioblastoma multiforme could improve our understanding of this form of brain cancer. Using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset, we found common germ line DNA copy number variations in the TCGA population. We tested whether different sets of these germ line DNA copy number variations could effectively distinguish patients with glioblastoma multiforme from others in the TCGA dataset. We used a gradient boosting machine, a machine learning classification algorithm, to classify TCGA patients solely based on a set of germline DNA copy number variations. We found that this machine learning algorithm could classify TCGA glioblastoma multiforme patients from the other TCGA patients with an area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC=0.875). Grouped into quintiles, the highest ranked quintile by the machine learning algorithm had an odds ratio of 3.78 (95% CI 3.25-4.40) higher than the average odds ratio and about 40 (95% CI 20-70) times higher than the lowest quintile. The identification of an effective germ line genetic test to stratify risk of developing glioblastoma multiforme should lead to a better understanding of how this cancer forms.

Beyond the immediate delay a backlog for future patients is expected. Such delays can lead to disease progression. OBJECTIVE We aimed to develop guidance on criteria for prioritization for surgery and reconfiguring management pathways for non-metastatic stage of prostate cancer who opt for surgical treatment. A second aim was to identify the infection prevention and control (IPC) measures to achieve low likelihood of COVID-19 hazard if radical prostatectomy was to be carried out during the outbreak and whilst the disease is endemic. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS An accelerated consensus process and systematic review. We conducted a systematic review of the evidence on COVID-19 and reviewed international guidance on prostate cancer. These were presented to an international prostate cancer expert panel (n=34) through an online meeting. The consensus process underwent three rounds of survey in total. Additions to the second- and third-round surveys were formulated based on the answers and comments from the previous rounds. OUTCOME MEASURES Consensus opinion was defined as ≥80% agreement, which were used to reconfigure the prostate cancer pathways. RESULTS Evidence on the delayed management of patients with prostate cancer is scarce. There was 100% agreement that prostate cancer pathways should be reconfigured and develop measures to prevent nosocomial COVID-19 for patients treated surgically. Consensus was reached on prioritization criteria of patients for surgery and management pathways for those who have delayed treatment. IPC measures to achieve a low likelihood of nosocomial COVID-19 were coined as ""COVID-19 cold sites"". CONCLUSION Re-configuring management pathways for prostate cancer patients is recommended if significant delay (>3-6 months) in surgical management is unavoidable.

Although type I and II IFNs have proven effective to inhibit foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) replication in swine, a similar approach had only limited efficacy in cattle. Recently, a new family of IFNs, type III IFN or IFN-λ, has been identified in human, mouse, chicken, and swine. We have identified bovine IFN-λ3 (boIFN-λ3), also known as interleukin 28B (IL-28B), and demonstrated that expression of this molecule using a recombinant replication-defective human adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) vector, Ad5-boIFN-λ3, exhibited antiviral activity against FMDV in bovine cell culture. Furthermore, inoculation of cattle with Ad5-boIFN-λ3 induced systemic antiviral activity and upregulation of IFN-stimulated gene expression in the upper respiratory airways and skin. In the present study, we demonstrated that disease could be delayed for at least 6 days when cattle were inoculated with Ad5-boIFN-λ3 and challenged 24 h later by intradermolingual inoculation with FMDV. Furthermore, the delay in the appearance of disease was significantly prolonged when treated cattle were challenged by aerosolization of FMDV, using a method that resembles the natural route of infection. No clinical signs of FMD, viremia, or viral shedding in nasal swabs was found in the Ad5-boIFN-λ3-treated animals for at least 9 days postchallenge. Our results indicate that boIFN-λ3 plays a critical role in the innate immune response of cattle against FMDV. To this end, this work represents the most successful biotherapeutic strategy so far tested to control FMDV in cattle.","Perez-Martin, Eva; Weiss, Marcelo; Diaz-San Segundo, Fayna; Pacheco, Juan M; Arzt, Jonathan; Grubman, Marvin J; de los Santos, Teresa",Journal of virology,411,1

Given physical distancing recommendations, access to traditional in-person telehealth training for providers has been limited. Telesimulation is an alternative to in-person telehealth training. Telesimulation training with both remote participants and facilitators using telehealth software has not been described. Objective: We investigated the feasibility of a large group telesimulation provider training of telehealth software for remote team leadership skills with common neonatal cases and procedures. Methods: We conducted a 90-min telesimulation session with a combination of InTouch™ provider access software and Zoom™ teleconferencing software. Zoom facilitators activated InTouch software and devices and shared their screen with remote participants. Participants rotated through skill stations and case scenarios through Zoom and directed bedside facilitators to perform simulated tasks using the shared screen and audio connection. Participants engaged in a debrief and a pre- and postsurvey assessing participants' comfort and readiness to use telemedicine. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and paired t tests. Results: Twenty (n = 20) participants, five Zoom and eight bedside facilitators participated. Twenty-one (21) pre- and 16 postsurveys were completed. Most participants were attending neonatologists who rarely used telemedicine software. Postsession, participants reported increased comfort with some advanced InTouch features, including taking and sharing pictures with the patient (p < 0.01) and drawing on the shared image (p < 0.05), but less comfort with troubleshooting technical issues, including audio and stethoscope (p < 0.01). Frequently stated concerns were troubleshooting technical issues during a call (75%, n = 16) and personal discomfort with telemedicine applications and technology (56%, n = 16). Conclusion: Large group telesimulation is a feasible way to offer telehealth training for physicians and can increase provider comfort with telehealth software.","Brei, Brianna K; Neches, Sara; Gray, Megan M; Handley, Sarah; Castera, Mark; Hedstrom, Anna; D'Cruz, Ravi; Kolnik, Sarah; Strandjord, Thomas; Mietzsch, Ulrike; Cooper, Christine; Moore, Jami M; Billimoria, Zeenia; Sawyer, Taylor; Umoren, Rachel",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,411,31

Metabolic imaging has proven useful for an increasing number of indications in oncology over the past few years, most particularly 18F-FDG PET/CT. In neuro-oncology, 18F-FDG was insufficient to clearly evaluate brain tumors. Amino-acid radiotracers such as 18F-FDOPA were then evaluated in the management of brain diseases, notably tumoral diseases. Even though European guidelines on the use of amino-acid PET in gliomas have been published, it is crucial that future studies standardize acquisition and interpretation parameters. The aim of this article was to systematically review the potential effect of this metabolic imaging technique in numerous steps of the disease: primary and recurrence diagnosis, grading, local and systemic treatment assessment, and prognosis. A total of 41 articles were included and analyzed in this review. It appears that 18F-FDOPA PET holds promise as an effective additional tool in the management of gliomas.

The purpose of this study was to create and test such a system across multiple institutions utilizing natural language processing (NLP). METHODS From 42,569 colonoscopies with pathology records from 13 centers, we randomly sampled 750 paired reports. We trained (n=250) and tested (n=500) an NLP-based program with 19 measurements that encompass colonoscopy quality measures and surveillance interval determination, using blinded, paired, annotated expert manual review as the reference standard. The remaining 41,819 nonannotated documents were processed through the NLP system without manual review to assess performance consistency. The primary outcome was system accuracy across the 19 measures. RESULTS A total of 176 (23.5%) documents with 252 (1.8%) discrepant content points resulted from paired annotation. Error rate within the 500 test documents was 31.2% for NLP and 25.4% for the paired annotators (P=0.001). At the content point level within the test set, the error rate was 3.5% for NLP and 1.9% for the paired annotators (P=0.04). When eight vaguely worded documents were removed, 125 of 492 (25.4%) were incorrect by NLP and 104 of 492 (21.1%) by the initial annotator (P=0.07). Rates of pathologic findings calculated from NLP were similar to those calculated by annotation for the majority of measurements. Test set accuracy was 99.6% for CRC, 95% for advanced adenoma, 94.6% for nonadvanced adenoma, 99.8% for advanced sessile serrated polyps, 99.2% for nonadvanced sessile serrated polyps, 96.8% for large hyperplastic polyps, and 96.0% for small hyperplastic polyps. Lesion location showed high accuracy (87.0-99.8%). Accuracy for number of adenomas was 92%. CONCLUSIONS NLP can accurately report adenoma detection rate and the components for determining guideline-adherent colonoscopy surveillance intervals across multiple sites that utilize different methods for reporting colonoscopy findings.","Imler, Timothy D; Morea, Justin; Kahi, Charles; Sherer, Eric A; Cardwell, Jon; Johnson, Cynthia S; Xu, Huiping; Ahnen, Dennis; Antaki, Fadi; Ashley, Christopher; Baffy, Gyorgy; Cho, Ilseung; Dominitz, Jason; Hou, Jason; Korsten, Mark; Nagar, Anil; Promrat, Kittichai; Robertson, Douglas; Saini, Sameer; Shergill, Amandeep; Smalley, Walter; Imperiale, Thomas F",The American journal of gastroenterology,411,31

Nevertheless, from the early years, concerns grew about the early functional results and potential recurrences. In order to evaluate of SHP with special respect to early defecation disorders und recurrences, our single institute high-volume results were evaluated. METHOD One thousand one hundred forty-four consecutive patients with SHP for prolapsing hemorrhoids were evaluated in a period from January 2007 to December 2013. In a prospective analysis, patients were followed with special respect to postoperative complications, functional disorders, mainly perianal irritation, stenosis, and recurrence. RESULTS During the timeframe, a total of 663 men and 481 women were treated for prolapsing hemorrhoids. The mean age was 52.6 years (±14.4 years). Indication for surgery was prolapsing hemorrhoids in all cases. In addition to prolapse, 90 patients (7.9 %) suffered from bleeding, 96 patients (8.4 %) had itching, and 95 (8.3 %) had anal wetness; the mean operative time was 11 min (±4 min). Patients were treated as inpatients; the mean hospital stay was 3 days (±1 day). Early complications were observed in 14 patients (1.2 %). The follow-up revealed inflammatory reaction at the stapleline in 8 patients (0.7 %) and rectal stenosis in 22 cases (1.9 %), and recurrence was observed in 46 cases (4.0 %). CONCLUSION The data presented here provide evidence that SHP is a save procedure with a very low rate for functional disorders and low recurrence rate. Therefore, in our hands, SHP remains standard for prolapsing hemorrhoids.","Voigtsberger, Arndt; Popovicova, Lucia; Bauer, Gunter; Werner, Knut; Weitschat-Benser, Tina; Petersen, Sven",International journal of colorectal disease,411,28

These fragments were found within the neck region of kogiids, an unusual anatomic site for this genus of parasites. C. magna is a species-specific parasite among kogiids, infecting only pygmy sperm whales Kogia breviceps, and with a primarily cervico-thoracic distribution. To date, however, the pattern of habitat use within the host and transmission path of this parasite remain unknown. We used detailed dissections (n = 12), histological examination of host tissues (n = 2), and scanning electron microscopy of excised nematodes (n = 7) to enhance our understanding of this host-parasite relationship. Results revealed that a critical habitat for the parasite is an exocrine gland in the whale's ventral cervical region. C. magna male and female tails were found intertwined within the glandular lumen, and eggs were observed within its presumed secretion, illuminating the transmission path out of the host. The cephalic ends of these worms were often meters away (curvilinearly), embedded deeply within epaxial muscle. A single worm's complete, tortuous 312 cm course, from the gland to its termination in the contralateral epaxial muscle, is described for the first time. This study also provides the first scanning electron micrographs of C. magna, which illustrate taxonomically important features of the heads and tails of both male and female worms.","Keenan-Bateman, Tiffany F; McLellan, William A; Costidis, Alex M; Harms, Craig A; Gay, D Mark; Rotstein, David S; Rommel, Sentiel A; Potter, Charles W; Pabst, D Ann",Diseases of aquatic organisms,411,31

However, data on outcome of LSG regarding nutrient deficiencies, protein status, and body composition are scarce. METHODS Obese subjects (54; f:m = 4:1) scheduled for LSG were included in this study. Micronutrient analysis, protein status assessment, and bioimpedance measures were performed before and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after LSG. RESULTS In 51% of the subjects, at least one micronutrient deficiency was found prior to surgery. Baseline concentrations were below normal for 25-OH vitamin D (27%), iron (29%), vitamin B6 (11%), vitamin B12 (9%), folate (6%), and potassium (7%). Frequencies of deficiencies for vitamin B12, folate, iron, and vitamin B6 tended to increase following LSG within the first year after intervention. Also, parameters of protein status (albumin, transferrin, cholinesterase, and total protein) decreased. After surgery, bioimpedance measures indicated a reduction of total body fat, but also of body cell mass. CONCLUSIONS Preoperative micronutrient deficiencies were common in morbid obese individuals scheduled for LSG. LSG had a modest effect on micronutrient status by further reducing iron, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and folate within the first year after intervention. Our data suggest that especially obese patients with preoperative deficits require control and supplementation of micronutrients and protein in the postoperative period.","Damms-Machado, Antje; Friedrich, Asja; Kramer, Klaus Michael; Stingel, Katrin; Meile, Tobias; Küper, Markus A; Königsrainer, Alfred; Bischoff, Stephan C",Obesity surgery,411,24

This study was conducted in the immediate aftermath of this difficult period. OBJECTIVES to describe clinical characteristics, short-term outcomes, and management of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients that accessed the emergency department (ED) of the San Luigi Gonzaga hospital of Orbassano (Turin district, Piedmont Region, Northern Italy) in March and April 2020. Furthermore, this study aimed at investigating if a difference in patients characteristics, clinical management, and outcomes was present during time. DESIGN comparison of different periods in a clinical cohort. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS for each patient who accessed the ED and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 swab, the ED medical record was collected and a descriptive analysis was performed on demographical characteristics, pre-existing comorbidities, parameters measured at triage, imaging exams results, lab tests results, separately for patients admitted at the ED in four different periods. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES discharge from ED, admission to hospital wards (low and high intensity of care), short term in-hospital mortality, hospital length of stay. The association between patients' characteristics and the main outcomes was measured using multivariable logistic models. RESULTS age of patients increased significantly from March to April, together with female prevalence and associated comorbid conditions. A significant difference in symptoms at presentation was not observed nor it was in laboratory test results. Severity at triage and need of intensive care resources were higher in the first weeks, together with the typical clinical presentation with respiratory failure and imaging with signs of bilateral interstitial pneumonia. Accordingly, in-hospital mortality was higher in the first period. Nevertheless, nearly half of patients in the first period were discharged directly from ED showing mild COVID-19 cases. On the contrary, in April an increasing need of hospitalisation in low intensity of care beds was observed, whereas mild cases stopped to access the ED. CONCLUSIONS the results of this study suggest that in few weeks of COVID-19 epidemic both management of the patients at the hospital level - and probably at territorial level resulting in a different population who accessed to the ED - and the clinical characteristics of the COVID-19 patients changed.","Caramello, Valeria; Maciotta, Alessandro; De Salve, Alessandro Vincenzo; Gobbi, Valentina; Ruffino, Tommaso Maria; Mazzetti, Giulia; Ricagni, Lorenzo; Ling, Camilla; Arione, Roberto; Boccuzzi, Adriana; Costa, Giuseppe; Sacerdote, Carlotta; Ricceri, Fulvio",Epidemiologia e prevenzione,411,1

METHOD AND MATERIALS Eighty extracted mandibular incisors with small oval root canals were instrumented with the Self-Adjusting File (Redent Nova). GuttaFlow 2 was placed using a lentulo spiral, paper point, master point, or sonically activated CanalBrush (Coltène/Whaledent), followed by the placement of a master point and accessory points (MP+) (part 1). GuttaFlow 2 was placed using a lentulo spiral without a gutta-percha point, together with a single point, with a chloroform-dipped master point, or the latter with accessory points (ChMP+) (part 2). Serial cuts were made at 1-mm intervals up to 10 mm. The percentages of gutta-percha filled area (PGFA), sealer, voids, and debris were evaluated using interactive image analysis software. RESULTS For part 1 of the study (sealer placement), significant differences regarding PGFA at 2 and 5 mm from the apex were found, whereas for part 2 (filling technique), significant differences were found at all levels besides 2 and 4 mm (Kruskal-Wallis test, P ≤ .05). ChMP+ reached 85% PGFA at 3 mm from the apex, but only 30% near the apex. The MP+ groups showed a relatively equal distribution of PGFA by 60% to 80% at different levels. GuttaFlow 2 without a gutta-percha point exhibited significantly more voids and debris than the other groups (Kruskal-Wallis test, P ≤ .05). CONCLUSION Within the limits of this study, MP+ could be recommended for clinical use. The presence of voids and debris for the group without a gutta-percha point needs further investigation.","Haverroth Schüneman N, Fernanda; Höpfner Canani, Soraia; Lohbauer, Ulrich; Petschelt, Anselm; Metzger, Zvi; Ebert, Johannes",Quintessence international,411,12

METHODS Between September 2005 and 2012, 18 jugulotympanic, 7 vagal, and 4 carotid body paragangliomas (CBPs) underwent Onyx embolization, accordingly to our head and neck multidisciplinary team's decision. CBPs were embolized preoperatively. Jugulotympanic and vagal paragangliomas underwent surgery when feasible, otherwise palliative embolization was carried out alone, or in combination with radiotherapy or tympanic surgery in the case of skull base or tympanic extension. Treatment results, and clinical and MRI follow-up data were recorded. RESULTS In all cases, devascularization of at least 60% of the initial tumor blush was obtained; 6 patients underwent two embolizations. Post-embolization, 8 patients presented with cranial nerve palsy, with partial or complete regression at follow-up (mean 31 months, range 3-86 months), except for 2 vagal and 1 hypoglossal palsy. 10 patients were embolized preoperatively; 70% were cured after surgery and 30% showed residual tumor. 19 patients received palliative embolization, of whom 5 underwent radiotherapy and 3 received tympanic surgery post-embolization. Long term follow-up of palliative embolization resulted in tumor volume stability (75%) or extension in intracranial or tympanic compartments. Onyx embolization of CBPs resulted in more difficult surgical dissection in 2 of 4 cases. CONCLUSIONS Onyx embolization is a valuable alternative to surgery in the treatment of jugulotympanic and vagal paragangliomas; tympanic surgery or radiosurgery of the skull base should be considered in selected cases. Preoperative Onyx embolization of CBPs is not recommended.","Michelozzi, Caterina; Januel, Anne Christine; Cuvinciuc, Victor; Tall, Philippe; Bonneville, Fabrice; Fraysse, Bernard; Deguine, Olivier; Serrano, Elie; Cognard, Christophe",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,411,10

APPROACH Electrode contacts with diameters of 0.3 mm and 4 mm are localized in 1.5 T MRI using reference structures made of silicone and iron oxide nanoparticle doping. The precision of the localization procedure was assessed for several standard MRI sequences and implant orientations in phantom experiments and compared to common clinical localization procedures. MAIN RESULTS A localization precision of 0.41±0.20 mm could be achieved for both electrode diameters compared to 1.46±0.69 mm that was achieved for 4 mm standard electrode contacts localized using a common clinical standard method. The new reference structures are intrinsically bio-compatible, and they can be detected with currently available feature detection software so that a clinical implementation of this technology should be feasible. SIGNIFICANCE Neuropathologies are increasingly diagnosed and treated with subdural electrodes, where the exact localization of the electrode contacts with respect to the patient's cortical anatomy is a prerequisite for the procedure. Post-implantation electrode localization using MRI may be advantageous compared to the common alternative of CT-MRI image co-registration, as it avoids systematic localization errors associated with the co-registration itself, as well as brain shift and implant movement. Additionally, MRI provides superior soft tissue contrast for the identification of brain lesions without exposing the patient to ionizing radiation. Recent studies show that smaller electrodes and high-density electrode grids are ideal for clinical and research purposes, but the localization of these devices in MRI has not been demonstrated.","Erhardt, Johannes B; Lottner, Thomas; Pasluosta, Cristian; Gessner, Isabel; Mathur, Sanjay; Schuettler, Martin; Bock, Michael; Stieglitz, Thomas",Journal of neural engineering,411,16

However, country of origin, race/ethnicity, and risk behaviors associated with acculturation, including hazardous drinking, can affect the prevalence of hypertension. Additionally, health disparities across immigration/nativity status may be associated with suboptimal antihypertensive treatment and control of hypertension. In the present study, population-based data from the years 2016 to 2018 of the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) were analyzed to assess the association of nativity status and hazardous drinking with hypertension among US-born and foreign-born Hispanic populations. Age-adjusted prevalence of past-year hypertension among foreign-born Hispanics was lower than US-born Hispanics. However, the proportion of Hispanic immigrants who had their blood pressure checked by a healthcare professional was also smaller than US-born Hispanics, suggesting that the prevalence of hypertension among Hispanic immigrants may be underreported.

Dexmedetomidine (Dex) might be beneficial for postoperative cognitive function in elderly patients. However, the exact mechanism underlying the protective role of Dex against cognitive impairment requires further elucidation. The present study aims to determine whether miR-129 is involved in the protective effect of Dex against Aβ1-42-induced hippocampal neuron apoptosis and cognitive impairment in mice. In our study, Y-shaped maze and water maze tests were conducted to evaluate the cognitive function of AD mice, while neuronal apoptosis was measured by Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase-Mediated dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) staining. The findings showed that Dex administration resulted in the enhancement of miR-129 expression with declined hippocampal neuron apoptosis and attenuated cognitive impairment in Aβ1-42-injected mice. miR-129 targeted YAP1 and disrupted its interaction with JAG1, leading to a decline in hippocampal neuron apoptosis and attenuated cognitive impairment in Aβ1-42-injected mice. In conclusion, the miR-129/YAP1/JAG1 axis could potentially be the mechanism by which Dex protects AD mice from cognitive impairment.","Sun, Weiying; Zhao, Jun; Li, Chunzhi",Molecular neurobiology,411,6

Control of odors is also socially important and believed to be a societal measure of cleanliness. Understanding the need for good cleaning and disinfecting is even more important today considering the potential spread of emerging pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 virus. While the flush toilet was a major advancement in achieving these objectives, exposure to pathogens can occur from failure to clean and disinfectant areas within a restroom, as well as poor hand hygiene. The build-up of biofilm within a toilet bowl/urinal including sink can result in the persistence of pathogens and odors. During flushing, pathogens can be ejected from the toilet bowl/urinal/sink and be transmitted by inhalation and contaminated fomites. Use of automatic toilet bowl cleaners can reduce the number of microorganisms ejected during a flush. Salmonella bacteria can colonize the underside of the rim of toilets and persist up to 50 days. Pathogenic enteric bacteria appear in greater numbers in the biofilm found in toilets than in the water. Source tracking of bacteria in homes has demonstrated that during cleaning enteric bacteria are transferred from the toilet to the bathroom sinks and that these same bacteria colonize cleaning tools used in the restroom. Quantitative microbial risk assessment has shown that significant risks exist from both aerosols and fomites in restrooms. Cleaning with soaps and detergents without the use of disinfectants in public restrooms may spread bacteria and viruses throughout the restroom. Odors in restrooms are largely controlled by ventilation and flushing volume in toilet/urinals. However, this results in increased energy and water usage. Contamination of both the air and surfaces in restrooms is well documented. Better quantification of the risks of infection are needed as this well help determine what interventions will minimize these risks.","Abney, Sarah E; Bright, Kelly R; McKinney, Julie; Ijaz, M Khalid; Gerba, Charles P",Journal of applied microbiology,411,16

Currently in the spotlight as vital components of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, LNPs play a key role in effectively protecting and transporting mRNA to cells. Liposomes, an early version of LNPs, are a versatile nanomedicine delivery platform. A number of liposomal drugs have been approved and applied to medical practice. Subsequent generations of lipid nanocarriers, such as solid lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers, and cationic lipid-nucleic acid complexes, exhibit more complex architectures and enhanced physical stabilities. With their ability to encapsulate and deliver therapeutics to specific locations within the body and to release their contents at a desired time, LNPs provide a valuable platform for treatment of a variety of diseases. Here, we present a landscape of LNP-related scientific publications, including patents and journal articles, based on analysis of the CAS Content Collection, the largest human-curated collection of published scientific knowledge. Rising trends are identified, such as nanostructured lipid carriers and solid lipid nanoparticles becoming the preferred platforms for numerous formulations. Recent advancements in LNP formulations as drug delivery platforms, such as antitumor and nucleic acid therapeutics and vaccine delivery systems, are discussed. Challenges and growth opportunities are also evaluated in other areas, such as medical imaging, cosmetics, nutrition, and agrochemicals.

For this review, the English-language literature was searched for studies of interventions in CKD reporting an original incremental cost-utility (cost per QALY) or cost-effectiveness (cost per life-year) ratio. Published cost studies that did not report cost-effectiveness or cost-utility ratios were also reviewed. League tables were then created for both cost-utility and cost-effectiveness ratios to assess interventions in patients with stage 1-4 CKD, waitlist and transplant patients and those with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In addition, the percentage of cost-saving or dominant interventions (those that save money and improve health) was compared across these three disease categories. A total of 84 studies were included, contributing 72 cost-utility ratios, 20 cost-effectiveness ratios and 42 other cost measures. Many of the interventions were dominant over the comparator, indicating better health outcomes and lower costs. For the three disease categories, the greatest number of dominant or cost-saving interventions was reported for stage 1-4 CKD patients, followed by waitlist and transplant recipients and those with ESRD (91%, 87% and 55% of studies reporting a dominant or cost-saving intervention, respectively). There is evidence of opportunities to lower costs in the treatment of patients with CKD, while either improving or maintaining the quality of care. In order to realize these cost savings, efforts will be required to promote and effectively implement changes in treatment practices.","Menzin, Joseph; Lines, Lisa M; Weiner, Daniel E; Neumann, Peter J; Nichols, Christine; Rodriguez, Lauren; Agodoa, Irene; Mayne, Tracy",PharmacoEconomics,411,1

Its neighboring Bundesländer (federal states), on the other hand, were slow to impose such clear restrictions. By comparing 38 Landkreise (counties) alongside Bavaria's border from March 15 to May 11 using data from the Robert Koch Institute, we produced for each Landkreis its (1) time-dependent reproduction numbers (Rt) and (2) growth rates in confirmed cases.Results. The demographics of the Landkreise were similar enough to allow for difference-in-difference analyses.

Behavioral symptoms with cognitive impairment may mimic the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and other early-onset dementias. We analyzed our patients and reviewed the literature to delineate neurological and neuroimaging findings suggestive of NHD. METHOD Fourteen patients carrying a pathogenic mutation in the TREM2 gene were found in our database. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological data were retrieved and analyzed. RESULTS Presenting clinical picture was behavioral changes with cognitive decline resembling bvFTD in all patients. The mean age was 37.1±4.97 years, the mean duration of the disease was 8.9±3.51 years. Only two patients had typical bone cysts. Seven patients had bilateral calcification of the basal ganglia in the computerized tomography of the brain. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed severe atrophy of the corpus callosum, enlargement of the ventricles, atrophy of the caudate nuclei, periventricular white matter changes in all patients. Symmetrical global atrophy of the brain, mainly affecting frontoparietal and lateral temporal regions were observed in all cases, and 13 patients had atrophy of hippocampus. Cerebrospinal fluid examination of ten patients showed elevated protein levels in six and the presence of oligoclonal bands in four patients. CONCLUSION A combination of white matter changes, enlarged ventricles, atrophy of caudate nuclei, thinning of the corpus callosum in MRI strongly suggests NHD in patients with FTD syndrome.

METHODS In the double-blind THALES (The Acute Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack Treated With Ticagrelor and ASA for Prevention of Stroke and Death) trial, we randomized patients with a noncardioembolic, nonsevere ischemic stroke, or high-risk transient ischemic attack to ticagrelor (180 mg loading dose on day 1 followed by 90 mg twice daily for days 2-30) or placebo added to aspirin (300-325 mg on day 1 followed by 75-100 mg daily for days 2-30) within 24 hours of symptom onset. The present paper reports a prespecified analysis in patients with and without ipsilateral, potentially causal atherosclerotic stenosis ≥30% of cervicocranial vasculature. The primary end point was time to the occurrence of stroke or death within 30 days. RESULTS Of 11 016 randomized patients, 2351 (21.3%) patients had an ipsilateral atherosclerotic stenosis. After 30 days, a primary end point occurred in 92/1136 (8.1%) patients with ipsilateral stenosis randomized to ticagrelor and in 132/1215 (10.9%) randomized to placebo (hazard ratio 0.73 [95% CI, 0.56-0.96], P=0.023) resulting in a number needed to treat of 34 (95% CI, 19-171). In patients without ipsilateral stenosis, the corresponding event rate was 211/4387 (4.8%) and 230/4278 (5.4%), respectively (hazard ratio, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.74-1.08]; P=0.23, Pinteraction=0.245). Severe bleeding occurred in 4 (0.4%) and 3 (0.2%) patients with ipsilateral atherosclerotic stenosis on ticagrelor and on placebo, respectively (P=NS), and in 24 (0.5%) and 4 (0.1%), respectively, in 8665 patients without ipsilateral stenosis (hazard ratio=5.87 [95% CI, 2.04-16.9], P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS In this exploratory analysis comparing ticagrelor added to aspirin to aspirin alone, we found no treatment by ipsilateral atherosclerosis stenosis subgroup interaction but did identify a higher absolute risk and a greater absolute risk reduction of stroke or death at 30 days in patients with ipsilateral atherosclerosis stenosis than in those without. In this easily identified population, ticagrelor added to aspirin provided a clinically meaningful benefit with a number needed to treat of 34 (95% CI, 19-171).

Depression is the second chronic disease, as a source of the global burden of disease, after heart disease. Its prevalence elevated seven times during the COVID-19. AIM The current study was designed to evaluate camphor neuroprotective role against rats' ciprofloxacin-induced depression. MATERIALS AND METHODS Depression was induced by administration of ciprofloxacin (50 mg/kg; orally) for 21 days. Wister albino male rats were divided into five groups. Group I (normal control): rats were given normal saline. Group II: rats received camphor (10 mg/kg; i.p.) for 21 days. Group III (depression control): rats received ciprofloxacin only. Groups IV and V: rats received camphor (5 and 10 mg/kg; i.p.) for 21 days concurrent with ciprofloxacin. Behavior tests as forced swimming test, activity cage, and rotarod were estimated. Oxidative stress and antioxidant biomarkers as malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), catalase, and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) besides inflammatory biomarkers as Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) as well as neurotransmitters were determined. Finally, histopathological examination was done. RESULTS Camphor increased catalase and Nrf-2 activities, decreased NO, MDA, TNF-α, TLR4 serum levels, and elevating brain contents of serotonin, dopamine, gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) and P190-RHO GTP protein with normal neuronal cells of the frontal cortex.

Methods: The data of cases of COVID-19 epidemic clusters from 19 January, 2020 to 25 February, 2020 were collected from the official platforms of 36 cities in 6 provinces in China. Descriptive statistical methods, χ(2) test and curve fitting were used to analyze the epidemiological characteristics of the clustered cases. Results: By 25 February, 2020, the data of 1 052 cases in 366 epidemic clusters were collected. In these clustered cases, 86.9%(914/1 050) occurred in families. Among the 1 046 cases with gender information, 513 were males (49.0%) and 533 were females (51.0%). The cases were mainly young adults between 18 and 59 years old, accounting for 68.5% (711/1 038). In the 366 epidemic clusters , the clusters in which the first confirmed cases with the history of sojourn in Wuhan or Hubei accounted for 47.0%(172/366). From 19 January to 3 February, 2020, the first confirmed cases with Wuhan or Hubei sojourn history accounted for 66.5%. From 4 to 25 February, the first confirmed cases who had Wuhan or Hubei sojourn history accounted for only 18.2%. The median of interval between the first generation case onset and the second generation case onset was 5 (2-8) days. The median of onset- diagnosis interval of the initial cases was 6 (3-9) days, and the median of onset-diagnosis interval of the secondary cases was 5 (3-8) days. Conclusions: Epidemic clusters of COVID-19 were common in many cities outside Wuhan and Hubei. Close contact in family was one of the main causes for the spread of household transmission of the virus. After 4 February, the epidemic clusters were mainly caused by the first generation or second generation cases in local areas, and the time for diagnosis became shorter.","Gan, H; Zhang, Y; Yuan, M; Wu, X Y; Liu, Z R; Liu, M; Wu, J B; Xu, S J; Gong, L; Xu, H L; Tao, F B",Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,411,7

Understanding today's gains and gaps for the health-related SDGs is essential for decision makers as they aim to improve the health of populations. As part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016), we measured 37 of the 50 health-related SDG indicators over the period 1990-2016 for 188 countries, and then on the basis of these past trends, we projected indicators to 2030. METHODS We used standardised GBD 2016 methods to measure 37 health-related indicators from 1990 to 2016, an increase of four indicators since GBD 2015. We substantially revised the universal health coverage (UHC) measure, which focuses on coverage of essential health services, to also represent personal health-care access and quality for several non-communicable diseases. We transformed each indicator on a scale of 0-100, with 0 as the 2·5th percentile estimated between 1990 and 2030, and 100 as the 97·5th percentile during that time. An index representing all 37 health-related SDG indicators was constructed by taking the geometric mean of scaled indicators by target. On the basis of past trends, we produced projections of indicator values, using a weighted average of the indicator and country-specific annualised rates of change from 1990 to 2016 with weights for each annual rate of change based on out-of-sample validity. 24 of the currently measured health-related SDG indicators have defined SDG targets, against which we assessed attainment. FINDINGS Globally, the median health-related SDG index was 56·7 (IQR 31·9-66·8) in 2016 and country-level performance markedly varied, with Singapore (86·8, 95% uncertainty interval 84·6-88·9), Iceland (86·0, 84·1-87·6), and Sweden (85·6, 81·8-87·8) having the highest levels in 2016 and Afghanistan (10·9, 9·6-11·9), the Central African Republic (11·0, 8·8-13·8), and Somalia (11·3, 9·5-13·1) recording the lowest. Between 2000 and 2016, notable improvements in the UHC index were achieved by several countries, including Cambodia, Rwanda, Equatorial Guinea, Laos, Turkey, and China; however, a number of countries, such as Lesotho and the Central African Republic, but also high-income countries, such as the USA, showed minimal gains. Based on projections of past trends, the median number of SDG targets attained in 2030 was five (IQR 2-8) of the 24 defined targets currently measured. Globally, projected target attainment considerably varied by SDG indicator, ranging from more than 60% of countries projected to reach targets for under-5 mortality, neonatal mortality, maternal mortality ratio, and malaria, to less than 5% of countries projected to achieve targets linked to 11 indicator targets, including those for childhood overweight, tuberculosis, and road injury mortality. For several of the health-related SDGs, meeting defined targets hinges upon substantially faster progress than what most countries have achieved in the past. INTERPRETATION GBD 2016 provides an updated and expanded evidence base on where the world currently stands in terms of the health-related SDGs. Our improved measure of UHC offers a basis to monitor the expansion of health services necessary to meet the SDGs. Based on past rates of progress, many places are facing challenges in meeting defined health-related SDG targets, particularly among countries that are the worst off. In view of the early stages of SDG implementation, however, opportunity remains to take actions to accelerate progress, as shown by the catalytic effects of adopting the Millennium Development Goals after 2000. With the SDGs' broader, bolder development agenda, multisectoral commitments and investments are vital to make the health-related SDGs within reach of all populations.

The association between walking pain and self-rated health (SRH) after TKA is not known. This prospective longitudinal study aimed to investigate the association between a comprehensive list of preoperative factors, postoperative pain with walking, and SRH 12 months after TKA. METHODS Patients (N = 156) scheduled for TKA completed questionnaires that evaluated demographic and clinical characteristics, symptoms, psychological factors, and SRH. SRH was re-assessed 12 months after TKA. Clinical variables were retrieved from medical records. Pain with walking was assessed before surgery, at 6 weeks, 3, and 12 months after TKA. Subgroups with distinct trajectories of pain with walking over time were identified using growth mixture modeling. Multiple linear regression was used to investigate the relationships between pain with walking and other factors on SRH. RESULTS Higher body mass index, a higher number of painful sites at 12 months, recurrent pain with walking group membership, ketamine use, higher depression scores, and poorer preoperative self-rated health were associated with poorer SRH 12 months after TKA. The final model was statistically significant (p = 0.005) and explained 56.1% of the variance in SRH 12 months after surgery. SRH improved significantly over time. Higher C-reactive protein levels, higher number of painful sites before surgery, higher fatigue severity, and more illness concern was associated with poorer preoperative SRH. CONCLUSIONS In patients whose walking ability decreases over time, clinicians need to assess for unreleaved pain and decreases in SRH. Additional research is needed on interventions to improve walking ability and SRH.","Lindberg, Maren Falch; Rustøen, Tone; Miaskowski, Christine; Rosseland, Leiv Arne; Lerdal, Anners",BMC musculoskeletal disorders,411,1

Previously, aspiring parents often resorted to adoption. Today, the availability of assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) has provided options other than adoption for those desiring to procreate. Through ARTs, aspirations for a family may be attained through an exchange of reproductive goods and services, and not necessarily through traditional heterosexual relationships. ARTs have altered the perception of parenthood as it exists in Nigeria, and courts face a difficult task in defining parenthood within Nigerian jurisprudence, as they can only adjudicate based on extant law. Although ARTs provide greater individual choices for fulfilling the desire to procreate, they raise a number of ethical and legal issues that evolving legal systems, such as that in Nigeria, are ill-equipped to manage. This paper describes the traditional assignment of parenthood under indigenous laws and other sources of law within the Nigerian jurisprudence. We carried out an in-depth study of the Nigerian legislative framework and found that there are no laws directly regulating parenthood, procreation and ARTs in Nigeria. We also found that the extant laws are only tangentially related and do not answer the relevant questions sufficiently well, especially concerning succession, nationality and assignment of responsibility in collaborative reproduction. We conclude by highlighting the need for and recommending a regulatory framework on ARTs with a particular focus on providing a definition for parenthood achieved through ARTs in Nigeria.","Egbokhare, Olohikhuae O; Akintola, Simisola O",Bioethics,411,1

METHODS In vitro studies were designed to anticipate device deformations in bifurcations. Large, wide-necked bifurcation aneurysms were constructed in 21 animals and treated 4-8 weeks later using stents and FDs in various combinations, forming four main groups: parent artery to right branch flow diversion (RBFD, n = 6), parent artery to left branch flow diversion (LBFD, n = 6), Y flow diversion (YFD, n = 4), and compared with high-porosity Y-stenting (YHPS, n = 4). The results include immediate and follow-up angiography at 3 months, followed by grading of the extent of neointimal coverage of devices at pathology. RESULTS In vitro, all braided devices showed varying porosities according to characteristic zones. FDs can be compacted to decrease porosities, but a limiting factor is the constant presence of a more porous transition zone. In vivo, 3/6 RBFD, 4/6 LBFD, and 2/4 YFD treated aneurysms had decreased in size by 3 months, while those treated with YHPS increased in size (P = 0.15). There was a significant correlation between device porosities and extent of neointimal coverage (r = 0.639, P = 0.002), and between porosities and angiographic evolution (r = -0.655, P = 0.002), but not between neointima formation and angiographic evolution (r = -0.278, P = 0.235). Failures could be explained in all cases by the presence of leaks or holes in the neointima at the level of the transition zones. CONCLUSION FDs did not successfully treat most bifurcation aneurysms, at least in this animal model.","Raymond, Jean; Darsaut, Tim E; Makoyeva, Alina; Bing, Fabrice; Salazkin, Igor",Neuroradiology,411,16

While still under evaluation, the Woven Endobridge (WEB) aneurysm embolization system has so far shown promising results in the treatment of complex bifurcation aneurysms. We aimed to evaluate the feasibility and short-term follow-up of endovascular treatment of ruptured wide-neck aneurysm with the WEB device. METHODS Six patients referred to our institution for acute symptomatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and treated with the WEB device were enrolled in this study. Clinical presentations, technical details, intraoperative and postoperative complications, and outcomes were recorded. Immediate and 3-month angiographic results were also evaluated. RESULTS Three middle cerebral artery (MCA) and three anterior communicating artery aneurysms were treated between 1 and 14 days after rupturing. Average dome width was 5.8 mm (range 5-7), average neck size was 4.5 mm (range 4-5), and average dome-to-neck ratio was 1.3 (range 1-1.7). The WEB system was the exclusive treatment and was successfully deployed in all cases. Per procedural thromboembolic events occurred in two cases and were treated with intra-arterial administration of antiplatelet agents without any clinical consequences. The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at discharge was 0 for all patients. The 3-month angiographic follow-up showed adequate occlusion in four of our six patients (67 %). CONCLUSION From this preliminary study, the high feasibility rate and lack of need for systematic antiplatelet agents favor the WEB device providing a solution for endovascular treatment of ruptured wide-neck bifurcation aneurysms during the acute phase. However, further studies are needed to evaluate the complication rate and long-term efficiency.","Caroff, Jildaz; Mihalea, Cristian; Dargento, Francesco; Neki, Hiroaki; Ikka, Léon; Benachour, Nidhal; Moret, Jacques; Spelle, Laurent",Neuroradiology,411,19

METHODS Physical behavior and fitness were assessed in participants of the study Surgery or Lifestyle With Intensive Medical Management in the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (SLIMM-T2D) (NCT01073020), a randomized, parallel-group trial conducted at a US academic hospital and diabetes clinic with 18- to 24-month follow-up. Thirty-eight type 2 diabetes patients with hemoglobin A1c ≥6.5% and body mass index 30-42 kg/m2 were randomized to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or the medical program. A 6-minute walk test to evaluate fitness, self-reported physical activity, standardized physical surveys, and cardiometabolic risk assessment were performed at baseline and after intervention. RESULTS Both groups similarly improved 6-minute walk test distance, with greater improvements in oxygen saturation and reduced heart rate after surgery. Self-reported physical activity improved similarly at 18-24 months after interventions, although exercise increased gradually after surgery, whereas early substantial increases in the medical group were not fully sustained. Self-reported total and physical health were similar by Short Form-36 but improved more in the Impact of Weight on Quality of Life survey after surgery. Improvement in cardiovascular risk scores, HbA1c, and body mass index were greater after surgery. CONCLUSION In this small, randomized study, both interventions led to therapeutic lifestyle changes and improved objective and self-reported physical fitness. Greater improvements in heart rate, oxygen saturation, and perceived impact of weight on health were seen after surgery, which could be attributable to greater weight loss. The clinical importance of these improvements with greater weight loss warrants further investigation.","Panosian, Jennifer; Ding, Su-Ann; Wewalka, Marlene; Simonson, Donald C; Goebel-Fabbri, Ann; Foster, Kathleen; Halperin, Florencia; Vernon, Ashley; Goldfine, Allison B",The American journal of medicine,411,26

The recent COVID-19 pandemic underlined the need for high-quality remote care. This review gives a current overview of digital tools for remotely assessing visual function and reports on their accuracy. METHODS We searched the databases of Embase and Pubmed, and systematically reviewed the literature, conforming to PRISMA guidelines. Two preliminary papers were added from medRxiv.org. The main outcome was the agreement of the digital tools with conventional clinical charts, as expressed by mean differences and 95% limits of agreement (95% LoA). RESULTS Seventeen publications included studies reported on 13 different digital tools. Most of the tools focus on distance visual acuity. The mean differences of the digital tools ranged from - 0.08 to 0.10 logMAR, when compared to traditional clinical assessments. The 95% LoA differed considerably between studies: from ± 0.08 logMAR to ± 0.47 logMAR, though the variability was less pronounced for higher visual acuities. CONCLUSION The low mean differences between digital visual acuity assessments and reference charts suggest clinical equivalence, though the wide 95% LoA identify a lower precision of digital self-assessments. This effect diminishes in individuals with better visual acuities, which is a common feature of visual acuity assessments. There is great potential for the digital tools to increase access to eye care and we expect the accuracy of the current tools to improve with every iteration in technology development.","Claessens, Janneau L J; Geuvers, Judith R; Imhof, Saskia M; Wisse, Robert P L",Ophthalmology and therapy,411,1

The characteristic of the disease is development of pneumonia. We aimed to investigate the accuracy of bedside lung ultrasound (BLUS) for diagnosing Covid-19 pneumonia, and its effectiveness for the correct triage of patients with suspected Covid-19 in the emergency department (ED). METHODS This study was a prospective, cross-sectional cohort study. During their shifts, 3 accredited and certificated emergency physicians performed BLUS using BLUE protocol at the triage area of the ED on patients with suspected Covid-19. All of the patients underwent chest computed tomography. The BLUS findings were statistically compared with formal radiology reports of computed tomographies as the criterion standard for the diagnosis of Covid-19 pneumonia. Kolmogorov-Smirnov analysis, Shapiro-Wilk test, and Q-Q plots were performed with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for statistical analysis. RESULTS A total of 72 patients were included in the study. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and overall accuracy of BLUS were 96.9% (95% CI, 84.2%-99.9%), 92.3% (95% CI, 79.1%-98.3%), 84.3% (95% CI, 64.5%-94.1%), 98.6% (95% CI, 91.1%-99.8%), and 93.7% (95% CI, 85.3%-98.0%), respectively. The positive and negative predictive values were 84.3% (95% CI, 64.5%-94.1%) and 98.6% (95% CI, 91.1%-99.8%), respectively. The area under curve was found to be 0.946 (95% CI, 0.866-0.986; P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Bedside lung ultrasound can be used to detect the presence of pulmonary involvement in suspected cases of Covid-19 for the effective triage of patients in the ED.","Karagöz, Arif; Sağlam, Caner; Demirbaş, Hakan Bariş; Korkut, Semih; Ünlüer, Erden Erol",Ultrasound quarterly,411,19

By using statistical analysis, we study whether investors’ reactions can be linked to different patterns of capital budgeting decisions. Our database includes a high number of countries, both developed and emerging, which leads us to focus our analysis on the differences that might occur in investors’ preferences due to specific traits of these markets. Additionally, we include a comparison between investors’ preferences and the information given by the accounting-based performance recorded both in the year of the investment policy and in the next fiscal year. Thus, we observe the extent and limits of the investors’ preference for an active capital budgeting decision, as well as the investors’ rationality around financial crisis.","Curmei-Semenescu, Andreea Ţilică Elena Valentina Cătălin Valeriu Curmei",Sustainability,411,16

The continuous formulation of the SIR model is represented by a set of three coupled differential equations that can be solved numerically. Due to the dynamics of the simulation, the SIR model is best when simulating diseases that confer a lasting immunity. More complex models for disease transmission are typically derived from this base model and can include features such as additional infectious stages, stochastic frameworks, vaccines, and finite immunity. In this case study, I first examine the features of the continuous model. Then, I create a discrete model, which simulates individuals that transmit the disease based on proximity. With this basic framework established, one can examine strategies that change the spread of the infection, such as social distancing.","Schuster, M. D.",Computing in Science & Engineering,411,16

By combining the filament with fibers from other materials including wood, metal, glass, and carbon, the method can easily be adapted to print complex parts using a variety of materials. However, despite its popularity, online print quality and machine monitoring continue to remain a challenge. Here, we present the preliminary results from our efforts on using cheap off-the-shelf sensors in combination with discrete wavelet transform analysis to identify the differences in the vibroacoustic signals measured near the print area during successful and failed first layer filament deposition on the build plate. A failure in creating a strong first layer bond between the extruded filament and the build plate always results in a print failure and is one of most common print issues occurring in FDM printing. By controlling the extruder and build plate temperatures, we control the filament – build plate bond strength while measuring the generated vibroacoustic signals using a PVDF piezo sensor. The measured signals are analyzed using a discrete wavelet transform to partition the signal energy into different energy levels. For the cases studied, we find that the relevant noticeable differences can be observed in specific energy levels during good and bad bond formation. Reconstructing the signal using these energy contributions provides a time domain representation of signal differences under different conditions. The obtained results demonstrate that a cheap and easy to implement method can be developed using PVDF sensors in combination with a wavelet-based signal analysis approach.","Bhavsar, Pavan; Sharma, Bhisham; Moscoso-Kingsley, Wilfredo; Madhavan, Vis",Procedia Manufacturing,411,20

Methods We performed a retrospective cohort study and a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies during the last 10 years to assess the sex differences in clinical and microbiological outcomes in tuberculosis. Results In our cohort of 2,894 patients with drug-susceptible pulmonary TB (1,975 males and 919 females), males had higher adjusted hazards of mortality due to all causes (HR 1.43,95%CI 1.03-1.98) and infections (HR 1.70, 95%CI 1.09-2.64) at 9 months and higher adjusted odds ratio for sputum culture (OR 1.56,95%CI 1.05-2.33) and similar odds ratio for smear positivity (OR 1.27, 0.71-2.27) at 2 months compared to females. Among 7896 articles retrieved, 398 articles were included in our systematic review with a total of 3,957,216 patients.

There is thus a pressing need to develop next-generation vaccine strategies to provide more broad and long-lasting protection. By using adenoviral vectors (Ad) of human and chimpanzee origin, we developed Ad-vectored trivalent COVID-19 vaccines expressing Spike-1, Nucleocapsid and RdRp antigens and evaluated them following single-dose intramuscular or intranasal immunization in murine models. We show that respiratory mucosal immunization, particularly with chimpanzee Ad-vectored vaccine, is superior to intramuscular immunization in induction of the three-arm immunity, consisting of local and systemic antibody responses, mucosal tissue-resident memory T cells, and mucosal trained innate immunity. We further show that single-dose intranasal immunization provides robust protection against not only the ancestral strain of SARS-CoV-2, but also two emerging VOC, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. Our findings indicate that single-dose respiratory mucosal delivery of an Ad-vectored multivalent vaccine represents an effective next-generation COVID-19 vaccine strategy against current and future VOC. This strategy has great potential to be used not only to boost first-generation vaccine-induced immunity but also to expand the breadth of protective T cell immunity at the respiratory mucosa.","Afkhami, Sam; D’Agostino, Michael R.; Zhang, Ali; Stacey, Hannah D.; Marzok, Art; Kang, Alisha; Singh, Ramandeep; Bavananthasivam, Jegarubee; Ye, Gluke; Luo, Xiangqian; Wang, Fuan; Ang, Jann C.; Zganiacz, Anna; Sankar, Uma; Kazhdan, Natallia; Koenig, Joshua F.

In this manuscript, we propose an automated single cell proteomics data annotation approach called ProtAnno to facilitate cell type assignments without laborious manual gating. ProtAnno is designed to incorporate information from annotated single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), CITE-seq, and prior data knowledge (which can be imprecise) on biomarkers for different cell types. We have performed extensive simulations to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of ProtAnno. For several single cell proteomics datasets that have been manually labeled, ProtAnno was able to correctly label most single cells. In summary, ProtAnno offers an accurate and robust tool to automate cell type annotations for large single cell proteomics datasets, and the analysis of such annotated cell types can offer valuable biological insights.","Deng, Wenxuan; Zhu, Biqing; Park, Seyoung; Sumida, Tomokazu S.; Unterman, Avraham; Hafler, David; Cruz, Charles S.

Addressing these challenges required new forms of collaborative groups.To support the department community and the rapid sharing of new research, educational, clinical, and personal efforts, a Core Team from the Department of Learning Health Sciences at the University of Michigan developed a meeting series called the COVID Conversations. This Experience Report shares the organizational structure of the COVID Conversations, proposes a comparison to traditional Learning Communities, and reports the results of a questionnaire that gathered details about department members' COVID‐related activities.We identify and describe salient similarities and differences between the COVID Conversations and the characteristics of Learning Communities. We also developed and piloted a taxonomy for characterizing LHS research projects that may be further developed for use in Learning Community planning, in conjunction with other maturity grids and ontologies. We propose the term “Meta‐Learning Community” to describe the structure and function of the COVID Conversations.In academic medicine, remote work, telemedicine, and virtual learning may be here to stay. The COVID Conversations constitute a distinct and innovative form of collaborative work in which separate teams addressing distinct goals, yet sharing a common passion to tackle the issues brought by the pandemic, are able to share experiences and learn from one other.

The ENT block internship at the University Hospital Dresden was offered fully digital for the first time in summer semester 2020. The focus was on teaching and assessing psychomotor skills of ENT mirror examination. Methods 241 students were provided with a digital script, instructional videos about the standardized ENT mirror examination and a disposable ENT instrument set. 188 students also received a one-hour real-time teleteaching session with an ENT physician. 53 students received no teleteaching. The students had to submit a video of their standardized mirror examination and specify their individual practice time. The videos were evaluated using a checklist-based assessment (maximum 100 points). Results The average total score of all students is 86,1±0,09. Students with teleteaching achieve significantly (p=0,005) higher scores (87,0±0,09) than students without teleteaching (83±0,11). There is a positive and significant correlation between practice time and total score in the group with teleteaching. Conclusion Real-time teleteaching (digital presence teaching) has a significant influence on the psychomotor learning curves of students. A checklist-based evaluation is indispensable for establishing a digital assessment of psychomotor skills and for creating comparability between analog and digital teaching. Previous analyses showed that after the analog mirror course with 6 teaching units (45 min each) an average of 95.4 points was achieved. The total score achieved in digital teaching (86.1±0.09) is comparable to the score after 4 analog lessons (45 min each).","Lakner, T.; Polk, M.

They must focus on innovative teaching for the undergraduate (UG) medical students to make them sensitive to the social and contextual determinants of health to achieve the health for all goal. The early introduction of community-based medical education could be a game changing strategy. Objectives- To describe the methods, evaluation, implication, and challenges of a Community Orientation Programme (COP) adopted for the Indian Medical Graduates (IMG). Methods: The COP was arranged for the first-year UG students, including the community and the local administration. The program was divided into phases like- initial preparation, theoretical sessions, field visits, group activities, data analysis, and dissemination of the findings. In this learner-centric, supervised educational program, the key aim was to focus on developing students communication skills, observation power and enhancing their motivation for learning new things through collaborative learning. A mixture of adult learning theories like behaviorism, cognitivism, constructivism, sociocultural theory, critical theory, and humanism included keeping the students needs, cultural differences, and varying motivational levels. A structured feedback mechanism from the students was developed to identify the gaps. Conclusion- The COP has provided a holistic learning framework for the students based on several complementary learning theories in the Indian context. It has touched upon most of the national- and institutional-level objectives envisioned by the regulatory body for the IMGs.

Did the increased attention to the use of absentee ballots in our elections encourage more people to participate absentee and support changes in Texas's election code to allow no‐excuse absentee voting?Four surveys of Texas voters were conducted in April, June, September, and October to track voter attitudes about absentee voting during the election.Voters who were uncomfortable voting in person were more likely to vote absentee and support new reforms. However, voters exposed to messages by elected officials who negatively portrayed the use of absentee voting were less likely to vote absentee during the pandemic and more likely to oppose new reforms.Despite the predicted effects of political information, the public's consideration of the health of others create a significant and lasting effect favoring the acceptance of expanding absentee ballots in a state with no‐excuse absentee voting.

Antibodies are powerful biotherapeutics to fight viral infections; however, discovery of the most potent and broadly acting clones can be lengthy. Here, we used the human apoferritin protomer as a modular subunit to drive oligomerization of antibody fragments and transform antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 into exceptionally potent neutralizers. Using this platform, half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values as low as 9 × 10−14 M were achieved as a result of up to 10,000-fold potency enhancements. Combination of three different antibody specificities and the fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain on a single multivalent molecule conferred the ability to overcome viral sequence variability together with outstanding potency and Ig-like in vivo bioavailability. This MULTi-specific, multi-Affinity antiBODY (Multabody; or MB) platform contributes a new class of medical countermeasures against COVID-19 and an efficient approach to rapidly deploy potent and broadly-acting therapeutics against infectious diseases of global health importance.

However, in the past months, concerns have increased about the fact the health emergency has put on hold during the pandemic many climate adaptation and mitigation policies. We focus our attention on understanding the role of the recent health emergency on the transmission of information related to climate change, jointly with other socio-economic variables, social norms, and cultural dimensions. In doing so, we create a unique dataset containing the number of tweets written with specific climate related keywords per country worldwide, as well as country specific socio-economic characteristics, relevant social norms, and cultural variables. We find that socio-economic variables, such as income, education, and other risk-related variables matter in the transmission of information about climate change and Twitter activity. We also find that the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly decreased the overall number of messages written about climate change, postponing the climate debate worldwide;but particularly in some vulnerable countries.

Design, setting, participants, and outcome measures A cross-sectional study was conducted between December 2020 and January 2021, involving 1382 respondents aged 18 years and above from all eight divisions in Bangladesh. We used multiple linear regression to identify sociodemographic predictors of risk perception and multiple logistic regression to determine the relationship between risk perception and preventive practice. Results Low risk perception regarding COVID-19 was present among one-fifth of the respondents (19.8%). Younger age, being male, low education, single marital status, and rural residence were significantly associated with a low perceived risk of COVID-19. Hand washing and wearing mask were practiced by 80% and 67% of respondents, respectively. A low prevalence was noticed for social distancing (31%), avoiding social gathering (31%), and covering face while coughing/sneezing (18%). Furthermore, respondents with a high risk perception were found to be more likely than those with a low risk perception to practice all recommended COVID-19 preventive behaviors- hand washing (OR=2.4, 95% CI=1.5, 3.7), mask use (OR=3.4, 95% CI=2.3, 5), social distancing (OR=3.7, 95% CI=2.4, 5.6), sanitizer use (OR=2.7, 95% CI=1.8, 4.1), avoiding gathering (OR=2.3, 95% CI=1.6, 3.5), avoid touching face and mouth (OR=2.8, 95% CI=1.5, 5.3), and covering mouth while coughing/sneezing (OR=7, 95% CI=3.6, 13.4). Conclusion Considerable number of Bangladeshi adults had low risk perception and low practice of some vital COVID-19 preventive behaviors before the onset of second wave of corona. All preventive practices were also influenced by risk perception. This highlights the importance of strengthening and optimizing risk communication strategy even when the number of corona cases are low.","Rahman, F. N.; Rahman, A. F.; Hossain, S. M.; Faiz, M.

Of these, 114 were Holocaust survivors and 191 did not experience the Holocaust. Participants were asked about their worries of COVID-19 infections, will to live, loneliness and depression and how these changed during the COVID-19 pandemic.ResultsHolocaust survivors were worried to a greater extent from COVID-19 infection and from close others becoming infected, compared to older adults who did not experience the Holocaust. Moreover, survivors reported greater loneliness and depression overall and also reported that these measures became worse during the pandemic.

Increasingly, K. pneumoniae has become a public health concern due to its rate of nosocomial infection and emerging, broad-spectrum antibiotic resistance. The nuclear receptor NR4A1 exhibits functionality in a multitude of organ systems and is implicated as having a role in the immune response to bacterial infection, though its role in K. pneumoniae infection is unknown. To determine if Nr4a1 functions in response to K. pneumoniae pulmonary disease, we infected wild-type and Nr4a1−/− mice with K. pneumoniae and assessed bacterial growth, immune cell recruitment and function, and cytokine production. We found that Nr4a1−/− mice had increased bacterial burden in the lungs and spleen, though no differences in cell recruitment. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, Il1β and Il6, as well as chemokine, Cxcl2, were significantly decreased in the BAL fluid cells of Nr4a1−/− mice 5 hours post-infection. Additionally, Nr4a1−/− mice had reduced IL-1β and myeloperoxidase protein production. We then examined the bactericidal function of macrophages and neutrophils from WT and Nr4a1−/− mice. We identified that Nr4a1−/− neutrophils had decreased bactericidal function compared to wild-type neutrophils, which was associated with reduced expression of Il1β, Lcn2, Mpo, and Lyz2.

The three species that have so far been implicated, a viverrid, a mustelid and a canid, are part of a large suite of small carnivores distributed across this region currently overexploited by this international wildlife trade. A major lesson from SARS is that the underlying roots of newly emergent zoonotic diseases may lie in the parallel biodiversity crisis of massive species loss as a result of overexploitation of wild animal populations and the destruction of their natural habitats by increasing human populations.

Several gene 1 proteins have been shown to localize at sites of viral RNA synthesis in the infected cell cytoplasm, notably on late endosomes at early times of infection. However, both immunofluorescence and electron microscopic studies have also detected gene 1 proteins at sites distinct from the putative sites of viral RNA synthesis or virus assembly. In this study, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-infected cells were fractionated and analyzed to determine if gene 1 proteins segregated to more than one membrane population. Following differential centrifugation of lysates of MHV-infected DBT cells, gene 1 proteins as well as the structural N and M proteins were detected almost exclusively in a high-speed small membrane pellet. Following fractionation of the small membrane pellet on an iodixanol density gradient, the gene 1 proteins p28 and helicase cofractionated with dense membranes (1.12 to 1.13 g/ml) that also contained peak concentrations of N. In contrast, p65 and p1a-22 were detected in a distinct population of less dense membranes (1.05 to 1.09 g/ml). Viral RNA was detected in membrane fractions containing helicase, p28, and N but not in the fractions containing p65 and p1a-22. LAMP-1, a marker for late endosomes and lysosomes, was detected in both membrane populations. These results demonstrate that multiple gene 1 proteins segregate into two biochemically distinct but tightly associated membrane populations and that only one of these populations appears to be a site for viral RNA synthesis. The results further suggest that p28 is a component of the viral replication complex whereas the gene 1 proteins p1a-22 and p65 may serve roles during infection that are distinct from viral RNA transcription or replication.","Sims, A C; Ostermann, J; Denison, M R",Journal of virology,411,1

To efficiently detect numerous viruses in a large epidemiologic study, we developed a fast, multitarget, sensitive, and specific assay named the Respiratory MultiCode-PLx Assay (RMA). The RMA utilizes improved multiplex PCR chemistry (EraGen MultiCode-PLx technology) coupled with high-throughput microsphere flow cytometry (Luminex). Eighteen sets of virus-specific multiplex PCR primers were developed based on the conserved sequences of all available respiratory-virus sequences for eight distinct groups: human rhinovirus (HRV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), influenza virus (InfV), metapneumovirus, adenovirus (Ad), coronavirus, and enterovirus. Each primer set detected 20 cDNA copies of the intended target per sample and had no reaction with 60,000 copies of human genomic DNA. The accuracy and sensitivity of the RMA for detecting respiratory viruses in human samples were tested with two sets of clinical specimens. First, 101 nasal-wash specimens that were positive for HRV, RSV, InfV, PIV, or Ad by traditional techniques were reanalyzed by RMA, and all target viruses were detected with an overall sensitivity of 94% and specificity of 99%. Second, 103 nasal-wash samples from 5-year-old children with asthma and respiratory symptoms were analyzed; RMA detected viruses in 74 specimens (71.8%) compared to only 24 (23.3%) by traditional culture and immunofluorescent-staining techniques. These results show that RMA is an accurate, sensitive, and practical test for respiratory-virus infections.","Lee, Wai-Ming; Grindle, Kris; Pappas, Tressa; Marshall, David J; Moser, Michael J; Beaty, Edward L; Shult, Peter A; Prudent, James R; Gern, James E",Journal of clinical microbiology,411,8

An outpatient follow-up plan was developed for COVID-19 patients with stable clinical condition and no concomitant diseases. The records of COVID-19 first admission clinic were retrospectively reviewed to identify the COVID-19 patients who were followed on home isolation as outpatients between March 17, 2020 and April 18, 2020 in Ankara, Turkey. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients, compliance with isolation rules, re-admission rates, and outcomes were investigated. A total of 41 patients with COVID-19 were followed on home isolation without hospitalization. The median age of the patients was 36 years. Twenty-four (58.5%) of 41 patients were female. Twenty-nine (70.7%) patients were healthcare workers. The most common symptoms at admission were cough, myalgia/arthralgia, and loss of smell and/or taste. Fourteen (34.1%) patients were asymptomatic on the first admission. Anti-viral treatment was given to 27 (65.8%) of 41 patients. Four of 41 patients were readmitted to the outpatient clinic and hospitalized. Three patients had worsening respiratory symptoms and pneumonia was detected in CT scans. One patient was hospitalized because of disseminated herpes zoster infection. Two patients who jeopardized the isolation rules were isolated and monitored at another hospital by provincial health directorate teams. If adequate conditions are provided, follow-up on home isolation seems to be a feasible method in carefully selected patients. However, these patients should be monitored closely by an experienced team during the isolation period.","Ayaz, Caglayan Merve; Dizman, Gulcin Telli; Metan, Gokhan; Alp, Alpaslan; Unal, Serhat",Le infezioni in medicina,411,17

This is an active process involving at least three PRV gene products that act in an allele-specific manner such that cell surface expression of MHC class I Dk is decreased and that of Kk is increased. Our results indicate that an early gene product mediates the overall reduction in Dk protein and a late gene product which is mutant in the attenuated PRV strain Bartha mediates the increase in Kk protein. We provide additional evidence for a third gene product involved in the regulation of the synthesis of both the Dk and Kk proteins. In addition, we show that the early decrease in the Dk protein is not due to a block in synthesis or processing of the complex through the secretory system.","Sparks-Thissen, R L; Enquist, L W",Journal of virology,411,15

It is particularly useful for employers to know how many employees have already contracted the infection and for how many people are still at risk of the coronavirus infection. For this purpose, it is appropriate to examine IgG antibodies. However, the testing strategy is different at present - antigen testing is mandatory to look for infectious individuals, regardless of human immunity. The aim of the pilot study was to determine the number of immune individuals after infection at three clinics of GENNET s.r.o. At the same time, unvaccinated individuals who had not had COVID-19 or had undergone it more than three months ago were tested with antigen tests. The cohort included 297 subjects, of whom 182 were not vaccinated (61.3 %) and 115 subjects (38.7 %) were after the vaccination. Of the unvaccinated, 71 people had in the past a positive PCR test (39 %), another 18 people had positive IgG antibodies without infection (9.9 %) and 38 people (20.9 %) had negative IgG antibodies. So far, 55 persons (30.2 %) have not been examined. If we add people vaccinated and people with antibodies, then 74.3 % of employees of the GENNET Archa clinic, 68 % of employees from the GENNET Kostelní clinic and 58.1 % from the GENNET Liberec clinic were immune to infection. 153 individuals on average (60 of whom had antibodies) were tested for the antigen test in four rounds. The infection was detected in two people. Both belonged to the group without tested antibodies. No person with antibodies was tested positive for antigen. People who have antibodies after vaccination or infection are substantially less prone to infection and have a low risk of continuing to spread the virus. By examining antibodies, employers will gain a better overview of the situation in the workplace. Based on our study, we recommend including antibody testing into antiepidemic measures and limit antigen testing to seronegative individuals.","Krátká, Zuzana; Sedláčková, Lenka; Luxová, Štěpánka; Hrubá, Dana; Katina, Stanislav",Casopis lekaru ceskych,411,11

This article records and reports concerns expressed by Canadian emergency and critical care nurses in terms of organizational and social supports required during infectious disease outbreaks. The nature of work-family and family-work conflict perceived and experienced by nurses during infectious disease outbreaks, as well as the supports needed to enable them to balance their social roles during this type of heightened stress, are explored. METHODS Five focus groups consisting of 100 nurses were conducted using a Structured Interview Matrix facilitation technique. RESULTS Four emergent themes included: (1) substantial personal/professional dilemmas; (2) assistance with child, elder, and/or pet care; (3) adequate resources and vaccinations to protect families; and (4) appropriate mechanisms to enable two-way communication between employees and their families under conditions of quarantine or long work hours. CONCLUSIONS Social and organizational supports are critical to help buffer the effects of stress for nurses and assist them in managing difficult role conflicts during infectious disease outbreaks. These supports are necessary to improve response capacity for bio-disasters.","O'Sullivan, Tracey L; Amaratunga, Carol; Phillips, Karen P; Corneil, Wayne; O'Connor, Eileen; Lemyre, Louise; Dow, Darcie",Prehospital and disaster medicine,411,16

It may advance to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis or cirrhosis. Ultrasonography has high sensitivity and specificity for detecting nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Objective Lack of sufficient information in this region on sonological prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, lead us to design the survey and may also serve as reference for further researches. Method This is a cross sectional study with 600 participants, conducted at Gandaki Medical College Teaching Hospital, Province 4 of Nepal, from September to October 2017. Ethical approval is taken from the Institutional review board. The study group includes the participants referred for abdominal sonography from outpatient department. Result In present survey, 367 (61.2%) are female and 233 (38.8%) are male participants. The mean age is 41.6 years and median age is 38 years. The prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver in our observation is 229 cases (38.2%) of which, 102 cases (44.5%) are male and 127 cases (55.4%) are female participants. Normal liver was seen in 61.8%, Grade one fatty liver was discovered in 24.8%, Grade one in 12.6% and Grade three in 0.6%. The mean liver size in those with fatty liver was 14.1 cm. Conclusion Province 4 of Nepal is not exempt from the growing epidemic of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease with prevalence of 38.2%. The study shows that with higher grades of fatty liver, the size of liver is also increased and the mean age of the participants involved is also in the higher side of the spectrum.","Shrestha, M K; Ghartimagar, D; Jhunjhunwala, A K; Thapa, M",Kathmandu University medical journal,411,16

Health care staff has been advised to change working routines to keep themselves and their patients safe. Radionuclide therapy has had an increasing role in clinical practice. Most therapeutic radionuclide procedures have applications in oncology. Cancer patients are an especially fragile and vulnerable population with higher risk due to co morbidities and immunosuppression. COVID-19 is another risk that must be considered in treatment planning. Therapeutic, prophylactic, and supportive interventions may require changes for these patients. The most common radionuclide therapies involve patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) who need radioiodine therapy (RAI), patients with neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) who need peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT), patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who need therapy with radiolabelled microspheres, and patients with prostate cancer and bone metastasis who need radionuclide palliative therapy. If infected, cancer patients could be at a higher risk for serious COVID-19 disease. Treatment decisions for thyroid cancer and NETs are challenging in this environment. Any decision to postpone therapy must be carefully considered, balancing risks and benefits. A risk of worsened prognosis due to delayed or suboptimal cancer treatment must be weighed against the risk of severe COVID-19 illness.","Koukouraki, S; Kapsoritakis, N; Bourogianni, O",Hellenic journal of nuclear medicine,411,16

The goal is to help inform the many healthcare professionals working with COVID-19 patients. A literature search was performed on PubMed, Scopus, and EMBASE databases. Hand searches were also undertaken using Google and reference lists to identify recent evidence. Studies were critically appraised, and the findings were analyzed by narrative synthesis. Nutritional status can impact immunity in several ways, including affecting susceptibility to infection, severity of disease, and recovery time, and is therefore a significant consideration in the management of COVID-19. COVID-19 can also impact digestive function, which can further impact nutritional status. The role of Vitamin D deficiency in vulnerability to severe respiratory infections, including COVID-19, has been recognized, and it may have a role in treatment where deficiency is indicated. Healthcare professionals should be aware that obesity may be accompanied by micronutrient malnutrition including vitamin D deficiency and alterations in the microbiome and inflammatory responses, which can further impact immunity and disease severity. Multidisciplinary team-work is recommended in the management of patients with COVID-19, and approaches should include a consideration of nutritional status (both macronutrients and micronutrients), body weight, and gastrointestinal signs and symptom.","Bold, Justine; Harris, Miranda; Fellows, Lindsey; Chouchane, Manal",Gastroenterology and hepatology from bed to bench,411,16

We previously showed that Ceacam1a(-/-) mice are completely resistant to MHV-A59 infection (E. Hemmila et al., J. Virol. 78:10156-10165, 2004). In vitro, MHV-JHM, but not MHV-A59, can spread from infected murine cells to cells that lack mCEACAM1a, a phenomenon called receptor-independent spread. To determine whether MHV-JHM could infect and spread in the brain independent of mCEACAM1a, we inoculated Ceacam1a(-/-) mice. Although Ceacam1a(-/-) mice were completely resistant to i.c. inoculation with 10(6) PFU of recombinant wild-type MHV-A59 (RA59) virus, these mice were killed by recombinant MHV-JHM (RJHM) and a chimeric virus containing the spike of MHV-JHM in the MHV-A59 genome (SJHM/RA59). Immunohistochemistry showed that RJHM and SJHM/RA59 infected all neural cell types and induced severe microgliosis in both Ceacam1a(-/-) and wild-type mice. For RJHM, the 50% lethal dose (LD(50)) is <10(1.3) in wild-type mice and 10(3.1) in Ceacam1a(-/-) mice. For SJHM/RA59, the LD(50) is <10(1.3) in wild-type mice and 10(3.6) in Ceacam1a(-/-) mice. This study shows that infection and spread of MHV-JHM in the brain are dependent upon the viral spike glycoprotein. RJHM can initiate infection in the brains of Ceacam1a(-/-) mice, but expression of mCEACAM1a increases susceptibility to infection. The spread of infection in the brain is mCEACAM1a independent. Thus, the ability of the MHV-JHM spike to mediate mCEACAM1a-independent spread in the brain is likely an important factor in the severe neurovirulence of MHV-JHM in wild-type mice.","Miura, Tanya A; Travanty, Emily A; Oko, Lauren; Bielefeldt-Ohmann, Helle; Weiss, Susan R; Beauchemin, Nicole; Holmes, Kathryn V",Journal of virology,411,20

The presence of waterborne enteric pathogens (bacteria, viruses, and protozoa) in domestic water supplies represents a potentially significant human health risk. Even though major outbreaks of waterborne disease are comparatively rare, there is substantial evidence that human enteric pathogens that are frequently present in domestic water supplies are responsible for low-level incidence of waterborne microbial disease. Although these diseases are rarely debilitating to healthy adults for more than a few hours to a few days, enteric pathogens can cause severe illness, even death, for young children, the elderly, or those with compromised immune systems. As the epidemiology of waterborne diseases is changing, there is a growing global public health concern about new and reemerging infectious diseases that are occurring through a complex interaction of social, economic, evolutionary, and ecological factors. New microbial pathogens have emerged, and some have spread worldwide. Alternative testing strategies for waterborne diseases should significantly improve the ability to detect and control the causative pathogenic agents.

During viral pandemics, the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advise the application of airborne precautions when performing aerosol-generating medical procedures, such as aerosolized medications. Observations Appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), including fit-tested particulate respirators should be worn when administering nebulized medications to patients. These PPEs have been in short supply in the US during early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is increasing the risk faced by health care workers (HCWs) who are treating patients using aerosolized medications. Despite taking appropriate precautions, HCWs are becoming infected with COVID-19. This may be related to secondary exposure related to viral longevity in fugitive emissions and viability on fomites. Conclusions We have expanded on non-US public health recommendations to provide guidance to frontline HCWs to enhance collaboration between clinicians, who are often siloed in their clinical practices, and ultimately to protect the federal workforce, which cannot sustain a significant loss of frontline HCWs.","Benge, Cassandra D; Barwise, John Alan","Federal practitioner : for the health care professionals of the VA, DoD, and PHS",411,24

Due to Republican leadership’s initial downplaying of COVID-19 and the resulting partisan media coverage, we predicted that conservatives would perceive it as less threatening. Two preregistered online studies supported this prediction. Conservatism was associated with perceiving less personal vulnerability to the virus and the virus’s severity as lower, and stronger endorsement of the beliefs that the media had exaggerated the virus’s impact and that the spread of the virus was a conspiracy. Conservatism also predicted less accurate discernment between real and fake COVID-19 headlines and fewer accurate responses to COVID-19 knowledge questions. Path analyses suggested that presidential approval, knowledge about COVID-19, and news discernment mediated the relationship between ideology and perceived vulnerability. These results suggest that the relationship between political ideology and threat perceptions may depend on issue framing by political leadership and media.","Calvillo, Dustin P.; Ross, Bryan J.; Garcia, Ryan J.

METHODS: In this phase 2, randomized, open-label study, adult subjects aged &#8805;18 years with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 with moderate symptoms were randomized in a 1:1 to receive PEG IFN-&#945;2b plus SOC, or SOC alone. The primary endpoint was improvement in clinical status on day 15, measured by the WHO 7-point ordinal scale. RESULTS: Forty subjects were randomized to PEG IFN-&#945;2b plus SOC (n = 20) and SOC (n = 20). Overall, 19 (95.00%) subjects in PEG IFN-&#945;2b plus SOC had achieved clinical improvement on day 15 compared to 13 (68.42%) subjects in SOC (p < 0.05). Overall, 80% and 95% of subjects in the PEG IFN-&#945;2b plus SOC group had a negative RT-PCR result on day 7 and day 14, respectively, compared to 63% and 68% in the SOC group. Adverse events (AEs) were reported for eleven subjects in the PEG IFN-&#945;2b plus SOC group and eight subjects in the SOC group. All reported AEs were mild. CONCLUSION: The significant improvement in clinical status on day 15 is likely due to faster viral reduction compared to SOC with the PEG IFN-&#945;2b treated moderate COVID-19 subjects showing a difference as early as day seven and becoming significant by day 14.","Pandit, Anuja; Bhalani, Nirav; Bhushan, B L Shashi; Koradia, Parshottam; Gargiya, Shweta; Bhomia, Vinay; Kansagra, Kevinkumar",Int J Infect Dis,411,26

A multidisciplinary team-based strategy is necessary to adapt guidelines and medical practices to the actual situation. The aim of this study is to evaluate the changes in the therapeutic algorithm in a small group of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) enlisted for surgery during the COVID-19 outbreak. Materials and Methods: A multidisciplinary strategy has been adopted to allocate HCC patients to a treatment that permitted to reduce the risk of complications and the hospital stay, thus preventing contamination by the virus. Nasopharyngeal swab and a chest radiograph were performed in all patients within 48 hours before the surgical procedure: in the suspected cases with negative COVID tests, we prudently postponed surgery and repeated the diagnostic tests after 15 days. Results: During the emergency state, 11 HCC patients were treated (8 laparoscopic ablations and 3 hepatic resections). We reported only 1 postoperative complication (hemothorax) and 1 death during the follow-up for COVID pneumonia. Comparing our performances with those in the same time frame in the past 4 years, we treated a similar number of HCC patients, obtaining a decrease in operative timing (P = .0409) and hospital stay (P = .0412) (Fig. 2b) with similar rates of immediate postoperative complications, without ICU admissions. [Figure: see text] Conclusions: An adapted algorithm for the treatment of HCC to COVID outbreak permitted to manage safely these patients by identifying those most at risk of evolution of the neoplastic disease.","Santambrogio, Roberto; Farina, Gabriella; D039,; Alessandro, Valentina; Iacob, Giulio; Gemma, Marco; Zappa, Marco Antonio","J. laparoendosc. adv. surg. tech., Part A",411,1

Methods: Observational studies in COVID-19 patients reporting data on raised body mass index at admission and associated clinical outcomes were identified from MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library up to 16 May 2020. Mean differences and relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were aggregated using random effects models. Results: Eight retrospective cohort studies and one cohort prospective cohort study with data on of 4,920 patients with COVID-19 were eligible. Comparing BMI &#8805; 25 vs <25 kg/m2, the RRs (95% CIs) of severe illness and mortality were 2.35 (1.43-3.86) and 3.52 (1.32-9.42), respectively. In a pooled analysis of three studies, the RR (95% CI) of severe illness comparing BMI > 35 vs <25 kg/m2 was 7.04 (2.72-18.20). High levels of statistical heterogeneity were partly explained by age; BMI &#8805; 25 kg/m2 was associated with an increased risk of severe illness in older age groups (&#8805;60 years), whereas the association was weaker in younger age groups (<60 years). Conclusions: Excess adiposity is a risk factor for severe disease and mortality in people with SARS-CoV-2 infection. This was particularly pronounced in people 60 and older. The increased risk of worse outcomes from SARS-CoV-2 infection in people with excess adiposity should be taken into account when considering individual and population risks and when deciding on which groups to target for public health messaging on prevention and detection measures.

While there is strong support for testing symptomatic patients. The benefit of routine testing of asymptomatic patients remains contentious. We aim to evaluate the prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection in cancer patients. METHODS: Between June 1 and September 3, 2020, we obtained nasopharyngeal swab from asymptomatic cancer patients who were visiting a single tertiary-care cancer center, and tested the specimen for the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. We performed a descriptive statistic of data RESULTS: We tested a total of 80 patients, of which 3 (3.75%) were found positive for COVID-19. A significant proportion of the tested patients were on active immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory treatment, cytotoxic chemotherapy (nâ¯=â¯34), and immunotherapy (nâ¯=â¯16). However, all three COVID-19 positive patients were only actively on hormonal therapy. All three patients observed a minimum of 2 weeks home quarantine. None of the patients developed symptoms upon follow up and no changes were required to their treatment plan. CONCLUSIONS: Despite published evidence that cancer patients may be at increased risk of severe COVID -19 infection, our data suggest that some infected cancer patients are asymptomatic. The overall prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection in this population of cancer patients was similar to that in the general population. Therefore, since asymptomatic infections are not uncommon in patients with cancer, we recommend universal COVID-19 testing to help guide treatment decisions and prevent the spread of the disease.","Ibrahim, Mudathir; Natarajan, Vijaya; Murthy, Pooja; Meghal, Trishala; Xu, Yiquing; Wiesel, Ory",Cancer Treat Res Commun,411,21

About 10 % of these HW are traded through a world-wide waste web (W4). The volume of HW traded through the W4 in the last 30 years has grown by 500 % and will continue to grow, creating serious legal, economic, environmental and health problems at global scale. Here we investigate the tip of the iceberg of the W4 by studying networks of 108 categories of wastes traded among 163 countries in the period 2003-2009. Although, most of the HW were traded between developed nations, a disproportionate asymmetry existed in the flow of waste from developed to developing countries. Using a dynamical model we simulate how waste congestion propagates through the W4. We identify 32 countries with poor environmental performance which are at high risk of waste congestion. Therefore, they are a threat of improper handling and disposal of HW. We found contamination by heavy metals (HM), by volatile organic compounds (VOC) and/or by persistent organic pollutants (POP), which were used as chemical fingerprints (CF) of the improper handling of HW in 94 % of these countries.","Mart'inez, Johann H.; Estrada, Ernesto",,411,6

The development of a COVID-19 vaccine to combat the disease's spread and devastating effects is still ongoing, and as the pandemic progresses, new, more effective vaccines are likely to be created. The aim of this study was to assess awareness and attitude towards COVID-19 vaccination in Ethiopia. Methods: A population-based cross-sectional e-survey was conducted among 425 participants from March 13, 2021 to April 10, 2021. The survey was conducted using a structured and self-reported questionnaire containing informed consent along with three sections (socio-demographic, awareness, and attitude);a multivariable logistic regression model was performed to determine the variables predicting awareness towards COVID-19 vaccinations. Results: The mean score of awareness was 4.3 (SD=1.1) out of 7, with the overall awareness of 40.8%, and the mean score of attitudes was 4.09 (SD=2.16) out of 9, with an overall ""positive attitude"" score of 24.2%.

We assessed the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a viral vectored coronavirus vaccine that expresses the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We did a phase 1/2, single-blind, randomised controlled trial in five trial sites in the UK of a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein compared with a meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY) as control. Healthy adults aged 18-55 years with no history of laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or of COVID-19-like symptoms were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 at a dose of 5â×â1010 viral particles or MenACWY as a single intramuscular injection. A protocol amendment in two of the five sites allowed prophylactic paracetamol to be administered before vaccination. Ten participants assigned to a non-randomised, unblinded ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 prime-boost group received a two-dose schedule, with the booster vaccine administered 28 days after the first dose. Humoral responses at baseline and following vaccination were assessed using a standardised total IgG ELISA against trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, a muliplexed immunoassay, three live SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation assays (a 50% plaque reduction neutralisation assay [PRNT50]; a microneutralisation assay [MNA50, MNA80, and MNA90]; and Marburg VN), and a pseudovirus neutralisation assay. Cellular responses were assessed using an ex-vivo interferon-Î³ enzyme-linked immunospot assay. The co-primary outcomes are to assess efficacy, as measured by cases of symptomatic virologically confirmed COVID-19, and safety, as measured by the occurrence of serious adverse events. Analyses were done by group allocation in participants who received the vaccine. Safety was assessed over 28 days after vaccination. Here, we report the preliminary findings on safety, reactogenicity, and cellular and humoral immune responses. The study is ongoing, and was registered at ISRCTN, 15281137, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04324606. FINDINGS: Between April 23 and May 21, 2020, 1077 participants were enrolled and assigned to receive either ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (n=543) or MenACWY (n=534), ten of whom were enrolled in the non-randomised ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 prime-boost group. Local and systemic reactions were more common in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group and many were reduced by use of prophylactic paracetamol, including pain, feeling feverish, chills, muscle ache, headache, and malaise (all p<0·05). There were no serious adverse events related to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. In the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group, spike-specific T-cell responses peaked on day 14 (median 856 spot-forming cells per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells, IQR 493-1802; n=43). Anti-spike IgG responses rose by day 28 (median 157 ELISA units [EU], 96-317; n=127), and were boosted following a second dose (639 EU, 360-792; n=10). Neutralising antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 32 (91%) of 35 participants after a single dose when measured in MNA80 and in 35 (100%) participants when measured in PRNT50. After a booster dose, all participants had neutralising activity (nine of nine in MNA80 at day 42 and ten of ten in Marburg VN on day 56). Neutralising antibody responses correlated strongly with antibody levels measured by ELISA (R2=0·67 by Marburg VN; p<0·001). INTERPRETATION: ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 showed an acceptable safety profile, and homologous boosting increased antibody responses. These results, together with the induction of both humoral and cellular immune responses, support large-scale evaluation of this candidate vaccine in an ongoing phase 3 programme.

Methods: Participants in a COVID-19 registrational study were provided the Obvio-19 app to use on their personal smartphones to report their COVID-19 symptoms and disease status daily. Results: There were 804 participants enrolled in this prospective observational study;47 participants were positive for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) or 5.8% of the study population. Participants’ used their smartphones consisting of 34.0% Android, 35.4% iOS, and 30.6% unidentified. Daily questionnaires (n=44,129) were completed and a subset (n=30) of participants have thus far provided feedback about their experience. Participants reported that using the app was “very easy” (4.66 + 0.75 on a 5-point scale with 5 as “very easy”) and responding to questions regarding their COVID-19 symptoms everyday was found to be “easily manageable” (4.79 + 0.67 on a 5-point scale with 5 as “easily manageable”). Overall, 97% of participants reported that it took less than 2 minutes to complete their electronic daily COVID-19 symptoms diaries. When asked if it was easier or harder to use the smartphone app versus paper to provide data on their symptoms, 93% of participants said that the app was easier, while the remaining 7% indicated that both experiences were about the same. Conclusions: To date, this study demonstrates that participants found it “very easy” and convenient to report on their COVID-19 symptoms using an app on their personal smartphone and that such technology provides an efficient and effective means of accurately and safely obtaining data directly from patients.","Dallabrida, S.; Linke, H.; Shah, P.; Culbreth-Notaro, M.",Value in Health,411,30

Society should continue to practice social distancing and masking in public despite aggressive vaccinations until achieving population immunity. However, the existing technology solutions, such as contact tracing apps and social-distancing devices, have been faced with suspicion due to privacy and accuracy concerns and have not been widely adopted. This paper proposes a novel infection management system named Crowd-based Alert and Tracing Services (CATS) to build a safe community cluster.

L'activité d'avis spécialisés est chronophage, non valorisée, et limitée par l'impossibilité d'échanger simplement les éléments du dossier médical. L'activité de recherche clinique est limitée par la fréquence des visites protocolaires. L'objectif de ce travail est de déterminer si la télémédecine (TLM) peut contribuer à résoudre ces difficultés. Concernant l'activité de recours, nous avons demandé aux médecins de déclarer les avis donnés à l'aide d'un formulaire standardisé, afin de déterminer s'ils validaient les critères de téléconsultation (TLC) ou de télé-expertise (TLE). Concernant l'activité de recherche, nous avons remis aux investigateurs et à 50 patients un questionnaire sur l'acceptabilité de TLC protocolaires. Concernant l'activité de recours, on dénombrait 120 avis (soit 21 h) hebdomadaires, dont 29 % aux patients et 69 % à des médecins. Soixante et un pour cent des avis aux patients validaient les critères de TLC ;18 % des avis aux médecins ceux de TLE. Concernant l'activité de recherche, 70 % des investigateurs considéraient la fréquence des visites comme limitant les inclusions ;près de la moitié des patients serait favorable au recours à des TLC à la place (40 %) ou en plus (56 %) des visites présentielles. En termes de facturation, la TLM représente un revenu potentiel de 300 € hebdomadaires pour le TLE et 616€ hebdomadaires pour le TLC. Si le recours à la TLM comme procédure dégradée au présentiel s'est démocratisé avec la pandémie, les solutions qu'elle apporte aux difficultés rencontrées dans les activités d'avis et de recherche peuvent contribuer à intégrer pleinement son usage dans le suivi standard des patients. Si tel était le cas, on pourrait tout à fait imaginer avec ce budget (47 632 €/an) pouvoir financer un praticien hospitalier supplémentaire à temps partiel.

Since medical imaging plays a significant part in the healthcare system and is often used in the diagnosis of potential COVID-19 patients, the radiology personnel are at a very high risk of becoming infected. PURPOSE: This study aims to assess the enforcement of infection control guidelines for patients with COVID-19 during medical imaging procedures and raise awareness of infection control in different hospitals in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: A total of 128 responses were collected from four hospitals across Saudi Arabia using a new structured questionnaire, which was created for health workers by the WHO specifically for this purpose. Data were collected during the COVID-19 pandemic in April 2020. RESULTS: Most participants correctly followed the guidelines of the WHO and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on infection control in the X-ray and general radiology departments. Guideline awareness was higher among magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerised tomography (CT) radiographers, which reduced the risk of future infections. Out of the total respondents, 98.4% stated that they had received formal training in hand hygiene. Only 40.6% of participants, however, knew that respiratory droplets are the primary mode of transmission of the virus from person to person. CONCLUSION: The knowledge of healthcare professionals in the radiology department regarding infection control needs to be continually assessed. A focus on educational interventions on infection control is required in order to maintain well-informed medical staff.","Almatari, M; Alghamdi, Ali; Alamri, Sultan; Otaibey, Mufeed; Alghamdi, Ahmad Joman; Alasmari, Azah; Alelyani, Magbool",,411,20

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the general medical complications have received the most attention, whereas only a few studies address the potential direct impact of SARS-CoV-2 on mental health. METHODS: A total of 321 maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients were selected using random sampling from the hemodialysis center of the second people's Hospital of Yibin. They completed Zung's self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) for anxiety, Zung's self-rating depression scale (SDS) for depression, and the activity of daily living scale (ADL) for the ability of living. Demographic data and laboratory tests were used to analyze the risk factors. RESULTS: The proportions of the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms were between 34.89% and 30.02%, respectively, among the MHD patients. The SAS and SDS scores of the 321 patients were 45.42(± 10.99) and 45.23(± 11.59), respectively. The results show that monthly income, medical insurance, vascular access, the duration of dialysis, complication, hemoglobin (HGB), immunoreactive parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and blood phosphorus (P) are factors that influence anxiety among patients (p < 0.05 for all). Vascular access, monthly income, medical insurance, complication, CRP, Alb, are factors that influence depression among patients (p < 0.05 for all). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that during the pandemic period, the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms among MHD patients increased. Some demographic and clinical variables were associated with it. We should, therefore, pay more attention to the patients' psychology, start targeted intervention to alleviate the patients' anxiety and further improve their quality of life.","Hao, Wen; Tang, Qianrong; Huang, Xiaoqin; Ao, Lina; Wang, Jing; Xie, Deqiong",Int. urol. nephrol,411,16

The objectives of this study were to observe the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on eating behavior and lifestyle of the Kurdish population in Iraqi Kurdistan. A structured cross-sectional study was conducted from 1st to 14th of June when the lockdown finished with three different sections. Section one (6 questions) included socio-demographic information section two (11 questions) composed of dietary behavior information including a) Mediterranean diet (MD) adherence using 14-scaled items with a MD screener tool ranging from 0 to 14 b) and sections three (12 questions) composed of lifestyle habit changes such as physical activity, sleeping behavior, and smoking habit. The total number of included respondents was 2,137. The results showed that 12.0% (256) of participants stated that their lifestyle was improved, whereas 50.9% (1,087) declared their lifestyle deteriorated. In particular, the frequency of physical activity was decreased (McNemar value = 60.53, p <.001) and sleeping hours were significantly increased during lockdown (McNemar value = 447.93, p <.001). Regarding eating habits, it was noticed that 29.3% and 14.3% felt that appetite increased and decreased, respectively. The appetite change during lockdown was significantly associated with age (p =.0001), gender (p =.001), city (p =.007), and BMI (p =.001). Similarly, 32.4% reported weight gain. In conclusion, this study is among the earliest studies showing the effect of COVID-19 on eating behavior and lifestyle changes.

Using multiple countries, data streams and methods, we estimated that, when unconstrained, European COVID-19 confirmed cases doubled on average every 3 days (range 2.2-4.3 days) and Italian hospital and intensive care unit admissions every 2-3 days; values that are significantly lower than the 5-7 days dominating the early published literature. Furthermore, we showed that the impact of physical distancing interventions was typically not seen until at least 9 days after implementation, during which time confirmed cases could grow eightfold. We argue that such temporal patterns are more critical than precise estimates of the time-insensitive basic reproduction number R0 for initiating interventions, and that the combination of fast growth and long detection delays explains the struggle in countries' outbreak response better than large values of R0 alone. One year on from first reporting these results, reproduction numbers continue to dominate the media and public discourse, but robust estimates of unconstrained growth remain essential for planning worst-case scenarios, and detection delays are still key in informing the relaxation and re-implementation of interventions.

Thus, continuous evaluation of the modelling studies is crucial. We investigated situations of virus importation in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) to assess effectiveness of a modelling study by Haider N et al. titled 'Passengers' destinations from China: low risk of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) transmission into Africa and South America'. We obtained epidemiological data of 2417 COVID-19 cases reported by 40 countries in SSA within 30 days of the first case confirmed in Nigeria on 27 February. Out of 442 cases which had travel history available, only one (0.2%) had a travel history to China. These findings underline the result of the model. However, the fact that there were numbers of imported cases from other regions shows the limits of the model. The limits could be attributed to the characteristics of the COVID-19 which is infectious even when the patients do not express any symptoms. Therefore, there is a profound need for all modelling researchers to take asymptomatic cases into account when they establish modelling studies.","Miyachi, T; Tanimoto, T; Kami, M",Epidemiol Infect,411,21

RT-PCR test is considered as one of the gold standards worldwide to confirm the presence of COVID-19 infection reliably. Radiological images can also be used for the same purpose to some extent. Easy and no contact acquisition of the radiological images makes it a suitable alternative and this work can help to locate and interpret some prominent features for the screening purpose. One major challenge of this domain is the absence of appropriately annotated ground truth data. Motivated from this, a novel unsupervised machine learning-based method called SUFMACS (SUperpixel based Fuzzy Memetic Advanced Cuckoo Search) is proposed to efficiently interpret and segment the COVID-19 radiological images. This approach adapts the superpixel approach to reduce a large amount of spatial information. The original cuckoo search approach is modified and the Luus-Jaakola heuristic method is incorporated with McCulloch's approach. This modified cuckoo search approach is used to optimize the fuzzy modified objective function. This objective function exploits the advantages of the superpixel. Both CT scan and X-ray images are investigated in detail. Both qualitative and quantitative outcomes are quite promising and prove the efficiency and the real-life applicability of the proposed approach.","Chakraborty, Shouvik; Mali, Kalyani",Expert Syst Appl,411,16

The objective of this study was to examine the psychological pathway through which public trust in the government is associated with mental and physical well-being. We collected cross-sectional data from 501 participants aged &#8805;18 years using an online panel. Public trust in the government was assessed as our exposure variable. We screened for psychological distress by combining the Patient Health Questionnaire and the General Anxiety Disorder scale. Physical well-being was examined using self-rated health. We further assessed the roles of risk perceptions. The author conducted a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Pearson's correlations, multivariable regressions, and mediation analyses (using the Preachers and Hayes' approach). Participants were 55.29% female, 67.86% Caucasian/white with a mean age of 32.44 ± 11.94 years. Public trust in the government regarding COVID-19 was negatively correlated with psychological distress (r = -0.20; p < 0.001) and positively associated with physical well-being (r = 0.13; p < 0.001). After adjusting for sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors, public trust remained negatively associated with psychological distress (ß = -0.19; 95% confidence intervals, [CI] -0.30, -0.09) and positively associated with physical well-being (ß = 0.26; 95% CI [0.16, -0.37]). Perceived self-efficacy to practice COVID-19 protective behavior partially mediated the relationship between public trust and psychological distress (13.07%); and physical well-being (28.02%). Perceived self-efficacy to protect self against COVID-19 infection can serve as a psychological pathway through which public trust may be associated with mental and physical health.","Olagoke, Ayokunle A; Olagoke, Olakanmi O; Hughes, Ashley M",Front Psychol,411,20

However, evidence suggests that immigrants in the United States do not access mental health services to the same extent as nonimmigrants. In particular, immigrant adolescents and young adults may have unique stressors related to their developmental stage, experiences in school and with peer groups, and shifting roles within family systems. This scoping review summarizes findings from published research studies and practitioner-focused gray literature about the mental health needs of immigrant communities in the United States. The review finds that specific mental health needs vary across factors like age, racial/ethnic group, immigration status, and place of residency. Findings also indicate that structural factors like immigration-related laws affect both access to mental health services and stressors in the overall environment for immigrants and their families. This review also explores models of community-level initiatives that utilize strengths-based approaches to promoting mental health and well-being among immigrant communities. Findings highlight the need for a better understanding of the mental health needs and current barriers to care among diverse immigrant populations, as immigration continues to play a major role in U.S. public policy and discourse. The COVID-19 pandemic taking place as this article goes to press in 2020 also raises questions regarding health equity and access for marginalized populations, including immigrants and their communities, and so these findings also indicate the need for further interdisciplinary research to assess intersections among the pandemic's many impacts, including those related to mental health and well-being.","Rodriguez, Darlene Xiomara; Hill, Jessica; McDaniel, Paul N",Health Promot Pract,411,21

Because ICDs have enabled more patients to live longer, they often succumb to noncardiac diseases and may be cared for by primary care physicians.

The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has complicated this issue and the need to discuss it because of practices that separate patients from loved ones and that modify the usual interactions of patients with doctors and nurses. We offer the following recommendations: (1) the management of ICDs at the end-of-life needs to be understood by all physicians who care for patients with ICDs; (2) discussions about deactivating the ICD should occur while patients have decision-making capacity and are clinically stable, beginning at the time of ICD implantation, then periodically at follow-up appointments, and certainly when a change in the patient's clinical status warrants a reconsideration of the goals of care; and (3) clinicians should compensate for the impediments to communication with patients and families associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, which includes patient isolation and restrictive visitor policies, by using devices that permit visual communication to reexamine goals of care, including defibrillator deactivation, in patients with ICDs who are expected to die.","Myers, Sarah E; Eastwood, Gregory L",J Am Board Fam Med,411,23

Literature on the impact on individuals with eating disorders is slowly emerging. While outpatient eating disorder services in Canada have attempted to transition to virtual care, guidelines related to optimal virtual care in this field are lacking. As such, the objective of our Canadian Consensus Panel was to develop clinical practice guidelines related to the provision of virtual care for children, adolescents, and emerging adults living with an eating disorder, as well as their caregivers, during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. METHODS: Using scoping review methodology (with literature in databases from 2000 to 2020 and grey literature from 2010 to 2020), the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system, the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation tool, and a panel of diverse stakeholders from across Canada, we developed high quality treatment guidelines that are focused on virtual interventions for children, adolescents, and emerging adults with eating disorders, and their caregivers. RESULTS: Strong recommendations were supported specifically in favour of in-person medical evaluation when necessary for children, adolescents, and emerging adults, and that equity-seeking groups and marginalized youth should be provided equal access to treatment. For children and adolescents, weak recommendations were supported for telehealth family-based treatment (FBT) and online guided parental self-help FBT. For emerging adults, internet cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT)-based guided self-help was strongly recommended. Weak recommendations for emerging adults included CBT-based group internet interventions as treatment adjuncts, internet-based relapse prevention Maudsley Model of Anorexia Nervosa Treatment for Adults (MANTRA) guided self-help, telehealth relapse prevention using MANTRA, and guided CBT-based smartphone apps as treatment adjuncts. For caregivers of children and adolescents, weak recommendations were supported for virtual parent meal support training, and moderated online caregiver forums and support groups. For caregivers of emerging adults, guided parental self-help CBT was strongly recommended, and unguided caregiver psychoeducation self-help was weakly recommended. CONCLUSIONS: Several gaps for future work were identified including the impact of sex, gender, race, and socioeconomic status on virtual care among children, adolescents, and emerging adults with eating disorders, as well as research on more intensive services, such as virtual day hospitals.","Couturier, Jennifer; Pellegrini, Danielle; Miller, Catherine; Bhatnagar, Neera; Boachie, Ahmed; Bourret, Kerry; Brouwers, Melissa; Coelho, Jennifer S; Dimitropoulos, Gina; Findlay, Sheri; Ford, Catherine; Geller, Josie; Grewal, Seena; Gusella, Joanne; Isserlin, Leanna; Jericho, Monique; Johnson, Natasha; Katzman, Debra K; Kimber, Melissa; Lafrance, Adele; Leclerc, Anick; Loewen, Rachel; Loewen, Techiya; McVey, Gail; Norris, Mark; Pilon, David; Preskow, Wendy; Spettigue, Wendy; Steinegger, Cathleen; Waite, Elizabeth; Webb, Cheryl",J Eat Disord,411,18

We aim to identify biomarkers of coagulation, endothelial function, and fibrinolysis that are associated with disease severity and may have prognostic potential. METHODS: We performed a single-center prospective study of 14 adult COVID-19(+) intensive care unit patients who were age- and sex-matched to 14 COVID-19(-) intensive care unit patients, and healthy controls. Daily blood draws, clinical data, and patient characteristics were collected. Baseline values for 10 biomarkers of interest were compared between the three groups, and visualized using Fisher's linear discriminant function. Linear repeated-measures mixed models were used to screen biomarkers for associations with mortality. Selected biomarkers were further explored and entered into an unsupervised longitudinal clustering machine learning algorithm to identify trends and targets that may be used for future predictive modelling efforts. RESULTS: Elevated D-dimer was the strongest contributor in distinguishing COVID-19 status; however, D-dimer was not associated with survival. Variable selection identified clot lysis time, and antigen levels of soluble thrombomodulin (sTM), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and plasminogen as biomarkers associated with death. Longitudinal multivariate k-means clustering on these biomarkers alone identified two clusters of COVID-19(+) patients: low (30%) and high (100%) mortality groups. Biomarker trajectories that characterized the high mortality cluster were higher clot lysis times (inhibited fibrinolysis), higher sTM and PAI-1 levels, and lower plasminogen levels.

Moreover, we currently lack a thorough understanding of the mechanisms of humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-24. Here we analyse a large panel of human monoclonal antibodies that target the spike (S) glycoprotein5, and identify several that exhibit potent neutralizing activity and fully block the receptor-binding domain of the S protein (SRBD) from interacting with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Using competition-binding, structural and functional studies, we show that the monoclonal antibodies can be clustered into classes that recognize distinct epitopes on the SRBD, as well as distinct conformational states of the S trimer. Two potently neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, COV2-2196 and COV2-2130, which recognize non-overlapping sites, bound simultaneously to the S protein and neutralized wild-type SARS-CoV-2 virus in a synergistic manner. In two mouse models of SARS-CoV-2 infection, passive transfer of COV2-2196, COV2-2130 or a combination of both of these antibodies protected mice from weight loss and reduced the viral burden and levels of inflammation in the lungs. In addition, passive transfer of either of two of the most potent ACE2-blocking monoclonal antibodies (COV2-2196 or COV2-2381) as monotherapy protected rhesus macaques from SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Pregnant women were categorised as 'at risk' requiring extra vigilance with behavioural guidelines. Their understanding and ability to adhere to recommendations was unknown. OBJECTIVES: To complete a behavioural analysis of the determinants of recommended social distancing behaviour in pregnant women, according to the 'capability, opportunity, motivation and behaviour' ('COM-B') model to inform the development of recommendations/materials to support pregnant women in understanding and adhering to behavioural guidelines. DESIGN: Qualitative interview study with pregnant women in the Bristol area (UK). METHODS: Semi-structured telephone/videoconference interviews were conducted following a topic guide informed by the COM-B model, transcribed verbatim and subjected to framework analysis. Infographic materials were iteratively produced with stakeholder consultation, to support pregnant women. RESULTS: Thirty-one women participated (selected for demographic range). Women reported adhering to social distancing recommendations and intended to continue. COM-B analysis identified gaps in understanding around risk, vulnerability, and the extent of required social distancing, as well as facilitators of social distancing behaviour (e.g. social support, motivation to stay safe, home environment/resources). Additional themes around detrimental mental health effects and changes to maternity healthcare from the social distancing measures were identified. Infographic resources (plus midwife report) addressing women's key concerns were produced and disseminated. CONCLUSIONS: The COM-B model provided useful details of determinants of pregnant women's adherence to social distancing behaviours. The confusion of what being 'at risk' meant and varying interpretation of what was expected indicates a need for greater clarity around categories and guidance. The loss of maternity care and negative mental health effects of social distancing suggest a growing area of unmet health needs to be addressed in future.","Anderson, Emma; Brigden, Amberly; Davies, Anna; Shepherd, Emily; Ingram, Jenny",BMC Public Health,411,24

Herein we sought to quantify the extent of tissue catabolism in similar patients. Study design: During acute peritoneal dialysis (PD) in COVID-AKI patients we measured urea Kt/V adequacy and calculated daily urea nitrogen generation rate while quantifying their daily protein intake. Setting and population: We did calculations in 8 COVID-AKI patients undergoing acute PD at the Mount Sinai Hospital in NYC. As a comparator we obtained urea kinetic parameters from our database of ambulatory patients on maintenance PD. Exposure or predictors: 8 COVID-AKI patients undergoing acute PD. Outcomes: Urea nitrogen generation rate in relation to daily protein intake. Analytical Approach: Urea nitrogen generation rate from urea kinetics was related to measured daily dietary protein intake in these patients and compared it to this relationship in ambulatory maintenance PD patients where both parameters were calculated from urea kinetics. Results: Urea nitrogen generation rate in AKI patients was 10.2 + 5g/day, which is >2 fold higher than stable outpatients on maintenance PD (4.7 + 3g/day), despite similar dietary protein intake (74.8 + 11g/day vs 67.2 + 29g/day, respectively). This strongly suggests endogenous protein breakdown, probably from muscle. Urea nitrogen generation rate in these AKI patients corresponds to 315g/day of ongoing muscle breakdown and cumulative 2.5kg muscle breakdown during the early course of AKI. Limitations: Small number of participants as well as assumptions in comparing Urea nitrogen generation rate with protein intake. Conclusions: In highly catabolic patients, an endogenous source of urea generation, such as muscle protein breakdown, seems to be the most likely explainable cause for our findings. This is the first study that we are aware of to quantify the degree of endogenous protein breakdown induced by COVID cytokine storm.","Uribarri, Jaime; El Shamy, Osama; Sharma, Shuchita; Winston, Jonathan",,411,26

We assessed, in an interim analysis, the efficacy of a carrageenan-based gel in reducing the risk of new detections of anal HPV among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (gbMSM). METHODS: The LIMIT-HPV study (Lubricant Investigation in Men to Inhibit Transmission of HPV Infection) is a phase IIb, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised controlled trial conducted in Montreal, Canada. gbMSM were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive a carrageenan-based or placebo gel. Participants were instructed to apply the gel to the anus, condom and/or partners' penis before and-as required-during receptive anal intercourse. Questionnaire data and anal samples were collected at 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. We estimated new detections of anal HPV infection(s) detected via Linear Array using Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Participants recruited from February 2016 to December 2019 were randomly assigned to the carrageenan (n=127) or placebo (n=128) arm. The efficacy and safety analyses included 201 and 210 participants. The median follow-up time was 7.6 months (range: 0-28.5) in the carrageenan group and 9.3 months (range: 0-40.7) in the placebo group. The HR for new detections was 1.21 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.70): 69.4% and 65.1% new detections of HPV in the carrageenan and placebo arms, respectively. More adverse events were reported in the carrageenan (59.8%) compared with the placebo (39.8%) arm. CONCLUSIONS: The interim analysis did not demonstrate a protective effect of carrageenan on the risk of new detections of anal HPV infection among gbMSM. Carrageenan gel use was associated with a higher proportion of adverse events. Given these findings and the (assumed) low probability that a beneficial effect would be found by the study's end, the trial was terminated as recommended by the Data Safety and Monitoring Board.

RESULTS: The cluster involved four generations, each of which was transmitted to the next generation during the incubation period. The time was 2-7 days, 6-7days, 3-8 days and 9 days prior to onset. As of March 11, the fourth-generation cases had no symptoms. Combined with the epidemiological data, we inferred that the source of the cluster was caused by the first-generation, who contacted with more than ten Wuhan people during the annual meeting from January 15 to 16. Two cases in this cluster were tested positive again during isolation and observation after discharge. CONCLUSIONS: We determined incubation period was infectious, and confirmed that it was contagious 9 days before the onset.

We show that beyond the first 30 days of illness, people with COVID-19 exhibit a higher risk of death and use of health resources. Our high-dimensional approach identifies incident sequelae in the respiratory system, as well as several other sequelae that include nervous system and neurocognitive disorders, mental health disorders, metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, malaise, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain and anaemia. We show increased incident use of several therapeutic agents-including pain medications (opioids and non-opioids) as well as antidepressant, anxiolytic, antihypertensive and oral hypoglycaemic agents-as well as evidence of laboratory abnormalities in several organ systems. Our analysis of an array of prespecified outcomes reveals a risk gradient that increases according to the severity of the acute COVID-19 infection (that is, whether patients were not hospitalized, hospitalized or admitted to intensive care).

In this study, in vitro assays revealed antagonistic activity among these organisms, with B. gladioli demonstrating strong inhibition of B. glumae and B. plantarii. Strains of B. glumae and B. plantarii that express green fluorescent protein were constructed and used for cocultivation assays with B. gladioli, which confirmed the strong inhibitory activity of B. gladioli. Cell-free supernatants from each species were tested against cultures of counterpart species to evaluate the potential to inhibit bacterial growth. To investigate the inhibitory activity of B. gladioli on B. glumae and B. plantarii in rice, rice plant assays were performed and quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays were developed for in planta bacterial quantification. The results indicated that coinoculation with B. gladioli leads to significantly reduced disease severity and colonization of rice tissues compared with single inoculation with B. glumae or B. plantarii. This study demonstrates the interactions among three rice-pathogenic Burkholderia species and strong antagonistic activity of B. gladioli in vitro and in planta.

CDMS allows simultaneous measurement of the mass-to-charge ratio and charge of individual ions, so that mass distributions can be determined for highly heterogeneous proteins such as the heavily glycosylated S protein trimer. The CDMS results are compared to recent glycoproteomics studies of the structure and abundance of glycans at specific sites. Interestingly, average glycan masses determined by ""top-down"" CDMS measurements are 35-47% larger than those obtained from the ""bottom-up"" glycoproteomics studies, suggesting that the glycoproteomic measurements underestimated the abundances of larger, more-complex glycans. Moreover, the distribution of glycan masses determined by CDMS is much broader than the distribution expected from the glycoproteomics studies, assuming that glycan processing on each trimer is not correlated. The breadth of the glycan mass distribution therefore indicates heterogeneity in the extent of glycan processing of the S protein trimers, with some trimers being much more heavily processed than others. This heterogeneity may have evolved as a way of further confounding the host's immune system.","Miller, Lohra M; Barnes, Lauren F; Raab, Shannon A; Draper, Benjamin E; El-Baba, Tarick J; Lutomski, Corinne A; Robinson, Carol V; Clemmer, David E; Jarrold, Martin F",J Am Chem Soc,411,26

In this study, we asked whether they can also reduce HCV replication in vivo. We found that a single oral administration of CRV431 and NV556 to HCV-infected humanized-liver mice drastically reduced HCV blood levels. The antiviral effect was observed when CRV431 or NV556 were each individually administered with HCV, 3, 6 weeks or even 3 months post-infection when viral replication is robust. These results were confirmed in chimeric mice implanted with human hepatocytes isolated from three distinct donors. Remarkably, no viral rebound was observed 5 months after a single dose administration of 50 mg/kg of CRV431 or NV556 four weeks post-HCV infection, indicating the possibility of suppression of an established viral infection. Since we recently demonstrated that both CRV431 and NV556 also inhibit the development of liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in nonviral-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis mouse models, our present data suggest that the two entirely structurally different CypIs-CRV431 and NV556-derived from unrelated natural products, represent attractive partners to current direct-acting agent (DAA) regimens for the treatment of hepatitis C and liver diseases.","Bobardt, Michael; Hansson, Magnus Joakim; Mayo, Patrick; Ure, Daren; Foster, Robert; Gallay, Philippe",PLoS One,411,17

OBJECTIVES: To describe variation in intensive care unit (ICU) admission rates over time and by geography during the first wave of the epidemic in England, Wales and Northern Ireland; to describe trends in patient characteristics on admission to ICU, first 24-hour physiology in ICU, processes of care in ICU and patient outcomes; and to explore deviations in trends during the peak period. METHODS: Cohort of 10,741 patients with COVID-19 in the Case Mix Programme national clinical audit from 1 February to 31 July, 2020. Analyses were stratified by time period (pre-peak, peak, post-peak) and geographical region. Logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted differences in 28-day in-hospital mortality between periods. MAIN RESULTS: Admissions to ICU peaked almost simultaneously across regions but varied 4.6-fold in magnitude. Compared with patients admitted in the pre-peak period, patients admitted post-peak were slightly younger but with higher levels of dependency and comorbidity on admission to ICU and more deranged first 24-hour physiology. Despite this, receipt of invasive ventilation and renal replacement therapy reduced, and adjusted 28-day in-hospital mortality reduced by 11.8% (95% CI: 8.7%, 15.0%). Many variables exhibited u- or n-shaped curves during the peak. CONCLUSIONS: The population of patients with COVID-19 admitted to ICU, and the processes of care in ICU, changed over the first wave of the epidemic. After adjustment for important risk factors, there was substantial improvement in patient outcomes.

METHODS: In June-July 2020, we conducted an online survey of adults with dry eye who spent at least somewhat more time at home during the pandemic than before. Consistent with TFOS DEWS II guidelines, we categorized respondents into mild, moderate, or severe dry eye based on treatment usage. RESULTS: We included 388 respondents: 97 respondents (25%) with mild, 80 (21%) with moderate, and 211 (54%) with severe dry eye. In all three groups, screen/reading time generally doubled during the pandemic. Reduced work-related efficiency was noted by a considerable proportion of respondents (moderate dry eye: 51%, mild: 39%, and severe: 38%). Compared with respondents with mild dry eye, respondents with moderate dry eye were considerably more likely to note worsening symptoms: eye pain (OR = 2.57, 95% CI 1.22-5.41), headache from eye symptoms (OR = 2.34, 95% CI 1.11-4.90), and difficulty concentrating because of eye symptoms (OR = 2.79, 95% CI 1.37-5.66). Respondents with moderate dry eye with Sjögren's syndrome were most likely to note these. Respondents with severe dry eye were more likely than respondents with mild dry eye to report losing access to dry eye-related treatments (OR = 2.62, 95% CI 1.36-5.03). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic-related eye strain may be impacting symptoms, performance, and ultimately employment, especially for those with moderate dry eye. This may be compounding the already-high dry eye-related societal burden.","Saldanha, Ian J; Petris, Rebecca; Makara, Matthew; Channa, Prabjot; Akpek, Esen K",Ocul Surf,411,22

BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has caused immense disruption to healthcare services, and to reduce viral transmission, many services moved to off-site care delivery modalities such as telehealth. DESIGN: We used a qualitative descriptive design for this study. METHODS: Secondary analysis of semistructured interviews with alcohol and other drug nurses from Australia and New Zealand (n = 19) was conducted in July and August 2020. Data were analysed using thematic analysis and reported using COREQ guidelines. RESULTS: Three were identified: '""All our face-to-face contact ceased with clients"": Changing service delivery', '""How do I do my job when I can't see you?"": An anxious shift in service delivery' and '""A lot of Indigenous people don't like the FaceTiming and all that"": Challenges to delivery of services through telehealth'. CONCLUSION: Participants in our study reported challenges in transitioning to telehealth modalities. The perceived loss of therapeutic communication, difficulties in assessing risks to healthcare consumers such as domestic violence and challenges delivering telehealth care to a marginalized consumer cohort need to be overcome before telehealth is considered successful in alcohol and other drug treatment. However, telehealth was a successful adjunct to existing practices for nurses working with consumers in regional or remote areas or where consumers preferred this method of service delivery. IMPACT: Nurses in this study described substantial issues with the delivery of alcohol and other drug treatment via telehealth, including a perception that telehealth was a barrier to addressing risks to consumers who use alcohol and other drugs, and difficulties working in a therapeutically beneficial way via telehealth. Telehealth is a means to reduce viral transmission through a reduction in face-to-face contact, and although it may be useful for some service functions, it may be detrimental to the clinical services nurses provide.","Searby, Adam; Burr, Dianna",J. adv. nurs,411,21

Chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2)-dependent monocyte trafficking plays an essential role in the establishment of CD8 TRMs in lungs of IAV-infected mice. Here, we used a combination adjuvant-based subunit vaccine strategy that evokes multifaceted (TC1/TC17/TH1/TH17) IAV nucleoprotein-specific lung TRMs, to determine whether CCR2 and monocyte infiltration are essential for vaccine-induced TRM development and protective immunity to IAV in lungs. Following intranasal vaccination, neutrophils, monocytes, conventional DCs and monocyte-derived dendritic cells internalized and processed vaccine antigen in lungs. We found that Basic Leucine Zipper ATF-Like Transcription Factor 3 (BATF-3)-dependent DCs were essential for eliciting T cell responses, but CCR2 deficiency enhanced the differentiation of CD127HI/KLRG-1LO, OX40+veCD62L+ve and mucosally imprinted CD69+veCD103+ve effector and memory CD8 T cells in lungs and airways of vaccinated mice. Mechanistically, increased development of lung TRMs, induced by CCR2 deficiency was linked to dampened expression of T-bet, but not altered TCF-1 levels or T cell receptor signaling in CD8 T cells. T1/T17 functional programming, parenchymal localization of CD8/CD4 effector and memory T cells, recall T cell responses and protective immunity to a lethal IAV infection were unaffected in CCR2-deficient mice. Taken together, we identified a negative regulatory role for CCR2 and monocyte trafficking in mucosal imprinting and differentiation of vaccine-induced TRMs. Mechanistic insights from this study may aid the development of T-cell-based vaccines against respiratory viral pathogens including IAV and SARS-CoV-2.ImportanceWhile antibody-based immunity to influenza A virus (IAV) is type and sub-type specific, lung and airway-resident memory T cells that recognize conserved epitopes in the internal viral proteins are known to provide heterosubtypic immunity. Hence, broadly protective IAV vaccines need to elicit robust T-cell memory in the respiratory tract. We have developed a combination adjuvant-based IAV nucleoprotein vaccine that elicits strong CD4 and CD8 T cell memory in lungs and protects against H1N1 and H5N1 strains of IAV. In this study, we examined the mechanisms that control vaccine-induced protective memory T cells in the respiratory tract. We found that trafficking of monocytes into lungs might limit the development of anti-viral lung-resident memory T cells, following intranasal vaccination. These findings suggested that strategies that limit monocyte infiltration can potentiate vaccine-induced frontline T-cell immunity to respiratory viruses, such as IAV and SARS-CoV-2.","Lee, Woojong; Kingstad-Bakke, Brock; Kedl, Ross M; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro; Suresh, M",J. virol,411,1

Symptoms of depression, unspecific anxiety and COVID-19 related anxiety were ascertained with standardized questionnaires. Frequency, duration and diversity of media exposure were positively associated with more symptoms of depression and unspecific and COVID-19 specific anxiety. We obtained the critical threshold of seven times per day and 2.5 h of media exposure to mark the difference between mild and moderate symptoms of (un)specific anxiety and depression. Particularly the usage of social media was associated with more pronounced psychological strain. Participants with pre-existing fears seem to be particularly vulnerable for mental distress related to more immoderate media consumption. Our findings provide some evidence for problematical associations of COVID-19 related media exposure with psychological strain and could serve as an orientation for recommendations-especially with regard to the thresholds of critical media usage.","Bendau, Antonia; Petzold, Moritz Bruno; Pyrkosch, Lena; Mascarell Maricic, Lea; Betzler, Felix; Rogoll, Janina; Große, Julia; Ströhle, Andreas; Plag, Jens",Eur. arch. psychiatr. clin. neurosci,411,26

Methods: Literatures and clinical reports were reviewed to analyze the relationship between Huopu Xialing Decoction and damp pathogen stagnation of lung syndrome of early stage of COVID-19. TCMSP database was used to screen the potential active components in Huopo Xialing Decoction. Molecular docking of the active components with SARS-CoV-2 hydrolase and ACE2 was also carried out. According to the binding ability, the core components with both were screened. The interaction network of key components target proteins was constructed by using the software of Cytoscape to screen the main targets; The GO analysis of the main targets was carried out by using the STRING database, and the Pathway and KEGG enrichment analysis was carried out by using the plug-in of the software ClueGO of Cytoscape. Results: The Huopo Xialing Decoction was used to treat the early coronavirus pneumonia with damp pathogen and lung depression syndrome in the relationship analysis between prescriptions and syndrome, and the potential components of the 12 ingredients in Huopo Xialing Decoction were selected, with 67 core targets. Among them, paryriogenin I from Tetrapanax papyrifer, ergosterol peroxide from Poria cocos and Polyporus umbellatus, baicalin from Pinellia ternata had good binding activity with SARS-CoV-2 3CL hydrolase and ACE2.

This study was undertaken to analyse the effect of meteorological parameters such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed on the spread of ongoing COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia. Methods: The COVID-19 dashboard for five major cities of Saudi Arabia - Riyadh, Makah, Jeddah, Medina and Dammam was used for data collection. The data on weather were collected from the Weather Underground Company (IBM business GA, USA, 2020). The data were analysed by Spearman's rank correlations using JASP statistical software in two main sections. In the first section the data on COVID-19 from cities were combined to analyse the overall picture of COVID-19 and in the second section, different meteorological parameters such as temperature, humidity and wind speed were analyzed. Results: Novel data revealed interesting facts on the spreading of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia, the data showed that the number of COVID-19 positive cases increases due to the decrease of temperature or humidity, whereas an average decrease in the wind speed was also found to be associated with an elevation of the number of positive cases. Conclusions: This study determined the impact meteorological factors on the infectivity rate of COVID-19. An inverse association was found between the meteorological parameters with the spreading of COIVD-19. Therefore, this study directs the health authorities to implement specific measures against the spreading of this global pandemic based on weather patterns.","Alkhowailed, Mohammad; Shariq, Ali; Alqossayir, Fuhaid; Alzahrani, Osama A; Rasheed, Zafar; Al Abdulmonem, Waleed",Inform Med Unlocked,411,26

We have also witnessed millions of people with increased mental health issues, such as depression, stress, worry, fear, disgust, sadness, and anxiety, which have become one of the major public health concerns during this severe health crisis. For instance, depression is one of the most common mental health issues according to the findings made by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Depression can cause serious emotional, behavioural and physical health problems with significant consequences, both personal and social costs included. This paper studies community depression dynamics due to COVID-19 pandemic through user-generated content on Twitter. A new approach based on multi-modal features from tweets and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is proposed to build depression classification models. Multi-modal features capture depression cues from emotion, topic and domain-specific perspectives. We study the problem using recently scraped tweets from Twitter users emanating from the state of New South Wales in Australia. Our novel classification model is capable of extracting depression polarities which may be affected by COVID-19 and related events during the COVID-19 period. The results found that people became more depressed after the outbreak of COVID-19. The measures implemented by the government such as the state lockdown also increased depression levels. Further analysis in the Local Government Area (LGA) level found that the community depression level was different across different LGAs. Such granular level analysis of depression dynamics not only can help authorities such as governmental departments to take corresponding actions more objectively in specific regions if necessary but also allows users to perceive the dynamics of depression over the time.","Zhou, Jianlong; Zogan, Hamad; Yang, Shuiqiao; Jameel, Shoaib; Xu, Guandong; Chen, Fang",,411,24

The brief paper employs a thought experiment to identify factors which affect individuals’ propensity to cooperate in the public goods game. These factors reasonably comprise, for example, risk perception and attitude towards risk, embeddedness in a social network or the desire for social approval and may differ remarkably among the individuals of a collective. The paper adopts a management control perspective which appears to be particularly helpful to identify how to implement policy makers’ actions with respect to the diverse individuals in a collective. In order to predict the overall outcome of “unpleasant” actions, an approach is required which allows to capture the heterogeneity of individuals within a collective which makes agent-based modelling a promising candidate.","Wall, Friederike",Mind Soc.,411,4

This systematic review of the literature aims to identify the evidence basis for using telemedicine in otolaryngology practice to limit person-to-person interactions while achieving comparable quality to in-person services. METHODS: The authors gathered articles from three databases (Embase, PubMed and Web of Science), performed a comprehensive literature review of articles published on telemedicine since 2002, and selected articles for inclusion based on their relevance to otolaryngology and the potential of the intervention to improve patient social distancing. RESULTS: A total of 7153 articles were identified from the initial query. After review, 35 met the inclusion criteria. Of the included articles, 32 (91%), found their specific telemedicine intervention to be effective when compared to in-person services. Twenty articles (57%) were related to remote otoscopy. Other telemedical interventions included videoconferencing for peri-operative visits, diagnosis of peritonsillar abscess, telephone-based voice evaluations and evaluation of nasal fractures. CONCLUSIONS: Video-otoscopy is the most well-supported telemedical intervention which limits physical contact between otolaryngologists and their patients. Other interventions have also demonstrated efficacy but have yet to be as widely validated as video-otoscopy. Telehealth facilitators play a key role in providing high-quality telehealth services. More invasive procedures, such as laryngoscopy, require further evidence to demonstrate definite benefits in a telemedicine setting.","Moentmann, Michael R; Miller, Ryan J; Chung, Michael T; Yoo, George H",J Telemed Telecare,411,24

MethodsA total of 18,543 subjects received a single-dose of either of the vaccines at one vaccination centre in KSA, and were followed up for three to eight months. Clinical data from medical records, adverse events (AEs) from a self-reporting system, and COVID-19 infection data from the national databases were retrieved and analysed. ResultsSubjects median age was 33 years old with an average of 27.3 body mass index and the majority were male (60.1%). 92.17% of the subjects had no COVID-19 infection post-vaccination. Diabetes mellitus (p=0.0325), organ transplantation (p=0.0254), and morbid obesity (p=0.0014) were risk factors for infection post-vaccination. Unlike vaccine type, being Saudi, male, or obese was more likely to get the infection earlier. AE reports from 1084 subjects included injection site pain, fatigue, fever, myalgia, headache. ConclusionSingle-dose COVID-19 vaccines in KSA showed an effectiveness rate of 92.17% up to eight months follow-up. The rate for AZD1222 was higher than what have been previously reported.

Although it is widely recognized that the crystalline structure of a cathode material largely dictates its electrochemical properties (e.g. capacity, cycle life and rate capabilities), this intrinsic connection in LiFePO4 has not been systematically reviewed. Different from the previous reviews, which mainly focus on the improvement of electrochemical performance by all kinds of techniques, in this review, the relationship between its electrochemical performance and bulk/surface structure is reviewed and discussed. First, it is revealed that the intra-particle Li+ transfer is influenced by several properties of the bulk, including crystalline structures, antisite defects and electronic structures. Next, it is demonstrated that the surface/interfacial structures of LiFePO4, which can be reconstructed artificially or spontaneously, also have great impacts on the performances. Lastly, the intrinsic connection between the structure and performance is preliminarily established, showing brand-new perspectives on the strategy for further improvement and contributing to a comprehensive understanding of LiFePO4.","Hu, Jiangtao; Huang, Weiyuan; Yang, Luyi; Pan, Feng",Nanoscale (Online),411,26

Design: A network cohort study. Setting: Six databases from the United States containing routinely-collected patient data: HealthVerity, Premier, IQVIA Open Claims, Optum EHR, Optum SES, and VA-OMOP. Patients: Patients hospitalized with a clinical diagnosis or a positive test result for COVID-19. Interventions: Dialysis, tracheostomy, and ECMO. Measurements and Main Results: 240,392 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were included (22,887 from HealthVerity, 139,971 from IQVIA Open Claims, 29,061 from Optum EHR, 4,336 from OPTUM SES, 36,019 from Premier, and 8,118 from VA-OMOP). Across the six databases, 9,703 (4.04% [95% CI: 3.96% to 4.11%]) patients received dialysis, 1,681 (0.70% [0.67% to 0.73%]) had a tracheostomy, and 398 (0.17% [95% CI: 0.15% to 0.18%]) patients underwent ECMO over the 30 days following hospitalization. Use of ECMO was generally concentrated among patients who were younger, male, and with fewer comorbidities except for obesity. Tracheostomy was used for a similar proportion of patients regardless of age, sex, or comorbidity. While dialysis was used for a similar proportion among younger and older patients, it was more frequent among male patients and among those with chronic kidney disease. Conclusion: Use of dialysis among those hospitalized with COVID-19 is high at around 4%. Although less than one percent of patients undergo tracheostomy and ECMO, the absolute numbers of patients who have undergone these interventions is substantial and can be expected to continue grow given the continuing spread of the COVID-19.","Burn, Edward; Sena, Anthony G; Prats-Uribe, Albert; Spotnitz, Matthew; DuVall, Scott; Lynch, Kristine E; Matheny, Michael E; Nyberg, Fredrik; Ahmed, Waheed-Ul-Rahman; Alser, Osaid; Alghoul, Heba; Alshammari, Thamir; Zhang, Lin; Casajust, Paula; Areia, Carlos; Shah, Karishma; Reich, Christian; Blacketer, Clair; Andryc, Alan; Fortin, Stephen; Natarajan, Karthik; Gong, Mengchun; Golozar, Asieh; Morales, Daniel; Rijnbeek, Peter; Subbian, Vignesh; Roel, Elena; Recalde, Martina; Lane, Jennifer C E; Vizcaya, David; Posada, Jose D; Shah, Nigam H; Jonnagaddala, Jitendra; Hui Lai, Lana Yin; Avilés-Jurado, Francesc Xavier; Hripcsak, George; Suchard, Marc A; Ranzani, Otavio T; Ryan, Patrick; Prieto-Alhambra, Daniel; Kostka, Kristin; Duarte-Salles, Talita",,411,24

Especially during the months of confinement, an alarming increase in the incidence of several risk factors for cerebrovascular diseases was noticed, without, however, the proportional strengthening of strategies for the prevention and/or control of comorbidities. Patients who had already suffered a stroke were neglected from the secondary prevention routine and neurological rehabilitation therapies. Regarding the acute treatment, the fear of contagion in the hospital environment promoted a significant delay in the time from the onset of symptoms to admission to an emergency department as well as in the door to imaging and door to needle times. Moreover, the pandemic also exposed the enormous inequalities in the approach to cerebrovascular diseases worldwide. Actually, many consequences of COVID-19 in stroke care will persist for months even after pandemic control.

We compared the figures for 2020 with those corresponding to the same period in 2016–2019, including their temporal and spatial distributions. Our findings show that the number of rescues undertaken by the Catalan Fire Department in July and August 2020 increased significantly compared to the same summer period in the four previous years (+39.7%). The daily averages increased for both weekends and weekdays in 2020, with 7.5 and 3.9 rescues per day, respectively. The greatest increase corresponded to rescue operations conducted at low altitudes (up to 500 m ASL) and areas with no specific protection status near to populated places. Natural areas were perceived safer than, for example, coastal destinations in terms of the risk of COVID-19 contagion, and they experienced a growth in visitors during the first summer of the pandemic. One consequence of this was an increase in emergency service activity to rescue people in natural areas. This research adds new evidence of the multiple indirect effects of the reconfiguration of mobilities in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings could be of interest to emergency service managers, managers of protected natural areas, and public authorities.","Saladié, Òscar Bustamante Edgar Gutiérrez Aaron",Land,411,24

A large-scale longitudinal study is urgently required. METHODS: We analyzed 606 CT scans of 182 patients. The dynamic evolution of CT scores was evaluated using two staging methods: one was divided into 10 periods based on decile intervals, and the other was one stage per week. Moreover, the latter was used to evaluate the dynamic evolution of imaging performance. A published severity scoring system was used to compare findings of the two methods. RESULTS: In the dynamic evolution of 10 stages, the total lesion CT score peaked during stage 3 (9-11 days) and stage 6 (17-18 days), with scores = 7.19 ± 3.66 and 8.00 ± 4.57, respectively. The consolidation score peaked during stage 6 (17-18 days; score = 2.72 ± 3.07). In contrast, when a 1-week interval was used and time was divided into five stages, the total lesion score peaked during week 3 (score = 7.3 ± 4.15). The consolidation score peaked during week 2 (score = 2.54 ± 3.25). The predominant CT patterns differed significantly during each stage (P < 0.01). Ground-glass opacities (GGO), with an increased trend during week 3 and beyond, was the most common pattern in each stage (33-46%). The second most common patterns during week 1 were GGO and consolidation (24%). The linear opacity pattern with an increased trend was the second most common pattern during week 2 and beyond (21-32%). CONCLUSIONS: The total lesion score of mild COVID-19 pneumonia peaked 17-18 days after disease onset. The consolidation scores objectively reflected the severity of the lung involvement compared with total lesion scores. Each temporal stage of mild COVID-19 pneumonia mainly manifested as GGO pattern. Moreover, good prognosis may be associated with increases in the proportions of the GGO and linear opacity patterns during the later stage of disease.","Liu, Huaping; Luo, Shiyong; Zhang, Youming; Jiang, Yuzhu; Jiang, Yuting; Wang, Yayi; Li, Hailan; Huang, Chiyao; Zhang, Shunzhen; Li, Xili; Tan, Yiqing; Wang, Wei",Infect Dis Ther,411,16

The findings of the study suggest that, financially, hotels performed better than restaurants, which themselves performed better than casinos. These findings are consistent with medical recommendations concerning the relative safety of various hospitality-related activities and, therefore, also with the tenets of financial market efficiency in the hospitality sector. Additional findings suggest that hospitality firms with strong balance sheets and income statements characterized by relatively low leverage ratios, high market value (consistent with a “too big to fail” mentality), and higher price/earnings ratios (implying higher relative profitability) all fared better than smaller, weaker firms. Although, in no case, did Bloomberg's proprietary environmental, social, and governance (ESG) variable possess any predictive power, variables reflecting cross-country cultural differences support Huynh’s (2020) finding that “individualism” was an important factor in explaining the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospitality firms.","Clark, John Mauck Nathan Pruitt Stephen W.",Research in International Business and Finance,411,16

IL-6 also plays a complex role in hemostasis and thrombosis. We observed a transient elevation of D-dimer in our patients who received tocilizumab, which triggered this study. Methods A retrospective hospital-based cohort analysis of patients with confirmed COVID-19 who received tocilizumab during the study period of March 15, 2020, to May 20, 2020, was conducted. We retrieved demographic, clinical, and laboratory data, and patients who were receiving therapeutic anticoagulation therapy prior to tocilizumab administration were excluded. Descriptive analysis was performed, and the cause of death and trends of D-dimer and inflammatory markers were studied. Results Out of the 436 confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted during the study period, 24 met the inclusion criteria. Their median age was 47.5 years. They were 18 males and 6 females;15 patients survived and nine expired. Of the group that survived, 12 received therapeutic anticoagulation. Of the seven patients who did not receive therapeutic anticoagulation, four expired (one from sepsis and three probably from thromboembolic complications) compared to five deaths in the 17 patients who received therapeutic anticoagulation (four from sepsis and one possibly from thromboembolic complications). Conclusions The interplay between IL-6, IL-6 receptor antagonist, and venous thromboembolism is complex. We observed a transient elevation of D-timer in COVID-19 patients who received tocilizumab, and a trend toward increased death secondary to thromboembolism. This observation is novel and highlights the potential thrombophilic side effects of tocilizumab.","Chan, K. H.; Patel, B.; Podel, B.; Szablea, M. E.; Shaaban, H.

The main source of financing is social contributions, proportional to income. The provision of care is based on the principles of independent medical practice, free choice of physician and care facility, and predominantly fee-for-service payment. The Belgian population enjoys good health and long life expectancy. This is partly due to the population's good access to many high-quality health services. However, some challenges remain in terms of appropriateness of pharmaceutical care (overuse of antibiotics and psychotropic drugs), reduced accessibility for mental health and dental care due to higher user charges, socioeconomic inequalities in health status and the need for further strengthening of prevention policies. The system must also continue to evolve to cope with an ageing population, an increase of chronic diseases and the development of new technologies. This Belgian HiT profile (2020) presents the evolution of the health system since 2014, including detailed information on new policies. The most important reforms concern the transfer of additional health competences from the Federal State to the Federated entities and the plan to redesign the landscape of hospital care. Policy-makers have also pursued the goals of further improving access to high-quality services, while maintaining the financial sustainability and efficiency of the system, resulting in the implementation of several measures promoting multidisciplinary and integrated care, the concentration of medical expertise, patient care trajectories, patient empowerment, evidence-based medicine, outcome-based care and the so-called one health approach. Cooperation with neighbouring countries on pricing and reimbursement policies to improve access to (very high price) innovative medicines are also underway.

We aimed to describe trajectories of depression, anxiety and stress symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak compared to before the outbreak, and to determine if trajectories were modified by pre-pandemic loneliness, poor sleep quality and mental health problems. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study with 1836 Swedish university students entering the study before 13 March 2020, the onset of the pandemic, with follow-ups within three (FU1) and six months (FU2) of the outbreak. Generalized Estimating Equations were used to estimate mean differences in symptom levels over time-periods, and to estimate potential effect modifications. RESULTS: We found small differences in mean levels of the depression, anxiety and stress scale (DASS-21) over time. Compared to before the pandemic, depression increased by 0.25 points of 21 (95% CI: 0.04 to -0.45) at FU1 and decreased by 0.75/21 (95% CI:-0.97 to -0.53) at FU2.

Italy was one of the first countries with the highest number of deaths in the world due to SARS-CoV-2. Here we propose a management model for the reorganization of liver transplant (LT) activities and policies in a local intensive care unit (ICU) assigned to liver transplantation affected by restrictions on mobility and availability of donors and recipients as well as health personnel and beds. We describe the solutions implemented to continue transplantation activities throughout a given pandemic: management of donors and recipients' LT program, ICU rearrangement, healthcare personnel training and monitoring to minimize mortality rates of patients on the waiting list. Transplantation activities from February 22, 2020, the data of first known COVID-19 case in Italy's Emilia Romagna region to June 30, 2020, were compared with the corresponding period in 2019. During the 2020 study period, 38 LTs were performed, whereas 41 were performed in 2019. Patients transplanted during the COVID-19 pandemic had higher MELD and MELD-Na scores, cold ischaemia times, and hospitalization rates (p < 0.05); accordingly, they spent fewer days on the waitlist and had a lower prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma (p < 0.05). No differences were found in the provenance area, additional MELD scores, age of donors and recipients, BMI, re-transplant rates, and post-transplant mortality. No transplanted patients contracted COVID-19, although five healthcare workers did. Ultimately, our policy allowed us to continue the ICU's operations by prioritizing patients hospitalized with higher MELD without any case of transplant infection due to COVID-19.","Siniscalchi, Antonio; Vitale, Giovanni; Morelli, Maria Cristina; Ravaioli, Matteo; Laici, Cristiana; Bianchini, Amedeo; Del Gaudio, Massimo; Conti, Fabio; Vizioli, Luca; Cescon, Matteo",Intern Emerg Med,411,16

In previous winters, we had been treating patients with seasonal influenza. While creating a larger impact on the health care systems, comparisons regarding the intensive care unit (ICU) courses of both diseases are lacking. We compared patients with influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infections treated at a tertiary care facility offering treatment for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and being a high-volume facility for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Patients with COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic (n = 64) were compared to 64 patients with severe influenza from 2016 to 2020 at our ICU. All patients were treated using a standardized protocol. ECMO was used in cases of severe ARDS. Both groups had similar comorbidities. Time in ICU and mortality were not significantly different, yet mortality with ECMO was high amongst COVID-19 patients with approximately two-thirds not surviving. This is in contrast to a mortality of less than 40% in influenza patients with ECMO. Mortality was higher than estimated by SAPSII score on admission in both groups. Patients with COVID-19 were more likely to be male and non-smokers than those with influenza. The outcomes for patients with severe disease were similar. The study helps to understand similarities and differences between patients treated for severe influenza infections and COVID-19.","Herbstreit, Frank Overbeck Marvin Berger Marc Moritz Skarabis Annabell Brenner Thorsten Schmidt Karsten",Journal of Clinical Medicine,411,16

However, the association of individuals' beliefs in conspiracy theories about COVID-19 with mental health and well-being issues has not been investigated. This association creates an assessable channel to identify and provide assistance to people with mental health and well-being issues during the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to provide the first evidence that belief in conspiracy theories regarding the COVID-19 pandemic is a predictor of the mental health and well-being of health care workers. METHODS: We conducted a survey of 252 health care workers in Ecuador from April 10 to May 2, 2020. We analyzed the data regarding distress and anxiety caseness with logistic regression and the data regarding life and job satisfaction with linear regression. RESULTS: Among the 252 sampled health care workers in Ecuador, 61 (24.2%) believed that the virus was developed intentionally in a lab; 82 (32.5%) experienced psychological distress, and 71 (28.2%) had anxiety disorder. Compared to health care workers who were not sure where the virus originated, those who believed the virus was developed intentionally in a lab were more likely to report psychological distress and anxiety disorder and to have lower levels of job satisfaction and life satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: This paper identifies belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories as an important predictor of distress, anxiety, and job and life satisfaction among health care workers. This finding will enable mental health services to better target and provide help to mentally vulnerable health care workers during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Chen, Xi; Zhang, Stephen X; Jahanshahi, Asghar Afshar; Alvarez-Risco, Aldo; Dai, Huiyang; Li, Jizhen; Ibarra, Verónica García",JMIR Public Health Surveill,411,26

The greatest diversity of proterodiplostomids is found in crocodilians, although some parasitise snakes and turtles. According to the most recent revision, the Proterodiplostomidae included 17 genera within 5 subfamilies. Despite the complex taxonomic structure of the family, availability of testable morphology-based phylogenetic hypotheses and ancient hosts, molecular phylogenetic analyses of the group were practically lacking. Herein, we use novel DNA sequence data of the nuclear lsrRNA gene and mitochondrial cox1 gene from a broad range of proterodiplostomid taxa obtained from crocodilian, fish, and snake hosts on four continents to test the monophyly of the family and evaluate the present morphology-based classification system of the Proterodiplostomidae in comparison with the molecular phylogeny. This first detailed phylogeny for the Proterodiplostomidae challenges the current systematic framework. Combination of molecular phylogenetic data with examination of freshly collected quality specimens and re-evaluation of morphological criteria resulted in a number of systematic and nomenclatural changes along with a new phylogeny-based classification of the Proterodiplostomidae. As the result of our molecular and morphological analyses: (i) the current subfamily structure of the Proterodiplostomidae is abolished; (ii) three new genera, Paraproterodiplostomum n. g., Neocrocodilicola n. g. and Proteroduboisia n. g., are described and Pseudoneodiplostomoides Yamaguti, 1954 is restored and elevated from subgenus to genus level; (iii) two new species, Paraproterodiplostomum currani n. g., n. sp. and Archaeodiplostomum overstreeti n. sp., are described from the American alligator in Mississippi, USA. Comparison of the structure of terminal ducts of the reproductive system in all proterodiplostomid genera did not support the use of these structures for differentiation among subfamilies (or major clades) within the family, although they proved to be useful for distinguishing among genera and species. Our study includes the first report of proterodiplostomids from Australia and the first evidence of a snake acting as a paratenic host for a proterodiplostomid. A key to proterodiplostomid genera is provided. Questions of proterodiplostomid-host associations parasitic in crocodilians are discussed in connection with their historical biogeography. Our molecular phylogeny of the Proterodiplostomidae closely matches the current molecular phylogeny of crocodilians. Directions for future studies of the Proterodiplostomidae are outlined.","Tkach, Vasyl V; Achatz, Tyler J; Pulis, Eric E; Junker, Kerstin; Snyder, Scott D; Bell, Jeffrey A; Halajian, Ali; de Vasconcelos Melo, Francisco Tiago",Syst Parasitol,411,20

Despite this, there is a lack of research on how to care for patients dying of COVID-19, specifically pharmacological management of symptoms. AIM: The aim was to determine the dose ranges of pharmacological interventions commonly used to manage symptoms in adult patients dying of COVID-19, establish how effectiveness of these interventions was measured, and whether the pharmacological interventions were effective. DESIGN: This was a rapid systematic review with narrative synthesis of evidence, prospectively registered on PROSPERO (ID: CRD42020210892). DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL via the NICE Evidence Health Databases Advanced Search interface; medRxiv; the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register; and Google Scholar with no date limits. We included primary studies which documented care of patients dying of COVID-19 under the care of a specialist palliative care team. RESULTS: Seven studies, documenting the care of 493 patients met the inclusion criteria. Approximately two thirds of patients required a continuous subcutaneous infusion with median doses of 15 mg morphine and 10 mg midazolam in the last 24 h of life. Four studies described effectiveness by retrospective review of documentation. One study detailed the effectiveness of individual medications. CONCLUSIONS: A higher proportion of patients required continuous subcutaneous infusion than is typically encountered in palliative care. Doses of medications required to manage symptoms were generally modest. There was no evidence of a standardised yet holistic approach to measure effectiveness of these medications and this needs to be urgently addressed.","Heath, Laura; Carey, Matthew; Lowney, Aoife C; Harriss, Eli; Miller, Mary",Palliat Med,411,32

In this study, the urological interventions applied with appropriate infrastructure and protocols during the pandemic in the pandemic hospital that is carrying out the COVID-19 struggle are analyzed. METHODS: Urological interventions were reviewed in the 5-week period between March 11 and April 16. The distribution of outpatient and interventional procedures was determined by weeks concurrently along with the COVID-19 patient workload, and data in the country, subgroups were further analyzed. Patients intervened were divided into four groups as Emergency, High, Intermediate, and Low Priority cases according to the EAU recommendations. The COVID-19-related findings were recorded; staff and patient effects were reported. RESULTS: Of the 160 interventions, 65 were minimally invasive or open surgical intervention, 95 were non-surgical outpatient intervention, and the outpatient admission was 777. According to the priority level, 33 cases had emergency and high priority, 32 intermediate and low priority.

The purpose of this study is to uncover the features of enterprises’ resilience during and after an external shock such as the GFC might be helpful in predicting the shock impact on enterprises and setting proper policy measures for the upcoming COVID-19 crisis. Design/methodology/approach: The authors analysed the impact of the GFC on the entrepreneurial population in/of the Czech Republic using marginal effects method on a large random sample of 4,478 enterprises. In this analysis, the authors defined two groups of enterprises – “winners” and “losers” – based on the company’s dissolution and performance indicators. Findings: The GFC struck the enterprise population asymmetrically in terms of the enterprises’ characteristics but also in terms of time. Micro and small size companies are the most vulnerable to external shocks such as the GFC. Technological level plays an important role in the recovery phase, especially in the case of manufacturing micro enterprises. Research limitations/implications: Although there are differences between the GFC and the COVID-19 crisis, the GFC was the only comparable shock in modern history in its global nature, depth and unpredicted occurrence. It can be expected that the impact on enterprises can be partly similar. Practical implications: Government support of micro size companies should be the priority in the upcoming COVID-19 crisis. Supporting the innovation and technology progress might accelerate the recovery phase after the crisis especially in micro companies as well. Originality/value: This paper presents interesting insights into the impact of external shocks such as the GFC or COVID-19 on enterprises.

Specifically, we focused on the relationships between ICT use and perceived importance of social connectedness and future anxiety, while considering relevant personality and psychosocial factors. A U.S. sample of 394 adults answered questions about ICT use, pandemic-related reactions and actions, demographics, and psychosocial factors via an online survey. Using logistic regression, findings indicated that personality (extraversion and conscientiousness) and psychosocial (need to belong and perceived attachment to phone) factors, types of ICT as news source, and gender were associated with perceived importance of social connectedness. Neuroticism, time spent on ICT for social purposes, and perceived threat of COVID-19 were associated with future anxiety. In addition, using Mann-Whitney U test, people who rated higher on importance of social connectedness had higher ICT use, both in terms of types and time spent on ICT. Overall, results are consistent with the idea that technology is a coping tool during the pandemic and balanced use can lead to feelings of social connectedness and less future anxiety. Therefore, it is important for authorities to align their messaging and outreach with people's psychosocial, personality, and health considerations through ICT channels while empowering ICT users to be responsible for their interactions with the technology.","Lee, Yi-Ching; Malcein, Lindsey A; Kim, Sojung Claire",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),411,1

Two divergent hypotheses have been proposed: hyperinflammatory cytokine storm; and failure of host protective immunity that results in unrestrained viral dissemination and organ injury. A key explanation for the inability to address this controversy has been the lack of diagnostic tools to evaluate immune function in COVID-19 infections. ELISpot, a highly sensitive, functional immunoassay, was employed in 27 patients with COVID-19, 51 patients with sepsis, 18 critically ill nonseptic (CINS) patients, and 27 healthy control volunteers to evaluate adaptive and innate immune status by quantitating T cell IFN-É£ and monocyte TFN-&#945; production. Circulating T cell subsets were profoundly reduced in COVID-19 patients. Additionally, stimulated blood mononuclear cells produced less than 40%-50% of the IFN-É£ and TNF-&#945; observed in septic and CINS patients, consistent with markedly impaired immune effector cell function. Approximately 25% of COVID-19 patients had increased IL-6 levels that were not associated with elevations in other canonical proinflammatory cytokines. Collectively, these findings support the hypothesis that COVID-19 suppresses host functional adaptive and innate immunity. Importantly, IL-7 administered ex vivo restored T cell IFN-É£ production in COVID-19 patients. Thus, ELISpot may functionally characterize host immunity in COVID-19 and inform prospective therapies.","Remy, Kenneth E; Mazer, Monty; Striker, David A; Ellebedy, Ali H; Walton, Andrew H; Unsinger, Jacqueline; Blood, Teresa M; Mudd, Philip A; Yi, Daehan J; Mannion, Daniel A; Osborne, Dale F; Martin, R Scott; Anand, Nitin J; Bosanquet, James P; Blood, Jane; Drewry, Anne M; Caldwell, Charles C; Turnbull, Isaiah R; Brakenridge, Scott C; Moldwawer, Lyle L; Hotchkiss, Richard S",JCI insight,411,16

We estimate the coefficient of exposing rate, the coefficient of infection rate, the coefficient of recovery rate and the coefficient of mortality rate of the new coronavirus disease in addition to the basic reproductive ratio values of the disease in the Middle East countries, namely Bahrain, Cyprus, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the Syrian Arab Republic, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey and Yemen where we apply the SEIR epidemic model.Short conclusionWe find that the values of the basic reproductive ratio of the new coronavirus disease based on the used model in the Middle East countries start from 1.5583 to 3.0395 in the first stage and from 1.0001 to 4.5757. Besides, we find that the problem of the new coronavirus disease in Lebanon and in the Syrian Arab Republic is not good at all in the recent stage based on the values of the basic reproductive ratio comparing with other Middle East countries. Also, we find that the value of the basic reproductive ratio for the second stage is near one;however, if we apply the method for the following stages, we find that the values return to be larger because lots of people in that stage and after did not follow the governmental procedures for stopping the spreading of the disease.","Al-Raeei, Marwan",Bulletin of the National Research Centre,411,26

The adage ""old drug, new trick"" in this context may suggest the important therapeutic potential of existing drugs. We found that the lopinavir/ritonavir treatment recommended in the fifth edition of the Treatment Plan of China can only help to improve a minority of throat-swab nucleic-acid results (3/15) in hospitals. Our previous use of chloroquine to treat patients with COVID-19 infection showed an improvement in more throat-swab nucleic-acid results (5/10) than the use of lopinavir/ritonavir. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a prospective, open-label, randomized controlled, multicenter clinical study. The study consists of three phases: a screening period, a treatment period of no more than 10 days, and a follow-up period for each participant. Participants with COVID-19 infection who are eligible for selection for the study will be randomly allocated to the trial group or the control group. The control group will be given lopinavir/ritonavir treatment for no more than 10 days. The trial group will be given chloroquine phosphate treatment for no more than 10 days. The primary outcome is the clinical recovery time at no more than 28 days after the completion of therapy and follow-up. The secondary outcomes include the rate of treatment success after the completion of therapy and follow-up, the time of treatment success after no more than 28 days, the rate of serious adverse events during the completion of therapy and follow-up, and the time to return to normal temperature (calculated from the onset of illness) during the completion of therapy and follow-up. Comparisons will be performed using two-sided tests with a statistical significance level of 5%. DISCUSSION: This experiment should reveal the efficacy and safety of using chloroquine versus lopinavir/ritonavir for patients with mild/general COVID-19 infection. If the new treatment including chloroquine shows a higher rate of throat-swab SARS-CoV-2 real-time fluorescent reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) negativity and is safe, it could be tested as a future COVID-19 treatment.

At present, the disease has been posing a serious threat to the communities, and it is critical to know the communities' level of adherence on COVID-19 prevention measures. Thus, this study aimed to identify the predictors of adherence to COVID-19 prevention measure among communities in North Shoa zone, Ethiopia by using a health belief model. METHODS: Community-based cross-sectional study design was employed. A total of 683 respondents were interviewed using a structured and pre-tested questionnaire. The data were collected by using a mobile-based application called ""Google form."" Logistic regression was performed to analyze the data. Estimates were reported in adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and a significant association was declared at p-value of less than 0.05. RESULT: The overall adherence level of the community towards the recommended safety measures of COVID-19 was 44.1%. Self-efficacy (AOR = 0.23; 95% 0.14, 0.36), perceived benefits (AOR = 0.35; 95% 0.23, 0.56), perceived barriers (AOR = 3.36; 95% 2.23, 5.10), and perceived susceptibility of COVID-19 (AOR = 1.60; 95% 1.06, 2.39) were important predictors that influenced the adherence of the community to COVID-19 preventive behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the overall adherence level of the community towards the recommended safety measures of COVID-19 was relatively low. It is vital to consider the communities' self-efficacy, perceived benefits, perceived barriers and perceived susceptibility of COVID-19 in order to improve the adherence of the community towards the recommended safety measures of COVID-19.","Shewasinad Yehualashet, Sisay; Asefa, Kokebe Kefelegn; Mekonnen, Alemayehu Gonie; Gemeda, Belete Negess; Shiferaw, Wondimenh Shibabaw; Aynalem, Yared Asmare; Bilchut, Awraris Hailu; Derseh, Behailu Tariku; Mekuria, Abinet Dagnaw; Mekonnen, Wassie Negash; Meseret, Wondesen Asegidew; Tegegnework, Sisay Shine; Abosetegn, Akine Eshete",PLoS One,411,16

The aim of this study was to assess the cut-off scores proposed by the MALDI-TOF MS system for mycobacteria identification. A total of 693 clinical isolates from liquid media and 760 from solid media were analysed, encompassing 67 different nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) species. MALDI-TOF MS identified 558 (80.5%) isolates from liquid media and 712 (93.7%) isolates from solid media with scores &#8805;1.60. Among these, four (0.7%) misidentifications were obtained from liquid media and four (0.5%) from solid media. Regarding species diversity, MALDI-TOF MS successfully identified 64 (95.5%) different species, while PCR-reverse hybridization (GenoType CM/AS) identified 24 (35.8%) different species. With a MALDI-TOF MS score &#8805;2 all isolates were correctly identified, as well as most isolates in the range 1.60-1.99, except M. angelicum, M. parascrofulaceum, M. peregrinum, M. porcinum and M. gastri In conclusion, MALDI-TOF MS is a useful method for identifying a large diversity of NTM species. A score threshold of 1.60 proved useful for identifying almost all the isolates tested; only a few species required a higher score (&#8805;2.00) to obtain a valid definitive identification.","Rodriguez-Temporal, David; Rodríguez-Sánchez, Belén; Alcaide, Fernando",J. clin. microbiol,411,20

This is a particular type of regularization which adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients that can result in sparse models with few coefficients in which some coefficients can become zero and be eliminated. Larger penalties result in coefficient values closer to zero, which is ideal for producing simpler models. In this study, the lasso method has been applied to select variables affecting the recovery of the Covid-19 patients. The data consisted of the number of patients treated in several hospitals or clinics in China, recovered patients, demographics, comorbidities, symptoms, and treatment. The performance of the lasso binary logistic regression was compared with the full model of logistic and the stepwise logistic regression. The results showed that the number of independent variables selected by the lasso method was larger than those selected by the stepwise method. It has also been showed that coefficient values of variables produced by the lasso method were smaller than those produced by the stepwise. The independent variables that affect the cure rate of covid-19 patients with the lasso are gender, comorbidities, diabetes, cardiovascular, cough, fatigue, diarrhea, platelet count and antibiotics.","Rusyana, A.; Notodiputro, K.

In order to explore the effects of comorbid chronic diseases on clinical outcomes of COVID-19, a search was conducted in PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CDC, and NIH databases to April 25, 2020. A total of 24 peer-reviewed articles, including 10948 COVID-19 cases were selected. We found diabetes was present in 10.0%, coronary artery disease/cardiovascular disease (CAD/CVD) was in 8.0%, and hypertension was in 20.0%, which were much higher than that of chronic pulmonary disease (3.0%). Specifically, preexisting chronic conditions are strongly correlated with disease severity [Odds rati o (OR) 3.50, 95% CI 1.78 to 6.90], and being admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) (OR 3.36, 95% CI 1.67 to 6.76); in addition, compared to COVID-19 patients with no preexisting chronic diseases, COVID-19 patients who present with either diabetes, hypertension, CAD/CVD, or chronic pulmonary disease have a higher risk of developing severe disease, with an OR of 2.61 (95% CI 1.93 to 3.52), 2.84 (95% CI 2.22 to 3.63), 4.18 (95% CI 2.87 to 6.09) and 3.83 (95% CI 2.15 to 6.80), respectively. Surprisingly, we found no correlation between chronic conditions and increased risk of mortality (OR 2.09, 95% CI 0.26 to16.67). Taken together, cardio-metabolic diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension and CAD/CVD were more common than chronic pulmonary disease in COVID-19 patients, however, each comorbid disease was correlated with increased disease severity.

Even more important is the question of whether the virus can also enter and infect oocytes and possibly alter them in an unknown way, which could also affect the development and status of the human embryo. The answers to these questions are still poorly known, so we reviewed the human oocyte transcriptome and proteome obtained in our previous studies and found that human oocytes from the in vitro fertilization program expressed both the ACE2 and BSG genes and the corresponding ACE2 and BSG proteins. This means that human oocytes possess the molecular 'machinery' to facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entrance and infection. According to various studies, especially in animal models, different viruses can infect oocytes, so infection of the oocyte with SARS-Cov-2 cannot be completely ruled out. A hypothetical model of human oocyte infection with this virus has been proposed.","Virant-Klun, Irma; Strle, Franc",Stem Cell Rev Rep,411,16

Reactivation of HBV refers to an increase in the HBV load caused by chemotherapy in a patient with HBV infection. Reactivation of HBV is classified into 2 categories: reactivation in a carrier and reactivation in a patient with resolved HBV infection. Because hepatitis caused by HBV reactivation is more likely to become severe and makes the treatment of original diseases difficult, it is most important to prevent the onset of hepatitis. The basic strategy for prevention and treatment of HBV reactivation associated with powerful chemotherapy regimens should follow the guidelines for the management of hepatitis B virus infection by the Japan Society of Hepatology. Risk of HBV reactivation is determined by HBV infection status and the degree of immunosuppression. HBV infection status is classified into chronic active hepatitis, inactive carrier, and resolved infection. This corresponds, in descending order, to the risk of reactivation. Patients undergoing chemotherapy should be screened for HBV infection. HBsAg levels should be measured in all patients prior to commencement of treatment. In HBsAg-positive patients, HBeAg, anti-HBe antibody, and HBV DNA levels should also be measured. In HBsAg-negative patients, anti-HBc antibody and anti-HBs antibody should be measured. The next step for patients with resolved HBV infection is measurement of HBV DNA levels. In patients with resolved HBV infection whose HBV DNA level is 20 IU/mL or higher, as in inactive carriers, prophylactic therapy should be commenced before chemotherapy. In patients with resolved HBV infection whose HBV DNA level is less than 20 IU/mL, periodic monitoring of HBV DNA should be performed during and after chemotherapy. Preemptive therapy should be started immediately if the HBV DNA level ex- ceeds 20 IU/mL.","Takikawa, Hajime",Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,411,21

Objective: To develop a risk-based strategy for triaging mammograms during periods of decreased capacity. Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based cohort study used data collected prospectively from mammography examinations performed in 2014 to 2019 at 92 radiology facilities in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium. Participants included individuals undergoing mammography. Data were analyzed from August 10 to November 3, 2020. Exposures: Clinical indication for screening, breast symptoms, personal history of breast cancer, age, time since last mammogram/screening interval, family history of breast cancer, breast density, and history of high-risk breast lesion. Main Outcomes and Measures: Combinations of clinical indication, clinical history, and breast cancer risk factors that subdivided mammograms into risk groups according to their cancer detection rate were identified using classification and regression trees. Results: The cohort included 898â¯415 individuals contributing 1â¯878â¯924 mammograms (mean [SD] age at mammogram, 58.6 [11.2] years) interpreted by 448 radiologists, with 1â¯722â¯820 mammograms in individuals without a personal history of breast cancer and 156â¯104 mammograms in individuals with a history of breast cancer. Most individuals were aged 50 to 69 years at imaging (1â¯113â¯174 mammograms [59.2%]), and 204â¯305 (11.2%) were Black, 206â¯087 (11.3%) were Asian or Pacific Islander, 126â¯677 (7.0%) were Hispanic or Latina, and 40â¯021 (2.2%) were another race/ethnicity or mixed race/ethnicity. Cancer detection rates varied widely based on clinical indication, breast symptoms, personal history of breast cancer, and age. The 12% of mammograms with very high (89.6 [95% CI, 82.3-97.5] to 122.3 [95% CI, 108.1-138.0] cancers detected per 1000 mammograms) or high (36.1 [95% CI, 33.1-39.3] to 47.5 [95% CI, 42.4-53.3] cancers detected per 1000 mammograms) cancer detection rates accounted for 55% of all detected cancers and included mammograms to evaluate an abnormal mammogram or breast lump in individuals of all ages regardless of breast cancer history, to evaluate breast symptoms other than lump in individuals with a breast cancer history or without a history but aged 60 years or older, and for short-interval follow-up in individuals aged 60 years or older without a breast cancer history. The 44.2% of mammograms with very low cancer detection rates accounted for 13.1% of detected cancers and included annual screening mammograms in individuals aged 50 to 69 years (3.8 [95% CI, 3.5-4.1] cancers detected per 1000 mammograms) and all screening mammograms in individuals younger than 50 years regardless of screening interval (2.8 [95% CI, 2.6-3.1] cancers detected per 1000 mammograms). Conclusions and Relevance: In this population-based cohort study, clinical indication and individual risk factors were associated with cancer detection and may be useful for prioritizing mammography in times and settings of decreased capacity.","Miglioretti, Diana L; Bissell, Michael C S; Kerlikowske, Karla; Buist, Diana S M; Cummings, Steven R; Henderson, Louise M; Onega, Tracy; O039,; Meara, Ellen S; Rauscher, Garth H; Sprague, Brian L; Tosteson, Anna N A; Wernli, Karen J; Lee, Janie M; Lee, Christoph I",JAMA Netw Open,411,1

Patients in certain major stereotyped subsets often display remarkably consistent clinicobiological profiles, suggesting that the study of BcR IG stereotypy in CLL has important implications for understanding disease pathophysiology and refining clinical decision-making. Nevertheless, several issues remain open, especially pertaining to the actual frequency of BcR IG stereotypy and major subsets, as well as the existence of higher-order connections between individual subsets. In order to address these issues, we investigated clonotypic IGHV-IGHD-IGHJ gene rearrangements in a series of 29,856 patients with CLL, by far the largest series worldwide. We report that the stereotyped fraction of CLL peaks at 41% of the entire cohort and that all 19 previously identified major subsets retained their relative size and ranking, while 10 new ones emerged; overall, major stereotyped subsets had a cumulative frequency of 13.5%. Higher-level relationships were evident between subsets, particularly for major stereotyped subsets with unmutated IGHV genes (U-CLL), for which close relations with other subsets, termed 'satellites', were identified. Satellite subsets accounted for 3% of the entire cohort. These results confirm our previous notion that major subsets can be robustly identified and are consistent in relative size, hence representing distinct disease variants amenable to compartmentalized research with the potential of overcoming the pronounced heterogeneity of CLL. Furthermore, the existence of satellite subsets reveals a novel aspect of repertoire restriction with implications for refined molecular classification of CLL.","Agathangelidis, Andreas; Chatzidimitriou, Anastasia; Gemenetzi, Katerina; Giudicelli, Veronique; Karypidou, Maria; Plevova, Karla; Davis, Zadie A; Yan, Xiao-Jie; Jeromin, Sabine; Schneider, Christof; Pedersen, Lone Bredo; Tschumper, Renee; Sutton, Lesley A; Baliakas, Panagiotis; Scarfò, Lydia; van Gastel, Ellen J; Armand, Marine; Tausch, Eugen; Biderman, Bella; Baer, Constance; Bagnara, Davide; Navarro, Alba; de Septenville, Anne; Guido, Valentina; Mitterbauer-Hohendanner, Gerlinde; Dimovski, Aleksandar; Brieghel, Christian; Lawless, Sarah; Meggendorfer, Manja; Stranska, Kamila; Ritgen, Matthias; Facco, Monica; Tresoldi, Cristina; Visentin, Andrea; Patriarca, Andrea; Catherwood, Mark; Bonello, Lisa; Sudarikov, Andrey; Vanura, Katrina; Roumelioti, Maria; Skuhrova Francova, Hana; Moysiadis, Theodoros; Veronese, Silvio M; Giannopoulos, Krzysztof; Mansouri, Larry; Karan-Djurasevic, Teodora; Sandaltzopoulos, Raphael; Bödör, Csaba; Fais, Franco; Kater, Arnon P",Blood,411,1

Motivated by the challenges and unexpected pandemic disruptions, this paper aims to examine the performance indicators (PIs) of the resilient PSC and to predict the resilience level for a certain time period in the context of Bangladesh.Design/methodology/approachThe aim of this paper presents a structured framework based on the Delphi method, fuzzy DEMATEL (Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory) and system dynamics (SD). The proposed methodology was validated using expert's inputs from the relevant field in Bangladesh. This study reveals the influential relationships of indicators and resilience level using fuzzy DEMATEL and SD to improve the resiliency.FindingsFindings revealed that “Supply chain risk orientation”, “Visibility”, “Flexibility”, “Agility in supply chain” and “Collaboration” are the top five influential performance indicators for resilient PSC. The cause and effect relationship found that “IT capability”, “Flexibility”, “Supply chain network design”, “Resource availability”, “Supply chain risk orientation” and “Velocity” were in cause category which play a vital role for establishing resilient supply chain. SD approach has developed a model for predicting the resilience level of the supply chain.Originality/valueThis work is one of the initial contributions in the literature that has targeted on the identification and analysis of the significant PIs and predicting the resilience level of the PSC.","Karmaker, Chitra Lekha Ahmed Tazim",Modern Supply Chain Research and Applications,411,5

The spread of COVID-19 has been heterogeneous, resulting in some regions having sporadic transmission and relatively few hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and others having community transmission that has led to overwhelming numbers of severe cases. For these regions, health care delivery has been disrupted and compromised by critical resource constraints in diagnostic testing, hospital beds, ventilators, and health care workers who have fallen ill to the virus exacerbated by shortages of personal protective equipment. Although mild cases mimic common upper respiratory viral infections, respiratory dysfunction becomes the principal source of morbidity and mortality as the disease advances. Thoracic imaging with chest radiography and CT are key tools for pulmonary disease diagnosis and management, but their role in the management of COVID-19 has not been considered within the multivariable context of the severity of respiratory disease, pretest probability, risk factors for disease progression, and critical resource constraints. To address this deficit, a multidisciplinary panel comprised principally of radiologists and pulmonologists from 10 countries with experience managing patients with COVID-19 across a spectrum of health care environments evaluated the utility of imaging within three scenarios representing varying risk factors, community conditions, and resource constraints. Fourteen key questions, corresponding to 11 decision points within the three scenarios and three additional clinical situations, were rated by the panel based on the anticipated value of the information that thoracic imaging would be expected to provide. The results were aggregated, resulting in five main and three additional recommendations intended to guide medical practitioners in the use of chest radiography and CT in the management of COVID-19.","Rubin, Geoffrey D; Ryerson, Christopher J; Haramati, Linda B; Sverzellati, Nicola; Kanne, Jeffrey P; Raoof, Suhail; Schluger, Neil W; Volpi, Annalisa; Yim, Jae-Joon; Martin, Ian B K; Anderson, Deverick J; Kong, Christina; Altes, Talissa; Bush, Andrew; Desai, Sujal R; Goldin, Jonathan; Goo, Jin Mo; Humbert, Marc; Inoue, Yoshikazu; Kauczor, Hans-Ulrich; Luo, Fengming; Mazzone, Peter J; Prokop, Mathias; Remy-Jardin, Martine; Richeldi, Luca; Schaefer-Prokop, Cornelia M; Tomiyama, Noriyuki; Wells, Athol U; Leung, Ann N",Chest,411,1

The presence of persistent fatigue and impaired daily physical and cognitive function has led to speculation that like SARS-CoV-1 infection, COVID-19 will be followed by myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Methods and Results: We describe three adolescent and young adult patients who had confirmed or probable COVID-19 infections early on during the pandemic and were referred for evaluation to the Chronic Fatigue Clinic at the Johns Hopkins Children's Center. All patients reported orthostatic intolerance symptoms within the first 2 weeks of illness, and 10-min passive standing tests were consistent with postural tachycardia syndrome. After 6 months of illness, all three patients met criteria for ME/CFS. Clinical features of interest included strong histories of allergies in all three patients, two of whom had elevations in plasma histamine. Each demonstrated limitations in symptom-free range of motion of the limbs and spine and two presented with pathological Hoffman reflexes. These comorbid features have been reported in adolescents and young adults with ME/CFS. Conclusion: ME/CFS can be triggered by COVID-19 in adolescents and young adults. Further work is needed to determine the pathogenesis of ME/CFS after COVID-19 and optimal methods of treating these patients. Our preliminary study calls attention to several comorbid features that deserve further attention as potential targets for intervention. These include neuromuscular limitations that could be treated with manual forms of therapy, orthostatic intolerance and POTS for which there are multiple medications and non-pharmacologic therapies, treatable allergic and mast cell phenomena, and neurologic abnormalities that may require specific treatment. Larger studies will need to ascertain the prevalence of these abnormalities.","Petracek, L. S.; Suskauer, S. J.; Vickers, R. F.; Patel, N. R.; Violand, R. L.; Swope, R. L.; Rowe, P.

Most severe COVID-19 cases present low lymphocytes counts and high leukocytes counts, and accumulated evidence suggests that in a subgroup of patients presenting severe COVID-19, there may be a hyperinflammatory response driving a severe hypercytokinaemia which may be, at least in part, signalling the presence of an underlying endothelial dysfunction. In this context, available data suggest a prognostic role of neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in various inflammatory diseases and oncological processes. Following this rationale, we hypothesized that NLR, as a marker of endothelial dysfunction, may be useful in identifying patients with a poor prognosis in hospitalized COVID-19 cases. DESIGN: A retrospective observational study performed at Hospital Universitario HM Puerta del Sur, Madrid, Spain, which included 119 patients with COVID-19 from 1 March to 31 March 2020. Patients were categorized according to WHO R&D Expert Group. RESULTS: Forty-five (12.1%) patients experienced severe acute respiratory failure requiring respiratory support. Forty-seven (12.6%) patients died. Those with worse outcomes were older (P = .002) and presented significantly higher NLR at admission (P = .001), greater increase in Peak NLR (P < .001) and higher increasing speed of NLR (P = .003) compared with follow-up patients. In a multivariable logistic regression, age, cardiovascular disease and C-reactive protein at admission and Peak NLR were significantly associated with death. CONCLUSIONS: NLR is an easily measurable, available, cost-effective and reliable parameter, which continuous monitoring could be useful for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.","Jimeno, Sara; Ventura, Paula S; Castellano, Jose M; García-Adasme, Salvador I; Miranda, Mario; Touza, Paula; Lllana, Isabel; López-Escobar, Alejandro",Eur J Clin Invest,411,20

There is currently no approved therapeutics for treating COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein is considered a key therapeutic target by many researchers. Here we describe the identification of several monoclonal antibodies that target SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. One human antibody, CA521FALA, demonstrated neutralization potential by immunizing human antibody transgenic mice. CA521FALA showed potent SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. CA521FALA also demonstrated having a long half-life of 9.5 days in mice and 9.3 days in rhesus monkeys. CA521FALA inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in SARS-CoV-2 susceptible mice at a therapeutic setting with virus titer of the lung reduced by 4.5 logs. Structural analysis by cryo-EM revealed that CA521FALA recognizes an epitope overlapping with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-binding sites in SARS-CoV-2 RBD in the Spike protein. CA521FALA blocks the interaction by binding all three RBDs of one SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer simultaneously. These results demonstrate the importance for antibody-based therapeutic interventions against COVID-19 and identifies CA521FALA a promising antibody that reacts with SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein to strongly neutralize its activity.","Song, Deyong; Wang, Wenbo; Dong, Chuangchuang; Ning, Zhenfei; Liu, Xiu; Liu, Chuan; Du, Guangying; Sha, Chunjie; Wang, Kailin; Lu, Jun; Sun, Baiping; Zhao, Yanyan; Wang, Qiaoping; Xu, Hongguang; Li, Ying; Shen, Zhenduo; Jiao, Jie; Wang, Ruiying; Tian, Jingwei; Liu, Wanhui; Wang, Lan; Deng, Yong-Qiang; Dou, Changlin",Commun Biol,411,12

While there are limited data on the management of severe COVID-19 during pregnancy, information on pharmacological treatments of moderate COVID-19 is lacking. We report clinical outcomes of pregnant women hospitalized due to moderate COVID-19 illness treated with a 5-day course of remdesivir, antibiotics, and/or glucocorticoids. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Case series of pregnant women hospitalized with moderate symptoms of COVID -19 pneumonia at two INOVA Health System hospitals from April 1 to December 31, 2020. Primary outcome was clinical recovery (breathing on ambient air and/or hospital discharge) on hospital day 7 (HD7). Cox regression analysis was performed to evaluate which variables were associated with the primary outcome. RESULTS: Out of 748 pregnant women with confirmed infection by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, 35 were hospitalized due to moderate symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia (median gestational age 29 weeks). There was no maternal death. Seventeen patients received remdesivir within 48 hours of hospitalization: 15 remained with moderate symptoms and 2 (who also received glucocorticoids) had progressed to critical COVID-19 at remdesivir initiation; all 17 women in this group achieved clinical recovery on HD7. Seven women received remdesivir >48 hours following admission after they began treatment with glucocorticoids ± antibiotics and worsened to severe or critical disease; they all required supplemental oxygen on HD7. Eleven women were treated with antibiotics ± glucocorticoids but no remdesivir; on HD7, 3/11 achieved clinical recovery. Clinical recovery was significantly different among treatment groups; p < 0.001. When analyzing only women who remained with moderate symptoms at pharmacological treatments initiation, all 15 on remdesivir and only 3 of 11 on antibiotics achieved clinical recovery on HD7; p < 0.001. Delaying remdesivir for >48 hours after admission (HR 2.32, 95% CI 1.45-4.16) and >4-day duration of symptoms prior to hospitalization (HR 1.65, 95% CI 1.27-3.50) had an inverse association with clinical recovery. Incidental oligohydramnios was seen in 3/24 (12.5%) of women within 5 days of completing remdesivir treatment. Elevated transaminases was prevalent in women treated with remdesivir (8/24, 33.3%). CONCLUSION: In our cohort, prompt initiation of remdesivir in pregnant women hospitalized with moderate symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia within 48 hours of admission prevented worsening and allowed a fast clinical recovery by HD7. Deferring remdesivir for >48 hours after hospitalization and duration of symptoms >4 days before admission were independently associated with delayed clinical recovery and longer hospital admission. Ultrasound evaluation of the amniotic fluid in patients recovering from COVID-19 hospitalization should be considered.","Nasrallah, Sebastian; Nguyen, Anh Q; Hitchings, Laura; Wang, Jenny Q; Hamade, Sara; Maxwell, G Larry; Khoury, Alfred; Gomez, Luis M",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,411,9

With the introduction of worldwide lockdowns, consumer spending, workforce management and supply chains have been some of the areas most affected. These unexpected challenges force businesses to re-evaluate their strategies moving forward to mitigate the adverse impacts of the pandemic and adapt to the slowly evolving market conditions worldwide. The paper studies the effects of the pandemic on the UAE business environment and society through analyzing the employment growth rates of different sectors in the UAE for the first quarter of 2020 and compared it with their rates pre-pandemic (2010-2019). It was found that all sectors in the UAE suffered from negative growth, concluding that the pandemic has had a clear adverse economic effect on industries in the UAE. However, the uncertainty the pandemic has created has lead businesses to strategize for survival and, in doing so, focus more on organizational resilience and risk management. To steer clear from vulnerability and risk of business failure, an “entrepreneurial hustle” is needed to provide businesses with a competitive advantage in the post-pandemic era. This paper concludes with a hopeful observation that while many sectors in the UAE suffered economically, the UAE government's hands on initiatives to save businesses across the country has left many sectors on a stronger footing to withstand the after-effects post-pandemic era may throw their way. As result, this paper recommends economic diversification in the UAE to help transition its economy to a more sustainable path. © 2021.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate and analyze the public's attention to events related to COVID-19 in China at the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic (December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020) through the Sina Microblog hot search list. METHODS: We collected topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic on the Sina Microblog hot search list from December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020, and described the trend of public attention on COVID-19 epidemic-related topics. ROST Content Mining System version 6.0 was used to analyze the collected text for word segmentation, word frequency, and sentiment analysis. We further described the hot topic keywords and sentiment trends of public attention. We used VOSviewer to implement a visual cluster analysis of hot keywords and build a social network of public opinion content. RESULTS: The study has four main findings. First, we analyzed the changing trend of the public's attention to the COVID-19 epidemic, which can be divided into three stages. Second, the hot topic keywords of public attention at each stage were slightly different. Third, the emotional tendency of the public toward the COVID-19 epidemic-related hot topics changed from negative to neutral, with negative emotions weakening and positive emotions increasing as a whole. Fourth, we divided the COVID-19 topics with the most public concern into five categories: the situation of the new cases of COVID-19 and its impact, frontline reporting of the epidemic and the measures of prevention and control, expert interpretation and discussion on the source of infection, medical services on the frontline of the epidemic, and focus on the worldwide epidemic and the search for suspected cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our study found that social media (eg, Sina Microblog) can be used to measure public attention toward public health emergencies. During the epidemic of the novel coronavirus, a large amount of information about the COVID-19 epidemic was disseminated on Sina Microblog and received widespread public attention. We have learned about the hotspots of public concern regarding the COVID-19 epidemic. These findings can help the government and health departments better communicate with the public on health and translate public health needs into practice to create targeted measures to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19.","Zhao, Yuxin; Cheng, Sixiang; Yu, Xiaoyan; Xu, Huilan",J Med Internet Res,411,16

As the COVID-19 pandemic has continued to spread globally, increasing numbers of pregnant women have become infected, raising concern not only for their health but also for the health of their infants. This chapter discusses the effects of coronavirus infections, e.g., MERS, SARS, and COVID 19, on pregnancy and describes the evolving knowledge of COVID 19 among pregnant women. The physiological changes that occur in pregnancy, especially changes in the immune system, are reviewed in terms of their effect on susceptibility to infectious diseases. The effects of COVID-19 on the placenta, fetus, and neonate are also reviewed, including potential clinical outcomes and issues relating to testing and diagnosis. The potential mechanisms of vertical transmission of the virus between pregnant women and their infants are analyzed, including intrauterine, intrapartum, and postpartum infections. Several recent studies have reported the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in tissues from the fetal side of the placenta, permitting the diagnosis of transplacental infection of the fetus by SARS-CoV-2. Placentas from infected mothers in which intrauterine transplacental transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has occurred demonstrate an unusual combination of pathology findings which may represent risk factors for placental as well as fetal infection.","Schwartz, David A; Dhaliwal, Amareen",Adv Exp Med Biol,411,16

We then performed chemioluminescent serological assays (CLIA) and naso-pharyngeal swabs (NPS) in a randomized representative sample and in each subject with a positive rapid test. Factors associated with RICT IgG positivity were assessed by uni- and multivariate logistic regression models. Out of the 4143 participants, 918 (22·2%) showed RICT IgG positivity. In multivariable analysis, IgG positivity increases with age, with a significant non-linear effect (p = 0·0404). We found 22 positive NPSs out of the 1330 performed. Albeit relevant, the IgG prevalence is lower than expected and suggests that a large part of the population remains susceptible to the infection. The observed differences in prevalence might reflect a different infection susceptibility by age group.

METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey based on a questionnaire of 22 questions was conducted. RESULTS: A total of 3352 valid questionnaires were collected. Participants from Wuhan tended to be relatively psychologically affected and more concerned about future dental treatment. Toothbrushing frequency did not differ significantly between participants from Wuhan and other places and was associated with the prevalence of oral problems people encountered. Gingival bleeding, bad breath and oral ulcers were the three most common oral problems amid the epidemic, and significantly more participants in Wuhan experienced oral problems than other places in China. CONCLUSION: The three most common oral problems amid the epidemic were gingival bleeding, bad breath and oral ulcers.

Significant controversies exist regarding treatment modalities for this novel disease, especially in immunocompromised patients. Experience with management of COVID-19 in kidney transplant recipients is scarce; effects of this virus on immunosuppressed individuals are not well understood. METHODS: We identified 30 renal transplant recipients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia who were admitted to inpatient between March 2020 and April 2020. All patients received a 5-day course of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin; half of the patients received methylprednisolone. During hospitalization, calcineurin inhibitors and antimetabolites were held; prednisone was continued. RESULTS: Clinical presentation of flu-like symptoms was similar to those in the general population. Hyponatremia, lymphopenia, acute kidney injury, and elevated inflammatory markers were common. Over the course of follow-up, 23 have been discharged home with a functioning allograft and in stable condition; 4 experienced acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy; 7 patients were intubated, and 6 expired. The mortality rate in our cohort was 20%. CONCLUSION: Our findings described the characteristics and outcomes of this highly fatal illness in a multi-ethnic kidney transplant cohort, with insights on immunosuppression management that could further our understanding of this unique disease in immunocompromised populations.","Chen, Tracy Yixin; Farghaly, Sara; Cham, Samantha; Tatem, Luis Lantigua; Sin, Jonathan H; Rauda, Roberto; Ribisi, Maria; Sumrani, Nabil",Transpl Infect Dis,411,16

One of the main problem is the quickly and easy spreading of the virus. Healthcare workers are affected by nosocomial infections (also called as hospital-acquired infections) that exist in workplaces and more specifically, from health care equipment. In practice, the use of technology is quite common in health care settings. However, due to the touchability of mobile digital devices, their use contributes to nosocomial infections, according to several studies. Some applications based on tracking people have been implemented in order to facilitate Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and preventing contamination of surfaces by people's hands. Notwithstanding, their use still presents limitations related to implementing applications to be used in some hospital environments, such as care rooms, laboratories, clinical workrooms. To overcome these limitations, we propose the use of interpersonal distances and proxemic dimensions (i.e., Distance, Identity, Location, Movement, and Orientation - DILMO) for implementing HCI with mobile devices that reduces their touchability. The aim is to facilitate the development of mobile apps with proxemic HCI, supported in a proposed architecture, to stop spreading of nosocomial infection of COVID-19 and others. To show the usability and suitability of our proposal, we present two prototypes of apps for mobile devices as proof-of concept, using several combination of proxemic DILMO dimensions to model proxemic HCI that allow flexibility in interpersonal and devices people interactions.","Perez, P.; Roose, P.; Cardinale, Y.; Dalmau, M.; Masson, D.; Ieee,","2020 16th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications",411,16

To establish biomarkers for clinical, radiological, and laboratory severity of COVID-19 infection and to identify their relationships. Materials and methods. A retrospective study was carried out which included 155 patients undergoing treatment at the Hospital for War Veterans No. 3 with a confirmed diagnosis of novel coronavirus infection caused by nCoV from April 6 to June 10, 2020. All patients underwent clinical and laboratory examination. An intergroup statistical analysis of clinical and laboratory parameters was carried out depending on the criteria of clinical severity and severity of radiological signs of chest organ pathology according to computed tomography (CT). Results. Patients with mild COVID-19 showed a lower level of leukocytes, urea, creatinine, bilirubin, and aspartate dehydrogenase (AsAT), as opposed to the corresponding levels in patients with extremely severe course of the disease. A lower level of calcium in the peripheral blood was found in patients with severe COVID-19, along with an increase in blood glucose. Patients from the CT1 group as well as patients with a clinically mild course of the novel coronavirus infection had significantly lower levels of neutrophils, urea, creatinine, AsAT, and blood glucose and a higher level of blood calcium in comparison with patients with various CT patterns. In the group of patients with a fatal outcome, cardiovascular diseases were significantly more often detected, as opposed to the discharged patients. Conclusion. A number of biomarkers characterizing the severity of the novel coronavirus infection caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus have been identified. However, the revealed differences in the laboratory markers of the clinical and radiological severity of the disease do not currently allow to give a clear answer about the nature of the relationship between the clinical severity of the disease, CT findings, and laboratory indicators of COVID-19 severity. © 2021 Siberian State Medical University.

Considering the importance of the ongoing coronavirus crisis, we decided to evaluate genomes of all coronaviruses sequenced to date (stated more broadly, the order Nidovirales) to determine if they contain non-canonical nucleic acid structures. We discovered much evidence of putative G-quadruplex sites and even much more of inverted repeats (IRs) loci, which in fact are ubiquitous along the whole genomic sequence and indicate a possible mechanism for genomic RNA packaging. The most notable enrichment of IRs was found inside 5′UTR for IRs of size 12+ nucleotides, and the most notable enrichment of putative quadruplex sites (PQSs) was located before 3′UTR, inside 5′UTR, and before mRNA. This indicates crucial regulatory roles for both IRs and PQSs. Moreover, we found multiple G-quadruplex binding motifs in human proteins having potential for binding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Non-canonical nucleic acids structures in Nidovirales and in novel SARS-CoV-2 are therefore promising druggable structures that can be targeted and utilized in the future.","Bartas, Martin; Brázda, Václav; Bohálová, Natália; Cantara, Alessio; Volná, Adriana; Stachurová, Tereza; Malachová, Kateřina; Jagelská, Eva B.; Porubiaková, Otília; Červeň, Jiří; Pečinka, Petr",Front.

Many governments have intentionally not disclosed information or failed to do so in a timely manner, misled the public or even promoted false beliefs. Fierce public interest defenders are pushing back against this censorship. Dr Fen and Dr Wenliang were the first whistleblowers in China to report that a new pandemic was possibly underway, and ever since, numerous other whistleblowers around the world have been reporting on the spread of the virus, the lack of medical equipment and other information of public interest. This paper maps the relevant whistleblowing cases in China, the USA and Europe and shows that many whistleblowers are initially censored and face disciplinary measures or even dismissals. At the same time, whistleblowing during the COVID-19 pandemic has drawn public attention to the shortcomings of institutional reporting systems and a wider appreciation of whistleblowers as uniquely placed to expose risk at early stages. Ultimately, whistleblowing as a means of transparency is not only becoming ever less controversial, but during COVID-19 it has become the “remedy” to censorship.","Abazi, Vigjilenca",Eur. J.

Interventions to enable people to better cope with such distress should be based on the best available evidence. We therefore performed a scoping review to systematically identify and summarize the available literature of interventions that target the distress of people in the face of highly contagious disease outbreaks. METHODS: MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL, Web of Science (January 2000 to May 7, 2020), and reference lists were systematically searched and screened by two independent reviewers. Quantitative and qualitative studies investigating the effects of psychological interventions before, during, and after outbreaks of highly contagious emerging infectious diseases, such as SARS, MERS, Ebola, or COVID-19 were included. Study effects were grouped (e.g. for healthcare professionals, community members, people at risk) and intervention contents at the individual and organizational level summarized. We assessed the level of evidence using a modified scheme from the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine and the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council. RESULTS: Of 4030 records found, 19 studies were included (two RCTs). Most interventions were delivered during-exposure and face-to-face, focused on healthcare workers and crisis personnel, and combined psychoeducation with training of coping strategies. Based on two high-quality studies, beneficial effects were reported for resilience factors (e.g. positive cognitive appraisal) and professional attitudes of healthcare workers, with mixed findings for mental health (e.g. depression). Across all studies, there was positive qualitative feedback from participants and facilitators. We identified seven ongoing studies mostly using online- and mobile-based deliveries. CONCLUSIONS: There is preliminary evidence for beneficial effects of interventions to enable people to better cope with the distress of highly contagious emerging disease outbreaks. Besides the need for more high-quality studies, the summarized evidence may inform decision makers to plan interventions during the current pandemic and to develop pandemic preparedness plans.","Kunzler, Angela M; Stoffers-Winterling, Jutta; Stoll, Marlene; Mancini, Alexander L; Lehmann, Sophie; Blessin, Manpreet; Gilan, Donya; Helmreich, Isabella; Hufert, Frank; Lieb, Klaus",PLoS One,411,16

As of March 8, 2020, more than 90,000 cases were reported worldwide, resulting in a shortage of global medical resources. The purpose of this study was to understand the working experience of triage nurses in the emergency department (ED) of a large teaching general hospital in Shenzhen (Guangdong province, China) during the COVID-19 epidemic. This will provide a basis for improving the emergency nursing strategies and the epidemic response capabilities of triage nurse. METHODS: Ten triage nurses were selected as subjects by objective sampling for in- depth interviews, and the data were analyzed by the Colaizzi seven-step analysis method. RESULTS: There were four themes in the working experience of triage nurses, including fear of infection and transmission, job stress, gratitude, and expectations of managers. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19, the work experience of triage nurses mainly included the fear of infection and transmission, the high work pressure, the sense of team strength and the care of leaders. It was suggested that nursing managers should ensure the human resources of triage nurses, increase training, strengthen emergency drills, improve emergency nursing countermeasures, and improve the response capability of triage nurses during the epidemic.","Xu, Shihai; Yang, Qiaohong; Xie, Manying; Wang, Jin; Shan, Aijun; Shi, Fei",Int Emerg Nurs,411,15

Daily CO2 emissions are estimated from a diverse range of activity data, including: hourly to daily electrical power generation data of 29 countries, monthly production data and production indices of industry processes of 62 countries/regions, daily mobility data and mobility indices of road transportation of 416 cities worldwide. Individual flight location data and monthly data were utilised for aviation and maritime transportation sectors estimates. In addition, monthly fuel consumption data that corrected for daily air temperature of 206 countries were used for estimating the emissions from commercial and residential buildings. This Carbon Monitor dataset manifests the dynamic nature of CO2 emissions through daily, weekly and seasonal variations as influenced by workdays and holidays, as well as the unfolding impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Carbon Monitor near-real-time CO2 emission dataset shows a 7.8% decline of CO2 emission globally from Jan 1st to Apr 30th in 2020 when compared with the same period in 2019, and detects a re-growth of CO2 emissions by late April which are mainly attributed to the recovery of economy activities in China and partial easing of lockdowns in other countries. Further, this daily updated CO2 emission dataset could offer a range of opportunities for related scientific research and policy making.","Liu, Zhu; Ciais, Philippe; Deng, Zhu; Davis, Steven J.; Zheng, Bo; Wang, Yilong; Cui, Duo; Zhu, Biqing; Dou, Xinyu; Ke, Piyu; Sun, Taochun; Guo, Rui; Boucher, Olivier; Breon, Francois-Marie; Lu, Chenxi; Guo, Runtao; Boucher, Eulalie; Chevallier, Frederic",,411,2

To determine the effect of two doses BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccination schedule in individuals who recovered from COVID-19 (COVID-19 recovered) compared to naïve subjects, we evaluated SARS-CoV-2 Spike-specific T and B cell responses, as well as specific IgA, IgG, IgM and neutralizing antibodies titers in 22 individuals who received BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, 11 of which had a previous history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Evaluations were performed before vaccination and then weekly until 7 days post second injection. Data obtained clearly showed that one vaccine dose is sufficient to increase both cellular and humoral immune response in COVID-19 recovered subjects without any additional improvement after the second dose. On the contrary, the second dose is proved mandatory in naïve ones to further enhance the immune response. These findings were further confirmed at serological level in a larger cohort of naïve (68) and COVID-19 recovered (29) subjects, tested up to 50 days post vaccination. These results question whether a second vaccine injection in COVID-19 recovered subjects is required and indicate that millions of vaccine doses may be redirected to naïve individuals, thus shortening the time to reach herd immunity.","Mazzoni, Alessio; Di Lauria, Nicoletta; Maggi, Laura; Salvati, Lorenzo; Vanni, Anna; Capone, Manuela; Lamacchia, Giulia; Mantengoli, Elisabetta; Spinicci, Michele; Zammarchi, Lorenzo; Kiros, Seble Tekle; Rocca, Arianna; Lagi, Filippo; Colao, Maria Grazia; Parronchi, Paola; Scaletti, Cristina; Turco, Lucia; Liotta, Francesco; Rossolini, Gian Maria; Cosmi, Lorenzo; Bartoloni, Alessandro; Annunziato, Francesco",J. clin. invest,411,16

Efforts to slow viral transmission including quarantine and school closures have introduced profound changes in children's lives. Decreased opportunities for social interaction and physical activity, reduced instruction time impacting academic progress, changing nutritional habits and soaring rates of hunger, and increasing digital media use are just several of the myriad ways in which young people's lives have been altered. Emerging studies suggest that health and emotional wellbeing has been negatively impacted across developmental. There are many reasons to suspect that minoritized communities are particularly vulnerable, given the disproportionate toll COVID-19 has taken on the physical health and economic stability of Black, Latinx/Hispanic, and Native American communities who have experienced generations of structural racism and related health disparities. These indications of a percolating national and global crisis in children's mental health occur against a pre-COVID backdrop of inadequate health care infrastructure to meet the needs of children and families requiring mental health support. With these deeply concerning trends in mind, this month's Journal features new research from Penner et al.1 in which investigators found a protective effect of stay-at-home regulations on the mental health of a cohort of middle school students in the United States early in the pandemic. This study deserves our attention as we seek to understand the complex and evolving impacts of the pandemic upon youth mental health, and raises important questions about cultural, biological, and social factors that might contribute to resilience in specific youth and communities.","Biel, Matthew G; Hamrah, Olivia",J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry,411,32

METHODS: To this end, a population-based study, in the province of Udine (466,700 inhabitants, with age>15 years old, Friuli Venezia Giulia region, Italy) was planned. The primary outcome was the prevalence of COVID-19 in the first two months of the outbreak. All the rheumatic patients treated with biologic agents or small molecules in the last 6 months in our province were included (N=1051). RESULTS: From February 29 to April 25, 2020, 4 adult patients (4/1051, i.e. 3.8/1000, 95% Confidence Interval 1.5-9.7/1000) were registered as swab test positive by PCR for COVID-19. Overall, a total of 47/1051 (4.5%) cases were tested for COVID-19 by PCR in the same period, and 15 of them due to symptoms compatible with COVID-19. In the general population, the prevalence was 937 cases/466700 (2/1000, 95% Confidence Interval 1.9-2.1/1000, P-value=0.33, chi square test), and 20,179/466,700 (4.3%) swab tests for COVID-19 were performed. CONCLUSION: The risk of COVID-19 in rheumatic patients under biologic agents or small molecules does not appear different from that observed in the general population.

Therefore, the reaction of the cryptocurrency markets is important. News about epidemics affects investors' decisions. Panic index (PIndex) is an index created from news about the Covid 19 outbreak. In the study, it is used to measure the impact of decisions on the crypto money market. As cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin (BTC), Etherium (ETH), and Ripple (XRP), which have the highest transaction volume in the crypto money market, are included in the analysis. The relationship between Panic Index and the three major cryptocurrencies with the largest share in the cryptocurrency market was investigated by Ardl and Hatemi-J asymmetric causality test. Traditional causality tests acknowledge that the effects of positive and negative changes are the same. However, there may be asymmetric information and different investor behaviors in financial markets. In the study, Hatemi-J [1] Asymmetric Causality Test was conducted to examine the asymmetric relationship and symmetric relationship between Pindex and cryptocurrencies by separating them into positive and negative shocks. According to the results of the Hatemi-J causality analysis, positive shocks in the panic index are the cause of negative shocks for all cryptocurrencies. In other words, increases in the panic index are caused to fall the value of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple cryptocurrencies decrease. The results show that cryptocurrencies were not a safe haven for the investor during the Covid 19 period, as they acted similarly to other financial assets. © Copyright © 2021 Vurur.","Vurur, N.

After the U.S. emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic in March of 2020, reports of its effects on acute stroke care surfaced. This review examines the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on telestroke care delivery in a large telestroke network, spanning 36 states and 340 hospitals throughout the nation. Methods: For this retrospective observational study, data was reported from the internal medical record platform from three separate time periods - a year before the pandemic (March 2019 - May 2019), the three months immediately prior to the pandemic (December 2019 - February 2020), and the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. (March 2020 - May 2020). Two groups were studied, those seen in the emergency department (ED) with a suspected stroke diagnosis, and those who received alteplase in the ED. Results: The analysis revealed a decrease in patient volumes in both groups during the pandemic. The presentation time did not significantly vary between any of the stroke or alteplase groups. There was no significant difference in door-to-consult request times in the pandemic vs prior to the pandemic. The door-to-video time was shorter in the pandemic in alteplase patients compared to immediately prior (P=0.04), but not compared to 2019 (P=0.35). There was no significant difference in door-to-decision times or door-to-needle times in all of the groups. There was no difference in stroke severity in the alteplase group during the pandemic, but in the stroke group, stroke severity was higher during the pandemic (P&lt;0.01). Rates of thrombolysis did not decrease during the pandemic. Conclusion: COVID-19 has strained the U.S. emergency medical system and created unique challenges to treating patients with acute ischemic stroke. Likely due to the size and heterogeneity of the patient population, minimal adverse effects on telestroke process metrics were seen in this particular large teleneurology practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. This review highlights the resilience of our nation's stroke system of care to withstand the stressor of a worldwide pandemic.","Morton, J. L.; Didwania, S.; Anderson, E.; Hallock, J.",Stroke,411,16

Endocardial cells lining the interior of the heart are sensitive to these stimuli and respond by rearranging into luminal cells subjected to shear stress and abluminal cells not exposed to it. The mechanisms by which endocardial cells sense these dynamic biomechanical stimuli and how they evoke different cellular responses are largely unknown. Here, we show that blood flow activates two parallel mechanosensitive pathways, one mediated by Notch and the other by Klf2a. Both pathways negatively regulate the angiogenesis receptor Vegfr3/Flt4, which becomes restricted to abluminal endocardial cells.

The studies of MERS patients with severe disease and experimentally infected animals showed that robust viral replication and intensive proinflammatory response in lung tissues contribute to high pathogenicity of MERS-CoV. We sought to identify pattern recognition receptor (PRR) signaling pathway(s) that mediates the inflammatory cascade in human macrophages upon MERS-CoV infection. Methods: The potential signaling pathways were manipulated individually by pharmacological inhibition, small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) depletion, and antibody blocking. The MERS-CoV-induced proinflammatory response was evaluated by measuring the expression levels of key cytokines and/or chemokines. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay, flow cytometry analysis, and Western blotting were applied to evaluate the activation of related PRRs and engagement of adaptors. Results: MERS-CoV replication significantly upregulated C-type lectin receptor (CLR) macrophage-inducible Ca 2+-dependent lectin receptor (Mincle). The role of Mincle for MERS-CoV-triggered cytokine/chemokine induction was established based on the results of antibody blockage, siRNA depletion of Mincle and its adaptor spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), and Syk pharmacological inhibition. The cytokine and/or chemokine induction was significantly attenuated by siRNA depletion of retinoic acid-inducible-I-like receptors (RLR) or adaptor, indicating that RLR signaling also contributed to MERS-CoV-induced proinflammatory response. Conclusions: The CLR and RLR pathways are activated and contribute to the proinflammatory response in MERS-CoV-infected macrophages.","Zhao, Xiaoyu; Chu, Hin; Wong, Bosco Ho-Yin; Chiu, Man Chun; Wang, Dong; Li, Cun; Liu, Xiaojuan; Yang, Dong; Poon, Vincent Kwok-Man; Cai, Jianpiao; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; To, Kelvin Kai-Wang; Zhou, Jie; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",J.

More than 74.30 million confirmed cases of the COVID-19 have been reported globally so far, with an average fatality rate of almost 3.0%. Seven different types of coronaviruses had been detected from humans; three of them have resulted in severe outbreaks, i.e., MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. Phylogenetic analysis of the genomes suggests the possible occurrence of recombination between SARS-like-CoVs from pangolin and bat might have led to the origin of SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 outbreak. Coronaviruses are positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses and harbour a genome (30 kb) consisting of two terminal untranslated regions and twelve putative functional open reading frames (ORFs), encoding for non-structural and structural proteins. There are sixteen putative non-structural proteins, including proteases, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, other proteins involved in the transcription and replication of SARS-CoV-2, and four structural proteins, including spike protein (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N). SARS-CoV-2 infection, with a heavy viral load in the body, destroys the human lungs through cytokine storm, especially in elderly persons and people with immunosuppressed disorders. A number of drugs have been repurposed and employed, but still, no specific antiviral medicine has been approved by the FDA to treat this disease.

Combining them with HARPS radial velocities, as well as ground-based follow-up transit observations from MEarth and LCOGT telescopes, we measured for the inner planet, TOI-776b, a period of 8.25d, a radius of 1.83+-0.11Re, and a mass of 4.66+-0.97Me; and for the outer planet, TOI-776c, a period of 15.66d, a radius of 2.06+-0.13Re, and a mass of 6.1+-1.5Me. The Doppler data shows one additional signal, with a period of 35d, associated with the rotational period of the star. The analysis of fifteen years of ground-based photometric monitoring data and the inspection of different spectral line indicators confirm this assumption. The bulk densities of TOI-776b and c allow for a wide range of possible interior and atmospheric compositions. However, both planets have retained a significant atmosphere, with slightly different envelope mass fractions. Thanks to their location near the radius gap for M dwarfs, we can start to explore the mechanism(s) responsible for the radius valley emergence around low-mass stars as compared to solar-like stars. While a larger sample of well-characterized planets in this parameter space is still needed to draw firm conclusions, we tentatively estimate that the stellar mass below which thermally-driven mass loss is no longer the main formation pathway for sculpting the radius valley is between 0.63 and 0.54Msun. Due to the brightness of the star, the TOI-776 system is also an excellent target for the JWST, providing a remarkable laboratory to break the degeneracy in planetary interior models and to test formation and evolution theories of small planets around low-mass stars.","Luque, R.; Serrano, L.

Materials and methods In the present study, anonymised, residual stored plasma and serum specimens from SARS-CoV-2 RNA-positive (n=131) and presumed (pre-COVID-19) or RNA-negative (n=37) patients were taken from various time points with respect to the onset of symptoms. Applying a 21-day cut-off for the Abbexa device revealed performance that was very close to meeting the minimum sensitivity and specificity thresholds (98%) set by the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).5 The Abbexa device captures antibodies against both SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins, as opposed to Hangzhou, which targets only the nucleocapsid protein.2,6-8 We therefore propose that spike glycoprotein antibodies be considered as an additional moiety to test as part of the standard diagnostic approach towards SARS-CoV-2 antibody profiling9-10 to improve clinical sensitivity and potentially specificity, pending follow-up studies to confirm this approach. * Conflicts of interest None declared.","Linares, Christian Ryan Felicity Lowe Hannah Moses Samuel",Clinical Medicine,411,24

It is indispensable for the confirmation of airflow obstruction by spirometry in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) diagnosis. However, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has made it difficult for many clinics to perform spirometry as it may lead to possible aerosol infections. Thus, the diagnosis of COPD, especially in the early stage, has become difficult. To overcome this situation, JRS issued a ""Flowchart of Working Diagnosis and Management of COPD during the COVID-19 Pandemic"". This flowchart may help physicians provisionally diagnose COPD patients without performing spirometry, offering them appropriate intervention even in epidemic and pandemic situations.","Shibata, Yoko; Muro, Shigeo; Yokoyama, Akihito; Hashimoto, Shu",Respiratory investigation (Online),411,1

The sampling designs used are often biased in that they do not reflect the true underlying populations. For instance, individuals with strong symptoms are more likely to be tested than those with no symptoms. This results in biased estimates of prevalence (too high). Typical post-sampling corrections are not always possible. Here we present a simple bias correction methodology derived and adapted from a correction for publication bias in meta analysis studies. The methodology is general enough to allow a wide variety of customization making it more useful in practice. Implementation is easily done using already collected information. Via a simulation and two real datasets, we show that the bias corrections can provide dramatic reductions in estimation error.","Díaz-Pachón, Daniel Andrés; Rao, J Sunil",J Theor Biol,411,1

Understanding mechanisms that intrinsically modulate the immune responses to transplants is vital to develop rational treatment for rejection. Here, we have investigated the impact of programed cell death-1 (PD-1) protein, a negative co-stimulatory receptor, on the rejection of MHC incompatible kidney transplants in mice. T cells were found to rapidly infiltrate the kidneys of A/J mice transplanted to C57BL/6 mice, which peaked at six days and decline by day 14. The T cells primarily encircled tubules with limited infiltration of the tubular epithelium. Lipocalin 2 (LCN2), a marker of tubular injury, also peaked in the urine at day six and then declined. Notably, flow cytometry demonstrated that most of the T cells expressed PD-1 (over 90% of CD8 and about 75% of CD4 cells) at day six. Administration of blocking antibody to PD-L1, the ligand for PD-1, before day six increased T cell infiltrates and urinary LCN2, causing terminal acute rejection. In contrast, blocking PD-1/PD-L1 interactions after day six caused only a transient increase in urinary LCN2. Depleting CD4 and CD8 T cells virtually eliminated LCN2 in the urine in support of T cells injuring tubules. Thus, our data indicate that PD-1/PD-L1 interactions are not just related to chronic antigenic stimulation of T cells but are critical for the regulation of acute T cell responses to renal transplants.","Shim, Young Jun; Khedraki, Raneem; Dhar, Jayeeta; Fan, Ran; Dvorina, Nina; Valujskikh, Anna; Fairchild, Robert L; Baldwin, William M",Kidney int,411,26

As a key raw material for masks, meltblown fabrics play an important role in rejection of aerosols. However, the electrostatic dominated aerosol rejection mechanism of meltblown fabrics prevents the mask from maintaining the desired protective effect after the static charge degradation. Herein, novel reusable masks with high aerosols rejection efficiency were fabricated by the introduction of spider-web bionic nanofiber membrane (nano cobweb-biomimetic membrane). The reuse stability of meltblown and nanofiber membrane mask was separately evaluated by infiltrating water, 75% alcohol solution, and exposing under ultraviolet (UV) light. After the water immersion test, the filtration efficiency of meltblown mask was decreased to about 79%, while the nanofiber membrane was maintained at 99%. The same phenomenon could be observed after the 75% alcohol treatment, a high filtration efficiency of 99% was maintained in nanofiber membrane, but obvious negative effect was observed in meltblown mask, which decreased to about 50%. In addition, after long-term expose under UV light, no filtration efficiency decrease was observed in nanofiber membrane, which provide a suitable way to disinfect the potential carried virus. This work successfully achieved the daily disinfection and reuse of masks, which effectively alleviate the shortage of masks during this special period.","Wu, Junwei; Zhou, Hongjia; Zhou, Jingyi; Zhu, Xiao; Zhang, Bowen; Feng, Shasha; Zhong, Zhaoxiang; Kong, Lingxue; Xing, Weihong",,411,25

The World Health Organization released guidelines encouraging mothers with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 to breastfeed as the benefits of breastfeeding outweighs the possible risk of transmission. The objective of this study was to determine if SARS-CoV-2 was present in the breast milk of lactating mothers who had a positive SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab test prior to delivery, and the clinical outcomes for their newborns. STUDY DESIGN: This was a single-center, observational, prospective cohort study. Maternal-newborn dyads that delivered at New York University Langone Hospital Brooklyn with confirmed maternal SARS-CoV-2 positive screen test at the time of admission were recruited for the study. Breast milk samples were collected during postpartum hospitalization and tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 genes N1 and N2 by two-step reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Additionally, the clinical characteristics of the maternal newborn dyad, results of nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 testing, and neonatal follow-up data were collected. RESULTS: A total of 19 mothers were included in the study and their infants who were all fed breast milk. Breast milk samples from 18 mothers tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, and 1 was positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The infant who ingested the breast milk that tested positive had a negative nasopharyngeal test for SARS-CoV-2, and had a benign clinical course. There was no evidence of significant clinical infection during the hospital stay or from outpatient neonatal follow-up data for all the infants included in this study. CONCLUSION: In a small cohort of SARS-CoV-2 positive lactating mothers giving birth at our institution, most of their breast milk samples (95%) contained no detectable virus, and there was no evidence of COVID-19 infection in their breast milk-fed neonates. KEY POINTS: · Breast milk may rarely contain detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA and was not detected in asymptomatic mothers.. · Breast milk with detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA from a symptomatic mother had no clinical significance for her infant.. · Breast feeding with appropriate infection control instructions appears to be safe in mother with COVID infection..","Kunjumon, Bgee; Wachtel, Elena V; Lumba, Rishi; Quan, Michelle; Remon, Juan; Louie, Moi; Verma, Sourabh; Moffat, Michael A; Kouba, Insaf; Bennett, Terri-Ann; Mejia, Claudia Manzano De; Mally, Pradeep V; Lin, Xinhua; Hanna, Nazeeh",Am. j. perinatol,411,16

METHODS: A narrative review of the published research literature was undertaken, highlighting major empirical findings emerging during the first and second waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Interactions among biological, behavioral, and societal processes were prominent across all regions of the globe during the first year of the COVID-19 emergency. Affective, cognitive, behavioral, socioeconomic, and technological factors all played a significant role in the spread of infection, response precautions, and outcomes of mitigation efforts. Affective symptoms, suicidality, and cognitive dysfunction have been widely described consequences of the infection, the economic fallout, and the necessary public health mitigation measures themselves. The impact of COVID-19 may be especially serious for those living with severe mental illness and/or chronic medical diseases, given the confluence of several adverse factors in a manner that appears to have syndemic potential. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has made clear that biological and behavioral factors interact with societal processes in the infectious disease context. Empirical research examining mechanistic pathways from infection and recovery to immunological, behavioral, and emotional outcomes is critical. Examination of how emotional and behavioral factors relate to the pandemic-both as causes and as effects-can provide valuable insights that can improve management of the current pandemic and future pandemics to come.","Hall, Peter A; Sheeran, Paschal; Fong, Geoffrey T; Cheah, Charissa S L; Oremus, Mark; Liu-Ambrose, Teresa; Sakib, Mohammad N; Butt, Zahid A; Ayaz, Hasan; Jandu, Narveen; Morita, Plinio P",Psychosom Med,411,16

Our objective was to compare patients hospitalized for COVID-19 with cancer to those without cancer using national data and to study the effect of cancer on the risk of hospital death and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. (2) Methods: All patients hospitalized in France for COVID-19 in March-April 2020 were included from the French national administrative database, which contains discharge summaries for all hospital admissions in France. Cancer patients were identified within this population. The effect of cancer was estimated with logistic regression, adjusting for age, sex and comorbidities. (3) Results: Among the 89,530 COVID-19 patients, we identified 6201 cancer patients (6.9%). These patients were older and were more likely to be men and to have complications (acute respiratory and kidney failure, venous thrombosis, atrial fibrillation) than those without cancer. In patients with hematological cancer, admission to ICU was significantly more frequent (24.8%) than patients without cancer (16.4%) (p < 0.01). Solid cancer patients without metastasis had a significantly higher mortality risk than patients without cancer (aOR = 1.4 [1.3-1.5]), and the difference was even more marked for metastatic solid cancer patients (aOR = 3.6 [3.2-4.0]). Compared to patients with colorectal cancer, patients with lung cancer, digestive cancer (excluding colorectal cancer) and hematological cancer had a higher mortality risk (aOR = 2.0 [1.6-2.6], 1.6 [1.3-2.1] and 1.4 [1.1-1.8], respectively). (4) Conclusions: This study shows that, in France, patients with COVID-19 and cancer have a two-fold risk of death when compared to COVID-19 patients without cancer. We suggest the need to reorganize facilities to prevent the contamination of patients being treated for cancer, similar to what is already being done in some countries.","Bernard, Alain; Cottenet, Jonathan; Bonniaud, Philippe; Piroth, Lionel; Arveux, Patrick; Tubert-Bitter, Pascale; Quantin, Catherine",,411,16

Often, similar reforms are introduced concomitantly across countries. Although national policymakers would benefit from considering reform experiences abroad, exchange is limited. This paper provides an overview of health reform trends in 31 high-income countries in 2018 and 2019, i.e., before Covid-19. METHODS: Information was collected from national experts from the Health Systems and Policy Monitor network. Experts were asked to report on the three ""top"" national health reforms 2018 and 2019. In 2019, they provided an update of 2018 reforms. Reforms were assigned to one of 11 clusters and identified as one of seven different reform types. RESULTS: 81 reforms were reported in 28 countries in 2018. 44/81 went to four clusters: 'insurance coverage & resource generation', 'governance', 'healthcare purchasing & payment', and 'organisation of hospital care'. In 2019, 86 reforms in 30 countries were reported. 48/86 fell under 'organisation of primary & ambulatory care', 'governance', 'care coordination & specialised care', and 'organisation of hospital care'. Most 2018 reforms were reported ongoing in 2019; 27 implemented; seven abandoned. Health agency-led reforms were implemented most frequently, followed by central government-legislated reforms. CONCLUSIONS: Policymakers can leverage international experience of distinct reform approaches addressing similar challenges and similar approaches to address distinct problems. Such knowledge may help inspire or support future successful health reform processes.","Polin, Katherine; Hjortland, Maximilien; Maresso, Anna; van Ginneken, Ewout; Busse, Reinhard; Quentin, Wilm",Health policy,411,15
341092,341092,341092,Frequency and Risk Factors for Spontaneous Pneumomediastinum in COVID-19 Patients,17.342342,8.900498,2021,"A key safety measure encouraged by health authorities to avoid the SARS-CoV-2 spreading is the distance of one to two meters between people. This recommended two-meters distance is mainly based on short-distance contagion, when infected drops are expelled during a speech, coughing, or sneezing and directly hit another person. The dangerous form of airway contamination caused by droplets that remain suspended in the air for several hours has been almost ignored. However, the theoretical calculations performed in this work, recent experiments, and the accumulated knowledge in this and other epidemics indicate that, because of the airborne transmission, there is no safe distance to the coronavirus, either indoors or in open places. Recent investigations have confirmed not only the presence of the coronavirus in droplets suspended in the air but that these viruses remain active for several hours. Furthermore, significant indirect evidence of this means of transmission is the great difference in contagion between Brazilian regions in the current outbreak. While the Amazonian states have a contamination rate greater than 20%, in the southern states of the country this rate is less than 1%, despite high temperatures in the Northern region. Notwithstanding the social and economic differences between these regions, it seems that the extremely high humidity of the forest air prolongs the survival of the viruses in the drops in the external environment. Our theoretical calculations explain empirical observations from recent epidemiological studies and strengthen the need to use, not only a mask but also protective glasses throughout the population in the same way that they are mandatory for health professionals. Besides, our calculations show how air conditioning and heating systems can increase contagion. Finally, we suggest measures that could reduce the spread of the pandemic.","Crema, Edilson",,411,22

Chinese herbal medicine is incorporated into the Chinese national guideline for COVID-19 management, emphasising the individualisation of herbal treatment guided by pattern differentiation, which is an ICD-11-endorsed approach. However, this was not widely implemented with many provincial governments and hospitals developing their own guideline, suggesting the use of standardised herbal formulae and herbal active ingredients without pattern differentiation. Methods: Through the case study of COVID-19 guideline implementation, we compared the three approaches of developing Chinese herbal medicine, namely pattern differentiation-guided prescription, standardised herbal formulae, and herbal active ingredients, in terms of their strengths, limitations, and determinants of adoption. Results: Pattern differentiation-guided prescription is the practice style taught in the national syllabus among universities of Traditional Chinese Medicine in China, yet the lack of relevant diagnostic research reduces its reliability and hinders its implementation. Application of standardised herbal formulae is straightforward since the majority of clinical evidence on Chinese herbal medicine is generated using this approach. Nevertheless, it is downplayed by regulatory bodies in certain jurisdictions where the use of pattern differentiation is required in routine practice. Although herbal active ingredients may have clear in vitro therapeutic mechanisms, this may not be translated into real world clinical effectiveness. Conclusions: Multiple COVID-19 clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness and safety of Chinese herbal medicine prescribed using one of the three approaches described above are progressing. These results will demonstrate the comparative effectiveness among these approaches. Forthcoming clinical evidence from these trials should inform the updating process of the national guideline, such that its recognition and compliance may be strengthened. For longer-term development Chinese herbal medicine, serious investment for establishing high-quality clinical research infrastructure is urgently needed.","Chung, Vincent C H; Ho, Leonard T F; Wu, Irene X Y",Advances in integrative medicine (Print),411,1

A Case Series,16.9613,9.110274,2020,"With the widespread use of telemedicine services, automatic assessment of health conditions via telephone speech can significantly impact public health. This work summarizes our preliminary findings on automatic detection of respiratory distress using well-known acoustic and prosodic features. Speech samples are collected from de-identified telemedicine phonecalls from a healthcare provider in Bangladesh. The recordings include conversational speech samples of patients talking to doctors showing mild or severe respiratory distress or asthma symptoms. We hypothesize that respiratory distress may alter speech features such as voice quality, speaking pattern, loudness, and speech-pause duration. To capture these variations, we utilize a set of well-known acoustic and prosodic features with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for detecting the presence of respiratory distress. Experimental evaluations are performed using a 3-fold cross-validation scheme, ensuring patient-independent data splits. We obtained an overall accuracy of 86.4\% in detecting respiratory distress from the speech recordings using the acoustic feature set. Correlation analysis reveals that the top-performing features include loudness, voice rate, voice duration, and pause duration.","Rashid, Meemnur; Alman, Kaisar Ahmed; Hasan, Khaled; Hansen, John H.L.; Hasan, Taufiq",,411,6

Notre étude s’est déroulée auprès des professionnels travaillant dans les établissements de l’assistance publique des hôpitaux de Paris (AP–HP). Matériels et méthodes Des statistiques descriptives ont été réalisées sur les données de cette enquête transversale en ligne (15 juin–15 septembre 2020) représentative de l’ensemble des THN de l’AP–HP (pondération et calage sur marge) afin d’étudier les leurs perceptions et expériences liées à l’épidémie de COVID-19 et à sa gestion au sein de l’hôpital. Résultats Un total de 1127 participants ont été inclus (77,5 % de femmes, 54,0 % d’infirmières, 36,3 % d’aides-soignants ou techniciens, 4,3 % de sages-femmes, 0,8 % de cadres de santé et 4,6 % exerçant une autre profession).

Unfortunately, currently, there is no specific and effective treatment for COVID-19. As SARS-CoV-2 relies on its spike proteins (S) to bind to a host cell-surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme-2(ACE2), and this interaction is proved to be responsible for entering a virus into host cells, it makes an ideal target for antiviral drug development. In this work, we design three very short peptides based on the ACE2 sequence/structure fragments, which may effectively bind to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S protein and may, in turn, disrupt the important virus-host protein-protein interactions, blocking early steps of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Two of our peptides bind to virus protein with affinity in nanomolar range, and as very short peptides have great potential for drug development.","Odolczyk, Norbert; Marzec, Ewa; Winiewska-Szajewska, Maria; Poznanski, Jaroslaw; Zielenkiewicz, Piotr",Molecules (Basel),411,16

We implement an SEIR model to compute the infected population and number of casualties of this epidemic. The example may ideally regard the situation in the Italian Region of Lombardy, where the epidemic started on February 25. We calibrate the model with the number of dead individuals to date (May 5, 2020) and constraint the parameters on the basis of values reported in the literature. The peak occurs at day 37 (March 31) approximately, when there is a rapid decrease, with a reproduction ratio R0 = 3 initially, 1.36 at day 22 and 0.8 after day 35, indicating different degrees of lockdown. The predicted death toll is approximately 15600 casualties, with 2.7 million infected individuals at the end of the epidemic. The incubation period providing a better fit of the dead individuals is 4.25 days and the infection period is 4 days, with a fatality rate of 0.00144/day [values based on the reported (official) number of casualties]. The infection fatality rate (IFR) is 0.57 %, and 2.36 % if twice the reported number of casualties is assumed. However, these rates depend on the initially exposed individuals. If approximately nine times more individuals are exposed, there are three times more infected people at the end of the epidemic and IFR = 0.47 %. If we relax these constraints and use a wider range of lower and upper bounds for the incubation and infection periods, we observe that a higher incubation period (13 versus 4.25 days) gives the same IFR (0.6 versus 0.57 %), but nine times more exposed individuals in the first case. Therefore, a precise determination of the fatality rate is subject to the knowledge of the characteristics of the epidemic.","Carcione, Jose' M.; Santos, Juan E.; Bagaini, Claudio; Ba, Jing",,411,26

An adaptive strategy for the handling of thrombectomy for patients with large vessel occlusion has evolved at our center to optimize patient care while also minimizing risk of virus transmission. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of the new thrombectomy protocol by comparing thrombectomy times and patient outcomes during the pandemic and pre pandemic period. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on patients who underwent emergent thrombectomy from April 4th, 2020 to August 25th, 2020 (pandemic period) and between December 2nd, 2019 to April 3rd, 2020 (pre-pandemic period). The new protocol centered on a standardized approach to airway management in patients considered 'high-risk' for infection. An array of patient-specific factors and outcomes were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: A total of 126 patients were included in the study. There was no significant difference in door-to-recanalization or other time parameters between the two groups (138 minutes during the pandemic vs. 129 minutes pre-pandemic; p=0.37).

Variants in IFIH1, a gene coding the cytoplasmatic RNA sensor MDA5, regulate the response to viral infections. ObjectiveTo characterize the impact of IFIH1 rs199076 variants on host response and outcomes after severe COVID-19. MethodsPatients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) with confirmed COVID-19 were prospectively studied and rs1990760 variants determined. Peripheral blood gene expression, cell populations and immune mediators were measured. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy volunteers were exposed to an MDA5 agonist and dexamethasone ex-vivo, and changes in gene expression assessed. ICU discharge and hospital death were modelled using rs1990760 variants and dexamethasone as factors in this cohort and in-silico clinical trials. Measurements and Main Results227 patients were studied. Patients with the IFIH1 rs1990760 TT variant showed a lower expression of inflammation-related pathways, an anti-inflammatory cell profile and lower concentrations of pro-inflammatory mediators. Cells with TT variant exposed to a MDA5 agonist showed an increase in IL6 expression after dexamethasone treatment. All patients with the TT variant not treated with steroids (N=14) survived their ICU stay (HR 2.49, 95% confidence interval 1.29-4.79). Patients with a TT variant treated with dexamethasone (N=50) showed an increased hospital mortality (HR 2.19, 95% confidence interval 1.01-4.87) and serum IL-6. In-silico clinical trials supported these findings. ConclusionsCOVID-19 patients with the IFIH1 rs1990760 TT variant show an attenuated inflammatory response and better outcomes. Dexamethasone may reverse this anti-inflammatory phenotype.","Amado-Rodriguez, Laura; Riego, Estefania Salgado del; Ona, Juan Gomez de; Lopez-Alonso, Ines; Gil-Pena, Helena; Lopez-Martinez, Cecilia; Martin-Vicente, Paula; Lopez-Vazquez, Antonio; Lopez, Adrian Gonzalez; Cuesta-Llavona, Elias; Rodriguez-Garcia, Raquel; Boga, Jose Antonio; alvarez-Arguelles, Marta Elena; Mayordomo-Colunga, Juan; Vidal-Castineira, Jose Ramon; Crespo, Irene; Fernandez, Margarita; Criado, Loreto; Salvadores, Victoria; Jimeno-Demuth, Francisco Jose; Blanch, Lluis; Prieto, Belen; Fernandez-Fernandez, Alejandra; Lopez-Larrea, Carlos; Coto, Eliecer; Albaiceta, Guillermo M",,411,23

Annual administration of LAIV to this age group is costly and poses substantial logistical issues. This study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of prioritizing vaccination to age groups within the 2-16 year old age range to mitigate the operational and resource challenges of the current strategy. We performed economic evaluations comparing the influenza vaccination program from 1995-2013 to seven alternative strategies targeted at low risk individuals along the school age divisions Preschool (2-4 years old), Primary school (5-11 years old), and Secondary school (12-16 years old). These extensions are evaluated incrementally on the status quo scenario (vaccinating subgroups at high risk of influenza-related complications and individuals 65+ years old). Impact of vaccination was assessed using a transmission model from a previously published study and updated with new data. At all levels of coverage, all strategies had a 100% probability of being cost-effective at the current National Health Service threshold, £20,000/QALY gained. The incremental analysis demonstrated vaccinating Primary School children was the most cost-efficient strategy compared incrementally against others with an Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio of £639 spent per QALY gained (Net Benefit: 404 M£ [155, 795]). When coverage was varied between 30%, 55%, and 70% strategies which included Primary school children had a higher probability of being cost-effective at lower willingness-to-pay levels. Although children were the vaccine target the majority of QALY gains occurred in the 25-44 years old and 65+ age groups. Influenza strain A/H3N2 incurred the greatest costs and QALYs lost regardless of which strategy was used. Improvement could be made to the current LAIV pediatric vaccination strategy by eliminating vaccination of 2-4 year olds and focusing on school-based delivery to Primary and Secondary school children in tandem.","Wenzel, Natasha S; Atkins, Katherine E; van Leeuwen, Edwin; Halloran, M Elizabeth; Baguelin, Marc",Vaccine,411,16

Wellens syndrome, or left anterior descending T-wave syndrome, is diagnosed by a pattern of electrocardiographic (ECG) changes that include inverted or biphasic T waves in leads V2-V3. CASE REPORT A 75-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a 1-week history of fatigue and progressive shortness of breath who acutely decompensated, necessitating mechanical ventilator support. Initial lab workup revealed COVID-19 positivity, which was confirmed by repeat testing. A routine ECG obtained during her hospitalization and compared with her baseline revealed diffuse T-wave inversions of her precordial leads, which was highly suggestive of Wellens syndrome. Cardiac enzymes obtained were slightly elevated and an echocardiogram did not demonstrate wall motion abnormalities. The patient was initiated on non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction protocol with heparin infusion for 48 hours and dual antiplatelet therapy, in addition to beta blockade. Repeat ECGs showed complete resolution of Wellens syndrome shortly after therapy. CONCLUSIONS Although rare, Wellens syndrome is a significant indicator of left anterior descending artery stenosis and is commonly associated with acute medical illness. COVID-19 pneumonia has been associated with many adverse cardiovascular outcomes, with ischemia and arrhythmia becoming increasingly more common. Diagnosis of Wellens often includes coronary angiography; however, during the current pandemic, many authorities have recommended medical management alone during the acute phase of care, depending on the severity of concomitant illness.","Prousi, George S; Giordano, Jacob; McCann, Patrick J",Am J Case Rep,411,1

Lack of targeted therapeutics and vaccines for COVID-2019 have triggered the scientific community to develop new vaccines or drugs against this novel virus. Many synthetic compounds and antimalarial drugs are undergoing clinical trials. The traditional medical practitioners widely use Indian medicinal plant Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha) natural constituents, called withanolides for curing various diseases. The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 plays a vital role in disease propagation by processing the polyproteins which are required for its replication. Hence, it denotes a significant target for drug discovery. In the present study, we evaluate the potential of 40 natural chemical constituents of Ashwagandha to explore a possible inhibitor against main protease of SARS-CoV-2 by adopting the computational approach. The docking study revealed that four constituents of Ashwagandha; Withanoside II (-11.30 Kcal/mol), Withanoside IV (-11.02 Kcal/mol), Withanoside V (-8.96 Kcal/mol) and Sitoindoside IX (-8.37 Kcal/mol) exhibited the highest docking energy among the selected natural constituents. Further, MD simulation study of 100 ns predicts Withanoside V possess strong binding affinity and hydrogen-bonding interactions with the protein active site and indicates its stability in the active site. The binding free energy score also correlates with the highest score of -87.01 ± 5.01 Kcal/mol as compared to other selected compounds. In conclusion, our study suggests that Withanoside V in Ashwagandha may be serve as a potential inhibitor against Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 to combat COVID-19 and may have an antiviral effect on nCoV.

The global medical crisis arising from the worldwide spread of COVID-19 is predicted to lead to a global economic crisis and subsequent deep depression. The resultant economic, social and political repercussions are likely to be felt for years or even decades to come, equalling the great depression of the last century. Consequently, it is difficult to make long-term accurate predictions about the impact of new technologies on industry, society, and labour. In this context, the aim of this introductory article to the themed volume is to consider the potential challenges and opportunities associated with the Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies and potential impacts on work and workplaces. This introductory article comprises an international collection of research that examines the impact of technological change on employment and working conditions with consideration given to the additional impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.

Military healthcare workers in China have experienced many pressures when combating COVID-19. This study aimed to investigate the current psychological status and associated risk factors among military healthcare workers. METHODS: We collected data from 194 military healthcare workers from three inpatient wards in two specialized COVID-19 hospitals using a web-based cross-sectional survey. The survey covered demographic information, the patient health questionnaire-9, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, and the patient health questionnaire-15. Hierarchical regression analysis was used to explore potential risk factors for mental health problems. RESULTS: The overall prevalence rates of depressive, generalized anxiety, and somatic symptoms were 37.6%, 32.5%, and 50%, respectively. Rates of severe depression, generalized anxiety, and somatic symptoms were 5.2%, 3.6%, and 15.5%, respectively. In 22.7% of cases, comorbidities existed between depression, generalized anxiety, and somatization. A junior-grade professional title was associated with depression, older age was associated with generalized anxiety and somatization, and short sleep duration and poor sleep quality were associated with all three symptoms. DISCUSSION: The prevalence of depression, generalized anxiety, and somatic symptoms among military healthcare workers in specialized COVID-19 hospitals is high during the current COVID-19 outbreak. A junior-grade professional title, older age, short sleep duration, and poor sleep quality significantly affect military healthcare workers' mental health. Continuous surveillance and monitoring of the psychological consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak should be routine to promote mental health among military healthcare workers.","Pan, Xiao; Xiao, Ying; Ren, Ding; Xu, Zheng-Mei; Zhang, Qian; Yang, Li-Ying; Liu, Fen; Hao, Yu-Shi; Zhao, Feng; Bai, Yong-Hai",Asia Pac Psychiatry,411,16

There are two recognizable learning environments for students, namely, classroom environment and laboratory environment. With the COVID-19 pandemic, both environments merged to online environments, impacting students' development of processes and characteristic attitudes. This paper introduces a theoretical framework based on experiential learning to plan and deliver processes through an online environment. A case study based on the power factor correction experiment was presented. The traditional experiment that runs for 3 hours was broken into smaller tasks such as a pre-lab activity, a simulation exercise, a PowerPoint presentation, a remote laboratory activity, and a final report based on the experiential learning approach. A questionnaire that carries close and open-ended questions were administered to obtain students' reflections about developing the processes through an online-friendly experiential learning approach. The majority of the students like the approach followed and praise for providing them with an opportunity to perform the experiment in a novel way during the COVID-19 situation.","Kularatne, W.

However, we have encountered acute arterial and venous thrombotic events after COVID-19 infection. Managing acute thrombotic events from the novel virus has presented unprecedented challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. In our study, we have highlighted the unique treatment required for these patients and discussed the role of anticoagulation for patients diagnosed with COVID-19. METHODS: The data from 21 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 disease and acute venous or arterial thrombosis were collected. The demographics, comorbidities, home medications, laboratory markers, and outcomes were analyzed. The primary postoperative outcome of interest was mortality, and the secondary outcomes were primary patency and morbidity. To assess for significance, a univariate analysis was performed using the Pearson &#967;2 and Fisher exact tests for categorical variables and the Student t test for continuous variables. RESULTS: A total of 21 patients with acute thrombotic events met our inclusion and exclusion criteria. Most cases were acute arterial events (76.2%), with the remainder venous cases (23.8%). The average age for all patients was 64.6 years, and 52.4% were male. The most prevalent comorbidity in the group was hypertension (81.0%). Several markers were markedly abnormal in both arterial and venous cases, including an elevated neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (8.8) and D-dimer level (4.9 µg/mL). Operative intervention included percutaneous angiography in 25.00% of patients and open surgical embolectomy in 23.8%. Most of the patients who had undergone arterial intervention had developed a postoperative complication (53.9%) compared with a 0% complication rate after venous interventions. Acute kidney injury on admission was a factor in 75.0% of those who died vs 18.2% in the survivors (P = .04). CONCLUSIONS: We have described our experience in the epicenter of the pandemic of 21 patients who had experienced major thrombotic events from infection with COVID-19. The findings from our cohort have highlighted the need for increased awareness of the vascular manifestations of COVID-19 and the important role of anticoagulation for these patients. More data are urgently needed to optimize treatment and prevent further vascular complications of COVID-19 infections.","Ilonzo, Nicole; Rao, Ajit; Safir, Scott; Vouyouka, Ageliki; Phair, John; Baldwin, Melissa; Ting, Windsor; Soundararajan, Krishna; Han, Daniel; Tadros, Rami; Marin, Michael; Faries, Peter",J. vasc. surg,411,26

Promising vaccines being developed include replication-competent platforms, which are typically contraindicated during pregnancy because of theoretical risk. However, replicating vaccines are administered in and around pregnancy, either inadvertently because of unknown pregnancy status or when recommended.The historical cases of Ebola virus, yellow fever, and rubella demonstrate that contradictory messages around the safety of live vaccines in pregnancy have critical public health costs. First, restricting study or use of replicating vaccines in pregnancy may delay or deny access to the only available protection against deadly diseases. Additionally, not vaccinating pregnant people may slow epidemic control. Finally, uncertainty and worry around the safety of live vaccines may lead to terminations of otherwise desired pregnancies after inadvertent vaccination in pregnancy.If one of the vaccines deployed to combat the current global COVID-19 pandemic is replication competent, historical cases offer important lessons for ethical and effective protection for pregnant populations.","Jaffe, Elana; Goldfarb, Ilona Telefus; Lyerly, Anne Drapkin",Am J Public Health,411,1

The delivery, management, and coordination of nursing care services, provided via telecommunications technology, is a convenient method of delivering health care to patients recovering from stroke. It is important to assess the service quality of the telehealth process and to establish the role of telehealth nursing and related technologies in the care of patients recovering from stroke. Studies show that even though both health professionals and participants have reported high levels of satisfaction and acceptance of telerehabilitation interventions, the quality of the evidence on telerehabilitation in poststroke care remains low. Conducting a quality study of telehealth rehabilitation for patients recovering from stroke will help assess if home health agencies with telehealth capabilities caring for patients recovering from stroke and patients with chronic diseases can provide quality care to patients in their home and fill this health care gap. Patients that are severely handicapped and impaired and unable to reside in their home environment are not included in telerehabilitation services provided by the home care agency. It would be informative to study the benefits of telerehabilitation and the care provided to patients recovering from stroke within nursing homes, given the need for social distancing to reduce disease transmission during the current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) global health pandemic. Using telerehabilitation would mean that patients have a lower risk of exposure to infectious agents.

This systematic review aimed to summarize evidence on the risk of infection, severe illness and death from COVID-19 in people with asthma. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION: A comprehensive search of electronic databases including preprint repositories and WHO COVID-19 database was conducted (until 26 May 2020). Studies reporting COVID-19 in people with asthma were included. For binary outcomes, we performed Sidik-Jonkman random effects meta-analysis. We explored quantitative heterogeneity by subgroup analyses, meta regression and evaluating the I2 statistic. RESULTS: Fifty-seven studies with an overall sample size of 587 280 were included. The prevalence of asthma among those infected with COVID-19 was 7.46% (95% CI = 6.25-8.67). Non-severe asthma was more common than severe asthma (9.61% vs. 4.13%). Pooled analysis showed a 14% risk ratio reduction in acquiring COVID-19 (95% CI = 0.80-0.94; p < 0.0001) and 13% reduction in hospitalization with COVID-19 (95% CI = 0.77-0.99, p = 0.03) for people with asthma compared with those without. There was no significant difference in the combined risk of requiring admission to ICU and/or receiving mechanical ventilation for people with asthma (RR = 0.87 95% CI = 0.94-1.37; p = 0.19) and risk of death from COVID-19 (RR = 0.87; 95% CI = 0.68-1.10; p = 0.25). CONCLUSION: The findings from this study suggest that the prevalence of people with asthma among COVID-19 patients is similar to the global prevalence of asthma. The overall findings suggest that people with asthma have a lower risk than those without asthma for acquiring COVID-19 and have similar clinical outcomes.","Sunjaya, Anthony P; Allida, Sabine M; Di Tanna, Gian Luca; Jenkins, Christine",J Asthma,411,16

While much of the current antibody and vaccine research focuses on the receptor-binding domain of S1, a less-recognized opportunity is to harness the potential benefits of the more conserved S2 subunit. Similarities between the spike proteins of both SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1 warrant exploring S2. Possible benefits of employing S2 in therapies and vaccines include the structural conservation of S2, extant cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies in populations (due to prior exposure to common cold coronaviruses), the steric neutralization potential of antibodies against S2, and the stronger memory B-cell and T-cell responses. More research is necessary on the effect of glycans on the accessibility and stability of S2, SARS-CoV-2 mutants that may affect infectivity, the neutralization potential of antibodies produced by memory B-cells, cross-reactive T-cell responses, antibody-dependent enhancement, and antigen competition. This perspective aims to highlight the evidence for the potential advantages of using S2 as a target of therapy or vaccine design.","Shah, Priyanka; Canziani, Gabriela A; Carter, Erik P; Chaiken, Irwin",Front Immunol,411,16

Thus, new therapeutic strategies and effective vaccines are urgently needed to cope with this severe pandemic. The development of a broadly neutralizing antibody against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is one of the attractive treatment strategies for COVID-19. Currently, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein is the main target of neutralizing antibodies when SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells through an interaction between the S protein and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expressed on various human cells. A single monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment is prone to selective pressure due to increased possibility of targeted epitope mutation, leading to viral escape. In addition, the antibody-dependent enhancement effect is a potential risk of enhancing the viral infection. These risks can be reduced using multiple mAbs that target nonoverlapping epitopes. Thus, a cocktail therapy combining two or more antibodies that recognize different regions of the viral surface may be the most effective therapeutic strategy.","Lai, Rongtao; Zhou, Tianhui; Xiang, Xiaogang; Lu, Jie; Xin, Haiguang; Xie, Qing",Front.

Demographics, comorbidities, medication history, investigations, management and outcomes were analysed. Results: Twelve patients were identified. Demographic analysis revealed (all median [IQR]);Age 59.5 [51.5-69.3] years, body mass index 27.4 [26.0-28.9] kg/m2 and length of admission 21.5 [7.5-28.8] days. The majority of patients were male (9/12) and most were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (9/12). Seven patients had no diabetes symptoms prior to admission and positive family history was uncommon (1/12). Median glucose reading on admission was 16.0 [10.0-29.0] mmol/l, HbA1c 62.5 [47-104] mmol/mol. During admission, median percentage of glucose in target (5-15 mmol/l) for individual patients was 71.6 [46.4-91.0]% and median percentage of glucose levels in hypoglycaemic range (&lt;4 mmol/l) was 0.8 [0.0-2.6]%.

On multivariate analysis, peak serum C-peptide level on a GST, diabetic ketoacidosis, age and HbA1c level at diagnosis were associated with residual ß-cell function over time. CONCLUSIONS: Peak serum C-peptide levels on a GST conducted soon after diagnosis in Japanese children with type 1 diabetes could predict the time to decrease in postprandial serum C-peptide values to less than 0.20 ng/mL.

Accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 using molecular assays is critical for patient management and the control of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is an increasing number of SARS-CoV-2 viruses with mutations at the primer or probe binding sites, and these mutations may affect the sensitivity of currently available real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays targeting the nucleocapsid (N), envelope (E), and open reading frame 1a or 1b genes. Using sequence-independent single-primer amplification and nanopore whole-genome sequencing, we have found that the nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) gene, located at the 5' end of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, was highly expressed in the nasopharyngeal or saliva specimens of 9 COVID-19 patients of different clinical severity. Based on this finding, we have developed a novel nsp1 real-time RT-PCR assay. The primers and probes are highly specific for SARS-CoV-2. Validation with 101 clinical specimens showed that our nsp1 RT-PCR assay has a sensitivity of 93.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 86.2%-97.2%), which was similar to those of N and E gene RT-PCR assays. The diagnostic specificity was 100% (95% CI: 92.9%-100%).

Two paths of neural layers are performed to extract image features and clinical features, respectively, and at the same time clinical features are employed as the attention to guide the extraction of image features. Finally, these two modalities of features are concatenated to make decisions. We evaluate the proposed method on its applications to Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, mild cognitive impairment converter prediction and hepatic microvascular invasion diagnosis. The encouraging experimental results prove the values of the image feature extraction guided by clinical features and the concatenation of two modalities of features for classification, which improve the performance of diagnosis effectively and stably.","Yang, Songxiao; Liu, Xiabi; Zheng, Zhongshu; Wang, Wei; Ma, Xiaohong",,411,24

The ATP has outlined specific training objectives;however, there is minimal guidance on the specific implementation of the objectives presumably to allow for differences in training environments. Mentorship requires a significant time investment, therefore designing an experience that is mutually beneficial for the mentor and trainee is critical to ensuring engagement and success. Additionally, in consideration of the unanticipated shift in education to a virtual format due to COVID-19, a critical review of virtual didactic content is essential to ensuring student learners are given the same, high-quality curricular content. Therefore, we suggest three areas of anatomy curriculum review, 1) appraisal of course design, 2) resource optimization, and 3) assessment development, that if appropriately aligned with ATP learning objectives, can enhance the experience of the trainee, align with quality improvement of anatomy pedagogy for the mentor, and result in an improved student engagement within a hybrid course model. Methods In consideration of the ATP objectives, we engaged in structured learning events performing an appraisal of course materials, critically assessing student learning resources and developing learning assessments, in a mentor-guided approach, that included the integration of Bloom's Taxonomy. Results Prior to starting the ATP, we created an intentional plan for curriculum review informed by the trainee's perspective and needs of the mentor in the following three areas: Appraisal of course design The trainee engaged in a critical review of pre-recorded didactic lectures and assessed for the saliency of information and resources. Resource optimization There has been an exponential increase in the availability of resources for learning and teaching anatomy, however, all resources are not equally suited for teaching anatomy for medical professionals. The mentor and trainee worked together to optimize the dissection guide for a 10-week Doctor of Physical Therapy program. This allowed for better alignment of dissection content and addition of virtual learning resources to improve the clinical context of dissection for students. Assessment The trainee created assessment questions, using Bloom's taxonomy, in order to ensure that the exam questions aligned with the rigor of the curriculum and expected outcomes. Conclusion & Significance The ATP does not state course design, resource optimization, and assessment development as the explicit goals of the program. However, in the context of the objectives, it does appear that a ?hidden curriculum? within the program can be mutually beneficial if the Mentor-Trainee partnership makes an intentional effort to align the goals of the ATP with mentor needs for course quality improvement.","Stringham, Nicole Simmons Gabrielle Horn Maggie",The FASEB Journal,411,0

We propose a deep learning based training scheme, inspired by domain adaptation techniques, which uses an iterative update approach to aim to create scanner-invariant features while simultaneously maintaining performance on the main task of interest, thus reducing the influence of scanner on network predictions. We demonstrate the framework for regression, classification and segmentation tasks with two different network architectures. We show that not only can the framework harmonise many-site datasets but it can also adapt to many data scenarios, including biased datasets and limited training labels. Finally, we show that the framework can be extended for the removal of other known confounds in addition to scanner. The overall framework is therefore flexible and should be applicable to a wide range of neuroimaging studies.","Dinsdale, Nicola K; Jenkinson, Mark; Namburete, Ana I L",Neuroimage,411,24

Older individuals are at higher risk compared with younger adults and children due to the presence of weaker immune functions. Healthcare workers are also at higher risk due to close proximity with the infected cases. Proper precautions and hand hygiene techniques can prevent the transmission of the disease. There is a dearth of evidence on how to manage the disease; therefore, protective measures might help to reduce the spread of infection. This article aimed to evaluate the preventive measure and use of protective equipment among healthcare workers and community settings.

The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan is one of the countries where relatively strict lockdown measures were enforced. This study aims to evaluate the impact of the lockdown circumstances in Jordan on antenatal care services and health circumstances of pregnant women during this period. Participants and Methods: This study involved a cross-sectional survey of Jordanian women who are currently pregnant. An electronic survey was distributed among pregnant women in Jordan. A total of 944 completed responses were returned and analyzed. The sample size was statistically determined to be representative of the population. Results: The results revealed a significant increase in the percentage of pregnant women not receiving antenatal care from 4% to 59.53% (p<0.001) during the lockdown period, despite the fact that some of these women were suffering from significant underlying medical conditions or serious pregnancy complications that require close antenatal surveillance. The survey also demonstrated that the lockdown circumstances impacted the physical, social, and mental wellbeing of the participants. Conclusion: Although the lockdown measures in Jordan have succeeded so far in relative containment of COVID-19, this research suggests that significant disruption to antenatal services has occurred and that the lockdown has affected the wellbeing of pregnant women in a number of aspects, which has the potential to cause antenatal health issues that are not directly related to the spread of COVID-19, but rather are a side effect of the way in which the outbreak is managed.","Muhaidat, Nadia; Fram, Kamil; Thekrallah, Fida; Qatawneh, Ayman; Al-Btoush, Ala039",Int J Womens Health,411,29

Whilst global information and transparency have reached unparalleled levels, we still seem to be taken by surprise with sudden shocks and crisis. In some cases this is due to the deep or extreme uncertainty, i.e. in case of events that are so unique that they are genuinely unprecedented or extremely rare (think of a ‘planet killer’ meteorite striking Earth), or high impact—low probability risks that do not get prioritized by political decision-makers as preparedness priorities. The COVID-19 pandemic appears to be a good example of the latter. Whilst experts were warning governments (for instance the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board in a September 2019 report [1]) about an influenza pandemic involving a high-impact respiratory pathogen and criticized them about the lack of preparedness for such an event, the exponential spread of COVID-19 took governments around the world by surprise. The initial excuse was that COVID-19 was an unexpected ‘black swan’, which it of course was not. Either the thinking as it relates to pandemic threats is in too linear terms, or the message from the experts was not sufficiently convincing to political decision-makers to spring into action. This begs the question—why do we either ignore such risks or fail to take decisive action in face of a large-scale disaster? The purpose of this chapter is to review and examine methods and approaches that could enable governments and organizations to integrate security and preparedness decision-making from monitoring and detection to action through improved sensemaking. In other words, it seeks a path to being less taken surprise by the perils of deep uncertainty and taking the appropriate actions in a timely and sufficient manner. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Fjäder, C.",Advanced Sciences and Technologies for Security Applications,411,26

We aimed to characterize recent COVID-19-related community practice noninvasive diagnostic imaging professional work declines. METHODS: Using imaging metadata from nine community radiology practices across the United States between January 2019 and May 2020, we mapped work relative value unit (wRVU)-weighted stand-alone noninvasive diagnostic imaging service codes to both modality and body region. Weekly 2020 versus 2019 wRVU changes were analyzed by modality, body region, and site of service. Practice share &#967;2 testing was performed. RESULTS: Aggregate weekly wRVUs ranged from a high of 120,450 (February 2020) to a low of 55,188 (April 2020). During that -52% wRVU nadir, outpatient declines were greatest (-66%). All practices followed similar aggregate trends in the distribution of wRVUs between each 2020 versus 2019 week (P = .96-.98). As a percentage of total all-practice wRVUs, declines in CT (20,046 of 63,992; 31%) and radiography and fluoroscopy (19,196; 30%) were greatest. By body region, declines in abdomen and pelvis (16,203; 25%) and breast (12,032; 19%) imaging were greatest. Mammography (-17%) and abdominal and pelvic CT (-14%) accounted for the largest shares of total all-practice wRVU reductions. Across modality-region groups, declines were far greatest for mammography (-92%). CONCLUSIONS: Substantial COVID-19-related diagnostic imaging work declines were similar across community practices and disproportionately impacted mammography. Decline patterns could facilitate pandemic second wave planning. Overall implications for practice workflows, practice finances, patient access, and payment policy are manifold.","Duszak, Richard; Maze, Jeff; Sessa, Candice; Fleishon, Howard B; Golding, Lauren P; Nicola, Gregory N; Hughes, Danny R",J Am Coll Radiol,411,13

In addition, the reason behind the impaired chemesthetic sensations in some coronavirus patients remains unknown. In the present paper it is proposed that SARS-CoV-2 patients suffer from depletion of tryptophan, as ACE2, a key element in the process of absorption of tryptophan from the food, is significantly reduced in the patients as coronavirus uses ACE2 as the receptor to enter the host cells. The tryptophan depletion leads to a deficit of serotonin (5-HT) in SARS-COV-2 patients because tryptophan is the precursor in the synthesis of 5-HT. Such 5-HT deficiency can explain anosmia, ageusia and dysfunctional chemesthesis in COVID-19, given the fact that 5-HT is an important neuromodulator in the olfactory neurons, taste receptor cells and transient receptor potential channels (TRP channels) involved in chemesthesis. In addition, 5-HT deficiency worsens silent hypoxemia and depresses hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction leading to increased severity of the disease. Also, the levels of anti-inflammatory melatonin (synthesized from 5-HT) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+, produced from niacin whose precursor is the tryptophan) might decrease in coronavirus patients resulting in the aggravation of the disease. Interestingly, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may not be of much help in correcting the 5-HT deficiency in COVID-19 patients, as their efficacy goes down significantly when there is depletion of tryptophan in the system. Hence, tryptophan supplementation may herald a radical change in the treatment of COVID-19 and accordingly, clinical trials (therapeutic / prophylactic) should be conducted on coronavirus patients to find out how tryptophan supplementation (oral or parenteral, the latter in severe cases where there is hardly any absorption of tryptophan from the food) helps in curing, relieving or preventing the olfactory, gustatory and chemesthetic dysfunctions and in lessening the severity of the disease.","Sen, Amarnath",Med Hypotheses,411,1

In this review we outline the pathophysiology that underpins the potential use of anti-rheumatic therapies for severe COVID-19 infection and summarize the current evidence regarding the risk and outcome of COVID-19 in patients with systemic autoimmune diseases. Thus far there is no convincing evidence that any disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (conventional synthetic, biologic or targeted synthetic) including hydroxychloroquine, may protect against severe COVID-19 infection; answers about their possible usefulness in the management of the cytokine storm associated with severe COVID-9 infection will only arise from ongoing randomized controlled trials. Evidence on COVID-19 risk and outcome in patients with systemic autoimmune diseases is extremely limited; thus, any conclusions would be unsafe and should be seen with great caution. At present, the risk and severity (hospitalization, intensive care unit admission and death) of COVID-19 infection in people with autoimmune diseases do not appear particularly dissimilar to the general population, with the possible exception of hospitalization in patients exposed to high glucocorticoid doses. At this stage it is impossible to draw any conclusions for differences in COVID-19 risk and outcome between different autoimmune diseases and between the various immunomodulatory therapies used for them. More research in the field is obviously required, including as a minimum careful and systematic epidemiology and appropriately controlled clinical trials.","Kastritis, Efstathios; Kitas, George D; Vassilopoulos, Dimitrios; Giannopoulos, Georgios; Dimopoulos, Meletios A; Sfikakis, Petros P",Rheumatol Int,411,21

We aimed to provide potential laboratory basis for auxiliary distinguishing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) by monitoring above indicators. METHODS: A total of 84 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in the study. Baseline characteristics and laboratory results were collected and analyzed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to combined detection of SAA and IL-6 in patients with COVID-19, and independent risk factors for severity of COVID-19 were assessed by using binary logistic regression. RESULTS: The main clinical symptoms of patients with COVID-19 were fever (98.8%), fatigue (61.9%), and dry cough (58.3%). SAA, IL-6, and NLR were significantly higher in patients with COVID-19 (all P < .001), and compared with nonsevere patients, three indicators of severe patients were significantly elevated. Besides, combined detection of SAA and IL-6 better separates healthy people from patients with COVID-19 than detection of SAA or IL-6 alone. In addition, elevated SAA, IL-6, and NLR can be used as independent variables for predicting the severity of patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Serum amyloid A and IL-6 could be used as addition parameters to helping the distinguish of patients with COVID-19 from healthy people, and can provide potential basis for separating patients with nonsevere and severe clinical signs.","Liu, Qian; Dai, Yaping; Feng, Meimei; Wang, Xu; Liang, Wei; Yang, Fumeng",J Clin Lab Anal,411,20

This study aims to explore the epidemiological behaviour of two notifiable STDs during the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Cuba. Study design: This is an exploratory study of the incidence rates of syphilis and gonorrhoea during the COVID-19 pandemic in Cuba. Methods: This study compares national weekly surveillance data on syphilis and gonorrhoea incidence rates in Cuba with the timeline of implemented social confinement measures. Results: Incidence rates for both STDs were declining before the first case of COVID-19 was identified in Cuba. Following the confirmation of COVID-19 in Cuba and the implementation of social confinement measures, the decreasing incidence rates of syphilis and gonorrhoea continued. When social measures were subsequently relaxed, there was an increase in the incidence of syphilis, but incidence levels of gonorrhoea remained at a plateau. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that the social measures introduced to curb the spread of COVID-19 influenced the sexual risk behaviours of individuals and subsequently modified the incidence of syphilis and gonorrhoea. It is necessary to continue epidemiological surveillance for longer periods of time and to explore it at the local, regional and national levels to better understand STDs in times of COVID-19.","Rodríguez, Islay; Hernández, Yisel",Public Health Pract (Oxf),411,20

Climate science and biodiversity loss indicators, for example, illustrate the extent of environmental degradation and the concerns with the sustainability of Earth, or perhaps more specifically, the ability of Earth to sustain (human) life. There is also an increasing recognition of the environmental crisis as urgent, as an emergency, yet whether we are acting sufficiently to the environmental crisis is still up for debate. These debates have become more evident in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, creating a context within which to consider what it means to respond to a crisis and how the environment might feature in any post-COVID recovery. In this essay, we first outline and reflect on crisis, urgency and (in)action through a consideration of the environmental crisis and the COVID-19 crisis before moving to our main focus – the implications for environmental accounting. Specifically, we suggest that the construction of environmental accounting as accounting for the long-term, an attempt to contrast it with and overcome the problems with short-term conventional accounting, potentially contributes to the construction of the environment as lacking urgency and potentially enables its marginalisation. We argue that in order to make the most of accounting’s potential as a constitutive force, capable of participating in transforming preferences, decisions and behaviour in organisations and societies, environmental accounting needs to be about the short-term. We contribute to the ongoing discussions on how accounting needs to change if it is to recognise the urgent nature of the environmental crisis.","Tregidga, Helen Laine Matias",Critical Perspectives on Accounting,411,8

In this study, we examined the blocking activity of human COVID-19 convalescent plasma by cell-cell fusion assays using SARS-CoV-2-S-transfected 293 T as effector cells and ACE2-expressing 293 T as target cells. We demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 S protein exhibits a very high capacity for membrane fusion and is efficient in mediating virus fusion and entry into target cells. Importantly, we find that COVID-19 convalescent plasma with high titers of IgG neutralizing antibodies can block cell-cell fusion and virus entry by interfering with the SARS-CoV-2-S/ACE2 or SARS-CoV-S/ACE2 interactions. These findings suggest that COVID-19 convalescent plasma may not only inhibit SARS-CoV-2-S but also cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-S-mediated membrane fusion and virus entry, supporting its potential as a preventive and/or therapeutic agent against SARS-CoV-2 as well as other SARS-CoV infections.","Wang, Ling; Zhao, Juan; Nguyen, Lam N T; Adkins, James L; Schank, Madison; Khanal, Sushant; Nguyen, Lam N; Dang, Xindi; Cao, Dechao; Thakuri, Bal Krishna Chand; Lu, Zeyuan; Zhang, Jinyu; Zhang, Yi; Wu, Xiao Y; El Gazzar, Mohamed; Ning, Shunbin; Moorman, Jonathan P; Yao, Zhi Q",Sci Rep,411,16

However, the percentage of outpatient urological cases that could be managed completely by telemedicine outside of the COVID-19 pandemic remains to be determined. We conducted a prospective, multisite study involving all urologists working in the region of Quebec City. METHODS: During the first four weeks of the regional confinement, 18 pediatric and adult urologists were asked to determine, after each telemedicine appointment, if it translated into a complete (CCM), incomplete (ICM), or suboptimal case management (SCM, adequate only in the context of the pandemic). RESULTS: A total of 1679 appointments representing all urological areas were registered. Overall, 67.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 65.3; 69.8), 27.1% (25.0; 29.3), and 4.3% (3.5; 5.4) were reported as CCM, SCM, and ICM, respectively. The CCM ratio varied according to the reason for consultation, with cancer suspicion (52.9% [42.9; 62.8]) and pediatric reasons (38.0% [30.0; 46.6]) showing the lowest CCM percentages. CCM percentages also varied significantly based on the setting where it was performed, ranging from 61.1% (private clinic) to 86.8% (endourology and general hospital). CONCLUSIONS: We show that two-thirds of all urological outpatient cases could be completely managed by telemedicine outside of the pandemic. After the pandemic, it will be important to incorporate telemedicine as an alternative for a patient's first or followup visit, especially those with geographical, pathological, and socioeconomic considerations.","Turcotte, Bruno; Paquet, Sophie; Blais, Anne-Sophie; Blouin, Annie-Claude; Bolduc, Stéphane; Bureau, Michel; Caumartin, Yves; Cloutier, Jonathan; Deschênes-Rompré, Marie-Pier; Dujardin, Thierry; Fradet, Yves; Lacombe, Louis; Moore, Katherine; Morin, Fannie; Nadeau, Geneviève; Simonyan, David; Soucy, Frédéric; Tiguert, Rabi; Toren, Paul; Lodde, Michele; Pouliot, Frédéric",Can Urol Assoc J,411,22

Although studies conducted prior to the pandemic have suggested that telemedicine is an acceptable format for older adults, there is a paucity of data on the practical implementation of telemedicine visits. Due to prior lack of reimbursement for telemedicine visits involving nonrural patients, no studies have compared telephone visits to video visits in geriatric primary care. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine (1) whether video visits had longer durations, more visit diagnoses, and more advance care planning discussions than telephone visits during the rapid implementation of telemedicine in the COVID-19 pandemic, and (2) whether disparities in visit type existed based on patient characteristics. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of patients seen at two geriatric clinics from April 23 to May 22, 2020. Approximately 25% of patients who had telephone and video appointments during this time underwent chart review. We analyzed patient characteristics, visit characteristics, duration of visits, number of visit diagnoses, and the presence of advance care planning discussion in clinical documentation. RESULTS: Of the 190 appointments reviewed, 47.4% (n=90) were video visits. Compared to telephone appointments, videoconferencing was, on average, 7 minutes longer (mean 37.3 minutes, SD 10 minutes; P<.001) and had, on average, 1.2 more visit diagnoses (mean 5.7, SD 3; P=.001). Video and telephone visits had similar rates of advance care planning. Furthermore, hearing, vision, and cognitive impairment did not result in different rates of video or telephone appointments. Non-White patients, patients who needed interpreter services, and patients who received Medicaid were less likely to have video visits than White patients, patients who did not need an interpreter, and patients who did not receive Medicaid, respectively (P=.003, P=.01, P<.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Although clinicians spent more time on video visits than telephone visits, more than half of this study's older patients did not use video visits, especially if they were from racial or ethnic minority backgrounds or Medicaid beneficiaries. This potential health care disparity merits greater attention.","Schifeling, Christopher H; Shanbhag, Prajakta; Johnson, Angene; Atwater, Riannon C; Koljack, Claire; Parnes, Bennett L; Vejar, Maria M; Farro, Samantha A; Phimphasone-Brady, Phoutdavone; Lum, Hillary D",JMIR Aging,411,1

Authorities have deployed several surveillance tools to detect and slow down the rapid misinformation spread online. Large quantities of unverified information are available online and at present there is no real-time tool available to alert a user about false information during online health inquiries over a web search engine. To bridge this gap, we propose a web search engine misinformation notifier extension (SEMiNExt). Natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithm have been successfully integrated into the extension. This enables SEMiNExt to read the user query from the search bar, classify the veracity of the query and notify the authenticity of the query to the user, all in real-time to prevent the spread of misinformation. Our results show that SEMiNExt under artificial neural network (ANN) works best with an accuracy of 93%, F1-score of 92%, precision of 92% and a recall of 93% when 80% of the data is trained. Moreover, ANN is able to predict with a very high accuracy even for a small training data size. This is very important for an early detection of new misinformation from a small data sample available online that can significantly reduce the spread of misinformation and maximize public health safety. The SEMiNExt approach has introduced the possibility to improve online health management system by showing misinformation notifications in real-time, enabling safer web-based searching on health-related issues.","Shams, Abdullah Bin; Hoque Apu, Ehsanul; Rahman, Ashiqur; Sarker Raihan, Md Mohsin; Siddika, Nazeeba; Preo, Rahat Bin; Hussein, Molla Rashied; Mostari, Shabnam; Kabir, Russell",,411,30

The brief Arab religious coping scale, the Arabic version of the spiritual well-being Scale, and the Arabic Scale of death anxiety were used to measure religious coping, spiritual well-being, and death anxiety, respectively. The majority of the participating older adults were found to have low levels of religious coping and spiritual well-being and high levels of death anxiety. Further, in comparison to male older adults, female older adults were found to have higher levels of religious coping and lower levels of death anxiety. Moreover, in comparison to widowed older adults, married older adults were found to have higher levels of death anxiety. After controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, religious coping, and spiritual well-being were found to be significant predictors of death anxiety in older adults.","Rababa, Mohammad; Hayajneh, Audai A; Bani-Iss, Wegdan",,411,16

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a deep impact on periodic outpatient evaluations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of low brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) values in predicting adverse events in heart failure (HF) patients in order to evaluate implications for safe delay of outpatient visits. Methods. This was a retrospective study. One-thousand patients (mean age: 72 ± 10 years, 561 women) with HF and BNP values &lt;250 pg/mL at discharge were included. A 6-month follow-up was performed. The primary endpoint was a combination of deaths and readmissions for HF within 6-month after discharge. Results. At 6-month follow-up, 104 events (10.4%) were recorded (65 HF readmissions and 39 all-cause deaths). Univariate Cox analysis identified as significant predictors of outcome were age (p &lt; 0.001, hazard ratio [HR] = 1.044), creatinine (p = 0.001, HR = 1.411), and BNP (p &lt; 0.001, HR = 1.010). Multivariate Cox regression confirmed that BNP (p &lt; 0.001, HR = 1.009), creatinine (p = 0.016, HR = 1.247), and age (p = 0.013, HR = 1.027) were independent predictors of events in HF patients with BNP values &lt;250 pg/mL at discharge. Patients with BNP values &gt;100 pg/mL and creatinine &gt;1.0 mg/dL showed increased events rates (from 4.3% to 19.0%) as compared to those with lower values (p &lt; 0.000, HR = 4.014). Conclusions.

In a partial 'lock-down' during the COVID-19 pandemic period, we performed a web-based, cross-sectional study. We compared 80 self-selected subjects (51 vegans, 67% females, and 29 non-vegans, 55% females, p = 0.344). Nutritional status was assessed by bio-electrical impedance and standardized food frequency questionnaires (i.e., contribution of nutrients from foods and supplementation, combined and separate). Serum lipid concentrations and blood pressure (BP) were assessed from annual or initial examination reports, while sociodemographic, economic, and lifestyle statuses were obtained by standardized questionnaires. Finally, a multivariate linear regression model was used to estimate the relationship between total fiber and saturated fatty acid (SFA) intake and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL cholesterol) values. The vegans had a significantly lower body mass index (22.8 ± 2.4 vs. 26.6 ± 3.6 kg/m2, p < 0.001) and body fat % (19.3 ± 7.3 vs. 25.8 ± 8.2%, p < 0.001) than the non-vegans. There were significant differences between vegans and non-vegans in energy intake, and most macronutrient (10/12) and micronutrient (15/23) intakes in units/day. Both diets were well designed, with high fiber and low SFA and free sugar intake but remained insufficient in n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (for vegans), vitamin D, calcium, sodium (for vegans) and iodine. Vegans also had a significantly lower lipid profile and BP than non-vegans, except for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. However, both groups met targeted recommendations. Furthermore, fiber and SFA intake and age explained 47% of the variance in LDL cholesterol. In conclusion, 'health conscious' vegans and non-vegans with comparable lifestyle statuses had significant differences in dietary intake, body composition and cardiovascular health status.","Jakse, Bostjan; Jakse, Barbara; Godnov, Uros; Pinter, Stanislav",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),411,24

Italy was one of the first Western countries who faced the health emergency and is one of the countries most severely affected by the pandemic. The diffusion of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Italy has followed a peculiar spatial pattern, however the attention of the scientific community has so far focussed almost exclusively on the prediction of the evolution of the disease over time. METHODS: Official freely available data about the number of infected at the finest possible level of spatial areal aggregation (Italian provinces) are used to model the spatio-temporal distribution of COVID-19 infections at local level. An endemic-epidemic time-series mixed-effects generalized linear model for areal disease counts has been implemented to understand and predict spatio-temporal diffusion of the phenomenon. RESULTS: Three subcomponents characterize the fitted model. The first describes the transmission of the illness within provinces; the second accounts for the transmission between nearby provinces; the third is related to the evolution of the disease over time. At the local level, the provinces first concerned by containment measures are those that are not affected by the effects of spatial neighbours. On the other hand, the component accounting for the spatial interaction with surrounding areas is prevalent for provinces that are strongly involved by contagions. Moreover, the proposed model provides good forecasts for the number of infections at local level while controlling for delayed reporting. CONCLUSIONS: A strong evidence is found that strict control measures implemented in some provinces efficiently break contagions and limit the spread to nearby areas. While containment policies may potentially be more effective if planned considering the peculiarities of local territories, the effective and homogeneous enforcement of control measures at national level is needed to prevent the disease control being delayed or missed as a whole. This may also apply at international level where, as it is for the European Union or the United States, the internal border checks among states have largely been abolished.","Giuliani, Diego; Dickson, Maria Michela; Espa, Giuseppe; Santi, Flavio",BMC Infect Dis,411,24

In an effort to understand the biophysical changes as a result of mutations, the mechanics of multiple different proteins within the SARS-CoV-2 virus have been studied and compared with SARS-CoV-1. Focusing on the main protease (mPro), we first explored the long range dynamic-relationship, particularly in cross-chain dynamics, using the Dynamic Coupling Index (DCI) to investigate the dynamic coupling between the catalytic site residues and the rest of the protein, both inter and intra chain for the CoV-1 and CoV-2 mPro. We found that there is significant cross-chain coupling between these active sites and distal residues in the CoV-2 mPro but it was missing in CoV-1. The enhanced long distance interactions, particularly between the two chains, suggest subsequently enhanced cooperativity for CoV-2. A further comparative analysis of the dynamic flexibility using the Dynamic Flexibility Index (DFI) between the CoV-1 and CoV-2 mPros shows that the inhibitor binding near active sites induces change in flexibility to a distal region of the protein, opposite in behavior between the two systems; this region becomes more flexible upon inhibitor binding in CoV-1 while it becomes less flexible in the CoV-2 mPro. Upon inspection, we show that, on average, the dynamic flexibility of the sites substituted from CoV-1 to CoV-2 changes significantly less than the average calculated across all residues within the structure, indicating that the differences in behaviors between the two systems is likely the result of allosteric influence, where the new substitutions in COV-2 induce flexibility and dynamical changes elsewhere in the structure. SIGNIFICANCEHere we have conducted a comparative analysis between the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 mPro systems to shed mechanistic insight on the biophysical changes associated with the mutations between these two enzymes. Our work shows that the CoV-2 mPro system exhibits enhanced cross-chain communication between catalytic site residues and the rest of the structure. Further, both dynamic coupling and dynamic flexibility analyses indicates that, largely, the dynamic changes as evaluated by DCI and DFI occur at sites other than the mutation sites themselves, indicating that the functional differences between these two proteins are a result of dynamic allostery","Campitelli, Paul; Lu, Jin; Ozkan, Sefika Banu",,411,24

The most recent occurrence originated in the city of Wuhan, China where a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged causing severe respiratory illness and pneumonia. The continual emergence of novel coronaviruses underscores the importance of developing effective vaccines as well as novel therapeutic options that target either viral functions or host factors recruited to support coronavirus replication. The CoV nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) has been shown to promote cellular mRNA degradation, block host cell translation, and inhibit the innate immune response to virus infection. Interestingly, deletion of the nsp1-coding region in infectious clones prevented the virus from productively infecting cultured cells. Because of nsp1's importance in the CoV life cycle, it has been highlighted as a viable target for both antiviral therapy and vaccine development. However, the fundamental molecular and structural mechanisms that underlie nsp1 function remain poorly understood, despite its critical role in the viral life cycle. Here we report the high-resolution crystal structure of the amino, globular portion of SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 (residues 10 - 127) at 1.77 Å resolution. A comparison of our structure with the SARS-CoV-1 nsp1 structure reveals how mutations alter the conformation of flexible loops, inducing the formation of novel secondary structural elements and new surface features. Paired with the recently published structure of the carboxyl end of nsp1 (residues 148 - 180), our results provide the groundwork for future studies focusing on SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 structure and function during the viral life cycle.IMPORTANCE The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent for the COVID-19 pandemic. One protein known to play a critical role in the coronavirus life cycle is nonstructural protein1 (nsp1). As such, it has been highlighted in numerous studies as a target for both the development of antivirals and for the design of live-attenuated vaccines. Here we report the high-resolution crystal structure of nsp1 derived from SARS-CoV-2 at 1.77 Å resolution. This structure will facilitate future studies focusing on understanding the relationship between structure and function for nsp1. In turn, understanding these structure-function relationships will allow nsp1 to be fully exploited as a target for both antiviral development and vaccine design.","Clark, Lauren K; Green, Todd J; Petit, Chad M",J. virol,411,26

A previous diagnosis of chronic liver disease is associated with poorer outcomes. Nevertheless, the impact of silent liver injury has not been investigated. We aimed to explore the association of pre-admission liver fibrosis indices with the prognosis of critically ill COVID-19 patients. Methods: The work presented was an observational study in 214 patients with COVID-19 consecutively admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Pre-admission liver fibrosis indices were calculated. In-hospital mortality and predictive factors were explored with Kaplan–Meier and Cox regression analysis. Results: The mean age was 59.58 (13.79) years;16 patients (7.48%) had previously recognised chronic liver disease. Up to 78.84% of patients according to Forns, and 45.76% according to FIB-4, had more than minimal fibrosis. Fibrosis indices were higher in non-survivors [Forns: 6.04 (1.42) versus 4.99 (1.58), p &lt; 0.001;FIB-4: 1.77 (1.17) versus 1.41 (0.91), p = 0.020)], but no differences were found in liver biochemistry parameters. Patients with any degree of fibrosis either by Forns or FIB-4 had a higher mortality, which increased according to the severity of fibrosis (p &lt; 0.05 for both indexes). Both Forns [HR 1.41 (1.11–1.81);p = 0.006] and FIB-4 [HR 1.31 (0.99–1.72);p = 0.051] were independently related to survival after adjusting for the Charlson comorbidity index, APACHE II, and ferritin. Conclusion: Unrecognised liver fibrosis, assessed by serological tests prior to admission, is independently associated with a higher risk of death in patients with severe COVID-19 admitted to the ICU.","Romero-Cristóbal, M.; Clemente-Sánchez, A.; Piñeiro, P.; Cedeño, J.; Rayón, L.; del Río, J.; Ramos, C.; Hernández, D.

Dentro del espectro de los medicamentos catalogados como interferón (IFN) tenemos IFN alfa o IFN alfa pegilado, IFN alfa 2a, IFN alfa 2b, IFN beta, IFN beta 1a, IFN beta 1b, e IFN gamma (Friedman 2008) De manera anecdótica, ante los brotes de MERS y SARS producidos en años previos, se investigó el uso de IFN como medida terapéutica (Sainz et al 2004;Scagnolari et al 2004) Sin embargo, dichos estudios corresponden a estudios in-vitro En el estudio in vitro de Sainz y col 2004 (Sainz et al 2004), se encontró que sinérgicamente IFN beta e IFN gamma inhiben el crecimiento de los cultivos en placa del SARS-CoV, virus que causó el brote del 2003 en China;en el estudio in vitro de Scagnolari y col 2005 (Scagnolari et al 2004), se encontró que los IFN presentaban capacidad para inhibir el crecimiento en placa del SARS-CoV (principalmente de IFN beta e IFN gamma) Por otra parte, en una revisión sistemáticade Morra y col 2018 (Morra et al 2018), donde se estudió el uso de IFN para el tratamiento de MERS-CoV, responsable del brote en Arabia Saudita en el 2012, en sus diferentes presentaciones (incluyendo IFN alfa-2a, IFN alfa-2b, e IFN beta-1a) en combinación con ribavirina, se encontró que no hubo diferencias significativas en desenlaces clínicos cuando se le comparó con otra terapia de soporte Se observó que se suele utilizar IFN (IFN alfa-2a, IFN alfa-2b, e IFN beta1a) en combinación con ribavirina En otro estudio tipo revisión sistemática de Momattin y col 2019 (Momattin, Al-Ali, and Al-Tawfiq 2019), encontraron que no existe consenso para el tratamiento de MERS-CoV pues los estudios fueron heterogéneos y los resultados no concluyentes En dicho estudio se utilizó IFN 1b en combinación con ribavirina Debemos resaltar que existe una escasez de evidencia respecto al uso de interferón en COVID19, y la mayoría de la evidencia proviene de estudios in-vitro GUÍAS DE PRÁCTICA CLÍNICA: La Guía de Medicina Integrativa de China Oriental para el manejo del nuevo coronavirus 2019, provee de información clínica y epidemiológica sobre el COVID 19 Dentro de las alternativas terapéuticas que se encuentran en investigación, menciona al interferón y la evidencia que proviene de estudios de ciencias básicas que encontraron que este medicamento puede frenar la replicación in-vitro del SARS-CoV (Sainz y col 2004) (Scagnolari y col 2005) El estudio de Sainz y col del 2014 encontró que sinérgicamente IFN beta e IFN gamma inhiben el crecimiento de los cultivos en placa del SARS-CoV El estudio de Scagnolari y col del 2005, encontró que los IFN presentaban capacidad para inhibir el crecimiento en placa del SARS-CoV (principalmente de IFN beta e IFN gamma) La GPC no presenta recomendaciones respecto al uso de IFN (en ninguna presentación), solo indica que se encuentra en etapa experimental para el uso de pacientes con COVID-19 ESTUDIO SERIE DE CASOS: Lo que se presenta aqui es la experiencia de manejo de pacientes, quienes recibieron múltiples esquemas de tratamiento incluido el IFN Por tanto, no podemos concluir que los resultados encontrados se deben al uso de IFN Además, la metodología de una serie de casos no es la ideal para establecer que los pacientes mejoraron por el uso de IFN Es necesario realizar ensayos clínicos para determinar como influye el IFN en el manejo clínico de pacientes con COVID19 ENSAYOS CLÍNICOS EN CURSO O NO PUBLICADOS

de estudio: 31 de julio del 2022 EXPERIENCIA RECOGIDA DE HOSPITALES EN EL MUNDO: Debido a que la enfermedad por COVID19 inició en diciembre del 2019, algunos hospitales han recomendado el uso de IFN bajo las siguientes modalidades: España (Sociedad Española de Farmacia Hospitalaria al 18 de marzo 2020): (Sociedad Española de Farmacia Hospitalaria 2020) Se utiliza hasta que caiga la fiebre y no más de 14 días: Estados Unidos (Guía de manejo de COVID19 del Massachusetts Medical Hospital al 17 de marzo 2020): (Massachusetts General Hospital 2020) CONCLUSIONES: A la fecha, 24 de marzo del 2020, aun no se encuentran ensayos clínicos publicados con resultados de eficacia y seguridad respecto al uso del IFN en pacientes con COVID19, infectadas con el virus SARS-CoV-2 Como hecho anecdótico se toma la experiencia de uso de IFN en infecciones causadas por los virus SARS-CoV y MERS-CoV en años previos, los cuales comparten parte importante de su componente genético con el SARS-CoV-2 Encontramos resultados en estudios in-vitro donde el IFN mostró cierta capacidad de inhibir el crecimiento de los virus mencionados Las recomendaciones de la GPC de Chan y col (2020), se basa en estudios invitro realizados en el 2004 (Sainz et al 2004;Scagnolari et al 2004) La guía de Chan y col (2020) indica que el uso de IFN en cualquiera de sus presentaciones no se encuentra recomendado para pacientes con infección por COVID-19 y su uso solo es experimental Por otro lado, la GPC de National Health Commission &amp;Stare Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine recomienda incluir el uso de IFN-alfa pero no menciona la Encontramos una serie de casos en China (Wan et al 2020) con 135 pacientes con COVID19 a quienes se le administró IFN más lopinavir/ritonavir, en combinación con antibióticos y corticoides Alrededor del mes de seguimiento, 11 1% (n=15) de pacientes fueron dados de alta, la tasa de mortalidad a los 28 días de seguimiento fue de 2 5% Este estudio constituye un primer aporte a la literatura científica sobre el manejo de pacientes con COVID19 Debido a que todos los pacientes del estudio recibieron IFN en combinación con lopinavir/ritonavir, no se puede discriminar si el efecto del IFN es favorable o no para pacientes con COVID19 Es necesario realizar ensayos clínicos para determinar cómo influye el IFN en el manejo clínico de pacientes con COVID19 fuente de donde se obtiene la evidencia para recomendar el uso de IFN Encontramos que se están llevando a cabo varios ensayos clínicos (EC) respecto al uso de IFN para pacientes con COVID19 Los ensayos clínicos más próximos para finalizar son en julio del 2020 La intervención de interés en la experiencia en hospitales (Sociedad Española de Farmacia Hospitalaria 2020) (Massachusetts General Hospital 2020), por lo general, es dual Es decir, combina la acción de un tipo de IFN junto a otro antiviral, que por lo general es ribavirina Otros tipos de antivirales con los cuales se combina al IFN son los esteroides, lopinavir/ritonavir, o micofenolato mofetil Encontramos guías de sociedades/hospitales internacionales donde actualmente tienen picos muy altos de pacientes con COVID19 Dichas guías incluyen en su algoritmo terapéutico al IFN en diferentes formas (IFN alfa-2b nebulizada e IFN beta-1b inyectable) Sin embargo, no existe ningún ensayo clínico a la fecha que respalde su uso, salvo la experiencia de manejo de pacientes en China Por ello, son necesarios los resultados de los ensayos clínicos en curso Por lo expuesto, al momento, no se encuentra que IFN en ninguna de sus presentaciones (IFN alfa o IFN alfa pegilado, IFN alfa 2a, IFN alfa 2b, IFN beta, IFN beta 1a, IFN beta 1b, o IFN gamma), tenga evidencia clínica que respalde una recomendación a favor como una alternativa de tratamiento para pacientes con COVID19 Se necesita de los resultados de los EC que se están realizando para conocer tanto su eficacia como su seguridad en pacientes con COVID19","Peru.

Subject and methods: In the period March 20-30, 2020, we collected data on COVID-19-related knowledge, awareness and adoption of preventive practices, depression and anxiety (Patient Health Questionnaire-4), stress (Impact of Event Scale-6), pessimism, and tobacco and alcohol use. Differences between age groups (18-39 years, 40-59 years and &#8805; 60 years) were tested using Pearson's chi-squared tests or ANOVAs; associations between drinking and smoking and depression, anxiety, and stress were tested using adjusted logistic regression models. Results: Approximately half of the sample (N Total = 6391) were 50-69 years old and 58% were female. COVID-19 knowledge (mean = 12.0; SD = 1.2) and protective practice awareness (mean = 9.1; SD = 0.8) were high. Among respondents, 44% had a score consistent with depression and anxiety (PHQ-4 score &#8805; 6), and 52% reported high stress scores (&#8805; median of 1.33). COVID-19-related anxiety and depression were associated with increased drinking (AOR = 1.79; 95% CI = 1.49, 2.15) and smoking (AOR = 2.17; 95% CI = 1.64, 2.88). High stress scores were also associated with increased drinking (AOR = 1.80; 95% CI = 1.49, 2.17, p < 0.001) and smoking (AOR = 1.75; 95% CI = 1.31, 2.33). Conclusions: In spite of high knowledge levels, important gaps were identified. High prevalence of poor mental health outcomes and associated increases in drinking and smoking warrant ongoing risk communications tailoring to effectively disseminate information and expanding psychosocial services, particularly via telehealth, to mitigate the negative mental health impact of COVID-19.

The purpose of this study was to identify factors that early predict the progression of COVID-19 from severe to critical illness. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included adult patients with severe or critical ill COVID-19 who were consecutively admitted to the Zhongfaxincheng campus of Tongji Hospital (Wuhan, China) from February 8 to 18, 2020. Baseline variables, data at hospital admission and during hospital stay, as well as clinical outcomes were collected from electronic medical records system. The primary endpoint was the development of critical illness. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify independent factors that were associated with the progression from severe to critical illness. RESULTS: A total of 138 patients were included in the analysis; of them 119 were diagnosed as severe cases and 16 as critical ill cases at hospital admission. During hospital stay, 19 more severe cases progressed to critical illness. For all enrolled patients, longer duration from diagnosis to admission (odds ratio [OR] 1.108, 95% CI 1.022-1.202; P = 0.013), pulse oxygen saturation at admission <93% (OR 5.775, 95% CI 1.257-26.535; P = 0.024), higher neutrophil count (OR 1.495, 95% CI 1.177-1.899; P = 0.001) and higher creatine kinase-MB level at admission (OR 2.449, 95% CI 1.089-5.511; P = 0.030) were associated with a higher risk, whereas higher lymphocyte count at admission (OR 0.149, 95% CI 0.026-0.852; P = 0.032) was associated with a lower risk of critical illness development. For the subgroup of severe cases at hospital admission, the above factors except creatine kinase-MB level were also found to have similar correlation with critical illness development. CONCLUSIONS: Higher neutrophil count and lower lymphocyte count at admission were early independent predictors of progression to critical illness in severe COVID-19 patients.","Li, Nan; Kong, Hao; Zheng, Xi-Zi; Li, Xue-Ying; Ma, Jing; Zhang, Hong; Wang, Dong-Xin; Li, Hai-Chao; Liu, Xin-Min",PLoS One,411,24

In this context, longitudinal data on proportions of positive results in different age groups are rare. Data on total positive counts and on shares of positive counts deriving from a private (MVZ) and a University (RWTH) laboratory were analyzed retrospectively and compared with public data on total positive counts of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). Data were covered for Weeks 9-24 of the year 2020 and all patient ages. Total positive counts were lower in children compared to adults. Proportions of children and adults tested positive were 3%-5% and 5%-7%, respectively. RKI and MVZ data showed similar time-related patterns. Patients of 20-60 years of age did account for the initial virus spread (maximum infection rates at Weeks 9-11). Thereafter, infection rates decreased in older patients whereas children did not show a comparable time-related decrease. Pediatric data generated in outpatient settings and hospitals differed markedly which should be considered in further studies. In summary, compared with adults children are less affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections and are unlikely to account for the initial viral spread.

The statistical properties of the models, in particular the correlation functions and the probability density function, have duly been computed. Our models, which generalises a model previously proposed and published in a specialised journal, take into account the adoption of the lockdown measures as well as the crucial role of the hospitals and Health Care Institutes. To accomplish this work we have analysed two scenarios: the SIS-model (Susceptible =>Infectious =>Susceptible) in presence of the lockdown measures and the SIS-model integrated with the action of the hospitals (always in presence of the lockdown measures). We show that in the case of the pure SIS-model, once the lockdown measures are removed, the Coronavirus will start growing again. However, in the second scenario, beyond a certain threshold of the hospital capacities, the Coronavirus is not only kept under control, but its capacity to spread tends to diminish in time. Therefore, the combined effect of the lockdown measures with the action of the hospitals and health Institutes is able to contain and dampen the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. This result can be used during a period of time when the massive distribution of delivery of a limited number of vaccines in a given population is not yet feasible. By way of example, we analysed the data for USA and France where the intensities of the noise have been estimated by Statistical Mechanics. In particular, for USA we have analysed two possible hypotheses: USA is still subject to the first wave of infection by and USA is in the second (or third) wave of SARS-CoV-2 infection.The agreement between theoretical predictions and real data confirms the validity of our approach.","Sonnino, Giorgio; Mora, Fernando; Nardone, Pasquale",,411,22

We assessed these risks in patients with MS (PwMS). OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to describe the overall risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, severe disease course, and potential population-level predictors of COVID-19 infection in PwMS, and to provide a context using a cohort of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In addition, the association of different MS DMTs with the incidence and clinical course of COVID-19 was evaluated. Safety data from the Biogen Global Safety Database are also presented on reported cases of COVID-19 in patients treated with Biogen MS therapies. METHODS: The IBM® Explorys electronic health record database of > 72,000,000 patients from US healthcare networks identified patients with MS or SLE, with and without polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19. COVID-19 cumulative incidence, hospitalization, and deaths among DMT classes were compared using logistic regression (adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, comorbidities, and race/ethnicity). As a secondary data source to assess safety data, COVID-19 reports for Biogen MS therapies were extracted and described from Biogen's Global Safety Database. RESULTS: 30,478 PwMS with an open DMT prescription were identified within Explorys; 344 were COVID-19 positive. The most significant risk factors for acquiring COVID-19 were comorbidity score &#8805; 1, body mass index &#8805; 30, and Black/African ancestry. Similar risk factors were also identified for patients with SLE. Patients with MS were less likely to develop COVID-19 when treated with interferons (0.61%) and glatiramer acetate (0.51%), vs all other MS DMTs (both p < 0.001); anti-CD20 therapy was associated with the highest risk (3.45%; p < 0.0001). In the Biogen Global Safety Database, we identified 1217 patients who were COVID-19 positive treated with intramuscular interferon beta-1a, peginterferon beta-1a, natalizumab, dimethyl fumarate, diroximel fumarate, or fampridine. CONCLUSIONS: Comorbidities, obesity, and Black/African ancestry, but not age, were associated with a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in PwMS. Interferons and glatiramer acetate were associated with a reduced COVID-19 risk, whereas anti-CD20 therapies were associated with an increased risk, within the treated MS cohort. COVID-19 safety reports for patients receiving Biogen MS therapies were consistent with the Explorys database and MS literature, illustrating the replicability and power of this approach.","Reder, Anthony T; Centonze, Diego; Naylor, Maria L; Nagpal, Anjali; Rajbhandari, Rajani; Altincatal, Arman; Kim, Michelle; Berdofe, Aaron; Radhakrishnan, Maha; Jung, Eunice; Sandrock, Alfred W; Smirnakis, Karen; Popescu, Catrinel; de Moor, Carl",CNS Drugs,411,24

This study aimed to systematically review the available evidence in the literature for cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) in association with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases to identify cases of COVID-19-associated CVT. The search period spanned 1 January 2020 to 1 December 2020, and the review protocol (PROSPERO-CRD42020214327) followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Identified studies were evaluated for bias using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. A proportion meta-analysis was performed to estimate the frequency of CVT among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: We identified 57 cases from 28 reports. Study quality was mostly classified as low. CVT symptoms developed after respiratory disease in 90%, and the mean interval was 13 days. CVT involved multiple sites in 67% of individuals, the deep venous system was affected in 37%, and parenchymal hemorrhage was found in 42%. Predisposing factors for CVT beyond SARS-CoV-2 infection were present in 31%. In-hospital mortality was 40%. Using data from 34,331 patients, the estimated frequency of CVT among patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 infection was 0.08% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.01-0.5). In an inpatient setting, CVT accounted for 4.2% of cerebrovascular disorders in individuals with COVID-19 (cohort of 406 patients, 95% CI: 1.47-11.39). CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral venous thrombosis in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection is a rare, although there seems to be an increased relative risk. High suspicion is necessary, because the diagnosis of this potentially life-threatening condition in COVID-19 patients can be challenging. Evidence is still scarce on the pathophysiology and potential prevention of COVID-19-associated CVT.","Baldini, Tommaso; Asioli, Gian Maria; Romoli, Michele; Carvalho Dias, Mariana; Schulte, Eva C; Hauer, Larissa; Aguiar De Sousa, Diana; Sellner, Johann; Zini, Andrea",Eur. j. neurol,411,16

On the basis of postmodern education theories, this study adopted images and oral accounts involving personal experiences to construct a postmodern education research scheme by using the method of collaborative ethnography. This study selected and performed the following services: filming a community documentary, administering community health dance classes, and archiving community cultural artifacts in databases. Interviews were also administered to facilitate implementation of the actual services. Community health services commonly seen in Taiwan and abroad were compiled, and the resources required for each service were examined. Subsequently, factor analysis was performed to explore the characteristic of these services in order to recommend feasible services for university students to undertake. The results indicated that the eight resources required for the 59 common community health services were (1) a designated space or venue, (2) materials, (3) monetary resources, (4) human resources, (5) expertise, (6) professional equipment, (7) patience, and (8) empathy. The results revealed three principal components, namely labor services, high-resource services, and professional services, for a total explanatory power of 67.99%; the individual explanatory power of these components accounted for 25.04%, 21.81%, and 21.15%, respectively. Next, community health care services suitable for university students to perform were selected and implemented, and these services were well received. The study results indicated that community and environmental justice can be realized by identifying with the value of community health services and promoting postmodern education theories and social norms. The research results are suitable for implementation after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Shyu, Guey-Shin; Lin, Shinn-Jou; Fang, Wei-Ta; Cheng, Bai-You",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),411,16

This study compares retinal toxicity and ocular survival between two formulations, with and without propylene glycol (Alkeran vs. Evomela, respectively). METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of retinoblastoma patients who received intravitreal injections of Alkeran and Evomela at 30 µg from September 2012 to January 2019 at a single tertiary care center were enrolled. Retinal toxicity was measured using electroretinogram (ERG) and compared using a multivariate analysis of 338 injections in 101 eyes of 96 patients. Ocular survival of 163 eyes in 150 patients was compared across formulations using Cox proportional hazards model. Eyes were censored at the time a patient received a dose other than 30 µg. RESULTS: Overall, ERG decline (mean, 95% CI) for each injection was -5.58 µV (-7.17, -3.99). No significant differences in ERG decrement were found between Alkeran (with alcohol) -5.52uV (-6.99, -4.05). and Evomela (without alcohol) -5.65uV (-8.31 to -2.98) formulations (p = 0.93). Ocular survival at 24 months was 93.6% (95% CI 86.2, 97.1) with alcohol and 91.7% (95% CI 53.9, 98.8) without alcohol. The hazard ratio (HR) for without vs with alcohol was 0.50 (95% CI 0.06 to 4.07); no significant difference in ocular survival was found between formulations (p = 0.52). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: No differences were found in retinal toxicity and ocular survival between 30 µg intravitreal injections of Alkeran or Evomela for intraocular retinoblastoma. Given the increased stability of Evomela, intravitreal treatment could be expanded to centers without the ability to supply Alkeran due to its shorter safety window; however, Alkeran is less expensive. For those with existing infrastructure, Alkeran is a comparable, cost-effective alternative.","Hsieh, Terry; Liao, Albert; Francis, Jasmine H; Lavery, Jessica A; Mauguen, Audrey; Brodie, Scott E; Abramson, David H",PLoS One,411,16

The purpose of this study was to determine how SARS-CoV-2 infection impacts histone levels, fibrin structure, and endogenous thrombin potential in the presence and absence of endothelial cells. ApproachWe studied individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection and acute respiratory distress syndrome at the time of initiation of mechanical ventilation compared to healthy controls. Blood samples were assayed for levels of histone-DNA complexes. Confocal microscopy was used to evaluate fibrin structure in clots formed from recalcified plasma samples using fluorescently-labeled fibrinogen. Endogenous thrombin potential was measured by calibrated automated thrombin assays in the presence of tissue factor and phospholipid (PCPS) or cultured human endothelial cells. ResultsCirculating nucleosomes were elevated in the plasma of COVID-19 patients relative to healthy controls (n=6, each group). COVID-19 patient plasma thrombin generation was also altered. Despite having an increased endogenous thrombin potential, patient plasma samples exhibited prolonged lag times and times to peak thrombin in the presence of added tissue factor and PCPS. Strikingly different results were observed when endothelial cells were used in place of tissue factor and PCPS. Control plasma samples did not generate measurable thrombin (lag time >60 min); in contrast, plasma samples from COVID-19+ patients generated thrombin (mean lag time [~]20 min). Consistent with the observed alterations in thrombin generation, clots from COVID-19 subjects exhibited a denser fibrin network, thinner fibers and lower fibrin resolvability. ConclusionsElevated histones, aberrant fibrin formation, and increased endothelial-dependent thrombin generation in COVID-19 may contribute to coagulopathy.

Radical cystectomy is the standard treatment. However, due to surgery and postoperative complications, the quality of life of patients is seriously affected. Therefore, it is increasingly important to find prognostic markers and new therapeutic targets for MIBC. Here, we investigated the expression of PDK1, a key regulator of glucose metabolism, in bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA) and its effect on prognosis. The expression pattern of PDK1 was examined by bioinformatics analysis and immunohistochemistry. A total of 101 cases of BLCA were selected for tissue microarrays (TMAs) that contained both tumour and paired normal tissues. We demonstrated that PDK1 expression was correlated with tumour grade and Ki67expression in our TMA cohort (all p values < 0.05). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that patients with MIBC with high PDK1 expression had a worse prognosis than patients with low PDK1 expression (p = 0.016). Multifactor risk analysis showed that increased PDK1 expression was an independent prognostic factor affecting the overall survival of MIBC patients. GSEA showed that the mTOR pathway, HIF pathway, glycolysis, PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling, etc. were differentially enriched in the PDK1 high expression phenotype. Hence, PDK1 may be a prognostic and therapeutic target for MIBC.","Zhu, Jinfeng; Zheng, Guihua; Xu, Haifei; Jin, Xiaoxia; Tang, Ting; Wang, Xiaolin",Virchows arch,411,20

Pulmonary embolism as well as microembolization of vital organs may in these individuals be direct causes of death. The identification of patients at high risk of developing thrombosis may lead to targeted, more effective prophylactic treatment. The primary aim of this study was to test whether rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) at admission indicates hypercoagulopathy and predicts the disease severity, assessed as care level, in COVID-19 patients. The study was designed as a prospective, observational study where COVID-19 patients over 18 years admitted to hospital were eligible for inclusion. Patients were divided into two groups depending on care level: (1) regular wards or (2) wards with specialized ventilation support. Conventional coagulation tests, blood type and ROTEM were taken at admission. 60 patients were included; age 61 (median), 67% men, many with comorbidities (e.g. hypertension, diabetes). The ROTEM variables Maximum Clot Firmness (EXTEM-/FIBTEM-MCF) were higher in COVID-19 patients compared with in healthy controls (p < 0.001) and higher in severely ill patients compared with in patients at regular wards (p < 0.05). Our results suggest that hypercoagulopathy is present early in patients with mild to moderate disease, and more pronounced in severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Non-O blood types were not overrepresented in COVID-19 positive patients. ROTEM variables showed hypercoagulopathy at admission and this pattern was more pronounced in patients with increased disease severity.

Diffuse alveolar injury from SARS-CoV-2 increases risk of alveolar rupture. Pneumothorax is a rare complication that has been documented in the literature. Objective: The study aims to investigate the significance of pneumothorax as a complication in patients with previously healthy lungs with acute respiratory failure due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: This is a case-control study of adult patients without existing lung disease managed for acute respiratory failure who developed pneumothorax as a complication of the disease. Patients with iatrogenic or traumatic pneumothorax, history of chronic lung disease, or previous pneumothorax were excluded. To avoid sample bias from excluding possible false-negatives, the control group (documented SARSCoV- 2 negative) also included patients from the same time period without SARS-CoV-2 testing and a remote unexposed group from a year before. Chi-square analysis was used to determine the relationship between the development of pneumothorax and SARS-CoV-2 infection, with the null hypothesis being no difference in the frequency of pneumothorax among positive SARS-CoV-2 patients and negative SARS-CoV-2 patients. Results: One-hundred-and-thirty charts of patients with symptoms of SAR-CoV-2 were reviewed. Thirty-four patients were documented to be SARS-CoV-2 positive, twelve of which had pneumothorax as a complication of the disease, ninety-one percent of whom were mechanically-ventilated. The control group had ninety-six patients with documented SARS-CoV-2 negative tests, were untested, or part of the historical group. Six patients from the control group had pneumothorax as a complication, two of which were negative for SARS-CoV-2, and three were untested. A Chi-square analysis yielded an X2 statistic of 17.7549 with a p-value of 0.000025.Discussion: Pvalue rejects the null hypothesis in 0.1, 0.05, and 0.01 levels of significance which means that there is a statistically significant difference in the frequency of pneumothorax between the case and control groups. Calculations were done under the assumption that those with negative SARS-CoV-2 tests were indeed free of the virus. There is a probability of underestimation as the tests used may have not been 100-percent sensitive. The four cases of pneumothorax in the control group may have been false-negatives as these patients exhibited imaging findings suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and were likely infected with the virus as well.Conclusion: Pneumothorax is a significant complication in patients without existing lung disease who develop acute respiratory failure and SARS-CoV-2 infection. It should be anticipated and suspected when clinical deterioration occurs especially in mechanically-ventilated patients. .","Tan, Z. C.; Sajja, P.; Afable, R.; Aung, A.

Massive network data traffic and resource optimization requests make traditional network architectures unable to calmly deal with the impact of COVID-19. Artificial intelligence (AI) can effectively raise the upper limit of the medical and health network, as evidenced by the ever-increasing restorative clinical data. In addition, the development of next-generation network (NGN) technologies based on machine learning (ML) has created unlimited possibilities for the emergence of emerging medical methods. In order to reflect the effective results of the current application of AI technologies in the fight against the COVID-19 epidemic and provide a reliable guarantee for subsequent diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 epidemics, a series of AI technologies which can be used in the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 are systematically summarized and analyzed. Based on various AI technologies and methods, we try to propose an AI-based medical network architecture. The architecture uses AI technologies to quickly and effectively realize the monitoring, diagnosis and treatment of patients. Finally, we rationally analyzed the technical challenges and practical problems that may be faced in implementing the architecture.

Due to the absence of vaccines and drugs that can help to fight it, the world solution to control the spread has been to consider public social distance measures that avoids the saturation of the health system. In this context, we investigate a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework to determine the time and duration of social distancing policies. We use Brazilian data in the period from March to May of 2020. The available data regarding the number of infected individuals and deaths suffers from sub-notification due to the absence of mass tests and the relevant presence of the asymptomatic individuals. We estimate variations of the SIR model using an uncertainty-weighted Least-Squares criterion that considers both nominal and inconsistent-data conditions. Moreover, we add to our versions of the SIR model an additional dynamic state variable to mimic the response of the population to the social distancing policies determined by the government that affects the speed of COVID-19 transmission. Our control framework is within a mixed-logical formalism, since the decision variable is forcefully binary (the existence or the absence of social distance policy). A dwell-time constraint is included to avoid harsh shifting between these two states. Finally, we present simulation results to illustrate how such optimal control policy would operate. These results point out that no social distancing should be relaxed before mid August 2020. If relaxations are necessary, they should not be performed before the beginning this date and should be in small periods, no longer than 25 days. This paradigm would proceed roughly until January/2021. The second peak of infections, which has a forecast to the beginning of October, can be reduced if the periods of no-isolation days are shortened.","Morato, Marcelo Menezes; Bastos, Saulo Benchimol; Cajueiro, Daniel Oliveira; Normey-Rico, Julio Elias",,411,14

Until now, there have been no clear markers to guide decision making regarding the appropriateness of invasive ventilation in cancer patients affected by COVID-19 infection. We developed a practical tool encompassing a prognostic score, ""The Milano Policlinico ONCOVID-ICU score."" The score is composed of three groups of variables: patient's characteristics such as sex, age, BMI, and comorbidities; oncological variables (treatment intent, life expectancy, on or off-treatment status); and clinical parameters in association with laboratory values (the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and D-dimer). The SOFA score includes six different clinical parameters and during the first few days of ICU admissions has an important prognostic role. The oncological history should never represent, per se, a contraindication to intensive care and must be considered together with other variables, such as laboratory values, clinical parameters, and patient characteristics, in order to make the hardest but best possible choice. To our knowledge, ""The Milano Policlinico ONCOVID-ICU score"" is the first prognostic score proposed in this setting of patients and requires further validation.

Not only has COVID-19 struck the economy and public health, but it also has deep influences on people's feelings. Twitter, as an active social media, is a great database where we can investigate people's sentiments during this pandemic. By conducting sentiment analysis on Tweets using advanced machine learning techniques, this study aims to investigate how public sentiments respond to the pandemic from March 2 to May 21, 2020 in New York City, Los Angeles, London, and another six global mega-cities. Results showed that across cities, negative and positive Tweet sentiment clustered around mid-March and early May, respectively. Furthermore, positive sentiments of Tweets from New York City and London were positively correlated with stricter quarantine measures, although this correlation was not significant in Los Angeles. Meanwhile, Tweet sentiments of all three cities did not exhibit a strong correlation with new cases and hospitalization. Last but not least, we provide a qualitative analysis of the reasons behind differences in correlations shown above, along with a discussion of the polarizing effect of public policies on Tweet sentiments. Thus, the results of this study imply that Tweet sentiment is more sensitive to quarantine orders than reported statistics of COVID-19, especially in populous megacities where public transportation is heavily relied upon, which calls for prompt and effective quarantine measures during contagious disease outbreaks.","Yao, Zhirui Yang Junyan Liu Jialin Keith Michael Guan ChengHe",Cities,411,3

DESIGN: Population based cohort study, on behalf of NHS England. SETTING: Primary care data and pseudonymously linked hospital and intensive care admissions and death records from England, during wave 1 (1 February to 31 August 2020) and wave 2 (1 September to 18 December 2020). PARTICIPANTS: Two cohorts of adults (18 years and over) registered at a general practice on 1 February 2020 and 1 September 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Adjusted hazard ratios for SARS-CoV-2 infection, covid-19 related admission to hospital or intensive care, or death from covid-19, by presence of children in the household. RESULTS: Among 9 334 392adults aged 65 years and under, during wave 1, living with children was not associated with materially increased risks of recorded SARS-CoV-2 infection, covid-19 related hospital or intensive care admission, or death from covid-19. In wave 2, among adults aged 65 years and under, living with children of any age was associated with an increased risk of recorded SARS-CoV-2 infection (hazard ratio 1.06 (95% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.08) for living with children aged 0-11 years; 1.22 (1.20 to 1.24) for living with children aged 12-18 years) and covid-19 related hospital admission (1.18 (1.06 to 1.31) for living with children aged 0-11; 1.26 (1.12 to 1.40) for living with children aged 12-18). Living with children aged 0-11 was associated with reduced risk of death from both covid-19 and non-covid-19 causes in both waves; living with children of any age was also associated with lower risk of dying from non-covid-19 causes. For adults 65 years and under during wave 2, living with children aged 0-11 years was associated with an increased absolute risk of having SARS-CoV-2 infection recorded of 40-60 per 10 000 people, from 810 to between 850 and 870, and an increase in the number of hospital admissions of 1-5 per 10 000 people, from 160 to between 161 and 165. Living with children aged 12-18 years was associated with an increase of 160-190 per 10 000 in the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections and an increase of 2-6 per 10 000 in the number of hospital admissions. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to wave 1, evidence existed of increased risk of reported SARS-CoV-2 infection and covid-19 outcomes among adults living with children during wave 2. However, this did not translate into a materially increased risk of covid-19 mortality, and absolute increases in risk were small.","Forbes, Harriet; Morton, Caroline E; Bacon, Seb; McDonald, Helen I; Minassian, Caroline; Brown, Jeremy P; Rentsch, Christopher T; Mathur, Rohini; Schultze, Anna; DeVito, Nicholas J; MacKenna, Brian; Hulme, William J; Croker, Richard; Walker, Alex J; Williamson, Elizabeth J; Bates, Chris; Mehrkar, Amir; Curtis, Helen J; Evans, David; Wing, Kevin; Inglesby, Peter; Drysdale, Henry; Wong, Angel Y S; Cockburn, Jonathan; McManus, Robert; Parry, John; Hester, Frank; Harper, Sam; Douglas, Ian J; Smeeth, Liam; Evans, Stephen J W; Bhaskaran, Krishnan; Eggo, Rosalind M; Goldacre, Ben; Tomlinson, Laurie A",BMJ,411,10

This study examines the effect of quarantine on young adults by assessing depression, anxiety, stress and the experience of positive and negative affect. The role of potential risk factors such as disruption of normal life, perceived threat of the disease, acquaintance with someone infected and gender; and protective factors, such as adherence to a daily routine and altruism was evaluated. An online questionnaire entailing demographics, the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21), the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), measures of life disruption, perceived threat and adherence to a daily routine and an altruism scale was completed by 1018 undergraduates. Increased levels of depression, anxiety, stress and negative affect were found. Life disruption and perceived threat of the disease were risk factors in all psychological distress measures, while a stable, satisfying daily routine and altruism mitigated the negative consequences. Gender was a moderator. Acknowledging the psychological effect of quarantine on young adults should be the starting point for interventions. Helping people build a new routine and assign an altruistic meaning to the confinement can protect psychological health.","Kornilaki, Ekaterina N",,411,20

This represents the commonest mode of coronavirus infection and spread to mucous membranes of the respiratory system. The virus rapidly replicates in alveolar cells, triggering a strong immune response, resulting in cytokine storm syndromes and pulmonary tissue damage. These pathologic processes contribute to a compromised pulmonary function. Thus, evaluation of pulmonary function would give insights into modulatory effect of agents that may be beneficial in ameliorating this pathology. The study evaluated effects of Cov-Pla1 and Cov-Pla3 (polyherbal products of the research team, positioned for treatment of Covid-19) on pulmonary function in bleomycin-induced lung injury in rabbits. Rabbits of both sexes were divided into six groups and treated with the extracts alone or the extract following pre-treatment with bleomycin. Targeted respiratory function parameters were monitored at baseline and on day three. Vital capacity, tidal volume, inspiratory reserve volume and inspiratory capacity in the groups treated with Cov-Pla1 and Cov-Pla3 at 125 and 500 mg/kg respectively were compared with the bleomycin only group. In bleomycin pre-treated groups, the two preparations at 125 mg/kg showed increased vital capacity compared to the bleomyicn only group. This pattern was repeated with the other parameters that were evaluated. These results imply that Cov-Pla1 and Cov-Pla3 at the 125 mg/kg dose have ameliorative effects on bleomycin induced lung injury and could be beneficial in situations such as COVID-19 where there are active insults to the respiratory system.","Falang, K.

DESIGN: Multinational network cohort study. SETTING: Hospital electronic health records from the United States, Spain, and China, and nationwide claims data from South Korea. PARTICIPANTS: 303 264 patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 from January 2020 to December 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prescriptions or dispensations of any drug on or 30 days after the date of hospital admission for covid-19. RESULTS: Of the 303 264 patients included, 290 131 were from the US, 7599 from South Korea, 5230 from Spain, and 304 from China. 3455 drugs were identified. Common repurposed drugs were hydroxychloroquine (used in from <5 (<2%) patients in China to 2165 (85.1%) in Spain), azithromycin (from 15 (4.9%) in China to 1473 (57.9%) in Spain), combined lopinavir and ritonavir (from 156 (<2%) in the VA-OMOP US to 2,652 (34.9%) in South Korea and 1285 (50.5%) in Spain), and umifenovir (0% in the US, South Korea, and Spain and 238 (78.3%) in China). Use of adjunctive drugs varied greatly, with the five most used treatments being enoxaparin, fluoroquinolones, ceftriaxone, vitamin D, and corticosteroids. Hydroxychloroquine use increased rapidly from March to April 2020 but declined steeply in May to June and remained low for the rest of the year. The use of dexamethasone and corticosteroids increased steadily during 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple drugs were used in the first few months of the covid-19 pandemic, with substantial geographical and temporal variation. Hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, lopinavir-ritonavir, and umifenovir (in China only) were the most prescribed repurposed drugs. Antithrombotics, antibiotics, H2 receptor antagonists, and corticosteroids were often used as adjunctive treatments. Research is needed on the comparative risk and benefit of these treatments in the management of covid-19.","Prats-Uribe, Albert; Sena, Anthony G; Lai, Lana Yin Hui; Ahmed, Waheed-Ul-Rahman; Alghoul, Heba; Alser, Osaid; Alshammari, Thamir M; Areia, Carlos; Carter, William; Casajust, Paula; Dawoud, Dalia; Golozar, Asieh; Jonnagaddala, Jitendra; Mehta, Paras P; Gong, Mengchun; Morales, Daniel R; Nyberg, Fredrik; Posada, Jose D; Recalde, Martina; Roel, Elena; Shah, Karishma; Shah, Nigam H; Schilling, Lisa M; Subbian, Vignesh; Vizcaya, David; Zhang, Lin; Zhang, Ying; Zhu, Hong; Liu, Li; Cho, Jaehyeong; Lynch, Kristine E; Matheny, Michael E; You, Seng Chan; Rijnbeek, Peter R; Hripcsak, George; Lane, Jennifer Ce; Burn, Edward; Reich, Christian; Suchard, Marc A; Duarte-Salles, Talita; Kostka, Kristin; Ryan, Patrick B; Prieto-Alhambra, Daniel",BMJ,411,24

Recent studies have reported the detrimental effects of the pandemic on neurosurgery residents in North America, Asia, and Italy. However, the impact of the pandemic on neurosurgical training in Latin America and Spain has not yet been reported. In the present report, we describe effects of COVID-19 on training and working conditions of neurosurgery residents in these countries. METHODS: An electronic survey with 33 questions was sent to neurosurgery residents between September 7, 2020 and October 7, 2020. Statistical analysis was made in SPSS version 25. RESULTS: A total of 293 neurosurgery residents responded. The median age was 29.47 ± 2.6 years, and 79% (n = 231) were male. Of respondents, 36.5% (n = 107) were residents training from Mexico; 42% surveyed reported COVID symptoms and 2 (0.7%) received intensive care unit care; 61.4% of residents had been tested for COVID and 21.5% had a positive result; 84% of the respondents mentioned persisted with the same workload (&#8805;70 hours per week) during the pandemic. Most residents from Mexico were assigned to management of patients with COVID compared with the rest of the countries (88% vs. 68.3%; P < 0.001), mainly in medical care (65.4% vs. 40.9%; P < 0.001), mechanical ventilators (16.8% vs. 5.9%; P = 0.003), and neurologic surgeries (94% vs. 83%; P = 0.006).

Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of data from a 2 hospital academic medical centers and 2 urgent care centers during the initial 2 weeks of testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) , March 10, 2020 to March 23, 2020. Testing was targeted toward high-risk patients following US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. Demographics include age group and sex. Laboratory test results included SARS-CoV-2, rapid influenza A/B, and upper respiratory pathogen nucleic acid detection. Patient demographics and coinfections are presented overall and by test results with descriptive statistics. Results: Complete laboratory results from the first 2 weeks of testing were available for 471 emergency department patients and 117 urgent care center patients who were tested for SARS-CoV. A total of 51 (8.7%) patients tested positive for COVID-19 with only 1 of these patients also testing positive for another respiratory infection. One of the patients positive for COVID-19 also tested positive for influenza A. Among the 537 patients who were screened and tested negative for COVID-19, there were 33 (6.1%) patients who tested positive in the upper respiratory pathogen nucleic acid detection test. Conclusion: In our study investigating coinfections among 51 patients testing positive for COVID-19, 1 patient also tested positive for influenza A. Although we found limited coinfections in our emergency department and urgent care center patient populations, further research is needed to assess potential coinfection in patients with COVID-19.","Castillo, Edward M; Coyne, Christopher J; Brennan, Jesse J; Tomaszewski, Christian A",,411,16

The analysis of the literature of Russian and foreign researchers on the extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 is carried out. The main target of COVID-19 (CoronaVIrus Disease 2019) is the vascular endothelium. To enter cells, the virus uses a receptor - angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). It has been shown that up to three viruses can attach to one target. Skeletal muscles also have ACE2. In COVID-19, involvement of the muscular system in the pathological process is a predictor of a poor prognosis. In 20% of hospitalized COVID 19 patients, laboratory signs of heart muscle damage are found. The main mechanisms of muscle damage in COVID 19 include ACE2-dependent, viral load, cytokine storm, acute hypoxemia, and drug toxicity. Damage to the muscular system in COVID 19 is an additional risk factor for death.

Here, I use semistructured interviews of employees at two field sites, in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda and Loango National Park, Gabon, to understand if their employment influenced their attitude towards gorillas and conservation and led to behavior change. In contrast to western views of gorillas as ""gentle giants,"" staff viewed gorillas as dangerous animals before working for these projects. Overall, employment leads to viewing conservation and gorillas more positively, and in many cases, viewing the gorillas as kin. The most common value attributed to the gorillas was economic, yet intrinsic and non-use existence values were frequently mentioned. Loango staff, but not Bwindi staff, reported behavior change related to hunting and bushmeat consumption, which likely is related to bushmeat consumption being commonplace in Gabon but not in Uganda. The Bwindi staff seemed to have a more positive and broader outlook toward conservation than the Loango staff, possibly because they had more years of formal education, they worked with gorillas longer, there is more history of conservation activities in Bwindi, and/or they have been less directly affected by negative consequences of conservation (e.g., crop raiding). This study shows the importance of explaining that gorillas are not dangerous if not provoked and using their human-like characteristics as a means to change conservation values and interest of local communities, while concurrently recognizing that providing economic benefits and reducing negative effects of wildlife are a reality for conservation buy-in.","Robbins, Martha M",Am J Primatol,411,8

Several viral epidemics such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 to 2003 and H1N1 influenza in 2009 were reported since last two decades. Moreover, the Saudi Arabia was the epicenter for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012. The CoVs are large family with single-stranded RNA viruses (+ssRNA).

The COVID-19 composed of exposed densely glycosylated spike protein (S) determines virus binding and infiltrate into host cells as well as initiate protective host immune response. Recently published reviews on the emerging SARS-CoV-2 have mainly focused on its structure, development of the outbreak, relevant precautions and management trials. Currently, there is an urgency of pharmacological intervention to combat this deadly infectious disease. Elucidation of molecular mechanism of COVID-19 becomes necessary.

The uncertainty about employment expectancies can engender crippling anxiety, especially in a time of a major pandemic-COVID-19, and urgent attention is needed. This study, drawing on the self-determination theory, demonstrates preliminary protective effect of positive psychological capital (PsyCap) on employment anxiety among a relatively understudied group-graduating college students (Chinese sample = 546). It further illustrates the mediating mechanism of coping styles in this relation. Thus, the motivational impetus of PsyCap facilitates positive coping style (PCS) while diminishing negative coping style (NCS) which, in turn, hinders students' employment anxiety. Furthermore, the results revealed that students' internship experience strengthens the influence of graduating students' PsyCap on their PCS, but that with NCS and anxiety was nonsignificant. This research proffers valuable insights on college students' from-school-to-work transition for higher education institutions and career counselors, particularly in this turbulent labor market.","Belle, M.

This study compared the severity of pre-pandemic symptoms and affective experiences to current symptoms to evaluate this possibility. METHODS: 148 individuals with SMI (92 with schizophrenia spectrum illnesses and 56 with affective disorders) were recruited from ongoing ecological momentary assessment studies that sampled day-to-day experiences and symptom severity prior to the pandemic. Participants completed a one-time phone survey that queried these same experiences/symptoms between April and June of 2020. RESULTS: Severity of affective experiences and psychotic symptoms remained stable across time, as did sleep duration. Well-being and the number of substances used increased during the early months of the pandemic. Increases in well-being were associated with being female and spending less time alone pre-pandemic. Patterns of stability/change did not differ according to diagnostic category. CONCLUSIONS: At this relatively early stage, individuals with SMI are not reporting a worsening of symptoms or affective experiences and instead appear to be resilient in the face of the pandemic. Continued assessment is needed to determine whether this resilience will persist as the pandemic progresses.","Pinkham, Amy E; Ackerman, Robert A; Depp, Colin A; Harvey, Philip D; Moore, Raeanne C",Psychiatry Res,411,26

To investigate the association of the pandemic-related impacts with the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among patients with melanoma during the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted a cross-sectional study among Chinese patients with melanoma. A self-administered online questionnaire was distributed to melanoma patients through social media. Demographic and clinical data, and pandemic-related impacts (unemployment and income loss) were collected. HRQoL was determined by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) and its disease-specific module (the melanoma subscale, MS). A total of 135 patients with melanoma completed the study. The mean age of the patients was 55.8 ± 14.2 years, 48.1% (65/135) were male, and 17.04% (34/135) were unemployed since the epidemic. Unemployment of the patients and their family members and income loss were significantly associated with a lower FACT-G score, while the MS score was associated with the unemployment of the patients' family members. Our findings suggested that unemployment is associated with impaired HRQoL in melanoma patients during the COVID-19 epidemic.","Guo, Yeye; Shen, Minxue; Zhang, Xu; Xiao, Yi; Zhao, Shuang; Yin, Mingzhu; Bu, Wenbo; Wang, Yan; Chen, Xiang; Su, Juan",Front Public Health,411,10

It is unknown how this affected people living with HIV (PLHIV), who already experience disproportionate levels of mental health issues, comorbidity, and stigma. An online survey was designed with HIV community-based organizations to investigate the impact of the pandemic on Victorian PLHIV. Participants were recruited voluntarily both through social media and Infectious Diseases clinics at participating hospitals. There were 153 respondents. Most were male (77%), aged between 30 and 60 years (77%), and Australian-born (63%).

Institutions, involved in training the next generation of ophthalmologists, are using alternative teaching methods to maintain the standard of education. METHODS: We conducted a worldwide survey among physicians, who are actively involved in Ophthalmology-related education, between 3 and 14 April 2020. The expert survey, developed on the basis of literature search and focus group discussions, comprised 23 questions addressing the use of e-learning in Ophthalmology during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 321 participants from both academic and non-academic institutions worldwide, with variable practice experience and expertise, completed the survey. Before the pandemic, the majority of participants used traditional training modalities, including lectures, grand rounds and journal clubs, and 48% did not use any e-learning. There was a statistically significant increase in the use of all e-learning alternatives during the pandemic (p < 0.001), associated mainly with the availability of e-learning facilities (p < 0.001) and the academic character of institutions (p < 0.001). Zoom® was recognized as the mostly used platform for virtual teaching. Although theoretical teaching may take place, the surgical training of residents/fellows was dramatically reduced. The latter was significantly associated with participants' perspectives about teaching practices (p < 0.001).

As input data, we used COVID-19 epidemiological information collected in fifteen European countries either in private surveys or using official statistics. Thirteen countries implemented lockdown measures, two countries (Sweden, Iceland) not. As output parameters, we studied herd immunity level and time of formation. Comparison of these parameters was used as an indicator of effectiveness / ineffectiveness of lockdown measures. In the absence of a medical vaccine, herd immunity may be regarded as a factor of population adaptation to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2, the viral pathogen causing COVID-19 disease (SARS-CoV-2), and hence COVID-19 spreading stop. We demonstrated that there is no significant difference between lockdown and no-lockdown modes of COVID-19 containment, in terms of both herd immunity level and the time of achieving its maximum. The rationale for personal and business lockdowns may be found in the avoidance of healthcare system overburdening. However, lockdowns do not prevent any virus with droplet transmission (including SARS-CoV-2) from spreading. Therefore, in case of a future viral pathogen emergence, lockdown measures efficiency should not be overestimated, as it was done almost universally in the world during COVID-19 pandemic.","Sharov, Konstantin S",Chaos Solitons Fractals,411,20

In this context, our study retrospectively analysed the management strategy for patients with acute cholecystitis. METHODS: We analysed all patients admitted to our Emergency Department for acute cholecystitis between February and April 2020 and we graded each case according to 2018 Tokyo Guidelines. All patients were tested for positivity to SARS-CoV-2 and received an initial conservative treatment. We focused on patients submitted to cholecystostomy during the acute phase of pandemic and their subsequent disease evolution. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were admitted for acute cholecystitis (13 grade I, 16 grade II, 8 grade III). According to Tokyo Guidelines (2018), patients were successfully treated with antibiotic only, bedside percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage (PC) and laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) in 29.7%, 21.6% and 48.7% of cases respectively. Therapeutic strategy of three out of 8 cases, otherwise fit for surgery, submitted to bedside percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage (37.5%), were directly modified by COVID-19 pandemic: one due to the SARS-CoV-2 positivity, while two others due to unavailability of operating room and intensive care unit for post-operative monitoring respectively. Overall success rate of percutaneous cholecystostomy was of 87.5%. The mean post-procedural hospitalization length was 9 days, and no related adverse events were observed apart from transient parietal bleeding, conservatively treated. Once discharged, two patients required readmission because of acute biliary symptoms. Median time of drainage removal was 43 days and only 50% patients thereafter underwent cholecystectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous cholecystostomy has shown to be an effective and safe treatment thus acquiring an increased relevance in the first phase of the pandemic. Nowadays, considering we are forced to live with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, PC should be considered as a virtuous, alternative tool for potentially all COVID-19 positive patients and selectively for negative cases unresponsive to conservative therapy and unfit for surgery.","Barabino, Matteo; Piccolo, Gaetano; Trizzino, Arianna; Fedele, Veronica; Ferrari, Carlo; Nicastro, Vincenzo; Pisani Ceretti, Andrea; De Nicola, Enrico; Mariani, Nicolò Maria; Giovenzana, Marco; Scifo, Giovanna; Mazza, Massimiliano; Vercelli, Ruggero; Santambrogio, Roberto; Luigiano, Carmelo; Opocher, Enrico",BMC Surg,411,16

STUDY DESIGN: Online survey. METHODS: The survey was conducted in June 2020. Forty organisations from 21 countries across Europe responded through a mix of closed and open-ended answers. RESULTS: During the pandemic, 36 out of 39 of the surveyed organisations (with one non-response) had to postpone or cancel their artistic activities. As the crisis continued, 34 out of 40 of them managed to adapt their in-person activities, but the impact of virtual and distanced interactions with the beneficiaries was generally perceived as lower than that of in-person activities. In open responses, many Healthcare Clowning Organisations criticised the exclusion of medical clowns from healthcare institutions in times when the need for psychosocial support was particularly acute. CONCLUSIONS: The healthcare sector should reconsider the important role the medical clowns play within healthcare settings, and allow for more inclusive and flexible safety regulations that take into consideration the holistic well-being of vulnerable groups, especially children, the elderly, and medical staff.","De Faveri, S; Roessler, M",Public Health,411,5

We performed a single-center, retrospective review of all adult KTRs admitted to the hospital with confirmed COVID-19 between 03/15/2020 and 05/15/2020. Patients were followed from the date of admission up to 1 month following hospital discharge or study conclusion (06/15/2020). Baseline characteristics, laboratory parameters, and immunosuppression were compared between survivors and patients who died to identify predictors of mortality. 38 KTRs with a mean baseline eGFR of 52.5 ml/min/1.73 m2 were hospitalized during the review period. Maintenance immunosuppression included tacrolimus (84.2%), mycophenolate (89.5%), and corticosteroids (81.6%) in the majority of patients. Eleven patients (28.9%) died during the hospitalization. Older age (OR = 2.05; 1.04-4.04), peak D-dimer (OR = 1.20; 1.04-1.39), and peak white blood cell count (OR = 1.11; 1.02-1.21) were all associated with mortality among KTRs hospitalized for COVID-19. Increased mortality was also observed among KTRs with concomitant HIV infection (87.5% vs. 36.1%; p < .01). Conversely, immunosuppression intensity and degree of reduction following COVID-19 diagnosis were not associated with either survival or acute allograft rejection. Our findings potentially support a strategy of individualization of immunosuppression targets based on patient-specific risk factors, rather than universal immunosuppression reduction for KTRs at risk from COVID-19.","Santeusanio, Andrew D; Menon, Madhav C; Liu, Caroline; Bhansali, Arjun; Patel, Niralee; Mahir, Fahima; Rana, Meenakshi; Tedla, Fasika; Mahamid, Ahmad; Fenig, Yaniv; Zendel, Alexey; Delaney, Veronica; De Boccardo, Graciela; Farouk, Samira S; Sehgal, Vinita; Khaim, Rafael; Jacobs, Samantha E; Dunn, Dallas; Sullivan, Timothy; Taimur, Sarah; Baneman, Emily; Florman, Sander; Shapiro, Ron",Clin Transplant,411,16

We calculated the Structure Efficiency Index (IEE) of the states' 92 municipalities and positioned them on the pandemic curve. It was possible to verify that the government of the State of Rio de Janeiro needs to start acting to suppress COVID-19, maintaining the policy of providing more hospital beds, and purchasing equipment. However, it is also necessary to consider the particularities and deficiencies of each region, as the policy to transfer patients to places with available beds can contribute to the spread of the disease.","Silva, Giuliano Alves Borges e; Saraiva, Ernani Viana; Ferreira, Guilherme José Santos Nunes; Peixoto Junior, Rogério de Mesquita; Ferreira, Luiz Felipe",Rev. adm. pública (Online),411,1

METHODS: We conducted a phase 3 multi-centre open-label, randomized 1:1:1:1:1, adaptive, controlled trial (DisCoVeRy), add-on trial to Solidarity (NCT04315948, EudraCT2020-000936-23). The primary outcome was the clinical status at day 15, measured by the WHO 7-point ordinal scale. Secondary outcomes included SARS-CoV-2 quantification in respiratory specimens, pharmacokinetic and safety analyses. We report the results for the lopinavir/ritonavir-containing arms and for the hydroxychloroquine arm, which were stopped prematurely. RESULTS: The intention-to-treat population included 583 participants (lopinavir/ritonavir, n=145; lopinavir/ritonavir-IFN-ß-1a, n=145; hydroxychloroquine, n=145; control, n=148), among whom 418 (71.7%) were male, the median age was 63 years (IQR, 54-71) and 211 (36.2%) had a severe disease. The day-15 clinical status was not improved with investigational treatments: lopinavir/ritonavir versus control, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.83, (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.55-1.26, P=0.39); lopinavir/ritonavir-IFN-ß-1a versus control, aOR 0.69 (95%CI 0.45-1.04, P=0.08); hydroxychloroquine versus control, aOR 0.93 (95%CI 0.62-1.41, P=0.75). No significant effect of investigational treatment was observed on SARS-CoV-2 clearance. Trough plasma concentrations of lopinavir and ritonavir were higher than those expected, while those of hydroxychloroquine were those expected with the dosing regimen. The occurrence of Serious Adverse Events was significantly higher in participants allocated to the lopinavir/ritonavir-containing arms. CONCLUSION: In adults hospitalized for COVID-19, lopinavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir-IFN-ß-1a and hydroxychloroquine did not improve the clinical status at day 15, nor SARS-CoV-2 clearance in respiratory tract specimens.","Ader, Florence; Peiffer-Smadja, Nathan; Poissy, Julien; Bouscambert-Duchamp, Maude; Belhadi, Drifa; Diallo, Alpha; Delmas, Christelle; Saillard, Juliette; Dechanet, Aline; Mercier, Noémie; Dupont, Axelle; Alfaiate, Toni; Lescure, François-Xavier; Raffi, François; Goehringer, François; Kimmoun, Antoine; Jaureguiberry, Stéphane; Reignier, Jean; Nseir, Saad; Danion, François; Clere-Jehl, Raphael; Bouiller, Kévin; Navellou, Jean-Christophe; Tolsma, Violaine; Cabie, André; Dubost, Clément; Courjon, Johan; Leroy, Sylvie; Mootien, Joy; Gaci, Rostane; Mourvillier, Bruno; Faure, Emmanuel; Pourcher, Valérie; Gallien, Sébastien; Launay, Odile; Lacombe, Karine; Lanoix, Jean-Philippe; Makinson, Alain; Martin-Blondel, Guillaume; Bouadma, Lila; Botelho-Nevers, Elisabeth; Gagneux-Brunon, Amandine; Epaulard, Olivier; Piroth, Lionel; Wallet, Florent; Richard, Jean-Christophe; Reuter, Jean; Staub, Thérèse; Lina, Bruno; Noret, Marion",Clin. microbiol. infect,411,3

STUDY DESIGN: An anonymous online survey was disseminated to members of RAS and YFA. Descriptive analyses were performed and factors associated with depression and burnout were examined with univariate and multivariable stepwise logistic regression. RESULTS: Of the RAS/YFA membership of 21,385, there were 1,160 respondents. The majority of respondents (96%) reported the COVID-19 pandemic having a negative impact on their clinical experience, with 84% of residents reporting a > 50% reduction in operative volume and inability to meet minimum case requirements. Respondents also reported negative impacts on personal wellness. Nearly one-third reported inadequate access to personal protective equipment, and depression and burnout were pervasive (&#8805;21% of respondents reported yes to every screening symptom). On multivariable analysis, female sex (odds ratio [OR] 1.54 for depression, OR 1.47 for burnout) and lack of wellness resources (OR 1.55 for depression, OR 1.44 for burnout) predicted depression and burnout. Access to adequate personal protective equipment was protective against burnout (OR 0.52). CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate a significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the lives of residents and early-career surgeons. Actionable items from these data include mitigation of burnout and depression through increasing personal protective equipment access and provision of wellness programs, with a particular focus on high-risk groups.","Coleman, Julia R; Abdelsattar, Jad M; Glocker, Roan J",J.

Whether risk is linked to HIV-related factors, demographics or comorbid burden is unclear. We examine risk factors and outcomes of those living with HIV who acquired COVID-19 and received care within two large healthcare systems in Denver, CO. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted for all individuals with HIV diagnosed with COVID-19 at the two largest Colorado HIV care centers between 1 March and 31 October 2020. COVID-19 diagnosis required a positive PCR result;HIV diagnosis was extracted from the medical record. Risk factors forhospitalization and longer hospital length of stay (LOS) were examined and compared via univariate and multivariable analysis. Results: Among 94 patients, 81% were male, with a mean age of 46 (SD 13.5) years. The majority had HIV-1 RNA levels &lt;50 copies/mL (87%) and CD4 count &gt;500 cells/mm3 (55%). Most (75%) had ≥1 comorbidity;64% were overweight or obese. 39% of patients were admitted to the hospital (17% to intensive care). Increased odds of hospitalization were associated with increased age, lower CD4 count, and increased number of comorbidities (including diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, chronic pulmonary disease, cardiac disease, mental health concerns, and obesity) (Table). In multivariable analyses, only lower CD4 count (OR 1.28) and comorbidity count (OR 1.62) remained significant. Among hospitalized patients, longer LOS was univariately associated with age (52% longer LOS per 10 year age increase [95% CI 16,101%], p=0.004) but not CD4 count (-8%, [95% CI-18, 5%] % change in LOS per 100 cell/mm3 increase, p=0.21), HIV-1 viral load ≥200 copies/mL (-33% [95% CI-77, 90%], p=0.44), or comorbidity count (10% [95% CI-17, 43%] change in LOS per additional comorbidity, p=0.49). Sensitivity analyses excluding 9 patients hospitalized for non-COVID reasons provided similar findings. Conclusion: Lower CD4 count was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization among patients with concurrent HIV and COVID-19, suggesting that successful HIV treatment remains a key component to decreasing HIV-related morbidity.

This joint position statement of Latin American Medical Societies provides an updated guide for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of osteoporotic patients in the face of possible clinical scenarios posed by the COVID-19 health crisis. BACKGROUND: Infection by SARS-Cov-2 (COVID-19) has affected practically all the world. Characterized by high contagiousness, significative morbidity, and mortality in a segment of those infected, it has overwhelmed health services and forced to redirect resources to the emergency while impacting the attention of acute non-COVID-19 and many chronic conditions. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to provide an updated guide for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of osteoporotic patients in the face of possible clinical scenarios posed by the COVID-19 health crisis. METHODS: A task force, of bone specialists with a wide range of disciplines in the field of osteoporosis and fragility fracture, was convened with the representation of several professional associations, namely, the Mexican Association of Bone and Mineral Metabolism (AMMOM), the National College of Geriatric Medicine (CONAMEGER), the Latin American Federation of Endocrinology (FELAEN), the Mexican Federation of Colleges of Obstetrics and Gynecology (FEMECOG), the Mexican Federation of Colleges of Orthopedics and Traumatology (FEMECOT), and the Institute of Applied Sciences for Physical Activity and Sports of the University of Guadalajara (ICAAFYD). Clinical evidence was collated, and an evidence report was rapidly generated and disseminated. After finding the gaps in the available evidence, a consensus opinion of experts was made. The resulting draft was reviewed and modified accordingly, in 4 rounds, by the participants. RESULTS: The task force approved the initial guidance statements, with moderate and high consensus. These were combined, resulting in the final guidance statements on the (1) evaluation of fracture risk; (2) stratification of risk priorities; (3) indications of bone density scans and lab tests; (4) initiation and continuation of pharmacologic therapy; (5) interruptions of therapy; (6) treatment of patients with incident fracture; (7) physical therapy and fall prevention; and (8) nutritional interventions.

It finds significant effects of higher stringency measures in lowering the reproduction, and a significant shortening effect on the time to the epidemic turning point by applying stronger early counter measures. Epidemic projections under scenarios of the counter measures (China and Korea, the USA and the UK) show substantial reduction in the epidemic size and death by taking earlier and forceful actions. The governments' response before and after the start of the second wave epidemics were alarmingly weak, which made the average duration of the second wave more than doubled that of the first wave.

Using the World Health Organization (WHO) health emergency and disaster risk management (health-EDRM) framework, behavioural measures for droplet-borne communicable diseases and their enabling and limiting factors at various implementation levels were evaluated. SOURCES OF DATA: Keyword search was conducted in PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, Medline, Science Direct, WHO and CDC online publication databases. Using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine review criteria, 10 bottom-up, non-pharmaceutical prevention measures from 104 English-language articles, which published between January 2000 and May 2020, were identified and examined. AREAS OF AGREEMENT: Evidence-guided behavioural measures against transmission of COVID-19 in global at-risk communities were identified, including regular handwashing, wearing face masks and avoiding crowds and gatherings.

Due in part to restrictions imposed to mitigate the spread of the virus, the use of telemedicine within pediatric surgery has significantly expanded. METHODS: Prior to the use of telemedicine within surgery divisions at our institution, pediatric surgeons were surveyed to determine their perspectives on the use of telemedicine. Following the expanded use of telemedicine in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a follow up survey was distributed to determine the impact of telemedicine and the perceived benefits and barriers of continuing its use going forward. RESULTS: The pre-COVID survey was completed by 37 surgeons and the post-COVID survey by 36 surgeons and advanced practice providers across 10 pediatric surgical divisions. General surgeons were the most represented division for both the pre- (25%) and post-COVID (33.3%) survey. Less than 25% of providers reported use of telemedicine at any point in their career prior to COVID-19; but following the expanded use of telemedicine 95% of respondents reported interest in continuing its use. After expansion, 25% of respondents were concerned with the possibility of inaccurate diagnoses when using telemedicine compared to nearly 50% prior to expanded use. CONCLUSION: Following the expanded use of telemedicine within pediatric surgery, there was a decrease in the concern for inaccurate diagnoses and a near uniform desire to continue its use. Going forward, it will be imperative for pediatric surgeons to take an active role in creating a process for implementing telemedicine that best fits their needs and the needs of their patients and patients' families.","Metzger, Gregory A; Cooper, Jennifer; Lutz, Carley; Jatana, Kris R; Nishimura, Leah; Deans, Katherine J; Minneci, Peter C; Halaweish, Ihab",J Surg Res,411,16

The way of splitting and processing the mixture of materials was studied as well as the final properties such as chemical, thermal and mechanical characteristics. The resulting recycled material is a blend of polymers with such mechanical and thermal properties that could be used as an alternative to recycled PP (polypropylene). Avoidance of previous sorting process gives the face mask recycling a new and simplified way of preventing this material to be disposed in environment and an opportunity of second life for the polymers they are made of. With this work we lay the basis to reduce the plastic pollution related with the recommended use of face masks during Covid-19 pandemic.","Crespo, Cristina; Ibarz, Gemma; Sáenz, Carlos; Gonzalez, Pablo; Roche, Sandra",Waste Biomass Valorization,411,16

If coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were a bully picking a fight, they got the first punch in before we even raised a fist. Now, many rounds in, health care teams will have an opportunity to deploy a new weapon against COVID-19. Vaccines are coming. We do not know when, who will pay for them, or the logistical aspects (e.g., storage and administration). We do not even know how effective they will be. Moreover, we must plan for mass vaccination in a chaotic and politically charged context that bears little resemblance to the ones with which we have experience. Nevertheless, in this fight, vaccines could be our winning blow. We are getting better at working with unknowns and in disrupted environments during COVID-19. We have some time to prepare, and we have some extant knowledge and experience in vaccine distribution and uptake. Health care teams can use these to best their adversary, and we can and should begin now. The aim of this article is to discuss how to mobilize interprofessional teams within systems of care to engage best practices in vaccine dissemination and uptake in the unique COVID-19 context. We begin by discussing challenges to dissemination and uptake and then provide solutions using our experiences in the primary care system.

However, it is difficult to trace people who came into contact with an infected person, which causes widespread community transmission and mass infection. To address this problem, we develop an e-government Privacy Preserving Mobile and Fog computing framework entitled PPMF that can trace infected and suspected cases nationwide. We use personal mobile devices with contact tracing app and two types of stationary fog nodes, named Automatic Risk Checkers (ARC) and Suspected User Data Uploader Node (SUDUN), to trace community transmission alongside maintaining user data privacy. Each user's mobile device receives a Unique Encrypted Reference Code (UERC) when registering on the central application. The mobile device and the central application both generate Rotational Unique Encrypted Reference Code (RUERC), which broadcasted using the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology. The ARCs are placed at the entry points of buildings, which can immediately detect if there are positive or suspected cases nearby. If any confirmed case is found, the ARCs broadcast pre-cautionary messages to nearby people without revealing the identity of the infected person. The SUDUNs are placed at the health centers that report test results to the central cloud application. The reported data is later used to map between infected and suspected cases. Therefore, using our proposed PPMF framework, governments can let organizations continue their economic activities without complete lockdown.","Whaiduzzaman, Md; Hossain, Md.

The internet is a major source of health information. eHealth literacy is the ability of individuals to find, assess, and use health information available on the internet. OBJECTIVE: The goals of this study were to assess coronavirus-related eHealth literacy and examine the relationship between eHealth literacy and COVID-19-related knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAPs). METHODS: We conducted a web-based survey of a representative sample of 1074 US adults. We adapted the 8-item eHealth Literacy Scale to develop the Coronavirus-Related eHealth Literacy Scale (CoV-eHEALS) to measure COVID-19-related knowledge, conspiracy beliefs, and adherence to protective behaviors (eg, wearing facial masks and social distancing). Our analyses identified sociodemographic associations with the participants' CoV-eHEALS scores and an association between the CoV-eHEALS measure and COVID-19 KAPs. RESULTS: The internal consistency of the adapted CoV-eHEALS measure was high (Cronbach &#945;=.92). The mean score for the CoV-eHEALS was 29.0 (SD 6.1). A total of 29% (306/1074) of the survey participants were classified as having low coronavirus-related eHealth literacy (CoV-eHEALS score <26). Independent associations were found between CoV-eHEALS scores and ethnicity (standardized ß=-.083, P=.016 for Black participants) and education level (standardized ß=-.151, P=.001 for participants with high-school education or lower). Controlling for demographic characteristics, CoV-eHEALS scores demonstrated positive independent associations with knowledge (standardized ß=.168, P<.001) and adherence to protective behaviors (standardized ß=.241, P<.001) and a negative association with conspiracy beliefs (standardized ß=-.082, P=.009). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an estimate of coronavirus-related eHealth literacy among US adults. Our findings suggest that a substantial proportion of US adults have low coronavirus-related eHealth literacy and are thus at a greater risk of lower and less-protective COVID-19 KAPs. These findings highlight the need to assess and address eHealth literacy as part of COVID-19 control efforts. Potential strategies include improving the quality of health information about COVID-19 available on the internet, assisting or simplifying web-based search for information about COVID-19, and training to improve general or coronavirus-specific search skills.","An, Lawrence; Bacon, Elizabeth; Hawley, Sarah; Yang, Penny; Russell, Daniel; Huffman, Scott; Resnicow, Ken",J Med Internet Res,411,0

Although public perceptions of certain key workers have evolved in this way not all occupations have benefitted from comparable narratives. Using data from 18 police officer interviews, we theorise that the police are constructed as the ‘villains’ of the pandemic, tasked with the ‘dirtier’ responsibilities of enforcing rules that transgress societal order (as opposed to ‘heroes’ performing the more prestigious functions such as saving lives). For this reason, they have not benefitted from the same esteem markers awarded to other key workers, which in turn has had a detrimental effect on their morale. Gratitude, especially experienced via public markers of esteem symbolic of the pandemic, was salient in participants negotiating their ‘dirt’ and occupational prestige.

METHODS: Female Wistar rats (n=47) were anesthetized with pentobarbital, intubated through tracheostomy and submitted to thoracotomy; subsequently a 50-70 mu L volume containing Walkers tumor cells, or the suspension of these same cells, was injected into the lung parenchyma. The study consisted of two phases: in the first a tumor implantation technique was developed and the number of cells required to attain a satisfactory tumor development rate was established. In the second phase, the tumor volume in cm³ (Dxd²/2) was determined through CT scan and necropsis, and the survival rates were analyzed. RESULTS: The overall tumor development rate was 93.3%, or rather, 81.1% in the first phase and 100% in the second. The surgical mortality rate was 17.0%. The average tumor volume was similar (0.099 vs. 0.111 cm³) at CT scan and at necropsis, respectively (r=0.993; p 0.0001). The survival average was about 10 days. CONCLUSION: The high tumor development rate observed and the close correlation between the figures obtained through CT scan and necropsis allow for tomographical tumor growth monitoring and thereby for evaluation of the action of anti-tumor drugs in vivo as well as for analysis of survival rates without the need for sacrificing animals.","Gomes Neto, Antero; Bezerra Gomes de Pinho Pessoa, Breno; Araújo de Aguiar, Silvana; Machado Furtado, Bruno; Odorico Moraes, Manoel; de Albuquerque Ribeiro, Ronaldo",Acta cir. bras.,411,10

a great variability in mortality by Covid-19 among different countries While some countries, such as Greece, Belarus or Ukraine, have a mortality rate of less than 5 cases/100,000 inhabitants, other countries such as Belgium, Spain or the United Kingdom have a mortality rate of well over 50 cases/100,000 inhabitants It is generally considered that the reason for this variability is multifactorial (including political reasons), but there are few studies that associate factors related to this variability The objective of this work was to analyse political risk factors/markers that could explain the variability in mortality due to Covid-19 among different European countries METHODS: This is a retrospective, multinational, ecological study based on the exploitation of the database provided by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control which collects daily information worldwide on new cases and deaths The accumulated mortality of Covid-19 in European countries (with more than 100 deaths on 01/05/2020) was calculated up to 29/05/2020 Political variables were compiled from different sources in the countries included in the study The variables analysed were: the democracy index and the different factors included in it, the country's political system and the country's corruption index On the other hand, specific political measures implemented in the different countries were collected, such as the number of days elapsed from the notification of the first infected person to 100 infected persons, to lockdown, to the closure of schools or the cancelation of meetings The number of people infected up to the date of lockdown was also registered For the statistical analysis of the association between the dependent variable (mortality) and the factors studied, correlation index were calculated, and the association was studied through univariate and multivariate linear regression models RESULTS: At May 1 2020, 27 European countries had at least 100 deaths The mean mortality was 19 83 cases/100,000 inhabitants (SD 22 4) and a median of 7 95 Mortality varied from a minimum of 1 49 cases/100,000 population in Ukraine to 82 19 cases/100,000 population in Belgium About factors analyzed both the democracy index (as well as the factors included in it), the political system (full democracy vs no) and the corruption index were statistically associated with mortality Also, the time until the implementation of the political measures was associated with mortality CONCLUSIONS: In Europe, there is a west to east (from highest to lowest) gradient in the mortality of Covid-19 Some of the observed mortality variability can be explained by political factors OBJETIVO: En Europa hay una gran variabilidad en la mortalidad por Covid-19 entre los diferentes paises Mientras que algunos paises, como Grecia, Bielorrusia o Ucrania, la mortalidad no alcanza los 5 casos por cada 100 000 habitantes actualmente, otros paises como Belgica, Espana o Reino Unido sobrepasan marcadamente los 50 casos por cada 100 000 habitantes En general, se especula en que el motivo de esta variabilidad es multifactorial (entre ellos, motivos de indole politica), pero existen escasos estudios que asocien factores relacionados con esta variabilidad El objetivo de este trabajo fue analizar los factores/marcadores de riesgo de indole politico que pudieran explicar la variabilidad en la mortalidad por Covid-19 entre los diferentes paises europeos METODOS: Estudio ecologico, observacional retrospectivo, de ambito multinacional, basado en la explotacion de la base de datos proporcionada por el European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control que recoge la informacion diaria a nivel mundial de los nuevos casos y fallecidos Se calculo la mortalidad acumulada de Covid-19 en paises europeos (con mas de 100 fallecidos a fecha de 1 de mayo de 2020), hasta el 29 de mayo de 2020 Se recogieron variables de caracter politico de los paises incluidos en el estudio de diferentes fuentes Las variables analizadas fueron: indice de demo racia y los diferentes factores incluidos en el, sistema politico del pais e indice de corrupcion del pais Por otra parte, se recogieron medidas politicas especificas implementadas en los distintos paises, como los dias transcurridos desde la notificacion del primer infectado hasta llegar a los 100 infectados, asi como los dias transcurridos hasta el confinamiento, hasta el cierre de colegios o hasta el cese de reuniones Tambien se recogio el numero de infectados hasta la fecha de confinamiento Para el analisis estadistico de la asociacion entre la variable dependiente (mortalidad) y los factores estudiados se calcularon indices de correlacion, y la asociacion se estudio a traves de modelos de regresion lineal univariante y multivariante RESULTADOS: A fecha de 1 de mayo de 2020, 27 paises europeos contaban con al menos 100 fallecidos La media de la mortalidad fue de 19,83 casos por cada 100 000 hab

The TMPRSS2 gene may be co-expressed with SARS-CoV-2 cell receptor genes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and Basigin (BSG), but only TMPRSS2 demonstrates tissue-specific expression in alveolar cells according to single-cell RNA sequencing data. Our analysis of the structural variability of the TMPRSS2 gene based on genome-wide data from 76 human populations demonstrates that a functionally significant missense mutation in exon 6/7 in the TMPRSS2 gene is found in many human populations at relatively high frequencies, with region-specific distribution patterns. The frequency of the missense mutation encoded by rs12329760, which has previously been found to be associated with prostate cancer, ranged between 10% and 63% and was significantly higher in populations of Asian origin compared with European populations. In addition to single-nucleotide polymorphisms, two copy number variants were detected in the TMPRSS2 gene. A number of microRNAs have been predicted to regulate TMPRSS2 and BSG expression levels, but none of them is enriched in lung or respiratory tract cells. Several well-studied drugs can downregulate the expression of TMPRSS2 in human cells, including acetaminophen (paracetamol) and curcumin. Thus, the interactions of TMPRSS2 with SARS-CoV-2, together with its structural variability, gene-gene interactions, expression regulation profiles, and pharmacogenomic properties, characterize this gene as a potential target for COVID-19 therapy.","Zarubin, Aleksei; Stepanov, Vadim; Markov, Anton; Kolesnikov, Nikita; Marusin, Andrey; Khitrinskaya, Irina; Swarovskaya, Maria; Litvinov, Sergey; Ekomasova, Natalia; Dzhaubermezov, Murat; Maksimova, Nadezhda; Sukhomyasova, Aitalina; Shtygasheva, Olga; Khusnutdinova, Elza; Radzhabov, Magomed; Kharkov, Vladimir",,411,20

Reanalyzing this data, we find that, although the fatality distribution may be compatible with a power-law tail, these results are not conclusive, and other distributions, not fat-tailed, could explain the data equally well. As an example, simulation of a log-normally distributed random variable provides synthetic data whose statistics are undistinguishable from the statistics of the empirical data.

The number of affected cases and deaths continues to rise. Primarily a respiratory illness, COVID-19 is now known to affect various organ systems including peripheral nerve and skeletal muscle. The purpose of this review is to discuss the scope of neuromuscular manifestations and complications of COVID-19. RECENT FINDINGS: Several neuromuscular conditions, including Guillain-Barré syndrome, rhabdomyolysis, and myositis, have been reported in patients infected with COVID-19, but even with a temporal association, a causal relationship remains unproven. Direct invasion of neurons or myocytes by the virus, and immune-mediated injury have been speculated but not consistently demonstrated. In addition to potentially causing the above conditions, COVID-19 can trigger exacerbations of preexisting neuromuscular conditions such as myasthenia gravis, and severe infections can lead to critical illness myopathy/polyneuropathy. SUMMARY: COVID-19 appears to be potentially associated with a wide range of neuromuscular manifestations and complications. Further studies are needed to examine these possible associations, understand the pathogenesis, and develop preventive and treatment strategies.","Suh, Joome; Amato, Anthony A",Curr. opin. neurol,411,26

Key open questions are (1) whether NLRP3 inflammasome activation mainly in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) or rather in non-RPE cells promotes CNV, (2) whether inflammasome activation in CNV occurs via NLRP3 or also through NLRP3-independent mechanisms, and (3) whether complement activation induces inflammasome activation in CNV. Here we show in a neovascular AMD mouse model that NLRP3 inflammasome activation in non-RPE cells but not in RPE cells promotes CNV. We demonstrate that both NLRP3-dependent and NLRP3-independent inflammasome activation mechanisms induce CNV. Finally, we find that complement and inflammasomes promote CNV through independent mechanisms. Our findings uncover an unexpected role of non-NLRP3 inflammasomes for CNV and suggest that combination therapies targeting inflammasomes and complement may offer synergistic benefits to inhibit CNV.","Malsy, Jakob; Alvarado, Andrea C; Lamontagne, Joseph O; Strittmatter, Karin; Marneros, Alexander G",eLife (Cambridge),411,20

Using mandatory large-scale public health interventions including a lockdown with locally varying intensity and duration, China has been successful in controlling the epidemic at an early stage. The epicentre of the pandemic has since shifted to Europe and The Americas. In certain cities and regions, health systems became overwhelmed by high numbers of cases and deaths, whereas other regions continue to experience low incidence rates. Still, lockdowns were usually implemented country-wide, albeit with differing intensities between countries. Compared to its neighbours, Germany has managed to keep the epidemic relatively well under control, in spite of a lockdown that was only partial. In analogy to many countries at a similar stage, Germany is now under increasing pressure to further relax lockdown measures to limit economic and psychosocial costs. However, if this is done too rapidly, Germany risks facing tens of thousands more severe cases of COVID-19 and deaths in the coming months. Hence, it could again follow China's example and relax measures according to local incidence, based on intensive testing.","Müller, Olaf; Lu, Guangyu; Jahn, Albrecht; Razum, Oliver",Int. j. health policy manag,411,13

In the period from March to May 2020, Covid-19 restrictions forced rapid changes in the organization and provision of mental health services through the increased use of digital solutions in therapy. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to develop and advance comprehensive knowledge about how therapists experience the use of VC. In order to reach this objective we draw on a study of therapists' experiences using video consultation (VC) in specialized mental health services in the early phase of the Covid-19 restrictions. The following questions were explored through interviews: Which opportunities and challenges appeared when using VC during the period of the Covid-19 restrictions? In a short-term care pathway, for whom does VC work and for whom does it not work? METHODS: This study employed a qualitative approach, based on an abductive strategy and hermeneutic-phenomenological methodology. Therapists and managers in mental health departments in a hospital were interviewed via Skype for Business from March to May 2020, using a thematic interview guide that aimed to encourage reflections on the use of VC during Covid-19 restrictions. RESULTS: Therapists included in this study experienced advantages using VC in circumstances that did not permit face-to-face consultations. The continuity that video consultations offered the service users was seen as a valuable asset. Various negative aspects concerning the therapeutic environment, such as lack of safety for the most vulnerable service users and topics deemed unsuitable for VC, lowered the therapists' overall impression of the service. The themes that arose in the analysis of the data have been categorized in the following main topics: 1) VC-'it's better than nothing'; 2) VC affects therapists' work situation-opportunities and challenges in working conditions; 3) VC represents challenges when performing professional assessment and therapy on the screen. CONCLUSIONS: Experiences with video consultations in a mental health hospital during Covid-19 restrictions indicate that there are overall advantages to using VC when circumstances do not permit face-to-face consultations. Nevertheless, various negative aspects in the use of VC lowered the therapists' overall impression of VC. Further qualitative research is needed, and future studies should focus on service users' experiences, co-creation between different stakeholders and how to scale up the use of VC while ensuring that the service provided is appropriate, safe and available.","Knudsen Gullslett, Monika; Kristiansen, Eli; Nilsen, Etty Ragnhild",,411,22

A COVID-19-infected surgeon performed surgical activities before being tested. An exposure risk classification was applied to the identified exposed subjects and high- and medium-risk contacts underwent active symptom monitoring for 14 days at home. All healthcare professionals (HCPs) were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) at the end of the quarantine and serological tests were performed. Three household contacts and 20 HCPs were identified as high- or medium-risk contacts and underwent a 14-day quarantine. Fourteen HCPs and 19 patients were instead classified as low risk. All the contacts remained asymptomatic and all HCPs tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. About 25-28 days after their last exposure, HCPs underwent serological testing and two of them had positive IgM but negative confirmatory swabs. In a low COVID-19 burden area, the in-hospital transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from an infectious doctor did not occur and, despite multiple and frequent contacts, a hospital outbreak was avoided. This may be linked to the adoption of specific recommendations and to the use of standard personal protective equipment by HCPs.","Gallo, Oreste; Peris, Adriano; Trotta, Michele; Orlando, Pietro; Maggiore, Giandomenico; Cilona, Maria; Trovati, Massimo; Locatello, Luca Giovanni",Epidemiol Infect,411,20

Our study adds to this literature by utilizing an intersectionality framework to examine the joint influence of race and sex on H1N1 vaccination beliefs and behaviors among non-Hispanic blacks and non-Hispanic whites (hereafter blacks and whites). METHODS: Using data from the National H1N1 Flu Survey of U.S. adults, we measured differences in beliefs about the safety and efficacy of the H1N1 vaccine among black women, black men, white women, and white men. We then estimated a series of nested logistic regression models to examine how race/sex vaccination disparities were influenced by health beliefs, socioeconomic status (SES), pre-existing conditions, and healthcare. RESULTS: Black respondents were more likely than white respondents to express reservations about the safety and efficacy of the H1N1 vaccine. Consistent with those beliefs, white females reported the highest rate of H1N1 vaccination (28.4%), followed by white males (26.3%), black males (21.6%), and black females (17.5%). Differences in health beliefs, SES, pre-existing conditions, and healthcare explained lower odds of H1N1 vaccination among white men and black men, relative to white women. However, black women experienced 35-45% lower odds of vaccination than white women across all models, highlighting the intersectional nature of these associations. DISCUSSION: The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic provides a cautionary tale about the distribution of new vaccines across large populations with diverse racial, sex, and socioeconomic characteristics. Despite differences between the H1N1 and COVID-19 pandemics, our study warns that many black Americans will forego COVID-19 vaccines unless swift action is taken to address black-white disparities in access to vital resources. Public health stakeholders can also encourage widespread adoption of COVID-19 vaccines by tailoring health promotion messages for different groups of racial minorities, especially groups like black women who face intersecting disadvantages.","Burger, Andrew E; Reither, Eric N; Mamelund, Svenn-Erik; Lim, Sojung",Vaccine,411,16

These effects hold even at the lower filtering rates of homemade masks. To validate these theoretical models, we compare their predictions against a new empirical data set we have collected that includes whether regions have universal masking cultures or policies, their daily case growth rates, and their percentage reduction from peak daily case growth rates. Results show a near perfect correlation between early universal masking and successful suppression of daily case growth rates and/or reduction from peak daily case growth rates, as predicted by our theoretical simulations. Our theoretical and empirical results argue for urgent implementation of universal masking.

The main goal was to evaluate lockdown impact on oncologic surgical activity in the departments. Secondary goals were to report population characteristics, surgery conditions, postoperative course, progression of Covid status in patients and surgeons, and adverse events. RESULTS: 224 procedures were performed. There was 10.9% reduction in overall activity, without significant difference between departments. Squamous cell carcinoma and larynx, hypopharynx, oropharynx, oral cavity and nasal cavity and sinus locations were predominant, at 79% and 75.8% of cases respectively, with no significant differences between months.

METHODS: Following the shift to virtual care, Kaiser Permanente Washington implemented a series of workflow changes to administer standard screening and monitoring questionnaires at virtual visits and to complete structured suicide risk assessments for patients reporting frequent suicidal ideation. These new workflows included automated distribution of questionnaires via the electronic health record (EHR) patient portal and automated alerts to clinicians regarding indicators of high risk. RESULTS: In March 2020, in-person mental health visits were rapidly and completely replaced by video and telephone visits. The proportion of mental health visits with completed screening and monitoring questionnaires fell from approximately 80% in early 2020 to approximately 30% in late March, then gradually recovered to approximately 60% by the end of 2020. Among patients reporting frequent suicidal ideation on monitoring questionnaires, the proportion with a recorded suicide risk assessment fell from over 90% in early 2020 to approximately 40% in late March, then gradually recovered to nearly 100% by the end of 2020.

This fact means that we must adapt teaching to non-face-to-face scenarios in order to adapt the teaching processes without the students losing the acquisition of competences. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a digital application for the development of competences of primary education undergraduate students in a non-face-to-face teaching context derived from the pandemic through a service-learning project. To achieve this objective, a specific programme was designed using a collaborative platform. Numerous instruments were used to assess the acquisition of basic, specific, general and transversal competences. On a quantitative level, the Teamworks Skills Questionnaire and an evaluation rubric were used, and on a qualitative level, a student field diary, a survey to measure satisfaction and an observational record were used. The main results show that after the implementation of the use of the platform, both the level of competence of the students and their satisfaction with the project were very high and that the impact on their training was very positive. Among the main conclusions, we highlight that the use of this type of platform allows students to acquire competences in non-classroom contexts.

The aim of this study was to assess changes in STEMI management during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: Using a multicenter, nationwide, retrospective, observational registry of consecutive patients who were managed in 75 specific STEMI care centers in Spain, we compared patient and procedural characteristics and in-hospital outcomes in 2 different cohorts with 30-day follow-up according to whether the patients had been treated before or after COVID-19. RESULTS: Suspected STEMI patients treated in STEMI networks decreased by 27.6% and patients with confirmed STEMI fell from 1305 to 1009 (22.7%). There were no differences in reperfusion strategy (> 94% treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention in both cohorts). Patients treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention during the COVID-19 outbreak had a longer ischemic time (233 [150-375] vs 200 [140-332] minutes, P<.001) but showed no differences in the time from first medical contact to reperfusion. In-hospital mortality was higher during COVID-19 (7.5% vs 5.1%; unadjusted OR, 1.50; 95%CI, 1.07-2.11; P <.001); this association remained after adjustment for confounders (risk-adjusted OR, 1.88; 95%CI, 1.12-3.14; P=.017). In the 2020 cohort, there was a 6.3% incidence of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection during hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: The number of STEMI patients treated during the current COVID-19 outbreak fell vs the previous year and there was an increase in the median time from symptom onset to reperfusion and a significant 2-fold increase in the rate of in-hospital mortality. No changes in reperfusion strategy were detected, with primary percutaneous coronary intervention performed for the vast majority of patients.

New evidence supports a sex-based difference in COVID-19 mortality. Data from the OpenSAFELY cohort study in 17 million adult patients in England demonstrate that COVID-19-related deaths were associated with male sex (hazard ratio 1.59; 95% confidence interval 1.53-1.65) when fully adjusted for age, low income, smoking, pre-existing diseases, and ethnicity. Women have stronger innate and adaptive responses to infection.

METHODS: In this single-center retrospective observational study, we aimed to identify simple laboratory parameters that in combination with ferritin (a surrogate marker of severe inflammation) may help predict early (first 48 hours) MIV. A total of 160 patients with COVID-19 in whom serum ferritin, absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), platelet count, C-reactive protein (CRP), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) had been analyzed at admission were included. RESULTS: We found that ferritin, LDH, ALC, and CRP predicted with 88% accuracy the probability of early MIV. Results indicated that LDH showed the greater area under the curve (AUC), with a value of 89.1%. Using the AUC, we established cutoff values for clinical application. Finally, we developed a classification tree based on LDH for its clinical use.

Disaster planning should be situation specific and data driven; vague, broad-spectrum planning can contribute to unprepared mental health teams and underserved patient populations. Herein, we review data on mental health sequelae from the twenty-first century pandemics, including SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19), and offer explanations for observed trends, insights regarding anticipated needs, and recommendations for preliminary planning on how to best allocate limited mental health resources. RECENT FINDINGS: Anxiety and distress, often attributed to isolation, were the most prominent mental health complaints during previous pandemics and with COVID-19. Additionally, post-traumatic stress was surprisingly common and possibly more enduring than depression, insomnia, and alcohol misuse. Predictions regarding COVID-19's economic impact suggest that depression and suicide rates may increase over time. Available data suggest that the mental health sequelae of COVID-19 will mirror those of previous pandemics. Clinicians and mental health leaders should focus planning efforts on the negative effects of isolation, particularly anxiety and distress, as well as post-traumatic stress symptoms.","Han, Rachel H; Schmidt, Morgan N; Waits, Wendi M; Bell, Alexa K C; Miller, Tashina L",Curr Psychiatry Rep,411,26

Around 70% of the coronavirus positive-sense single-stranded RNA encodes proteins involved in replication, and these viruses essentially take over the biosynthetic and transport mechanisms to ensure the efficient replication of their genome and trafficking of their virions. Some coronaviruses encode genes for ion-channel proteins - the envelope protein E (orf4a), orf3a and orf8 - which they successfully employ to take control of the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi complex intermediate compartment or ERGIC. The E protein, which is one of the four structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, assembles its transmembrane protomers into homopentameric channels with mild cationic selectivity. Orf3a forms homodimers and homotetramers. Both carry a PDZ-binding domain, lending them the versatility to interact with more than 400 target proteins in infected host cells. Orf8 is a very short 29-amino-acid single-passage transmembrane peptide that forms cation-selective channels when assembled in lipid bilayers. This review addresses the contribution of biophysical and structural biology approaches that unravel different facets of coronavirus ion channels, their effects on the cellular machinery of infected cells and some structure-functional correlations with ion channels of higher organisms.","Barrantes, Francisco J",Acta Crystallogr D Struct Biol,411,26

The phylogenetic analysis demonstrated the sequence similarity of SARS-CoV-2 with other SARS-like bat viruses. The primary source and intermediate host are not yet confirmed, although transmission from human to human is universally confirmed. The new SARS-CoV-2 virus reaches cells via ACE-2 and subsequently down-regulates ACE-2, leaving angiotensin II unbalanced in affected organs primarily in the lungs, heart, brain, and kidneys. As reported recently, numerous secondary complications i.e., neurological, nephrological, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, immune, and hepatic complications, are associated with COVID-19 infection along with prominent respiratory disease including pneumonia. Extensive research work on recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 is in the pipeline to clarify pathogenic mechanisms, epidemiological features, and identify new drug targets that will lead to the development of successful strategies for prevention and treatment. There are currently no appropriate scientifically approved vaccines/drugs for COVID-19. Nonetheless, few broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, azithromycin were tested against COVID-19 in clinical trials, and finally, FDA approved emergency use of remdesivir in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Additionally, administration of convalescent plasma obtained from recovered COVID-19 patients to infected COVID-19 patients reduces the viral burden via immunomodulation.

From October 2019 to July 2020, we conducted nine pre- and six post-switch to biosimilar interviews with BC, English speaking participants, who were 18 years or older, and were currently taking a biologic medication. Participants were interviewed pre- and post-switch to a biosimilar medication and interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim for qualitative analysis. Interviews were thematically analysed and major themes and sub-categories were elucidated. The themes derived from pre and post-switch interviews captured participants' anticipated or experienced barriers and enablers to the policy change. In general, the fears and apprehension of participants approaching the switch, including concerns surrounding the efficacy and safety of biosimilars, were addressed by their rheumatologist and social support circles. For the most part, participants were able to successfully manage their disease regardless of their baseline concerns about efficacy and safety. Experiences of changes in health delivery models were also observed secondary to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic amongst participants. This study is the first of its kind to characterize the patient perspective regarding the BC Biosimilars Initiative.

The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between the level of anxiety created by immensely spreading COVID-19-related information and age, gender and the presence of risk factors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The data used in this study were obtained by collecting a 25-question questionnaire created through Google forms with various communication tools. RESULTS: The data of 929 people who answered the questionnaire were used. The level of anxiety increased with age significantly, upon hearing that a person from their age group was harmed by the virus (P < .001). The feelings of being depressed and hopeless significantly increased as the age increased (P < .001). There was no significant difference between the genders in terms of feeling depressed and feeling of lack of joy in life (P = .066, P = .308, respectively). Participants with chronic diseases stated that they felt more depressed and hopeless and a lack of joy in life more frequently (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that individuals with older age and having risk factors were more vulnerable to the stress caused by the pandemic. It is necessary for healthcare providers to identify high-risk groups by considering these situations, in order to make early psychological interventions.","Gamsizkan, Zerrin; Sungur, Mehmet Ali; Erdemir, Gökhan",Int J Clin Pract,411,20

Fasting during illness may contribute to low blood glucose and caretakers' feeding practices during childhood illnesses may thus play a role in the development of low or hypo glycaemia. This study aims to describe the caretaker's feeding practices and association of fasting with low or hypo glycaemia in sick children in Malawi. METHODS: A mixed method approach was used combining quantitative cross-sectional data for children aged 0-17 years admitted to Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (QECH), a tertiary hospital in Malawi, with qualitative focus group discussions conducted with caretakers of young children who were previously referred to QECH from the five health centres around QECH. Logistic regression was used to analyse the quantitative data and thematic content analysis was conducted for qualitative data analysis. RESULTS: Data for 5131 children who were admitted through the hospital's Paediatric Accident and Emergency Department (A&E) were analysed whereof 2.1% presented with hypoglycaemia (< 2.5 mmol/l) and 6.6% with low glycaemia (&#8805;2.5mmoll/l - < 5 mmol/l). Fasting for more than eight hours was associated with low glycaemia as well as hypoglycaemia with Adjusted Odds Ratios (AOR) of 2.9 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) of 2.3-3.7) and 4.6, (95% CI 3.0-7.0), respectively. Caretakers demonstrated awareness of the importance of feeding during childhood illness and reported intensified feeding attention to sick children but face feeding challenges when illness becomes severe causing them to seek care at a health facility. CONCLUSION: Results suggests that caretakers understand the importance of feeding during illness and make efforts to intensify feeding a sick child but challenges occur when illness is severe leading to fasting. Fasting among children admitted to hospitals may serve as a marker of severe illness and determine those at risk of low and hypoglycaemia.","Ngwalangwa, Fatsani; Chirambo, Chawanangwa Mahebere; Lindsjö, Cecilia; Dube, Queen; Langton, Josephine; Baker, Tim; Hildenwall, Helena",BMC Pediatr,411,16

Hospital admissions of IBD patients should be limited to reduce the risks of coronavirus transmission. However, delaying hospitalisation of IBD patients with severe or complicated disease may increase the risk of poor outcomes. Delaying surgery in some cases may increase the risk of disease progression, postoperative morbidity, and disease complications. IBD patients who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 may have a higher risk of poor outcomes than the general population, potentially related to concomitant medications, especially corticosteroids. There is no evidence today that IBD patients with COVID-19 have worse outcomes if they receive immunosuppressant medications including thiopurines, biologics, and novel small molecules.

In this study, the frequency of HLA alleles among Saudi patients infected with COVID-19 was examined. The association with infection susceptibility and mortality was evaluated. This study included 135 Saudi COVID-19-infected patients (106 recovered and 29 died) who were admitted to hospitals because of their symptoms, and 135 healthy controls. HLA class I (A, B, C) and class II (DRB1, DQB1) genotyping was performed using the molecular method (PCR-rSSO). In this study, there was a significant increase in the frequency of HLA-A*01, B*56 and C*01 among infected patients compared to the control group (12.1% vs. 5.2%, p = 0.004, 3.7% vs. 0%, p = 0.006, 4.4% vs. 1.5%, p = 0.042, respectively). Moreover, there was a significant increase in the frequency of HLA-A*03 and C*06 among fatal patients compared to infected patients (13.8% vs. 5.7%, p = 0.036, 32.8% vs. 17.5%, p = 0.011, respectively). In terms of HLA class II, HLA-DRB1*04 was significantly higher in the control group compared to infected patients (27.4% vs. 16.3%, p = 0.002), while HLA-DRB1*08 was significantly higher in the infected group compared to the control (4.8% vs. 0.7%, p = 0.004).

Despite this convergence, it is also clear that the conceptualization and implementation, or goals and outcomes of cashlessness can vary considerably, which indicates the need for a closer look at the Indian case. In this introductory note to the special issue on cashlessness in India, we outline the variety of institutions, stakeholders (regulatory, financial and technological actors), technologies and policies involved. As we have observed, digital payments and financial inclusion are two significant planks of cashlessness in India. Perhaps as a result, digital payments have been intentionally defined in a broad manner in India – ranging from anti-cash to less-cash and now contactless payments in the aftermath of Covid-19. Considering the variety of legal, economic, social and technological concerns involved, this special issue adopts 2 complementary foci to study cashlessness in India: technological visions and the systems undergirding it, and practices of end users. The special issue includes four papers. The first paper argues that the Digital India programme may lead to the commercialization of bias. The second paper historicizes the Indian demonetization of 2016 and examines its stated and unstated goals. The next paper provides a conceptual model on technology adoption in the context of digital payments. The final paper argues that users strategically switch between multiple payments media based on the context in which the transaction is taking place.","Sam, Jillet Sarah Chakraborty Anwesha Srinivasan Janaki",Telecommunications Policy,411,15

We sought to determine the impact of COVID-19 on arthroplasty volumes in the United States, how this varied across the country, and the resultant financial implications. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries undergoing primary and revision total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total hip arthroplasty (THA) from January 1st through March 31st, 2020 with 74,080 TKAs and 54,975 THAs identified. We calculated the percent drop in average daily cases from before and after March 18, 2020. We then examined variation across states in arthroplasty case volumes as it related to reported COVID-19 cases, the impact of COVID-19 on length of stay and percentage of patients discharged home. Finally, we calculated the revenue impact on hospitals and surgeons. RESULTS: There was a steep decline in TKA and THA volumes in mid-March of 94% and 92%, respectively. There was a significant variation for arthroplasty case volumes across states. We found minimal change in length of stay except for primary THAs with fracture going from 5 + days to 4 days. We saw an increasing trend in discharge to home with the greatest effect in primary THAs with fracture. The total daily hospital Medicare revenue for arthroplasty declined by 87% and surgeon revenue decreased by 85%. CONCLUSION: The beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant decrease in arthroplasty volumes in the Medicare population with a resultant substantial revenue loss for hospitals and surgeons.","Barnes, C Lowry; Zhang, Xiaoran; Stronach, Benjamin M; Haas, Derek A",J. arthroplasty,411,2

Among various influenza vaccine types, the inactivated subunit type is known to provide improved safety with reduced reactogenicity. However, there are some drawbacks associated with inactivated subunit type vaccines, with the main ones being its low immunogenicity and the induction of Th2-biased immune responses. In this study, we investigated the role of a single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) derived from the intergenic region in the internal ribosome entry site of the Cricket paralysis virus as an adjuvant rather than the universal vaccine for a seasonal inactivated subunit influenza vaccine. The ssRNA adjuvant stimulated not only well-balanced cellular (indicated by IgG2a, IFN-Î³, IL-2, and TNF-&#945;) and humoral (indicated by IgG1 and IL-4) immune responses but also a mucosal immune response (indicated by IgA), a key protector against respiratory virus infections. It also increases the HI titer, the surrogate marker of influenza vaccine efficacy. Furthermore, ssRNA adjuvant confers cross-protective immune responses against heterologous influenza virus infection while promoting enhanced viral clearance. Moreover, ssRNA adjuvant increases the number of memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, which can be expected to induce long-term immune responses. Therefore, this ssRNA-adjuvanted seasonal inactivated subunit influenza vaccine might be the best influenza vaccine generating robust humoral and cellular immune responses and conferring cross-protective and long-term immunity.","Kim, Yun-Hee; Bang, Yoo-Jin; Park, Hyo-Jung; Li Ko, Hae; Park, Sang-In; Hwang, Kyung-Ah; Kim, Hun; Nam, Jae-Hwan",Vaccine,411,20

For proper translation of these results to clinical guidelines, it is essential to determine how well the general population is reflected in the study populations of these trials. This study was conducted among 7162 participants (age-range: 51-106 years; 58% women) from the Rotterdam Study. We quantified the proportion of participants that would be eligible for the nine ongoing phase-III trials. We further quantified the eligibility among participants at high risk to develop severe COVID-19. Since many trials were not explicit in their exclusion criterion with respect to 'acute' or 'unstable preexisting' diseases, we performed two analyses. First, we included all participants irrespective of this criterion. Second, we excluded persons with acute or 'unstable preexisting' diseases. 97% of 7162 participants was eligible for any trial with eligibility for separate trials ranging between 11-97%. For high-risk individuals the corresponding numbers were 96% for any trial with separate trials ranging from 5-96%. Importantly, considering persons ineligible due to 'acute' or 'unstable pre-existing' disease drastically dropped the eligibilities for all trials below 43% for the total population and below 36% for high-risk individuals. The eligibility for ongoing vaccine trials against SARS-CoV-2 can reduce by half depending on interpretation and application of a single unspecified exclusion criterion. This exclusion criterion in our study would especially affect the elderly and those with pre-existing morbidities. These findings thus indicate the difficulty as well as importance of developing clinical recommendations for vaccination and applying these to the appropriate target populations. This becomes especially paramount considering the fact that many countries worldwide have initiated their vaccination programs by first targeting the elderly and most vulnerable persons.","Terzikhan, Natalie; Hofman, Albert; Goudsmit, Jaap; Ikram, Mohammad Arfan",Eur J Epidemiol,411,26

The objective of this study was to determine the predictive factors of severe hypoxemia in patients hospitalized in COVID-19 health facilities in Burkina Faso. PATIENTS AND METHOD: This study was a hospital-based cross-sectional study. The data collected relate to the period of the first wave of the epidemic (March 9 to June 30, 2020). All patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in the requisitioned health facilities of Ouagadougou were included in this study. Predictors of severe hypoxemia were identified using a multivariate logistic regression model. RESULTS: During the study period, 442 patients were included, representing 45.7% of the total number of positive patients in the entire country. The most common co-morbidities were diabetes (55; 12.4%) and arterial hypertension (97; 21.9%). Severe hypoxemia (SpO2 < 90%) was observed in 64 patients (14.5%). Age over 65 years (OR = 8.24; 95% CI: 2.83-24.01) and diabetes (OR = 2.43; 95% CI: 1.17-5.06) were the predictors for occurrence of severe hypoxemia in multivariate analysis.

The phytochemical structure of Sumac was studied extensively, and it was established that the herb contained tannins, polyphenols, flavonoids, organic acids, and essential oils. Various scientific studies demonstrated that Sumac had a free oxygen radical-scavenging effect, a protective effect against liver damage, antihemolytic, leukopenia, and antifibrogenic effects, along with its antiviral, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. Recently, several scientific studies described the pathophysiology, clinical course, and the treatment of COVID-19 infection. The examination of the characteristics of COVID-19 infection revealed via the clinical studies suggests that Sumac extract could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19. Given the scientific studies focusing on the beneficial effects of Sumac, the present review aims to provide an encouraging viewpoint to investigate whether Sumac is effective in treating COVID-19 infection.","Korkmaz, Hasan",,411,16

As a result, cancer caregivers may have to shoulder triple crises: the COVID-19 pandemic, pronounced healthcare needs from the patient, and elevated need for care from within. While technology-based health interventions have the potential to address unique challenges cancer caregivers face amid COVID-19, limited insights are available. Thus, to bridge this gap, we aim to identify technology-based interventions designed for cancer caregivers and report the characteristics and effects of these interventions concerning cancer caregivers' distinctive challenges amid COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic search of the literature will be conducted in PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Scopus from the database inception to the end of March 2021. Articles that center on technology-based interventions for cancer caregivers will be included in the review. The search strategy will be developed in consultation with an academic librarian who is experienced in systematic review studies. Titles, abstracts, and full-text articles will be screened against eligibility criteria developed a priori. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses procedures will be followed for the reporting process. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has upended cancer care as we know it. Findings of this study can shed light on evidence-based and practical solutions cancer caregivers can utilize to mitigate the unique challenges they face amid COVID-19. Furthermore, results of this study will also offer valuable insights for researchers who aim to develop interventions for cancer caregivers in the context of COVID-19. In addition, we also expect to be able to identify areas for improvement that need to be addressed in order for health experts to more adequately help cancer caregivers weather the storm of global health crises like COVID-19 and beyond.

Appropriate glycemic management contributes to a reduction in adverse clinical outcomes in acute illness but also requires intensive patient interactions for bedside glucose monitoring, intravenous and subcutaneous insulin administration, as well as rapid intervention for hypoglycemia events. These tasks are required at a time when minimizing patient interactions is recommended as a way of avoiding prolonged exposure to COVID-19 by health care personnel who often practice in settings with limited supplies of personal protective equipment. The purpose of this manuscript is to provide guidance for clinicians for reconciling recommended standards of care for infected hospitalized patients with diabetes while also addressing the daily realities of an overwhelmed health care system in many areas of the country. The use of modified protocols for insulin administration, bedside glucose monitoring, and medications such as glucocorticoids and hydroxychloroquine that may affect glycemic control are discussed. Continuous glucose monitoring systems have been proposed as an option for reducing time spent with patients, but there are important issues that need to be addressed if these are used in hospitalized patients. On-site and remote glucose management teams have potential to provide guidance in areas where there are shortages of personnel who have expertise in inpatient glycemic management.","Korytkowski, Mary; Antinori-Lent, Kellie; Drincic, Andjela; Hirsch, Irl B; McDonnell, Marie E; Rushakoff, Robert; Muniyappa, Ranganath",J. clin. endocrinol. metab,411,16

The physical essence of generalized potential promoting the development of nonlinear field is extended and the spatiotemporal evolution law of generalized potential is clarified. Then the spatiotemporal evolution law of conservative system and pure dissipative system is clarified. Acceleration field, conservative vector field and dissipation vector field are established to evaluate the degree of conservation and dissipation of physical field.

METHODS: We implemented AGTEST (here: Roche/SD Biosensor) in all four adult and the one paediatric EDs at Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin in our diagnostic testing strategy. Test indication was limited to symptomatic suspected COVID-19 patients. Detailed written instructions on who to test were distributed and testing personnel were trained in proper specimen collection and handling. In each suspected COVID-19 patient, two sequential deep oro-nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained for viral tests. The first swab was collected for nucleic acid testing through SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse transcriptase (rt)-PCR diagnostic panel (PCRTEST) in the central laboratory. The second swab was collected to perform the AGTEST. Analysis of routine data was prospectively planned and data were retrieved from the medical records after the inclusion period in the adult or paediatric ED. Diagnostic performance was calculated using the PCRTEST as reference standard. False negative and false positive AGTEST results were analysed individually and compared with viral concentrations derived from the calibrated PCRTEST. RESULTS: We included n = 483 patients including n = 202 from the paediatric ED. N = 10 patients had to be excluded due to missing data and finally n = 473 patients were analysed. In the adult cohort, the sensitivity of the AGTEST was 75.3 (95%CI: 65.8/83.4)% and the specificity was 100 (95%CI: 98.4/100)% with a SARS-CoV-2 prevalence of 32.8%; the positive predictive value was 100 (95%CI: 95.7/100)% and the negative predictive value 89.2 (95%CI: 84.5/93.9)%. In the paediatric cohort, the sensitivity was 72.0 (95%CI: 53.3/86.7)%, the specificity was 99.4 (95%CI:97.3/99.9)% with a prevalence of 12.4%; the positive predictive value was 94.7 (95%CI: 78.3/99.7)% and the negative predictive value was 96.2 (95%CI:92.7/98.3)%. Thus, n = 22 adult and n = 7 paediatric patients showed false negative AGTEST results and only one false positive AGTEST occurred, in the paediatric cohort. Calculated viral concentrations from the rt-PCR lay between 3.16 and 9.51 log10 RNA copies/mL buffer. All false negative patients in the adult ED cohort, who had confirmed symptom onset at least seven days earlier had less than 5 × 105 RNA copies/mL buffer. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the use of AGTEST among symptomatic patients in the emergency setting is useful for the early identification of COVID-19, but patients who test negative require confirmation by PCRTEST and must stay isolated until this result becomes available. Adult patients with a false negative AGTEST and symptom onset at least one week earlier have typically a low SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration and are likely no longer infectious.","Möckel, Martin; Corman, Victor M; Stegemann, Miriam S; Hofmann, Jörg; Stein, Angela; Jones, Terry C; Gastmeier, Petra; Seybold, Joachim; Offermann, Ralf; Bachmann, Ulrike; Lindner, Tobias; Bauer, Wolfgang; Drosten, Christian; Rosen, Alexander; Somasundaram, Rajan",Biomarkers,411,5

Methods: We analyzed electronic medical record data from infants born at less than 32 weeks gestational age (GA) cared for in the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in a COVID-19-affected period (March 8, 2020 to May 31, 2020) and the analogous period in 2019. Our final sample consisted of 52 infants ( n =27, 2019 cohort; n =25, 2020 cohort). Rates of family visitation and of family- and clinical staff-delivered developmental care were compared across cohorts, adjusting for GA at start of study period. Results: Results indicated that families of infants in the 2020 cohort visited less frequently (47% of available days) than those in the 2019 cohort (97%; p =0.001). Infants received developmental care activities less frequently in the 2020 cohort (3.51 vs. 4.72 activities per day; p =0.04), with a lower number of minutes per day (99.91 vs. 145.14; p =0.04) and a shorter duration per instance (23.41 vs. 29.65; p =0.03). Similar reductions occurred in both family- and staff-delivered developmental care activities. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted family visitation and preterm infant developmental care practices in the NICU, both experiences associated with positive health benefits. Hospitals should create programs to improve family visitation and engagement, while also increasing staff-delivered developmental care. Careful attention should be paid to long-term follow up of preterm infants and families.","Scala, Melissa; Marchman, Virginia A; Brignoni-Pérez, Edith; Morales, Maya Chan; Travis, Katherine E",,411,13

Epidemiological research has shown that sex is associated with the severity of COVID-19, but the underlying mechanism of sex predisposition remains poorly understood. We aim to study the gendered differences in inflammation reaction, and the association with severity and mortality of COVID-19. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we enrolled 548 COVID-19 inpatients from Tongji Hospital from 26 January to 5 February 2020, and followed up to 3 March 2020. Epidemiological, demographic and clinical features, and inflammatory indexes were collected and compared between males and females. The Cox proportional hazard regression model was applied to identify the gendered effect on mortality of COVID-19 after adjusting for age, comorbidity, and smoking history. The multiple linear regression method was used to explore the influence of sex on inflammation reaction. RESULTS: Males had higher mortality than females did (22.2% vs 10.4%), with an hazard ratio of 1.923 (95% confidence interval, 1.181-3.130); elder age and comorbidity were significantly associated with decease of COVID-19 patients. Excess inflammation reaction was related to severity of COVID-19. Male patients had greater inflammation reaction, with higher levels of interleukin 10, tumor necrosis factor-&#945;, lactose dehydrogenase, ferritin, and hyper-sensitive C-reactive protein, but a lower lymphocyte count than females adjusted by age and comorbidity. CONCLUSIONS: Sex, age, and comorbidity are critical risk factors for mortality of COVID-19. Excess innate immunity and proinflammation activity, and deficiency in adaptive immunity response promote males, especially elder males, to develop a cytokine storm, causing potential acute respiratory distressed syndrome, multiple organ failure and decease.","Qin, Lu; Li, Xiaochen; Shi, Jing; Yu, Muqing; Wang, Ke; Tao, Yu; Zhou, Ying; Zhou, Min; Xu, Shuyun; Wu, Bo; Yang, Zhenyu; Zhang, Cong; Yue, Junqing; Cheng, Chongsheng; Liu, Xiansheng; Xie, Min",J. med. virol,411,22

A fair and transparent system for assessing the risk of further delaying surgery for individual patients to prioritize surgical scheduling is needed. METHODS: Factors related to risk of delaying surgery for breast patients were identified. Scores were assigned to each factor, with higher scores indicating a greater risk from delaying surgery. REDCap and Microsoft Excel tools were designed to track and score delayed patients. RESULTS: Published data and multidisciplinary clinical judgement were used to assign risk scores based on patient and tumor factors, length of delay, and tumor response to preoperative therapy. Patients completing neoadjuvant chemotherapy were assigned the highest scores as their options for delaying surgery are most limited. Among patients receiving neoadjuvant endocrine therapy or no medical therapy, higher scores were assigned for low-estrogen receptor or high-genomic risk scores, higher grade, larger tumors, younger age and longer delay. High priority scores were assigned for progression during preoperative therapy. Low scores were assigned for re-excisions, atypical lesions and other benign indications. There was good agreement of the tool's ranking of sample patients with rankings by experienced clinicians. The tool generates risk-stratified patient lists by surgeon or institution to facilitate assignment of surgery dates. CONCLUSIONS: This tool generates a clinically consistent, risk-stratified priority list of breast surgical procedures delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic. This systematic approach may facilitate surgical scheduling as conditions normalize.","Smith, Barbara L; Nguyen, Anvy; Korotkin, Jenna E; Kelly, Bridget N; Specht, Michelle C; Spring, Laura M; Moy, Beverly; Isakoff, Steven J; Gadd, Michele A",Breast Cancer Res Treat,411,9

This population-based cohort study sought to identify sociodemographic characteristics and Health Belief Model factors that are associated with nonadherence to COVID-19 mitigation strategies with the goal of informing public health messaging campaigns. METHODS: An online population-based survey was distributed via social media over an 8-week period from April 13, 2020, to June 8, 2020. RESULTS: Data were derived from 2,222 adults (57% female; 40% racial/ethnic minorities). Univariate analyses revealed that men, younger aged (18-30 years) and unmarried adults, and noncollege educated individuals had lower levels of perceived threat, control, and knowledge about COVID-19 (p &#8804; .001). Multivariable linear regression models further revealed that male gender was significantly associated with reporting lower levels of adherence to COVID-19 mitigation strategies (p < .001), and that higher levels of perceived threat, perceived control, and knowledge about how to keep oneself and others safe from COVID-19 were significantly associated with reporting higher levels of adherence to COVID-19 mitigation strategies (p < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that public health appeals that target men, emphasize individual risk, and provide clear, consistent guidance on what individuals can do to decrease their risk for COVID-19 may be effective in motivating increased mitigation adherence.","Badr, Hoda; Oluyomi, Abiodun; Woodard, LeChauncy; Zhang, Xiaotao; Raza, Syed Ahsan; Adel Fahmideh, Maral; El-Mubasher, Ola; Amos, Christopher A",Ann. behav. med,411,16

As some AgPOCTs have become available, interest is growing in their utility and performance. Here we aimed to compare the analytical sensitivity and specificity of seven commercially available AgPOCT devices. Methods: In a single-centre, laboratory evaluation study, we compared AgPOCT products from seven suppliers: the Abbott Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test, the RapiGEN BIOCREDIT COVID-19 Ag, the Healgen Coronavirus Ag Rapid Test Cassette (Swab), the Coris BioConcept COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip, the R-Biopharm RIDA QUICK SARS-CoV-2 Antigen, the nal von minden NADAL COVID-19 Ag Test, and the Roche-SD Biosensor SARS-CoV Rapid Antigen Test. Tests were evaluated on recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein, cultured endemic and emerging coronaviruses, stored respiratory samples with known SARS-CoV-2 viral loads, stored samples from patients with respiratory pathogens other than SARS-CoV-2, and self-sampled swabs from healthy volunteers. We estimated analytical sensitivity in terms of approximate viral concentrations (quantified by real-time RT-PCR) that yielded positive AgPOCT results, and specificity in terms of propensity to generate false-positive results. Findings: In 138 clinical samples with quantified SARS-CoV-2 viral load, the 95% limit of detection (concentration at which 95% of test results were positive) in six of seven AgPOCT products ranged between 2·07 × 106 and 2·86 × 107 copies per swab, with an outlier (RapiGEN) at 1·57 × 1010 copies per swab. The assays showed no cross-reactivity towards cell culture or tissue culture supernatants containing any of the four endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV­229E, HCoV­NL63, HCoV­OC43, or HCoV­HKU1) or MERS-CoV, with the exception of the Healgen assay in one repeat test on HCoV-HKU1 supernatant. SARS-CoV was cross-detected by all assays. Cumulative specificities among stored clinical samples with non-SARS-CoV-2 infections (n=100) and self-samples from healthy volunteers (n=35; cumulative sample n=135) ranged between 98·5% (95% CI 94·2-99·7) and 100·0% (97·2-100·0) in five products, with two outliers at 94·8% (89·2-97·7; R-Biopharm) and 88·9% (82·1-93·4; Healgen). False-positive results did not appear to be associated with any specific respiratory pathogen. Interpretation: The sensitivity range of most AgPOCTs overlaps with SARS-CoV-2 viral loads typically observed in the first week of symptoms, which marks the infectious period in most patients. The AgPOCTs with limit of detections that approximate virus concentrations at which patients are infectious might enable shortcuts in decision making in various areas of health care and public health.

Creative solutions have emerged amongst some recent commercial and hobbyists' projects, yet most either are closed-source or lack validation in performance. We develop FaceOff---a sensing technique using a commodity wrist-worn accelerometer to detect face-touching behavior based on the specific motion pattern of raising one's hand towards the face. We report a survey (N=20) that elicits different ways people touch their faces, an algorithm that temporally ensembles data-driven models to recognize when a face touching behavior occurs and results from a preliminary user testing (N=3 for a total of about 90 minutes).","Chen, Xiang 'Anthony'",,411,23

In blood, the ferroxidase ceruloplasmin (CP) accounts for the majority of circulating Cu and serves as transport protein. Both Cu and CP behave as positive, whereas serum selenium (Se) and its transporter selenoprotein P (SELENOP) behave as negative acute phase reactants. In view that coronavirus disease (COVID-19) causes systemic inflammation, we hypothesized that biomarkers of Cu and Se status are regulated inversely, in relation to disease severity and mortality risk. Serum samples from COVID-19 patients were analysed for Cu by total reflection X-ray fluorescence and CP was quantified by a validated sandwich ELISA. The two Cu biomarkers correlated positively in serum from patients with COVID-19 (R = 0.42, p < 0.001). Surviving patients showed higher mean serum Cu and CP concentrations in comparison to non-survivors ([mean+/-SEM], Cu; 1475.9+/-22.7 vs. 1317.9+/-43.9 µg/L; p < 0.001, CP; 547.2.5 +/- 19.5 vs. 438.8+/-32.9 mg/L, p = 0.086). In contrast to expectations, total serum Cu and Se concentrations displayed a positive linear correlation in the patient samples analysed (R = 0.23, p = 0.003). Serum CP and SELENOP levels were not interrelated. Applying receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis, the combination of Cu and SELENOP with age outperformed other combinations of parameters for predicting risk of death, yielding an AUC of 95.0%. We conclude that the alterations in serum biomarkers of Cu and Se status in COVID-19 are not compatible with a simple acute phase response, and that serum Cu and SELENOP levels contribute to a good prediction of survival. Adjuvant supplementation in patients with diagnostically proven deficits in Cu or Se may positively influence disease course, as both increase in survivors and are of crucial importance for the immune response and antioxidative defence systems.","Hackler, Julian; Heller, Raban Arved; Sun, Qian; Schwarzer, Marco; Diegmann, Joachim; Bachmann, Manuel; Moghaddam, Arash; Schomburg, Lutz",Nutrients,411,24

DESIGN: Perspective METHODS: Review of studies focused on digital device usage, near work, and outdoor time in relation to myopia onset and progression. Public health policies on myopia control, recommendations on screen time and information pertaining to the impact of COVID-19 on increased digital device use were presented. Recommendations to minimize the impact of the pandemic on myopia onset and progression in children were made. RESULTS: Increased digital screen time, near work and limited outdoor activities were found to be associated with the onset and progression of myopia, and could potentially be aggravated during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak period. While school closures may be short-lived, increased access, adoption and dependence on digital devices could have a long term negative impact on childhood development. Raising awareness among parents, children and government agencies is key to mitigating myopigenic behaviours that may become entrenched during this period. CONCLUSIONS: While it is important to adopt critical measures to slow or halt the spread of COVID-19, close collaboration between parents, schools and ministries is necessary to assess and mitigate the long term collateral impact of COVID-19 on myopia control policies.","Wong, Chee Wai; Tsai, Andrew; Jonas, Jost B; Ohno-Matsui, Kyoko; Chen, James; Ang, Marcus; Ting, Daniel Shu Wei",Am. j. ophthalmol,411,10

RESULTS: Of patients included in this study, the median age was 41 years (18-90). The mean hospital stay was 1 day (1-12), and the mean duration of operation was 25 min (3-250). Thirty-seven patients (69.8%) underwent general anesthesia, while only 11(20.8%) underwent combined spinal epidural anesthesia. Four patients (7.5%) required local and only one patient (1.9%) underwent sedo-analgesia. Complications were encountered in six patients (11.4%), urosepsis in two, pneumonia in one, and urinary tract infection in three patients. Compared to last year's numbers, the number of patients admitted to the hospital's outpatient clinic and that of hospitalized patients decreased by 47.2% and 49.1%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Emergent surgeries in urological practices can be performed safely under routine preoperative testing for COVID-19 and with the use of adequate protective equipment for both the surgical team and the patient.","Cakiroglu, Basri; Kaya, Cevdet; Kilic, Hasan Huseyin; Aksoy, Suleyman Hilmi; Gözüküçük, Ramazan",Urologia,411,16

The COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) initiative's campaign involves a proportional framework to finance and distribute SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in low- and middle-income countries. However, the COVAX framework has critical limitations, including limited funding and the failure to account for the special epidemic risks and needs of its participating nations, as recommended by the World Health Organization's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization framework. These drawbacks disproportionately impact Africa, where many nations rely on COVAX as their main source of vaccines. The current plan to vaccinate only up to 20% of participating nations' populations is short-sighted from both epidemiologic and moral perspectives. COVAX must commit to vaccinating all of Africa and its initiative must be modified to account for the health and economic infrastructures in these countries. Lessons learned from successful vaccination campaigns, including the West African Ebola outbreak, have shown that vaccinating all of Africa is possible and feasible, and that infrastructure and human resources can support mass vaccination. To halt this global pandemic, global responsibility must be accepted to finance and equitably distribute SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to African nations. We urge COVAX to act swiftly to prevent Africa from becoming the new face of a persisting pandemic.","Rogers, Abu Bakarr; Barrie, Mohamed Bailor; Fallah, Mosoka P; Kelly, J Daniel",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,411,9

We aimed to provide substantial evidence for the effect of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine versus native infection on maternal humoral, as well as transplacentally acquired fetal immune response, potentially providing newborn protection.METHODSA multicenter study where parturients presenting for delivery were recruited at 8 medical centers across Israel and assigned to 3 study groups: vaccinated (n = 86); PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected during pregnancy (n = 65), and unvaccinated noninfected controls (n = 62). Maternal and fetal blood samples were collected from parturients prior to delivery and from the umbilical cord following delivery, respectively. Sera IgG and IgM titers were measured using the Milliplex MAP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Panel (for S1, S2, RBD, and N).RESULTSThe BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine elicits strong maternal humoral IgG response (anti-S and RBD) that crosses the placenta barrier and approaches maternal titers in the fetus within 15 days following the first dose. Maternal to neonatal anti-COVID-19 antibodies ratio did not differ when comparing sensitization (vaccine vs. infection). IgG transfer ratio at birth was significantly lower for third-trimester as compared with second trimester infection. Lastly, fetal IgM response was detected in 5 neonates, all in the infected group.CONCLUSIONAntenatal BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination induces a robust maternal humoral response that effectively transfers to the fetus, supporting the role of vaccination during pregnancy.FUNDINGIsrael Science Foundation and the Weizmann Institute Fondazione Henry Krenter.","Beharier, Ofer; Plitman Mayo, Romina; Raz, Tal; Nahum Sacks, Kira; Schreiber, Letizia; Suissa-Cohen, Yael; Chen, Rony; Gomez-Tolub, Rachel; Hadar, Eran; Gabbay-Benziv, Rinat; Jaffe Moshkovich, Yuval; Biron-Shental, Tal; Shechter-Maor, Gil; Farladansky-Gershnabel, Sivan; Yitzhak Sela, Hen; Benyamini-Raischer, Hedi; Sela, Nitzan D; Goldman-Wohl, Debra; Shulman, Ziv; Many, Ariel; Barr, Haim; Yagel, Simcha; Neeman, Michal; Kovo, Michal",J. clin. invest,411,20

The spike glycoprotein on the surface of coronavirus mediates its entry into host cells and is the target of all current antibody design efforts to neutralize the virus. The glycan shield of the spike helps the virus to evade the human immune response by providing a thick sugar-coated barrier against any antibody. To study the dynamic motion of glycans in the spike protein, we performed microsecond-long molecular dynamics simulation in two different states that correspond to the receptor binding domain in open or closed conformations. Analysis of this microsecond-long simulation revealed a scissoring motion on the N-terminal domain of neighboring monomers in the spike trimer. The roles of multiple glycans in shielding of spike protein in different regions were uncovered by a network analysis, in which the high betweenness centrality of glycans at the apex revealed their importance and function in the glycan shield. Microdomains of glycans were identified featuring a high degree of intracommunication in these microdomains. An antibody overlap analysis revealed the glycan microdomains as well as individual glycans that inhibit access to the antibody epitopes on the spike protein. Overall, the results of this study provide detailed understanding of the spike glycan shield, which may be utilized for therapeutic efforts against this crisis.","Ghorbani, Mahdi; Brooks, Bernard R; Klauda, Jeffery B",Biophys. j,411,5

Methods This was a multicenter cross-sectional study that took place over a period of 3 months (June to August 2020) inendoscopy centers in Burkina Faso, Benin and Niger. An online survey was sent to patients who had performed upper andlower digestive endoscopies, in 8 endoscopy centers including private, public and confessional health centers. The survey were either sent electronically or completed in the endoscopy room with the help of field investigators, according topatients' preferences. The choice of centers was randomly made from the list of centers. Results A total of 294 patients answered to the online survey. There were 37 lower endoscopies and 257 upperendoscopies. Most of the patients came from confessional health centers (147 or 50 %). The wait times for obtaining anendoscopy appointment were 48 hours for 111 patients (37.8 %) and 72 hours for 70 patients 23.8 %.One hundred andeight patients or 36.7 % noted the absence of a sorting center in the health centers. In the endoscopy departments, 112patients (38.1 %), were questioned about the risk factors for contamination to SARS-CoV-2. Among the risk factors found, 6patients (2 %) traveled abroad in the 2 weeks preceding the examination, 4 patients 1.4 % had already been in contact witha subject at risk.The most frequent symptoms were abdominal pain (162 patients;55.1 %) and nausea (48 patients;16.3 %). The indications for the examinations were dominated by abdominal pain (156 patients;53.1 %).Twenty-two patients(7.4 %) felt highly exposed to COVID-19 during the endoscopy examination. Conclusions The risk associated with infection in SARS-CoV-2 does not seem to have been sufficiently taken into accountin endoscopy centers in the afore mentioned 3 countries.","Guingane, N.

The disruption of sodium homeostasis, tends to be a common occurrence in patients with COVID-19. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 1,254 COVID-19 patients comprising 124 (9.9%) hyponatremic patients (under 135 mmol/L) and 30 (2.4%) hypernatremic patients (over 145 mmol/L) from three hospitals in Hubei, China, were enrolled in the study. The relationships between sodium balance disorders in COVID-19 patients, its clinical features, implications, and the underlying causes were presented. Hyponatremia patients were observed to be elderly, had more comorbidities, with severe pneumonic chest radiographic findings. They were also more likely to have a fever, nausea, higher leukocyte and neutrophils count, and a high sensitivity C-reactive protein (HS-CRP). Compared to normonatremia patients, renal insufficiency was common in both hyponatremia and hypernatremia patients. In addition, hyponatremia patients required extensive treatment with oxygen, antibiotics, and corticosteroids. The only significant differences between the hypernatremia and normonatremia patients were laboratory findings and clinical complications, and patients with hypernatremia were more likely to use traditional Chinese medicine for treatment compared to normonatremia patients. This study indicates that severity of the disease, the length of stay in the hospital of surviving patients, and mortality were higher among COVID-19 patients with sodium balance disorders. CONCLUSION: Sodium balance disorder, particularly hyponatremia, is a common condition among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Hubei, China, and it is associated with a higher risk of severe illness and increased in-hospital mortality.","Hu, Weihua; Lv, Xinke; Li, Chang; Xu, Yang; Qi, Yiding; Zhang, Zhuheng; Li, Mingxuan; Cai, Feina; Liu, Dan; Yue, Jiang; Ye, Maoqing; Chen, Qijian; Shi, Kailei",Intern. emerg. med,411,16

S protein mediates the SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cells. The ""fusion core"" of the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) on S plays a crucial role in the virus infectivity, as it is part of a key membrane fusion architecture. While SARS-CoV-2 was becoming a global threat, scientists have been accumulating data on the virus at an impressive pace, both in terms of genomic sequences and of three-dimensional structures. On 15 February 2021, from the SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences in the GISAID resource, we collected 415,673 complete S protein sequences and identified all the mutations occurring in the HR1 fusion core. This is a 21-residue segment, which, in the post-fusion conformation of the protein, gives many strong interactions with the heptad repeat 2, bringing viral and cellular membranes in proximity for fusion. We investigated the frequency and structural effect of novel mutations accumulated over time in such a crucial region for the virus infectivity. Three mutations were quite frequent, occurring in over 0.1% of the total sequences. These were S929T, D936Y, and S949F, all in the N-terminal half of the HR1 fusion core segment and particularly spread in Europe and USA. The most frequent of them, D936Y, was present in 17% of sequences from Finland and 12% of sequences from Sweden. In the post-fusion conformation of the unmutated S protein, D936 is involved in an inter-monomer salt bridge with R1185. We investigated the effect of the D936Y mutation on the pre-fusion and post-fusion state of the protein by using molecular dynamics, showing how it especially affects the latter one.","Oliva, Romina; Shaikh, Abdul Rajjak; Petta, Andrea; Vangone, Anna; Cavallo, Luigi",Molecules (Basel),411,20

While education must promote the skills people need to critically question the sourcing of online information, it is important, more generally, to understand how to successfully promote the acquisition of any skills related to seeking online information. This review outlines technologies that aim to support users when they collaboratively seek online information. Upon integrating psychological–pedagogical approaches on trust in and the sourcing of online information, argumentation, and computer-supported collaborative learning, we reviewed the literature (N = 95 journal articles) on technologies for collaborative online information seeking. The technologies we identified either addressed collaborative online information seeking as an exclusive process for searching for online information or, alternatively, addressed online information seeking within the context of a more complex learning process. Our review was driven by three main research questions: We aimed to understand whether and how the studies considered 1) the role of trust and critical questioning in the sourcing of online information, 2) the learning processes at play when information seekers engage in collaborative argumentation, and 3) what affordances are offered by technologies that support users’ collaborative seeking of online information. The reviewed articles that focused exclusively on technologies for seeking online information primarily addressed aspects of cooperation (e.g., task management), whereas articles that focused on technologies for integrating the processes of information seeking into the entire learning processes instead highlighted aspects of collaborative argumentation (e.g., exchange of multiple perspectives and critical questioning in argumentation). Seven of the articles referred to trust as an aspect of seekers’ sourcing strategies. We emphasize how researchers’, users’, and technology developers’ consideration of collaborative argumentation could expand the benefits of technological support for seeking online information.","Mayweg-Paus, Elisabeth; Zimmermann, Maria; Le, Nguyen-Thinh; Pinkwart, Niels",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),411,1

To study the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV infection and development of medical countermeasures (MCMs) for MERS, a number of genetically modified mouse models have been developed, including various versions of transgenic mice expressing the human DPP4 viral receptor. Tracking and quantifying viral infection, among others, in permissive hosts is a key endpoint for studying MERS pathogenesis and evaluating the efficacy of selected MCMs developed for MERS. In addition to quantifying infectious progeny virus which requires high-containment biosafety level (BSL)-3 laboratory, here we outlined an established real-time quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR)-based procedure to unequivocally quantify MERS-CoV-specific RNAs within the lungs of infected human DPP4 (hDPP4, transgenic (hDPP4 Tg) mice under a standard BSL-2 laboratory.","Algaissi, Abdullah; Agrawal, Anurodh S.; Hashem, Anwar M.; Tseng, Chien-Te K.",MERS Coronavirus,411,26

The needs of patients with chronic diseases tend to be overlooked during the pandemic. With reduced opportunities for routine clinic visits, these patients are adopting various telehealth services such as video consultation and remote monitoring. We advocate for more innovative designs to be considered to enhance patients’ feelings of “copresence”—a sense of connection with another interactant via digital technology—with their health care providers during this time. The copresence-enhanced design has been shown to reduce patients’ anxiety and increase their confidence in managing their chronic disease condition. It has the potential to reduce the patient’s need to reach out to their health care provider during a time when health care resources are being stretched.","Liu, Na; Huang, Robin; Baldacchino, Tanya; Sud, Archana; Sud, Kamal; Khadra, Mohamed; Kim, Jinman",J Med Internet Res,411,20

Instructors’ acceptance of online teaching plays a crucial role, as the acceptance level can impact instructors’ online teaching behaviors. This qualitative study examined medicine and public health instructors’ perceptions of online teaching using the Technology Acceptance Model 2 (TAM2) model. Through semi-structured interviews with ten instructors in a Midwest university in the U.S., this study found that instructors had a high level of acceptance of online teaching. Instructors perceived the usefulness of online teaching in terms of learning objectives, assessment, instructional methods, and learning experience. Online teaching was perceived as useful overall, although challenges existed, such as online interaction, assessment, and hands-on practices. Regarding ease of use in online teaching, instructors perceived technology was easy to use; yet some pedagogical challenges existed, such as class engagement, the focus of learners’ attention, and transforming hands-on lab or clinical sessions online.

We hypothesized that responses would differ by gender and minorities underrepresented in medicine (URiM) status. METHODS: An electronic survey was sent to 1,531 SSR members between January 2020 and March 2020 to determine perception of equity and respect. Descriptive statistics were calculated, and analysis of differences in response by gender/minority status was performed using the Fisher’s exact test. The study was exempt from IRB approval. RESULTS: There were 176 responses (11.5%). Most respondents (61.9%) were between 30 and 50 years. Members identified as male (M) in 74.4%, as female (F) in 25.0%, and as “other” in 0.6%. URiM comprised 9.1% of members. Women worked more commonly in academia (p = 0.005), had the perception of unequal opportunities for leadership positions within the institution (p = 0.006), and emphasized the importance of having a mentor of the same gender (p = 0.001). URiM members were less likely to hold a leadership position (p = 0.1, trend), had a perception of unequal opportunities for leadership positions within the institution (p = 0.06, trend), and reported the importance of having a mentor of the same race (p = 0.06, trend). There were no significant differences between gender or URiM status and perception of the SSR to provide an inclusive environment and leadership opportunities (p ≥ 0.39). CONCLUSION: While survey participation was limited and potentially biased, respondents perceived that women and minorities have fewer opportunities and are treated with lower regard in the workplace compared to male, non-minority colleagues.

The trade-off between pool size and test sensitivity is stated explicitly. The procedure was designed to ensure that samples that would be detectable in individual testing remain detectable in pool testing. The proposed relaxation in cut-off is dependent on the pool size, allowing a relatively tight correction to avoid loss of detection of positive samples. The methodology was evaluated in a study of pool testing of adults attending a public emergency care unit, reference for COVID-19 in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, and presenting flu-like symptoms. Even samples on the edge of detectability in individual testing were detected correctly. The proposed procedure enhances the consistency of RT-qPCR pool testing by enforcing that the scales of detectability in pool processing and in individual sample processing are compatible.

However, their side effects directed clinical tests towards optimizing safe utilization strategies. The noble metal nanoparticles (NP) are promising materials with antiviral and antibacterial properties that can deliver the drug to the target agent, thereby reducing the side effects. In this work, we applied both the quantum mechanical and classical atomistic molecular dynamics approaches to demonstrate the adsorption properties of HCQ/CQ on Ag, Au, AgAu, and Pt nanoparticles. We found the adsorption energies of HCQ/CQ towards nanoparticles have the following trend: PtNP > AuNP > AuAgNP > AgNP. This shows that PtNP has the highest affinity in comparison to the other types of nanoparticles.

Neurosurgical recommendations are to postpone the endoscopic endonasal pituitary surgeries during the pandemic. We would like to express our experience with urgent pituitary adenomas during the current COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In our country, COVID-19 has started to become a paramount problem by March 2020. Nine cases of pituitary adenomas have presented with urgent manifestations. The endoscopic endonasal approach was performed in eight patients, while a craniotomy was selected for a recurrent pituitary adenoma. Pre- and postoperative thorough clinical evaluations with chest CT scans were performed. Other strict infection control measures have been applied. RESULTS: In 8 weeks duration starting from the past days of February 2020, we have operated on four females and five males of pituitary adenomas. Visual deterioration was the main presenting symptom. The driving factor for surgery was saving vision in eight patients. Fortunately, the postoperative course was uneventful for all patients. No suspected COVID-19 infection has been reported in any patient or health-care team except one patient. In our city, PCR test was routinely not available. CONCLUSION: In the era of COVID-19, strict infection control precautions should be employed to limit the possibility of transmission of any possible infection to patient or any of the surgical team. We believe that the risk of getting such infection is not increased by the endonasal approach. Long-term follow-up and large numbers of prospective studies are recommended to delineate the impact of COVID-19 infection on pituitary surgeries.","Arnaout, Mohamed M.; Bessar, Ahmed A.; Elnashar, Ismail; Abaza, Hassan; Makia, Mansour",Surg Neurol Int,411,16

Two separate control groups matched by age, gender and educational level completed the two IAT sessions, separated by same number of days, without being involved in the training program. Results showed that participants who were involved in the training program reduced their implicit bias toward illness measured through IAT in the second session. This reduction in IAT measures was not observed in the control samples, despite the two IAT measures being matched in temporal delay with the experimental group. These findings suggest that an interventional program based on the performing arts could be effective in reducing levels of implicit biases among the general population.","García-Arch, Josué; Ventura-Gabarró, Cèlia; Adamuz, Pedro Lorente; Calvo, Pep Gatell; Fuentemilla, Lluís",Front Psychol,411,33

Conventional treatments against the disease are designed to target viral proteins. However, the emergence of viral variants carrying drug-resistant mutations can outpace the development of pathogen-targeting antivirals. Diphyllin and bafilomycin are potent vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) inhibitors previously shown to have broad-spectrum antiviral activity. However, their poor water solubility and potential off-target effect limit their clinical application. METHODS: In this study, we report that nanoparticle encapsulation of diphyllin and bafilomycin improves the drugs’ anti-influenza applicability. RESULTS: Using PEG-PLGA diblock copolymers, sub-200 nm diphyllin and bafilomycin nanoparticles were prepared, with encapsulation efficiency of 42% and 100%, respectively. The drug-loaded nanoparticles have sustained drug release kinetics beyond 72 hours and facilitate intracellular drug delivery to two different influenza virus-permissive cell lines. As compared to free drugs, the nanoparticulate V-ATPase inhibitors exhibited lower cytotoxicity and greater in vitro antiviral activity, improving the therapeutic index of diphyllin and bafilomycin by approximately 3 and 5-fold, respectively. In a mouse model of sublethal influenza challenge, treatment with diphyllin nanoparticles resulted in reduced body weight loss and viral titer in the lungs. In addition, following a lethal influenza viral challenge, diphyllin nanoparticle treatment conferred a survival advantage of 33%. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the potential of the nanoparticulate V-ATPase inhibitors for host-targeted treatment against influenza.","Hu, Che-Ming Jack; Chen, You-Ting; Fang, Zih-Syun; Chang, Wei-Shan; Chen, Hui-Wen",Int J Nanomedicine,411,20

Survey-based olfactory evaluation tends to underestimate the prevalence of OD, while psychophysical olfactory testing during a pandemic has the disadvantage of being time consuming, expensive, and requiring standardized laboratory settings. We aimed to develop a quick, simple, affordable, and reliable test to objectively assess the prevalence and diagnostic accuracy of OD in COVID-19. The olfactory function of 64 COVID-19 inpatients and 34 controls was evaluated using a questionnaire and a simple disposable odor identification test (SDOIT) developed for this study. Four SDOIT models were assessed: 10-SDOIT, 9-SDOIT, 8-SDOIT, and 4-SDOIT, with 10, 9, 8 and 4 samples, respectively. We found a high frequency of self-reported OD in COVID-19 patients, with 32.8% and 42.2% reporting current and recent OD, respectively. Different SDOIT models revealed smell impairment in 54.7–64.1% of COVID-19 patients. The combination of either 10-SDOIT results and self-reported OD, or 8-SDOIT results and self-reported OD, were the best predictors of COVID-19, both with an AUC value of 0.87 (0.85 and 0.86 for the age-matched subjects). OD is a common symptom of COVID-19. A combination of self-reported smell deterioration and OD psychophysically evaluated using SDOIT appears to be a good predictor of COVID-19.","Ziuzia-Januszewska, Laura; Dobrzyński, Paweł; Ślączka, Krzysztof; Ciszek, Jaromir; Krawiec, Łukasz; Wierzba, Waldemar; Zaczyński, Artur",Int J Environ Res Public Health,411,17

Using sensitive sequence profile analysis methods, we characterize a novel superfamily (the SUKH superfamily) that unites a diverse group of proteins including Smi1/Knr4, PGs2, FBXO3, SKIP16, Syd, herpesviral US22, IRS1 and TRS1, and their bacterial homologs. Using contextual analysis we present evidence that the bacterial members of this superfamily are potential immunity proteins for a variety of toxin systems that also include the recently characterized contact-dependent inhibition (CDI) systems of proteobacteria. By analyzing the toxin proteins encoded in the neighborhood of the SUKH superfamily we predict that they possess domains belonging to diverse nuclease and nucleic acid deaminase families. These include at least eight distinct types of DNases belonging to HNH/EndoVII- and restriction endonuclease-fold, and RNases of the EndoU-like and colicin E3-like cytotoxic RNases-folds. The N-terminal domains of these toxins indicate that they are extruded by several distinct secretory mechanisms such as the two-partner system (shared with the CDI systems) in proteobacteria, ESAT-6/WXG-like ATP-dependent secretory systems in Gram-positive bacteria and the conventional Sec-dependent system in several bacterial lineages. The hedgehog-intein domain might also release a subset of toxic nuclease domains through auto-proteolytic action. Unlike classical colicin-like nuclease toxins, the overwhelming majority of toxin systems with the SUKH superfamily is chromosomally encoded and appears to have diversified through a recombination process combining different C-terminal nuclease domains to N-terminal secretion-related domains. Across the bacterial superkingdom these systems might participate in discriminating `self’ or kin from `non-self’ or non-kin strains. Using structural analysis we demonstrate that the SUKH domain possesses a versatile scaffold that can be used to bind a wide range of protein partners. In eukaryotes it appears to have been recruited as an adaptor to regulate modification of proteins by ubiquitination or polyglutamylation. Similarly, another widespread immunity protein from these toxin systems, namely the suppressor of fused (SuFu) superfamily has been recruited for comparable roles in eukaryotes. In animal DNA viruses, such as herpesviruses, poxviruses, iridoviruses and adenoviruses, the ability of the SUKH domain to bind diverse targets has been deployed to counter diverse anti-viral responses by interacting with specific host proteins.","Zhang, Dapeng; Iyer, Lakshminarayan M.; Aravind, L.",Nucleic Acids Res,411,5

To date, the disease has infected more than 18 million people with over 690k deaths reported. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the current gold standard for clinical diagnosis but may produce false positives; thus, chest CT based diagnosis is considered more viable. However, accurate screening is challenging due to the difficulty in annotation of infected areas, curation of large datasets, and the slight discrepancies between COVID-19 and other viral pneumonia. In this study, we propose an attention-based end-to-end weakly supervised framework for the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 and bacterial pneumonia based on multiple instance learning (MIL). We further incorporate unsupervised contrastive learning for improved accuracy with attention applied both in spatial and latent contexts, herein we propose Dual Attention Contrastive based MIL (DA-CMIL). DA-CMIL takes as input several patient CT slices (considered as bag of instances) and outputs a single label. Attention based pooling is applied to implicitly select key slices in the latent space, whereas spatial attention learns slice spatial context for interpretable diagnosis. A contrastive loss is applied at the instance level to encode similarity of features from the same patient against representative pooled patient features. Empirical results show that our algorithm achieves an overall accuracy of 98.6% and an AUC of 98.4%. Moreover, ablation studies show the benefit of contrastive learning with MIL.","Chikontwe, Philip; Luna, Miguel; Kang, Myeongkyun; Hong, Kyung Soo; Ahn, June Hong; Park, Sang Hyun",Med Image Anal,411,26

A photochemical treatment (PCT) process with amotosalen‐HCl and long‐wavelength ultraviolet light (UVA), which cross‐links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate viruses and other pathogens in PLT concentrates. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: High titers of pathogenic or blood‐borne viruses, representing 10 different families, were added to single‐donor PLT concentrates containing 3.0 × 10(11) to 6.0 × 10(11) PLTs in approximately 300 mL of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent PLT additive solution (InterSol). After PCT with 150 µmol per L amotosalen and 3 J per cm(2) UVA, residual viral infectivity was assayed by sensitive cell culture or animal systems. RESULTS: Enveloped viruses were uniformly sensitive to inactivation by PCT whereas nonenveloped viruses demonstrated variable inactivation.

It remains unknown whether atypical N-glycosylation of SGP modulates SARS-CoV-2 tropism for infections. Here, we address this question through an extensive bioinformatics analysis of publicly available structural and genetic data. We identified two atypical sequons (sequences of N-glycosylation: NGV 481-483 and NGV 501-503), strategically located on the receptor-binding motif (RBM) of SGP and facing the hACE2 receptor. Interestingly, the cryo-electron microscopy structure of trimeric SGP in complex with potent-neutralizing antibodies from convalescent patients revealed covalently-linked N-glycans in NGV 481-483 atypical sequons. Furthermore, NGV 501-503 atypical sequon involves the asparagine-501 residue, whose highly-transmissible mutation N501Y is present in circulating variants of major concerns and affects the SGP-hACE2 binding-interface through the well-known hotspot-353.

RESULTS: The overall mean score for well-being was 42.4, indicating that 51.9% of adults suffered from poor mental health. And within that 48% of males and 57% of females were depressed. The mean scores for government workers, unemployed workers, and business employees were 45.1, 39.6, and 39.5, respectively.

Stay-at-home orders had significant repercussions on mental health and created a gender disparity in depression among adults. Suggestions include promoting mental health for women, unemployed, and business individuals. Married women need to be taken into special consideration as their mental well-being is worse. Older people (50 years of age and over) reported a high day-to-day variation in their mental health.

Boars, as an important disseminator, shed PPV to sows via semen. PPV infects and numerously replicates in boar testicle, which results in damage of swine testicle in vivo. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), a mediator of cell apoptosis, play a crucial role in the mitochondria apoptotic pathway. However, whether PPV infection induces ST cells apoptosis and ROS accumulation is still unclear. METHODS: To determine the effects of PPV infection on the apoptosis, we detected morphological changes, DNA ladder, activities of caspases, and expression of PARP in PPV-infected ST cells. Moreover, aiming to investigate the effect of PPV infection on the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and ROS accumulation, we detected the Δψm, apoptosis-related genes, and ROS. To investigate the role of ROS in the process of PPV-induced apoptosis, the ST cells were infected with PPV and treated with the ROS antioxidants. The ROS level was measured using Reactive Oxygen Species Assay Kit and the Δψm, expression level of Bcl-2, translocation of Bax, and redistribution of mitochondria cytochrome c were tested. RESULTS: In this study, we demonstrated that PPV infection could induce apoptosis that was characterized by morphological changes, DNA fragmentation and activation of caspases. Moreover, PPV infection suppressed Bcl-2 expression, enhanced Bax expression and translocation to mitochondria, decreased the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and triggered the release of cytochrome c, which caused the subsequent activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 and initiation of apoptosis. However, during the process of PPV-induced apoptosis, the protein levels of Fas and FasL were not affected. Further studies showed that PPV infection caused ROS accumulation. Inhibition of ROS could reduce mitochondrial transmembrane potential and could significantly block ST cells apoptosis via suppressing Bax translocation, cytochrome c and caspase-3 activation. CONCLUSIONS: All these results suggest that PPV-induced ROS accumulation mediates apoptosis in ST cells, which provided theoretical basis for the molecular pathogenesis of PPV infection.","Zhao, Xiaomin; Xiang, Hailing; Bai, Xiaoyuan; Fei, Naijiao; Huang, Yong; Song, Xiangjun; Zhang, Hongling; Zhang, Liang; Tong, Dewen",Virol J,411,1

METHODS: Retrospective, observational, consecutive case series of patients admitted with ICH to Maimonides Medical Center from March 1 through July 31, 2020, who had confirmed or highly suspected COVID-19. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, imaging, and outcome data were analyzed. ICH rates among all strokes were compared to the same time period in 2019 in two-week time intervals. Correlation of systolic blood pressure variability (SBPV) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) to clinical outcomes were performed. RESULTS: Of 324 patients who presented with stroke, 65 (20%) were diagnosed with non-traumatic ICH: 8 had confirmed and 3 had highly suspected COVID-19. Nine (82%) had at least one associated risk factor for ICH. Three ICHs occurred during inpatient anticoagulation. More than half (6) suffered either deep or cerebellar hemorrhages; only 2 were lobar hemorrhages. Two of 8 patients with severe pneumonia survived. During the NYC COVID-19 peak period in April, ICH comprised the highest percentage of all strokes (40%), and then steadily decreased week-after-week (p = 0.02).

Pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs) are rare, multi-functional epithelial cells currently garnering attention as intrapulmonary sensors; PNECs can detect hypoxic conditions through chemoreception. Because PNEC overactivation has been reported in patients suffering from respiratory diseases – such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and other congenital diseases – an improved understanding of the fundamental characteristics of PNECs is becoming crucial in pulmonary biology and pathology. During the past decade, murine genetics and disease models revealed the involvement of PNECs in lung ventilation dynamics, mechanosensing and the type 2 immune responses. Single-cell RNA sequencing further unveiled heterogeneous gene expression profiles in the PNEC population and revealed that a small number of PNECs undergo reprogramming during regeneration. Aberrant large clusters of PNECs have been observed in neuroendocrine tumors, including small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Modern innovation of imaging analyses has enabled the discovery of dynamic migratory behaviors of PNECs during airway development, perhaps relating to SCLC malignancy. This Review summarizes the findings from research on PNECs, along with novel knowledge about their function.

People observed for at least 365 days before 1 January 2017, 2018, or 2019 were included. We based study outcomes on lists published by regulators: acute myocardial infarction, anaphylaxis, appendicitis, Bell’s palsy, deep vein thrombosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, encephalomyelitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic stroke, immune thrombocytopenia, myocarditis/pericarditis, narcolepsy, pulmonary embolism, and transverse myelitis. We calculated incidence rates stratified by age, sex, and database. We pooled rates across databases using random effects meta-analyses. We classified meta-analytic estimates into Council of International Organizations of Medical Sciences categories: very common, common, uncommon, rare, or very rare. FINDINGS: We analysed 126,661,070 people. Rates varied greatly between databases and by age and sex. Some AESI (e.g., myocardial infarction, Guillain-Barre syndrome) increased with age, while others (e.g., anaphylaxis, appendicitis) were more common in young people. As a result, AESI were classified differently according to age. For example, myocardial infarction was very rare in children, rare in women aged 35-54 years, uncommon in men and women aged 55-84 years, and common in those aged ≥85 years.

Thiocyanate can outcompete chlorine anions and other halides (F(−), Br(−), I(−)) as substrates for myeloperoxidase by undergoing two-electron oxidation with hydrogen peroxide. This forms their respective hypohalous acids (HOX where X(−) = halides) and in the case of thiocyanate, hypothiocyanous acid (HOSCN), which is also a bactericidal oxidative species involved in the regulation of commensal and pathogenic microflora. Disease may dysregulate redox processes and cause imbalances in the oxidative profile, where typically favoured oxidative species, such as hypochlorous acid (HOCl), result in an overabundance of chlorinated protein residues. As such, the pharmacological capacity of thiocyanate has been recently investigated for its ability to modulate myeloperoxidase activity for HOSCN, a less potent species relative to HOCl, although outcomes vary significantly across different disease models.

National and local governments have requested that residents refrain from traveling between prefectures during the state of emergency. However, the extent to which restricting interregional mobility prevents infection expansion is unclear. The spatial SEIR model describes the spatial spread pattern of COVID-19 infection when people commute or travel to a prefecture in the daytime and return to their residential prefecture at night. It is assumed that people are exposed to an infection risk during their daytime activities. The spatial spread of COVID-19 infection is simulated by integrating interregional mobility data. According to the simulation results, interregional mobility restrictions can prevent the geographical expansion of the infection. On the other hand, in urban prefectures with many infectious individuals, residents are exposed to higher infection risk when their interregional mobility is restricted. The simulation results also show that interregional mobility restrictions play a limited role in reducing the total number of infected individuals in Japan, suggesting that other non-pharmaceutical interventions should be implemented to reduce the epidemic size.","Kondo, Keisuke",Sci Rep,411,1

Despite the high prevalence of the disease, it has currently no definitive treatment. We here reported the effects of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) administration in severely ill COVID-19 patients diagnosed based on PCR and radiology tests. CASE PRESENTATION: Five severely ill COVID-19 patients in whom standard treatments failed were administrated with IVIG which prevented the deterioration of clinical symptoms. All the patients were treated with high-dose IVIG (0.3–0.5 g/kg) for 5 consecutive days so that no patient would receive lower than 25 g of the drug. All the patients showed a desirable therapeutic response and were discharged from the hospital with a stable clinical condition after being recovered. CONCLUSION: Treatment with IVIG at the therapeutic dose of 0.3–0.5 g/kg can improve the clinical condition and O2 saturation and prevent the progression of pulmonary lesions in COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms in whom standard treatments have failed.","Mohtadi, Negar; Ghaysouri, Abas; Shirazi, Samira; sara Ansari; Shafiee, Elham; Bastani, Elham; Kokhazadeh, Taleb; Tavan, Hamed",Virology,411,21

Patients’ perceptions of stress and their use of coping strategies may influence fatigue severity. This study extends our previous work describing distinct profiles of morning (i.e., Very Low, Low, High, and Very High) and evening (i.e., Low, Moderate, High, and Very High) fatigue in oncology patients by evaluating for differences in stress and coping strategies among these fatigue classes. METHODS: This longitudinal study evaluated for changes in morning and evening fatigue in oncology patients (n = 1332) over two cycles of chemotherapy (CTX). Patients completed measures of cumulative exposure to stressful life events (SLEs) (i.e., the Life Stressor Checklist-Revised), general stress (i.e., Perceived Stress Scale [PSS]), cancer-specific stress (i.e., Impact of Event Scale-Revised [IES-R]), and coping strategies (i.e., Brief Cope). Differences among the latent classes were evaluated using analyses of variance, Kruskal-Wallis, or chi-square tests. RESULTS: Patients in both the Very High morning and evening fatigue classes reported higher numbers of and a higher impact from previous SLEs and higher PSS scores than the other fatigue classes. The IES-R scores for the Very High morning fatigue class met the criterion for subsyndromal PTSD. Patients in the Very High evening fatigue class used a higher number of engagement coping strategies compared with the Very High morning fatigue class. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that interventions to reduce stress and enhance coping warrant investigation to decrease fatigue in patients undergoing CTX.

In the clinic, most patients with COVID‐19 show none or mild symptoms, while approximately 20% of them develop severe pneumonia, multiple organ failure, or septic shock due to infection‐induced cytokine release syndrome (the so‐called “cytokine storm”). Neutralizing antibodies targeting inflammatory cytokines may potentially curb immunopathology caused by COVID‐19; however, the complexity of cytokine interactions and the multiplicity of cytokine targets make attenuating the cytokine storm challenging. Nonspecific in vivo biodistribution and dose‐limiting side effects further limit the broad application of those free antibodies. Recent advances in biomaterials and nanotechnology have offered many promising opportunities for infectious and inflammatory diseases. Here, potential mechanisms of COVID‐19 cytokine storm are first discussed, and relevant therapeutic strategies and ongoing clinical trials are then reviewed. Furthermore, recent research involving emerging biomaterials for improving antibody‐based and broad‐spectrum cytokine neutralization is summarized. It is anticipated that this work will provide insights on the development of novel therapeutics toward efficacious management of COVID‐19 cytokine storm and other inflammatory diseases.","Meng, Qian‐Fang; Tian, Rui; Long, Haiyi; Wu, Xianjia; Lai, Jialin; Zharkova, Olga; Wang, Jiong‐Wei; Chen, Xiaoyuan; Rao, Lang",Adv Mater,411,16

As a result of narrow case definitions and limited capacity for testing, the number of unobserved SARS-CoV-2 infections during its initial invasion of the US remains unknown. We developed an approach for estimating the number of unobserved infections based on data that are commonly available shortly after the emergence of a new infectious disease. The logic of our approach is, in essence, that there are bounds on the amount of exponential growth of new infections that can occur during the first few weeks after imported cases start appearing. Applying that logic to data on imported cases and local deaths in the US through March 12, we estimated that 22,876 (95% posterior predictive interval: 7,451 - 53,044) infections occurred in the US by this date. By comparing the model's predictions of symptomatic infections to local cases reported over time, we obtained daily estimates of the proportion of symptomatic infections detected by surveillance. This revealed that detection of symptomatic infections decreased throughout February as exponential growth of infections outpaced increases in testing. Between February 21 and March 12, we estimated an increase in detection of symptomatic infections, which was strongly correlated (median: 0.97, 95% PPI: 0.85 - 0.98) with increases in testing. These results suggest that testing was a major limiting factor in assessing the extent of SARS-CoV-2 transmission during its initial invasion of the US.","Perkins, Alex; Cavany, Sean M.; Moore, Sean M; Oidtman, Rachel J; Lerch, Anita; Poterek, Marya",,411,16

Vulnerable populations, specifically those suffering from serious mental illness and homelessness, are at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 infection resulting in medical complications and psychiatric destabilization. In addition, mental health has become increasingly relevant throughout the country given the psychological distress people have been facing due to the spread of COVID-19 and the toll of a more restricted way of living. Although the healthcare industry has quickly integrated novel ways of treating patients with mental illness with technological advances, these technologies are not applicable to different populations equally. There is a clear disparity that is represented within the public county health systems, which leads to a widening gap between those who receive adequate treatment for mental illness and those who do not. AIMS: The aims of this paper were to provide a commentary on the benefits of technology-based psychiatric and psychological interventions based off experience in a public health system and based off a relevant, thorough literature review. In addition, we aim to highlight the importance of accessibility of these interventions for vulnerable populations and provide recommendations for integrating these services expeditiously. METHODS: Literature review was conducted using MEDLINE, PubMed and Google Scholar. CONCLUSIONS: Based off data collected from experience in a public health system and literature review, we conclude that although the COVID-19 pandemic has initiated significant innovation to integrate technology for psychiatric care, this innovation is not equally accessible for vulnerable populations suffering from mental health disorders. Within a public county health system, there are barriers with providing mental healthcare to vulnerable populations. These barriers, which are applicable throughout the United States, serve as a rationale for the need of innovative solutions for the integration of these services in not only emergency situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic, but also in daily non-emergent operations to sufficiently address the needs for those needing mental healthcare.","Ojha, Rashi; Syed, Saba",Internet Interv,411,28

However, there is no evidence that human genetic variation in ACE2 is singularly responsible for COVID-19 susceptibility. Therefore, we performed a multi-level characterization of genes that interact with ACE2 (ACE2-gene network) for their over-represented biological properties in the context of COVID-19. The phenome-wide association of 51 genes including ACE2 with 4,756 traits categorized into 26 phenotype categories, showed enrichment of immunological, respiratory, environmental, skeletal, dermatological, and metabolic domains (p<4e-4). Transcriptomic regulation of ACE2-gene network was enriched for tissue-specificity in kidney, small intestine, and colon (p<4.7e-4). Leveraging the drug-gene interaction database we identified 47 drugs, including dexamethasone and spironolactone, among others. Considering genetic variants within ± 10 kb of ACE2-network genes we characterized functional consequences (among others) using miRNA binding-site targets. MiRNAs affected by ACE2-network variants revealed statistical over-representation of inflammation, aging, diabetes, and heart conditions. With respect to variants mapped to the ACE2-network, we observed COVID-19 related associations in RORA, SLC12A6 and SLC6A19 genes.

This study aims to identify the elements of an open hospital culture. METHODS: In this group consensus study with a Delphi technique, statements were constructed based on the existing patient safety literature and input of 11 healthcare professionals from different backgrounds. A final framework consisting of 36 statements was reviewed on inclusion and exclusion, in multiple rounds by 32 experts and professionals working in healthcare. The feedback was analysed and shared with the panel after the group reached consensus on statements (>70% agreement). RESULTS: The procedure resulted in 37 statements representing tangible (ie, leadership, organisational structures and processes, communication systems, employee attitudes, training and development, and patient orientation) and intangible themes (ie, psychological safety, open communication, cohesion, power, blame and shame, morals and ethics, and support and trust). The culture themes’ teamwork and commitment were not specific for an open culture, contradicting the patient safety literature. Thereby, an open mind was shown to be a novel characteristic. CONCLUSIONS: Open culture entails an open mind-set and attitude of professionals beyond the scope of patient safety in which there is mutual awareness of each other’s (un)conscious biases, focus on team relationships and professional well-being and a transparent system with supervisors/leaders being role models and patients being involved. Although it is generally acknowledged that microlevel social processes necessary to enact patient safety deserve more attention, research has largely emphasised system-level structures and processes. This study provides practical enablers for addressing system and microlevel social processes to work towards an open culture in and across teams.","Malik, Romana Fattimah; Buljac-Samardžić, Martina; Amajjar, Ihsane; Hilders, Carina G J M; Scheele, Fedde",BMJ Open,411,26

UR experiences (UREs) can be integrated into the classroom, making authentic research experiences inclusive and available to all students. However, developing UR pedagogy can be challenging for faculty in resource-limited labs, such as community colleges and small liberal arts colleges. Often molecular biology research methods are expensive, time-consuming and need equipment not readily available or affordable in small schools. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is one of the most commonly used techniques in research labs and many UREs. We have investigated loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) as an inexpensive, accessible alternative to PCR for DNA amplification enabling the identification of microorganisms in the context of UREs. LAMP does not require expensive instrumentation or reagents and uses equipment commonly found in teaching labs. By performing the technique, students learn several key scientific skills that will be useful in their undergraduate or graduate STEM careers. We designed guided independent research experiences for several undergraduates that included the use of LAMP. Students successfully applied the technique to culture samples of common environmental bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus, and were in addition, able to detect both Salmonella and Enterococcus in directly sampled environmental waters. To highlight the accessibility and affordability of this URE, a simple boiling method was used for DNA preparation from environmental samples. Student response data show positive attitudes toward UR when LAMP is utilized as a research tool to tackle relevant biological questions. The feasibility of using simplified LAMP in UREs points to a potential, more expanded application to public engagement with science and broader and more inclusive interactions with the research community.","Nguyen, Andrew V.; Orlofsky, Amos; Pubill, Kaylynn; Tawde, Mangala; Li, Gaozhen; Mata, Diana; Bermudes, Oscar; Fernandez, Miguel; Santana, Jonathan; Kim, Woochul; Chimbay, Enzon; Kim, Yeeun; Nguyen, Trieu; Fox, Malcolm; Eralte, Janelly; Metz, Molly; Smyth, Davida S.; Panzeca, Caterina; Khan, Mazhar I.",Front Microbiol,411,26

The pandemic control strategies impacted patient experience directly. Questionnaires evaluating patients reported measures (PREMs) may assess critical issues and represent a helpful tool to measure the patient perception of healthcare service. Our aim was to prospectively assess patient satisfaction about doctor–patient interaction in a high-volume radiation therapy and oncology center during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Cancer patients receiving either systemic and/or radiation treatment underwent a survey. Two validated questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-C30, FACIT-TS-G version 1) and 14 specific questions evaluating patients’ perception of COVID-19 measures were administered. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-five patients admitted to our department from 1–30 April 2020 completed the questionnaires. The majority (66.4%) of patients were women and the most common disease was breast cancer (40%). The average Global Health Status (GHS) of EORTC QLQ-C30 was 61.67. Emotional functioning, social, and cognitive domains obtained scores of 75.48, 80.13, and 84.67, respectively. FACIT-TS-G results revealed 120 patients rated the treatments effective and 108 patients thought the side effects were the same as expected or better. Most (89.6%) rated their treatment good, very good, or excellent. Concerning COVID-19-related questions, patients reported overall very good level of information. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the introduction of strict COVID-19 control measures, there was a high level of cancer outpatient satisfaction.

However, this method is relatively resource- and time-consuming. Here, we compared SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen (N-Ag) testing using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection. Methods Parallel SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and quantitative N-Ag ELISA analysis was executed in nasopharyngeal specimens obtained during SARS-CoV-2 screening in a cohort of pre-hospitalization patients. Results In total, 277 specimens were examined, including 182 (65.7%) RT-PCR-positive specimens, which demonstrated a median cycle threshold (Ct) value of 27 (interquartile range [IQR], 23-35). The SARS-CoV-2 N-Ag was detected in 164/182 RT-PCR-positive specimens (overall sensitivity, 90.1%). Among 95 RT-PCR-negative specimens, 72 were N-Ag-negative (specificity, 75.8%). SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and N-Ag ELISA results demonstrated a strong agreement (Cramer's V, 0.668; p < 0.001). N-Ag concentrations spanned from 5.4 to 296,000 pg/mL (median, 901 pg/mL; IQR, 43-1407 pg/mL) and were inversely correlated with Ct values (Spearman's r=-0.720; p < 0.001). Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 N-Ag ELISA results were in close agreement with RT-PCR results, and N-Ag concentrations were proportional to viral loads.

The resurgence in COVID-19 cases as part of the second wave is observed across Europe and the Americas. The scientific response has enabled a complete structural characterization of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome—novel Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Among the most relevant proteins required by the novel coronavirus to facilitate the cell entry mechanism is the spike protein. This protein possesses a receptor-binding domain (RBD) that binds the cellular angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and then triggers the fusion of viral and host cell membranes. In this regard, a comprehensive characterization of the structural stability of the spike protein is a crucial step to find new therapeutics to interrupt the process of recognition. On the other hand, it has been suggested that the participation of more than one RBD is a possible mechanism to enhance cell entry. Here, we discuss the protein structural stability based on the computational determination of the dynamic contact map and the energetic difference of the spike protein conformations via the mapping of the hydration free energy by the Poisson–Boltzmann method. We expect our result to foster the discussion of the number of RBD involved during recognition and the repurposing of new drugs to disable the recognition by discovering new hotspots for drug targets apart from the flexible loop in the RBD that binds the ACE2.","Moreira, Rodrigo A.; Guzman, Horacio V.; Boopathi, Subramanian; Baker, Joseph L.; Poma, Adolfo B.",Materials (Basel),411,5

R. Wilczek (mung bean) is a Chinese functional food with antioxidant, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities. However, little is known about its antiviral activity. We aimed to investigate the antiviral activity and mechanisms of action of Vigna radiata extract (VRE) against influenza virus. HPLC was conducted to analyze the components of the VRE. The anti-influenza viral activity of VRE in Mardin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells was evaluated by virus titration assays, hemagglutination assays, quantitative RT-PCR assays, cellular α-glucosidase activity assays and neuraminidase activity assays. Chromatographic profiling analysis identified two major flavonoids, vitexin and isovitexin, in the ethanol extract of Vigna radiata. Through in vitro studies, we showed that VRE, at concentrations up to 2,000 μg/ml, exhibited no cytotoxicity in MDCK cells. VRE protected cells from influenza virus-induced cytopathic effects and significantly inhibited viral replication in a concentration-dependent manner. A detailed time-of-addition assay revealed that VRE may act on both the early and late stages of the viral life cycle. We demonstrated that 1) VRE inhibits virus entry by directly blocking the HA protein of influenza virus; 2) VRE inhibits virus entry by directly binding to cellular receptors; 3) VRE inhibits virus penetration; 4) VRE inhibits virus assembly by blocking cellular α-glucosidase activity, thus reducing HA protein trafficking to the cell surface; and 5) VRE inhibits virus release by inhibiting viral neuraminidase activity. In summary, Vigna radiata extract potently interferes with two different subtypes of influenza viruses at multiple steps during the infectious cycle, demonstrating its broad-spectrum potential as an anti-influenza preventive and therapeutic agent. Continued development of Vigna radiata-derived products into antiviral therapeutics is warranted.","Lo, Chieh-Wen; Pi, Chia-Chen; Chen, You-Ting; Chen, Hui-Wen",Front Pharmacol,411,20

In adults, specific saliva antibodies have been detected. Nonetheless, seroprevalence is routinely investigated, while little attention has been paid to mucosal antibodies. We therefore assessed SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody prevalence in serum and saliva in children in the Netherlands. We assessed SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence in serum and saliva of 517 children attending medical services in the Netherlands (irrespective of COVID-19 exposure) from April to October 2020. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S), receptor binding domain (RBD), and nucleocapsid (N)-specific IgG and IgA were evaluated with an exploratory Luminex assay in serum and saliva and with the Wantai SARS-CoV-2 RBD total antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in serum. Using the Wantai assay, the RBD-specific antibody prevalence in serum was 3.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]. 1.9 to 5.3%). With the Luminex assay, we detected heterogeneity between antibodies for S, RBD, and N antigens, as IgG and IgA prevalence ranged between 3.6 and 4.6% in serum and between 0 and 4.4% in saliva. The Luminex assay also revealed differences between serum and saliva, with SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG present in saliva but not in serum for 1.5 to 2.7% of all children. Using multiple antigen assays, the IgG prevalence for at least two out of three antigens (S, RBD, or N) in serum or saliva can be calculated as 3.8% (95% CI, 2.3 to 5.6%).

Robust proof of placental infection requires demonstration of viral localization within placental tissue. Only two of the few cases of possible vertical transmission have demonstrated placental infection. None have shown placental expression of the ACE2 or TMPRSS2 protein, both required for viral infection. We examined 19 COVID-19 exposed placentas for histopathologic findings, and for expression of ACE2, and TMPRSS2 by immunohistochemistry. Direct placental SARS-CoV-2 expression was studied by two methods—nucleocapsid protein expression by immunohistochemistry, and RNA expression by in situ hybridization. ACE2 membranous expression in the syncytiotrophoblast (ST) of the chorionic villi is predominantly in a polarized pattern with expression highest on the stromal side of the ST. In addition, cytotrophoblast and extravillous trophoblast express ACE2. No ACE2 expression was detected in villous stroma, Hofbauer cells, or endothelial cells. TMPRSS2 expression was only present weakly in the villous endothelium and rarely in the ST. In 2 of 19 cases, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was present in the placenta focally in the ST and cytotrophoblast. There was no characteristic histopathology present in our cases including the two placental infections. We found that the placenta is capable of being infected but that this event is rare. We propose one explanation could be the polarized expression of ACE2 away from the maternal blood and pronounced paucity of TMPRSS2 expression in trophoblast.","Hecht, Jonathon L.; Quade, Bradley; Deshpande, Vikram; Mino-Kenudson, Mari; Ting, David T.; Desai, Niyati; Dygulska, Beata; Heyman, Taryn; Salafia, Carolyn; Shen, Dejun; Bates, Sara V.; Roberts, Drucilla J.",Mod Pathol,411,16

On the 30th of April, 64 days after this first diagnosis, the number of patients had increased exponentially, reaching 19,224 confirmed cases and 1859 (9.67%) deaths. In response to this global outbreak, we summarize the current state of our understanding regarding COVID-19 in Mexico. METHODS: We obtained the data from the official website of the Ministry of Health in Mexico. The study period covered the 27th of February to the 30th of April 2020. The cases were confirmed using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assays, and we analyzed the epidemiological, demographic and clinical data. RESULTS: In Mexico, most cases of COVID-19 were located in Mexico City. The mean age of the patients was 46 years. Of the 12,656 confirmed cases, most infected individuals were between the ages of 30 and 59 years (65.85%), and there was a higher incidence rate for men (58.18%) than for women (41.82%). The patients who died had one or more comorbidities, mainly hypertension (45.53%), diabetes (39.39%) and obesity (30.4%). In the first 64 days of the epidemic, China had reported 80,304 cases, with a mortality rate of 3.66%. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate the early transmission of COVID-19 in Mexico. The descriptive epidemiology shows similarities between the cases of COVID-19 in Mexico and those in China. In the same period of the epidemic curve, we observed a reduction in the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Mexico and a higher mortality rate compared with that of China.","Suárez, V.; Suarez Quezada, M.; Oros Ruiz, S.; Ronquillo De Jesús, E.",Rev Clin Esp (Barc),411,5

Markers that could predict patients at risk of poor outcomes would be extremely useful clinically. Evidence has emerged that low lymphocyte count is associated with increased disease severity. Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the association between lymphocyte count and severity of SARS-CoV-2 associated clinical disease. Results: Seven papers were included in the meta-analysis. These papers included data from 2083 patients, 25% (n=521) with severe SAR-CoV-2 disease and 75% (n=1562) with non-severe SAR-CoV-2 disease. Heterogenicity was seen in the definition of severe disease. Metanalysis produced metamedians of 1x109/L (95% CI 1-1.1) and 0.7x109/L (95% CI 0.63-0.8) lymphocytes for patients with non-severe and severe disease respectively (p-value of p=0.006 Wilcoxon test). Calculation of metamedians from the two papers classifying severe disease according to death alone gave 1.1 1x109/L lymphocytes (95% CI 1.0-1.1) for “survivors” (n=163) and 0.63 1x109/L lymphocytes (95% CI 0.60-0.63) for “non-survivors” (n=253) of SAR-CoV-2 disease. Conclusions: Lower lymphocyte counts are significantly associated with more severe disease in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Lymphocytopenia may therefore be useful laboratory measure to allow prognostication of patients presenting with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Brown, Robin A C; Barnard, Jane; Harris-Skillman, Eva; Harbinson, Bronwen; Dunne, Beata; Drake, Jonathan; Roche, Sophie; Harris, Edward; Gunnel, James; Frost, Joshu; Angus, Brian; Hodgson, Susanne",,411,26

DESIGN: A qualitative inductive design was used. Data were collected using interviews and analysed with content analysis carried out with NVivo 12. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen midwives working at delivery wards at three hospitals in the south of Sweden. FINDINGS: Three categories emerged: “Promote, protect and support the physiological process of labour”, “To make the decision -to do or not to do” and “Unpredictable response”. The overall theme linking the three categories was “We become our decisions”, portraying how midwives carry the responsibility in the decision-making and represent themselves in their handling of amniotomy. CONCLUSIONS: Amniotomy was experienced and viewed as both simple and complex, safe and risky, and deciding on it sometimes implied balancing contradicting perspectives. By using midwifery skills in the decision-making for an amniotomy, the midwives tried to predict the response, purposing to support physiological labour and promote health for women and babies.","Ingvarsson, Sofia; Oscarsson, Marie; Schildmeijer, Kristina",Midwifery,411,1

It is similar to influenza viruses and raises concerns through alarming levels of spread and severity resulting in an ongoing pandemic worldwide. Within eight months (by August 2020), it infected 24.0 million persons worldwide and over 824 thousand have died. Drones or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are very helpful in handling the COVID-19 pandemic. This work investigates the drone-based systems, COVID-19 pandemic situations, and proposes an architecture for handling pandemic situations in different scenarios using real-time and simulation-based scenarios. The proposed architecture uses wearable sensors to record the observations in Body Area Networks (BANs) in a push–pull data fetching mechanism. The proposed architecture is found to be useful in remote and highly congested pandemic areas where either the wireless or Internet connectivity is a major issue or chances of COVID-19 spreading are high. It collects and stores the substantial amount of data in a stipulated period and helps to take appropriate action as and when required. In real-time drone-based healthcare system implementation for COVID-19 operations, it is observed that a large area can be covered for sanitization, thermal image collection, and patient identification within a short period (2 KMs within 10 min approx.) through aerial route. In the simulation, the same statistics are observed with an addition of collision-resistant strategies working successfully for indoor and outdoor healthcare operations. Further, open challenges are identified and promising research directions are highlighted.","Kumar, Adarsh; Sharma, Kriti; Singh, Harvinder; Naugriya, Sagar Gupta; Gill, Sukhpal Singh; Buyya, Rajkumar",Future Gener Comput Syst,411,20

According to the current studies, numerous diseases including lung disease, cardiovascular disease, and immunosuppression appear to be at higher risk for severe forms of the COVID‐19. To date, there are no data in the literature on the comorbid dermatologic diseases and COVID‐19. We tried to analyze the previous dermatological comorbidity of 93 patients with COVID‐19 (51 males, 42 females) who presented to the dermatology outpatient clinics for the last 3 years. The most common dermatologic diseases in patients with COVID‐19 who have dermatologic diseases for the last three years were superficial fungal infections (24, 25.8%), seborrheic dermatitis (11, 11.8%), actinic keratosis (10, 10.8%), psoriasis (6, 6.5%) and eczema (6, 6.5%), respectively. In addition, the number of COVID‐19 patients who presented to dermatology in the last three months was 17 (11 men, 6 women). The median age of these patients was 58 (minimum 18, maximum 80) years, and the most common dermatologic diseases before diagnosed COVID‐19 were superficial fungal infections (5, 25%), psoriasis (4, 20%), and viral skin diseases (3, 15%). The possible similarity between cutaneous and mucosal immunity and immunosuppression suggests that patients with some dermatologic diseases especially superficial fungal infections and psoriasis may be more vulnerable to the COVID‐19.

The occurrences of COVID infections are uneven across countries and the same is determined by socioeconomic situations prevailing in the countries besides the preparedness and management. The paper is an attempt to empirically examine the socioeconomic determinants of the occurrence of COVID in Asian countries considering the data as of June 18, 2020, for 42 Asian countries. A multiple regression analysis in a cross‐sectional framework is specified and ordinary least square (OLS) technique with heteroscedasticity corrected robust standard error is employed to obtain regression coefficients. Explanatory variables that are highly collinear have been dropped from the analysis. The findings of the study show a positive significant association of per capita gross national income and net migration with the incidence of total COVID‐19 cases and daily new cases. The size of net migration emerged to be a potential factor and positive in determining the total and new cases of COVID. Social capital as measured by voters' turnout ratio (VTR) in order to indicate the people's participation is found to be significant and negative for daily new cases per million population. People's participation has played a very important role in checking the incidence of COVID cases and its spread. In alternate models, countries having high incidence of poverty are also having higher cases of COVID. Though the countries having higher percentage of aged populations are more prone to be affected by the spread of virus, but the sign of the coefficient of this variable for Asian country is not in the expected line. Previous year health expenditure and diabetic prevalence rate are not significant in the analysis. Therefore, people‐centric plan and making people more participatory and responsive in adhering to the social distancing norms in public and workplace and adopting preventive measures need to be focused on COVID management strategies. The countries having larger net migration and poverty ratio need to evolve comprehensive and inclusive strategies for testing, tracing, and massive awareness for sanitary practices, social distancing, and following government regulation for management of COVID‐19, besides appropriate food security measures and free provision of sanitary kits for vulnerable section.","Varkey, Rittu S.; Joy, Justin; Sarmah, Gargee; Panda, Prasant K.",J Public Aff,411,17

Enforced by State-related actors, these were promoted as the only method to curtail transmissions as soon as possible. However, as with other harsh measures witnessed by Liberian citizens, in many cases those measures elicited uncontrolled negative reactions within the communities (stigma; fear) that produced, in some cases, the opposite effect of that intended. METHODOLOGY: The research has been conducted in two phases, for a total of 8 weeks. Ethnography of local practices was carried out in 7 neighbourhoods in Monrovia and 5 villages in Grand Cape Mount County in Liberia. 45 Focus Group Discussions (432 participants) and 30 semi-structured interviews sustained the observing participation. Randomly selected people from different social layers were targeted. The principal investigator worked with the help of two local assistants. Perceptions and practices were both analysed. RESULTS: Participants stressed how cremation perpetuated the social breakdown that started with the isolation for the sickness. Socio-economical divides were created by inequitable management of the dead: those who could bribe the burial teams obtained a burial in a private cemetery or the use of Funeral Homes. Conversely, those in economic disadvantage were forced to send their dead for cremation. State-enforced quarantine, with a mandatory prohibition of movement, raised condemnation, strengthened stigmatization and created serious socio-economic distress. Food was distributed intermittently and some houses shared latrines with non-quarantined neighbours. Escapes were also recorded. Study participants narrated how they adopted local measures of containment, through local task forces and socially-rooted control of outsiders. They also stressed how information that was not spread built up rumours and suspicion. CONCLUSIONS: Populations experiencing an epidemic feel a high degree of social insecurity, in addition to the health hazards. Vertical and coercive measures increase mistrust and fear, producing a counter-productive effect in the containment of the epidemic. On the other hand, local communities show a will to be engaged and a high degree of flexibility in participating to the epidemic response. Efforts in the direction of awareness and community involvement could prove to be better strategy to control the epidemic and root the response on social participation.","Pellecchia, Umberto; Crestani, Rosa; Decroo, Tom; Van den Bergh, Rafael; Al-Kourdi, Yasmine",PLoS One,411,26

Studies in a wide range of ruminant and camelid species as well as mice have been instrumental in understanding BTV transmission, bluetongue (BT) pathogenicity/pathogenesis, viral virulence, the induced immune response, as well as reproductive failures associated with BTV infection. These studies have in many cases been complemented by in vitro studies with BTV in different cell types in tissue culture. Together these studies have formed the basis for the understanding of BTV-host interaction and have contributed to the design of successful control strategies, including the development of effective vaccines. This review describes some of the fundamental and contemporary infection studies that have been conducted with BTV in the mammalian host and provides an overview of the principal animal welfare issues that should be considered when designing experimental infection studies with BTV in in vivo infection models.

Model estimates can be used to inform event organizers about the possibility of super-spreading and the predicted efficacy of safety protocols, as well as to communicate to participants their personalised risk so that they may choose whether to attend. Yet, despite the fast-growing body of literature on COVID transmission dynamics, current risk models either neglect contextual information on vaccination rates or disease prevalence or do not attempt to quantitatively model transmission, thus limiting their potential to provide insightful estimates. This paper attempts to bridge this gap by providing informative risk metrics for live public events, along with a measure of their associated uncertainty. Starting with a thorough review of the literature and building upon existing models, our approach ties together three main components: (a) reliable modelling of the number of infectious cases at the time of the event, (b) evaluation of the efficiency of pre-event screening and risk mitigation protocols, and (c) modelling the transmission dynamics during the event. We demonstrate how uncertainty in the input parameters can be included in the model using Monte Carlo simulations.

Here, we integrate human primary airway epithelial cells into a custom-engineered 96-device platform (PREDICT96-ALI) in which tissues are cultured in an array of microchannel-based culture chambers at an air–liquid interface, in a configuration compatible with high resolution in-situ imaging and real-time sensing. We apply this platform to influenza A virus and coronavirus infections, evaluating viral infection kinetics and antiviral agent dosing across multiple strains and donor populations of human primary cells. Human coronaviruses HCoV-NL63 and SARS-CoV-2 enter host cells via ACE2 and utilize the protease TMPRSS2 for spike protein priming, and we confirm their expression, demonstrate infection across a range of multiplicities of infection, and evaluate the efficacy of camostat mesylate, a known inhibitor of HCoV-NL63 infection.

RESULTS: A total of 1070 patients (median age 66, IQR 54-75, 626 men) were included, of whom 536/1070 (50%) had a positive RT-PCR, 137/1070 (13%) patients were considered to have a possible or probable COVID- 19 based on the clinical reference standard. Chest CT yielded an AUC of 0.87 (95%CI 0.84-0.89) compared with RT-PCR and 0.87 (95%CI 0.85-0.89) compared with the clinical reference standard. A CO-RADS score ≥4 yielded an OR of 25.9 (95%CI 18.7-35.9) for a COVID-19 diagnosis by RT-PCR, and an OR of 30.6 (95%CI 21.1-44.4) by the clinical reference standard. For symptom duration of less than 48 hours, the AUC fell to 0.71 (95%CI 0.62-0.80; P<.001). CONCLUSION: Chest CT analysis using the COVID-19 reporting and data system (CO-RADS) enables rapid and reliable diagnosis of COVID-19, particularly when symptom duration is greater than 48 hours.

A total of 16,912 staff members were tested for SARS-CoV-2 between March 10 and June 24, 2020 with 1,799 (10.6%) testing positive. Nurses and midwives had the highest number of infections (33.2% of all infected HCWs) followed by non-clinical support service staff (31.3%), administrative staff (14.6%), allied health professionals (12.7%), physicians (5.2% and other clinical support staff (2.9%). Among 671 infected HCW surveyed by the infection prevention and control team immediately after the positive COVID-19 test was reported, exposure to a family member or roommate with confirmed infection each were reported by 9.5%. Two-thirds of the infected HCWs were symptomatic with fever (34.6%), cough (32.2%) and sore throat (15.8%) being the most commonly reported symptoms. Among the survey respondents, 78 (11.6%) were hospitalized, 9 (1.3%) required supplemental oxygen, 4 (0.6%) were admitted to the intensive care unit) and 2 (0.3%) required mechanical ventilation. There were no deaths. To understand the transmission dynamics and impact of facility designation as COVID-19 or non-COVID-19 facility, we conducted a focused follow-up telephone survey on 393 COVID-19 positive HCW 1-6 weeks after diagnosis. Only 5% of respondents reported acquiring the virus from working at a COVID-19 designated facility while the remaining 95% reported working at a non-COVID-19 facility and acquired the infection from accidental exposure to a colleague (45%) or to a patient (29%).

We describe a case of a 36-year-old coronavirus-positive patient that was admitted on emergency basis; his clinical presentation included neurological symptoms such as drowsiness and mild confusion. Imaging revealed findings consistent with meningoencephalitis complicated by intracerebral hematoma and subdural hematoma. The latter was surgically evacuated after it became chronic and evidence of coronavirus was found in the fluid. Our experience confirms that neurological complications might be a likely event in COVID-19. Although uncommon, the possible occurrence of meningoencephalitis should be kept in mind by physicians involved in the management of COVID-19 patients. Early recognition of brain involvement may provide better prognosis, preventing evolution into intracerebral hemorrhagic events.","Al-olama, Mohammad; Rashid, Anas; Garozzo, Debora",Acta Neurochir (Wien),411,20

Our aim was the characterization of epitopes in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein to generate a peptide vaccine. Epitope mapping using a panel of 10 amino acid overlapped 15-mer peptides covering region 401-515 from RBD did not identify linear epitopes when tested with sera from infected individuals or from RBD-immunized mice. However, immunization of mice with these 15-mer peptides identified four peptides located at region 446-480 that induced antibodies recognizing the peptides and RBD/S1 proteins. Immunization with peptide 446-480 from S protein formulated with Freund’s adjuvant or with CpG oligodeoxinucleotide/Alum induced polyepitopic antibody responses in BALB/c and C56BL/6J mice, recognizing RBD (titres of 3 × 10(4)–3 × 10(5), depending on the adjuvant) and displaying neutralizing capacity (80–95% inhibition capacity; p < 0.05) against SARS-CoV-2. Murine CD4 and CD8T-cell epitopes were identified in region 446-480 and vaccination experiments using HLA transgenic mice suggested the presence of multiple human T-cell epitopes. Antibodies induced by peptide 446-480 showed broad recognition of S proteins and S-derived peptides belonging to SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Importantly, vaccination with peptide 446-480 or with a cyclic version of peptide 446-488 containing a disulphide bridge between cysteines 480 and 488, protected humanized K18-hACE2 mice from a lethal dose of SARS-CoV-2 (62.5 and 75% of protection; p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively).

Thus, phytocompounds with broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory activity that target multiple SARS-CoV-2 proteins will enhance the development of effective drugs against the disease. In this study, an in-house library of 117 steroidal plant-derived pregnanes (PDPs) was docked in the active regions of human glucocorticoid receptors (hGRs) in a comparative molecular docking analysis. Based on the minimal binding energy and a comparative dexamethasone binding mode analysis, a list of top twenty ranked PDPs docked in the agonist conformation of hGR, with binding energies ranging between −9.8 and −11.2 kcal/mol, was obtained and analyzed for possible interactions with the human Janus kinases 1 and Interleukins-6 and SARS-CoV-2 3-chymotrypsin-like protease, Papain-like protease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. For each target protein, the top three ranked PDPs were selected. Eight PDPs (bregenin, hirundigenin, anhydroholantogenin, atratogenin A, atratogenin B, glaucogenin A, glaucogenin C and glaucogenin D) with high binding tendencies to the catalytic residues of multiple targets were identified. A high degree of structural stability was observed from the 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation analyses of glaucogenin C and hirundigenin complexes of hGR. The selected top-eight ranked PDPs demonstrated high druggable potentials and favourable in silico ADMET properties. Thus, the therapeutic potentials of glaucogenin C and hirundigenin can be explored for further in vitro and in vivo studies.","Gyebi, Gideon A.; Ogunyemi, Oludare M.; Ibrahim, Ibrahim M.; Afolabi, Saheed O.; Adebayo, Joseph O.",Comput Biol Med,411,16

Scope Epidemiology studies spatiotemporal patterns of illness in populations and the factors affecting it. An epidemic emerges out of the population activities and environment. Task assignment is a common activity in many realms where sub-tasks are created, delegated, and collectively carried out to achieve the original task. Due to its complexity and context, task assignment can be a challenging activity that can result in limited outcomes. This research studies task assignment as an epidemic assigned to a distributed system. We have developed computational models to understand the outbreak of aerosol-borne diseases by using the agent-based modelling approach. Experiments are carried out to observe the patterns of emergence during the spread of disease among the individuals and get insights of their mechanisms. These mechanisms are used to design algorithms for task assignment on distributed systems. Results Understanding the emergent behaviour of diseases can provide the platform for the development of distributed algorithms that can be helpful in overcoming some of the challenges of task assignment in a distributed system.","Brahmbhatt, Parth; Camorlinga, Sergio G.",Procedia Computer Science,411,9

METHODS We conducted waiting room surveys in two hospital diabetes clinics and one hospital antenatal clinic in South Australia, and follow up telephone interviews with 20 patients. We examined extent of access to, use of and benefits from digital health services, and what barriers people encountered. We undertook mixed methods, with quantitative descriptive analysis and qualitative analysis. RESULTS 37 diabetes clinic patients (54% response rate) and 99 antenatal clinic patients (33% response rate) participated. Sixty two percent of the patients with diabetes and 27% of antenatal clinic patients had never used digital health services. Seventeen percent of patients with diabetes and 30% of antenatal clinic patients were hesitant users, and 22% of patients with diabetes and 44% of antenatal clinic patients were confident users. Barriers included struggling to afford the technology or to stay connected and lack of trust in online health information. Potential benefits included feeling more empowered and complementing face to face care. CONCLUSIONS There are socioeconomic barriers to access, use of, and ability to benefit from digital health strategies that mean not everyone will be able to benefit from digital health services. SO WHAT?: As COVID-19 accelerates the shift towards digital health services, people experiencing socioeconomic disadvantage may be excluded. If barriers to access and use are not addressed, they will exacerbate already increasing health inequities.","Freeman, Toby; Fisher, Matt; Foley, Kristen; Boyd, Mark A; Ward, Paul R; McMichael, Gai; Zimmermann, Anthony; Dekker, Gustaaf",Health promotion journal of Australia : official journal of Australian Association of Health Promotion Professionals,411,16

From the last decade, hepatitis C diagnosis has been revolutionized by the advent and approval of state-of-the-art HCV diagnostic platforms which have been efficiently implemented in high-risk HCV populations in developed nations as well as in some low-to-middle income countries (LMICs) to identify millions of undiagnosed hepatitis C-infected individuals. Point-of-care (POC) rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs; POC-RDTs), RNA reflex testing, hepatitis C self-test assays, and dried blood spot (DBS) sample analysis have been proven their diagnostic worth in real-world clinical experiences both at centralized and decentralized diagnostic settings, in mass hepatitis C screening campaigns, and hard-to-reach aboriginal hepatitis C populations in remote areas. The present review article overviews the significance of current and emerging hepatitis C diagnostic packages to subvert the public health care burden of this ‘silent epidemic’ worldwide. We also highlight the challenges that remain to be met about the affordability, accessibility, and health system-related barriers to overcome while modulating the hepatitis C care cascade to adopt a ‘test and treat’ strategy for every hepatitis C-affected individual. We also elaborate some key measures and strategies in terms of policy and progress to be part of hepatitis C care plans to effectively link diagnosis to care cascade for rapid treatment uptake and, consequently, hepatitis C cure.","Shahid, Imran; Alzahrani, Abdullah R.; Al-Ghamdi, Saeed S.; Alanazi, Ibrahim M.; Rehman, Sidra; Hassan, Sajida",Diagnostics (Basel),411,27

METHODS: This study was undertaken at two large teaching hospitals in the UK. Pharmacy staff attended local departmental focus groups. Staff attendance included pharmacists, pharmacy technicians and pharmacy assistants representing all pharmacy services including aseptics, ward-based services, dispensary/distribution and procurement. Responses were transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: A total of 138 pharmacy staff attended the departmental focus groups. This study identified which pharmacy-related changes implemented in the first wave will be beneficial to take forward into a second wave. These included extending the hours of the pharmacy service to critical care, retaining the competence of pharmacists and pharmacy technicians redeployed to critical care during wave 1, development of standard operating procedures for changes in practice, delivering/posting of dispensed outpatient medication to patients’ place of residence, maintenance of ward-based pharmacy services, use of the healthcare app PANDO to aid team communication, utilisation of remote-controlled drug ordering, deployment of a COVID-19 ward stocklist, procurement of ready-made bags/prefilled syringes of critical care medications, aligning the central intravenous additive service with critical care demand to reduce waste and establishment of a pharmacy response in line with the hospital’s implementation plan.

With the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) continuing to extend its timeline for ending the transmission of all wild polioviruses and to introduce new poliovirus vaccines, the polio vaccine supply chain continues to expand in complexity. The increased complexity leads to significant uncertainty about supply and costs. Notably, the strategy of phased OPV cessation of all three serotypes to stop all future incidence of poliomyelitis depends on successfully stopping the transmission of all wild polioviruses. Countries also face challenges associated with responding to any outbreaks that occur after OPV cessation, because stopping transmission of such outbreaks requires reintroducing the use of the stopped OPV in most countries. National immunization program leaders will likely consider differences in their risks and willingness‐to‐pay for risk reduction as they evaluate their investments in current and future polio vaccination. Information about the costs and benefits of future poliovirus vaccines, and discussion of the complex situation that currently exists, should prove useful to national, regional, and global decisionmakers and support health economic modeling. Delays in achieving polio eradication combined with increasing costs of poliovirus vaccines continue to increase financial risks for the GPEI.","Thompson, Kimberly M.; Kalkowska, Dominika A.",Risk Anal,411,1

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective controlled clinical study. SETTING: Tertiary referral medical center. METHODS: Twenty consecutive patients hospitalized in the otolaryngology department of a tertiary medical center due to unilateral hearing loss (HL study group), and 30 consecutive inpatients on the same ward who had no otological history (controls) were enrolled. Each participant underwent the traditional 512 Hz tuning fork-based Rinne test, as well as a smartphone-based Rinne test by means of a single uncovered smartphone with a vibration application. The test results were compared to those of formal audiometry. RESULTS: The overall agreement between the traditional Rinne test and the smartphone-based test was 98%. The Sensitivity was 85% for both tests, specificity was 90% and 93% for smartphone and tuning fork tests, respectively. The smartphone-based Rinne test could correctly discriminate between patients with an air–bone gap ≥ 25 dB at 512 Hz from patients with a lower or no air–bone gap at 512 Hz. The smartphone-based Rinne could not evaluate two patients with a moderately severe/severe sensorineural hearing loss due to their inability to detect the vibrations. CONCLUSION: A smartphone-based Rinne test was validated for the detection of an air–bone gap ≥ 25 dB at 512 Hz in the clinical setting.

However, a focus must also be on proper and effective risk communication. This is especially the case during pandemics that have high rates of infection, significant morbidity, lack of therapeutic measures, and rapid increases in cases, all of which apply to the current COVID-19 pandemic. A consequence of poor risk communication and heightened risk perception is hoarding behavior, which can lead to lack of medications and personal protective equipment. One potential way to ensure appropriate risk communication is utilizing social media channels, and ensuring an ongoing consistent media presence. Another important step is to include all stakeholders including members of the allergy community in broader public health messaging. As we continue to face unprecedented times in the allergy community, an understanding and appreciation of risk communication will be essential as we communicate with, and inform, our patients, and our colleagues, moving forward.","Abrams, Elissa M.; Greenhawt, Matthew",J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract,411,16

Isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes were collected from scarlet fever patients in central Taiwan and were characterized by emm sequencing and a standardized pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) method. National weekly report data were collected for investigating epidemiological trends. RESULTS: A total of 23 emm types were identified in 1,218 S. pyogenes isolates. The five most prevalent emm types were emm12 (50.4%), emm4 (23.2%), emm1 (16.4%), emm6 (3.8%) and emm22 (3.0%). PFGE analysis with SmaI suggested that, with a few exceptions, strains with a common emm type belonged to the same clone. There were two large emm12 clones, one with DNA resistant to cleavage by SmaI. Each prevalent emm clone had major PFGE strain(s) and many minor strains. Most of the minor strains emerged in the population and disappeared soon after. Even some major strains remained prevalent for only 2–3 years before declining. The large fluctuation of scarlet fever cases between 2000 and 2006 was associated with the shuffling of six prevalent emm clones. In 2003, the dramatic drop in scarlet fever cases in central Taiwan and throughout the whole country was associated with the occurrence of a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak that occurred between late-February and mid-June in Taiwan. CONCLUSION: The occurrences of scarlet fever in central Taiwan in 2000–2006 were primarily caused by five emm types, which accounted for 96.8% of the isolates collected. Most of the S. pyogenes strains (as defined by PFGE genotypes) emerged and lasted for only a few years. The fluctuation in the number of scarlet fever cases during the seven years can be primarily attributed to the shuffling of six prevalent emm clones and to the SARS outbreak in 2003.","Chiou, Chien-Shun; Wang, You-Wun; Chen, Pei-Ling; Wang, Wan-Ling; Wu, Ping-Fuai; Wei, Hsiao-Lun",BMC Microbiol,411,8

Sociodemographic, major characteristics, and knowledge of the novel coronavirus pneumonia were also identified as potential influencing factors of stress. The study revealed that medical students are suffering from more stress than non-medical students almost in all provinces of China. Four influencing factors including level of familiarity with the novel coronavirus, family income, major of students, and status of the intern student can be significantly related to students’ stress in the medical group by using the univariate and multivariate analysis. Further analysis showed that students with low stress had a greater number of positive psychological emotions and a lower number of negative psychological emotions than with medical students with high stress. In addition, high stress caused low enthusiasm for learning in these medical students and lead to little/no willingness to do professional medical work in the future. In conclusion, we need to increase the level of our knowledge related to the novel coronavirus pneumonia to reduce stress and strongly focus on the special populations in medical students with certain features, such as intern students, clinical nursing students, and low-income families, to improve their learning attitudes and establish positive professional mental outlooks.","Ye, Wan; Ye, Xinxin; Liu, Yuanyuan; Liu, Qixi; Vafaei, Somayeh; Gao, Yuzhen; Yu, Huiqin; Zhong, Yanxia; Zhan, Chenju",Front Psychol,411,22

Given the coexistence of work in the office and work from home (WFH) in the future, studies are needed to identify ways to increase productivity when working in both places. We conducted a questionnaire survey and environment measurements of 916 workers in 22 offices across 2 weeks in November–December 2020 in Japan. While average workdays at the offices decreased from 4.9 to 3.9 days/week, those at homes increased from 0.1 to 1.1 days/week due to COVID‐19, indicating an increase in the relative importance of WFH. Compared to the office, the satisfaction rate was lower for lighting, spatial, and information technology (IT) environments, but higher for thermal, air, and sound environments at home. Although it was easier to concentrate on work and to refresh at home, workers experienced challenges associated with business communication from home. Meanwhile, in the office, satisfaction with COVID‐19 countermeasures was significantly associated with work productivity. Furthermore, lower PM(2.5) concentration was associated with greater satisfaction with COVID‐19 countermeasures, indicating that reducing PM(2.5) may increase satisfaction with COVID‐19 countermeasures and work productivity. We expect these findings will help improve work productivity in the New Normal era.","Umishio, Wataru; Kagi, Naoki; Asaoka, Ryo; Hayashi, Motoya; Sawachi, Takao; Ueno, Takahiro",Indoor Air,411,16

OBJECTIVES: We characterized exposures during routine household cleaning and tested an intervention to reduce exposures to cleaning product chemicals. METHODS: The Lifting Up Communities with Interventions and Research (LUCIR) Study is a youth-led, community-based intervention project. Youth researchers conducted personal air monitoring with 50 Latina women while they cleaned their homes with their regular cleaning products (preintervention visit) and then 1 week later while they used “green” cleaning products provided by the study (postintervention visit). Air samples were analyzed for volatile and semivolatile organic compounds using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography. We compared pre- and postintervention air concentrations of 47 chemicals of concern, selected because they were on California’s Proposition 65 list of carcinogens or reproductive/developmental toxicants or were suspected endocrine disruptors. Youth researchers were integrally involved in the study design, data collection, interpretation, and dissemination of findings. RESULTS: We observed statistically significant decreases in air concentrations of 17 chemicals of concern when participants switched to green cleaning products, including decreases in geometric mean concentrations of 1,4-dioxane ([Formula: see text]), chloroform ([Formula: see text]), benzene ([Formula: see text]), naphthalene ([Formula: see text]), toluene ([Formula: see text]), and hexane ([Formula: see text]). We observed significant increases in air concentrations of three fragrance compounds: the plant-derived terpene, beta-myrcene (221.5%), and the synthetic musks celestolide (31.0%) and galaxolide (79.6%). Almost all participants (98%) said the replacement products worked as well as their original products, and 90% said that they would consider buying the replacement products in the future. DISCUSSION: This study demonstrates that choosing cleaning products that are marketed as green may reduce exposure to several carcinogens and endocrine disruptors. Future studies should determine whether use of unscented green products would further reduce exposure to terpenes and musks. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP8831","Harley, Kim G.; Calderon, Lucia; Nolan, James E.S.; Maddalena, Randy; Russell, Marion; Roman, Katherine; Mayo-Burgos, Stephanie; Cabrera, Jessica; Morga, Norma; Bradman, Asa",Environ Health Perspect,411,17

While infectious SARS-CoV-2 has yet to be identified in the aquatic environment, the virus potentially enters the wastewater stream from patient excretions and a precautionary approach dictates evaluating transmission pathways to ensure public health and safety. Although enveloped viruses have presumed low persistence in water and are generally susceptible to inactivation by environmental stressors, previously identified enveloped viruses persist in the aqueous environment from days to several weeks. Our analysis suggests that not only the surface water, but also groundwater, represent SARS-CoV-2 control points through possible leaching and infiltrations of effluents from health care facilities, sewage, and drainage water. Most fecally transmitted viruses are highly persistent in the aquatic environment, and therefore, the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in water is essential to inform its fate in water, wastewater and groundwater and subsequent human exposure.","Kumar, Manish; Thakur, Alok Kumar; Mazumder, Payal; Kuroda, Keisuke; Mohapatra, Sanjeeb; Rinklebe, Jörg; Ramanathan, A.

Host innate immune response has been implicated in recognition, protection and immune pathological mechanisms. Host-viral interactions are generally initiated via host recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) of the virus. This recognition occurs through host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) which are expressed on innate immune cells such as epithelial cells, dendritic cells, macrophages and neutrophils. Multiple PRR families, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) and NOD-like receptors (NLRs), contribute significantly to viral detection, leading to induction of cytokines, chemokines and type I interferons (IFNs), which subsequently facilitate the eradication of the virus. This review focuses on the current literature on RSV and hMPV infection and the role of PRRs in establishing/mediating the infection in both in vitro and in vivo models. A better understanding of the complex interplay between these two viruses and host PRRs might lead to efficient prophylactic and therapeutic treatments, as well as the development of adequate vaccines.","Kolli, Deepthi; Velayutham, Thangam Sudha; Casola, Antonella",Pathogens,411,1

EBS should be performed by Family Doctors in a primary care setting and concern prevalent diseases in adults, such as: obesity (BMI), hypertension (BP measurement), diabetes (glycaemia), dyslipidemia (cholesterol/lipids), colon cancer (FOBT/colonoscopy), breast cancer (mammography), STIs (chlamydia, syphilis), HIV, HBV, HCV (i.e. serology or other rapid tests), HPV (swabs), cervical cancer (test Pap). depression (i.e., PHQ-9), and smoking (i.e., Fagerstrom). METHODS: Four needs-based research actions were led among citizens and healthcare professionals, based on multidimensional empowerment. Internal Strengths and Weaknesses of the ongoing implementation process were identified through these studies, whereas external Opportunities and Threats were determined by the present socio-cultural and political context. This SWOT analysis is likely to guide future state-based initiatives to accomplish EBS implementation in Ukraine. RESULTS: Internal Strengths are the bottom-up multidimensional empowerment approach, teaching of EBS and the development of an internet-based platform “Screening adviser” to assist shared decision making for person-centred EBS programs. Internal Weaknesses identified for the Family Doctors are a heterogeneous screening and the risk of decreasing motivation to screen. External Opportunities include the ongoing PHC reform, the existent WONCA and WHO support, and the existence of EBS programs in Europe. External Threats are the lack of national guidelines, not fully introduced gate keeping system, the vulnerable socio-economic situation, the war situation in the East of Ukraine and the Covid-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: We started EBS implementation through research actions, based on a multidimensional empowerment of citizens, HCP and in EBS pathways involved stakeholder teams, to foster a sustainable operational human resource to get involved in that new EBS pathway to implement. The presented SWOT-analysis of this ongoing implementation process allows to plan and optimize future steps towards a state based and supports EBS program in Ukraine.","Kolesnyk, Pavlo; Frese, Thomas; Vinker, Shlomo; Shushman, Ivanna; Zharkova, Albina; Messaadi, Nassir; Kolesnyk, Andriy; Bayen, Sabine",BMC Fam Pract,411,13

It identified immediate activities required for global preparedness and response to the outbreak and set eight priority areas (pillars) essential for scaling up countries’ operational readiness and response. Despite a semi-annual progress report on implementing the Global Strategic Plan in June 2020, there is limited granular information available on the extent of the national plan’s content and implementation, particularly in the Member States of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). Therefore, we sought to review the preparedness and responsiveness towards the COVID-19 outbreak in the GCC in the first phase of the pandemic and to document lessons learned for improving the ongoing response efforts and preparedness for future pandemics. METHODS: A rapid appraisal was conducted in June 2020 according to the WHO Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan and the accompanying Operational Planning Guidelines. The survey was administered to public health professionals or/and infectious disease experts in the states. The findings were cross-triangulated with secondary data that was publicly available for each country. RESULTS: The preparedness and response efforts of Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE were fully compliant with all 11 (100%) pillars of the modified strategic response measures. Kuwait, Oman, and Qatar complied with eight of the pillars. The component on conducting COVID-19 related research was the lowest-performing across all the six states. CONCLUSIONS: All GCC states demonstrated an effective response to the pandemic, enhanced existing infrastructures, and accelerated reforms that would have otherwise taken longer.

Although the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is less clinically apparent, collecting high-quality biospecimens from infants, children, and adolescents in a standardized manner during the COVID-19 pandemic is essential to establish a biologic understanding of the disease in the pediatric population. This biorepository enables pediatric centers world-wide to collect samples uniformly to drive forward our understanding of COVID-19 by addressing specific pediatric and neonatal COVID-19-related questions. METHODS: A COVID-19 biospecimen collection study was implemented with strategic enrollment guidelines to include patients seen in urgent care clinics and hospital settings, neonates born to SARS-CoV-2 infected mothers, and asymptomatic children. The methodology described here, details the importance of establishing collaborations between the clinical and research teams to harmonize protocols for patient recruitment and sample collection, processing and storage. It also details modifications required for biobanking during a surge of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Considerations and challenges facing enrollment of neonatal and pediatric cohorts are described. A roadmap is laid out for successful collection, processing, storage and database management of multiple pediatric samples such as blood, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, sputum, saliva, tracheal aspirates, stool, and urine. Using this methodology, we enrolled 327 participants, who provided a total of 972 biospecimens. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric biospecimens will be key in answering questions relating to viral transmission by children, differences between pediatric and adult viral susceptibility and immune responses, the impact of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection on fetal development, and factors driving the Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children. The specimens in this biorepository will allow necessary comparative studies between children and adults, help determine the accuracy of current pediatric viral testing techniques, in addition to, understanding neonatal exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease abnormalities.

Apart from respiratory manifestations, neurological dysfunction in COVID-19 patients, especially the occurrence of cerebrovascular diseases (CVD), has been intensively investigated. In this review, the effects of COVID-19 infection on CVD were summarized as follows: (I) angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) may be involved in the attack on vascular endothelial cells by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), leading to endothelial damage and increased subintimal inflammation, which are followed by hemorrhage or thrombosis; (II) SARS-CoV-2 could alter the expression/activity of ACE2, consequently resulting in the disruption of renin-angiotensin system which is associated with the occurrence and progression of atherosclerosis; (III) upregulation of neutrophil extracellular traps has been detected in COVID-19 patients, which is closely associated with immunothrombosis; (IV) the inflammatory cascade induced by SARS-CoV-2 often leads to hypercoagulability and promotes the formation and progress of atherosclerosis; (V) antiphospholipid antibodies are also detected in plasma of some severe cases, which aggravate the thrombosis through the formation of immune complexes; (VI) hyperglycemia in COVID-19 patients may trigger CVD by increasing oxidative stress and blood viscosity; (VII) the COVID-19 outbreak is a global emergency and causes psychological stress, which could be a potential risk factor of CVD as coagulation, and fibrinolysis may be affected. In this review, we aimed to further our understanding of CVD-associated COVID-19 infection, which could improve the therapeutic outcomes of patients.

This expression can be controlled at various levels. This includes epigenetic regulation through DNA methylation or histone modifications. At the posttranscriptional level, regulation can be via alternative splicing or controlling messenger RNA (mRNA) stability. RNA cleavage is one way to control mRNA stability. For example, microRNA (miRNA)-induced mRNA cleavage has long been recognised in plants. RNA cleavage also appears to be widespread in other kingdoms of life, and it is now clear that mRNA cleavage plays critical functions in animals. Although miRNA-induced mRNA cleavage can occur in animals, it is not a widespread mechanism. Instead, mRNA cleavage can be induced by a range of other mechanisms, including by endogenous short inhibitory RNAs (endo-siRNAs), as well as the Ribonuclease III (RNase III) enzymes Drosha and Dicer. In addition, RNA cleavage induced by endo-siRNAs and PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) is important for genome defence against transposons. Moreover, several RNase has been identified as important antiviral mediators. In this review, we will discuss these various RNA endonucleolytic cleavage mechanisms utilised by animals to regulate the expression of genes and as a defence against retrotransposons and viral infection.","Gu, Karen; Mok, Lawrence; Chong, Mark M.W.",Heliyon,411,16

The “respiratory group” included 37 patients with respiratory symptoms at admission while the “nonrespiratory group” included 47 patients with no respiratory symptoms. The 84 nasal swabs collected included 54 that were considered positive (64.3%) and 70 viruses were detected. The most commonly detected virus was RSV (n = 28; 40.0% positive samples), followed by HRV (n = 24; 34.3%). Viruses were more frequently detected in the respiratory (86.5%) than in the nonrespiratory (42.6%) group (P < 0.001). Statistical analysis by subgroups revealed that RSV infections were significantly more frequent in the respiratory group (54.1%) than in the nonrespiratory group (6.4%) (P < 0.001). There was no difference for HRV (32.4% and 27.7%) or for the other viruses. No difference in duration of hospitalization or duration of mechanical ventilation was demonstrated depending on the virus detected. DISCUSSION: The use of the very sensitive multiplex PCR technique increased virus detection rates in both symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects. CONCLUSION: We have confirmed the frequency of RSV infections in a PICU and found that many patients without respiratory symptoms have respiratory infections caused by viruses. The impact of these infections on patient outcome should now be analyzed in order to demonstrate the role played by respiratory viruses.","Mortamet, G.; Morello, R.; Jokic, M.; Vabret, A.; Leroux, M.; Brouard, J.; Dina, J.",Arch Pediatr,411,12

Out of 225 eligible nursing homes, 74 (32.8%) completed the survey. Among 5891 residents, the incidence of confirmed or probable COVID-19 was 8.2% (95CI, 7.5% to 8.9%), and 22 (29.7%) facilities had an outbreak with at least 3 cases. Among the 4652 staff members, the incidence of confirmed or probable COVID-19 was 6.3% (95CI, 5.6% to 7.1%). A strong positive correlation existed between residents and staff members for both numbers of cases (r(2) = 0.77, p < 0.001) and the incidence (r(2) = 0.76, p < 0.001). In univariate analyses, cases among the staff were the only factor associated with the occurrence of an outbreak among residents (OR = 11.2 (95CI, 2.25 to 53.6)). In bivariate analysis, this relationship was not influenced by any nursing home characteristics, nor the action they implemented to mitigate the COVID-19 crisis. Staff members were, therefore, likely to be a source of contamination and spread of COVID-19 among nursing home residents during the first wave of the pandemic.","Piet, Emilie; Maillard, Alexis; Mallaval, Franck Olivier; Dusseau, Jean Yves; Galas-Haddad, Murielle; Ducki, Sébastien; Creton, Hélène; Lallemant, Marc; Forestier, Emmanuel; Gavazzi, Gaëtan; Delory, Tristan",J Clin Med,411,20

Many of the studies are from a quantitative perspective which has given a wider but general coverage of study and analysis on the matters. However, the impacts of context, such as living environments and social culture, on recycling activities from a qualitative as well as in-depth perspective have seldom been discussed, especially in densely populated communities. Taking Hong Kong as an example, some food waste recycling (FWR) initiatives have been launched in housing estates. However, most projects have been suspended due to many practical problems. Only a few cases are still on-going. Physical setting quality has been identified as a significant factor affecting sustainable behaviour. Inefficient and low-quality public designs that do not consider living environments and specific lifestyles may fail to encourage community participation. This study aims to provide a more in-depth investigation into people’s attitudes and actual behaviour towards and to shed light on public design for sustainability. Using the FWR programme in Amoy Gardens as a case, this study uses qualitative research methods to explore FWR experiences and improve its weaknesses. The findings show three potential challenges to FWR in densely populated high-rise buildings: (1) limited space, (2) hygiene issues and (3) implementation and management. This study also provides implications for public design to improve sustainability in communities and encourage public participation in FWR in high-density residential areas.","Xiao, Jia Xin; Siu, Kin Wai Michael",Resour Conserv Recycl,411,12

But most of these standards and indicators are for the assessment of individual aspects and what is worse, they are not suitable for the real situation of the countries concerned. This paper deals with methodological issues on the assessment of state economic strength. To this end, authors investigate the preceding studies on the assessment of economy of a given country, conceptualize the state economic strength, set a new system of indicators for assessing it and on this basis, produce a methodology for the synthetic assessment of state economic strength. The findings are that state economic strength must be defined in a view of economic capability which any country can exhibit by itself even under uncertain external environment, the indicators for assessing it include a variety of indicators in line with its essence, and assessment methodology must be synthetic one based on considering the weights of indicators. These findings may help, on the one hand, in assessing the economy of a given country and taking an economic and technical measures for its strengthening for policymakers, and on the other hand, in comparing and assessing the country-specific economy for organizations or scholars in a new perspective.","Rim, Gwang-Nam; Jang, Sun-Nam; An, Chol-Ju; Hwang, Sun-Hui; Ri, Son-Hui",Soc Indic Res,411,1

We conducted this study to investigate the outcomes of neonates born to mothers with COVID-19. Methods We searched the medical databases from inception to March 31, 2020 to perform a systematic review of outcomes in neonates born to mothers with COVID-19. Data were pooled using a random effects regression model. Primary and secondary outcomes were neonatal clinical outcomes and infectious status, respectively. Results Fourteen studies involving 105 neonates fulfilling the study criteria were identified. The rates of preterm neonates and those small for gestational age (SGA) were 25 (23.8%) and 10 (11.2%), respectively. Among 91 neonates who were tested, 8 (8.8%) were positive for nucleic acids or antibodies for SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, 28 (26.7%) of the neonates were symptomatic and two test-negative neonates died, including one stillbirth. Between test-positive and test-negative groups, the rates of SGA, preterm delivery, duration between maternal symptom onset and delivery, and perinatal complication were not significantly different; but the rate of symptomatic after birth reached significant difference (62.5% vs 20.5%, p=0.008). Conclusions Most neonates born to infected mothers had favorable outcomes. Although direct evidences of intrauterine infection were scarce, the risk of intrauterine infection should be considered based on a positive test in 8.8% of the neonates. Symptomatic neonates born to infected mothers should receive tests for SARS-CoV-2 to initiate appropriate treatment and quarantine. Further studies are warranted to assess the outcomes of COVID-19 in neonates.","Chi, Hsin; Chiu, Nan-Chang; Tai, Yu-Lin; Chang, Hung-Yang; Lin, Chao-Hsu; Sung, Yi-Hsiang; Tseng, Cheng-Yin; Yu-Min Liu, Lawrence; Lin, Chien-Yu","Journal of microbiology, immunology, and infection = Wei mian yu gan ran za zhi",411,1

The real burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection in West Africa is not clearly defined. The aim of the study was to evaluate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in half of the 3,380 workers of several mining companies operating in two mines in the Ivory Coast and having its headquarters in the economic capital Abidjan. Methods: From 15th July to 13th October 2020, a voluntary serological test campaign was performed in the 3 sites where the companies operate: two mines, and the headquarters in Abidjan.We performed a COVID-PRESTO rapid test for the detection of IgG and IgM on capillary blood. A multivariate analysis was performed to identify independent sociodemographic characteristics associated with a higher SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence rate. Results: A total of 1,687 subjects were tested. 91% were male (n= 1,536) and mean age was 37 years old. The overall crude seroprevalence rate was 25.1% (n=422), but differing significantly between different sites, rising from 13.6% (11.2%-16.1%) in mine A to 34.4% (31.1%-37.7%) in mine B and 34.7% (26.2%-43.2%) in Abidjan. Non-resident workers in mines had a significantly lower prevalence rate than those living full-time in mines. Seroprevalence was 26.5% in natives of the Ivory Coast, while people coming from countries other than Africa were less likely to be SARS-CoV-2 seropositive. Among the 422 positive subjects, 74 reported mild symptoms in the three previous months and one was hospitalized for a severe COVID-19 infection. Conclusion: The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among mine workers in Ivory Coast is high. The low morbidity observed has probably led to an underestimation of the burden of this infection in West Africa. The high prevalence reported in subjects living in Abidjan, who have not any close contact with mine workers, may be indicative of the real seroprevalence in the Ivory Coast capital.","Milleliri, J.- M.; Coulibaly, D.; Nyobe, B.; Rey, J.-L.; Lamontagne, F.; Hocqueloux, L.; Giache, S.; Valery, A.; prazuck, t.",,411,16

Due to the above-mentioned reasons, few experiments can be actually operated by students, which is not conducive to the chemistry learning and the phenomena principle understanding. Recently, due to the impact of Covid-19, many schools adopt online teaching, which is even more detrimental to students’ learning of chemistry. Fortunately, MR(mixed reality) technology provides us with the possibility of solving the safety issues and breaking the space-time constraints, while the theory of human needs (Maslow’s hierarchical needs) provides us with a way to design a comfortable and stimulant MR system with realistic visual presentation and interaction. The paper combines with the theory of human needs to propose a new needs model for virtual experiment. Based on this needs model, we design and develop a comprehensive MR system called MagicChem, which offers a robust 6-DoF interactive and illumination consistent experimental space with virtual-real occlusion, supporting realistic visual interaction, tangible interaction, gesture interaction with touching, voice interaction, temperature interaction, olfactory interaction and virtual human interaction. User study shows that MagicChem satisfies the needs model better than other MR experimental environments that partially meet the needs model.

This could be attributed to improved cycler design, apparent lifestyle benefits and the ability to achieve adequacy and ultrafiltration targets. However, the dilemma of choosing the superior modality between APD and Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD) has not yet been resolved. When it comes to fast transporters and assisted PD, APD is certainly considered the most suitable Peritoneal Dialysis (PD) modality. Improved patients’ compliance, lower intraperitoneal pressure and possibly lower incidence of peritonitis have been also associated with APD. However, concerns regarding increased cost, a more rapid decline in residual renal function, inadequate sodium removal and disturbed sleep are APD’s setbacks. Besides APD superiority over CAPD in fast transporters, the other medical advantages of APD still remain controversial. In any case, APD should be readily available for all patients starting PD and the most important indication for its implementation remains patient’s choice.","Roumeliotis, Athanasios; Roumeliotis, Stefanos; Leivaditis, Konstantinos; Salmas, Marios; Eleftheriadis, Theodoros; Liakopoulos, Vassilios",Int Urol Nephrol,411,1

Mass spectroscopy was used to measure proteolytic conversion of Ang peptide substrates to their specific peptide products. We compared ACE/ACE2 activity in plasma, brain and kidney from C57BL/6 and NEP (−/−) mice. Plasma or tissue extracts were incubated with Ang I or Ang II (1296 or 1045, m/z, respectively), and generated peptides were monitored with MS. Angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 activity was detected in kidney and brain, but not in plasma. Brain ACE2 activity was highest in hypothalamus. Angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 activity was inhibited by the specific ACE2 inhibitor, DX600 (10 μm, 99% inhibition), but not by the ACE inhibitor, captopril (10 μm). Both MS and colorimetric assays showed high ACE activity in plasma and kidney with low levels in brain. To extend these findings, ACE measurements were made in ACE overexpressing mice. Angiotensin‐converting enzyme four‐copy mice showed higher ACE activity in kidney and plasma with low levels in hypothalamus. In hypothalamus from NEP (−/−) mice, generation of Ang(1–7) from Ang I was decreased, suggesting a role for NEP in Ang metabolism. With Ang II as substrate, there was no difference between NEP (−/−) and wild‐type control mice, indicating that other enzymes may contribute to generation of Ang(1–7). The data suggest a predominant role of hypothalamic ACE2 in the processing of Ang II, in contrast to ACE, which is most active in plasma.","Elased, Khalid M.; Cunha, Tatiana Sousa; Marcondes, Fernanda Klein; Morris, Mariana",Exp Physiol,411,5

The International Farm Comparison Network (IFCN) Farm Simulation Approach and Technology Impact Policy Impact Calculations (TIPICAL) model was used considering with Corona (WC) and without Corona (WOC). The Integrated Dairy Research Network (IDRN) database (January 2019 to July 2020) was used for simulation of IFCN two typical farms. The milk price is decreased by 17% and feed price is increased by 3.7% due to COVID-19 in March which was used as the base for farm simulation. This resulted in a decrease in milk yield by 7.9% and 8.9% for small household and family farms, respectively. The cost of milk production increased by 19.10% and 10.9% for household and family farms, respectively. This has an overall negative impact on farm income which accounted for national economic loss from dairy farms in Bangladesh to 4.43 million USD/day (36.84 crore BDT). This loss has been fluctuated from April onward and was higher in June (3.83 million USD/day) due to a combination of COVID-19, flood, and seasonality effect on lowering milk production. At the same time, the farmers’ response to the resilience capacity (liquidity, operating profit margin, and financial performance) to combat COVID-19-induced situation has been declined substantially. Based on this, we conclude that the government might take a strategy to support farmers by providing financial support for increasing the operating capital and decreasing the cost of milk production.

Results: A sensitivity of 100% (95% CI: 86%-100%) was achieved in Covid-19 patients 14 days post symptom onset with dual sero-positivity to SARS-CoV-2 N and the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein. The specificity obtained with this algorithm was 100% (95% CI: 96%-100%). Antibody responses to ccCoVs N were abundantly high and did not correlate with those to SARS-CoV-2 N. Inclusion of additional SARS-CoV-2 proteins as well as separate assessment of immunoglobulin (Ig) classes M, A, and G allowed for explorative analyses regarding disease progression and course of antibody response. Conclusion: This newly developed SARS-CoV-2 multiplex serology assay achieved high sensitivity and specificity to determine SARS-CoV-2 sero-positivity. Its high throughput ability allows epidemiologic SARS-CoV-2 research in large population-based studies. Inclusion of additional pathogens into the panel as well as separate assessment of Ig isotypes will furthermore allow addressing research questions beyond SARS-CoV-2 sero-prevalence.","Butt, J.; Murugan, R.; Hippchen, T.; Olberg, S.; van Straaten, M.; Wardemann, H.; Stebbins, E.; Kraeusslich, H.-G.; Bartenschlager, R.; Brenner, H.; Laketa, V.; Schoettker, B.; Mueller, B.; Merle, U.; Waterboer, T.",,411,3

STUDY DESIGN: Using online searches, we collected state-level documents from all 50 states and the District of Columbia discussing reopening plans for K-12 schools in the 2020-2021 academic year. We examined whether these documents explicitly mentioned equity as a concern, as well as if and how they addressed the following equity issues: food insecurity and child nutrition, homelessness or temporary housing, lack of access to Internet/technology, students with disabilities or special needs, English language learners, students involved with or on the verge of involvement with the Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) or an equivalent agency, mental health support, students/staff at higher risk of severe illness from SARS-CoV-2 infection, and students/staff living with someone at higher risk of severe illness from SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Forty-four of 51 states (86%) explicitly mentioned equity as a concern or guiding principle. At least 90% of states offered guidance for 7 equity issues. Fewer than 75% states addressed homelessness or temporary housing, students involved with or on the verge of involvement with DCFS or an equivalent agency, and students/staff living with someone at higher risk of severe illness from SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSIONS: Wide variability exists in state-level guidance to help K-12 schools develop re-opening plans that protect those who are most vulnerable to learning loss or reduced access to basic needs. Interpretation and implementation by local educational agencies will need to be assessed.","Li, Alice; Harries, Michael; Ross, Lainie Friedman",J Pediatr,411,10

It has rapidly spread over 216 countries, including the USA, UK, Europe, Russia, and many Asian countries. It has affected more than 4.5 million people, and around 0.3 million deaths have been reported globally. Many preventive measures have been adopted worldwide to mitigate its spread. The government of Pakistan has also taken many preventive measures to combat the COVID-19 outbreak, such as rapid response by governance, continuous monitoring of the pandemic spread in the affected areas, and integration of resources from multiple sectors, including health, education, defense, and media. According to global statistics, the number of COVID-19 cases in the country remained remarkably lower than the expected number for the first 169 days, as compared to other countries. A total of 286,674 confirmed cases, including 16,475 active, 6,139 deaths, and 264,060 (92%) recoveries were reported. The study finds that strict adherence to national policies, effective governance, and unity at the national level resulted in better outcomes. Hence, the preventive measures, rapid responses, and strategies adopted for combating the challenges could be adopted as a learning tool for other countries having similar work environments and financial constraints. This paper can help and guide governance/public actions in response to the possible rebound of coronavirus this fall/winter.","Nawaz, Ahsan; Su, Xing; Barkat, Muhammad Qasim; Asghar, Sana; Asad, Ali; Basit, Farwa; Iqbal, Shahid; Zahoor, Hafiz; Raheel Shah, Syyed Adnan",Front Public Health,411,16

This descriptive study was performed with Ondokuz Mayıs University Medical Faculty students on 24–27 March, 2020. The Medical Faculty currently has 2051 students. A questionnaire was used as a data collection tool. For that purpose, the authors designed a questionnaire specifically for this research via the “Google Forms” web. This consisted of 40 open- and close-ended questions. The questionnaire was completed by 1375 (67.1%) students. Accordingly, 52.4% of medical students reported feeling mentally unwell. Although 50.8% of medical students reported generally/usually obtaining information about COVID-19 through the social media, 82.0% did not trust information/messages arriving through the social media and WhatsApp. We found that 86.7% of students regarded frequent hand washing as the most important means of protection against COVID-19, and 19.3% of students did not regard the COVID-19 pandemic as a severe public health problem for Turkey at that moment. In addition, 61.6% of students stated that a suppression strategy involving tight restrictions need to be applied to being the pandemic under control in Turkey. Use can be made of medical students in the transmission of accurate information during the COVID-19 pandemic. Students can be excellent activists on these subjects in countries in which medical education is suspended. Measures therefore need to be taken concerning the transmission of up to date and accurate information to medical students.","Aker, Servet; Mıdık, Özlem",J Community Health,411,1

Our study and other previous studies have shown that porcine IFN-λ more efficiently curtails the infection of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) in the intestine epithelia than type I IFN, whereas IFN-λ3 exerts a more potent effect than IFN-λ1. However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive, and in particular, the transcriptional profile induced by IFN-λ3 has not been reported. Here, to resolve the mechanism responsible for the disparity between IFN-λ3 and type I IFN in anti-mucosal virus infection, we compared the transcription profiles induced by the two IFNs in porcine intestinal epithelial (IPEC-J2) cells by RNA-Seq. Our results showed that the pretreatment of IPEC-J2 cells with IFN-λ3 resulted in the differential expression of 983 genes. In contrast, IFN-α only modified the expression of 134 genes, and 110 of these genes were also observed in the response to IFN-λ3. A transcriptional enrichment analysis indicated that IFN-λ3 or IFN-α regulates multiple cellular processes and that IFN-λ3 activates more robust signaling pathways, particularly the antiviral Jak-STAT signaling pathway, than IFN-α. Furthermore, we verified the RNA-Seq results through an RT-qPCR analysis of IPEC-J2 cells and porcine enteroids. Moreover, transient expression of the porcine rsad2 and mx2 genes among the top 10 genes induced by IFN-λ3 significantly inhibited PEDV infection. Collectively, the data showed that IFN-λ3 induces a unique transcriptional profile that does not completely overlap with that induced by IFN-α and strongly elicits a set of genes responsible for the antiviral activity of IFN-λ3. These findings provide important knowledge regarding the elicited ISGs of type I and III IFNs in restricting porcine intestinal viral infection.","Li, Liang; Xue, Mei; Fu, Fang; Yin, Lingdan; Feng, Li; Liu, Pinghuang",Front Immunol,411,21

One of the fundamental problems is the evaluation of the preparedness of countries to cope with COVID-19 pandemic crisis to detect factors associated with the reduction of infectious disease and rollout of vaccinations in society. The study here confronts this problem by developing two basic indexes, which measure the performance to face pandemic threats by countries. In particular, the Index r (as resilience) detects which countries have had the best performance to reduce the negative impact of mortality related to COVID-19 pandemic and the Index p (as preparedness and prevention) assesses best-performer countries to support COVID-19 vaccinations to constrain future pandemic threats and support the recovery of socioeconomic systems. Index of resilience is a composite measure based on three indicators, given by average mortality, hospital occupancy and Intensive Care Units occupancy per 100 000 people, producing an overall score; Index of prevention is also a composite measure of two indicators related COVID-19 vaccinations (doses of vaccines administrated and total vaccinates per 100 000 people), producing an overall score. The application of these indexes on a case study of European countries, having a homogenous socioeconomic area, shows strategic positioning of countries to cope with a major pandemic threat. Findings reveal that all countries have some weaknesses and no country has a high preparedness to cope with a major epidemic or pandemic. Moreover, results suggest that best-performer countries to cope with COVID-19 pandemic crisis have a smaller size of population and better public governance, associated with high expenditures in health system. These indexes can help policymakers for designing strategies to improve preparedness to face future pandemic threats.","Coccia, Mario",Environ Res,411,20

SETTING AND RESPONDENTS: Data are drawn from a population survey of individuals in the USA and UK conducted in June 2020. BACKGROUND METHODS: Regression models are estimated for 1467 individuals in which reported evidence of infection depends on work-related factors as well as a variety of personal controls. RESULTS: The following themes emerge from the analysis. First, a range of work-related factors are significant sources of variation in COVID-19 infection as indicated by self-reports of medical diagnosis or symptoms. This includes evidence about workplace types, consultation about safety and union membership. The partial effect of transport-related employment in regression models makes the chance of infection over three times more likely while in univariate analyses, transport-related work increases the risk of infection by over 40 times in the USA. Second, there is evidence that some home-related factors are significant predictors of infection, most notably the sharing of accommodation or a kitchen. Third, there is some evidence that behavioural factors and personal traits (including risk preference, extraversion and height) are also important. CONCLUSIONS: The paper concludes that predictors of transmission relate to work, transport, home and personal factors. Transport-related work settings are by far the greatest source of risk and so should be a focus of prevention policies. In addition, surveys of the sort developed in this paper are an important source of information on transmission pathways within the community.","Anand, Paul; Allen, Heidi L; Ferrer, Robert L; Gold, Natalie; Gonzales Martinez, Rolando Manuel; Kontopantelis, Evangelos; Krause, Melanie; Vergunst, Francis",J Epidemiol Community Health,411,21

Older age, male sex, comorbidities, ethnicity and socioeconomic factorsare risk factors for severe COVID-19. While the direct effect of solid cancer on the COVID-19 outcome has been investigated and is still debated, limited information is available on the impact of an underlying hematological malignancy on the risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2, the clinical presentation and the outcome of the infection. We report on the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a large cohort of patients (pts) with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Methods: We retrospectively investigated the exposure to SARS-CoV-2 through serological testing in a single centre cohort of CML pts. Of more than 600 pts on active follow-up, we have screened 161 pts between 1st June and 27th July 2020. At each consultation, we recorded any exposure to or symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the preceding 6 months. The Imperial Hybrid DABA, a two-step double antigen binding assay (DABA) for the detection and measurement of total antibody directed to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 was used for analysis. The cut-off (CO) for positivity is established by adding 0.1 to the average of optical density (OD) obtained for the negative controls. A sample-OD/cut-off (S/CO) value ≥ 1 is considered reactive. Results: 161 CML pts in chronic phase underwent serological testing (median age 54 years (18-92), male n=94). Twenty pts were off TKI (post-alloSCT, n=12; in treatment free remission n=6; pregnancy=1 and intolerance n=1) and 141 were on active treatment (imatinib [n=41], dasatinib [n=38], nilotinib [n=23], bosutinib [n=21], asciminib [n=11], ponatinib [n=6] and K0706 [n=1]). The ethnic distribution was White (n=119), Asian-Indian (n= 24), Asian-Chinese (n=3), Black (n=9), Arab (n=5), Mixed Asian-White (n=1). Eighteen pts (11.2%) have tested positive (Table 1). Thirty-eight pts (23.6%) reported symptoms compatible with COVID-19 of whom 12 (31.6%) were DABA positive. Six of 123 (4.9%) asymptomatic pts also tested positive. The time from onset of symptoms to the date of testing were similar in both seropositive (105 days, range 56-180) and seronegative pts (100 days, range 21-205). The median S/CO ratio was 9.9 (1-23.3) in the symptomatic and 1.5 (1.2-21.4) in the asymptomatic pts. Among the 18 positive pts, the median age at symptom presentation was 54 years (38-75) and 12 were males. The median time from CML diagnosis was 7.6 years (0.2-20) and two pts were post-alloSCT. Ethnicity was White, Asian-Indian, Black in 8 (44.4%), 6 (33%) and 4 (22.2%), respectively. In 15 pts (83.3%) symptoms were absent or mild, moderate in 2 and severe in one patient 2 years post-alloSCT on continuing immunosuppression for GvHD. Only 2/18 had PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 at the time of infection and both were positive. Of the 16 pts not tested for antigen, 2 had been in close contact with a family member with a PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the mild cases, the most frequent symptoms were fever (n=7) and cough (n=6), followed by fatigue (n=2), myalgia (n=2) and anosmia (n=2). One patient presented only with acute limb ischemia, derived from thrombus in the superficial femoral artery. One patient had radiological features of COVID-19 pneumonia, but did not require hospitalization. The only patient with severe COVID-19 developed pneumonia requiring CPAP, was refractory to tocilizumab (anti-IL6), but recovered after starting ruxolitinib (JAK2-inhibitor). The median time to complete resolution of symptoms was 21 days (7-56). Conclusions: The prevalence of infection in our CML pts is similar to that of the overall population, which suggests that they are capable of mounting appropriate antibody response against SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, in seropositive pts symptoms were mild. Of note is the higher prevalence in the BAME community and underlines the potential role of socioeconomic factors in disease transmission. Expansion of this CML cohort and serial antibody testing in seropositive patients will provide further information regarding prevalence and durability of serological responses.

We conducted a single-center study to describe respiratory mechanics and response to positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in COVID-19 ARDS and to compare COVID-19 patients to matched-control subjects with ARDS from other causes. METHODS: Thirty consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to an intensive care unit in Rome, Italy, and fulfilling moderate-to-severe ARDS criteria were enrolled within 24 h from endotracheal intubation. Gas exchange, respiratory mechanics, and ventilatory ratio were measured at PEEP of 15 and 5 cmH(2)O. A single-breath derecruitment maneuver was performed to assess recruitability. After 1:1 matching based on PaO(2)/FiO(2), FiO(2), PEEP, and tidal volume, COVID-19 patients were compared to subjects affected by ARDS of other etiologies who underwent the same procedures in a previous study. RESULTS: Thirty COVID-19 patients were successfully matched with 30 ARDS from other etiologies. At low PEEP, median [25th–75th percentiles] PaO(2)/FiO(2) in the two groups was 119 mmHg [101–142] and 116 mmHg [87–154]. Average compliance (41 ml/cmH(2)O [32–52] vs. 36 ml/cmH(2)O [27–42], p = 0.045) and ventilatory ratio (2.1 [1.7–2.3] vs. 1.6 [1.4–2.1], p = 0.032) were slightly higher in COVID-19 patients. Inter-individual variability (ratio of standard deviation to mean) of compliance was 36% in COVID-19 patients and 31% in other ARDS. In COVID-19 patients, PaO(2)/FiO(2) was linearly correlated with respiratory system compliance (r = 0.52 p = 0.003). High PEEP improved PaO(2)/FiO(2) in both cohorts, but more remarkably in COVID-19 patients (p = 0.005). Recruitability was not different between cohorts (p = 0.39) and was highly inter-individually variable (72% in COVID-19 patients and 64% in ARDS from other causes). In COVID-19 patients, recruitability was independent from oxygenation and respiratory mechanics changes due to PEEP. CONCLUSIONS: Early after establishment of mechanical ventilation, COVID-19 patients follow ARDS physiology, with compliance reduction related to the degree of hypoxemia, and inter-individually variable respiratory mechanics and recruitability. Physiological differences between ARDS from COVID-19 and other causes appear small.","Grieco, Domenico Luca; Bongiovanni, Filippo; Chen, Lu; Menga, Luca S.; Cutuli, Salvatore Lucio; Pintaudi, Gabriele; Carelli, Simone; Michi, Teresa; Torrini, Flava; Lombardi, Gianmarco; Anzellotti, Gian Marco; De Pascale, Gennaro; Urbani, Andrea; Bocci, Maria Grazia; Tanzarella, Eloisa S.; Bello, Giuseppe; Dell’Anna, Antonio M.; Maggiore, Salvatore M.; Brochard, Laurent; Antonelli, Massimo",Crit Care,411,22

SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into host cells via an interaction between its Spike protein and the host cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Disruption of this interaction confers potent neutralization of viral entry, providing an avenue for vaccine design and for therapeutic antibodies. Here, we develop single-domain antibodies (nanobodies) that potently disrupt the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and ACE2. By screening a yeast surface-displayed library of synthetic nanobody sequences, we identified a panel of nanobodies that bind to multiple epitopes on Spike and block ACE2 interaction via two distinct mechanisms. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) revealed that one exceptionally stable nanobody, Nb6, binds Spike in a fully inactive conformation with its receptor binding domains (RBDs) locked into their inaccessible down-state, incapable of binding ACE2. Affinity maturation and structure-guided design of multivalency yielded a trivalent nanobody, mNb6-tri, with femtomolar affinity for SARS-CoV-2 Spike and picomolar neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 infection. mNb6-tri retains stability and function after aerosolization, lyophilization, and heat treatment. These properties may enable aerosol-mediated delivery of this potent neutralizer directly to the airway epithelia, promising to yield a widely deployable, patient-friendly prophylactic and/or early infection therapeutic agent to stem the worst pandemic in a century.","Schoof, Michael; Faust, Bryan; Saunders, Reuben A.; Sangwan, Smriti; Rezelj, Veronica; Hoppe, Nick; Boone, Morgane; Billesbølle, Christian B.; Puchades, Cristina; Azumaya, Caleigh M.; Kratochvil, Huong T.; Zimanyi, Marcell; Deshpande, Ishan; Liang, Jiahao; Dickinson, Sasha; Nguyen, Henry C.; Chio, Cynthia M.; Merz, Gregory E.; Thompson, Michael C.; Diwanji, Devan; Schaefer, Kaitlin; Anand, Aditya A.; Dobzinski, Niv; Zha, Beth Shoshana; Simoneau, Camille R.; Leon, Kristoffer; White, Kris M.; Chio, Un Seng; Gupta, Meghna; Jin, Mingliang; Li, Fei; Liu, Yanxin; Zhang, Kaihua; Bulkley, David; Sun, Ming; Smith, Amber M.; Rizo, Alexandrea N.; Moss, Frank; Brilot, Axel F.; Pourmal, Sergei; Trenker, Raphael; Pospiech, Thomas; Gupta, Sayan; Barsi-Rhyne, Benjamin; Belyy, Vladislav; Barile-Hill, Andrew W.; Nock, Silke; Liu, Yuwei; Krogan, Nevan J.; Ralston, Corie Y.; Swaney, Danielle L.; García-Sastre, Adolfo; Ott, Melanie; Vignuzzi, Marco; Walter, Peter; Manglik, Aashish",bioRxiv,411,28

The current study aims to explore COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among college students in South Carolina and examine how they weigh these factors according to their levels of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance (i.e., acceptance, hesitance, refusal). Methods: Online survey data were collected from 1062 college students in South Carolina between September and October 2020. Multivariate analysis of covariance was used to compare perceived importance of 12 factors affecting levels of vaccine acceptance, controlling for key demographic variables. Results: About 60.6% of the college students reported they would definitely or likely take COVID-19 vaccine when available. Duration of vaccine protection, vaccine accessibility, and authoritative advice (e.g., if vaccination is recommended by school, government, or doctors) were considered important among the acceptance group; Negative consequences of vaccination and vaccine characteristics (i.e., ways the vaccine will be administered, and where the vaccine is made) were considered important by the refusal group; The hesitance group considered the same factors important as the refusal group did but also considered duration of vaccine protection and recommendation by school or doctors important. Conclusion: Our findings suggest relatively low vaccine acceptance among college students in South Carolina and different factors that play a role in their vaccine uptake decision according to their levels of acceptance. Tailored vaccine promotion messages should address specific concerns among the refusal and hesitancy groups. School could play a positive role in vaccine campaign since the reluctancy group considered that recommendation by their school was important in their decision making. Health educators also need to pay particular attention to the refusal group who do not value duration of protection or authoritative advice as much as their counterparts in their vaccine decision making.","Tam, C.

A single-center experience,17.2765,9.122904,2020-07-09,"The purpose of the current study was to assess knowledge and attitudes about human papillomavirus (HPV) and HPV vaccination for oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) prevention in first-year through fourth-year dental students. Methods: In this cross-sectional quantitative study, surveys assessed knowledge and attitudes about HPV, HPV-related OPC, and HPV vaccination of incoming first-year dental students (D1), outgoing first- and second-year dental students (D1–D2), and outgoing third- and fourth-year dental students (D3–D4). After completing a 40-item pre-training knowledge and attitude assessment survey, a one-time, one-hour national HPV training session was conducted. An 8-item attitudinal post-survey was completed after training. Results: Of 173 participants (75.9% response rate), over 85% did not know that the rate of HPV is not highest among women in their 30s, and only 11% to 28% knew that smoking-associated OPC is more deadly than HPV-associated OPC. While participants overall expressed willingness to administer the HPV vaccine, the willingness of dental students to do so in their future practice tapered off progressively through dental school year categories (p < 0.001). Among outgoing D1–D4 students, the one-hour HPV training increased participants’ self-perceived ability to describe the burden of HPV disease, discuss the importance of HPV vaccination for cancer prevention, and provide needed HPV vaccination information to parents (all p ≤ 0.004). Conclusions: Understanding deficits in dental student knowledge and attitudes across the 4 years of dental school may help dental educators better understand the timing and content needed for effective HPV training in the dental school curriculum to reduce HPV-associated OPC prevalence.","Wright, Marjorie; Pazdernik, Vanessa; Luebbering, Corey; Davis, Joan M.",Vaccines (Basel),411,20

In 21st century urban planning, no longer are higher speeds always seen as the main objective. New goals are increasingly recognised as being more important: accessibility, liveability, economic vitality, child-friendliness, sustainability and health. The concept of ‘health’ in this book applies to human health, as well as economic health and environmental health. We explain how all of these types of health can be enhanced using the simple strategy of slowing city transport. A brief history of increases in transport speed is followed by a discussion of the evolution of the culture of speed in modern societies, to a level that can be compared to an addiction. An important aspect of the culture of speed is the story of motordom, the grouping of automobile clubs, car dealers and car manufacturers that began in the United States in the 1920s. A concerted campaign by motordom comprehensively dismissed the public’s negative views on speed. We then outline how, from the 1980s onwards, new thinking began to emerge about motorised city transport, in which the value of slowing it down became more widely discussed. We provide examples of various slow movements that have emerged since the 1980s. While some citizens and policy-makers may question (or even ridicule) the idea of slow movements, we reflect on where the ‘fast movement’ has taken us over the last 100 years. This chapter concludes with a preview of the chapters and parts of the book.","Tranter, Paul; Tolley, Rodney",Slow Cities,411,16

To investigate the specific role of T cells in recovery from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections, we studied rhesus macaques that were depleted of either CD4(+), CD8(+), or both T cell subsets prior to infection. Peak virus loads were similar in all groups, but the resolution of virus in the T cell-depleted animals was slightly delayed compared to that in controls. The T cell-depleted groups developed virus-neutralizing antibody responses and class switched to IgG. When reinfected 6 weeks later, the T cell-depleted animals showed anamnestic immune responses characterized by rapid induction of high-titer virus-neutralizing antibodies, faster control of virus loads, and reduced clinical signs. These results indicate that while T cells play a role in the recovery of rhesus macaques from acute SARS-CoV-2 infections, their depletion does not induce severe disease, and T cells do not account for the natural resistance of rhesus macaques to severe COVID-19. Neither primed CD4(+) nor CD8(+) T cells appeared critical for immunoglobulin class switching, the development of immunological memory, or protection from a second infection.","Hasenkrug, Kim J.; Feldmann, Friederike; Myers, Lara; Santiago, Mario L.; Guo, Kejun; Barrett, Bradley S.; Mickens, Kaylee L.; Carmody, Aaron; Okumura, Atsushi; Rao, Deepashri; Collins, Madison M.; Messer, Ronald J.; Lovaglio, Jamie; Shaia, Carl; Rosenke, Rebecca; van Doremalen, Neeltje; Clancy, Chad; Saturday, Greg; Hanley, Patrick; Smith, Brian J.; Meade-White, Kimberly; Shupert, W.

Up to date, the number of death in 2021 is more than that in 2020 globally. Here, we aimed to compare clinical characteristics of deceased patients and recovered patients, and analyze the risk factors of death to help reduce mortality of COVID-19. Methods: In this retrospective study, a total of 2719 COVID-19 patients were enrolled, including 109 deceased patients and 2610 recovered patients. Medical records of all patients were collected between February 4, 2020, and April 7, 2020. Clinical characteristics, laboratory indices, treatments, and deep-learning system- assessed lung lesion volumes were analyzed. The effect of different medications on survival time of fatal cases was also investigated. Results: The deceased patients were older (73 years versus 60 years) and had a male predominance. Nausea (10.1% versus 4.1%) and dyspnea (54.1% versus 39.2%) were more common in deceased patients. The proportion of patients with comorbidities in deceased patients was significantly higher than those in recovered patients. The median times from hospital admission to outcome in deceased patients and recovered patients were 9 days and 13 days, respectively. Patients with severe or critical COVID-19 were more frequent in deceased group. Leukocytosis (11.35×10(9)/L versus 5.60×10(9)/L) and lymphocytopenia (0.52×10(9)/L versus 1.58×10(9)/L) were shown in patients who died. The level of prothrombin time, activated partial prothrombin time, D-dimer, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, urea, creatinine, creatine kinase, glucose, brain natriuretic peptide, and inflammatory indicators were significantly higher in deceased patients than in recovered patients. The volumes of ground-glass, consolidation, total lesions and total lung in all patients were quantified. Complications were more common in deceased patients than in recovered patients; respiratory failure (57.8%), septic shock (36.7%), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (26.6%) were the most common complications in patients who died. Many treatments were more frequent in deceased patients, such as antibiotic therapy (88.1% versus 53.7%), glucocorticoid treatment (70.6% versus 11.0%), intravenous immunoglobin treatment (36.6% versus 4.9%), invasive mechanical ventilation (62.3% versus 3.8%). Antivirals, antibiotics, traditional Chinese medicines and glucocorticoid treatment may significantly increase the survival time of fatal cases. Quantitative computed tomography imaging results were correlated with biochemical markers. Conclusions: Most patients with fatal outcomes were more likely to have common comorbidities. The leading causes of death were respiratory failure and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure and septic shock were the most common serious complications. Antivirals, antibiotics, traditional Chinese medicines, and glucocorticoid treatment may prolong the survival time of deceased patients with COVID-19.","Li, Jingwen; Luo, Hu; Deng, Gang; Chang, Jinying; Qiu, Xiaoming; Liu, Chen; Qin, Bo",Int J Med Sci,411,16

This heterogeneity impedes the ability to compare results across studies. The Sedation Consortium on Endpoints and Procedures for Treatment, Education, and Research Recommendations convened a meeting of multidisciplinary experts to develop recommendations for key methodologic elements of sedation trials in the ICU to help guide academic and industry clinical investigators. DESIGN: A 2-day in-person meeting was held in Washington, DC, on March 28–29, 2019, followed by a three-round, online modified Delphi consensus process. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-six participants from academia, industry, and the Food and Drug Administration with expertise in relevant content areas, including two former ICU patients attended the in-person meeting, and the majority completed an online follow-up survey and participated in the modified Delphi process. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The final recommendations were iteratively refined based on the survey results, participants’ reactions to those results, summaries written by panel moderators, and a review of the meeting transcripts made from audio recordings. Fifteen recommendations were developed for study design and conduct, subject enrollment, outcomes, and measurement instruments. Consensus recommendations included obtaining input from ICU survivors and/or their families, ensuring adequate training for personnel using validated instruments for assessments of sedation, pain, and delirium in the ICU environment, and the need for methodological standardization. CONCLUSIONS: These recommendations are intended to assist researchers in the design, conduct, selection of endpoints, and reporting of clinical trials involving sedative medications and/or sedation protocols for adult ICU patients who require mechanical ventilation.

METHODS: A study period of twelve weeks following the introduction of the nationwide “lockdown period”, March 23(rd) – June 14(th), 2020 was identified and compared to the same time period in 2019 as a “baseline period”. A retrospective analysis of all emergency orthopaedic referrals and surgical procedures performed during these time frames was undertaken. All data was collected and screened using the ‘eTrauma’ management platform (Open Medical, UK). The study included data from a five NHS Foundation Trusts within North West London. A total of 6695 referrals were included for analysis. RESULTS: The total number of referrals received during the lockdown period fell by 35.3% (n=2631) compared to the same period in 2019 (n=4064). Falls remained proportionally the most common mechanism of injury across all age groups in both time periods. The proportion sports related injuries compared to the overall number of injuries fell significantly during the lockdown period (p<0.001), however, the proportion of pushbike related accidents increased significantly (p<0.001). The total number of operations performed during the lockdown period fell by 38.8% (n=1046) during lockdown (n=1732). The proportion of patients undergoing operative intervention for Neck of Femur (NOF) and ankle fractures remained similar during both study periods. A more non-operative approach was seen in the management of wrist fractures, with 41.4% of injuries undergoing an operation during the lockdown period compared to 58.6% at baseline (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the nationwide lockdown has led to a decrease in emergency orthopaedic referrals and procedure numbers. There has been a change in mechanism of injuries, with fewer sporting injuries, conversely, there has been an increase in the number of pushbike or scooter related injuries during the lockdown period. NOF fractures remained at similar levels to the previous year. There was a change in strategy for managing distal radius fractures with more fractures being treated non-operatively.","Sephton, B.M.; Mahapatra, P.; Shenouda, M.; Ferran, N.; Deierl, K.; Sinnett, T.; Somashekar, N.; Sarraf, K.M.; Nathwani, D.; Bhattacharya, R.",Injury,411,9

Longitudinal studies examining the intensity of fatigue and differentiating between physical and mental fatigue are lacking. OBJECTIVE Therefore, this study was conducted with the following objectives: (1) to assess the severity of fatigue over time in members of online long COVID peer support groups, and (2) to assess whether members of online long COVID peer support groups experience mental fatigue, physical fatigue or both. METHODS A two-wave web-based follow-up study was conducted in members of online long COVID peer support groups with a confirmed diagnosis approximately three and six months after the onset of infectious symptoms. Demographics, COVID-19 diagnosis, received healthcare (medical professions and/or allied healthcare professionals), fatigue (Checklist Individual Strength - subscale subjective fatigue, CIS-Fatigue; 8-56 points), and physical and mental fatigue (self-constructed questions; 3-21 points) were assessed. Higher scores indicate more severe fatigue. A CIS-Fatigue score ≥36 points was used to qualify patients as having severe fatigue. RESULTS 239 patients with PCR/CT confirmed COVID-19 (83% women; median [IQR] age: 50 [39-56] years; 59% no self-reported pre-existing comorbidities; 87% good self-reported health before COVID-19; 26% hospitalized during acute infection) completed the survey 10±2 and 23±2 weeks after onset of infectious symptoms, respectively T1 and T2. The vast majority of patients had severe fatigue at T1 and T2 (85% and 79%, respectively). No significant differences were found in the prevalence of normal, mild, and severe fatigue between T1 and T2 (P=.12). Median CIS-Fatigue was 48 [42-53] points at T1 and decreased from T1 to T2 (median change: -2 [-7 to 3] points, P<.001). At T1, a median physical fatigue of 19 [16-20] points and a median mental fatigue of 15 [10-17] points was reported, which was lower at T2 for physical but not for mental fatigue (median change: -1 [-3 to 0], P<.001; and 0 [-3 to 3] points, P=.52, respectively). At time of completing the follow-up survey, 81% and 69% of all patients had received care from at least one medical profession and allied healthcare professional, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Fatigue in members of online long COVID support groups with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis decreases from 10 to 23 weeks after onset of symptoms. Despite this, severe fatigue remains highly prevalent. Both physical and mental fatigue are present. It remains unclear whether and to what extent fatigue will resolve spontaneously on the longer term.

In this study, CRC screening key indicators, including the FIT(fecal immunochemical test) screening rate (or participation rate) and the rate of undergoing colonoscopy after positive FIT in 2019 and 2020, were surveyed in individual countries in the Asia-Pacific region. The impact of the pandemic on the effectiveness of CRC screening was simulated given different screening rates and colonoscopy rates and assuming the pandemic would persist or remain poorly controlled for a long period of time, using the empirical data from the Taiwanese program and the CRC natural history model. During the COVID-19 pandemic, most of the programs in this region were affected, but to different extents, which was largely influenced by the severity of the local pandemic. Most of the programs continued screening services in 2020, although a temporary pause occurred in some countries. The modeling study revealed that prolonged pauses of screening led to 6% lower effectiveness in reducing CRC mortality. Screening organizers should coordinate with health authorities to elaborate on addressing screening backlogs, setting priorities for screening, and applying modern technologies to overcome potential obstacles. Many novel approaches that were developed and applied during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as the risk-stratified approach that takes into account personal CRC risk and the local epidemic status, as well as new digital technologies, are expected to play important roles in CRC screening in the future.","Chiu, Han-Mo; Su, Chiu-Wen; Hsu, Weng-Feng; Jen, Grace Hsiao-Hsuan; Hsu, Chen-Yang; Chen, Sam Li-Sheng; Chen, Hsiu-Hsi",Prev Med,411,10

There has been an increased incidence of pneumomediastinum, a rare but potentially life-threatening complication during this pandemic. It may be spontaneous or secondary. Pneumomediastinum may be due to barotrauma, cytokine storm induced diffuse alveolar injury or direct viral infection of type I and type II pneumocytes. The presence of pneumomediastinum in COVID-19 patients may indicate extensive alveolar membrane destruction and those patients need close monitoring. There are no consensus guidelines in managing COVID-19 patients with pneumomediastinum. Higher mortality rates (70.58%) are reported in intubated COVID-19 patients with pneumomediastinum.

These antibodies can be elicited through immunization or passively transferred as therapeutics in the form of convalescent-phase sera or monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Potently neutralizing antibodies are expected to confer protection; however, it is unclear whether weakly neutralizing antibodies contribute to protection. Also, their mechanism of action in vivo is incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that 2B04, an antibody with an ultrapotent neutralizing activity (50% inhibitory concentration [IC50] of 0.04 µg/ml), protects hamsters against SARS-CoV-2 in a prophylactic and therapeutic infection model. Protection is associated with reduced weight loss and viral loads in nasal turbinates and lungs after challenge. MAb 2B04 also blocked aerosol transmission of the virus to naive contacts. We next examined three additional MAbs (2C02, 2C03, and 2E06), recognizing distinct epitopes within the receptor binding domain of spike protein that possess either minimal (2C02 and 2E06, IC50 > 20 µg/ml) or weak (2C03, IC50 of 5 µg/ml) virus neutralization capacity in vitro. Only 2C03 protected Syrian hamsters from weight loss and reduced lung viral load after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finally, we demonstrated that Fc-Fc receptor interactions were not required for protection when 2B04 and 2C03 were administered prophylactically. These findings inform the mechanism of protection and support the rational development of antibody-mediated protection against SARS-CoV-2 infections. IMPORTANCE The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has resulted in the loss of millions of lives. Safe and effective vaccines are considered the ultimate remedy for the global social and economic disruption caused by the pandemic. However, a thorough understanding of the immune correlates of protection against this virus is lacking. Here, we characterized four different monoclonal antibodies and evaluated their ability to prevent or treat SARS-CoV-2 infection in Syrian hamsters. These antibodies varied in their ability to neutralize the virus in vitro. Prophylactic administration of potent and weakly neutralizing antibodies protected against SARS-CoV-2 infection, and this effect was Fc receptor independent. The potent neutralizing antibody also had therapeutic efficacy and eliminated onward aerosol transmission. In contrast, minimally neutralizing antibodies provided no protection against infection with SARS-CoV-2 in Syrian hamsters. Combined, these studies highlight the significance of weakly neutralizing antibodies in the protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated disease.","Su, Wen; Sia, Sin Fun; Schmitz, Aaron J; Bricker, Traci L; Starr, Tyler N; Greaney, Allison J; Turner, Jackson S; Mohammed, Bassem M; Liu, Zhuoming; Choy, Ka Tim; Darling, Tamarand L; Joshi, Astha; Cheng, Ka Man; Wong, Alvina Y L; Harastani, Houda H; Nicholls, John M; Whelan, Sean P J; Bloom, Jesse D; Yen, Hui-Ling; Ellebedy, Ali H; Boon, Adrianus C M",mBio,411,33

DHIs can range from electronic medical records used by providers to mobile health apps used by consumers. DHIs involve complex interactions between user, technology and the healthcare team, posing challenges for implementation and evaluation. Theoretical or interpretive frameworks are crucial in providing researchers guidance and clarity on implementation or evaluation approaches; however, there is a lack of standardisation on which frameworks to use in which contexts. Our goal is to conduct a scoping review to identify frameworks to guide the implementation or evaluation of DHIs. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A scoping review will be conducted using methods outlined by the Joanna Briggs Institute reviewers' manual and will conform to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews. Studies will be included if they report on frameworks (ie, theoretical, interpretive, developmental) that are used to guide either implementation or evaluation of DHIs. Electronic databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsychINFO will be searched in addition to grey literature and reference lists of included studies. Citations and full text articles will be screened independently in Covidence after a reliability check among reviewers. We will use qualitative description to summarise findings and focus on how research objectives and type of DHIs are aligned with the frameworks used. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: We engaged an advisory panel of digital health knowledge users to provide input at strategic stages of the scoping review to enhance the relevance of findings and inform dissemination activities. Specifically, they will provide feedback on the eligibility criteria, data abstraction elements, interpretation of findings and assist in developing key messages for dissemination. This study does not require ethical review. Findings from review will support decision making when selecting appropriate frameworks to guide the implementation or evaluation of DHIs.","Soobiah, Charlene; Cooper, Madeline; Kishimoto, Vanessa; Bhatia, R Sacha; Scott, Ted; Maloney, Shelagh; Larsen, Darren; Wijeysundera, Harindra C; Zelmer, Jennifer; Gray, Carolyn Steele; Desveaux, Laura",BMJ Open,411,0

Sirtuins 1‐7 (SIRT1‐SIRT7) are a family of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide‐dependent deacetylases with remarkable abilities to promote longevity and counteract age‐related diseases. Sirtuin knockout and transgenic models have provided novel insights into the function and signaling of these proteins in bone homeostasis. Studies have revealed that sirtuins play a critical role in normal skeletal development and homeostasis through their direct action on bone cells and that their dysregulation might contribute to different bone diseases. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that mice treated with sirtuin agonists show protection against age‐related, postmenopausal, and immobilization‐induced osteoporosis. These findings suggest that sirtuins could be potential targets for the modulation of the imbalance in bone remodeling and treatment of osteoporosis and other bone disorders. The aim of this review was to provide a comprehensive updated review of the current knowledge on sirtuin biology, focusing specifically on their roles in bone homeostasis and osteoporosis, and potential pharmacological interventions targeting sirtuins for the treatment of osteoporosis.","Li, Qiangqiang; Cheng, Jack Chun‐yiu; Jiang, Qing; Lee, Wayne Yuk‐wai",Aging Cell,411,25

Preventive isolation and social distancing strategies have confronted families with a large number of different challenges. The current epidemic and quarantine restrictions have a verifiable influence on the emotional and social development of children and adolescents. During this ongoing situation children of parents, who already were mentally stressed, seem particularly at risk. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the role of maternal daily perceived stress on children’s mental health during the SARS-CoV-2-pandemic. METHODS: An online “SARS-CoV-2-pandemic survey” was developed to assess children’s mental health since the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. To describe maternal perceived everyday stress, data from a longitudinal survey was utilized. Our survey includes elements and versions of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and the Perceived Stress Scale. We furthermore collected socio-demographic data. Due to our limited dependent variables we applied Tobit models for estimation. RESULTS: We found a positive and significant effect of the maternal perceived everyday stress on children’s emotional problems during the pandemic. Furthermore, results provide empirical evidence for an increase of the children's hyperactivity level dependent on the mother’s perceived stress before the SARS-COV-2 crisis. We could not find significant effects for the relationship between mother’s perceived everyday stress and the children's behavioral problems.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate how individual and neighborhood characteristics, including the pervasiveness of neighborhood broadband internet subscription, are associated with engagement in telehealth among older adults with internet access. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we included 5117 community-living older adults aged ≥65 years, who participated in the 2017 National Health and Aging Trends Study with census tract–level data for participants’ places of residence from the American Community Survey. RESULTS: Of an estimated 35.3 million community-living older adults, 21.1 million (59.7%) were internet users, and of this group, more than one-third (35.8%) engaged in telehealth. In a multivariable regression model adjusted for individual- and neighborhood-level factors, age, education, income, and the pervasiveness of neighborhood broadband internet subscription were associated with engagement in telehealth, while race, health, county metropolitan status, and neighborhood social deprivation were not.

CONCLUSIONS: Neighborhood broadband internet stands out as a mutable characteristic that is consequential to engagement in telehealth.","Okoye, Safiyyah M; Mulcahy, John F; Fabius, Chanee D; Burgdorf, Julia G; Wolff, Jennifer L",J Med Internet Res,411,16

Although scholars have highlighted the importance of students' digital competence in improving digital informal learning (DIL), the mediating role of DIL between digital competence and academic engagement has remained ambiguous. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between students' digital competence and their academic engagement with the mediating role of DIL in the higher education context. This study used a descriptive correlational design, and the data were analyzed using structural equation modelling (SEM). The study sample included 308 students from Shiraz University, Iran. The results showed that digital competence positively and significantly correlated with students' DIL and their academic engagement. Furthermore, DIL, as the mediator variable, was found to mediate the relationship between students' digital competence and their academic engagement. Since higher education institutions have a key role in improving students' academic engagement, particularly in the COVID‐19 pandemic, academic administrators should pay more attention to students' digital competencies and provide them with efficient and user‐friendly DIL platforms that can increase their academic engagement.","Heidari, Elham; Mehrvarz, Mahboobe; Marzooghi, Rahmatallah; Stoyanov, Slavi",J Comput Assist Learn,411,9

Approximately 10% of all births are preterm with nearly one million children dying each year due to PTB. It remains the most common cause of death among children under five years of age. The numbers for stillbirth are no less shocking with 2.6 million babies stillborn each year. With minimal impact on the rate of these adverse birth outcomes over the past decade there is an urgent need to identify more effective interventions to tackle these problems. In this retrospective cohort study, we used whole-of-population data, to determine if maternal immunization during pregnancy against influenza and/or pertussis, is associated with a lower risk of PTB, delivering a small-for-gestational age (SGA) infant, developing preeclampsia or stillbirth. Women with a singleton pregnancy at 28 or more weeks’ gestation delivering in Victoria, Australia from July 2015 to December 2018 were included in the analysis. Log-binomial regression was used to measure the relationship between vaccination during pregnancy against influenza and against pertussis, with preterm birth, SGA, preeclampsia and stillbirth. Variables included in the adjusted model were maternal age, body mass index, first or subsequent birth, maternal Indigenous status, socio-economic quintile, smoking, public or private maternity care and metropolitan or rural location of the hospital. Women who received influenza vaccine were 75% less likely to have a stillbirth (aRR 025; 95% CI 0.20, 0.31), and 31% less likely to birth <37 weeks (aRR 0.69; 95% CI 0.66, 0.72). Women who received pertussis vaccine were 77% less likely to have a stillbirth (aOR 0.23; 95% CI 0.18, 0.28) and 32% less likely to birth <37 weeks gestation (aRR 0.68; 95% CI 0.66, 0.71). Vaccination also reduced the odds of small for gestational age by 13% and reduced the odds of pre-eclampsia when restricted to primiparous women. This association was seen over four different influenza seasons and independent of the time of year suggesting that any protective effect on obstetric outcomes afforded by maternal vaccination may not be due to a pathogen-specific response but rather due to pathogen-agnostic immune-modulatory effects.","Giles, Michelle L.; Davey, Mary-Ann; Wallace, Euan M.",Front Immunol,411,17

Vaccination can be a key approach to enhance immunogenicity and protection against pathogens in these vulnerable populations, who have a functionally distinct immune system compared to other age groups. More than 50% of the vaccine market is for pediatric use, yet to date vaccine development is often empiric and not tailored to molecular distinctions in innate and adaptive immune activation in early life. With modern vaccine development shifting from whole-cell based vaccines to subunit vaccines also comes the need for formulations that can elicit a CD8(+) T cell response when needed, for example, by promoting antigen cross-presentation. While our group and others have identified many cellular and molecular determinants of successful activation of antigen-presenting cells, B cells and CD4(+) T cells in early life, much less is known about the ontogeny of CD8(+) T cell induction. In this review, we summarize the literature pertaining to the frequency and phenotype of newborn and infant CD8(+) T cells, and any evidence of induction of CD8(+) T cells by currently licensed pediatric vaccine formulations. In addition, we review the molecular determinants of antigen cross-presentation on MHC I and successful CD8(+) T cell induction and discuss potential distinctions that can be made in children.

Methods We examined the association between sixteen treatments in four groups (steroids, antivirals, antibiotics and immunomodulators) and intubation or death. Data were obtained from patients that were admitted to an HM hospital with suspicion of COVID-19 until 24/04/2020, excluding unconfirmed diagnosis, those who were admitted before the epidemic started in Madrid, had an outcome that was not discharge or death or died within 24 hours of presentation. We compared outcomes between treated and untreated patients using propensity-score caliper matching. Results Of 2,307 patients in the dataset, 679 were excluded. Of the remaining 1,645 patients, 263 (16%) died and 311 (18.9%) died or were intubated. Except for hydroxychloroquine and prednisone, patients that were treated with any of the medications were more likely to go through an outcome of death or intubation at baseline. After propensity matching we found an association between treatment with hydroxychloroquine and prednisone and better outcomes (hazard ratios with 95% CI of 0.83 +- 0.06 and 0.85 +- 0.03). Results were similar in multiple sensitivity analyses. Conclusions In this multicenter study of patients admitted with COVID-19 hydroxychloroquine and prednisone administration was found to be associated with improved outcomes. Other treatments were associated with no effect or worse outcomes. Randomized, controlled trials of these medications in patients with COVID-19 are needed to avoid heavy administration of treatments with no strong evidence to support them.","Bernaola, N.; Mena, R.; Bernaola, A.; Lara, A.; Carballo, C.; Larranaga, P.; Bielza, C.",,411,28

The symptoms of this disease are primarily due to pulmonary involvement, uncontrolled tissue inflammation, and inadequate immune response against the invader virus. Impaired interferon (IFN) production is one of the leading causes of the immune system’s inability to control the replication of the SARS-CoV-2. Mitochondria play an essential role in developing and maintaining innate cellular immunity and IFN production. Mitochondrial function is impaired during cellular stress, affecting cell bioenergy and innate immune responses. The mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), located in the outer membrane of mitochondria, is one of the key elements in engaging the innate immune system and interferon production. Transferring healthy mitochondria to the damaged cells by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is a proposed option for regenerative medicine and a viable treatment approach to many diseases. In addition to mitochondrial transport, these cells can regulate inflammation, repair the damaged tissue, and control the pathogenesis of COVID-19. The immune regulatory nature of MSCs dramatically reduces the probability of an immune rejection. In order to induce an appropriate immune response against the SARS-CoV-2, we hypothesize to donate mitochondria to the host cells of the virus. We consider MSCs as an appropriate biological carrier for mitochondria. Besides, enhancing the expression of MAVS protein in MSCs and promoting the expression of SARS-CoV-2 viral spike protein as a specific ligand for ACE2(+) cells will improve IFN production and innate immune responses in a targeted manner.","Babajani, Amirhesam; Hosseini-Monfared, Pooya; Abbaspour, Samin; Jamshidi, Elham; Niknejad, Hassan",Front Cell Dev Biol,411,16

Unlike influenza, most SARS-CoV-2-infected people do not transmit while a small percentage infect large numbers of people. We designed mathematical models which link observed viral loads with epidemiologic features of each virus, including distribution of transmissions attributed to each infected person and duration between symptom onset in the transmitter and secondarily infected person. We identify that people infected with SARS-CoV-2 or influenza can be highly contagious for less than 1 day, congruent with peak viral load. SARS-CoV-2 super-spreader events occur when an infected person is shedding at a very high viral load and has a high number of exposed contacts. The higher predisposition of SARS-CoV-2 toward super-spreading events cannot be attributed to additional weeks of shedding relative to influenza. Rather, a person infected with SARS-CoV-2 exposes more people within equivalent physical contact networks, likely due to aerosolization.","Goyal, Ashish; Reeves, Daniel B; Cardozo-Ojeda, E Fabian; Schiffer, Joshua T; Mayer, Bryan T",eLife (Cambridge),411,20

METHODS: Single center retrospective case series and survey study of patients presenting to a tertiary care Rhinology practice between 3/15/2020 and 6/1/2020. All patients had previous in-person encounters with Rhinology (n = 45). RESULTS: Twenty-nine participants (64.4%) had audio-video visits while 16 (35.6%) had audio visits. 36 (80%) patients stated that their needs were met during their telemedicine visit while 32 (71.1%) patients felt that nothing was missed or not addressed during the virtual visit.

The percentage of totally correct answers of COVID-19 knowledge in group C was higher than that in Group D (p < 0.001). There were significant differences between groups C and D in the attitudes and social responsiveness toward COVID-19. Surprisingly, we found that the idea of newly enrolled medical students could be easily affected by interventions. Conclusions: In light of this information, medical education should pay attention not only to the cultivation of professional knowledge and clinical skills but also to the positive interventions to better the comprehensive qualities including communicative abilities and empathy.","Yang, Haojun; Zheng, Yue; Yu, Fang; Cheng, Bohao; Zhu, Ziqing; Liao, Sheng; Chen, Yu; Wu, Jianzhen; Wang, Fang",Front Med (Lausanne),411,1

This review will examine the evidence for viral-induced exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive lung disease and the potential mechanisms by which viruses cause exacerbations. Attention will be focused on rhinovirus, the most common cause of respiratory exacerbations. Exacerbations due to rhinovirus, which infects relatively few cells in the airway and does not cause the cytotoxicity of other viruses such as influenza or respiratory syncytial virus, are particularly poorly understood. While the innate immune response likely plays a role in rhinovirus-induced exacerbations, its precise role, either adaptive or maladaptive, is debated. Because current treatment strategies are only partially effective, further research examining the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying viral-induced exacerbations of chronic airways diseases is warranted.","Hershenson, Marc B.",Scientifica (Cairo),411,1

A large student cohort took a completely virtual Radiology clerkship with daily programming including virtual small group teaching sessions or ""homerooms."" MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and eleven medical students were divided into 12 virtual small group sessions which emphasized foundational concepts. Uniform teaching materials were used across all homerooms in order to deepen understanding and allow insight into the working methods of radiologists. Students evaluated the homeroom learning and teachers for utility and benefit to their educational experience. RESULTS: Most students (93%) felt the homerooms provided an educational benefit and reinforced topics studied (77%). Most students (84%) felt the leaders created an environment conducive to learning. Despite being virtual, students were able to form interpersonal connections with the homeroom leaders. CONCLUSIONS: Incorporating virtual small group learning can be a valuable component of a virtual or hybrid Radiology clerkship, solidifying foundational concepts with the homeroom leaders playing a major role. While developed by necessity due to COVID-19, virtual small group learning with engaged leaders is an educational strategy whose benefit can continue even as there is return to in-person learning.","Goldenson, Robin Perlmutter; Avery, Laura L; Gill, Ritu R; Durfee, Sara M",Curr. probl. diagn. radiol,411,24

METHODS: The online survey, conducted on social media in May 2020, yielded 1393 responses across the country (66% from the Adriatic area). The questionnaire consisted of socio-demographic questions and questions on the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to PPE use. The χ(2) test, t test, and multivariate logistic regression were used in data analysis. RESULTS: As many as 84.0% of participants reported the compliance with social distancing measures, while 52.8% reported using PPE (mask and/or gloves) when shopping or visiting friends and family. Participants demonstrated good knowledge (mean of 10.4 [95% CI 10.3-10.4] correct answers out of 13 questions) and neutral to moderately positive attitude about PPE use (mean of 36.6 [36.1-37.1] out of 50 points). Participants with higher education, women, and health care workers had a greater probability for having a high knowledge score. Women, older individuals, public transport users, people with more positive PPE use attitude, and those who complied with social distancing had a higher probability of PPE use, while health care workers and highly educated participants had a reduced probability of PPE use in public. CONCLUSIONS: Croatians had good knowledge and neutral to moderately positive attitudes about PPE use. Nevertheless, health authorities need to promote positive attitudes about PPE use in order to retain trust and compliance with epidemiological measures.","Marendić, Mario; Bokan, Ivana; Buljan, Ivan; Dominiković, Paula; Suton, Ružica; Kolčić, Ivana",Croat Med J,411,1

Two principle kinds of RNA granules are conserved from yeast to mammals: stress granules (SGs), which contain stalled translation initiation complexes, and processing bodies (P-bodies, PBs), which are enriched with factors involved in RNA turnover. Since RNA granules are associated with silenced transcripts, viruses subvert RNA granule function for replicative advantages. This review, focusing on RNA viruses, discusses mechanisms that manipulate stress granules and P-bodies to promote synthesis of viral proteins. Three main themes have emerged for how viruses manipulate RNA granules; i) cleavage of key host factors, ii) control of PKR activation and iii) redirecting RNA granule components for new or parallel roles in viral reproduction, at the same time disrupting RNA granules. Viruses utilize one or more of these routes to achieve robust and productive infection.","Lloyd, Richard E.",Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: RNA,411,10

Viral infection can be identified in 24 % to 31.9 % of children, and in 13.3 % of adults. The three most frequent viruses are rhinovirus (RV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and parainfluenza viruses (PIV), detected in 8.8 %, 6.4 % and 6 % of cases, respectively. Due to its amplifying properties, the use of PCR increases the frequency of viral detection, and appears particularly appropriate in asthma where the viral load can be reduced. In a study of bronchiolitis, RSV, PIV3, AdV and RV were identified in 39.3 %, 4.3 %, 1.4 % and 3.9 % of cases, respectively, by IF or culture, and in 62.4 %, 8.3 %, 10.8 % and 12.6 % of cases, respectively, by PCR. Two recent epidemiological surveys used molecular diagnosis in asthma attacks. In a series of 61 adults, 27 (44 %) infections were identified: 16 RV, 4 CV OC43, 3 PIV, 1 RSV, 1 VI, 1 Chlamydia psitacci. In children, viral infection was detected in 226 cases (77 %) : 84 RV, 38 CV, 21 IV, 21 PIV, 12 RSV. We have performed a short retrospective survey for 1997, using molecular biology, on 39 nasal aspirates from children consulting for asthma or wheezing bronchitis. Testing for respiratory viruses by conventional techniques identified 8 (20.5 %) viral infections: 3 RV, 3 RSV, 1 IBV and 1 VPI2. After nucleic acid extraction, PCR-hybridization techniques were applied to these samples to detect RSV, AdV, RV, CV 229E, CV OC43, CP and MP sequences. Twenty six aspirates (54 %) were positive only on molecular biology techniques: 11 RSV, 12 RV, 2 enterovirus, 1 CV OC43. Overall 34 (82 %) viral infections were detected in these children, and a mixed RSV-RV infection was identified in 6 cases. Compared to the studies reported in the literature, we observed the same predominance of RV infections, more RSV infections, probably related to the use of PCR, and a lower incidence of CV infections.","Freymuth, F.; Vabret, A.; Brouard, J.; Duhamel, J.

This study explored the international literature on physical activity, sedentary behavior and well-being in adults with physical disabilities and/or chronic diseases during the first wave of the pandemic. Method: In a rapid review, we included studies reporting on physical activity, sedentary behavior and/or well-being in adults with physical disabilities and/or chronic diseases. Four databases (Pubmed, CINAHL, PsycInfo, Embase) were searched for studies published until 30 September 2020. Results: We included twenty-nine studies involving eleven different types of disabilities or health conditions from twenty-one different countries. Twenty-six studies reported on physical activity, of which one reported an increase during the COVID-19 pandemic, four studies reported no difference, and twenty-one studies reported a decrease. Thirteen studies reported a decline in well-being. Only one study measured sedentary behavior, reporting an increase. Conclusion: Despite the variety in methods used, almost all studies reported negative impacts on physical activity and well-being in people with physical disabilities and/or chronic disease during the first wave of the pandemic.

To better understand the comfort of outpatient workers in hospitals, clusters for preferences and perceptions of the indoor environmental quality (IEQ) and social comfort were identified in a previous study before the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This qualitative study explains the outpatient workers’ main preferences for comfort during the COVID-19 pandemic. Semi-structured interviews and photo-elicitation were used. Contextual changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic were included. The questions in the interviews were based on the characteristics of the profiles, corresponding with the clusters. The data were analyzed with content analysis according to the steps defined by Gioia. Seventeen outpatient workers who had been part of the previous study participated. For some outpatient workers differentiation of preferences was illogical due to interrelations and equal importance of the comfort aspects. The main changes in perceptions of comfort due to the pandemic were worries about the indoor air quality and impoverished interaction. Because the occupants’ preferences for comfort can change over time, it was suggested that further development of occupant profiles needs to accommodate changes.","Eijkelenboom, AnneMarie; Ortiz, Marco A.; Bluyssen, Philomena M.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,411,20

Taxonomy at the interface of conceptual and physical matters is by essence very controversial, but it is important for many purposes from virus diagnostics to virus evolution. Virus taxonomy, which officially began in 1966 under the activity of 43 virologists who created the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), has made tremendous progress in the last 40 years to classify today about 6000 virus entities into more than 2000 species, themselves classified into 287 genera, 73 families, and 3 orders, as attested by the Eighth Report of the ICTV. Virus nomenclature has also progressed in parallel to virus taxonomy, and although virologists still debate about the best way to write virus species names, undoubtedly virus taxonomy and nomenclature are now in a very advanced state. However, major challenges are ahead for virologists with the exponential increase in virus genome sequencing which will be beyond 1 million sequences by 2010 and the virologists have to face that challenge with organization and creativity, in order to offer to the virological community the best and most useful virus taxonomy and nomenclature.","Fauquet, C.M.",Encyclopedia of Virology,411,20

For the diagnosis of COVID-19, computed tomography has a prognostic role in the early diagnosis of COVID-19 as it provides both rapid and accurate results. This is crucial to assist clinicians in making decisions for rapid isolation and appropriate patient treatment. Therefore, many researchers have shown that the accuracy of COVID-19 patient detection from chest CT images using various deep learning systems is extremely optimistic. Deep learning networks such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) require substantial training data. One of the biggest problems for researchers is accessing a significant amount of training data. In this work, we combine methods such as segmentation, data augmentation and generative adversarial network (GAN) to increase the effectiveness of deep learning models. We propose a method that generates synthetic chest CT images using the GAN method from a limited number of CT images. We test the performance of experiments (with and without GAN) on internal and external dataset. When the CNN is trained on real images and synthetic images, a slight increase in accuracy and other results are observed in the internal dataset, but between [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] in the external dataset. It is promising according to the performance results that the proposed method will accelerate the detection of COVID-19 and lead to more robust systems.","Acar, Erdi; Şahin, Engin; Yılmaz, İhsan",Neural Comput Appl,411,30

This is a case study of the coordinated emergency healthcare response provided by the University of Pretoria’s Department of Family Medicine between 24 March and 6 April 2020. METHODS: This study uses a narrative approach to restory situated, transient, partial and provisional knowledge. Analysis is based on documented data and iteratively triangulated interviews on the operational experiences of selected healthcare first responders directly involved in the shelter. RESULTS: The impending lockdown generated intense interactions by UP-DFM to prepare for the provision of COVID-19 and essential generalist primary with partners involved in the Community Oriented Substance Use Programme (COSUP). With approximately 2000 people at the shelter at its peak, the numbers exceeded expectations. Throughout, while government officials tried to secure bedding, food and toilets, the shelter was poorly equipped and without onsite management. The COSUP clinical team prioritised opioid substitution therapy using methadone and COVID-19 screening over generalist healthcare to manage withdrawal and contain tension and anxiety. COSUP and its partners helped the city plan and implement the safe re-sheltering of all Caledonian residents. CONCLUSION: The Caledonian shelter is an account of organisational resilience in the face of homelessness and substance use emergencies triggered by lockdown. Through community-oriented, bottom-up self-organisation, a clinically led team navigated a response to the immediate needs of people who are homeless and/or use drugs that evolved into a more sustainable intervention. Key lessons learnt were the importance of communicating with people directly affected by emergencies, the value of using methadone to reduce harms during emergencies and the imperative of including OST in essential primary healthcare.","Marcus, Tessa S.; Heese, Jan; Scheibe, Andrew; Shelly, Shaun; Lalla, Sasha X.; Hugo, Jannie F.",Harm Reduct J,411,1

The large number of patients requiring intensive care threatens to overwhelm healthcare systems globally. Likewise, there is a compelling need for a COVID-19 disease severity test to prioritize care and resources for patients at elevated risk of mortality. Here, an integrated point-of-care COVID-19 Severity Score and clinical decision support system is presented using biomarker measurements of C-reactive protein (CRP), N-terminus pro B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), myoglobin (MYO), D-dimer, procalcitonin (PCT), creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB), and cardiac troponin I (cTnI). The COVID-19 Severity Score combines multiplex biomarker measurements and risk factors in a statistical learning algorithm to predict mortality. The COVID-19 Severity Score was trained and evaluated using data from 160 hospitalized COVID-19 patients from Wuhan, China. Our analysis finds that COVID-19 Severity Scores were significantly higher for the group that died versus the group that was discharged with median (interquartile range) scores of 59 (40–83) and 9 (6–17), respectively, and area under the curve of 0.94 (95% CI 0.89–0.99). These promising initial models pave the way for a point-of-care COVID-19 Severity Score system to impact patient care after further validation with externally collected clinical data.

But at least in the diplomatic literature, the importance of this regional dynamic (with a focus on diverse sites and actors and the pursuit of democratic control) has been missed. The objective of this article is to explore whether health diplomacy is catching up to this larger debate re-shaping the conceptualization and practice of diplomacy more generally. In some ways, the results may be counter-productive in that this shift may encourage an increasingly fragmented process. Yet, it may also point to some breakthroughs, with diplomats, acting as ‘go to’ personnel on the front lines of operational activity, enabling actors to integrate with one another to produce effective governance. In doing so, the regional dimension is given greater recognition as a component of health diplomacy, albeit in an uneven and sometimes awkward manner.

This study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and Quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) scoring systems at admission for the prediction of mortality risk in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We included 140 critically ill COVID-19 patients. Data on demographics, clinical characteristics, and laboratory findings at admission were used to calculate SOFA and qSOFA against the in-hospital outcomes (survival or death) that were ascertained from the medical records. The predictive accuracy of both scoring systems was evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: The area under the ROC curve for SOFA in predicting mortality was 0.890 (95% CI: 0.826–0.955), which was higher than that of qSOFA (0.742, 95% CI 0.657–0.816). An optimal cutoff of ≥3 for SOFA had sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 90.00%, 83.18%, 50.00%, and 97.80%, respectively.

The authors aimed to assess changes in the teaching and utilization of these modalities in pediatric dental residency programs. METHODS: The authors e-mailed a 29-question electronic survey regarding the utilization and teaching of nonsurgical caries management agents to US pediatric dentistry residency program directors. Data were compared with results from a similar survey conducted in 2015 to analyze trends, report protocols, barriers for utilization, and possible reasons for changes. RESULTS: Respondents from 82 programs completed the surveys (89% response rate). Although only 26% of respondents reported using SDF in 2015, 100% reported its utilization in 2020 (P < .001). The Hall-style crown technique is taught didactically in 90% of programs, and 69.5% of respondents use it at least sporadically in their clinics. Long wait times for the operating room (4 weeks-14 months) and sedation (1 week-12 months) motivate increased utilization of SDF, interim therapeutic restorations, and Hall-style crowns. Guidelines supporting off-label utilization of SDF have also resulted in its increased utilization. CONCLUSIONS: US pediatric residency programs have universally adopted SDF for caries arrest in the primary dentition, and this trend seems to extend to other nonsurgical caries management agents.

The synthetic steroids were completely characterized by one-dimensional and two-dimensional NMR and FABMS spectra. Sulfation was performed using triethylamine–sulfur trioxide complex in dimethylformamide as the sulfating agent. The sulfated steroids were comparatively evaluated for their inhibitory effect on the replication of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). Compounds 7 and 8 were the most effective in their inhibitory action against HSV-2. The disulfated steroid 8 also proved to be active against DEN-2 and JV.","Santos, Gustavo A.Garrido; Murray, Ana P.; Pujol, Carlos A.; Damonte, Elsa B.; Maier, Marta S.",Steroids,411,1

Adding to the complexity, some people believe the threat of COVID-19 is exaggerated. We used network analysis to investigate how these diverse elements are interrelated. METHODS: A population-representative sample of 3,075 American and Canadian adults completed an online survey, including measures of COVID-19-related worry, avoidance, self-protective behaviors, and other variables. RESULTS: The network contained three major hubs, replicated across gender and age groups. The most important hub centered around worries about the dangerousness of COVID-19, and formed the core of the previously identified COVID Stress Syndrome. The second most important hub, which was negatively correlated with the first hub, centered around the belief that the COVID-19 threat is exaggerated, and was associated with disregard for social distancing, poor hand hygiene, and anti-vaccination attitudes. The third most important hub, which was linked to the first hub, centered around COVID-19-related compulsive checking and reassurance-seeking, including self-protective behaviors such as panic buying and use of personal protective equipment. CONCLUSION: Network analysis showed how various forms of worry, avoidance, coping, and other variables are interrelated.

It focuses particularly on the assembly of two types of enveloped viruses: (1) the beta herpesvirus—human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), and (2) the primate lentiviruses—the simian and human immunodeficiency viruses (SIV and HIV). The chapter discusses the ways EM is used to identify morphological features of the various stages in the assembly of virus particles, to distinguish immature and mature particles, or to analyze steps involved in the acquisition of lipid membranes by enveloped viruses. In addition, it demonstrates the way immunolabeling allows the quantification of viral components, even in individual virus particles, and comparisons between particles at different locations in the cell or at different stages in viral assembly. Together with the newly developed methods for electron tomography and correlative immunofluorescence studies and EM, huge potential exists to unravel more details about virus assembly in the near future.","Pelchen‐Matthews, Annegret; Marsh, Mark",Methods Cell Biol,411,33

As for Hong Kong, one of the most densely populated cities, the scarcity of land has always been assumed as a major impediment for its long-term development. Therefore, the Hong Kong government actively explores approaches to enhance usable land resources. One viable approach is rock cavern development. This paper presents a feasibility assessment of relocating a sewage treatment works to a cavern, with emphasis on the evaluation of environmental sustainability. Wind tunnel tests were carried out with efforts to estimate the prospective odor impact, as well as the wind availability at pedestrian level. It is noted that the sewage odor concentration depends greatly on the dispersion distance and the surrounding topography. The results indicate that when the sewage treatment works is relocated to the cavern, the predicted odor concentration will not cause damage to human health as long as the ventilation shaft is properly placed. In addition, the air ventilation assessments were conducted for both before/after the planned building development. It shows that the new building development at the current plant site will not significantly influence the wind availability at pedestrian level in the surrounding areas. This paper highlights the importance of sustainable development in connection with the environment, and shows that rock cavern development can be an attractive alternative for strategic urban planning in Hong Kong.","Shu, Z.

In addition to investigating anosmia or hyposmia induced by this virus, the quantitative analysis was needed to clarify the taste and smell disorder of the new corona virus. The four basic taste quality with five concentrations for sweet, sour, bitter and salty were administered in to 75 subject divided in to three groups: COVID-19 patients with taste disorder, COVID-19 patients without taste disorder and control group. The results indicated the increment of sweet (2.68±0.14), sour (3.34±0.12) and bitter (3.39±0.2) thresholds in COVID-19 patients with taste disorder in comparison with patients without taste disorder that the threshold were: 2±0.16, 2.11±0.2 and 2.55±0.5 for sweet, sour and bitter respectively. On the other-hand the patients inversely showed significant decrease in salty taste threshold (0.51±0.03) compared to COVID-19 positive control groups (1.11±0.11). Additionally, despite taste disorder in almost all of patients with smell deficiency, only 30% of cases with taste disorder reported smell deficiency. It may be concluded that some of taste disorders in patients with COVID-19 disorder could be associated with taste receptors dysfunction or the spread of infection to the cranial nerves responsible for conduction of tastes sensation.","Asadi, M.

Infection swiftly disseminates to gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, renal organs as well as immune system to deregulate their normal functioning through unique and distinct mechanisms. The health system and economy has been intensely thwarted by the rapid spread and exorbitant mortality caused by COVID-19 disease across the globe. The acute progression of the disease and high infection rate pose an enormous challenge for its therapeutic management and critical care. The viral structure, genome and proteome have been deciphered which yielded cues for targeting already available therapeutic entities. More than 200 compounds have been screened and till date approximately 69 therapeutic agents are undergoing clinical trials across the world. Among these, remedesivir (RMD), chloroquine (CQ), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), noscapine (NOS) and heparin have demonstrated fairly promising results in preclinical and clinical studies. Recently, RMD has been approved by USFDA for the management of COVID 19. However, intense research is going on to screen and ace the ‘magic bullets’ for the management of SARS-CoV2 infection worldwide. The current review illustrates the plausible therapeutic targets in SARS-CoV2 important for inhibition of virus cycle. In addition, the role of RMD, CQ, HCQ, NOS and heparin in combating infection has been addressed. The importance of vitamin C and D supplements as adjunct therapies in the prevention of SARS-CoV2 virus infection have also been summarized.","Kumar, Mukesh; Madan, Jitender; Sodhi, Rupinder Kaur; Singh, Shashi Bala; Katyal, Anju",Biomed Pharmacother,411,1

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of the patient hospital records was performed, and recording only those with a microbiological diagnosis of pertussis infection detected using polymerase chain reaction, from January 2008 to December 2016. RESULTS: A total of 110 patients were identified, of which 105 (95.4%) were less than 6 months-old, and 59.1% were males. The annual incidence of hospital admissions was estimated between 13.7 to 425.0 cases per 100,000 infants <12 months old, with 2 peaks in 2011 and 2015. Household members were the main potential sources of infection. Main clinical features were pertussis cough associated with signs of catarrh, cyanosis, and lymphocytosis. Complications occurred in 15.4% of the patients (mainly pneumonia), but the outcome was favourable in all the cases. A lower age and non-vaccination were associated with an increased risk of developing complications (P<.05). Viral co-infection occurred in 31.6% of infants diagnosed with pertussis. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of pertussis has increased in the last years in Gran Canaria, with a lower development of complications and mortality rates compared with the previous period. Lower age and non-vaccination status are considered risk factors for developing complications. Vaccination in pregnant women will probably lead to a decline in the incidence in the future, especially in infants younger than 6 months.","Iglesias, Laura; Casabella Pernas, Antonio; Hernández Febles, Melisa; Colino Gil, Elena; Eisman Maraver, Alicia; Pena López, María José",An Pediatr (Barc),411,14

Six participants were recruited from ICATs located at two police constabularies. Data were gathered using semi-structured interviews and analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Findings indicated that the moral injury experienced by the participants was predominantly attributable to repeated exposure to traumatising images, with too little decompression time. Dysfunctional coping mechanisms, most commonly substance misuse, cognitive avoidance of distressing thoughts and emotional numbing, amplified the psychological and physical symptoms of anxiety. For many ICAT investigators, such tactics were attempts to manage the moral violations arising from their work and experienced as moral injury.

Machine learning algorithms represent a novel approach for the data-driven prediction of clinical outcomes with advantages over statistical modeling. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop a machine learning–based score—the Piacenza score—for 30-day mortality prediction in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: The study comprised 852 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, admitted to the Guglielmo da Saliceto Hospital in Italy from February to November 2020. Patients’ medical history, demographics, and clinical data were collected using an electronic health record. The overall patient data set was randomly split into derivation and test cohorts. The score was obtained through the naïve Bayes classifier and externally validated on 86 patients admitted to Centro Cardiologico Monzino (Italy) in February 2020. Using a forward-search algorithm, 6 features were identified: age, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio, temperature, previous stroke, and gender. The Brier index was used to evaluate the ability of the machine learning model to stratify and predict the observed outcomes. A user-friendly website was designed and developed to enable fast and easy use of the tool by physicians. Regarding the customization properties of the Piacenza score, we added a tailored version of the algorithm to the website, which enables an optimized computation of the mortality risk score for a patient when some of the variables used by the Piacenza score are not available. In this case, the naïve Bayes classifier is retrained over the same derivation cohort but using a different set of patient characteristics. We also compared the Piacenza score with the 4C score and with a naïve Bayes algorithm with 14 features chosen a priori. RESULTS: The Piacenza score exhibited an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.78 (95% CI 0.74-0.84, Brier score=0.19) in the internal validation cohort and 0.79 (95% CI 0.68-0.89, Brier score=0.16) in the external validation cohort, showing a comparable accuracy with respect to the 4C score and to the naïve Bayes model with a priori chosen features; this achieved an AUC of 0.78 (95% CI 0.73-0.83, Brier score=0.26) and 0.80 (95% CI 0.75-0.86, Brier score=0.17), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated that a customizable machine learning–based score with a purely data-driven selection of features is feasible and effective for the prediction of mortality among patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.","Halasz, Geza; Sperti, Michela; Villani, Matteo; Michelucci, Umberto; Agostoni, Piergiuseppe; Biagi, Andrea; Rossi, Luca; Botti, Andrea; Mari, Chiara; Maccarini, Marco; Pura, Filippo; Roveda, Loris; Nardecchia, Alessia; Mottola, Emanuele; Nolli, Massimo; Salvioni, Elisabetta; Mapelli, Massimo; Deriu, Marco Agostino; Piga, Dario; Piepoli, Massimo",J Med Internet Res,411,33

Characterization and optimal generation of AFSC-S remains challenging. We hypothesized that modulation of oxygen conditions during AFSC-S generation enriches SBF and confers enhanced regenerative and cardioprotective effects on cardiovascular cells. We collected secretome at 6-hourly intervals up to 30 h following incubation of AFSC in normoxic (21%O(2), nAFSC-S) and hypoxic (1%O(2), hAFSC-S) conditions. Proliferation of human adult cardiomyocytes (hCM) and umbilical cord endothelial cells (HUVEC) incubated with nAFSC-S or hAFSC-S were examined following culture in normoxia or hypoxia. Lower AFSC counts and richer protein content in AFSC-S were observed in hypoxia. Characterization of AFSC-S by multiplex immunoassay showed higher concentrations of pro-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory SBF. hCM demonstrated highest proliferation with 30h-hAFSC-S in hypoxic culture. The cardioprotective potential of concentrated 30h-hAFSC-S treatment was demonstrated in a myocardial ischemia–reperfusion injury mouse model by infarct size and cell apoptosis reduction and cell proliferation increase when compared to saline treatment controls. Thus, we project that hypoxic-generated AFSC-S, with higher pro-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory SBF, can be harnessed and refined for tailored regenerative applications in ischemic cardiovascular disease.","Kukumberg, Marek; Phermthai, Tatsanee; Wichitwiengrat, Suparat; Wang, Xiaoyuan; Arjunan, Subramanian; Chong, Suet Yen; Fong, Chui-Yee; Wang, Jiong-Wei; Rufaihah, Abdul Jalil; Mattar, Citra Nurfarah Zaini",Sci Rep,411,29

However, emerging online technologies cannot fully replace in-person scientific events. In-person meetings are not susceptible to poor Internet connectivity problems, and they provide novel opportunities for socialization, creating new collaborations and sharing ideas. To continue such activities, a hybrid model for scientific events could be a solution offering both in-person and virtual components. While participants can freely choose the mode of their participation, virtual meetings would most benefit those who cannot attend in-person due to the limitations. In-person portions of meetings should be organized with full consideration of prevention and safety strategies, including risk assessment and mitigation, venue and environmental sanitation, participant protection and disease prevention, and promoting the hybrid model.

We evaluated the association between mortality and demographics, co-morbidities, inpatient laboratory, and radiological parameters. RESULTS: : Among 181 critically ill mechanically ventilated African American patients treated at a safety net hospital, the mortality rate was 33%. On stratified analysis by race (Table 2), mortality rates were significantly higher in African Americans (39%) and Hispanics (26.3%), compared to Whites (18.9%).

In fact, in specific genes, ribosomes deviate from the standard translational rules in a programmed way, a phenomenon globally termed recoding. Translational recoding, which has been found in all domains of life, includes a group of events occurring during gene translation, namely stop codon readthrough, programmed ± 1 frameshifting, and ribosome bypassing. These events regulate protein expression at translational level and their mechanisms are well known and characterized in viruses, bacteria and eukaryotes. In this review we summarize the current state-of-the-art of recoding in the third domain of life. In Archaea, it was demonstrated and extensively studied that translational recoding regulates the decoding of the 21st and the 22nd amino acids selenocysteine and pyrrolysine, respectively, and only one case of programmed –1 frameshifting has been reported so far in Saccharolobus solfataricus P2. However, further putative events of translational recoding have been hypothesized in other archaeal species, but not extensively studied and confirmed yet. Although this phenomenon could have some implication for the physiology and adaptation of life in extreme environments, this field is still underexplored and genes whose expression could be regulated by recoding are still poorly characterized. The study of these recoding episodes in Archaea is urgently needed.","De Lise, Federica; Strazzulli, Andrea; Iacono, Roberta; Curci, Nicola; Di Fenza, Mauro; Maurelli, Luisa; Moracci, Marco; Cobucci-Ponzano, Beatrice",Front Microbiol,411,24

Due to movement of people from one city to other cities, one country to other countries, infection spreads and COVID-19 became a pandemic. Efforts were made at local, regional and national levels to lockdown the movement of people and to keep infected one in quarantine or isolation to stop the spread of COVID-19. The traffic, market and small industries were closed, as a result pronounced decline in the concentrations of particulate matters (PM) were observed. Normally these sources contribute to the high concentrations of particulate matters (PM2.5) which represents air quality of a location. In this short communication, we present analysis of PM2.5 of major cities (New York, Los Angeles, Zaragoza, Rome, Dubai, Delhi, Mumbai, Beijing and Shanghai) around the world suffered severely with the COVID-19. Our analysis shows decline in PM2.5 concentration due to lockdown, mainly due to less movement of people to keep “social distancing” to control the spread of CORONA-19. The low concentrations of PM2.5 reflect the efforts made in the cities to curb the spread of infection, that improve air quality.","Chauhan, Akshansha; Singh, Ramesh P.",Environ Res,411,1

However, evidences from basic to clinical research have contributed to depict a role of HDL in the modulation of immune-inflammatory response thus paving the road to investigate their involvement in other diseases beyond those related to the CV system. HDL-C levels and HDL composition are indeed altered in patients with autoimmune diseases and usually associated to disease severity. At molecular levels, HDL have been shown to modulate the anti-inflammatory potential of endothelial cells and, by controlling the amount of cellular cholesterol, to interfere with the signaling through plasma membrane lipid rafts in immune cells. These findings, coupled to observations acquired from subjects carrying mutations in genes related to HDL system, have helped to elucidate the contribution of HDL beyond cholesterol efflux thus posing HDL-based therapies as a compelling interventional approach to limit the inflammatory burden of immune-inflammatory diseases.","Bonacina, Fabrizia; Pirillo, Angela; Catapano, Alberico L.; Norata, Giuseppe D.",Cells,411,20

Many practices have been adopted by healthcare facilities to protect patients and staff by attempting to mitigate internal spread of the disease; however, these practices are highly variable among institutions, and it is difficult to identify which interventions are both practical and impactful. Our institution, for example, adopted the most rigorous infection control methods in an effort to keep patients and staff as safe as possible throughout the pandemic. This case report details the hospital courses of two trauma patients, both of whom tested negative for the COVID-19 virus multiple times prior to producing positive tests late in their hospital courses. The two patients share many common features including history of psychiatric illness, significant injuries, ICU stays, one-to-one observers, multiple consulting services, and a prolonged hospital course prior to discharge to a rehabilitation facility. Analysis of these hospital courses can help provide a better understanding of potential risk factors for acquisition of a nosocomial COVID-19 infection and insight into which measures may be most effective in preventing future occurrences.

In laboratory practice, such macromolecular crowding is typically mimicked by concentrated solutions of various polymers that serve as model “crowding agents”. Studies under these conditions revealed that macromolecular crowding might affect protein structure, folding, shape, conformational stability, binding of small molecules, enzymatic activity, protein-protein interactions, protein-nucleic acid interactions, and pathological aggregation. The goal of this review is to systematically analyze currently available experimental data on the variety of effects of macromolecular crowding on a protein molecule.

Résultats Concernant le terrain, les CPAVM étaient associés à moins de comorbidités (insuffisance cardiaque, et rénale chronique, cirrhose, prise d’immunosuppresseur) que les patients NCPAVM malgré un âge comparable. L’insuffisance cardiaque est associée de façon indépendante au NCPVAM (ORa=0,027 [0,004–0,214] ; p =0,001). Seul le surpoids est associé de façon indépendante au PVAM chez les patients COVID (ORa=3,14 [1,36–7,27] ; p =0,007). Des atteintes pulmonaires radiologique bilatérales étaient présente chez 40 (95 %) patients CPAVM contre 28 (34 %) patients NCPAVM (p <0,001). Les patients CPAVM étaient plus en état de choc (p <0,001) malgré un score de gravité initiale d’entrée en réanimation (IGS2) comparable. Les patients CPAVM ont présentés pour l’ensemble des 42 (100 %) patients un SDRA contre seulement 79 (58,5 %) des patients NCPAVM (p <0,001). L’évolution à j3 et j7 était significativement plus défavorable chez les patients CPAVM avec une évolution défavorable à j3 chez 35 (80 %) patients et j7 chez 35 (80 %). La mortalité à j28 de la première PAVM est similaire dans les deux groupes avec 21 (50 %) décès à j28 pour les patients CPAVM contre 80 (42 %) décès chez les patients NCPAVM. La durée moyenne de séjour est identique dans les deux groupes à 24 jours mais la mortalité en réanimation des patients CPAVM est significativement plus important avec 22 (52 %) patients décédés en réanimation contre 54 (30 %) pour les NCPAVM. Les CPAVM était significativement plus polymicrobienne (p =0,02) concernant 12 patients (28,6 %) et plus bactériémiantes (p <0,05) chez 11 (26 %) patients. Les bactéries identifiées au décours de la première CPAVM comprenaient principalement des entérobactéries (55 %) dans des proportions similaires au NCPAVM mais les CPAVM étaient plus fréquent à haemophilus chez 7 (16 %) patients (p =0,02), SAMS (p =0,03) et streptocoques (p =0,046) chez respectivement 7 (17 %) et 5 (12 %) patients. Les patients CPAVM étaient plus porteur de BMR à l’entrée avec 13 (31 %) contre 24 patients NCPAVM 24 (15,5 %) (p =0,04) alors que la prise d’antibiotiques dans les 3 mois était de 28 % pour les patients CPAVM.

Infection has spread quickly and renal transplant recipients receiving chronic immunosuppression have been considered a population at high risk of infection, complications and infection-related death. During this year a large amount of information from nationwide registries, multicentre and single-centre studies have been reported. The number of renal transplant patients diagnosed with COVID-19 was higher than in the general population, but the lower threshold for testing may have contributed to its better identification. Major complications such as acute kidney injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome were very frequent in renal transplant patients, with a high comorbidity burden, but further studies are needed to support that organ transplant recipients receiving chronic immunosuppression are more prone to develop these complications than the general population. Kidney transplant recipients experience a high mortality rate compared with the general population, especially during the very early post-transplant period. Despite the fact that some studies report more favourable outcomes in patients with a kidney transplant than in patients on the kidney waiting list, the higher mortality described in the very early post-transplant period would advise against performing a kidney transplant in areas where the spread of infection is high, especially in recipients >60 years of age. Management of transplant recipients has been challenging for clinicians and strategies such as less use of lymphocyte-depleting agents for new transplants or anti-metabolite withdrawal and calcineurin inhibitor reduction for transplant patients with COVID-19 are not based on high-quality evidence.","Toapanta, Néstor; Torres, Irina B; Sellarés, Joana; Chamoun, Betty; Serón, Daniel; Moreso, Francesc",Clin Kidney J,411,0

Early in 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a new name for the 2019-nCoV-caused disease: coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and declared COVID-19 to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Cellular co-infection is a critical determinant of viral fitness and infection outcomes and plays a crucial role in shaping the host immune response to infections. METHODS: In this study, 68 public next-generation sequencing data from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were retrieved from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive database using SRA-Toolkit. Data screening was performed using an alignment-free method based on k-mer mapping and extension, fastv. Taxonomic classification was performed using Kraken 2 on all reads containing one or more virus sequences other than SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 was identified in all except three patients. Influenza type A (H7N9) virus, human immunodeficiency virus, rhabdovirus, human metapneumovirus, Human adenovirus, Human herpesvirus 1, coronavirus NL63, parvovirus, simian virus 40, and hepatitis virus genomes sequences were detected in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.

Numerous issues for controlling infection have arisen from public discussion led by medical professionals. Yet understanding of these factors has been necessarily qualitative and control measures to correct unfavorable trends specific to an infection area have been lacking. The logical implement for control is a large scale stochastic model with countless parameters lacking robustness and requiring enormous data. This paper presents a remedy for this vexing problem by proposing an alternative approach. Machine learning has come to play a widely circulated role in the study of complex data in recent times. We demonstrate that when machine learning is employed together with the mechanistic framework of a mathematical model, there can be a considerably enhanced understanding of complex systems. A mathematical model describing the viral infection dynamics reveals two transmissibility parameters influenced by the management strategies in the area for the control of the current pandemic. Both parameters readily yield the peak infection rate and means for flattening the curve, which is correlated to different management strategies by employing machine learning, enabling comparison of different strategies and suggesting timely alterations. Treatment of population data with the model shows that restricted non-essential business closure, school closing and strictures on mass gathering influence the spread of infection. While a rational strategy for initiation of an economic reboot would call for a wider perspective of the local economics, the model can speculate on its timing based on the status of the infection as reflected by its potential for an unacceptably renewed viral onslaught.","Wang, Shiyan; Ramkrishna, Doraiswami",Sci Rep,411,22

Most of these findings were reported during the 2009 pandemic. The purpose of this study was to detail the clinical characteristics of influenza virus-induced lower respiratory infection (LRI) during the A(H1N1)pdm09-predominant 2015–2016 season. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical characteristics of influenza-induced LRI cases in children admitted to a tertiary children's hospital. Molecular diagnostic evaluation was performed on samples obtained from the most severe cases. RESULTS: We identified 66 patients with influenza-associated hospitalization and included 21 patients with influenza virus-induced LRI for analyses. Twelve patients (57%) were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit, seven (33%) required mechanical ventilation, and three (14%) required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Plastic bronchitis (PB) was identified in six patients (29%), among whom a past medical history of asthma or food allergy were noted in all six patients. A past history of allergic disease was more common among patients with, than among those without, PB (p = 0.009). A(H1N1)pdm09 was detected from all the PB cases, and phylogenetic analyses of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes demonstrated that this virus belonged to subclades 6B.1 and 6B.2. In the six PB cases, we found one patient with H275Y mutation in neuraminidase. CONCLUSION: Allergic disease was a risk factor for developing PB due to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection during the 2015–16 season.","Uda, Kazuhiro; Shoji, Kensuke; Koyama-Wakai, Chitose; Furuichi, Munehiro; Iwase, Noriyasu; Fujisaki, Seiichiro; Watanabe, Shinji; Miyairi, Isao",J Infect Chemother,411,16

The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019 was followed by a period of relative evolutionary stasis lasting about 11 months. Since late 2020, however, SARS-CoV-2 evolution has been characterized by the emergence of sets of mutations, in the context of ‘variants of concern’, that impact virus characteristics, including transmissibility and antigenicity, probably in response to the changing immune profile of the human population. There is emerging evidence of reduced neutralization of some SARS-CoV-2 variants by postvaccination serum; however, a greater understanding of correlates of protection is required to evaluate how this may impact vaccine effectiveness. Nonetheless, manufacturers are preparing platforms for a possible update of vaccine sequences, and it is crucial that surveillance of genetic and antigenic changes in the global virus population is done alongside experiments to elucidate the phenotypic impacts of mutations. In this Review, we summarize the literature on mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, the primary antigen, focusing on their impacts on antigenicity and contextualizing them in the protein structure, and discuss them in the context of observed mutation frequencies in global sequence datasets.","Harvey, William T.; Carabelli, Alessandro M.; Jackson, Ben; Gupta, Ravindra K.; Thomson, Emma C.; Harrison, Ewan M.; Ludden, Catherine; Reeve, Richard; Rambaut, Andrew; Peacock, Sharon J.; Robertson, David L.",Nat Rev Microbiol,411,20

Since early 2021 VOC/VOI are gradually dominating the SARS-CoV-2 virus pool in Cote d'Ivoire, as seen in other regions of the world. Intriguingly, we also find that another lineage, A.27, has also been on the rise over the same period. In sum, this study highlights again the extremely rapid local diffusion of VOC, VOI and possibly A.27, and the importance of further reinforcing capacities for genomic surveillance on the African continent.","Anoh, E.

Methods From March 16th 2020 to April 22th 2020, all outpatients scheduled for in-person cardiac evaluations were instead evaluated by phone. We aimed to report the short-term follow-up of 345 patients evaluated remotely and to compare it with a cohort of patients evaluated in-person during the same period in 2019. Results During a mean follow-up of 54±11 days, a significantly higher proportion of patients evaluated in-person in 2019 visited the emergency department or died for any cause (39/391, 10% versus 13/345 3.7%, p=0.001) and visited the emergency department for cardiovascular causes (19/391, 4.9% versus 7/345, 2.0%, p=0.04) compared to 2020. No cardiovascular death was recorded in the two periods. To an evaluation with a satisfaction questionnaire 49% of patients would like to continue using remote controls in addition to traditional ones. Conclusion These findings may have important implications for the management of patients during the current COVID-19 pandemic because they suggest that remote cardiovascular evaluations may replace in-hospital visits for a limited period.","Maines, Massimiliano; Zorzi, Alessandro; Paolo Benetollo, Pier; Maria Guarrera, Giovanni; Moz, Monica; Manica, Anna; Cristina, Demattè; Del Greco, Maurizio",Int J Cardiol Heart Vasc,411,1

To date, there is a lack of findings on the role of rehabilitation in postacute COVID-19 patients. AIM: Thus, we aimed at describing the role of a patient-tailored rehabilitation plan on functional outcome in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. DESIGN: Real-practice retrospective study. SETTING: Inpatients Rehabilitation Unit. POPULATION: Postacute COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Medical records of patients referred to an Italian COVID-19 Rehabilitation Unit from March 10th, 2020 to April 30th, 2020 were collected. All patients underwent a rehabilitative (30 minutes/set, 2 times/day), aimed to improve gas exchanges, reducing dyspnoea, and improving muscle function. At the admission (T0) and at the discharge (T1), we evaluated as outcome measures: Barthel Index (BI), modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale, 6-Minute Walking Test (6-MWT) and Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale. We also assessed: type of respiratory supports needed, pulmonary function, coagulation and inflammation markers and length of stay (LOS) in Rehabilitation Unit. RESULTS: We included 41 postacute COVID-19 patients (25 male and 19 female), mean aged 72.15±11.07 years. Their mean LOS in the Rehabilitation Unit was 31.97±9.06 days, as 39 successfully completed the rehabilitation treatment and 2 deceased. We found statistically significant improvement in BI (84.87±15.56 vs. 43.37±26.00; P<0.0001), 6-MWT (303.37±112.18 vs. 240.0±81.31 meters; P=0.028), Borg RPE scale (12.23±2.51 vs. 16.03±2.28; P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that postacute COVID-19 patients might beneficiate of a motor and respiratory rehabilitation treatment. However, further studies are advised to better understand long-term sequelae of the disease. CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: This study provides evidence on the role of rehabilitation COVID-19 postacute inpatients through a patient-tailored treatment.","Curci, Claudio; Negrini, Francesco; Ferrillo, Martina; Bergonzi, Roberto; Bonacci, Eleonora; Camozzi, Danila M; Ceravolo, Claudia; DE Franceschi, Silvia; Guarnieri, Rodolfo; Moro, Paolo; Pisano, Fabrizio; de Sire, Alessandro",Eur J Phys Rehabil Med,411,16

Early reports of hospitalised COVID-19 cases have shown relatively low frequency of chronic lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) but increased risk of adverse outcome. The mechanisms of altered susceptibility to viral acquisition and/or severe disease in at-risk groups are poorly understood. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are widely used in the treatment of COPD but the extent to which these therapies protect or expose patients with a COPD to risk of increased COVID-19 severity is unknown. Here, using a combination of human and animal in vitro and in vivo disease models, we show that ICS administration attenuates pulmonary expression of the SARS-CoV-2 viral entry receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2. This effect was mechanistically driven by suppression of type I interferon as exogenous interferon-β reversed ACE2 downregulation by ICS. Mice deficient in the type I interferon-α/β receptor (Ifnar1−/−) also had reduced expression of ACE2. Collectively, these data suggest that use of ICS therapies in COPD reduces expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 and this effect may thus contribute to altered susceptibility to COVID-19 in patients with COPD.","Finney, Lydia J; Glanville, Nicholas; Farne, Hugo; Aniscenko, Julia; Fenwick, Peter; Kemp, Samuel V; Trujillo-Torralbo, Maria-Belen; Calderazzo, Maria Adelaide; Wedzicha, Jadwiga A; Mallia, Patrick; Bartlett, Nathan W; Johnston, Sebastian L; Singanayagam, Aran",bioRxiv,411,33

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study on clinical features of adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 between March 1st and April 30th, 2020 in the district of Piacenza (Italy). RESULTS: Among 1894 hospitalized patients, 1701 affected by COVID-19 underwent at least two serum creatinine evaluations. According to KDIGO definitions, 233 of 1,701 patients (13.7%) developed AKI: 159, 34, and 40 had stage 1, 2 and 3 AKI, respectively. Patients with AKI were older (mean age 73.5 ± 14 years, range 24–95) than those without AKI (72 ± 14 years, range 20–102). In-hospital mortality was high in COVID patients (567/1701 patients, 33%), which almost doubled among AKI patients (132/233 patients, 57%), compared with those without AKI (p < 0.01). Risk factors for AKI included older age, male gender, diabetes and need for ventilation. Fourteen patients with stage 3 AKI underwent renal replacement therapy (RRT). CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized COVID-19 patients with AKI associated with ARF have poor chances of survival. Diagnosing and preventing the progression of renal damage is fundamental in order to delay initiating RRT, especially when resources are limited.","Scarpioni, Roberto; Valsania, Teresa; Albertazzi, Vittorio; Blanco, Valentina; DeAmicis, Sara; Manini, Alessandra; Melfa, Luigi; Ricardi, Marco; Rocca, Chiara; Gandolfi, Stefano",J Nephrol,411,0

In large auditoria for multipurpose functions are becoming a common request to use the space for different activities such as conferences, concerts of classical and amplified music, shows, etc. and the necessity to find architectural solutions in order to consider the variable acoustic demands according to different possible layouts, are growing. In this paper, as a case study, architectural acoustic design approaches and solutions for a circular auditorium are presented. The case study was made in “Le Serre” hall for 1000 people, in the Villa Erba Convention Center, located in Cernobbio (Italy), in which different combinations of movable architectural elements are developed to create a multipurpose space. A geometrical acoustic analyses are included, followed by the description of different methods to avoid focusing and whispering.

The hotspot lysine sites that are crucial to the SARS-CoV-2 S1–ACE2 combination could be successfully probed, such as S1 Lys(417) and Lys(444). Significant alteration of the reactivities of lysine residues at the interaction interface of S1-RBD Lys(386)–Lys(462) was observed during the formation of complexes, which might be utilized as indicators for investigating the S1-ACE2 dynamic recognition and intervention at the molecular level in high throughput.","Liu, Zheyi; Zhang, Wenxiang; Sun, Binwen; Ma, Yaolu; He, Min; Pan, Yuanjiang; Wang, Fangjun",Chemical Science,411,5

Methods All consecutive patients admitted, from February 25 to April 25, 2020, to the Infectious Diseases Unit and Intensive Care Unit of Santa Maria Annunziata Hospital (Florence, Italy) with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis were enrolled in this retrospective cohort study. NI/I-VS was defined as need for continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel positive pressure non-invasive ventilation (BPAP) or mechanical ventilation (MV) than low-flow systems oxygen-therapy as Venturi Mask (VM) or nasal cannula. Results Ninety-seven patients were enrolled; 61,9% (60/97) were male, median age was 64 years; intra-hospital mortality was 9.3%. Thirty five out of 97 (36%) patients required ICU admission and 94.8% (92/97) were prescribed oxygen-therapy: 10.8% (10/92) with nasal cannula, 44.5% (41/92) with VM, 31.5% (29/92) with CPAP, 2.2% (2/92) with BPAP and 10.8% (10/92) underwent intubation for MV. Patients with body mass index >30, type II diabetes mellitus and presenting at the admission with dyspnoea, asthenia, SOFA score ≥2 points, PaO2/FiO2 < 300, temperature >38 °C, increased levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alanine aminotransferase, C-reactive protein and a d-dimer >1000 ng/ml underwent more frequently NI/I-VS at the univariate analysis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis confirmed temperature >38 °C (odds ratio [OR] 21.2, 95% confidential interval [95%CI] 3.5-124.5, p = 0.001), LDH > 250 U/L (OR 15.2, 95%CI 1.8-128.8, p = 0.012) and d-dimer >1000 ng/ml (OR 4.5, 95%CI 1.2-17.3, p = 0.027) as significantly associated with NI/I-VS requirement. A non-significant trend (p = 0.051) was described for PaO2/FiO2 < 300. Conclusions Temperature >38 °C, LDH > 250 U/L and d-dimer >1000 ng/ml resulted to be indipendent risk factors for NI/I-VS in COVID-19 patients. In order to quickly recognize patients likely at risk to develop a critical illness, inflammatory markers assessment should be warranted upon hospital admission.","Suardi, Lorenzo Roberto; Pallotto, Carlo; Esperti, Sara; Tazzioli, Elisa; Baragli, Filippo; Salomoni, Elena; Botta, Annarita; Covani Frigieri, Francesca; Pazzi, Maddalena; Stera, Caterina; Carlucci, Martina; Papa, Raffaella; Meconi, Tommaso; Pavoni, Vittorio; Blanc, Pierluigi",Int J Infect Dis,411,9
