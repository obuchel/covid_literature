1398,1398,1398,Intentions to Perform Non-Pharmaceutical Protective Behaviors during Influenza Outbreaks in Sweden: A Cross-Sectional Study following a Mass Vaccination Campaign,20.720423,6.3095913,2014-03-07,"Failure to incorporate the beliefs and attitudes of the public into theoretical models of preparedness has been identified as a weakness in strategies to mitigate infectious disease outbreaks. We administered a cross-sectional telephone survey to a representative sample (n = 443) of the Swedish adult population to examine whether self-reported intentions to improve personal hygiene and increase social distancing during influenza outbreaks could be explained by trust in official information, self-reported health (SF-8), sociodemographic factors, and determinants postulated in protection motivation theory, namely threat appraisal and coping appraisal. The interviewees were asked to make their appraisals for two scenarios: a) an influenza with low case fatality and mild lifestyle impact; b) severe influenza with high case fatality and serious disturbances of societal functions. Every second respondent (50.0%) reported high trust in official information about influenza. The proportion that reported intentions to take deliberate actions to improve personal hygiene during outbreaks ranged between 45–85%, while less than 25% said that they intended to increase social distancing. Multiple logistic regression models with coping appraisal as the explanatory factor most frequently contributing to the explanation of the variance in intentions showed strong discriminatory performance for staying home while not ill (mild outbreaks: Area under the curve [AUC] 0.85 (95% confidence interval 0.82;0.89), severe outbreaks AUC 0.82 (95% CI 0.77;0.85)) and acceptable performance with regard to avoiding public transportation (AUC 0.78 (0.74;0.82), AUC 0.77 (0.72;0.82)), using handwash products (AUC 0.70 (0.65;0.75), AUC 0.76 (0.71;0.80)), and frequently washing hands (AUC 0.71 (0.66;0.76), AUC 0.75 (0.71;0.80)). We conclude that coping appraisal was the explanatory factor most frequently included in statistical models explaining self-reported intentions to carry out non-pharmaceutical health actions in the Swedish outlined context, and that variations in threat appraisal played a smaller role in these models despite scientific uncertainties surrounding a recent mass vaccination campaign.","Timpka, Toomas; Spreco, Armin; Gursky, Elin; Eriksson, Olle; Dahlström, Örjan; Strömgren, Magnus; Ekberg, Joakim; Pilemalm, Sofie; Karlsson, David; Hinkula, Jorma; Holm, Einar",PLoS One,292,17

Dengue is now endemic in Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is at risk for Zika, another emerging arbovirus. The interrelationship between climatic, ecological, social, and cultural factors that affect dengue and other arboviruses' transmission is understudied. DESIGN: The objective of this systematic review is to examine the interrelationship between climatic, ecological, social, and cultural factors on dengue transmission in Puerto Rico and to draw lessons for Zika response. RESULTS: A comprehensive search of peer-reviewed journal articles was performed, producing 562 articles; 26 were selected for this review. Findings indicate that human activities and behaviors (urbanization, migration, and consumption) as well as climate have a significant impact on the abundance and the transmission potential of Ae. aegypti, the vector for dengue, Zika, and other viruses. CONCLUSION: Despite the public health burden of dengue limited investments have been made in research and surveillance. Future research is needed to develop models that integrate the multivariate effects of climatic, ecological, social, and cultural factors, which for Puerto Rico have mostly been examined independently. Such models have the potential to inform response to dengue, Zika, and other arboviruses.","Matysiak, Angela; Roess, Amira",J Trop Med,292,22

However, few studies have examined the influence of social support, comorbidity, and pain interference on ICU survivors’ HRQOL. OBJECTIVES: To investigate possible associations between social support, number of comorbidities, and pain interference on HRQOL in ICU survivors. METHODS: ICU survivors responded to a survey 3 months (n = 118) and 1 year (n = 89) after ICU discharge. HRQOL was measured using the Short Form Health Survey-12 (v1), social support using the revised Social Provision Scale, pain interference using the Brief Pain Inventory–Short Form, and comorbidities using the Self-Administered Comorbidity Questionnaire. RESULTS: Physical and mental HRQOL were reduced at both 3 months and 1 year in ICU survivors compared with the general population. This reduction was more pronounced at 3 months for physical HRQOL, while a small reduction in mental HRQOL was not clinically relevant. Social support was statistical significantly positively associated with mental HRQOL at 3 months, while number of comorbidities was statistical significantly associated with a reduction in physical HRQOL at 3 months and 1 year and mental HRQOL at 1 year. Lastly pain interference was significantly associated with a reduction in physical HRQOL at 3 months and 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: ICU survivors primarily report reduced physical HRQOL. Social support was positively associated with mental HRQOL, while number of comorbidities, and pain interference were all significantly associated with a reduction in HRQOL. Pain interference was associated with the largest reduction in HRQOL.","Langerud, Anne Kathrine; Rustøen, Tone; Småstuen, Milada Cvancarova; Kongsgaard, Ulf; Stubhaug, Audun",PLoS One,292,12

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study (Assessing Predictors of Infant RSV Effects and Severity, AsPIRES) was to identify factors associated with severe disease in full-term healthy infants younger than 10 months with primary RSV infection. METHODS: RSV infected infants were enrolled from 3 cohorts during consecutive winters from August 2012 to April 2016 in Rochester, New York. A birth cohort was prospectively enrolled and followed through their first winter for development of RSV infection. An outpatient supplemental cohort was enrolled in the emergency department or pediatric offices, and a hospital cohort was enrolled on admission with RSV infection. RSV was diagnosed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Demographic and clinical data were recorded and samples collected for assays: buccal swab (cytomegalovirus polymerase chain reaction, PCR), nasal swab (RSV qualitative PCR, complete viral gene sequence, 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid [RNA] amplicon microbiota analysis), nasal wash (chemokine and cytokine assays), nasal brush (nasal respiratory epithelial cell gene expression using RNA sequencing [RNAseq]), and 2 to 3 ml of heparinized blood (flow cytometry, RNAseq analysis of purified cluster of differentiation [CD]4+, CD8+, B cells and natural killer cells, and RSV-specific antibody). Cord blood (RSV-specific antibody) was also collected for the birth cohort. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression will be used for analysis of data using a continuous Global Respiratory Severity Score (GRSS) as the outcome variable. Novel statistical methods will be developed for integration of the large complex datasets. RESULTS: A total of 453 infants were enrolled into the 3 cohorts; 226 in the birth cohort, 60 in the supplemental cohort, and 78 in the hospital cohort. A total of 126 birth cohort infants remained in the study and were evaluated for 150 respiratory illnesses. Of the 60 RSV positive infants in the supplemental cohort, 42 completed the study, whereas all 78 of the RSV positive hospital cohort infants completed the study. A GRSS was calculated for each RSV-infected infant and is being used to analyze each of the complex datasets by correlation with disease severity in univariate and multivariate methods. CONCLUSIONS: The AsPIRES study will provide insights into the complex pathogenesis of RSV infection in healthy full-term infants with primary RSV infection. The analysis will allow assessment of multiple factors potentially influencing the severity of RSV infection including the level of RSV specific antibodies, the innate immune response of nasal epithelial cells, the adaptive response by various lymphocyte subsets, the resident airway microbiota, and viral factors. Results of this study will inform disease interventions such as vaccines and antiviral therapies.","Walsh, Edward E; Mariani, Thomas J; Chu, ChinYi; Grier, Alex; Gill, Steven R; Qiu, Xing; Wang, Lu; Holden-Wiltse, Jeanne; Corbett, Anthony; Thakar, Juilee; Benoodt, Lauren; McCall, Matthew N; Topham, David J; Falsey, Ann R; Caserta, Mary T",JMIR Res Protoc,292,28
4424,4424,4424,Development of a tool to assess oral health-related quality of life in patients hospitalised in critical care,20.582409,6.2936144,2019-10-26,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Oral health deteriorates following hospitalisation in critical care units (CCU) but there are no validated measures to assess effects on oral health-related quality of life (OHQoL). The objectives of this study were (i) to develop a tool (CCU-OHQoL) to assess OHQoL amongst patients admitted to CCU, (ii) to collect data to analyse the validity, reliability and acceptability of the CCU-OHQoL tool and (iii) to investigate patient-reported outcome measures of OHQoL in patients hospitalised in a CCU. METHODS: The project included three phases: (1) the development of an initial questionnaire informed by a literature review and expert panel, (2) testing of the tool in CCU (n = 18) followed by semi-structured interviews to assess acceptability, face and content validity and (3) final tool modification and testing of CCU-OHQoL questionnaire to assess validity and reliability. RESULTS: The CCU-OHQoL showed good face and content validity and was quick to administer. Cronbach’s alpha was 0.72 suggesting good internal consistency. For construct validity, the CCU-OHQoL was strongly and significantly correlated (correlation coefficients 0.71, 0.62 and 0.77, p < 0.01) with global OHQoL items. In the validation study, 37.8% of the participants reported a deterioration in self-reported oral health after CCU admission. Finally, 26.9% and 31% of the participants reported considerable negative impacts of oral health in their life overall and quality of life, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The new CCU-OHQoL tool may be of use in the assessment of oral health-related quality of life in CCU patients. Deterioration of OHQoL seems to be common in CCU patients.

The molecular mechanisms underlying these disparate outcomes are currently unknown. Glycosylation within the human host plays a critical role in influenza virus biology. However, the impact these modifications have on the severity of influenza disease has not been examined. Herein, we profile the glycomic host responses to influenza virus infection as a function of disease severity using a ferret model and our lectin microarray technology. We identify the glycan epitope high mannose as a marker of influenza virus-induced pathogenesis and severity of disease outcome. Induction of high mannose is dependent upon the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway, a pathway previously shown to associate with lung damage and severity of influenza virus infection. Also, the mannan-binding lectin (MBL2), an innate immune lectin that negatively impacts influenza outcomes, recognizes influenza virus-infected cells in a high mannose-dependent manner. Together, our data argue that the high mannose motif is an infection-associated molecular pattern on host cells that may guide immune responses leading to the concomitant damage associated with severity.","Heindel, Daniel W.; Koppolu, Sujeethraj; Zhang, Yue; Kasper, Brian; Meche, Lawrence; Vaiana, Christopher A.; Bissel, Stephanie J.; Carter, Chalise E.; Kelvin, Alyson A.; Elaish, Mohamed; Lopez-Orozco, Joaquin; Zhang, Bin; Zhou, Bin; Chou, Tsui-Wen; Lashua, Lauren; Hobman, Tom C.; Ross, Ted M.; Ghedin, Elodie; Mahal, Lara K.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,292,1

A case-control study with service and research implications for immunopsychiatry” (Hao et al., 2020)",20.832275,6.2715173,2020-12-25,"Using 3KO (triple NOX [NADPH oxidase] knockout) mice (ie, NOX1(−/−)/NOX2(−/−)/NOX4(−/−)), we aimed to clarify the role of this family of enzymes in the regulation of platelets in vitro and hemostasis in vivo. APPROACH AND RESULTS: 3KO mice displayed significantly reduced platelet superoxide radical generation, which was associated with impaired platelet aggregation, adhesion, and thrombus formation in response to the key agonists collagen and thrombin. A comparison with single-gene knockouts suggested that the phenotype of 3KO platelets is the combination of the effects of the genetic deletion of NOX1 and NOX2, while NOX4 does not show any significant function in platelet regulation. 3KO platelets displayed significantly higher levels of cGMP—a negative platelet regulator that activates PKG (protein kinase G). The inhibition of PKG substantially but only partially rescued the defective phenotype of 3KO platelets, which are responsive to both collagen and thrombin in the presence of the PKG inhibitors KT5823 or Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPs, but not in the presence of the NOS (NO synthase) inhibitor L-NG-monomethyl arginine. In vivo, triple NOX deficiency protected against ferric chloride–driven carotid artery thrombosis and experimental pulmonary embolism, while hemostasis tested in a tail-tip transection assay was not affected. Procoagulatory activity of platelets (ie, phosphatidylserine surface exposure) and the coagulation cascade in platelet-free plasma were normal. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that inhibiting NOXs has strong antithrombotic effects partially caused by increased intracellular cGMP but spares hemostasis. NOXs are, therefore, pharmacotherapeutic targets to develop new antithrombotic drugs without bleeding side effects.","Vara, Dina; Mailer, Reiner K.; Tarafdar, Anuradha; Wolska, Nina; Heestermans, Marco; Konrath, Sandra; Spaeth, Manuela; Renné, Thomas; Schröder, Katrin; Pula, Giordano",Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol,292,24

Lifestyle interventions aimed at postpartum weight loss to reduce T2DM risk have been reported, but poor compliance remains a barrier. Smartphone-based interventions may improve compliance, but data on its use in women with recent GDM are limited. OBJECTIVE: This trial aimed to investigate the efficacy of a smartphone app in restoring optimal weight following delivery in women with GDM, in the setting of a population with high rates of GDM and type 2 diabetes. METHODS: In this unblinded randomized controlled trial, 200 women with GDM were randomized to receive the intervention or standard care following delivery. The intervention enabled logging of weight, meals, and activity, with web-based interaction with a team comprising dieticians, a physiotherapist, and an occupational therapist. The primary outcome was an achievement of optimal weight (defined as the restoration of first trimester weight if first trimester BMI≤23 kg/m(2) or weight loss of at least 5% from first trimester weight if first trimester BMI>23 kg/m(2)) at 4 months post partum. Secondary outcome measures included absolute weight loss, serum metabolic markers, self-reported nutritional intake, health education, and quality of life via questionnaires and user engagement in the intervention group. RESULTS: In total, 40% (38/96) of women in the intervention group achieved optimal weight at 4 months post delivery compared with 32% (28/93) in the control group (P=.27). Compared with the control group, women in the intervention group reported significantly reduced caloric intake at 4 months after delivery (P<.001) and higher health-directed behavior scores (P=.045). The intervention group also reported increased emotional distress scores (P=.01). At 4 months, participant engagement with the intervention was maintained at 60.8% (SD 33.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Although a statistically significant increase in women achieving healthy weight was not observed, this app remains promising, as women in the intervention group reported improved health behaviors and lower caloric intake. Importantly, the high retention rates suggest that a larger study with a longer follow-up period might confirm the effectiveness of this app for weight management.

OBJECTIVE: To assess statin utilization in LT4-treated patients through an observational drug utilization study. METHODS: Three sites were involved: (1) 10 723 outpatients placed on LT4 during 2006-2019 identified from the Clinical Research Data Warehouse of the University of Chicago; (2) ~1.4 million LT4 prescriptions prepared by primary care physicians during January-December 2018, identified from the IQVIA™ database of medical prescriptions in Brazil; (30 ~5.4 million patient interviews during 2009-2019, including ~0.32 million patients on LT4, identified from the Fleury Group database in Brazil. RESULTS: On site 1, initiation of therapy with LT4 increased the frequency of statin utilization (19.1% vs 24.6%), which occurred ~1.5 years later (median 76 weeks) and, among those patients that were on statins, increased intensity of treatment by 33%, despite normalization of serum TSH levels; on site 2, after matching for sex and age, the frequency of statins prescription was higher for those patients using LT4: females, 2.1 vs 3.4% (odds ratio [OR] 1.656 [1.639-1.673]); males, 3.1 vs 4.4% (OR 1.435 [1.409-1.462]); and, on site 3, after matching for sex and age, the frequency of statin utilization was higher in those patients using LT4: females, 10 vs 18% (OR 2.02 [2.00-2.04]); males, 15 vs 25% (OR 1.92 [1.88-1.96]); all P values were <.0001.

In a Cochrane study from 2017, the authors identified an urgent need for more randomized controlled trials investigating the efficiency and effects of opioid tapering. The study aimed to assess (1) the efficiency of a structured intervention in causing stable reductions of opioid consumption in a population with long-term non-malignant pain and (2) effects on pain, pain cognitions, physical and mental health, quality of life, and functioning in response to opioid tapering. METHODS: The study is a randomized controlled trial. The sample size was set to a total of 140 individuals after estimation of power and dropout. Participants will be recruited from a population with long-term non-malignant pain who will be randomly allocated to (1) the start of tapering immediately or (2) the control group who return to usual care and will commence tapering of opioids 4 months later. A 12-month follow-up is included. When all follow-ups are closed, data from the Swedish drug register of the National Board of Health and Welfare will be collected and individual mean daily opioid dose in morphine equivalents will be calculated at three time points: baseline, 4 months, and 12 months after the start of the intervention. At the same time points, participants fill out the following questionnaires: Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK), Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire (CPAQ-8), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and RAND-36. At baseline and follow-up, a clinical assessment of opioid use disorder is performed. DISCUSSION: A better understanding of the efficiency and effects of opioid tapering could possibly facilitate attempts to taper opioid treatments, which might prove beneficial for both the individual and society.

To derive the causal relationship between institutional trust and compliance behaviour, a probit regression model was used. Findings suggest that trust in public institutions helps to increase compliance with social distancing. In addition, some socio-economic characteristics such as employment status, age or whether individuals felt endangered by COVID-19 had a positive and statistically significant effect on compliance with measures used to slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Institutional trust did not have a statistically significant effect on compliance with face-covering measures.

It is pretty impossible to think of the organisation of life outside his thinking. Here I argue that the idea and practice of mutual aid, articulated by Peter Kropotkin in his 1902 book Mutual Aid (2009) stirs us towards a different understanding of the management of life, bereft of hierarchies and bestowed with co-operation and care. Moreover, as I argue, the existence of mutual aid groups and practices challenges the very idea of the norm. This has become even more apparent during the Covid19 pandemic with the surfacing of mutual aid groups globally. It is therefore rather misleading to understand our present as generator of the ‘new normal’; such claims are mere rhetorical devices aiming at keeping us in our place.","Loizidou, Elena",Law Critique,292,10

Guerra et al. Inflamm Bowel Dis. 2021 Jan 1;27(1):25–33) and 2.) to compare the date of the second and third wave with data of general population from the Autonomous Community of Madrid METHODS: Cohort, observational study in IBD patients followed in our IBD Unit with SARS-CoV-2 infection between March 2020 and May 2020 (first wave) and between July 2020 to March 2021 (second-third wave). All data were collected by telephone interview and reviewing the electronical medical records RESULTS: The demographic characteristics of the patients included are shown in Table 1. Regarding clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 infection in both group of patients are represented in Table 2. The severity of disease was not related to immunomodulators and/or biological treatments in both cohorts. The number of COVID-19 cases by date in our IBD Unit in comparison with the cases in the Community of Madrid are shown in the Figure 1. [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: The patients diagnosed in the first wave were older and more symptomatic. Although the number of severe cases was higher in the first wave, influenced by the limited availability of tests in that period, no difference was found in mortality or in the percentage of ICU admissions.Severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection was not related to immunosuppression and in the second-third wave the IBD treatment was maintained more frequently.The distribution of cases in our series was in concordance with the data obtained in the general population.","Guerra Marina, I; Algaba, A; Castro, S; Jiménez, L; Garza, D; Aller, M D M; Granja, A; Guardiola, A; Gil, M; Ruiz, P; Bermejo, F",J Crohns Colitis,292,1

METHODS: PTX3 expression was analyzed in 119 baseline serum samples from early naïve RA patients, 95 paired samples obtained 6-months following the initiation of cs-DMARDs treatment and 43 healthy donors. RNA-sequencing analysis and immunohistochemistry for PTX3 were performed on a subpopulation of 79 and 58 synovial samples, respectively, to assess PTX3 gene and protein expression. Immunofluorescence staining was performed to characterize PTX3 expressing cells within the synovium. RESULTS: Circulating levels of PTX3 were significantly higher in early RA compared to healthy donors and correlated with disease activity at baseline and with the degree of structural damages at 12-months. Six-months after commencing cs-DMARDs, a high level of PTX3, proportional to the baseline value, was still detectable in the serum of patients, regardless of their response status. RNA-seq analysis confirmed that synovial transcript levels of PTX3 correlated with disease activity and the presence of mediators of inflammation, tissue remodeling and bone destruction at baseline. PTX3 expression in the synovium was strongly linked to the degree of immune cell infiltration, the presence of ectopic lymphoid structures and seropositivity for autoantibodies. Accordingly, PTX3 was found to be expressed by numerous synovial cell types such as plasma cells, fibroblasts, vascular and lymphatic endothelial cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. The percentage of PTX3-positive synovial cells, although significantly reduced at 6-months post-treatment as a result of global decreased cellularity, was similar in cs-DMARDs responders and non-responders. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that, early in the disease and prior to treatment modification, the level of circulating PTX3 is a reliable marker of RA activity and predicts a high degree of structural damages at 12-months. In the joint, PTX3 associates with immune cell infiltration and the presence of ectopic lymphoid structures. High synovial and peripheral blood levels of PTX3 are associated with chronic inflammation characteristic of RA. Additional studies to determine the mechanistic link are required.","Boutet, Marie-Astrid; Nerviani, Alessandra; Lliso-Ribera, Gloria; Leone, Roberto; Sironi, Marina; Hands, Rebecca; Rivellese, Felice; Del Prete, Annalisa; Goldmann, Katriona; Lewis, Myles J.; Mantovani, Alberto; Bottazzi, Barbara; Pitzalis, Costantino",Front Immunol,292,12

These are capable of contributing to the realization of sustainable development goals through averting food and nutritional insecurity, increasing and sustaining yields that translate into increased incomes and later reduced poverty. This is because CSAPs enable farmers to adapt and mitigate climate change effects. However, due to inappropriate communication of CSAPs to the farmers, to date, some farmers still see no escape route from the frightening effects of climate change and they are currently adopting a rather fatalistic attitude. This study investigated the information dissemination pathways used by different categories of smallholder potato farmers for and practice of CSAPs. It found a difference between information sources and practice of CSAPs at a 5% level of significance (χ2 = 100.12139, df = 2, p < 0.05, Cramer's V = 1.0), and a difference in the use of the three information dissemination pathways between men and women at a 5% level of significance (χ2 = 6.05949, df = 2, p < 0.05, Cramer's V = 0.17406). The three information dissemination pathways included media, neighbors and friends, and extension officers. Generally, farmers were aware and practiced the CSAPs investigated in this study except for irrigation with high awareness yet with low uptake percentage and potato seedlings and minitubers both with low awareness and practice respectively. This study recommended mainstreaming of CSAPs information.","Waaswa, Andrew; Nkurumwa, Agnes Oywaya; Kibe, Anthony Mwangi; Kipkemoi, Ng'eno Joel",Heliyon,292,1

We aimed to characterize the clinical, molecular and mismatch repair (MMR) variants spectrum of patients with suspected LS in Latin America. METHODS Eleven LS hereditary cancer registries and 34 published LS databases were used to identify unrelated families that fulfilled the Amsterdam II (AMSII) criteria and/or the Bethesda guidelines or suggestive of a dominant colorectal (CRC) inheritance syndrome. RESULTS We performed a thorough investigation of 15 countries and identified 6 countries where germline genetic testing for LS is available and 3 countries where tumor testing is used in the LS diagnosis. The spectrum of pathogenic MMR variants included MLH1 up to 54%, MSH2 up to 43%, MSH6 up to 10%, PMS2 up to 3% and EPCAM up to 0.8%. The Latin America MMR spectrum is broad with a total of 220 different variants which 80% were private and 20% were recurrent. Frequent regions included exons 11 of MLH1 (15%), exon 3 and 7 of MSH2 (17 and 15%, respectively), exon 4 of MSH6 (65%), exons 11 and 13 of PMS2 (31% and 23%, respectively). Sixteen international founder variants in MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6 were identified and 41 (19%) variants have not previously been reported, thus representing novel genetic variants in the MMR genes. The AMSII criteria was the most used clinical criteria to identify pathogenic MMR carriers although microsatellite instability, immunohistochemistry and family history are still the primary methods in several countries where no genetic testing for LS is available yet. CONCLUSION The Latin America LS pathogenic MMR variants spectrum included new variants, frequently altered genetic regions and potential founder effects, emphasizing the relevance implementing Lynch syndrome genetic testing and counseling in all of Latin America countries.","Rossi, Benedito Mauro; Palmero, Edenir Inêz; López-Kostner, Francisco; Sarroca, Carlos; Vaccaro, Carlos Alberto; Spirandelli, Florencia; Ashton-Prolla, Patricia; Rodriguez, Yenni; de Campos Reis Galvão, Henrique; Reis, Rui Manuel; Escremim de Paula, André; Capochin Romagnolo, Luis Gustavo; Alvarez, Karin; Della Valle, Adriana; Neffa, Florencia; Kalfayan, Pablo German; Spirandelli, Enrique; Chialina, Sergio; Gutiérrez Angulo, Melva; Castro-Mujica, Maria Del Carmen; Sanchez de Monte, Julio; Quispe, Richard; da Silva, Sabrina Daniela; Rossi, Norma Teresa; Barletta-Carrillo, Claudia; Revollo, Susana; Taborga, Ximena; Morillas, L Lena; Tubeuf, Hélène; Monteiro-Santos, Erika Maria; Piñero, Tamara Alejandra; Dominguez-Barrera, Constantino; Wernhoff, Patrik; Martins, Alexandra; Hovig, Eivind; Møller, Pål; Dominguez-Valentin, Mev",BMC cancer,292,27

PATIENTS AND METHODS Retrospective cohort study using medical and pharmacy claims and enrollment information from US commercial and Medicare Advantage with Part D enrollees in the Optum Research Database from March 1, 2014, through April 30, 2019. Claims were linked with mortality data from the Social Security Death Index and the National Death Index. Eligible patients had ≥1 ICI claim between September 1, 2014 and April 30, 2019. RESULTS After adjusting for potential confounding variables, we found patients with AEs had more than double the risk of an inpatient stay (HR, 2.2; 95% CI = 1.9-2.5) and an 80% higher risk of an emergency visit (HR, 1.8; 1.6-2.1) than patients without AEs. Adjusted 6-month total costs were $24,301 higher among patients with an AE versus those without ($99,037 versus $74,736, 95% CI = $18,828-$29,774, p < .001). Mean AE-related medical costs averaged $2359 (SD, $7496) per patient per month, driven by inpatient visits which accounted for 89.9% of AE-related costs. Adjusted risk of mortality was similar in patients with and without AEs. CONCLUSIONS Patients with AEs had higher risks of hospitalizations, ER visits, and higher healthcare costs, driven by inpatient stays, than patients without AEs. The adjusted risk of mortality was similar between the two cohorts. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Patients taking immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) who had adverse events (AEs) had significantly higher healthcare costs and utilization, driven by inpatient stays, compared to patients who did not. Given this high cost associated with AEs and the differences in the side effect profile of ICIs versus traditional chemotherapy, it is important for physicians to be cognizant of these differences when treating patients with ICIs. Ongoing evaluation, earlier recognition and more effective, multidisciplinary management of AEs may improve patient outcomes and reduce the need for costly inpatient stays.","George, Saby; Bell, Elizabeth J; Zheng, Ying; Kim, Ruth; White, John; Devgan, Geeta; Smith, Jodi; Lal, Lincy S; Engel-Nitz, Nicole M; Liu, Frank X",The oncologist,292,13

Studies suggest that an on-site champion may improve the quality of care residents' health outcomes. This review assessed the effectiveness of the champion on staff adherence to guidelines and subsequent resident outcomes in LTC homes. METHOD This was a systematic review and meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials. Eligible studies included residents aged 65 or over and nursing staff in LTC homes where there was a stand-alone or multi-component intervention that used a champion to improve staff adherence to guidelines and resident outcomes. The measured outcomes included staff adherence to guidelines, resident health outcomes, quality of life, adverse events, satisfaction with care, or resource use. Study quality was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool; evidence certainty was assessed using the GRADE approach. RESULTS After screening 4367 citations, we identified 12 articles that included the results of 1 RCT and 11 cluster-RCTs. All included papers evaluated the effects of a champion as part of a multicomponent intervention. We found low certainty evidence that champions as part of multicomponent interventions may improve staff adherence to guidelines. Effect sizes varied in magnitude across studies including unadjusted risk differences (RD) of 4.1% [95% CI: - 3%, 9%] to 44.8% [95% CI: 32%, 61%] for improving pressure ulcer prevention in a bed and a chair, respectively, RD of 44% [95% CI: 17%, 71%] for improving depression identification and RD of 21% [95% CI: 12%, 30%] for improving function-focused care to residents. CONCLUSION Champions may improve staff adherence to evidence-based guidelines in LTC homes. However, methodological issues and poor reporting creates uncertainty around these findings. It is premature to recommend the widespread use of champions to improve uptake of guideline-based care in LTC without further study of the champion role and its impact on cost.

METHODS In this retrospective multicenter study, we evaluated 251 acute stroke patients (pretreatment National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score ≥8) treated with stent-retriever devices. Leukoaraiosis severity was graded as 0-2 (absent-to-moderate) versus 3-4 (severe) according to the van Swieten scale. The main clinical outcome was the proportion of good functional outcome, defined as a modified Rankin Scale of 0-2 at 90 days. RESULTS Significantly fewer patients in the severe LA group than in the absent-to-moderate LA group achieved a good functional outcome (18.4% vs 50.2%, P<0.001).

The timing of definitive management is not standardized in the cerebrovascular community. This study was designed to evaluate the safety of delaying AVM treatment in clinically stable patients with a new hemorrhagic presentation. The authors examined the rate of rehemorrhage or neurological decline in a cohort of patients with ruptured brain AVMs during a period of time posthemorrhage. METHODS Patients presenting to the authors' institution from January 2000 to December 2015 with ruptured brain AVMs treated at least 4 weeks posthemorrhage were included in this analysis. Exclusion criteria were ruptured AVMs that required emergency surgery involving resection of the AVM, prior treatment of AVM at another institution, or treatment of lesions within 4 weeks for other reasons (subacute surgery). The primary outcome measure was time from initial hemorrhage to treatment failure (defined as rehemorrhage or neurological decline as a direct result of the AVM). Patient-days were calculated from the day of initial rupture until the day AVM treatment was initiated or treatment failed. RESULTS Of 102 ruptured AVMs in 102 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 7 (6.9%) failed the treatment paradigm. Six patients (5.8%) had a new hemorrhage within a median of 248 days (interquartile range 33-1364 days). The total ""at risk"" period was 18,740 patient-days, yielding a rehemorrhage rate of 11.5% per patient-year, or 0.96% per patient-month. Twelve (11.8%) of 102 patients were found to have an associated aneurysm. In this group there was a single (8.3%) new hemorrhage during a total at-risk period of 263 patient-days until the aneurysm was secured, yielding a rehemorrhage risk of 11.4% per patient-month. CONCLUSIONS It is the authors' practice to rehabilitate patients after brain AVM rupture with a plan for elective treatment of the AVM. The present data are useful in that the findings quantify the risk of the authors' treatment strategy. These findings indicate that delaying intervention for at least 4 weeks after the initial hemorrhage subjects the patient to a low (< 1%) risk of rehemorrhage. The authors modified the treatment paradigm when a high-risk feature, such as an associated intracranial aneurysm, was identified.","Beecher, Jeffrey S; Lyon, Kristopher; Ban, Vin Shen; Vance, Awais; McDougall, Cameron M; Whitworth, Louis A; White, Jonathan A; Samson, Duke; Batjer, H Hunt; Welch, Babu G",Journal of neurosurgery,292,16

Although the concept was ingenious, technical difficulty was encountered during passage resulting in complications such as hypopharyngeal perforation and esophageal mucosal injury. As a result, most surgeons subsequently changed their route of anvil placement to the transabdominal approach. Advances in stapler technology now allow the head of the anvil to be pre-tilted, permitting transoral introduction with greater ease and safety. This paper describes this improved method for transoral placement of the anvil during laparoscopic gastric bypass and reoperative bariatric surgery.","Nguyen, Ninh T; Hinojosa, Marcelo W; Smith, Brian R; Reavis, Kevin M; Wilson, Samuel E",Obesity surgery,292,31

We sought to determine if the chance of successful reperfusion differs among hospitals, and if hospital site is an independent predictor of reperfusion. METHODS Nine hospitals recruited patients in the Diffusion and Perfusion Imaging Evaluation for Understanding Stroke Evolution Study 2 (DEFUSE 2), a prospective cohort study of endovascular stroke treatment conducted between 2008 and 2011. Patients were included for analysis if they had a baseline Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) score of 0 or 1. Successful reperfusion was defined as a TICI reperfusion score of 2b or 3 at completion of the procedure. Collaterals were assessed using the Collateral Flow Grading System and were dichotomized as poor (0-2) or good (3-4). The association between hospital site and successful reperfusion was first assessed in an unadjusted analysis and subsequently in a multivariate analysis that adjusted for predictors of successful reperfusion. RESULTS 36 of 89 patients (40%) achieved successful reperfusion. The rate of reperfusion varied from 0% to 77% among hospitals in the univariate analysis (χ(2) p<0.001) but hospital site did not remain as an independent predictor of reperfusion in multivariate analysis (p=0.81) after adjustment for the presence of good collaterals (p<0.01) and use of the Merci retriever (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS Reperfusion rates vary among hospitals, which may be related to differences in treatment protocols and patient characteristics. Additional studies are needed to identify all of the factors that underlie this variability as this could lead to strategies that reduce interhospital variability in reperfusion rates and improve clinical outcomes.","Liggins, John T P; Mlynash, Michael; Jovin, Tudor G; Straka, Matus; Kemp, Stephanie; Bammer, Roland; Marks, Michael P; Albers, Gregory W; Lansberg, Maarten G",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,292,19

Our objective was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing MIMVS with conventional sternotomy (CS) in elderly patients (≥65 years old). METHODS We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, clinicaltrials.gov, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for trials and observational studies comparing MIMVS with CS in patients ≥65 years old presenting for mitral valve surgery. We performed a random-effects meta-analysis of all outcomes. RESULTS The MIMVS group had lower odds of acute renal failure (odds ratio [OR] 0.27; 95% CI 0.10 to 0.78), prolonged intubation (>48 h; OR 0.47; 95% CI 0.31 to 0.70), less blood product transfusion (weighted mean difference [WMD] -0.82 units; 95% CI -1.29 to -0.34 units), shorter ICU length of stay (LOS; WMD -2.57 days; 95% CI -3.24 to -1.90 days) and hospital LOS (WMD -4.06 days; 95% CI -5.19 to -2.94 days). There were no significant differences in the odds of mortality, stroke, respiratory infection, reoperation for bleeding, and postoperative atrial fibrillation. MIMVS was associated with longer cross-clamp (WMD 11.8 min; 95% CI 3.5 to 20.1 min) and cardiopulmonary bypass times (WMD 23.0 min; 95% CI 10.4 to 35.6 min). CONCLUSIONS MIMVS in elderly patients is associated with lower postoperative complications, blood transfusion, shorter ICU, and hospital LOS, and longer cross-clamp and bypass times.","Hage, Ali; Hage, Fadi; Al-Amodi, Hussein; Gupta, Suruchi; Papatheodorou, Stefania I; Hawkins, Robert; Ailawadi, Gorav; Mittleman, Murray A; Chu, Michael W A",Innovations,292,31

Diffuse alveolar injury and pulmonary fibrosis both are pathological features of ARDS. This study investigated the effect of Rehmannia Radix extract (RRE) on pulmonary fibrosis of infants with ARDS. MATERIAL AND METHODS The human lung fibroblasts cell line HFL1 was treated with various concentrations of Rehmannia Radix extract in different groups for different times. Flow cytometry and TUNEL assay were performed to detect cell apoptosis, and CCK8 assay was utilized to analyze cell proliferation. TGF-ß1 expression was detected by real-time quantitative PCR, and protein-level expressions of Caspase3, TGF-ß1, Bcl-2, and Smad3 were measured by western blot and immunohistochemical staining in cells or tissues. TGF-ß1 was overexpressed by recombinant human TGF-ß1 (2 ng/mL) and the treated cells and culture supernatant were harvested for analysis in each step. Bleomycin was used to induce a mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis and was confirmed by HE pathological sections. RESULTS Flow cytometry and TUNEL results showed that RRE promoted the apoptosis of HFL1 cells in a concentration-dependent manner, and it inhibited the proliferation of HFL1 cells. Upregulation of TGF-ß1 reversed the effects of RRE in HFL1 cells. RRE alleviated pulmonary fibrosis in mice through downregulating Bcl-2, TGF-ß1, and Smad3 expression. CONCLUSIONS RRE promoted apoptosis and inhibited proliferation of HFL1, and then arrested the progression of pulmonary fibrosis. RRE had a significant inhibitory effect on TGF-ß1 and Smad3. These results suggest that RRE directly prevents the development of pulmonary fibrosis by affecting the expression of TGF-ß1 and Smad3.","Hu, Xiaoming; Zhu, Dongzhe",Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,292,1

The virus is suspected to have originated in swine through reassortment and to have subsequently crossed the species-barrier towards humans. Several cases of reintroduction into pigs have since been reported, which could possibly create a reservoir for human exposure or ultimately become endemic in the pig population with similar clinical disease problems as current swine influenza strains. A soluble trimer of hemagglutinin (HA), derived from the H1N1v, was used as a vaccine in pigs to investigate the extent to which this vaccine would be able to protect pigs against infection with the H1N1v influenza strain, especially with respect to reducing virus replication and excretion. In a group of unvaccinated control pigs, no clinical symptoms were observed, but (histo)pathological changes consistent with an influenza infection were found on days 1 and 3 after inoculation. Live virus was isolated from the upper and lower respiratory tract, with titres up to 10(6) TCID(50) per gram of tissue. Furthermore, live virus was detected in brain samples. Control pigs were shedding live virus for up to 6 days after infection, with titres of up to 10(5) TCID(50) per nasal or oropharyngeal swab. The soluble H1N1v HA trimer diminished virus replication and excretion after a double vaccination and subsequent challenge. Live virus could not be detected in any of the samples taken from the vaccinated pigs. Vaccines based on soluble HA trimers provide an attractive alternative to the current inactivated vaccines.","Loeffen, W L A; de Vries, R P; Stockhofe, N; van Zoelen-Bos, D; Maas, R; Koch, G; Moormann, R J; Rottier, P J M; de Haan, C A M",Vaccine,292,30

Their improvement would reduce inequalities among various Communities/Districts or groups of Communities. A Community health index (CHI) in this regard is estimated to explore inequality ratio, inequality slope, and spatial analysis of inequalities among all Communities at regional and geographical levels. METHODS Data from Pakistan Social and Living Standard Measurement (PSLM) survey, Round-VI, 2014-15 were used to construct CHI. The index was constructed in two steps. In the first step, the study indicators were standardized while in the second step, the standardized indicators were aggregated into a single metric by applying non-linear Geometric Mean formula. RESULTS The inequality ratio of 16.59 estimated for Pakistan was found to be higher than the ratio of Atlanta city, GA (5.92), whereas, a lower slope coefficient was estimated for Pakistan than Atlanta city, GA (0.38 < 0.54). This ratio of disparity was also found to be lower for urban regions as compared to rural (7.78 < 17.54). While the slope coefficient was slightly higher for urban regions (0.45 > 0.43). The results of the spatial analysis revealed different patterns of inequalities. A cluster of healthy districts was found in Punjab province, whereas districts from Baluchistan had made a bunch of deprived/unhealthy districts in terms of CHI scores. Besides, separate maps for all provinces showed that capital districts of all provinces were relatively well-off/developed. CONCLUSION The instant results concluded that inequalities in access to health and health-related indicators exist across countries as well as across geographical regions. To reduce or eradicate these inequalities, government and public health workers are recommended to set priorities based on access to composite index.","Khan, Sami Ullah; Hussain, Ijaz",BMC public health,292,12

METHODS From January 2010 to May 2015, 131 consecutive patients with ruptured intracranial aneurysms were treated by endovascular methods at our institution. Among the 21 patients (16%) treated by intra-arterial thrombolysis for the thrombus formation during the procedure, nine patients (nine aneurysms) suffered from thrombus remnant. We reviewed the clinical and radiologic outcomes of patients with thrombus remnant as well as intraoperative and postoperative management of thrombus formation. RESULTS Thrombus formation occurred near the coiled aneurysm in eight patients, and distal embolic occlusion was observed in one patient. All nine patients were initially managed by intra-arterial thrombolysis with tirofiban. One patient with persistent distal embolic occlusion and two patients with distal migration of the thrombus after intra-arterial thrombolysis were additionally treated with stent retriever. One patient with occlusion of the parent artery near the coiled aneurysm despite intra-arterial thrombolysis was partially recanalized by permanent deployment of a stent retriever. Delayed cerebral angiography showed no increase in size of thrombus remnant in any patients. After the procedure, thrombus remnant was managed by intravenous tirofiban. Follow-up CT angiography on the first postoperative day showed patent arterial flow, and ischemic complication related with thromboembolism did not occur in any patients. One patient suffered from hemorrhagic complication. CONCLUSION If the patency of parent artery is maintained and the size of the thrombus remnant does not increase on delayed angiography after intra-arterial thrombolysis, postoperative thromboembolic events rarely occur.","Jun, Hyo Sub; Ahn, Jun Hyong; Kim, Ji Hee; Oh, Jae Keun; Song, Joon Ho; Chang, In Bok","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",292,19

The developed localization system is based on wireless Local Area Network (LAN) infrastructure (commonly referred to as Wi-Fi), evaluating signal strength from different access points, using the fingerprinting method for localization. The most serious problems consist in multipath signal propagation and the different sensitivities (calibration) of Wi-Fi adapters installed in different mobile devices. To solve these issues, an algorithm based on fuzzy logic is proposed to optimize the localization performance. The localization system consists of five elements, which are mobile applications for Android OS, a fuzzy derivation model, and a web surveillance environment for displaying the localization results. All of these elements use a database and shared storage on a virtualized server running Ubuntu. The developed system is implemented in Java for Android-based mobile devices and successfully tested.

However, in industry, these more complex drug delivery systems such as liposomes require more material and time to develop. Here, we report a liposome and lipodisk decision tree with model compounds of diverse physicochemical properties to understand how to resourcefully optimize encapsulation efficiency (EE) for these lipid-based drug delivery systems. We have identified trends with physicochemical properties such as Log P, where higher Log P compounds such as curcumin were able to efficiently load into the lipid bilayer resulting in high EE with altering the drug/lipid (D/L) ratio. Moderate Log P compounds such as cyclosporine A and dexamethasone had significantly higher encapsulation in lipodisks, which contain higher amounts of PEG lipid compared to liposomes. The EE of negative Log P compounds, like acyclovir, remained low regardless of altering the D/L ratio and PEG concentrations. In this study, microfluidic techniques were employed to fabricate liposomes and lipodisks formulations allowing for a reproducible strategy for formulation development. Both liposome and lipodisk of curcumin demonstrated enhanced in vivo performance compared with a conventional formulation in the rat pharmacokinetic study. This combination of approaches with multiple model compounds and lipid-based drug delivery systems provides a systematic guidance to effective strategies to generate higher EE with minimal drug waste and expedite the process for preclinical development when applied to industry compounds.","Levy, Elizabeth S; Yu, Jesse; Estevez, Alberto; Mao, Jialin; Liu, Liling; Torres, Elizabeth; Leung, Dennis; Yen, Chun-Wan",The AAPS journal,292,1

In this study, the short- and long-term outcomes and recurrence patterns of one-stage LLR for bilobar CRLM were compared to single laparoscopic resection for CRLM. METHODS This single-center study consisted of all patients who underwent a parenchymal sparing LLR for CRLM between October 2011 and December 2018. Demographics, perioperative outcomes, short-term outcomes, oncologic outcomes and recurrence patterns were compared. Data were retrieved from a prospectively maintained database. RESULTS Thirty six patients underwent a LLR for bilobar CRLM and ninety patients underwent a single LLR. Demographics were similar among groups. More patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the bilobar group (55.6% vs 34.4%, P = 0.03). There was no difference in conversion rate, R0 resection and transfusion rate. Blood loss and operative time were higher in the bilobar group (250 ml (IQR 150-450) vs 100 ml (IQR 50-250), P < 0.001 and 200 min (IQR 170-230) vs 130 min (IQR 100-165), P < 0.001) and hospital stay was longer (5 days (IQR 4-7) vs 4 days (IQR 3-6), P = 0.015). The bilobar group had more technically major resections (88.9% vs 56.7%, P < 0.001). Mortality was nil in both groups and major morbidity was similar (2.8% vs 3.3%, P = 1.0). There was no difference in recurrence pattern. Overall survival (OS) was similar (1 yr: 96% in both groups and 5 yr 76% vs 66%, P = 0.49), as was recurrence-free survival (RFS) (1 yr: 64% vs 73%, 3 yr: 38 vs 42%, 5 yr: 38% vs 28%, P = 0.62).

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is another widely spread virus that chronically affects about 257 million people. The management of patients with HBV infection has gained attention in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients with COVID-19 have varying levels of liver involvements, resulting from direct viral effects on the liver as well as hepatotoxic drugs. This was demonstrated by elevated levels of liver enzymes, particularly evident in those patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, scarce information is available on the management of COVID-19 patients having an underlying chronic liver disease, including HBV infection. Studies have shown reactivation of HBV infection following treatment with tocilizumab and corticosteroids, emphasizing the need for caution when using these agents to treat COVID-19 patients with HBV infection. HBV screening and prophylaxis should be considered in patients with elevated transaminases levels and also in high prevalence populations. In patients with advanced liver disease, attention must be given to minimize the risk of liver decompensation.

OBJECTIVE To prospectively analyze the impact of HRQoL between obese patients who underwent surgery and those who were wait-listed. METHODS Between April 2017 and March 2018, 70 surgical and 69 wait-listed patients were interviewed twice, at baseline and at the 12-month follow-up. Quality of life was measured by the SF-12v2 and the Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Lite (IWQoL-Lite) questionnaires. Sociodemographic-, clinical-, and surgical-related variables were collected. RESULTS One hundred thirty-nine patients were analyzed, showing similar baseline characteristics but differences in HRQoL. Performing more qualified work improved scores on some aspects of the SF-12 survey. In contrast, women scored worse on the self-esteem domain, and men scored worse on the mental health domain. By group, at the 12-month follow-up, statistically significant differences were found among all aspects of the questionnaires between both groups (P < 0.001) and between baseline and postoperative 12-month follow-up in the surgical group (P < 0.001). Furthermore, scores were lower in all domains in the evolution of wait-listed patients, with statistically significant differences among the Bodily Pain, Emotional Role, Mental Health, and Mental Component Summary Domains (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION HRQoL is a multimodal concept that allows the identification of factors impacting obese patients' quality of life. It promotes the benefit of surgery against waiting list delays, which can take up to 4 years in our hospital. Therefore, HRQoL is an important pillar to justify more resources for reducing unacceptable surgical delays.","Moreno Gijón, María; Díaz Vico, Tamara; Rodicio Miravalles, José Luis; López-Negrete Cueto, Emilio; Suárez Sánchez, Aida; Amoza Pais, Sonia; Sanz Navarro, Sandra; Valdés Arias, Covadonga; Turienzo Santos, Estrella O; Sanz Álvarez, Lourdes M",Obesity surgery,292,17

Twenty-three weeks after dialysis was commenced, the patient underwent a renal transplant. Thirteen weeks post-transplant, the patient felt an unusual sensation after defecation. The curled end of the catheter was seen protruding from the anus. He was admitted, and investigations showed stable graft function, with abdominal X ray showing no free air.Intraoperative findings showed a small perforation of the sigmoid colon sealed off by adherence of several small intestinal loops. This was repaired laparoscopically after removal of the distal part of the catheter per rectum. No peritoneal contamination was seen. He was treated with 5 days of intravenous antibiotics and gradual introduction of enteral feeds. His graft function remained stable throughout.Timing of catheter removal varies, from the time of transplantation to over 3 months post-transplantation. Bowel perforation due to PD catheter insertion is rare and tends to occur at the time of insertion. Anal protrusion of a PD catheter in childhood is extremely rare and unrecorded in a pediatric patient with a connective tissue disorder.

By focusing on key concepts that users work with when setting up infusions and the extent to which the system supports them, our analysis highlights how actions are influenced by the different resources available to users including: the device itself; supporting artefacts; the conceptual understanding of the user; and the community of practice the user is part of. The findings reveal the ways in which users are resourceful in their day-to-day activities and also suggest potential vulnerabilities within the wider system that could threaten patient safety. Our approach is able to make previously under-explored aspects of practice visible, thus enabling insight into how users act and why.","Iacovides, Ioanna; Blandford, Ann; Cox, Anna; Back, Jonathan","Cognition, technology & work",292,31

Fewer pretreatment steps correspond to lower chances of infection. The authors established a direct injection technique to analyze levetiracetam (LEV) concentrations in human serum and studied its application in therapeutic drug monitoring. METHODS Serum samples were prepared by hollow fiber centrifugal ultrafiltration and the filtrate was directly injected into a UHPLC apparatus (Waters UPLC BEH C18 column: 50 mm × 2.1 mm, 1.7 μm) for analysis. The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile and water (8:92) at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The column temperature was maintained at 30°C. The detected wavelength was 210 nm. RESULTS A linear relationship was obtained for LEV from 0.625 to 80 μg/mL (r = 0.999). The limit of detection (LOD) for the analysis of LEV was 0.125 μg/mL. The analysis time was shortened to 4 min. The recovery rate of LEV based on the current method was 96.6-100.1%, whereas the absolute recovery rate was 93.2-96.8%. The relative standard deviation (RSD) of intraday and interday precision was <7.3%. Stability was achieved at room temperature for 24 hr after 3 freeze-thaw cycles and at -80 °C for 21 days. The method was successfully applied to determine LEV concentrations in the serum of 19 patients. CONCLUSION The present method is simple, accurate, and sensitive and can improve biosafety with the direct injection technique. It is suitable for the analysis of LEV concentrations in therapeutic drug monitoring.","Dong, Wei-Chong; Guo, Jia-Liang; Yang, Xiu-Ling; Wang, Shu-Mei; Yuan, Ye; Zhao, Meng-Qiang; Jiang, Ye; Zhang, Zhi-Qing",Therapeutic drug monitoring,292,17

Under anesthetization, an electrical burns instrument (100˚C) was used to scald the backs of rabbits for 15 sec, which established a 30% III severe burns model. Treatment of the rabbits with early anticoagulation effectively improved the severe burns complicated by inhalation injury‑induced lung injury, reduced PaO2, PaCO2 and SPO2 levels, suppressed the expression of tumor necrosis factor‑α, interleukin (IL)‑1β and IL‑6, and increased the activity of IL‑10. In addition, it was found that early anticoagulation treatment effectively suppressed the activities of caspase‑3 and caspase‑9, upregulated the protein expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and decreased the protein expression of protease‑activated receptor 1 (PAR1) in the severe burns model. It was concluded that early anticoagulation treatment affected the severe burns complicated by inhalation injury in a rabbit model through the upregulation of VEGF and downregulation of PAR1 signaling pathways. Thus, early anticoagulation is a potential therapeutic option for severe burns complicated by inhalation injury.","Fu, Zhong-Hua; Guo, Guang-Hua; Xiong, Zhen-Fang; Liao, Xincheng; Liu, Ming-Zhuo; Luo, Jinhua",Molecular medicine reports,292,16

The aim of this study was to compare the short-term clinical outcomes of the minimally invasive Ivor-Lewis oesophagectomy (MIILE) technique with those of the open Ivor-Lewis oesophagectomy (OILE) technique. METHODS We identified 131 patients who underwent MIILE combined with thoracoscopy and laparoscopy. These patients were compared with 248 patients who underwent OILE between January 2012 and December 2013. RESULTS MIILE and OILE produced similar post-operative hospital mortality (MIILE 2.3 versus OILE 2%; P = 1.000). The MIILE approach was associated with a significant decrease in the time until chest drain removal (MIILE 9.07 ± 5.075 days versus OILE 11.26 ± 6.989 days; P = 0.002) and post-operative length of stay (MIILE 10.89 ± 4.976 days versus OILE 12.83 ± 6.921 days; P = 0.002). Pneumonia was the most common complication in both groups. MIILE patients exhibited a lower incidence of post-operative pneumonia (MIILE 17.6% versus OILE 28.2%; P = 0.024) compared with OILE. The survival rate did not significantly differ between the MIILE and OILE groups (1-year survival rates: MIILE 86 versus OILE 88.2%; P = 0.537). CONCLUSIONS In this study, we demonstrate that MIILE is a feasible and safe approach for patients with middle or lower oesophageal cancer.","Mei, Xinyu; Xu, Meiqing; Guo, Mingfa; Xie, Mingran; Liu, Changqing; Wang, Zhou",ANZ journal of surgery,292,1

Four human coronaviruses (hCoVs)-229E, HKU1, NL63 and OC43-circulate globally, commonly infect children and typically cause mild upper respiratory tract infections. Three novel coronaviruses of zoonotic origin have emerged during the past two decades: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and the recently discovered severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which is the cause of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. These novel coronaviruses are known to cause severe illness and death predominantly in older adults and those with underlying comorbidities. Consistent with what has been observed during the outbreaks of SARS and MERS, children with COVID-19 are more likely to be asymptomatic or to have mild-to-moderate illness, with few deaths reported in children globally thus far. Clinical symptoms and laboratory and radiological abnormalities in children have been similar to those reported in adults but are generally less severe. A rare multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) which has resulted in critical illness and some deaths has recently been described. Clinical trials for therapeutics and vaccine development should include paediatric considerations. Children may play an important role in the transmission of infection and outbreak dynamics and could be a key target population for effective measures to control outbreaks. The unintended consequences of the unprecedented scale and duration of pandemic control measures for children and families around the world should be carefully examined.

There is scanty information on its current status and vaccination compliance among captive wild birds (CWB) and indigenous chickens (LC) in Nigeria. This study aimed to assess the exposure and the risk factors associated with IBV in CWB and LC from North-central and South west regions of Nigeria. Sera samples from 218 LC and 43 CWB were examined for IBV IgG using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Also, owners of LC and managers of CWB were interviewed using a pre-tested structured checklist. An overall IBV prevalence of 42.9% (112/261) was obtained. Captive wild birds and indigenous chickens had 11.6% (5/43) and 49.1% (107/218) prevalence respectively with a significant difference (p< 0.0001, OR= 7.3, 95% CI= 2.8-19.3). Also, geo-location indicated significant difference in IBV exposure among birds (p<=0.034). Furthermore, the study showed that there had never been laboratory screening on all acquired wild birds for exposure to infectious agents in the study location while none of these birds (LB/CWB) had history of vaccination. Since IBV is endemic in Nigeria, the use of vaccine for prophylactic measure should be advocated among LC and CWB owners in order to avoid unnecessary losses. Also, the essence of screening for infectious agents in newly acquired wild birds should be considered crucial for health sustenance and public safety.","Daodu, O B; Jokotola, P T; Omowon, A A; Olorunshola, I D; Ahmed, O A; Raufu, I A; Raji, M A; Daodu, O C",Tropical biomedicine,292,7

Understanding how all-cause mortality has changed with respect to development status can identify exemplars for best practice. To accomplish this, the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016) estimated age-specific and sex-specific all-cause mortality between 1970 and 2016 for 195 countries and territories and at the subnational level for the five countries with a population greater than 200 million in 2016. METHODS We have evaluated how well civil registration systems captured deaths using a set of demographic methods called death distribution methods for adults and from consideration of survey and census data for children younger than 5 years. We generated an overall assessment of completeness of registration of deaths by dividing registered deaths in each location-year by our estimate of all-age deaths generated from our overall estimation process. For 163 locations, including subnational units in countries with a population greater than 200 million with complete vital registration (VR) systems, our estimates were largely driven by the observed data, with corrections for small fluctuations in numbers and estimation for recent years where there were lags in data reporting (lags were variable by location, generally between 1 year and 6 years). For other locations, we took advantage of different data sources available to measure under-5 mortality rates (U5MR) using complete birth histories, summary birth histories, and incomplete VR with adjustments; we measured adult mortality rate (the probability of death in individuals aged 15-60 years) using adjusted incomplete VR, sibling histories, and household death recall. We used the U5MR and adult mortality rate, together with crude death rate due to HIV in the GBD model life table system, to estimate age-specific and sex-specific death rates for each location-year. Using various international databases, we identified fatal discontinuities, which we defined as increases in the death rate of more than one death per million, resulting from conflict and terrorism, natural disasters, major transport or technological accidents, and a subset of epidemic infectious diseases; these were added to estimates in the relevant years. In 47 countries with an identified peak adult prevalence for HIV/AIDS of more than 0·5% and where VR systems were less than 65% complete, we informed our estimates of age-sex-specific mortality using the Estimation and Projection Package (EPP)-Spectrum model fitted to national HIV/AIDS prevalence surveys and antenatal clinic serosurveillance systems. We estimated stillbirths, early neonatal, late neonatal, and childhood mortality using both survey and VR data in spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression models. We estimated abridged life tables for all location-years using age-specific death rates. We grouped locations into development quintiles based on the Socio-demographic Index (SDI) and analysed mortality trends by quintile. Using spline regression, we estimated the expected mortality rate for each age-sex group as a function of SDI. We identified countries with higher life expectancy than expected by comparing observed life expectancy to anticipated life expectancy on the basis of development status alone. FINDINGS Completeness in the registration of deaths increased from 28% in 1970 to a peak of 45% in 2013; completeness was lower after 2013 because of lags in reporting. Total deaths in children younger than 5 years decreased from 1970 to 2016, and slower decreases occurred at ages 5-24 years. By contrast, numbers of adult deaths increased in each 5-year age bracket above the age of 25 years. The distribution of annualised rates of change in age-specific mortality rate differed over the period 2000 to 2016 compared with earlier decades: increasing annualised rates of change were less frequent, although rising annualised rates of change still occurred in some locations, particularly for adolescent and younger adult age groups. Rates of stillbirths and under-5 mortality both decreased globally from 1970. Evidence for global convergence of death rates was mixed; although the absolute difference between age-standardised death rates narrowed between countries at the lowest and highest levels of SDI, the ratio of these death rates-a measure of relative inequality-increased slightly. There was a strong shift between 1970 and 2016 toward higher life expectancy, most noticeably at higher levels of SDI. Among countries with populations greater than 1 million in 2016, life expectancy at birth was highest for women in Japan, at 86·9 years (95% UI 86·7-87·2), and for men in Singapore, at 81·3 years (78·8-83·7) in 2016. Male life expectancy was generally lower than female life expectancy between 1970 and 2016, and the gap between male and female life expectancy increased with progression to higher levels of SDI. Some countries with exceptional health performance in 1990 in terms of the difference in observed to expected life expectancy at birth had slower progress on the same measure in 2016. INTERPRETATION Globally, mortality rates have decreased across all age groups over the past five decades, with the largest improvements occurring among children younger than 5 years. However, at the national level, considerable heterogeneity remains in terms of both level and rate of changes in age-specific mortality; increases in mortality for certain age groups occurred in some locations. We found evidence that the absolute gap between countries in age-specific death rates has declined, although the relative gap for some age-sex groups increased. Countries that now lead in terms of having higher observed life expectancy than that expected on the basis of development alone, or locations that have either increased this advantage or rapidly decreased the deficit from expected levels, could provide insight into the means to accelerate progress in nations where progress has stalled.

Our objective was to investigate the tracheal pattern of injury resulting from cuff inflation of the tracheal tube, to study the two main factors responsible for PTR (cuff overinsufflation and inapplicable tube sizes), and to explain the context, why small women are particularly susceptible to PTR. METHODS Experimental study performed on 28 fresh human laryngotracheal specimens (16 males, 12 females) within 24 hours post autopsy. Artificial ventilation was simulated by using an underwater construction and a standard tracheal tube. Tube sizes were selected according to our previously published nomogram. Tracheal lesions were detected visually and tracheal diameters measured. The influence of body size, sex difference and appropriate tube size were investigated according to patient height. RESULTS In all 28 cases, the typical tracheal lesion pattern was a longitudinal median rupture of the posterior trachea. Appropriate tube sizes according to body size caused PTR with significantly higher cuff pressure when compared with oversized tubes. An increased risk of PTR was found in shorter patients, when oversized tubes were used. Sex difference did not have any significant influence. CONCLUSION This experimental model provides information about tracheal patterns in PTR for the first time. The model confirms by experiment the observations of case series in PTR patients, and therefore emphasizes the importance of correct tube size selection according to patient height. This minimizes the risk of PTR, especially in shorter patients, who have an increased risk of PTR when oversized tubes are used.","Sudhoff, Tobias H; Seidl, Rainer O; Estel, Barbara; Coordes, Annekatrin",Clinical and experimental otorhinolaryngology,292,19

However, low rates of compliance amongst healthcare workers have been reported globally. The COVID-19 pandemic has further emphasized the need for global improvement in healthcare worker hand hygiene compliance. AIM This comprehensive systematic review provides an up-to-date compilation of clinical trials, reported between 2014 and 2020, assessing hand hygiene interventions in order to inform healthcare leaders and practitioners regarding approaches for reduction of healthcare-associated infections using hand hygiene. METHODS We searched CINAHL, Cochrane, EMbase, Medline, Pubmed, and Web of Science databases for clinical trials published between March 2014 and December 2020 on the topic of hand hygiene compliance among healthcare professionals. From these searches, a total of 332 papers were identified of which 57 studies met criteria. FINDINGS Forty-five of the 57 studies (79%) included were conducted in Asia, Europe and the USA. A large majority of these clinical trials were conducted in acute care facilities, including hospital wards and intensive care facilities. Nurses were the largest group of healthcare workers studied followed by physicians, represented in 44 (77%) and 41 (72%) studies, respectively. Thirty-six studies (63%) adopted the World Health Organisation multimodal framework or a variation of it, and many of these recorded hand hygiene opportunities at each of the five moments, although recording of hand hygiene technique was not common.

Its function is to detect foreign bodies and promote their elimination through opsonisation or lysis. Complement proteins play an important role in the immunopathogenesis of several disorders. However, excessive complement activation does not confer more protection but instead leads to several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. With inappropriate activation of the complement system, activated complement proteins and glycoproteins may damage both healthy and diseased tissues. Development of complement inhibitors represents an effective approach in controlling dysregulated complement activity and reducing disease severity, yet few studies have investigated the nature and role of novel complement inhibitory proteins of viral origin.

Methods: The clinical data of 178 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 admitted to Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital were retrospectively analyzed from January 21 to February 9, 2020. According to the patient's antiviral treatment regimen, 178 patients were divided into 4 groups including LPV/r group (59 patients), arbidol group (36 patients), combination therapy with LPV/r plus arbidol group (25 patients) and the conventional treatment group without any antiviral drugs (58 patients). The main observation end points of the study was the negative conversion time of nucleic acid of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in pharyngeal swab. Results: The baseline of 4 groups before treatment was consistent and comparable. The negative conversion time of nucleic acid of the 2019-nCoV in pharyngeal swab was (10.20 ± 3.49), (10.11 ± 4.68), (10.86 ± 4.74), (8.44 ± 3.51) days separately in the LPV/r group, the arbidol group, the combination therapy group, and the conventional treatment group without significant difference (F = 2.556, P = 0.058). There was also no significant difference in the rate of negative conversion rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid, the improvement ration in clinical symptoms, and the improvement ration of pulmonary infection in the lung CT imaging (P> 0.05). However, a statistically significant difference was found in the proportion of deterioration changing from mild/moderate to severe/critical type at day 7 (χ(2) = 9.311, P = 0.017) as follows: the combination therapy group (24.0%, 6/25), the arbidol group ( 16.7%, 6/36), LPV/r group (5.4%, 3/56) and conventional treatment group (5.2%, 3/58). Moreover, the frequency of adverse reactions in the three groups receiving antiviral drugs was significantly higher than that in the conventional treatment group (χ(2) = 14.875, P = 0.002). Conclusions: No evidences could prove that LPV/r and arbidol could shorten the negative conversion time of novel coronavirus nucleic acid in pharyngeal swab nor improve the symptoms of patients. Furthermore, the combination usage of LPV/r and arbidol may not benefit for improving the disease. Noteworthy, the adverse reactions of the antiviral drugs should be paid careful attention during the treatment.","Wen, C Y; Xie, Z W; Li, Y P; Deng, X L; Chen, X T; Cao, Y; Ou, X; Lin, W Y; Li, F; Cai, W P; Li, L H",Zhonghua nei ke za zhi,292,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS Nine patients (7 females and 2 males; mean age 27.6 years, range 23-34), with 10 renal AMLs with a mean size of 6.3 cm (range 4.5-8.5) were treated with image-guided percutaneous MWA. Indications for treatment were the risk of rupture/hemorrhage due to size greater than 4 cm and symptomatology; in one case, a previous hemorrhage was the indication for treatment. During follow-up, the volume of the ablated AMLs and its relationship with the relief of symptoms were registered. Technical and clinical success, safety, and quality of life (QOL) were evaluated in a mean follow-up of 9 months (range 3-12). RESULTS Technical success was obtained in all cases. Clinical success was obtained in all cases; the volume of the ablated AMLs was not related with symptoms relief; all patients referred a significant improvement in their QOL, with a regularization of daily activities. There were no major procedural complications or delayed adverse events. A small self-limited post-procedural subcapsular hematoma was registered. Post-ablation syndrome was registered in 5 cases and was self-limited in all cases. CONCLUSIONS Symptoms relief, lower risk of hemorrhage and a normalized QOL were obtained in all patients with a safe and mini-invasive procedure.","Ierardi, Anna Maria; Petrillo, Mario; Coppola, Andrea; Angileri, Salvatore Alessio; Galassi, Andrea; Padovano, Barbara; Volpi, Angela; Cozzolino, Mario; Carrafiello, Gianpaolo",La Radiologia medica,292,1

This paper presents the structure and content of the two camps, our reflections on moving from a face-to-face to an online situation and our elaboration how the UDL principles apply to eLearning to create Universal Design for eLearning (UDeL). We found that because we already had a syllabus for the camp prepared, transferring it to an online camp did not present a great number of challenges. Some aspects of the online situation were actually advantageous (e.g. presenting all materials digitally and making them fully accessible) while others were difficult to overcome (e.g. engaging all participants in online activities and discussions). We provide a set of recommendations of how to implement the three principles of UDL in eLearning situations.","Eftring, Håkan; Olaussen, Elinor Jeanette; Petrie, Helen; Saarela, Merja; Ladonlahti, Tarja; Torkildsby, Anne Britt",Studies in health technology and informatics,292,19

At 71 d after the initial visit, the cat died with anemia, jaundice, and hypoalbuminemia, and was subjected to autopsy. Grossly, numerous firm masses, 0.5-2.5 cm diameter, were randomly located in the left lobe of the pancreas. Histologic examination revealed that the pancreatic mass consisted of 2 tumor cell types: mostly small round cells with a minority of epithelial cells. The small cells were arranged in nests of various sizes, which were separated by thin fibrous stroma, and had small, round, hyperchromatic nuclei, scant cytoplasm containing argyrophilic granules, and often formed rosettes. The epithelial cells formed luminal structures. Metastases were observed in the liver, greater omentum, and pancreatic, gastric, pulmonary, and mediastinal lymph nodes. Immunohistochemical examination revealed that the small cells were positive for vimentin, neuron-specific enolase, chromogranin A, cytokeratin (CK) AE1/AE3, and trypsin, whereas the epithelial cells were positive for AE1/AE3, trypsin, CK19, and nestin. Ultrastructurally, the small cells contained abundant electron-dense granules, ~200 nm diameter, whereas the epithelial cells had apical microvilli and numerous zymogen granules, ~300 nm diameter.

Electromagnetic navigation can also be a useful adjunct to computed tomography (CT)-guided thermal ablation and biopsy of lung tumors. This study compares procedures carried out using an EM navigation system (Veran Medical Technologies Inc, St Louis, MO) with procedures using CT fluoroscopy only. METHODS Over a 23-month period, 17 patients scheduled for thermal ablation were prospectively enrolled in this study. The mean age was 72 years (range, 60-84 years). Seven patients were women. Patients were randomized to EM navigation (n = 7) or CT fluoroscopy alone (n = 10). In some cases, additional ablation or biopsies were performed with or without EM navigation depending on the randomization arm. All procedures were performed under general anesthesia either by a thoracic surgeon or a radiologist. RESULTS A total of 23 procedures were performed in 17 patients: 20 were ablation procedures and 3 were biopsies. Fourteen were performed for non-small cell lung cancer, and 9 for pulmonary metastases from other organs. Despite randomization, patients receiving EM navigation had a trend for smaller tumors (mean diameter, 1.45 vs 2.90 cm; P = 0.06). For thermal ablation procedures, the time to complete intervention was significantly less when EM navigation was used (mean, 7.6 vs 19 minutes; P = 0.022). Although not statistically significant, there were fewer skin punctures (mean, 1 vs 1.25; P = 0.082), fewer adjustments (mean, 5.6 vs 11.8; P = 0.203), less CT fluoroscopy time (mean, 21.3 vs 34.3 seconds; P = 0.345), and fewer CT scans (mean, 7 vs 15; P = 0.204) whenever EM navigation was used. CONCLUSIONS Electromagnetic navigation reduces the time to successfully place an ablation probe in a target tumor. Further study is required to determine whether EM navigation may also reduce the number of adjustments, skin punctures, and CT scans as well as decrease CT fluoroscopy time.","Narsule, Chaitan K; Sales Dos Santos, Ricardo; Gupta, Avneesh; Ebright, Michael I; Rivas, Roberto; Daly, Benedict D T; Fernando, Hiran C",Innovations,292,12

A Cross-Sectional Study.,20.629337,6.7232184,2021-02-02,"The importance of social support for parental and child health and wellbeing is not yet sufficiently widely recognized. The widespread myth in Western contexts that the male breadwinner-female homemaker nuclear family is the 'traditional' family structure leads to a focus on mothers alone as the individuals with responsibility for child wellbeing. Inaccurate perceptions about the family have the potential to distort academic research and public perceptions, and hamper attempts to improve parental and child health. These perceptions may have arisen partly from academic research in disciplines that focus on the Western middle classes, where this particular family form was idealized in the mid-twentieth century, when many of these disciplines were developing their foundational research. By contrast, evidence from disciplines that take a cross-cultural or historical perspective shows that in most human societies, multiple individuals beyond the mother are typically involved in raising children: in evolutionary anthropology, it is now widely accepted that we have evolved a strategy of cooperative reproduction. Expecting mothers to care for children with little support, while expecting fathers to provide for their families with little support, is, therefore, likely to lead to adverse health consequences for mothers, fathers and children. Incorporating evidence-based evolutionary, and anthropological, perspectives into research on health is vital if we are to ensure the wellbeing of individuals across a wide range of contexts.

The studies were prompted by the observation that infection of human fetal brain cells with Zika virus (ZIKV) induces expression of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2), a host factor that was found to promote ZIKV replication and spread. A drug that targets NOD2 was shown to have potent broad-spectrum antiviral activity against other flaviviruses, alphaviruses, enteroviruses, and SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. Another drug that inhibits the receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 2 (RIPK2) which functions downstream of NOD2, also decreased replication of these pathogenic RNA viruses. The antiviral effect of this drug was particularly potent against enteroviruses. The broad-spectrum action of nodosome targeting drugs is mediated in part by enhancement of the interferon response. Together, these results suggest that further preclinical investigation of nodosome inhibitors as potential broad-spectrum antivirals is warranted.","Limonta, Daniel; Dyna-Dagman, Lovely; Branton, William; Mancinelli, Valeria; Makio, Tadashi; Wozniak, Richard W; Power, Christopher; Hobman, Tom C",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,292,1

Therefore, respiratory tract volumes were measured in lambs and tidal volumes were compared in preterm infants before and after intubation. DESIGN In seven preterm lambs, volumes of the airways (oropharynx, trachea, lungs) were assessed. In 10 preterm infants, delta pressures, tidal volumes and leak were measured during ventilation 2 min before (mask ventilation) and 2 min after intubation (endotracheal ventilation). Inflations coinciding with breaths were excluded. OUTCOME MEASURES Amount of upper airway distention in lambs and differences in inspiratory and expiratory tidal volume before and after intubation. RESULTS In lambs, the combined trachea and oropharynx contributed to 14 (12-21) % (median (IQR), whereas the oropharynx contributed to 9 (7-10) % of the total tidal volume measured at the mouth. In preterm infants, inspiratory (11.1 (7.9-22.6) mL/kg vs 5.8 (3.9-9.6) mL/kg (p=0.01)) and expiratory (8.3 (6.8-15.4) mL/kg vs 4.9 (3.9-9.6) mL/kg (p=0.02)) tidal volumes were significantly larger during mask ventilation compared with endotracheal ventilation. Leak was 18.7 (3.3-28.7) % before versus 0 (0-2.3) % after intubation (p<0.0001). Delta pressure was 23.7 (20.8-25.6) cm H2O before versus 24.8 (20.8-26.0) cm H2O after intubation (p>0.05). During mask ventilation, expiratory tidal volume increased from 10.0 (5.4-15.6) mL/kg to 11.3 (7.6-17.0) mL/kg (p=0.01), but remained unchanged during endotracheal ventilation. CONCLUSIONS During neonatal mask ventilation, distention of the upper respiratory tract contributes to the tidal volumes measured and should be taken into account when targeting tidal volumes during mask ventilation.","van Vonderen, Jeroen J; Hooper, Stuart B; Krabbe, Vera B; Siew, Melissa L; Te Pas, Arjan B",Archives of disease in childhood.

The excess mortality is partly due to the influx of patients requiring hospitalization and intensive care. We propose that the chronology of epidemic spread gives a window of time in which hospitals can act to prevent reaching capacity. METHODS The out-of-hospital SAMU Emergency Medical System in an entry point into the French health care system. We recorded the number of patients managed, of patients transferred to emergency departments (ED), and of mobile intensive care units (MICUs) dispatched. Each criterion was compared to the mean of the same criterion over the previous 5 years. The alert threshold which indicated a public health crisis was defined as a 20% increase compared to the 5-year mean. RESULTS The reference period, from January 2015 to December 2019, included 3 381 611 calls, and 1 137 856 patients. The study period, from 17 February to 28 March 2020, included 166 888 calls, and 56 708 patients. The daily numbers of patients managed crossed the threshold on February 25, and increased until the end of the study period. The daily number of patients transferred to ED crossed the threshold on March 16, and increased until the end of the period. The daily number of MICUs dispatched crossed the threshold on March 15, and increased until the end of the period.

However, recent implants and technique advances may allow for improvement in outcomes. Our institution has developed novel graft constructs and techniques for reconstructions with preclinical data supporting clinical use. Our study purpose was to assess clinical outcomes after reconstruction for MKLI using our constructs and techniques. Overall success rate, failure/revision rates, return to work (RTW)/return to sports (RTS) rates, and complications were evaluated testing the hypothesis that novel methods would be associated with clinical benefits with respect to applications and outcomes compared with historical results. We reviewed a single-surgeon, longitudinal database of 42 patients who underwent multiligament reconstruction at our institution using these techniques for at least two-ligament injuries. Visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score and PROMIS (patient-reported outcomes measurement information system) were collected preoperatively and postoperatively at a minimum 1-year follow-up. Among these patients, 33 patients (mean age of 28.9 years, mean body mass index (BMI) of 33.2 kg/m2, mean follow-up of 14.2 months) were included for outcomes analyses. With the definition of success as having a VAS score of less than or equal to 2 without revision/salvage surgery due to recurrent/residual instability or arthritis, overall success rate was 88% (29/33).

The mean preoperative PROMIS mental health score was 36.2 ± 7, general health was 33.5 ± 6, pain was 62.7 ± 8, and physical function score was 29.4 ± 3. At the final follow-up, PROMIS MH was 50.2 ± 10, GH was 44.4 ± 9, pain was 54.3 ± 9, and PF was 42.6 ± 8.4. Return to work rate was 94% (31/33), and 52% (17/33) of patients were able to RTS at any level. Our results demonstrated excellent clinical outcomes associated with a primary success rate of 88% and RTW rate of 94%. Intraoperative complications occurred in 9.5% of cases and revision and failure rates were 9% and 3%, respectively. Our initial results suggest that multiligament reconstructions using novel graft constructs and techniques are safe and effective and can be considered an appropriate option for reconstruction of the full clinical spectrum of MLKIs.","Lee, John Hee-Young; Cook, James L; Wilson, Nichole; Rucinski, Kylee; Stannard, James P",The journal of knee surgery,292,30

With the lack of in-person away rotations for the 2020-2021 residency application cycle, virtual rotations have surfaced as an alternative. The virtual rotations that the authors participated in allowed for active participation in various resident educational activities such as journal club, grand rounds, and morning conferences. One critical aspect of virtual rotations was the one-on-one meetings with the program leadership. In addition to a virtual tour of the hospital and campus, many programs offered virtual social hours with the residents to converse about the program, the city, and the match process. A few programs even allowed applicants to attend virtually live-streamed surgeries. These rotations offer students, especially those without a corresponding home program, an invaluable opportunity to express their interest in a particular program and gain foundational knowledge about the specialty. Virtual rotations also provide underrepresented minorities and international medical graduates with clinical exposure, mentorship, and networking opportunities, mitigating some of the challenges presented by COVID-19.","Asaad, Malke; Glassman, Gabriella E; Allam, Omar",The Journal of surgical research,292,1

Understanding interagency coordination in preparing for and responding to extreme events such as disease outbreaks is central to reducing risks and coordination costs. METHODS We evaluated the pattern of information flow for actors involved in disaster medicine through social network analysis. Social network analysis of agencies can serve as a basis for the effective design and reconstruction of disaster medicine response coordination structures. This research used new theoretical approaches in suggesting a framework and a method to study the outcome of complex inter-organizational networks in coordinating disease outbreak response. We present research surveys of 70 health professionals from different skill sets and organizational positions during the swine influenza A (H1N1) PDM09 2009 pandemic. The survey and interviews were designed to collect both qualitative and quantitative data in order to build a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the dynamics of the inter-organizational networks that evolved during the pandemic. RESULTS The degree centrality of the informal network showed a positive correlation with performance, in which the ego's performance is related to the number of links he or she establishes informally-outside the standard operating structure during the pandemic. Informal networks facilitate the transmission of both strong (ie, infections, confirmed cases, deaths in hospital or clinic settings) and weak (ie, casual acquaintances) ties. CONCLUSIONS The results showed that informal networks promoted community-based ad hoc and formal networks, thus making overall disaster medicine and public health preparedness more effective.

The objective of this study was to assess the impact of an interactive anesthesiology educational program on the wellness of anesthesia providers and their children, as assessed by a modified Professional Fulfillment Index. DESIGN Prospective observational study. SETTING Perioperative area. PATIENTS Thirty clinicians participated in the program. Twenty respondents, representing 67% of participants and each corresponding to a parent and their child or children, completed the post-event survey. INTERVENTIONS An interactive anesthesiology educational program incorporating children, between the ages of five and eighteen years old, of anesthesia providers was held in the perioperative area. The program was held over four hours and was comprised of four sessions including pediatric anesthesia, neuroanesthesia, airway, and ultrasound stations. MEASUREMENTS Anesthesia providers and their children were administered a post-event assessment, including a modified Professional Fulfillment Index and satisfaction survey. MAIN RESULTS All twenty (100%) of respondents indicated it was ""very true"" or ""completely true"" that their child was happy with the program, and that it was worthwhile and satisfying to both the anesthesia provider and their child. Nineteen (95%) of reporting participants indicated it was ""very true"" or ""completely true"" that it was meaningful to have the department host such a program and 17 (85%) respondents felt their child now better understands the anesthesia work of the parent. All clinician volunteers indicated it was ""very true"" or ""completely true"" that they were contributing professionally during the program in ways that they valued most. CONCLUSION An interactive educational wellness initiative provides an effective and feasible method for increasing professional fulfillment and satisfaction among anesthesia providers while educating our youngest generation of learners. Implementation of such a program may also occur with modifications such as televideo to maintain COVID-19 precautions.","Jung, Michael J; Libaw, Justin S; Manuel, Solmaz P; Kathiriya, Irfan S; Srejic, Una; Gandhi, Seema",Journal of clinical anesthesia,292,5

Targeted digital client communication is when the health system transmits information to particular individuals or groups of people, based on their health or demographic status. Common types of targeted client communication are text messages that remind people to go to appointments or take their medicines. Other types include phone calls, interactive voice response, or multimedia messages that offer healthcare information, advice, monitoring, and support. OBJECTIVES To explore clients' perceptions and experiences of targeted digital communication via mobile devices on topics related to reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, or adolescent health (RMNCAH). SEARCH METHODS We searched MEDLINE (OvidSP), MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations (OvidSP), Embase (Ovid), World Health Organization Global Health Library, and POPLINE databases for eligible studies from inception to 3-6 July 2017 dependant on the database (See appendix 2). SELECTION CRITERIA We included studies that used qualitative methods for data collection and analysis; that explored clinets' perceptions and experiences of targeted digital communication via mobile device in the areas of RMNCAH; and were from any setting globally. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We used maximum variation purposive sampling for data synthesis, employing a three-step sampling frame. We conducted a framework thematic analysis using the Supporting the Use of Research Evidence (SURE) framework as our starting point. We assessed our confidence in the findings using the GRADE-CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) approach. We used a matrix approach to explore whether potential implementation barriers identified in our synthesis had been addressed in the trials included in the related Cochrane Reviews of effectiveness. MAIN RESULTS We included 35 studies, from a wide range of countries on six continents. Nineteen studies were conducted in low- and middle-income settings and sixteen in high-income settings. Some of the studies explored the views of people who had experienced the interventions, whereas others were hypothetical in nature, asking what people felt they would like from a digital health intervention. The studies covered a range of digital targeted client communication, for example medication or appointment reminders, prenatal health information, support for smoking cessation while pregnant, or general sexual health information.Our synthesis showed that clients' experiences of these types of programmes were mixed. Some felt that these programmes provided them with feelings of support and connectedness, as they felt that someone was taking the time to send them messages (moderate confidence in the evidence). They also described sharing the messages with their friends and family (moderate confidence).However, clients also pointed to problems when using these programmes. Some clients had poor access to cell networks and to the internet (high confidence). Others had no phone, had lost or broken their phone, could not afford airtime, or had changed their phone number (moderate confidence). Some clients, particularly women and teenagers, had their access to phones controlled by others (moderate confidence). The cost of messages could also be a problem, and many thought that messages should be free of charge (high confidence). Language issues as well as skills in reading, writing, and using mobile phones could also be a problem (moderate confidence).Clients dealing with stigmatised or personal health conditions such as HIV, family planning, or abortion care were also concerned about privacy and confidentiality (high confidence). Some clients suggested strategies to deal with these issues, such as using neutral language and tailoring the content, timing, and frequency of messages (high confidence).Clients wanted messages at a time and frequency that was convenient for them (moderate confidence). They had preferences for different delivery channels (e.g. short message service (SMS) or interactive voice response) (moderate confidence). They also had preferences about message content, including new knowledge, reminders, solutions, and suggestions about health issues (moderate confidence). Clients' views about who sent the digital health communication could influence their views of the programme (moderate confidence).For an overview of the findings and our confidence in the evidence, please see the 'Summary of qualitative findings' tables.Our matrix shows that many of the trials assessing these types of programmes did not try to address the problems we identified, although this may have been a reporting issue. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Our synthesis identified several factors that can influence the successful implementation of targeted client communication programmes using mobile devices. These include barriers to use that have equity implications. Programme planners should take these factors into account when designing and implementing programmes. Future trial authors also need to actively address these factors and to report their efforts in their trial publications.","Ames, Heather Mr; Glenton, Claire; Lewin, Simon; Tamrat, Tigest; Akama, Eliud; Leon, Natalie",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,292,1

In this study, we describe a strong impairment of rotavirus replication upon inhibition of proteasomal activity. The effect was evidenced at the level of accumulation of viral proteins, viral RNA, and yield of infective particles. Kinetic studies revealed that the early steps of the replicative cycle following attachment, entry, and uncoating were clearly more sensitive to proteasome inhibition. We ruled out a direct inhibition of the viral polymerase activities and stability of viral proteins and found that the crucial step that was impaired by blocking proteasome activity was the assembly of new viroplasms. This was demonstrated by using chemical inhibitors of proteasome and by gene silencing using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) specific for different proteasomal subunits and for the ubiquitin precursor RPS27A. In addition, we show that the effect of proteasome inhibition on virus infection is not due to increased levels of beta interferon (IFN-β).","Contin, R; Arnoldi, F; Mano, M; Burrone, O R",Journal of virology,292,1

Our aim was to identify the potential for incomplete occlusion of intracranial aneurysms treated by flow diverters. We investigated whether aneurysm ostium size in relation to parent artery size affects angiographic outcomes of flow diverter-treated sidewall aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS Flow diverter-treated sidewall aneurysms were divided into ""occluded"" and ""residual"" (incomplete occlusion) groups based on 6-month angiographic follow-up. We calculated the ostium ratio, a new parameter defined as the aneurysm ostium surface area versus the circumferential surface area of the parent artery. We also calculated the neck ratio, defined as clinical aneurysm neck diameter versus parent artery diameter from pretreatment 2D DSA, as a 2D surrogate. We compared the performance of these ratios with existing aneurysm morphometrics (size, neck diameter, volume, aspect ratio, size ratio, undulation index, nonsphericity index, ellipticity index, bottleneck factor, aneurysm angle, and parent vessel angle) and flow diverter-related parameters (metal coverage rate and pore density). Statistical tests and receiver operating characteristic analyses were performed to identify significantly different parameters between the 2 groups and test their predictive performances. RESULTS We included 63 flow diverter-treated aneurysms, 46 occluded and 17 residual. The ostium ratio and neck ratio were significantly higher in the residual group than in the occluded group (P < .001 and P = .02, respectively), whereas all other parameters showed no statistical difference. As discriminating parameters for occlusion, ostium ratio and neck ratio achieved areas under the curve of 0.912 (95% CI, 0.838-0.985) and 0.707 (95% CI, 0.558-0.856), respectively. CONCLUSIONS High ostium ratios and neck ratios could predict incomplete occlusion of flow diverter-treated sidewall aneurysms. Neck ratio can be easily calculated by interventionists to predict flow-diverter treatment outcomes.","Paliwal, N; Tutino, V M; Shallwani, H; Beecher, J S; Damiano, R J; Shakir, H J; Atwal, G S; Fennell, V S; Natarajan, S K; Levy, E I; Siddiqui, A H; Davies, J M; Meng, H",AJNR.

We also investigated whether bandwidth was influenced by implant location with respect to the superior sagittal sinus and branching cortical veins; it was not. Finally, we assessed whether electrode orientation had an impact on recording quality. There was no significant difference in bandwidths from electrodes facing different orientations. Interestingly, electrodes facing the skull (180°) were still able to record neural information with high fidelity. Consequently, a minimally invasive surgical approach combined with a stent-electrode array is a safe and efficacious technique to acquire neural signals over a chronic duration.","Opie, Nicholas L; John, Sam E; Rind, Gil S; Ronayne, Stephen M; May, Clive N; Grayden, David B; Oxley, Thomas J",Conference proceedings : ...

RESULTS 90.2% (n = 65) of residents and 85.7% (n = 24) of faculty surgeons reported having received nutritional education. The majority (78%) of respondents utilize patient nutrition on a regular basis (monthly or more often), with 54% reporting utilization daily or weekly. Overall, 65% of respondents reported experiencing challenges in managing patient nutritional needs, and 86% agreed that additional nutritional education during training would assist with patient care.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the safety and efficacy of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) versus vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in patients with AF undergoing cardioversion. METHODS We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies comparing DOACs to VKAs in patients undergoing cardioversion for AF. We performed title, abstract, and full-text screening, data extraction, and risk of bias evaluation independently and in duplicate. We pooled data using a random effects model and evaluated the overall quality of evidence using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation. RESULTS We identified three eligible RCTs (n = 5203) and 21 observational studies (n = 11,855). The three RCTs and four observational studies were at low risk of bias. In RCTs (mean follow-up, 30 days), thromboembolic events occurred in 0.18% of patients receiving DOACs, as compared with 0.55% receiving VKAs (relative risk [RR] 0.40, 95% CI [0.13, 1.24], moderate quality). Major bleeding occurred in 0.42% of patients receiving DOACs as compared with 0.64% receiving VKAs (RR 0.62, 95% CI [0.28, 1.35], moderate quality), and death occurred in 0.28% of patients receiving DOACs as compared with 0.38% receiving VKAs (RR 0.70, 95% CI [0.23, 2.10], low quality). Confidence in the estimates of effect for observational studies was very low.

The secondary outcome was to evaluate foreign body feeling and the quality of life after inguinal hernia repair. METHODS The patients were randomized into two study groups as follows: the OLP group received Optilene LP mesh and the PPG group received self-gripping Parietex ProGrip mesh. Pain scores were measured on a visual analog scale. Foreign body feeling was registered as a yes or no question. Quality of life was evaluated using the Medical Outcome Study Short-Form 36 questionnaire. RESULTS A total of 75 patients in the OLP group and 70 patients in the PPG group were included in the analysis. According to the primary end point, 45.3% and 31.4% of the patients in the OLP group and PPG group experienced pain during different activities at 6-mo follow-up, respectively (P = 0.092). Per secondary end point, 22.7% in the OLP group and 40% in the PPG group reported foreign body feeling at the operation site at 6-mo follow-up (P = 0.031, risk ratio 0.57, 95% confidence interval 0.29-1.07). There were no significant differences in any domain of quality of life according to the Short-Form 36 questionnaire between the two study groups at 6-mo follow-up, except for the social functioning domain (P = 0.035). In the OLP group, the quality of life scores improved significantly after operation in all domains except for general health and mental health. In the PPG group, the quality of life scores improved significantly after operation in the domains of bodily pain, physical functioning, and physical role. CONCLUSIONS Self-gripping mesh compared with standard Lichtenstein operation has no advantages in reducing chronic pain 6-mo after surgery. The rate of foreign body feeling was higher in the self-gripping mesh group. Scores of bodily pain, physical functioning, and physical role improved significantly in both study groups after hernia surgery.","Nikkolo, Ceith; Vaasna, Tiit; Murruste, Marko; Seepter, Helmut; Suumann, Jaanus; Tein, Andres; Kirsimägi, Ülle; Lepner, Urmas",The Journal of surgical research,292,7

Critically ill patients often suffer from systemic inflammatory conditions and concurrently experience short-lived hypoxia. We evaluated the effects of short-term hypoxia on systemic inflammation, and show that it potently attenuates pro-inflammatory cytokine responses during murine endotoxemia. These effects are independent of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), but involve augmented adenosine levels, in turn resulting in an adenosine 2B receptor-mediated post-transcriptional increase of interleukin (IL)-10 production. We translated our findings to humans using the experimental endotoxemia model, where short-term hypoxia resulted in enhanced plasma concentrations of adenosine, augmentation of endotoxin-induced circulating IL-10 levels, and concurrent attenuation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine response. Again, HIFs were shown not to be involved. Taken together, we demonstrate that short-term hypoxia dampens the systemic pro-inflammatory cytokine response through enhanced purinergic signaling in mice and men. These effects may contribute to outcome and provide leads for immunomodulatory treatment strategies for critically ill patients.","Kiers, Dorien; Wielockx, Ben; Peters, Esther; van Eijk, Lucas T; Gerretsen, Jelle; John, Aaron; Janssen, Emmy; Groeneveld, Rianne; Peters, Mara; Damen, Lars; Meneses, Ana M; Krüger, Anja; Langereis, Jeroen D; Zomer, Aldert L; Blackburn, Michael R; Joosten, Leo A; Netea, Mihai G; Riksen, Niels P; van der Hoeven, Johannes G; Scheffer, Gert-Jan; Eltzschig, Holger K; Pickkers, Peter; Kox, Matthijs",EBioMedicine,292,1

A detailed disease model of COVID-19 is combined with a model of the US economy to estimate the direct impact of labor supply shock to each sector arising from morbidity, mortality, and lockdown, as well as the indirect impact caused by the interdependencies between sectors. During a lockdown, estimates of jobs that are workable from home in each sector are used to modify the shock to labor supply. Results show trade-offs between economic losses, and lives saved and infections averted are non-linear in compliance to social distancing and the duration of the lockdown. Sectors that are worst hit are not the labor-intensive sectors such as the Agriculture sector and the Construction sector, but the ones with high valued jobs such as the Professional Services, even after the teleworkability of jobs is accounted for. Additionally, the findings show that a low compliance to interventions can be overcome by a longer shutdown period and vice versa to arrive at similar epidemiological impact but their net effect on economic loss depends on the interplay between the marginal gains from averting infections and deaths, versus the marginal loss from having healthy workers stay at home during the shutdown.","Chen, Jiangzhuo; Vullikanti, Anil; Santos, Joost; Venkatramanan, Srinivasan; Hoops, Stefan; Mortveit, Henning; Lewis, Bryan; You, Wen; Eubank, Stephen; Marathe, Madhav; Barrett, Chris; Marathe, Achla",Scientific reports,292,16

RESULTS More than half (55%) of survey respondents delayed seeking healthcare during lockdown. Factors at a national or health system-level that could influence delay were changing public service messages, an excessive focus on COVID-19 and urgent issues, and poor service integration. Influential factors at a primary care-level were communication and outreach, use of technology, gatekeeping, staff manner and the safety of the clinical practice environment. Factors that influenced patients' individual decisions to seek healthcare were the ability to self-manage and self-triage, consciousness of perceived pressure on health services and fear of infection. CONCLUSION In future pandemic lockdowns or crises, appropriate access to primary care services can be improved by unambiguous national messages and better integration of services. Primary care practices should adopt rapid proactive outreach to patients, fostering a calm but safe clinical practice environment. More support for patients to self-manage and self-triage appropriately could benefit over-burdened health systems during lockdowns and as part of business as usual in less extraordinary times.","Imlach, Fiona; McKinlay, Eileen; Kennedy, Jonathan; Pledger, Megan; Middleton, Lesley; Cumming, Jacqueline; McBride-Henry, Karen",International journal of health policy and management,292,1

SUBJECTS AND METHODS A single center, retrospective cohort study was conducted with transgender men who underwent surgical correction of their urethral stricture(s) between January 2013 and March 2020. The medical charts of 72 transgender men with 147 urethral strictures were reviewed. The primary outcomes were the success and recurrence rates after surgical treatment for urethral strictures. RESULTS At last follow-up (median of 61 (IQR 25-202) months), 50/72 (69%) were able to void while standing (after one (60%), two (20%), three (6%), four (8%), five (4%), or seven (2%) procedures), 10/72 (14%) awaited further treatment, 2/72 (3%) sat to void in despite of good urodynamic function, and 10/72 (14%) had a definitive urethrostomy. Of 104 surgical treatments included in separate success rate analysis, 65 (63%) were successful (43/75 (57%) after phalloplasty, 22/29 (76%) after metoidioplasty). Highest success rates in short urethral strictures were seen after Heineke-Mikulicz procedure (6/7, 86%), and in longer or more complicated urethral strictures after two-stage with graft (4/6, 67%), two-stage without graft (10/12, 83%), pedicled flap (11/15, 73%), and single-stage graft (7/7, 100%) urethroplasties. Grafts used were buccal mucosa or full-thickness skin grafts. Success rates improved over time, with success rates of 38% and 36% in 2013 and 2014, to 71% and 73% in 2018 and 2019, respectively. We concluded with a surgical treatment algorithm based on previous literature, stricture characteristics, and our surgical outcomes. CONCLUSION Highest success rates were observed after Heineke-Mikulicz procedure in short urethral strictures, and after graft, pedicled flap, or two-stage urethroplasties in longer or more complicated urethral strictures. Finally, the majority of transgender men were able to void while standing, though in some multiple surgical procedures were necessary to accomplish this.","de Rooij, Freek P W; Peters, Femke R M; Ronkes, Brechje L; van der Sluis, Wouter B; Al-Tamimi, Muhammed; van Moorselaar, R Jeroen A; Bouman, Mark-Bram; Pigot, Garry L S",BJU international,292,16

When infected with MHV, mice deficient in IFN-associated receptor expression (IFNAR(-/-)) became moribund by 48 h postinfection. MHV also replicated to higher titers and exhibited a more broad tissue tropism in these mice, which lack a type I IFN response. Interestingly, MHV induced IFN-beta in the brains and livers, two main targets of MHV replication, of infected wild-type mice. MHV infection of primary cell cultures indicates that hepatocytes are not responsible for the IFN-beta production in the liver during MHV infection. Furthermore, macrophages and microglia, but not neurons or astrocytes, are responsible for IFN-beta production in the brain. To determine the pathway by which MHV is recognized in macrophages, IFN-beta mRNA expression was quantified following MHV infection of a panel of primary bone marrow-derived macrophages generated from mice lacking different pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Interestingly, MDA5, a PRR thought to recognize primarily picornaviruses, was required for recognition of MHV. Thus, MHV induces type I IFN in macrophages and microglia in the brains of infected animals and is recognized by an MDA5-dependent pathway in macrophages. These findings suggest that secretion of IFN-beta by macrophages and microglia plays a role in protecting the host from MHV infection of the central nervous system.","Roth-Cross, Jessica K; Bender, Susan J; Weiss, Susan R",Journal of virology,292,20

Most healthcare-based disease surveillance systems, however, have significant inherent reporting delays due to data collection, aggregation, and distribution processes. Recent work has shown that machine learning methods leveraging a combination of traditionally collected epidemiological information and novel Internet-based data sources, such as disease-related Internet search activity, can produce meaningful ""nowcasts"" of disease incidence ahead of healthcare-based estimates, with most successful case studies focusing on endemic and seasonal diseases such as influenza and dengue. Here, we apply similar computational methods to emerging outbreaks in geographic regions where no historical presence of the disease of interest has been observed. By combining limited available historical epidemiological data available with disease-related Internet search activity, we retrospectively estimate disease activity in five recent outbreaks weeks ahead of traditional surveillance methods. We find that the proposed computational methods frequently provide useful real-time incidence estimates that can help fill temporal data gaps resulting from surveillance reporting delays. However, the proposed methods are limited by issues of sample bias and skew in search query volumes, perhaps as a result of media coverage.","Aiken, Emily L; McGough, Sarah F; Majumder, Maimuna S; Wachtel, Gal; Nguyen, Andre T; Viboud, Cecile; Santillana, Mauricio",PLoS computational biology,292,16

We disagree with the authors' interpretation of our data and their own (2), for six reasons: 1) Only predicted LOF (pLOF) variants are relevant for comparison between the two studies, because, unlike us, these authors did not test variants experimentally. The relevant proportion in our data is therefore not 24/659=3.5%, but 9/659= 1.36%, whereas theirs is 1/713=0.14%. 2) Our definitions of 'severe/critical' patients are different: we defined critical disease as severity grades 6-10 of the WHO scale (3), whereas they restricted their recruitment to grades 7-10 (i.e., excluding patients on high-flow oxygen, considered in our study). Their cohort of 'mild' cases may therefore include 'severe' COVID-19 cases (grade 6), such as perhaps their 'mild' TLR3 pLOF carrier. 3) Their 'controls' are subjects from the general population, without depletion of COVID-19 genetic risk factors, whereas we used pauci-/asymptomatic infected subjects (grades 1-3) as 'controls'. Consequently their power computation in Figure 1 is based on an incorrect hypothesis about the odds ratio, which would be expected to be lower when using general population controls (as they did), than when using pauci- and asymptomatic infected individuals (as we did). 4) The ethnic origin of the patients differs between the two studies: 58% of our 659 patients (and 8 of our 9 pLOF carriers) were European, versus only 10% of their 713 patients with severe disease (and their pLOF carrier is East Asian). 5) Age is a key factor neglected in their comparison: our sample was much younger (mean age: 51.8 years) than theirs (mean: 65.9 years), and seven of our nine pLOF carriers were < 60 years old. We performed a comparison stratified by age (<60/≥60 years), and no significant difference in pLOF proportion was found between the two studies, even ignoring the only patient carrying a pLOF they found (of unknown age): 7/458 in our sample vs. 0/192 in their sample (p=0.11, Fisher's exact test) for patients <60 years old, and 2/201 vs. 0/521 (p=0.07) for patients ≥60 years old. 6) Finally, and crucially, the authors did not exclude patients with autoantibodies against type I IFN, which account for at least 10% of critical cases and are much more frequent in patients > 60 years of age, particularly men (4).","Zhang, Qian; Cobat, Aurélie; Bastard, Paul; Notarangelo, Luigi D; Su, Helen C; Abel, Laurent; Casanova, Jean-Laurent",The Journal of clinical investigation,292,1

The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of EUS-BD for primary treatment of malignant biliary obstruction and comparison to traditional ERCP. Methods Individualized search strategies were developed through November 2018 using PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines. A cumulative meta-analysis was performed by calculating pooled proportions. Subgroup analysis was performed for studies comparing EUS-BD versus ERCP. Heterogeneity was assessed with Cochran Q test or I 2 statistics, and publication bias by funnel plot and Egger's tests. Results Seven studies (n = 193 patients; 57.5 % males) evaluating primary EUS-BD for malignant biliary obstruction were included. Mean age was 67.4 years (2.3) followed an average of 5.4 months (1.0). For primary EUS-BD, pooled technical success, clinical success, and adverse event (AE) rates were 95 % (95 % CI 91 - 98), 97 % (95 % CI 93 - 100), and 19 % (95 % CI 11 - 29), respectively. Among EUS-BD and ERCP comparator studies, technical and clinical success, and total AEs were not different with lower rates of post-ERCP pancreatitis and reintervention among the EUS-BD group. Conclusion Primary EUS-BD is an effective treatment with few AE. Comparing EUS-BD versus ERCP, EUS-BD has comparable efficacy and improved safety as a primary treatment for malignant biliary obstruction. Further randomized trials should be performed to identify patient populations and clinical scenarios in which primary EUS-BD would be most appropriate.","Hathorn, Kelly E; Bazarbashi, Ahmad Najdat; Sack, Jordan S; McCarty, Thomas R; Wang, Thomas J; Chan, Walter W; Thompson, Christopher C; Ryou, Marvin",Endoscopy international open,292,1

A new electronic digital chest drainage evaluation system (DCS) recently became clinically available. This study was designed to evaluate the clinical application of the DCS in monitoring the airflow volume and managing postoperative PAL. METHODS We prospectively enrolled 25 patients who underwent pulmonary resection. Postoperative PAL was evaluated using both conventional PAL grading based on the physician's visual judgment (analog chest drainage evaluation system [ACS]: Level 0 = no leakage to 4 = continuous leakage) and the DCS. The DCS digital measurement was recorded as the flow volume (ml/min), which was taken once daily from postoperative day 1 to the day of chest drainage tube removal. RESULTS In total, 45 measurements were performed on 25 patients during the evaluation period. Postoperative PAL was observed in five patients (20.0%) and judged as ACS Level >1. The mean DCS values corresponding to ACS Levels 0, 1, 2, and 3 were 2.42 (0.0-11.3), 48.6 (35.4-67.9), 95.6 (79.7-111.5), and 405.3 (150.3-715.6), respectively. The Spearman correlation test showed a significant positive correlation between the ACS PAL level and DCS flow volume (R = 0.8477, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS A relationship between the visual PAL level by the ACS and the digital value by the DCS was identified in this study. The numeric volume obtained by the DCS has been successful in information-sharing with all staff. The digital PAL value evaluated by the DCS is appropriate, and the use of the DCS is promising in the treatment of postoperative PAL after pulmonary resection.","Mori, Ryo; Yamazaki, Koji; Shoji, Fumihiro; Kouso, Hidenori; Ushijima, Chie; Miura, Naoko; Takenaka, Tomoyoshi; Takeo, Sadanori",PloS one,292,31

Exclusion criteria included pre-existing cerebrovascular diseases, anaemia, baseline pulse oximetry <97% and low quality rSO2 sensor signals. Demographic data, comorbidities, and ASA physical status as well as height and weight were collected prospectively from all patients. Baseline rSO2 values were recorded while the patient breathed room air, using the INVOS 5100C monitor™ (Covidien, Dublin, Ireland). RESULTS Thirty-seven women (72%) and 13 men (28%) 48 ± 13 years of age were enrolled in this study. Baseline rSO2 was 62.01 ± 10.38%. Baseline rSO2 was significantly different between men (67.6 ± 11.2%) and women (60 ± 9.4%), (P=0.023).

BACKGROUND The risk of PMI during CTO PCI may be underestimated because systematic cardiac biomarker measurement was not performed in published studies. METHODS We retrospectively examined PMI among 325 consecutive CTO PCI performed at our institution between 2005 and 2012. Creatine kinase-myocardial band fraction and troponin were measured before PCI and 8 to 12 h and 18 to 24 h after PCI in all patients. PMI was defined as creatine kinase-myocardial band increase ≥ 3 x the upper limit of normal. Major adverse cardiac events during mid-term follow-up were evaluated. RESULTS Mean age was 64 ± 8 years. The retrograde approach was used in 26.8% of all procedures. The technical and procedural success was 77.8% and 76.6%, respectively. PMI occurred in 28 patients (8.6%, 95% confidence intervals: 5.8% to 12.2%), with symptomatic ischemia in 7 of those patients. The incidence of PMI was higher in patients treated with the retrograde than the antegrade approach (13.8% vs. 6.7%, p = 0.04). During a median follow-up of 2.3 years, compared with patients without PMI, those with PMI had a higher incidence of major adverse cardiac events (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.25, p = 0.006). Patients with only asymptomatic PMI also had a higher incidence of major adverse cardiac events on follow-up (HR: 2.26, p = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS Systematic measurement of cardiac biomarkers post-CTO PCI demonstrates that PMI occurs in 8.6% of patients, is more common with the retrograde approach, and is associated with worse subsequent clinical outcomes during mid-term follow-up.","Lo, Nathan; Michael, Tesfaldet T; Moin, Danyaal; Patel, Vishal G; Alomar, Mohammed; Papayannis, Aristotelis; Cipher, Daisha; Abdullah, Shuaib M; Banerjee, Subhash; Brilakis, Emmanouil S",JACC.

Recent evidence showed that NS1 is secreted efficiently from infected mosquito cells. To explore the secretory route of NS1 in mosquito cells, infected cells were treated with brefeldin A (BFA) and methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MβCD). The results showed that MβCD, but not BFA, significantly reduced the release of NS1. Moreover, silencing the expression of caveolin-1 (CAV1; a key component of the caveolar system that transports cholesterol inside the cell), but not SAR1 (a GTPase that participates in the classical secretory pathway), also results in a significant reduction of the secretion of NS1. These results indicate that NS1 is released from mosquito cells via an unconventional secretory route that bypasses the Golgi complex, with the participation of CAV1. In agreement with this notion, differences were observed in the glycosylation status between secreted NS1 and E proteins. Classical mechanics and docking simulations suggested highly favoured interactions between the caveolin-binding domain present in NS1 and the scaffolding domain of CAV1. Finally, proximity ligation assays showed direct interaction between NS1 and CAV1 in infected mosquito cells. These findings are in line with the lipoprotein nature of secreted NS1 and provide new insights into the biology of NS1.","Alcalá, Ana C; Hernández-Bravo, Raiza; Medina, Fernando; Coll, David S; Zambrano, Jose L; Del Angel, Rosa M; Ludert, Juan E",The Journal of general virology,292,1

Embedded in these big data are useful information and valuable knowledge. An example is healthcare and epidemiological data such as data related to patients who suffered from viral diseases like the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Knowledge discovered from these epidemiological data via data science helps researchers, epidemiologists and policy makers to get a better understanding of the disease, which may inspire them to come up ways to detect, control and combat the disease. In this paper, we present a temporal data science algorithm for analyzing big COVID-19 epidemiological data, with focus on the temporal data analytics with ubiquitous computing. The algorithm helps users to get a better understanding of information about the confirmed cases of COVID-19. Evaluation results show the benefits of our system in temporal data analytics of big COVID-19 data with ubiquitous computing. Although the algorithm is designed for temporal data analytics of big epidemiological data, it would be applicable to other temporal data analytics of big data in many real-life applications and services.","Chen, Y.

Methods: We examined individual and joint associations of COVID-19 and preexisting diabetes (DM) with DKA presentation in a retrospective cohort of patients who presented to Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, NY from March to June 2020. We defined DKA as acidosis (pH <7.3 or anion gap ≥ 12), ketosis (positive serum or urinary ketones), and glucose >250 mg/dl. We defined COVID-19 status by PCR test result and preexisting DM by HbA1c ≥6.5%, ICD-10 code, or outpatient DM medications. Given likely bias in hospital presentation during the pandemic, a historical control from March to June 2019 was included in the COVID negative group. Data were analyzed using multivariate regression. Results: We included 46,479 patients: mean age 43 yrs, 56% male, 57% with DM of which 94% type 2 DM. COVID-19 alone was not associated with higher odds of DKA presentation, though as expected preexisting DM was. Adjusted regression analyses for interaction showed 64% higher odds of DKA for patients with both COVID-19 and preexisting DM than the additive effect of each condition alone (Table 1). Conclusions: COVID-19 has a multiplicative effect on the risk of hospital presentation of DKA in people with preexisting DM. Mechanistic studies examining DKA in COVID-19 in people with preexisting DM may help identify preventive targets.","Mathew, J.; Schechter, C.; Southern, W.; Crandall, J.

There is also a high risk of COVID-19 outbreaks in the mental health clinics (hospitals) for children.MethodsThe data from the Municipal Department of Health and Medical records of patients who were treated at the clinic from January to June in 2019 were compared. Statistical processing was carried out using the Chi-Square for 2 x 2 Contingency Table method.ResultsThe study demonstrated the statistically significant difference in the types of mental health conditions that require more attention and in-patient emergency treatment options during the pandemic, including decompensation, exacerbation or manifestation of endogenous diseases, anorexia nervosa and suicidal manifestations. To prevent the spread of infection, a specific separate clinical unit was created for patients with severe mental health disorders and symptoms of COVID-19. Additionally, multiple changes were implemented in treatment protocols, staff duties and interactions with the patients’ caregivers.ConclusionsThere was a higher demand for in-patient emergency treatment for children with severe mental health disorders in 2020, as compared to 2019.

Vaccinations have begun to roll-out; however, restriction policies required during and after the rollout remain uncertain. A susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model was developed for Nova Scotia, and it accounted for the province's policy interventions, demographics, and vaccine rollout schedule. Methods: A modified SEIR model was developed to simulate the spread and outcomes from COVID-19 in Nova Scotia under different policy options. The model incorporated the age distribution and co-morbidity of the province. A system dynamics model was developed in Vensim. Several scenarios were run to determine the effects of various policy options and loosening of restrictions during and after the vaccine roll-out period. Results: When restrictions policy include moderate closure of businesses, restricting travel to Atlantic Canada, and the mandating of masks and physical distancing, the number of cumulative infections after 110 days was less than 120. However, if national travel was opened by July 5 2021 and there were no restrictions by September 2021, the number of active infections will peak at 6,114 by February 16 2022, and there will be a peak of 104 hospitalizations on February 16 2022. Immediate opening of travel and all restrictions on March 15, 2021 will result in 71,731 active infections by June 4 2021. Discussion: Moderate restrictions will be required even after the population is fully vaccinated in order to avoid a large number of infections and hospitalizations because herd immunity is not reached due to children under 12 not being vaccinated, the efficacy of the vaccine, and the portion of the population that will choose not to be vaccinated.","Gillis, M.; Saif, A.; Murphy, M.; Kamal, N.",,292,16

This expansion of ASGM has raised concerns about mercury use and increased the number of projects designed to reduce or eliminate the use of mercury in ASGM in many developing countries. Unfortunately, to date, these projects focusing on substituting mercury with gravity separation or concentration have been relatively unsuccessful due to a lack of continuous support, guidance, and capital. Through a critical examination of the gravity separation and concentration interventions that have been globally implemented in ASGM, the shortcomings and challenges for artisanal miners are addressed. This article highlights how gravity concentration can reduce the amount of material to be amalgamated or treated thermally or chemically to extract gold from concentrates. However, it also acknowledges that this process has the potential to eliminate the use of mercury in very rare, specific cases. Ultimately, this article concludes that gravity concentration is not the final solution to eliminate mercury use in artisanal gold mining, but it can drastically reduce the use of mercury and its release into the environment.","Martinez, Gerardo; Restrepo-Baena, Oscar Jaime; Veiga, Marcello M.",,292,1

Material and Methods: In this study, 100 lead-like chemical entities were downloaded from the ZINC15 database and subjected to structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) in terms of their potential to be used in combating COVID-19. In our molecular docking study, the Mpro (3CLpro) enzyme encoded by the COVID-19 genome was selected as the receptor molecule that could be targeted in the treatment. Results: A total of 3 small molecules (ZINC000000011271, ZINC000000026220 and ZINC000000006645) were identified as potential inhibitors due to their high binding affinities to this enzyme. Physicochemical profiles of the top-ranked ligands, determined in our study, showed that these compounds were safe and had drug-like features. Furthermore, in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, the top-ranked compound ZINC000000011271 was found to strongly bound to the Mpro enzyme and preserved its hydrogen bonding stability throughout the whole trajectory. Discussion: In this study, three orphaned drugs (ZINC000000011271, ZINC000000026220 and ZINC000000006645) were found to strongly inhibit Mpro in molecular simulations.

This paper discusses the governance of the coalition of Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and The Green Party to examine whether the context of the pandemic deflected the Irish public's attention from what was simply a continuation of the Government's normal approach to welfare, housing and healthcare. Therefore, this paper will focus on the coalition's decision to screen and tax recipients of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment, the enactment of housing strategies that have not met the existing issues within the housing market and how previous measures have not provided adequate protection for the healthcare system during the pandemic.In this short article, the Republic of Ireland's government response to the pandemic is revisited after a year of living with coronavirus within the context of welfare, housing and healthcare.

Despite this, the COVID-19 pandemic posed unprecedented challenges to all EPs, including the challenge of how to prepare for and cope with a pandemic. This subset analysis aimed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic specifically on the lives of EP fathers. Methods: From May 2 through June 16, 2020, a convenience sample of physician fathers was surveyed on their personal and professional preparedness for COVID-19. Surveys were distributed via the Physician Dads Group (PDG), an international Facebook group covering all medical specialties, LinkedIn, via personal contacts and professional organizations. Results: 260 surveys were completed by EP fathers (Table 1). Of the respondents, 77% were between 30-49 years, 84% were White, 9% Asian, 1% Black;31 U.S. states were represented. 98% reported they had a partner. At the time of the survey, 63% felt they were in a high-density area with 88% having cared for a COVID+ patient. About half had taken steps to prepare personally or professionally for the local impact of COVID-19 (46% and 67%, respectively). EP fathers’ top two concerns were exposing their partner or their child(ren) to COVID-19, followed by personally acquiring COVID-19. 44% of fathers didn’t have to change their schedule to care for children, while 37% did;other fathers did not have school-aged children or already had care in the home. In terms of preparation, about 67% made sure they had adequate food, 60% made sure they were financially prepared, while 46% and 41% obtained PPE for self or family, respectively. To prepare professionally, almost all (97%) educated themselves about COVID-19, 68% self-educated about pandemics, and 72% reviewed critical care literature. The three biggest professional concerns were morale of staff (48%), financial challenges (45%), and health of staff (43%). 37% of fathers felt that the balance between their professional and personal responsibilities worsened, while 17% felt the balance improved. When EP fathers were asked if they wished they did not go into medicine, 67% disagreed/strongly disagreed. When asked if they wished they had not gone into their specialty, 89% disagreed/strongly disagreed. Conclusions: EP fathers felt more prepared professionally than personally for the pandemic. The findings highlight that EP fathers were concerned about their family becoming sick but also concerned with the health and morale of staff at work.

METHODS The samples for PCT, CRP and IL-6 measurements were obtained on admission or the first day of hospitalization. The etiology of pneumonia was studied with an extensive panel of methods that detected 6 bacteria and 11 viruses. RESULTS In all, 54% had evidence of bacterial pneumonia, and 32% had evidence of sole viral pneumonia. In 14% of the cases the etiology could not be determined. Children with bacterial pneumonia had significantly higher PCT (median 2.09 ng/ml vs. 0.56 ng/ml, P = 0.019) and CRP concentrations (96 mg/l vs. 54 mg/l, P = 0.008) than those with sole viral etiology. However, the values markedly overlapped. No significant difference in IL-6 concentrations was seen between the two patient groups. Using PCT > or = 2.0 ng/ml, CRP > or = 150 mg/l or IL-6 > or = 40 pg/ml, the specificity was > or =80% for bacterial pneumonia. The sensitivities with these cutoff values were 50% for PCT, 31% for CRP and 34% for IL-6. CONCLUSIONS The results indicate that the measurement of serum PCT, CRP and IL-6 has little value in the differentiation of bacterial and viral pneumonia in children. However, in some patients with very high serum PCT, CRP or IL-6 values, bacterial pneumonia is probable.","Toikka, P; Irjala, K; Juvén, T; Virkki, R; Mertsola, J; Leinonen, M; Ruuskanen, O",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,292,28

The aim of the study is to determine the rate of latex sensitisation in our healthcare workers. MATERIALS AND METHODS We recruited 313 healthcare workers, of which 46.6% were operating theatre staff and 53.4% were non-operating theatre staff. Seventy-one administrative staff served as controls. All participants answered a self-administered questionnaire relating to latex exposure and glove-related symptoms. Latex sensitisation was determined by skin prick testing to latex and latex-specific IgE detection. RESULTS The prevalence of latex sensitisation among healthcare workers was 9.6%, with no difference between operating theatre and nonoperating theatre staff. Glove-related symptoms were reported in 13.7% of all healthcare workers, of which 22.9% were sensitised to latex. Only 26.7% of latex-sensitised healthcare workers had glove-related symptoms while the rest were asymptomatic. The most common symptoms were itch and hand eczema but the most important discriminating symptom was contact urticaria. Personal history of atopy was more common in sensitised healthcare workers (40.0%) compared to non-sensitised workers (31.8%). Only 1 out of 9 (11.2%) symptomatic latex-sensitised subjects had sought previous medical attention for the problem. CONCLUSIONS Latex sensitisation among healthcare workers in Singapore should be considered a significant occupational health risk, as it is in the West. Increased screening and awareness of this problem is essential to identify those at risk.","Tang, M B Y; Leow, Y H; Ng, V; Koh, D; Goh, C L","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",292,1

METHODS We retrieved Twitter and Sina Weibo data created within 24 hours of the World Health Organization announcement of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (Batch 1 from August 8, 2014, 06:50:00 Greenwich Mean Time [GMT] to August 9, 2014, 06:49:59 GMT) and seven days later (Batch 2 from August 15, 2014, 06:50:00 GMT to August 16, 2014, 06:49:59 GMT). We obtained and analyzed a 1% random sample of tweets containing the keyword Ebola. We retrieved all Sina Weibo posts with Chinese keywords for Ebola for analysis. We analyzed changes in frequencies of keywords, hashtags, and Web links using relative risk (RR) and c(2) feature selection algorithm. We identified misinformation by manual coding and categorizing randomly selected sub-datasets. RESULTS We identified two speculative treatments (i.e., bathing in or drinking saltwater and ingestion of Nano Silver, an experimental drug) in our analysis of changes in frequencies of keywords and hashtags. Saltwater was speculated to be protective against Ebola in Batch 1 tweets but their mentions decreased in Batch 2 (RR=0.11 for ""salt"" and RR=0.14 for ""water""). Nano Silver mentions were higher in Batch 2 than in Batch 1 (RR=10.5). In our manually coded samples, Ebola-related misinformation constituted about 2% of Twitter and Sina Weibo content. A range of 36%-58% of the posts were news about the Ebola outbreak and 19%-24% of the posts were health information and responses to misinformation in both batches. In Batch 2, 43% of Chinese microblogs focused on the Chinese government sending medical assistance to Guinea. CONCLUSION Misinformation about Ebola was circulated at a very low level globally in social media in either batch. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of social media posts can provide relevant information to public health agencies during emergency responses.","Fung, Isaac Chun-Hai; Fu, King-Wa; Chan, Chung-Hong; Chan, Benedict Shing Bun; Cheung, Chi-Ngai; Abraham, Thomas; Tse, Zion Tsz Ho",Public health reports,292,26

However, rates of long-term PA participation are often poor. PURPOSE This study examined the effect of an intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) on objectively assessed PA for a 4-yr period among older adults with type 2 diabetes. METHODS Data from 2400 participants (age = 59.3 ± 6.9 yr, body mass index = 36.1 ± 5.9 kg·m) with accelerometry data from the Look AHEAD trial were included in the analyses. Participants randomized to ILI were instructed to reduce caloric intake and progress to ≥175 min·wk of moderate-to-vigorous-intensity PA (MVPA), whereas those randomized to Diabetes Support and Education (DSE) served as the control group. PA was measured at baseline, year 1, and year 4 using an RT3 accelerometer, and bout-related MVPA (PA ≥3 METs, accumulated in bouts of ≥10 min in duration) was calculated. RESULTS Despite no differences at baseline (ILI = 93.4 ± 152.7 vs DSE = 88.4 ± 143.6 min·wk), bout-related MVPA was significantly greater in ILI compared with DSE at year 1 (151.0 ± 213.5 vs 87.5 ± 145.1 min·wk, P < 0.0001) and year 4 (102.9 ± 195.6 vs 73.9 ± 267.5 min·wk, P < 0.001), and more ILI participants achieved ≥175 min·wk at year 1 (29.1% vs 16.3%, P < 0.001) and year 4 (18.3% vs 10.0%, P < 0.001). Forty-one percent of ILI participants who achieved ≥175 min·wk at year 1 maintained this threshold of PA at year 4. However, the majority of ILI participants never achieved the ≥175 min·wk threshold. CONCLUSIONS When measured objectively and compared with DSE, ILI engaged in significantly more bout-related MVPA for a 4-yr period. However, future intervention strategies should target the large percentage of individuals who fail to reach the MVPA goal as result of a lifestyle intervention.","Unick, Jessica L; Gaussoin, Sarah A; Hill, James O; Jakicic, John M; Bond, Dale S; Hellgren, Margareta; Johnson, Karen C; Peters, Anne L; Coday, Mace; Kitzman, Dalane W; Bossart, Suzette; Wing, Rena R",Medicine and science in sports and exercise,292,7

Risk factors were incarceration (odds ratio [OR], 1.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00-3.67), African American race/ethnicity (OR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.28-2.87), and residence at a group of geographically proximate public housing complexes (OR, 2.50; 95% CI, 1.25-4.98); older age was inversely related (OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.82-0.96 [for each decade increase]). Of 73 strains tested, 79% were pulsed-field gel electrophoresis type USA300. CONCLUSIONS Clonal CA-MRSA infection has emerged among Chicago's urban poor. It has occurred in addition to, not in place of, methicillin-susceptible S aureus infection. Epidemiological analysis suggests that control measures could focus initially on core groups that have contributed disproportionately to risk, although CA-MRSA becomes endemic as it disseminates within communities.","Hota, Bala; Ellenbogen, Charlotte; Hayden, Mary K; Aroutcheva, Alla; Rice, Thomas W; Weinstein, Robert A",Archives of internal medicine,292,26

Among the farms, Farm A showed a high antibody incidence. We could not confirm if either TGEV or porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) induced the antibodies, since conventional tests failed to discriminate PRCV from TGEV. Therefore, we conducted virological and serological examinations of this farm for 4 years to establish the etiology - TGEV or PRCV. Although no TGEV was detected, PRCVs were isolated from the nasal samples of pigs. Using a commercial ELISA kit, it was found that the antibodies detected in pigs of all the raising stages and sows were raised against PRCV but not TGEV. The phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequences of the isolates showed that they were closely related to each other, and formed a separate cluster apart from the U.S.A. and European strains. In Cesarean-derived, colostrums-deprived piglets inoculated with a PRCV isolate, no clinical signs were seen, and the viruses were mainly isolated from the nasal samples. Moreover, viral genes were detected from the nasal sample of the contact pig. The result suggested that PRCV infection was located in the nasal cavity of pigs, and horizontal transmission easily occurs. From these results, PRCVs with different origins from the exotic PRCVs might be prevalent in pig farms in Japan.","Usami, Yoshihide; Fukai, Katsuhiko; Ichikawa, Yutaka; Okuda, Yo; Shibata, Isao; Motoyama, Chihiro; Imai, Kunitoshi; Kirisawa, Rikio",The Journal of veterinary medical science,292,1

Design Multicentre retrospective observational cohort study. Setting Three multidisciplinary intensive care units (ICUs) in Hong Kong. Participants All adult critically ill patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to ICUs in Hong Kong between 22 January and 11 February 2020. Main outcome measure 28-day mortality. Results Eight out of 49 patients with COVID-19 (16%) were admitted to Hong Kong ICUs during the study period. The median age was 64.5 years (range, 42–70) with a median admission Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 6 (IQR, 4–7). Six patients (75%) required mechanical ventilation, six patients (75%) required vasopressors and two (25%) required renal replacement therapy. None of the patients required prone ventilation, nitric oxide or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The median times to shock reversal and extubation were 9 and 11 days respectively. At 28 days, one patient (12%) had died and the remaining seven (88%) all survived to ICU discharge. Only one of the survivors (14%) still required oxygen at 28 days. Conclusion Critically ill patients with COVID-19 often require a moderate duration of mechanical ventilation and vasopressor support. Most of these patients recover and survive to ICU discharge with supportive care using lung protective ventilation strategies, avoiding excess fluids, screening and treating bacterial co-infection, and timely intubation.

METHODS: The medical records of 4158 dental emergency patients in 2019 and 2020 were retrospectively analyzed and divided into pre-SARS-COV-2 group and SARS-COV-2 group according to time. The demographic data, date and time, diagnosis, and treatment methods of the two groups were statistically described, and the chi-squared test was used to analyze the differences. The medical records of 4158 dental emergency patients during the same period of two years in 2019 and 2020 were retrospectively analyzed and divided into SARS-COV-2 pre-group and SARS-COV-2 group according to time. The demographic data, date and time, diagnosis and treatment methods of the two groups were statistically described, and the chi-square test was used to determine the differences. RESULTS: During the SARS-COV-2 pandemic, the number of dental emergency visits increased by 29.7%. During the pandemic, males (n = 286, 58.1%) were more likely to visit dental emergency centers for trauma than females (n = 206, 41.9%) (P < 0.05); females (n = 242, 60.8%) were more likely to visit dental emergency centers for acute gingivitis and acute pericoronitis than males (n = 156, 39.2%) (P < 0.05). A major change in diagnosis was related to acute pulpitis (K04.0) and acute apical periodontitis (K04.4), which increased by 9.2%; acute gingivitis (K05.0) and acute pericoronitis (K05.2) increased by 3.5%; open wound of the lip and oral cavity (S01.5) decreased by 17.9%; other conditions (non-emergency diseases) increased by 6.8%, compared with the pre-SARS-COV-2 period. Among the treatment modalities, during the pre-SARS-COV-2 period, 304 patients (17.7%) received a prescription for antibiotics and analgesics, and 1485 (86.5%) received a prescription for local treatment. During the SARS-COV-2 period, 958 (39.2%) received a prescription for antibiotics and analgesics, and 1636 (67.0%) received a prescription for local treatment. CONCLUSION: SARS-COV-2 pandemic led to changes in the characteristics of dental emergency patients. Trauma, acute pulpitis, and acute periodontitis are the leading reasons patients refer to dental emergency centers. Dental emergency centers should optimize treatment procedures, optimize the staff, and reasonably allocate materials according to the changes to improve the on-site treatment capacity and provide adequate dental emergency care.","Wu, Kan; Li, Chunjie; Yang, Zheng; Yang, Shangchun; Yang, Wenbing; Hua, Chengge",BMC Oral Health,292,20

Excess mortality varied widely among municipalities even within the same region; it was higher among the elderly and higher in males except in the &#8805;75 age group. Thus, nearby municipalities may show a different mortality burden despite being under common regional health policies, possibly as a result of local reinforcements of regional policies. Identifying the municipalities where mortality was higher and the pathways used by the virus to spread may help to concentrate efforts in understanding the reasons why this happened and to identify the frailest areas in light of recurrences of the epidemic.","Gibertoni, Dino; Adja, Kadjo Yves Cedric; Golinelli, Davide; Reno, Chiara; Regazzi, Luca; Lenzi, Jacopo; Sanmarchi, Francesco; Fantini, Maria Pia",Health Place,292,30

Several studies have already described acute limb ischemia and peripheral arterial disease in critically ill patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), as well as coronary artery disease and ischemic stroke as a manifestation usually associated with respiratory distress. However, what still remains unclear is how long inflammation and thrombotic derangements can last after recovery from the symptoms of Covid-19. Hence, in this article we report 3 cases of arterial thrombotic sequalae after this viral infection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first cases' series that had described different delayed vascular arterial complications, which occurred after the index infection, with a negative nasopharyngeal swab and Covid-19 systemic symptoms resumption. A better understanding of the coagulopathy in Covid-19 could have an essential role to guide prevention and treatment of arterial thromboembolic events, both during and after the viral infection. Further investigations are required to confirm these data and to estabilish the type, dose and duration of anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapy not just during but also after Covid-19 infection.","Borrelli, Maria Pia; Buora, Adelaide; Scrivere, Paola; Sponza, Massimo; Frigatti, Paolo",Ann. vasc. surg,292,16

Recent work has shown how audio based approaches, which collect respiratory audio data (cough, breathing and voice) can be used for testing, however there is a lack of exploration of how biases and methodological decisions impact these tools' performance in practice. In this paper, we explore the realistic performance of audio-based digital testing of COVID-19. To investigate this, we collected a large crowdsourced respiratory audio dataset through a mobile app, alongside recent COVID-19 test result and symptoms intended as a ground truth. Within the collected dataset, we selected 5,240 samples from 2,478 participants and split them into different participant-independent sets for model development and validation. Among these, we controlled for potential confounding factors (such as demographics and language). The unbiased model takes features extracted from breathing, coughs, and voice signals as predictors and yields an AUC-ROC of 0.71 (95\% CI: 0.65$-$0.77). We further explore different unbalanced distributions to show how biases and participant splits affect performance. Finally, we discuss how the realistic model presented could be integrated in clinical practice to realize continuous, ubiquitous, sustainable and affordable testing at population scale.","Han, Jing; Xia, Tong; Spathis, Dimitris; Bondareva, Erika; Brown, Chloe; Chauhan, Jagmohan; Dang, Ting; Grammenos, Andreas; Hasthanasombat, Apinan; Floto, Andres; Cicuta, Pietro; Mascolo, Cecilia",,292,20

METHODS: Data from the national case-based surveillance system of confirmed COVID-19 infections until May 8, 2020, were analyzed. Demographic and clinical characteristics of subjects were summarized by age groups (0-1, 2-6, 7-12, 13-18 years), and risk factors for disease severity were evaluated by using a multilevel (clustered by region) multivariable logistic regression model. Furthermore, a comparison among children, adults, and elderly was performed. RESULTS: Pediatric patients (3836) accounted for 1.8% of total infections (216 305); the median age was 11 years, 51.4% were male, 13.3% were hospitalized, and 5.4% presented underlying medical conditions. The disease was mild in 32.4% of cases and severe in 4.3%, particularly in children &#8804;6 years old (10.8%); among 511 hospitalized patients, 3.5% were admitted in ICU, and 4 deaths occurred. Lower risk of disease severity was associated with increasing age and calendar time, whereas a higher risk was associated with preexisting underlying medical conditions (odds ratio = 2.80, 95% confidence interval = 1.74-4.48). Hospitalization rate, admission in ICU, disease severity, and days from symptoms onset to recovery significantly increased with age among children, adults and elderly. CONCLUSIONS: Data suggest that pediatric cases of COVID-19 are less severe than adults; however, age &#8804;1 year and the presence of underlying conditions represent severity risk factors. A better understanding of the infection in children may give important insights into disease pathogenesis, health care practices, and public health policies.","Bellino, Stefania; Punzo, Ornella; Rota, Maria Cristina; Del Manso, Martina; Urdiales, Alberto Mateo; Andrianou, Xanthi; Fabiani, Massimo; Boros, Stefano; Vescio, Fenicia; Riccardo, Flavia; Bella, Antonino; Filia, Antonietta; Rezza, Giovanni; Villani, Alberto; Pezzotti, Patrizio",Pediatrics,292,16

Outbreak in a large urban region, Miami-Dade County, Florida, USA is used as a case study. Results are intended to serve as a planning guide for decision makers. Methods: The simulation model mimics daily social mixing behavior of the susceptible and infected generating the spread. Data representing demographics of the region, virus epidemiology, and social interventions shapes model behavior. Results include daily values of infected, reported, hospitalized, and dead. Results: Results show that early implementation of complete stay-at-home order is effective in flattening and reversing the infection growth curve in a short period of time. Whereas, using Florida's Phase II plan alone could result in 75% infected and end of pandemic via herd immunity. Universal use of face masks reduced infected by 20%. A further reduction of 66% was achieved by adding contact tracing with a target of identifying 50% of the asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic. Conclusions: In the absence of a vaccine, the strict stay-at-home order, though effective in curbing a pandemic outbreak, leaves a large proportion of the population susceptible. Hence, there should be a strong follow up plan of social distancing, use of face mask, contact tracing, testing, and isolation of infected to minimize the chances of large-scale resurgence of the disease. However, as the economic cost of the complete stay-at-home-order is very high, it can perhaps be used only as an emergency first response, and the authorities should be prepared to activate a strong follow up plan as soon as possible. The target level for contact tracing was shown to have a nonlinear impact on the reduction of the percentage of population infected. Increase in contact tracing target from 20% to 30% appeared to provide the largest incremental benefit.","Tatapudi, Hanisha; Das, Rachita; Das, Tapas K",Glob Epidemiol,292,1

Hence, the purpose of this study was to examine the association between neighborhood SED, weight status, and fat mass in a diverse sample of youth, before and after controlling for physical activity and diet. (2) Methods: The sample included 828 youth from the Transitions and Activity Changes in Kids study. Neighborhood SED was expressed as an index score at the census tract of residence. Height, weight, and body composition were measured and used to calculate fat mass index (FMI) and weight status. Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and sedentary behavior (min/h) were measured via accelerometry. Diet quality was assessed via the Block Food Screener for Kids. Multilevel regression models were employed to examine these relationships. (3) Results: Neighborhood SED was significantly associated with FMI and weight status before and after controlling for MVPA, sedentary behavior, and diet. Notably, youth residing in the most deprived neighborhoods had significantly higher FMI and were 30% more likely to be overweight/obese (OR = 1.30; 95% CI = 1.03-1.65).

The French government has made the choice of confinement and remote monitoring of patients, with recourse to the healthcare system only when signs of worsening appear (hospitalisation). But in Marseille, a hospital research centre (IHU, led by Pr. Raoult) decided to apply the doctrine of ‘test and treat’ using hydroxychloroquine. This chapter explores the effects of this decision on local doctors’ practices relative to COVID-19. We will show the dilemmas faced by doctors: how they navigate the controversy over hydroxychloroquine as well as negotiate with their patients’ demand for testing and treatment with hydroxychloroquine. This chapter constitutes a first attempt at bringing together the results of a wider research project involving analysis several surveys and interviews conducted among GPs in Marseille and 1200 GPs in France, an analysis of the coverage of the hydroxychloroquine debate in the French national press and surveys conducted among representative samples of the French population. It will also draw on one of the authors’ experience of being a general practitioner in Marseille. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, Deborah Lupton and Karen Willis.","Lutaud, R.; Ward, J.

However, due to the absence of large-scale race-based data, it is impossible to measure the extent to which immigrant and racialized communities are experiencing the pandemic and the impact of measures taken (or not) to mitigate these impacts, especially at a local level. To address this issue, the Ottawa Local Immigration Partnership partnered with the Collaborative Critical Research for Equity and Transformation in Health lab at the University of Ottawa and the Canadians of African Descent Health Organization to implement a project to build local organizational capacities to understand, monitor, and mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on immigrant and racialized populations. This research note describes the working framework used for this project, proposed indicators for measuring the determinants of health among immigrant and racialized populations, and the data gaps we encountered. Recommendations are made to policymakers, and community and health stakeholders at all levels on how to collect and use data to address COVID-19 health inequities, including data collection strategies aimed at community engagement in the collection of disaggregated data, improving methods for collecting and analyzing data on immigrants and racialized groups and policies to enable and enhance data disaggregation. Résumé Des plus en plus d’études montrent que le risque et le fardeau des infections à la COVID-19 ne sont pas également répartis dans la population et que les communautés racialisées connaissent des taux de morbidité et de mortalité disproportionnellement plus élevés.

Like other specialties, Interventional Radiology (IR) rapidly adapted to the evolving situation. Members of BSIR were surveyed to obtain a snapshot of the experiences of UK IRs in response to COVID-19. An electronic survey was compiled using Google Forms, approved by the BSIR Council Officers and distributed to BSIR members by email on 18 th April 2020. A total of 228 responses were received. The survey was open for a 14-day period and the data analysed in Microsoft Excel 365. The response rate was 29% (228/800). RESULTS: Two thirds of respondents work in a Tertiary unit and 33% deliver IR in a District Hospital. 84% have a day-case facility. After the COVID-19 crisis, 81% of respondents were able to maintain 24-7 On-call service. 59% of respondents had been required change their day to day practice to allow the on-call service to continue. 55% of respondents were involved in providing a central line service. Of those questioned, 91% continued to offer endovascular services, 98% genitourinary and 92% hepatobiliary services, although a degree of service reduction was described. 38% have provided IR trainees with additional training material during this pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: This survey has confirmed that the responses of UK IR departments to the COVID-19 crisis have ensured vital on-call and urgent services have continued, including ongoing availability of most IR sub-specialties. Availability of a day case facility has possibly influenced the positive response.","Rostampour, Sammy; Cleveland, Trevor; White, Hilary; Haslam, Philip; McCafferty, Ian; Hamady, Mo",CVIR Endovasc,292,20

An excessive host inflammatory response in a subgroup of patients with severe COVID-19 might contribute to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiorgan failure. Timely therapeutic intervention with immunomodulation in patients with hyperinflammation could prevent disease progression to ARDS and obviate the need for invasive ventilation. Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is an immunoregulatory cytokine with a pivotal role in initiation and perpetuation of inflammatory diseases. GM-CSF could link T-cell-driven acute pulmonary inflammation with an autocrine, self-amplifying cytokine loop leading to monocyte and macrophage activation. This axis has been targeted in cytokine storm syndromes and chronic inflammatory disorders. Here, we consider the scientific rationale for therapeutic targeting of GM-CSF in COVID-19-associated hyperinflammation. Since GM-CSF also has a key role in homoeostasis and host defence, we discuss potential risks associated with inhibition of GM-CSF in the context of viral infection and the challenges of doing clinical trials in this setting, highlighting in particular the need for a patient risk-stratification algorithm.","Mehta, Puja; Porter, Joanna C; Manson, Jessica J; Isaacs, John D; Openshaw, Peter J M; McInnes, Iain B; Summers, Charlotte; Chambers, Rachel C",Lancet Respir Med,292,13

Preventive measures to avoid infections are therefore particularly important for individuals engaging in behavioral risk factors. We seek to determine whether behavioral risk factors (BRFs) play a significant role in the adherence to preventive COVID-19 measures in a population aged 50 and above. The SHARE wave 8 (Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe) and SHARE COVID-19 Survey served as the database, resulting in an analytical sample of 17,588 respondents from 23 European countries plus Israel. Of these 36.04% engaged in at least one BRF and 16.68% engaged in 3 or more BRFs. Multilevel logistic regressions revealed that engagement in one BRF was significantly associated with less adherence to hygiene preventive measures, i.e., hand-sanitizing, hand-washing and covering coughs and sneezes (OR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.78; 0.94), as was engagement in two BRFs (OR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.74; 0.97) and three or more BRFs (OR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.59; 0.88). No such association was found between engagement in BRFs and adherences to social isolation preventive measures, i.e., avoiding meeting more than five people, visiting others or going shopping, or regulated preventive measures, i.e., wearing a mask and keeping physical distance. The found association was also stronger when three or more BRFs were engaged in (1 vs. 3 BRFs: &#967;2 = 3.43, p = 0.06; 2 vs. 3 BRFs: &#967;2 = 6.05; p = 0.01). The study gives insight into the protective behavior of a population with inherent vulnerability during a global health emergency.

During the current scenario, reducing the human to human contact in hospitals is required. In a bid to prevent doctors and medical staff from getting affected by Coronavirus the role of medicine delivering robots are evolving. We can attain the locomotion procedure of the robot using the principle of Radio-frequency identification (RFID) that automatically identifies and tracks tags attached to the objects. The movement and finding the path to patient location is done through a line follower and with RFID tag. Line following method is used to identify the path with help of two infrared sensors. The robot will move towards the patient's room by following a non reflective line and use RFID cards to identify the patient's room number. Using the vending machine the medicine delivery is made possible to the patients. All the measured parameters will be stored to the cloud using the application of the Internet of Thinking (IoT). All the data will successfully be sent to the cloud through the Node MCU.

However, although contributing to a thriving market, innovation in caper cropping is low. The aim of the study was to evaluate agronomic and production behavior of some biotypes of Capparis spinosa L. subsp. rupestris, identified on the Island of Linosa (Italy) for growing purposes. Two years and seven biotypes of the species were tested in a randomized complete block design. The main morphological and production parameters were determined. Phenological stages were also observed. Analysis of variance showed high variability between the biotypes. Principal component analysis and cluster analysis highlighted a clear distinction between biotypes based on biometric and production characteristics. Production data collected in the two-year period 2007–2008 showed the greatest production levels in the third year following planting in 2005. In particular, biotype SCP1 had the highest average value (975.47 g) of flower bud consistency. Our results permitted the identification of biotypes of interest for the introduction into new caper fields.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of patients with COVID-19 admitted from 26th February, who had been discharged or died, up to 29th April, 2020. A descriptive study and an analysis of factors associated with intrahospital mortality were performed. RESULTS: Out of the 101 patients, 96 were analysed. Of these, 79 (82%) recovered and were discharged, and 17 (18%) died in the hospital. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction to SARS-CoV-2 in 92 (92.5%). The mean age was 63 years, and 66% were male. The most frequent comorbidities were hypertension (40%), diabetes mellitus (16%) and cardiopathy (14%). Patients who died were older (mean 77 vs 60 years), had higher prevalence of hypertension (71% vs 33%), and cardiopathy (47% vs 6%), and higher levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and reactive C protein (mean 662 vs 335UI/L, and 193 vs 121mg/L respectively) on admission. In a multivariant analysis the variables significantly associated to mortality were the presence of cardiopathy (CI 95% OR 2,58-67,07), levels of LDH&#8805;345IU/L (CI 95% OR 1,52-46,00), and age&#8805;65 years (CI 95% OR 1,23-44,62). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of cardiopathy, levels of LDH&#8805;345IU/L and age &#8805;65 years are associated with a higher risk of death during hospital stay for COVID-19.

Here, we introduce a novel computational approach that applies deep-learning based protein embedding techniques to analyze BCR repertoires. By selecting the most frequently occurring BCR sequences in a given repertoire and computing the sum of the vector representations of these sequences, we represent an entire repertoire as a 100-dimensional vector and eventually as a single data point in vector space. We demonstrate that our new approach enables us to not only accurately cluster repertoires of COVID-19 patients and healthy subjects, but also efficiently track minute changes in immunity conditions as patients undergo a course of treatment over time. Furthermore, using the distributed representations, we successfully trained an XG-Boost classification model that achieved over 87% mean accuracy rate given a repertoire of CDR3 sequences.","Kim, Inyoung; Byun, Sang Yoon; Kim, Sangyeup; Choi, Sangyoon; Noh, Jinsung; Chung, Junho; Kim, Byung Gee",,292,16

The antiviral activity of 3D8 scFv against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses was evaluated in Vero E6 cell cultures. Viral growth was quantified with quantitative RT-qPCR and plaque assay. The nucleic acid-hydrolyzing activity of 3D8 was assessed through abzyme assays of in vitro viral transcripts and cell viability was determined by MTT assay. We found that 3D8 inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV-2, human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). Our results revealed the prophylactic and therapeutic effects of 3D8 scFv against SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells.

Emerging evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 which causes COVID-19 can be spread through airborne transmission, particularly in indoor environments with poor ventilation. Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems can play a role in mitigating airborne virus transmission. We conducted a systematic review of the scientific literature examining the effectiveness of HVAC design features in reducing virus transmission; here we report results for ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Following international standards for systematic reviews, we conducted a comprehensive search and synthesized findings from 32 relevant studies published between 1936 and 2020. Research demonstrates that: viruses and bacteriophages are inactivated by UV radiation; increasing UV dose is associated with decreasing survival fraction of viruses and bacteriophages; increasing relative humidity is associated with decreasing susceptibility to UV radiation; UV dose and corresponding survival fraction are affected by airflow pattern, air changes per hour, and UV device location; and UV radiation is associated with decreased transmission in both animal and human studies. This comprehensive synthesis of the scientific evidence examining the impact of UV radiation on virus transmission can be used to guide implementation of systems to mitigate airborne spread and identify priorities for future research.","Thornton, Gail M.; Fleck, Brian A; Fleck, Natalie; Kroeker, Emily; Dandnayak, Dhyey; Zhong, Lexuan; Hartling, Lisa",,292,21

The association between hepatic steatosis, which frequently accompanies obesity, and the pneumonia severity score (PSS) evaluated on computed tomography (CT), and the prevalence of steatosis in patients with COVID-19 remains to be elucidated. AIM: To assess the frequency of hepatic steatosis in the chest CT of COVID-19 patients and its association with the PSS. METHODS: The chest CT images of 485 patients who were admitted to the emergency department with suspected COVID-19 were retrospectively evaluated. The patients were divided into two groups as COVID-19-positive [CT- and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-positive] and controls (CT- and RT-PCR-negative). The CT images of both groups were evaluated for PSS as the ratio of the volume of involved lung parenchyma to the total lung volume. Hepatic steatosis was defined as a liver attenuation value of &lt;= 40 Hounsfield units (HU). RESULTS: Of the 485 patients, 56.5% (n = 274) were defined as the COVID-19-positive group and 43.5% (n = 211) as the control group. The average age of the COVID-19-positive group was significantly higher than that of the control group (50.9 +/- 10.9 years vs 40.4 +/- 12.3 years, P &lt; 0.001). The frequency of hepatic steatosis in the positive group was significantly higher compared with the control group (40.9% vs 19.4%, P &lt; 0.001). The average hepatic attenuation values were significantly lower in the positive group compared with the control group (45.7 +/- 11.4 HU vs 53.9 +/- 15.9 HU, P &lt; 0.001). Logistic regression analysis showed that after adjusting for age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, overweight, and obesity there was almost a 2.2 times greater odds of hepatic steatosis in the COVID-19-positive group than in the controls (odds ratio 2.187;95% confidence interval: 1.336-3.580, P &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of hepatic steatosis was significantly higher in COVID-19 patients compared with controls after adjustment for age and comorbidities. This finding can be easily assessed on chest CT images.","Tahtabasi, M.; Hosbul, T.; Karaman, E.; Akin, Y.; Kilicaslan, N.; Gezer, M.; Sahiner, F.",World Journal of Critical Care Medicine,292,0

However, how MXYG acts against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not known. We investigated the active ingredients and the therapeutic targets of MXYG decoction against COVID-19. METHODS: A network pharmacology strategy involving drug-likeness evaluation, prediction of oral bioavailability, network analyses, and virtual molecular docking were used to predict the mechanism of action of MXYG against COVID-19. RESULTS: Thirty-three core COVID-19-related targets were identified from 1023 gene targets through analyses of protein- protein interactions. Eighty-six active ingredients of MXYG decoction hit by 19 therapeutic targets were screened out by analyses of a compound-compound target network. Via network topology, three ""hub"" gene targets (interleukin (IL-6), caspase-3, IL-4) and three key components (quercetin, formononetin, luteolin) were recognized and verified by molecular docking. Compared with control compounds (ribavirin, arbidol), the docking score of quercetin to the IL-6 receptor was highest, with a score of 5. Furthermore, the scores of three key components to SARS-CoV-2 are large as 4, 5, and 5, respectively, which are even better than those of ribavirin at 3. Bioinformatics analyses revealed that MXYG could prevent and treat COVID-19 through anti-inflammatory and immunity-based actions involving activation of T cells, lymphocytes, and leukocytes, as well as cytokine-cytokine-receptor interaction, and chemokine signaling pathways. CONCLUSION: The hub genes of COVID-19 helped to reveal the underlying pathogenesis and therapeutic targets of COVID19. This study represents the first report on the molecular mechanism of MXYG decoction against COVID-19.","Wang, Mingzhu; Fu, Deyu; Yao, Lei; Li, Jianhua",,292,26

Currently, different therapies active on the immune system are used for the management of COVID-19. The involvement of the immune system also opens the opportunity for the use of nutritional supplements with antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activity. MAIN ASPECTS: Nutritional supplements with antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activity are promising therapeutic adjuvants for the treatment of COVID-19, and also for the prevention of viral spreading. In particular, the role of vitamin D, probiotics, lactoferrin, and zinc is of significant clinical interest, although there are only a few data on their use in COVID-19 patients. Their molecular actions, together with the results of studies performed on other respiratory infections, strongly suggest their potential utility in COVID-19. This article discusses the main properties of these nutritional supplements and their potential applicability in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.

These metamorphic proteins are characterized by having two or more folds with significant differences in their secondary structure, in which each fold is stabilized by a distinct local environment. So far, â¼90 metamorphic proteins have been identified in the Protein Databank, but we and others hypothesize that a far greater number of metamorphic proteins remain undiscovered. In this work, we introduce a computational model to predict metamorphic behavior in proteins using only knowledge of the sequence. In this model, secondary structure prediction programs are used to calculate diversity indices, which are measures of uncertainty in predicted secondary structure at each position in the sequence; these are then used to assign protein sequences as likely to be metamorphic versus monomorphic (i.e., having just one fold). We constructed a reference data set to train our classification method, which includes a novel compilation of 136 likely monomorphic proteins and a set of 201 metamorphic protein structures taken from the literature. Our model is able to classify proteins as metamorphic versus monomorphic with a Matthews correlation coefficient of â¼0.36 and true positive/true negative rates of â¼65%/80%, suggesting that it is possible to predict metamorphic behavior in proteins using only sequence information.","Chen, Nanhao; Das, Madhurima; LiWang, Andy; Wang, Lee-Ping",Biophys. j,292,16

In some problems quantiles are elicited from experts and used for fitting parametric models, which induce non-elicited information. In some other problems comparisons are made with a quantile of an assumed model which is noncommittal to the quantile information. The maximum entropy (ME) principle provides models that avoid these issues. However, the information theory literature has been mainly concerned about models based on moment information. This paper explores the ME models that are the minimum elaborations of the uniform and moment-based ME models by quantiles. This property provides diagnostics for the utility of elaboration in terms of the information value of each type of information over the other. The ME model with quantiles and moments is represented as the mixture of truncated distributions on consecutive intervals whose shapes and existence are determined by the moments. Elaborations of several ME distributions by quantiles are presented. The ME model based only on quantiles elicited by the fixed interval method possesses a useful property for pooling information elicited from multiple experts. The elaboration of Laplace distribution is an extension of the information theory connection with minimum risk under symmetric loss functions to the asymmetric linear loss. This extension produces a new Asymmetric Laplace distribution. Application examples compare ME priors with a parametric model fitted to elicited quantiles, illustrate measuring uncertainty and disagreement of economic forecasters based on elicited probabilities, and adjust ME models for a fundamental quantile in an inventory management problem.","Bajgiran, Amirsaman H; Mardikoraem, Mahsa; Soofi, Ehsan S",European journal of operational research,292,1

Together, tissue expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 may determine infection. Sex, age, body mass index (BMI), and CKD are clinical risk factors for COVID-19 severity, but the relationships between kidney ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression and these clinical variables are unknown. Accordingly, we obtained renal tubulointerstitial and glomerular microarray expression data and clinical variables from healthy living donors (HLD) and patients with CKD from the European Renal cDNA Bank. ACE2 expression was similar in the tubulointerstitium of the two groups, but greater in females than males in HLD (P = 0.005) and CKD (P < 0.0001). ACE2 expression was lower in glomeruli of CKD patients compared to HLD (P = 0.0002) and lower in males than females. TMPRSS2 expression was similar in the tubulointerstitium but lower in glomeruli of CKD patients compared to HLD (P < 0.0001). There was a strong relationship between ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in the glomerulus (r = 0.51, P < 0.0001). In CKD, there was a relationship between tubulointerstitial ACE2 expression and estimated glomerular filtration rate (r = 0.36, P < 0.0001) and age (r = -0.17, P = 0.03), but no relationship with BMI. There were no relationships between TMPRSS2 expression and clinical variables. Genes involved in inflammation (CCL2, IL6, and TNF) and fibrosis (COL1A1, TGFB1, and FN1) were inversely correlated with ACE2 expression.

METHODS: A systematic review was executed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. To identify articles related to COVID-19 and CHD, an extensive literature search was performed on EMBASE, Medline, Scopus, and Global Health databases using keywords and MeSH terms. RESULTS: A total of 12 articles met the inclusion criteria and were included for analysis in this systematic review. Two themes were identified for data extraction: evidence supporting higher risks in CHD patients and evidence against higher risks in CHD patients. After combining the data, there were 99 patients with CHDs out of which 12 required admissions to ICU. CONCLUSION: This systematic review suggests that CHD may increase the risk of poor outcomes for those with COVID-19, but also highlights the necessity for more research with larger sample sizes in order to make a more justified conclusion, as the majority of papers that were analysed were case series and case reports. Future research should aim to quantify the risks if possible whilst accounting for various confounding factors such as age and treatment history.","Haiduc, Ana Alina; Ogunjimi, Michael; Shammus, Rohma; Mahmood, Saira; Kutty, Ramesh; Lotto, Attilio; Guerrero, Rafael; Harky, Amer; Dhannapuneni, Ram",Cardiol Young,292,16

We aimed to compare the performance of the NEWS and NEWS2 in patients with COVID-19 versus those without during the first phase of the pandemic. DESIGN: A retrospective cross-sectional study. SETTING: Two acute hospitals (Scarborough and York) are combined into a single dataset and analysed collectively. PARTICIPANTS: Adult (&#8805;18 years) non-elective admissions discharged between 11 March 2020 and 13 June 2020 with an index or on-admission NEWS2 electronically recorded within ±24 hours of admission to predict mortality at four time points (in-hospital, 24 hours, 48 hours and 72 hours) in COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 admissions. RESULTS: Out of 6480 non-elective admissions, 620 (9.6%) had a diagnosis of COVID-19. They were older (73.3 vs 67.7 years), more often male (54.7% vs 50.1%), had higher index NEWS (4 vs 2.5) and NEWS2 (4.6 vs 2.8) scores and higher in-hospital mortality (32.1% vs 5.8%). The c-statistics for predicting in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 admissions was significantly lower using NEWS (0.64 vs 0.74) or NEWS2 (0.64 vs 0.74), however, these differences reduced at 72hours (NEWS: 0.75 vs 0.81; NEWS2: 0.71 vs 0.81), 48 hours (NEWS: 0.78 vs 0.81; NEWS2: 0.76 vs 0.82) and 24hours (NEWS: 0.84 vs 0.84; NEWS2: 0.86 vs 0.84). Increasing NEWS2 values reflected increased mortality, but for any given value the absolute risk was on average 24% higher (eg, NEWS2=5: 36% vs 9%). CONCLUSIONS: The index or on-admission NEWS and NEWS2 offers lower discrimination for COVID-19 admissions versus non-COVID-19 admissions. The index NEWS2 was not proven to be better than the index NEWS. For each value of the index NEWS/NEWS2, COVID-19 admissions had a substantially higher risk of mortality than non-COVID-19 admissions which reflects the increased baseline mortality risk of COVID-19.","Richardson, Donald; Faisal, Muhammad; Fiori, Massimo; Beatson, Kevin; Mohammed, Mohammed",BMJ Open,292,1

We hypothesize that this targeted training will enhance the research environment at MSI's, increase the diversity of NIH-funded investigators and improve the training of underrepresented students in biomedical research, thus providing a feed-forward mechanism to expand the diversity of the US biomedical workforce in future years. A hallmark of IMERS is to engage participants in hands-on, active-learning style grant-writing training for faculty who are poised to submit NIH proposals ranging from development/exploratory to R01s. This training is provided by UK faculty and experienced research development professionals. The IMERS model incorporates guided writing, participatory training, and active learning. Training is comprised of several modalities. First, IMERS offers two 3-day grant-writing retreats/year on the UK campus. These workshops are designed for highly motivated investigators who have submitted proposals to NIH without success and those who have been actively planning NIH submission;~25 faculty are selected for each workshop via an on-line application. On-site workshops include consultation with actively funded UK investigators and staff from the UK Proposal Development Office;we strive to maintain post-workshop interactions between participants and UK faculty/staff. Three 2-day off-site workshops/year are also offered. The IMERS staff will work with off-site institutions to tailor the workshops to specific needs. In-person workshops have been postponed due to COVID-19 restrictions, but will resume when safe to do so. However, we have developed an active series of virtual workshops and seminars during this time, and we anticipate that these and additional on-line activities will continue as a third arm of training even after restriction are lifted. Travel and lodging expenses for faculty to attend UK workshops, for the IMERS team to travel, are covered by the grant. Workshop sessions cover numerous topics, including: using NIH resources for program/funding information, budget issues, the proposal review process, writing a high-impact specific aims page and an effective research strategy, rigor and reproducibility, responsible conduct of research, NIH Biosketch, navigating the NIH resubmission process, and mentoring student researchers. Program evaluation, based in part on participant survey data, communication email and an active ListServ and subsequent submission rate and success, validates that program participants have increased confidence in their grant-writing abilities and are succeeding in obtaining NIH funding.","Nickell, Melissa Spear Brett Frazier Donald",The FASEB Journal,292,1

The Italian Society of Gynecology and Obstetrics (SIGO), and the Multicenter Italian Trials in Ovarian cancer and gynecologic malignancies (MITO) promoted a national survey aiming to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on clinical activity of gynecologist oncologists and to assess the implementation of containment measures against COVID-19 diffusion. METHODS: The survey consisted of a self-administered, anonymous, online questionnaire. The survey was sent via email to all the members of the SIGO, and MITO groups on April 7, 2020, and was closed on April 20, 2020. RESULTS: Overall, 604 participants completed the questionnaire with a response-rate of 70%. The results of this survey suggest that gynecologic oncology units had set a proactive approach to COVID-19 outbreak. Triage methods were adopted in order to minimize in-hospital diffusion of COVID-19. Only 38% of gynecologic surgeons were concerned about COVID-19 outbreak. Although 73% of the participants stated that COVID-19 has not significantly modified their everyday practice, 21% declared a decrease of the use of laparoscopy in favor of open surgery (19%). However, less than 50% of surgeons adopted specific protection against COVID-19. Additionally, responders suggested to delay cancer treatment (10%-15%), and to perform less radical surgical procedures (20%-25%) during COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: National guidelines should be implemented to further promote the safety of patients and health care providers. International cooperation is of paramount importance, as heavily affected nations can serve as an example to find out ways to safely preserve clinical activity during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Bogani, Giorgio; Apolone, Giovanni; Ditto, Antonino; Scambia, Giovanni; Panici, Pierluigi Benedetti; Angioli, Roberto; Pignata, Sandro; Greggi, Stefano; Scollo, Paolo; Delia, Mezzanzanica; Franchi, Massimo; Martinelli, Fabio; Signorelli, Mauro; Lopez, Salvatore; Di Donato, Violante; Valabrega, Giorgio; Ferrandina, Gabriella; Palaia, Innocenza; Bergamini, Alice; Bocciolone, Luca; Savarese, Antonella; Ghezzi, Fabio; Casarin, Jvan; Pinelli, Ciro; Trojano, Vito; Chiantera, Vito; Giorda, Giorgio; Sopracordevole, Francesco; Malzoni, Mario; Salerno, Giovanna; Sartori, Enrico; Testa, Antonia; Zannoni, Gianfranco; Zullo, Fulvio; Vizza, Enrico; Trojano, Giuseppe; Chiantera, Antonio; Raspagliesi, Francesco",J Gynecol Oncol,292,1

Aims and Objective: We aimed to detect potential associations between medications taken regularly for comorbid diseases before the diagnosis of Covid-19 pneumonia and demographic or clinical features on admission. Materials and Methods: Patients diagnosed with pneumonia between March 11th, 2020 and April 15th, 2020 in emergency, internal medicine and cardiology outpatient clinics were recruited and their clinical and demographic features including blood tests, oxygen saturations (SO2) along with degree of lung infiltrations in computed tomography on admission were analyzed in regard to their medications used regularly. Results: Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inh.) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) users were older than no-ACE inh./ARB group and had significantly lower SO2 on admission, whereas NSAID users with Covid-19 displayed a marked female predominance and lower hemoglobin levels than no-NSAID group. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) users had also a significant female predominance and older age with lower hemoglobin levels. Lastly, antiaggregant users with Covid-19 had a lower SO2 on admission and overall, cases with regular drug intake were markedly associated with older age. Conclusion: Noteworthy associations were observed between demographic and clinical features on admission for Covid-19 pneumonia and major drug groups used regularly including RAAS inhibitors, NSAIDs and proton pump inhibitors.

METHODS: Ten senior medical students at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania were enrolled. Students were administered a precourse test on their perceived confidence of their urologic knowledge, confidence in identifying urologic conditions, comfort with performing urologic evaluations, and confidence placing consults for urologic issues. Students participated in a 2-week curriculum that included both asynchronous and synchronous content. Asynchronous content included prerecorded lectures, self-paced problem-based learning modules, directed reading and video content, and an online discussion board. Synchronous content included real-time videoconferences covering case discussions, simulated patient presentations, and critical literature reviews. At the conclusion of the course, students were administered the postcourse survey evaluating changes in their ability to identify and understand urologic conditions. RESULTS: The postcourse survey demonstrated this course significantly increases students' scores in: self-perceived urologic knowledge, confidence in naming urologic conditions, comfort with performing urologic evaluations, and confidence placing consults for urologic conditions (P <.05). CONCLUSION: Virtual medical student rotations are scalable and effective at delivering surgical material and can approximate the interpersonal teaching found in clinical learning environments. They may be a useful tool to supplement or augment clinical learning in select situations.","Williams, Cheyenne; Familusi, Olivia O; Ziemba, Justin; Lee, Daniel; Mittal, Sameer; Mucksavage, Phillip; Smith, Ariana; Kovell, Robert Caleb",Urology,292,16

METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of monthly operative case volumes and types for 8 residency programs for 2019 and January through April 2020. Cases were grouped as elective cranial, elective spine, and nonelective emergent cases. Programs were surveyed regarding residents' perceptions of the impact of COVID-19 on surgical training, didactics, and research participation. Data were analyzed for individual programs and pooled across programs. RESULTS: Across programs, the 2019 monthly mean ± SD case volume was 211 ± 82; 2020 mean ± SD case volumes for January, February, March, and April were 228 ± 93, 214 ± 84, 180 ± 73, and 107 ± 45. Compared with 2019, March and April 2020 mean cases declined 15% (P = 0.003) and 49% (P = 0.002), respectively. COVID-19 affected surgical case volume for all programs; 75% reported didactics negatively affected, and 90% reported COVID-19 resulted in increased research time. Several neurosurgery residents required COVID-19 testing; however, to our knowledge, only 1 resident from the participating programs tested positive. CONCLUSIONS: This study documents a significant reduction in operative volume in 8 neurosurgery residency training programs in early 2020. During this time, neurosurgery residents engaged in online didactics and research-related activities, reporting increased research productivity. Residency programs should collect data to determine the educational impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on residents' operative case volumes, identify deficiencies, and develop plans to mitigate any effects.","Aljuboori, Zaid S; Young, Christopher C; Srinivasan, Visish M; Kellogg, Ryan T; Quon, Jennifer L; Alshareef, Mohammed A; Chen, Stephanie H; Ivan, Michael; Grant, Gerald A; McEvoy, Sean D; Davanzo, Justin R; Majid, Sonia; Durfy, Sharon; Levitt, Michael R; Sieg, Emily P; Ellenbogen, Richard G; Nauta, Haring J",World Neurosurg,292,6

We evaluated characteristics associated with obtaining a COVID-19 test from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and receiving a positive test result for COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of 6 292 800 veterans in VHA care at 130 VHA medical facilities. We assessed the number of tests for SARS-CoV-2 administered by the VHA (n = 822 934) and the number of positive test results (n = 82 094) from February 8 through December 28, 2020. We evaluated associations of COVID-19 testing and test positivity with demographic characteristics of veterans, adjusting for facility characteristics, comorbidities, and county-level area-based socioeconomic measures using nested generalized linear models. RESULTS: In fully adjusted models, veterans who were female, Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, urban, and low income and had a disability had an increased likelihood of obtaining a COVID-19 test, and veterans who were Asian had a decreased likelihood of obtaining a COVID-19 test. Compared with veterans who were White, veterans who were Black/African American (risk ratio [RR] = 1.23; 95% CI, 1.19-1.27) and Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander (RR = 1.13; 95% CI, 1.05-1.21) had an increased likelihood of receiving a positive test result. Hispanic/Latino veterans had a 43% higher likelihood of receiving a positive test result than non-Hispanic/Latino veterans did. CONCLUSIONS: Although veterans have access to subsidized health care at the VHA, the increased risk of receiving a positive test result for COVID-19 among Black and Hispanic/Latino veterans, despite receiving more tests than White and non-Hispanic/Latino veterans, suggests that other factors (eg, social inequities) are driving disparities in COVID-19 prevalence.","Ferguson, Jacqueline M; Abdel Magid, Hoda S; Purnell, Amanda L; Kiang, Mathew V; Osborne, Thomas F",Public Health Rep,292,15

This review summarizes age-, sex-, and type-specific malignant cancer risks for PHTS patients, which is urgently needed for clinical management. A PubMed literature search for Standardized Incidence Ratios or Cumulative Lifetime cancer risks (CLTRs) resulted in nine cohort studies comprising four independent PHTS cohorts, including mainly index cases and prevalent cancer cases. The median age at diagnosis was 36 years. Reported CLTRs for any cancer varied from 81% to 90%. The tumor spectrum included female breast cancer (CLTRs including sex-specific estimates at age 60-70: 67% to 85%), endometrium cancer (19% to 28%), thyroid cancer (6% to 38%), renal cancer (2% to 24%), colorectal cancer (9% to 32%), and melanoma (0% to 6%). Although these estimates provide guidance for clinical care, discrepancies between studies, sample sizes, retrospective designs, strongly ascertained cases, and lack of pediatric research emphasizes that data should be interpreted with great caution. Therefore, more accurate and more personalized age-, sex-, and cancer-specific risk estimates are needed to enable counseling of all PHTS patients irrespective of ascertainment, and improvement of cancer surveillance guidelines.","Hendricks, Linda A J; Hoogerbrugge, Nicoline; Schuurs-Hoeijmakers, Janneke H M; Vos, Janet R",Clin. genet,292,16

Furthermore, VAL and TIA are also employed as feed additives to promote animal growth. However, the illegal use of VAL and TIA could cause a series of hazards to consumers. Here, VAL was designed to be conjugated with bovine serum protein to prepare immunogen. A highly sensitive monoclonal antibody that recognized both VAL and TIA has been successfully produced. Moreover, an immunochromatographic strip assay for rapidly screening VAL and TIA in porcine liver was established with visual detection limits (cutoff values) of 50 and 25 ng/g, respectively. The IC50 values calculated from the equation of the standard curve were 6.06 and 3.45 ng/g and the limits of detection were 0.96 and 0.29 ng/g for VAL and TIA. According to the recovery experiment results, the test strip exhibited acceptable accuracy and precision. Generally, the proposed strip provided a practical tool for the detection of VAL and TIA. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: We produced a highly sensitive monoclonal antibody and developed an immunoassay strip for simultaneously monitoring TIA and VAL. Additionally it was preliminarily confirmed that the rapid detection tool was suitable for screening TIA and VAL in porcine liver.","Na, Guanqiong; Hu, Xiaofei; Sun, Yaning; Kwee, Sharon; Xing, Guangxu; Xing, Yunrui; Zhang, Gaiping",J. food sci,292,16

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of US national database. SETTING: American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) from 2005 to 2017. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A recently published study that used the NSQIP database to compare outcomes after head and neck free tissue transfer between plastic surgeons and otolaryngologists was reproduced. Different approaches to case selection and statistical analysis were evaluated and their effects on statistical significance and study conclusions were compared. RESULTS: When all cases of free tissue transfer, captured in NSQIP between 2005 and 2017, were compared between plastic surgery and otolaryngology, plastic surgery patients appeared to have lower rates of complications and length of stay. However, a more in-depth analysis demonstrated that these results were confounded by older and sicker otolaryngology patients. A second analysis of the same NSQIP data, limited to only head and neck oncologic reconstructions, demonstrated that otolaryngology patients had fewer complications on univariate and multivariable analysis. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated how case selection and analysis can significantly affect results. It is incumbent upon researchers who use NSQIP and other publicly available data sets to fully detail their methodology to allow other researchers to reproduce and evaluate their work and for the journal editorial process to carefully evaluate the methodology and conclusions of their contributing authors.","Bur, Andrés M; Villwock, Mark R; Nallani, Rohit; Gomez, Ernest D; Varvares, Mark A; Villwock, Jennifer A; Cannady, Steven B; Wax, Mark K",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,292,30

In the present work, we report for the first time the construction of an immunosensor using a commercial 3D conductive filament of carbon black and polylactic acid (PLA) to detect Hantavirus Araucaria nucleoprotein (Np) as a proof-of-concept. The recognition biomolecule was anchored directly at the filament surface by using N-(3-Dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride and N-Hydroxysuccinimide (EDC/NHS). Conductive and non-conductive composites of PLA were characterized using thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), revealing around 30% w/w of carbon in the filament. Morphological features of composites were obtained from SEM and TEM measurements. FTIR measurement revealed that crosslinking agents were covalently bonded at the filament surface. Electrochemical techniques such as cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used for the evaluation of each step involved in the construction of the proposed immunosensor. The results showed the potentiality of the device for the quantitative detection of Hantavirus Araucaria nucleoprotein (Np) from 30 µg mL-1 to 240 µg mL-1 with a limit of detection of 22 µg mL-1. Also, the proposed immunosensor was applied with success for virus detection in 100x diluted human serum samples. Therefore, the PLA conductive filament with carbon black is a simple and excellent platform for immunosensing, which offers naturally carboxylic groups able to anchor covalently biomolecules.","Martins, Gustavo; Gogola, Jeferson L; Budni, Lucas H; Janegitz, Bruno C; Marcolino-Junior, Luiz H; Bergamini, Márcio F",Anal Chim Acta,292,30

Recent evidence suggests that this will cause additional maternal and childhood mortality and morbidity especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Here we have explored the contextual factors influencing maternal, neonatal and children health (MNCH) care in Bangladesh, Nigeria and South Africa amidst the pandemic. Our findings suggest that between March and May 2020, there was a reduction in utilisation of basic essential MNCH services such as antenatal care, family planning and immunization due to: a) the implementation of lockdown which triggered fear of contracting the COVID-19 and deterred people from accessing basic MNCH care, and b) a shift of focus towards pandemic, causing the detriment to other health services, and c) resource constraints. Taken together these issues have resulted in compromised provision of basic general healthcare. Given the likelihood of recurrent waves of the pandemic globally, COVID-19 mitigation plans therefore should be integrated with standard care provision to enhance system resilience to cope with all health needs. This commentary suggests a four-point contextualised mitigation plan to safeguard MNCH care during the pandemic using the observed countries as exemplars for LMIC health system adaptations to maintain the trajectory of progress regarding sustainable development goals (SDGs).","Ahmed, Tanvir; Rahman, Ahmed Ehsanur; Amole, Taiwo Gboluwaga; Galadanci, Hadiza; Matjila, Mushi; Soma-Pillay, Priya; Gillespie, Bronwen M; El Arifeen, Shams; Anumba, Dilly O C",Int J Equity Health,292,16

Complying with GMO requirements is complex, varies significantly across EU Member States and is leading to delays to clinical trials with ATMPs. Such delays and varying implementation of the GMO legislation makes the EU less attractive as a region to conduct clinical trials with investigational gene therapies. This is detrimental to EU patients, since their timely access to these transformative potentially curative medicines is delayed. Despite recent initiatives coordinated by the European Commission (EC) to facilitate and reduce discrepancies across the EU regarding the application of the GMO requirements, it remains particularly difficult to conduct multicenter clinical trials with ATMPs containing or consisting of GMOs involving several EU Member States. The recent decision for the EC to temporarily derogate potential coronavirus disease 2019 treatments and vaccines from some provisions of the GMO requirements was made on the basis of a clear recognition of such complexities and resulting delays to clinical development. The Alliance for Regenerative Medicine, the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations, and the European Association for Bioindustries call upon the EC, together with national competent authorities, to exempt ATMPs containing or consisting of GMOs from the GMO legislation. Such a simplification will eliminate the delays currently reported to occur when submitting environmental risk assessments and GMO applications to the national competent authorities. An exemption from GMO requirements will make the EU a more attractive region for clinical development of gene therapies and could accelerate European patients' access to these potentially life-saving medicines. Maintaining a system for GMO assessment that is different across countries may also prevent ATMPs from realizing the full benefits of a harmonized clinical trial approval process under the Clinical Trials Regulation. The undersigned organizations to this publication urge the EC to use its right of initiative to put forward a legislative proposal to exempt ATMPs in clinical development from the EU GMO legislation, within the timeframe proposed in the 2020 EU Pharmaceutical Strategy (by 2022). Implementation of a GMO exemption scheme before the end of the transition period for the Clinical Trial Regulation (the end of 2023) is important to avoid new Clinical Trial Application submissions for ATMPs under the Clinical Trial Regulation having to conduct the whole GMO assessment process in parallel. It is considered that ATMPs pose negligible risk to the environment. Such ATMPs include the following: human somatic cells modified ex vivo; recombinant virus-based vectors, including those containing genome editing nucleic acid sequences (which may also be delivered nonvirally); and bacterial vectors. Outside of controlled storage conditions, gene therapies cannot survive for any appreciable length of time. Upon clinical administration, any recombinant gene therapy viral vector particles that do not enter host cells are diluted within the body and if excreted are in such low multiplicity to no longer be viable or considered infectious to persons, animals, or living organisms within the environment. Any nucleic acids released into the environment are rapidly degraded.","Beattie, Stuart",Hum. gene ther,292,8

Even though SARS-CoV-2 is rarely detected in the central nervous system (CNS) or cerebrospinal fluid, evidence is accumulating that SARS-CoV-2 might enter the CNS via the olfactory nerve. However, what happens after SARS-CoV-2 enters the CNS is poorly understood. Therefore, we investigated the replication kinetics, cell tropism, and associated immune responses of SARS-CoV-2 infection in different types of neural cultures derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). SARS-CoV-2 was compared to the neurotropic and highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza A virus. SARS-CoV-2 infected a minority of individual mature neurons, without subsequent virus replication and spread, despite angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), and neuropilin-1 (NPR1) expression in all cultures. However, this sparse infection did result in the production of type III interferons and interleukin-8 (IL-8). In contrast, H5N1 virus replicated and spread very efficiently in all cell types in all cultures. Taken together, our findings support the hypothesis that neurological complications might result from local immune responses triggered by virus invasion, rather than abundant SARS-CoV-2 replication in the CNS. IMPORTANCE Infections with the recently emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are often associated with neurological complications. Evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 enters the brain via the olfactory nerve; however, SARS-CoV-2 is only rarely detected in the central nervous system of COVID-19 patients. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to infect neurons of human iPSC neural cultures but that this infection is abortive and does not result in virus spread to other cells. However, infection of neural cultures did result in the production of type III interferon and IL-8. This study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 might enter the CNS and infect individual neurons, triggering local immune responses that could contribute to the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2-associated CNS disease.","Bauer, Lisa; Lendemeijer, Bas; Leijten, Lonneke; Embregts, Carmen W E; Rockx, Barry; Kushner, Steven A; de Vrij, Femke M S; van Riel, Debby",mSphere,292,1

Various coronaviruses (CoV) such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), SARS-CoV-2 can infect human and the name was implicated due to their crown shape. SARS-CoV-2 is also called COVID-19 which was found to be a novel strain of coronavirus and is transmitted primarily through small droplets of viral particles that targets human body through the open pathways. Researchers have observed that microbes can survive for a longer duration they get adhered to any object or surface. Nanoparticles have giant capability to disable these pathogens even before they enter the body. To eradicate conventional time consuming steps like quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction for detection of COVID-19, nanoparticles mediated sensing approaches is providing a great advances in rapid diagnosis. Nano particles based biosensors are comparatively beneficial which offer tremendous potential for rapid medical diagnosis. Nanotechnology can be refined and optimized to attack a wide variety of pathogens. As compared to other large molecular structures, nanoparticles being small in size have huge sensitivity for bio-sensing and can move throughout the body without providing any disruption in the immune functioning.","Chauhan, Pallavi Singh; Yadav, Dhananjay; Dubey, Anuj; Jin, Jun-O",Curr. pharm. des,292,1

Despite national support for expanding the role of physician assistants (PAs) and NPs in serving patients with opioid use disorder, these clinicians are held to complex and stringent regulatory barriers. COVID-19 triggered significant changes from regulatory and federal agencies, yet disparate policies and regulations persist between physicians and PAs and NPs. The dual epidemics of COVID-19 and opioid use disorder highlight the inadequate infrastructure required to support patients, communities, and clinicians, and may serve as the catalyst for eliminating barriers to care.","Mitchell, Michaela; Shee, Kameron; Champlin, Kelly; Essary, Alison C; Evans, Matthew",JAAPA,292,22

This has led to the development of Bioinformatics. In this exploratory work, a novel mathematical method is applied to probe the DNA structure of two related viral families: those of coronaviruses and those of influenza viruses. The coronaviruses are SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, and MERS. The influenza viruses include H1N1-1918, H1N1-2009, H2N2-1957, and H3N2-1968. METHODS: The mathematical method used is the slow feature analysis (SFA), a rather new but promising method to delineate complex structure in DNA sequences. RESULTS: The analysis indicates that the DNA sequences exhibit an elaborate and convoluted structure akin to complex networks. We define a measure of complexity and show that each DNA sequence exhibits a certain degree of complexity within itself, while at the same time there exists complex inter-relationships between the sequences within a family and between the two families. From these relationships, we find evidence, especially for the coronavirus family, that increasing complexity in a sequence is associated with higher transmission rate but with lower mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The complexity measure defined here may hold a promise and could become a useful tool in the prediction of transmission and mortality rates in future new viral strains.","Tsonis, Anastasios A; Wang, Geli; Zhang, Lvyi; Lu, Wenxu; Kayafas, Aristotle; Del Rio-Tsonis, Katia",Hum Genomics,292,16

The objective of this investigation was to quantify airborne aerosol production under clinical and surgical conditions and examine efficacy of mask mitigation strategies. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective quantification of airborne aerosol generation during surgical and clinical simulation. SETTING: Cadaver laboratory and clinical examination room. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Airborne aerosol quantification with an optical particle sizer was performed in real time during cadaveric simulated endoscopic surgical conditions, including hand instrumentation, microdebrider use, high-speed drilling, and cautery. Aerosol sampling was additionally performed in simulated clinical and diagnostic settings. All clinical and surgical procedures were evaluated for propensity for significant airborne aerosol generation. RESULTS: Hand instrumentation and microdebridement did not produce detectable airborne aerosols in the range of 1 to 10 µm. Suction drilling at 12,000 rpm, high-speed drilling (4-mm diamond or cutting burs) at 70,000 rpm, and transnasal cautery generated significant airborne aerosols (P < .001). In clinical simulations, nasal endoscopy (P < .05), speech (P < .01), and sneezing (P < .01) generated 1- to 10-µm airborne aerosols. Significant aerosol escape was seen even with utilization of a standard surgical mask (P < .05). Intact and VENT-modified (valved endoscopy of the nose and throat) N95 respirator use prevented significant airborne aerosol spread. CONCLUSION: Transnasal drill and cautery use is associated with significant airborne particulate matter production in the range of 1 to 10 µm under surgical conditions. During simulated clinical activity, airborne aerosol generation was seen during nasal endoscopy, speech, and sneezing. Intact or VENT-modified N95 respirators mitigated airborne aerosol transmission, while standard surgical masks did not.","Workman, Alan D; Jafari, Aria; Welling, D Bradley; Varvares, Mark A; Gray, Stacey T; Holbrook, Eric H; Scangas, George A; Xiao, Roy; Carter, Bob S; Curry, William T; Bleier, Benjamin S",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,292,5

However, concerns about the risk of expedited science have been raised. We aimed at reviewing and categorizing COVID-19-related medical research and to critically appraise peer-reviewed original articles. METHODS: The data sources were Pubmed, Cochrane COVID-19 register study, arXiv, medRxiv and bioRxiv, from 01/11/2019 to 01/05/2020. Peer-reviewed and preprints publications related to COVID-19 were included, written in English or Chinese. No limitations were placed on study design. Reviewers screened and categorized studies according to i) publication type, ii) country of publication, and iii) topics covered. Original articles were critically appraised using validated quality assessment tools. RESULTS: Among the 11,452 publications identified, 10,516 met the inclusion criteria, among which 7468 (71.0%) were peer-reviewed articles. Among these, 4190 publications (56.1%) did not include any data or analytics (comprising expert opinion pieces). Overall, the most represented topics were infectious disease (n = 2326, 22.1%), epidemiology (n = 1802, 17.1%), and global health (n = 1602, 15.2%). The top five publishing countries were China (25.8%), United States (22.3%), United Kingdom (8.8%), Italy (8.1%) and India (3.4%). The dynamic of publication showed that the exponential growth of COVID-19 peer-reviewed articles was mainly driven by publications without original data (mean 261.5 articles ± 51.1 per week) as compared with original articles (mean of 69.3 ± 22.3 articles per week). Original articles including patient data accounted for 713 (9.5%) of peer-reviewed studies. A total of 576 original articles (80.8%) showed intermediate to high risk of bias. Last, except for simulation studies that mainly used large-scale open data, the median number of patients enrolled was of 102 (IQR = 37-337). CONCLUSIONS: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority of research is composed by publications without original data. Peer-reviewed original articles with data showed a high risk of bias and included a limited number of patients. Together, these findings underscore the urgent need to strike a balance between the velocity and quality of research, and to cautiously consider medical information and clinical applicability in a pressing, pandemic context.

To curb the spread of the disease in mid-March, different states issued mandatory stay-at-home (SAH) orders. These nonpharmaceutical interventions were mandated based on prior experiences, such as the 1918 influenza epidemic. Hence, we decided to study the impact of restrictions on mobility on reducing COVID-19 transmission. Methods: We designed an ecological time series study with our exposure variable as Mobility patterns in the state of Maryland for March- December 2020 and our outcome variable as the COVID-19 hospitalizations for the same period. We built an Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) ensemble machine learning model and regressed the lagged COVID-19 hospitalizations with Mobility volume for different regions of Maryland. Results: We found an 18% increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations when mobility was increased by a factor of five, similarly a 43% increase when mobility was further increased by a factor of ten. Conclusion: The findings of our study demonstrated a positive linear relationship between mobility and the incidence of COVID-19 cases. These findings are partially consistent with other studies suggesting the benefits of mobility restrictions. Although more detailed approach is needed to precisely understand the benefits and limitations of mobility restrictions as part of a response to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Raghuraman, Nandini; Kaushik, Kartik; Niemeier, Deb",,292,5

The purpose of this study is to identify the incidence of VTE and mortality in COVID-19 patients initially presenting to a large health system. Our retrospective study included adult patients (excluding patients presenting with obstetric/gynecologic conditions) across a multihospital health system in the New York Metropolitan Region from March 1-April 27, 2020. VTE and mortality rates within 8 h of assessment were described. In 10,871 adults with COVID-19, 118 patients (1.09%) were diagnosed with symptomatic VTE (101 pulmonary embolism, 17 deep vein thrombosis events) and 28 patients (0.26%) died during initial assessment. Among these 146 patients, 64.4% were males, 56.8% were 60 years or older, 15.1% had a BMI > 35, and 11.6% were admitted to the intensive care unit. Comorbidities included hypertension (46.6%), diabetes (24.7%), hyperlipidemia (14.4%), chronic lung disease (12.3%), coronary artery disease (11.0%), and prior VTE (7.5%). Key medications included corticosteroids (22.6%), statins (21.2%), antiplatelets (20.6%), and anticoagulants (20.6%). Highest D-Dimer was greater than six times the upper limit of normal in 51.4%. Statin and antiplatelet use were associated with decreased VTE or mortality (each p < 0.01). In COVID-19 patients who initially presented to a large multihospital health system, the overall symptomatic VTE and mortality rate was over 1.0%.

Single symptoms account for a substantial volume of testing and disruption to in-person learning and childcare, yet their predictive value is unclear, given the clinical overlap with other circulating respiratory viruses and non-infectious etiologies. We aimed to determine the relative frequency and predictive value of single symptoms for paediatric SARS-CoV-2 infections from an Ottawa COVID-19 assessment centre from October 2020 through April 2021. Overall, 46.3% (n=10,688) of pediatric encounters were for single symptoms, and 2.7% of these tested positive. The most common presenting single symptoms were rhinorrhea (31.8%), cough (17.4%) and fever (14.0%). Among children with high-risk exposures children in each age group, the following single symptoms had a higher proportion of positive SARS-CoV-2 cases compared to no symptoms; fever and fatigue (0-4 years); fever, cough, headache, and rhinorrhea (5-12 years); fever, loss of taste or smell, headache, rhinorrhea, sore throat, and cough (13-17 years). There was no evidence that the single symptom of either rhinorrhea or cough predicted SARS-CoV-2 infections among 0-4 year olds, despite accounting for a large volume (61.1%) of single symptom presentations in the absence of high-risk exposures. Symptom-based screening needs to be responsive to changes in evidence and local factors, including the expected resurgence of other respiratory viruses following relaxation of social distancing/masking, to reduce infection-related risks in schools and daycare settings.","Webster, Richard J; Reddy, Deepti; Harrison, Mary-Ann; Farion, Ken J; Willmore, Jacqueline; Foote, Michelle; Thampi, Nisha",,292,15

In conclusion, it was clearly identified that, in general, the products exported as mostly canned, frozen, and smoked fish have experienced an increase in demand. However, these increases have not been compensated for the decreases in demand for other products, yet. In that chaotic situation, therefore, the Turkish government should immediately fund the fisheries and aquaculture sectors. In the context of risk management, the government also should make new arrangements and promotions for processing industries (enhancing the capacity both in volume and in product variety) to protect and improve fishing and aquaculture sectors in the mid and long term.","Can, M.

Cape Town has many vulnerable communities because of poverty, overcrowding and comorbidities, although it has a relatively small elderly population. Amongst the unique and early responses to the pandemic in South Africa has been the strategy of community screening and testing (CST). This process has been drawn from health department's prior adoption of a community-orientated primary care (COPC) approach, which relies on teams of community health workers working in delineated communities to prevent disease and provide early interventions for those at higher risk. The COPC principles were applied in the CST programme, which involved collaboration between facility and community-based teams, linking public health and primary care approaches, careful mapping of cases in highly vulnerable communities, targeted screening around cases, testing of those that screened positive, health education and linkage to primary care. The overall aim was to slow down transmission through early identification and isolation of diagnosed cases. Key challenges involved the designing of a screening tool with appropriate sensitivity and specificity as well as the logistics of staffing, transport, consumables, data collection and capture, security, ablutions and personal protective equipment. Key opportunities included synergies between CST and evolving commitment to COPC in the health system. Key threats were the deteriorating security situation in the most vulnerable communities because of loss of income, food insecurity and CST distrust as well as increasing turn-around-times for test results.","David, Neal; Mash, Robert",Afr J Prim Health Care Fam Med,292,5

We assessed the impact of environmental factors (temperature, humidity and air pollution) on the global patterns of COVID-19 early outbreak dynamics during January-May 2020, controlling for several key socio-economic factors and airport connections. We showed that during the earliest phase of the global outbreak (January-March), COVID-19 growth rates were non-linearly related to climate, with fastest spread in regions with a mean temperature of ca. 5 °C, and in the most polluted regions. However, environmental effects faded almost completely when considering later outbreaks, in keeping with the progressive enforcement of containment actions. Accordingly, COVID-19 growth rates consistently decreased with stringent containment actions during both early and late outbreaks. Our findings indicate that environmental drivers may have played a role in explaining the early variation among regions in disease spread. With limited policy interventions, seasonal patterns of disease spread might emerge, with temperate regions of both hemispheres being most at risk of severe outbreaks during colder months. Nevertheless, containment measures play a much stronger role and overwhelm impacts of environmental variation, highlighting the key role for policy interventions in curbing COVID-19 diffusion within a given region. If the disease will become seasonal in the next years, information on environmental drivers of COVID-19 can be integrated with epidemiological models to inform forecasting of future outbreak risks and improve management plans.","Ficetola, Gentile Francesco; Rubolini, Diego",Sci Total Environ,292,24

The structure of the obtained compounds was confirmed using 1H and 13C NMR, FT-IR spectroscopy and elemental analysis and COSY and HMQC for the representative molecules. The photophysical (UV-Vis, PL) and biological properties of all of the prepared compounds were studied. It was found that the amine with the n-hexyl group in EtOH had the highest PL quantum yield (Ð¤ = 85%) compared to the others. Moreover, the chelating properties of the azomethines with the n-hexyl group (1a, 1b, 1c) were tested against various cations (Al3+, Ba2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Cr3+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Mn2+, Ni2+, Pb2+, Sr2+ and Zn2+) in an acetonitrile, acetone and PBS/AC mixture. Compounds that contained the electron withdrawing groups (-Br, -I) had the ability to chelate most of the studied cations, while the unsubstituted derivative chelated only the trivalent cations such as Al3+, Cr3+ and Fe3+ in acetonitrile. The effect of the environment on the keto-enol tautomeric equilibrium was also demonstrated, especially in the case of the derivative with a bromine atom. The biological studies showed that the tested molecules had no cytotoxicity. Additionally, the ability to image intracellular organelles such as the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum was revealed. The crucial role of the hydrolysis of imines for cellular imaging was presented.","Korzec, Mateusz; Malarz, Katarzyna; Mrozek-Wilczkiewicz, Anna; Rzycka-Korzec, Roksana; Schab-Balcerzak, Ewa; Polanski, Jaroslaw",Spectrochim Acta A Mol Biomol Spectrosc,292,16

Emerging evidence suggests that there might be an association between COVID‐19 and GBS. Nevertheless, the underlying pathophysiological mechanism remains unclear.Materials and MethodsWe performed bioinformatic analyses to delineate the potential genetic crosstalk between COVID‐19 and GBS.ResultsCOVID‐19 and GBS were associated with a similar subset of immune/inflammation regulatory genes, including TNF, CSF2, IL2RA, IL1B, IL4, IL6 and IL10. Protein‐protein interaction network analysis revealed that the combined gene set showed an increased connectivity as compared to COVID‐19 or GBS alone, particularly the potentiated interactions with CD86, IL23A, IL27, ISG20, PTGS2, HLA‐DRB1, HLA‐DQB1 and ITGAM, and these genes are related to Th17 cell differentiation. Transcriptome analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with COVID‐19 and GBS further demonstrated the activation of interleukin‐17 signalling in both conditions.ConclusionsAugmented Th17 cell differentiation and cytokine response was identified in both COVID‐19 and GBS. PBMC transcriptome analysis also suggested the pivotal involvement of Th17 signalling pathway. In conclusion, our data suggested aberrant Th17 cell differentiation as a possible mechanism by which COVID‐19 can increase the risk of GBS.","Li, Zheng Huang Ziheng Li Xingye Huang Cheng Shen Jianxiong Li Shugang Zhang Lin Wong Sunny H.; Chan, Matthew T.

UVC light has been suggested as a potential option for decontamination of FFRs by the Centers for Disease Control. There has been a lack of publications characterizing UVC dose distribution across FFRs. Methods: A UVC light box and FFR rack system was assembled utilizing low pressure mercury lamps peaked at 254 nm and aluminum flashing to reduce shadowing effect. Dose was characterized with the use of UV intensity labels and a UVGI (ultraviolet germicidal irradiation) NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) traceable meter. Ozone production was evaluated after extended bulb run time. Results: Calibration of UV intensity labels were noted to have color-change saturation at 100 mJ/cm 2. Dose measurements with the UV intensity labels on the FFR demonstrated symmetric dose to all surfaces but symmetry not supported by measurements with the UVGI meter. There was substantial dose fall off on the lateral aspects of the FFR. No ozone production was noted in the UVC system. Conclusions: UV intensity labels for characterization of dose provided a false suggestion of symmetry when compared to UVGI meter. Estimates of appropriate exposure times to reach 1000 mJ/cm2 should be significantly increased to account for geometry of FFR and lateral dose fall off.,"Dunn, Emily F; Akhtar, Adil; Dunn, Adam; Lacey, Scott; Pauley, Ethan; Powers, Colton; McKee, James; Petereit, Daniel",Adv Radiat Oncol,292,16

However, performance data are lacking, especially in asymptomatic people. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing when used for facility-wide testing during a nursing home outbreak. DESIGN: A prospective evaluation involving 3 facility-wide rounds of testing where paired respiratory specimens were collected to evaluate the performance of the BinaxNOW antigen test compared with virus culture and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Early and late infection were defined using changes in RT-PCR cycle threshold values and prior test results. SETTING: A nursing home with an ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. PARTICIPANTS: 532 paired specimens collected from 234 available residents and staff. MEASUREMENTS: Percentage of positive agreement (PPA) and percentage of negative agreement (PNA) for BinaxNOW compared with RT-PCR and virus culture. RESULTS: BinaxNOW PPA with virus culture, used for detection of replication-competent virus, was 95%. However, the overall PPA of antigen testing with RT-PCR was 69%, and PNA was 98%. When only the first positive test result was analyzed for each participant, PPA of antigen testing with RT-PCR was 82% among 45 symptomatic people and 52% among 343 asymptomatic people. Compared with RT-PCR and virus culture, the BinaxNOW test performed well in early infection (86% and 95%, respectively) and poorly in late infection (51% and no recovered virus, respectively). LIMITATION: Accurate symptom ascertainment was challenging in nursing home residents; test performance may not be representative of testing done by nonlaboratory staff. CONCLUSION: Despite lower positive agreement compared with RT-PCR, antigen test positivity had higher agreement with shedding of replication-competent virus. These results suggest that antigen testing could be a useful tool to rapidly identify contagious people at risk for transmitting SARS-CoV-2 during nascent outbreaks and help reduce COVID-19 burden in nursing homes.

Here we investigate the immune events from the acute state up to four weeks post SARS-CoV-2 infection, in non-human primates (NHP) with heterogeneous pulmonary pathology. We show a robust migration of CD16 expressing monocytes to the lungs occurring during the acute phase, and we describe two subsets of interstitial macrophages (HLA-DR+CD206-): a transitional CD11c+CD16+ cell population directly associated with IL-6 levels in plasma, and a long-lasting CD11b+CD16+ cell population. Trafficking of monocytes is mediated by TARC (CCL17) and associates with viral load measured in bronchial brushes. We also describe associations between disease outcomes and high levels of cell infiltration in lungs including CD11b+CD16hi macrophages and CD11b+ neutrophils. Accumulation of macrophages is long-lasting and detectable even in animals with mild or no signs of disease. Interestingly, animals with anti-inflammatory responses including high IL-10:IL-6 and kynurenine to tryptophan ratios show less severe illness.

This leaves the nucleosomal DNA with access restrictions, which impose a significant barrier to repair of damaged DNA. The efficiency of DNA repair has been related to nucleosome structure and chromatin status, which is modulated in part by post-translational modifications (PTMs) of histones. Numerous studies have suggested a role for acetylation of lysine at position 56 of the H3 histone (H3K56ac) in various DNA transactions, including the response to DNA damage and its association with human cancer. Biophysical studies have revealed that H3K56ac increases DNA accessibility by facilitating spontaneous and transient unwrapping motions of the DNA ends. However, how this acetylation mark modulates nucleosome structure and dynamics to promote accessibility to the damaged DNA for repair factors and other proteins is still poorly understood. Here, we utilize approximately 5-6 microseconds of atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to delineate the impact of H3K56 acetylation on the nucleosome structure and dynamics, and to elucidate how these nucleosome properties are further impacted when a bulky benzo[a]pyrene-derived DNA lesion is placed near the acetylation site. Our findings reveal that H3K56ac alone induces considerable disturbance to the histone-DNA/histone-histone interactions, and amplifies the distortions imposed by the presence of the lesion. Our work highlights the important role of H3K56 acetylation in response to DNA damage and depicts how access to DNA lesions by the repair machinery can be facilitated within the nucleosome via a key acetylation event.","Fu, Iwen; Geacintov, Nicholas E; Broyde, Suse",DNA Repair (Amst),292,16

Although SSEs appear to be difficult to predict and therefore difficult to prevent, core public health actions can prevent and reduce the number and impact of SSEs. To prevent and control of SSEs, speed is essential. Prevention and mitigation of SSEs depends, first and foremost, on quickly recognizing and understanding these events, particularly within healthcare settings.

Social media platforms have been recognized as important tools for health-promoting practices in public health, and the use of social media is widespread among the public. However, little is known about the effects of social media use on health promotion during a pandemic such as COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to explore the predictive role of social media use on public preventive behaviors in China during the COVID-19 pandemic and how disease knowledge and eHealth literacy moderated the relationship between social media use and preventive behaviors. METHODS: A national web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted by a proportionate probability sampling among 802 Chinese internet users (""netizens"") in February 2020. Descriptive statistics, Pearson correlations, and hierarchical multiple regressions were employed to examine and explore the relationships among all the variables. RESULTS: Almost half the 802 study participants were male (416, 51.9%), and the average age of the participants was 32.65 years. Most of the 802 participants had high education levels (624, 77.7%), had high income >¥5000 (US $736.29) (525, 65.3%), were married (496, 61.8%), and were in good health (486, 60.6%). The average time of social media use was approximately 2 to 3 hours per day (mean 2.34 hours, SD 1.11), and the most frequently used media types were public social media (mean score 4.49/5, SD 0.78) and aggregated social media (mean score 4.07/5, SD 1.07). Social media use frequency (ß=.20, P<.001) rather than time significantly predicted preventive behaviors for COVID-19. Respondents were also equipped with high levels of disease knowledge (mean score 8.15/10, SD 1.43) and eHealth literacy (mean score 3.79/5, SD 0.59). Disease knowledge (ß=.11, P=.001) and eHealth literacy (ß=.27, P<.001) were also significant predictors of preventive behaviors. Furthermore, eHealth literacy (P=.038) and disease knowledge (P=.03) positively moderated the relationship between social media use frequency and preventive behaviors, while eHealth literacy (ß=.07) affected this relationship positively and disease knowledge (ß=-.07) affected it negatively. Different social media types differed in predicting an individual's preventive behaviors for COVID-19. Aggregated social media (ß=.22, P<.001) was the best predictor, followed by public social media (ß=.14, P<.001) and professional social media (ß=.11, P=.002). However, official social media (ß=.02, P=.597) was an insignificant predictor. CONCLUSIONS: Social media is an effective tool to promote behaviors to prevent COVID-19 among the public. Health literacy is essential for promotion of individual health and influences the extent to which the public engages in preventive behaviors during a pandemic. Our results not only enrich the theoretical paradigm of public health management and health communication but also have practical implications in pandemic control for China and other countries.","Li, Xiaojing; Liu, Qinliang",J Med Internet Res,292,15

The Copenhagen EMS operates two telephone line the 1-1-2 emergency number and the 1813 medical helpline. A separate coronavirus support track was implemented on the 1813 medical helpline and a web-based self-triage (web triage) system was created to reduce non-emergency call volume. The aim of this paper is to present call volume and the two measures implemented to handle the increased call volume to the Copenhagen EMS. METHODS: This is a cross sectional observational study. Call volume and queue time is presented in the first month of the COVID-19 pandemic (27th of February 2020 to 27th of march) and compared to the equivalent month from the year before (2019). Descriptive statistics are conducted on call volumes and queue times and spearman's rank correlation test are performed to test correlation between web triage and call volume. RESULTS: Total EMS call volume increase by 23.3% between 2019 and 2020 (92.670 vs. 114,250). The 1-1-2 emergency line total call volume increase by 4.4% (8,4942 vs. 8,870) and the 1813 medical helpline increased by 25.1% (84.176 vs. 105.380). The coronavirus support track handled 21,063 calls. The 1813 medical helpline queue time was a mean of 02 minutes and 23 seconds (CI: 2.22-2.25) in 2019 and 12 minutes and 2 seconds (CI 11:55-12:09) in 2020 (P < 0.001). The web triage was used 10,894 times. No correlation between call volume and web triage usage was seen. CONCLUSIONS: In the first month of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic a significant increase in call volume was observed in the 1813 medical helpline compared to 2019. A large number of calls were handled by the additional coronavirus track and diverted away from the regular tracks of the 1813 medical helpline.

While originally considered to be a rather homogeneous cell type, recent attention to neutrophils has uncovered their fascinating transcriptional and functional diversity as well as their developmental trajectories. These new findings are important to better understand the many facets of neutrophil involvement not only in COVID-19 but also many other acute or chronic inflammatory diseases, both communicable and non-communicable. Here, we highlight the observed immune deviation of neutrophils in COVID-19 and summarize several promising therapeutic attempts to precisely target neutrophils and their reactivity in patients with COVID-19.","Reusch, Nico; De Domenico, Elena; Bonaguro, Lorenzo; Schulte-Schrepping, Jonas; Baßler, Kevin; Schultze, Joachim L; Aschenbrenner, Anna C",Front Immunol,292,16

We hypothesize a new mechanism supporting the synergistic interaction between these drugs. Azithromycin is a substrate of ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein) which is localized in endosomes and lysosomes with a polarized substrate transport from the cell cytosol into the vesicle interior. SARS-CoV-2 and drugs meet in these acidic organelles and both basic drugs, which are potent lysosomotropic compounds, will become protonated and trapped within these vesicles. Consequently, their intra-vesicular concentrations can attain low micromolar effective cytotoxic concentrations on SARS-CoV-2 while concomitantly increase the intra-vesicular pH up to around neutrality. This last effect inhibits lysosomal enzyme activities responsible in virus entry and replication cycle. Based on these considerations, we hypothesize that ABCB1 could be a possible enhancer by confining azithromycin more extensively than expected when the trapping is solely dependent on the passive diffusion. This additional mechanism may therefore explain the synergistic effect when azithromycin is added to hydroxychloroquine, leading to apparently more rapid virus clearance and better clinical benefit, when compared to monotherapy with hydroxychloroquine alone.","Scherrmann, J M",AAPS J,292,21

Some uses are more benign such as ecotourism (e.g., viewing elephants in natural settings), while others induce significant levels of suffering, pain and distress with the denial of dignity and respect (e.g., elephants performing at a circus). What is missing is a comprehensive overview of how just these uses may or may not be. Justice, as a concept, is complex and controversial—even more so when applied to animals. In this paper, we propose a “scales of justice” framework for animals used in tourism (deep, intermediate, shallow, and no justice) based on two different normative ethics models. The first model is based on the conventional normative ethical domain that includes deontology and consequentialism (i.e., what we are told to do), while the second model is rooted in virtue ethics (i.e., what we ought to do as individuals). The intent is to “weigh” the just and unjust use of animals in the tourism industry based on these contrasting theoretical perspectives. Elephants are used as an example through the paper. We view this approach as a springboard for more intensive investigations on how animals are used in tourism in a variety of contexts.","Fennell, David A.; Sheppard, Valerie",J.

Although alcohol use has increased in response to the pandemic, no known studies have identified transdiagnostic risk factors for greater drinking in response to COVID-related distress. Individuals with more difficulty with emotion regulation may drink more during the pandemic to manage pandemic-related distress. The current study tested whether difficulty with emotion regulation was related to greater estimated blood alcohol content (eBAC) during a typical week in the past month and if this was due to COVID-related distress and drinking to cope with the pandemic. The sample consisted of 347 past-month drinking undergraduates in Louisiana, a state with some of the U.S. highest rates of COVID-19 infections and related deaths. Difficulty with engaging in goal-directed behaviors was related to greater past-month eBAC and this relation was mediated by the sequential effects of COVID-related worry and drinking to cope with the pandemic. Results indicate that individuals with difficulty engaging in goal-directed behaviors are especially vulnerable to greater eBAC during the COVID-19 pandemic which may be due in part to their vulnerability to more COVID-related worry which may lead to more drinking to cope with the pandemic.","Buckner, Julia D; Lewis, Elizabeth M; Abarno, Cristina N; Morris, Paige E; Glover, Nina I; Zvolensky, Michael J",Cogn Behav Ther,292,20

It has also heavily burdened healthcare professionals and the virus poses serious risks for their personal and professional lives. Therefore, the present study examined the associations between fear of COVID-19 and workplace phobia among doctors in Pakistan during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An online survey was conducted among 421 doctors in Pakistan between April 10 and May 25, 2020. The Workplace Phobia Scale (WPS) and the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) were the main psychometric instruments used in this study. RESULTS: There was a significant positive relationship between fear of COVID-19 and workplace panic anxiety and workplace avoidance behavior. Significantly higher fear of COVID-19 was found among (i) females compared to males, (ii) doctors with 5 years or less of work experience compared to those with more than 5 years, and (iii) postgraduate trainees compared with other ranks. Two groups (doctors who were above 30 years old and postgraduate trainees) were found to have higher levels of workplace phobia compared to their counterparts. Doctors with severe levels of fear of COVID-19 had significantly higher levels of workplace panic anxiety and workplace avoidance behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Fear of COVID-19 was significantly associated with workplace phobia which may negatively affect doctors' performance. Therefore, important steps are needed to protect doctors' health by providing sufficient resources to allay their fears and anxieties which consequently help them in carrying out their frontline duties in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Malik, Sadia; Ullah, Irfan; Irfan, Muhammad; Ahorsu, Daniel Kwasi; Lin, Chung-Ying; Pakpour, Amir H; Griffiths, Mark D; Rehman, Ibad Ur; Minhas, Rafia",BMC Public Health,292,22

However, following a temporal delay infections started to expand to older age groups. A comprehensive understanding of such transmission dynamics will be key for managing the pandemic in the time to come and to anticipate future developments. The present study thus extends the scope of previous SARS-CoV-2-related research in Switzerland by contributing to deeper insight into the potential impact of &ldquo;social mixing&rdquo; of different age groups on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections. METHODS: The present study examined persons aged 65 years and older with respect to possible SARS-CoV-2 exposure risks using longitudinal panel data from the Swiss COVID-19 Social Monitor. The study used data from two assessments (survey &ldquo;May&rdquo; and survey &ldquo;August&rdquo;). Survey &ldquo;May&rdquo; took place shortly after the release of the lockdown in Switzerland. Survey &ldquo;August&rdquo; was conducted in mid-August. To identify at-risk elderly persons, we conducted a combined factor/k-means clustering analysis of the survey data assessed in August in order to examine different patterns of adherence to recommended preventive measures. RESULTS: In summary, 270 (survey &ldquo;May&rdquo;) and 256 (survey &ldquo;August&rdquo;) persons aged 65 years and older were analysed for the present study. Adherence to established preventive measures was similar across the two surveys, whereas adherence pertaining to social contacts decreased substantially from survey &ldquo;May&rdquo; to survey &ldquo;August&rdquo;. The combined factor/k-means clustering analysis to identify at-risk elderly individuals yielded four distinct groups with regard to different patterns of adherence to recommended preventive measures: a larger group of individuals with many social contacts but high self-reported adherence to preventive measures (n = 86); a small group with many social contacts and overall lower adherence (n = 26); a group with comparatively few contacts and few social activities (n = 66); and a group which differed from the latter through fewer contacts but more social activities (n = 78). Sociodemographic characteristics and risk perception with regard to SARS-CoV-2 infections among the four groups did not differ in a relevant way across the four groups. CONCLUSIONS: Although many elderly persons continued to follow the recommended preventive measures during the transitional phase between the two pandemic waves, social mixing with younger persons constitutes a way for transmission of infections across age groups. Pandemic containment among all age groups thus remains essential to protect vulnerable populations, including the elderly.","Haag, Christina; Höglinger, Marc; Moser, André; Hämmig, Oliver; Puhan, Milo; von Wyl, Viktor",Swiss Med Wkly,292,24

Results: A total of 214 patients were randomized, with a mean (SD) age of 45.2 (14.6) years and 132 (61.7%) women. The study was stopped for a low conditional power for benefit with no significant difference among the 4 groups for the primary end point. Patients who received usual care without supplementation achieved a 50% reduction in symptoms at a mean (SD) of 6.7 (4.4) days compared with 5.5 (3.7) days for the ascorbic acid group, 5.9 (4.9) days for the zinc gluconate group, and 5.5 (3.4) days for the group receiving both (overall P = .45). There was no significant difference in secondary outcomes among the treatment groups. Conclusions and Relevance: In this randomized clinical trial of ambulatory patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection, treatment with high-dose zinc gluconate, ascorbic acid, or a combination of the 2 supplements did not significantly decrease the duration of symptoms compared with standard of care.

Health care organizations have responded to the first phase of the pandemic by rapidly adopting digital solutions and advanced technology tools. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review is to describe the digital solutions that have been reported in the early scientific literature to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on individuals and health systems. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of early COVID-19-related literature (from January 1 to April 30, 2020) by searching MEDLINE and medRxiv with appropriate terms to find relevant literature on the use of digital technologies in response to the pandemic. We extracted study characteristics such as the paper title, journal, and publication date, and we categorized the retrieved papers by the type of technology and patient needs addressed. We built a scoring rubric by cross-classifying the patient needs with the type of technology. We also extracted information and classified each technology reported by the selected articles according to health care system target, grade of innovation, and scalability to other geographical areas. RESULTS: The search identified 269 articles, of which 124 full-text articles were assessed and included in the review after screening. Most of the selected articles addressed the use of digital technologies for diagnosis, surveillance, and prevention. We report that most of these digital solutions and innovative technologies have been proposed for the diagnosis of COVID-19. In particular, within the reviewed articles, we identified numerous suggestions on the use of artificial intelligence (AI)-powered tools for the diagnosis and screening of COVID-19. Digital technologies are also useful for prevention and surveillance measures, such as contact-tracing apps and monitoring of internet searches and social media usage. Fewer scientific contributions address the use of digital technologies for lifestyle empowerment or patient engagement. CONCLUSIONS: In the field of diagnosis, digital solutions that integrate with traditional methods, such as AI-based diagnostic algorithms based both on imaging and clinical data, appear to be promising. For surveillance, digital apps have already proven their effectiveness; however, problems related to privacy and usability remain. For other patient needs, several solutions have been proposed, such as telemedicine or telehealth tools. These tools have long been available, but this historical moment may actually be favoring their definitive large-scale adoption. It is worth taking advantage of the impetus provided by the crisis; it is also important to keep track of the digital solutions currently being proposed to implement best practices and models of care in future and to adopt at least some of the solutions proposed in the scientific literature, especially in national health systems, which have proved to be particularly resistant to the digital transition in recent years.","Golinelli, Davide; Boetto, Erik; Carullo, Gherardo; Nuzzolese, Andrea Giovanni; Landini, Maria Paola; Fantini, Maria Pia",J Med Internet Res,292,1

The primary objective of our study was to assess the performance of LUS in determining severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia compared with chest CT scan. Secondary objectives were to test the association between LUS score and location of the patient, use of mechanical ventilation, and the pulse oximetry (SpO2)/fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio. METHODS: A multicentre observational study was performed between 15 March and 20 April 2020. Patients in the Emergency Department (ED) or Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with acute dyspnoea who were PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2, and who had LUS and chest CT performed within a 24-h period, were included. RESULTS: One hundred patients were included. LUS score was significantly associated with pneumonia severity assessed by chest CT and clinical features. The AUC of the ROC curve of the relationship of LUS versus chest CT for the assessment of severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia was 0.78 (CI 95% 0.68-0.87; p < 0.0001). A high LUS score was associated with the use of mechanical ventilation, and with a SpO2/FiO2 ratio below 357. CONCLUSION: In known SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia patients, the LUS score was predictive of pneumonia severity as assessed by a chest CT scan and clinical features. Within the limitations inherent to our study design, LUS can be used to assess SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia severity.","Zieleskiewicz, Laurent; Markarian, Thibaut; Lopez, Alexandre; Taguet, Chloé; Mohammedi, Neyla; Boucekine, Mohamed; Baumstarck, Karine; Besch, Guillaume; Mathon, Gautier; Duclos, Gary; Bouvet, Lionel; Michelet, Pierre; Allaouchiche, Bernard; Chaumoître, Kathia; Di Bisceglie, Mathieu; Leone, Marc",Intensive Care Med,292,16

METHOD: We verified and applied a two-tiered testing strategy combining a SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific lateral flow assay (LFA) with a nucleocapsid protein (NCP) IgG ELISA to assess seroconversion in n = 7241 individuals. The majority had experienced symptoms consistent with COVID-19, but had no access to RT-PCR testing. Longitudinal follow-up in n = 97 LFA + individuals was performed up to 20 weeks after initial infection using NCP and spike protein S1 domain (S1) IgG ELISAs and a surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT). RESULTS: Individuals reporting symptoms from January 2020 onwards showed seroconversion, as did a considerable proportion of asymptomatic individuals. Seroconversion for symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals was higher in an area with a known infection cluster compared to a low incidence area. Overall, 94% of individuals with a positive IgG result by LFA were confirmed by NCP ELISA. The proportion of ELISA-confirmed LFA results declined over time, in line with contracting NCP IgG titres during longitudinal follow-up. Neutralizing antibody activity was considerably more stable than S1 and NCP IgG titres, and both reach a plateau after approximately 100 d. The sVNT proved to be not only highly specific, but also more sensitive than the specificity-focussed two-tiered serology approach. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the high specificity of two-tiered serology testing and highlight the sVNT used as a valuable tool to support modelling of SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics, complement molecular testing and provide relevant information to individuals.","Garritsen, Anja; Scholzen, Anja; van den Nieuwenhof, Daan W A; Smits, Anke P F; Datema, E Suzan; van Galen, Luc S; Kouwijzer, Milou L C E",Infect Dis (Lond),292,5

NSP3 has the property to block host innate immune response and to promote cytokine expression. NSP5 can inhibit interferon (IFN) signalling and NSP16 prevents MAD5 recognition, depressing the innate immunity. Dendritic cells, monocytes, and macrophages are the first cell lineage against viruses' infections. The IFN type I is the danger signal for the human body during this clinical setting. Protective immune responses to viral infection are initiated by innate immune sensors that survey extracellular and intracellular space for foreign nucleic acids. In Covid-19 the pathogenesis is not yet fully understood, but viral and host factors seem to play a key role. Important points in severe Covid-19 are characterized by an upregulated innate immune response, hypercoagulopathy state, pulmonary tissue damage, neurological and/or gastrointestinal tract involvement, and fatal outcome in severe cases of macrophage activation syndrome, which produce a 'cytokine storm'. These systemic conditions share polymorphous cutaneous lesions where innate immune system is involved in the histopathological findings with acute respiratory distress syndrome, hypercoagulability, hyperferritinemia, increased serum levels of D-dimer, lactic dehydrogenase, reactive-C-protein and serum A amyloid.

OBJECTIVE: To explore public attitudes to a COVID-19 contact tracing app in the United Kingdom. SETTING: Online video-conferencing. PARTICIPANTS: 27 participants, UK residents aged 18 years and older. METHODS: Qualitative study consisting of six focus groups carried out between 1st-12th May, 2020 (39-50 days into the UK 'lockdown'). RESULTS: Participants were divided as to whether or not they felt they would use the app. Analysis revealed five themes: (1) lack of information and misconceptions surrounding COVID-19 contact tracing apps; (2) concerns over privacy; (3) concerns over stigma; (4)concerns over uptake; and (5) contact tracing as the 'greater good'. Concerns over privacy, uptake and stigma were particularly significant amongst those stated they will not be using the app, and the view that the app is for the 'greater good' was particularly significant amongst those who stated they will be using the app. One of the most common misconceptions about the app was that it could allow users to specifically identify and map COVID-19 cases amongst their contacts and in their vicinity. CONCLUSIONS: Our participants were torn over whether digital contact tracing is a good idea or not, and views were heavily influenced by moral reasoning.

Among the major groups of viruses, RNA viruses contribute significantly to the global mortality and morbidity index associated with viral infection. Despite multiple routes of entry adopted by these viruses, facing complement is inevitable. The initial interaction with complement and the nature of this interaction play an important role in determining host resistance versus susceptibility to the viral infection. Many RNA viruses are potent activators of complement, often resulting in virus neutralization. Yet, another facet of virus-induced activation is the exacerbation in pathogenesis contributing to the overall morbidity. The severity in disease and death associated with RNA virus infections shows a tip in the scale favoring viruses. Growing evidence suggest that like their DNA counterparts, RNA viruses have co-evolved to master ingenious strategies to remarkably restrict complement. Modulation of host genes involved in antiviral responses contributed prominently to the adoption of unique strategies to keep complement at bay, which included either down regulation of activation components (C3, C4) or up regulation of complement regulatory proteins. All this hints at a possible ""hijacking"" of the cross-talk mechanism of the host immune system. Enveloped RNA viruses have a selective advantage of not only modulating the host responses but also recruiting membrane-associated regulators of complement activation (RCAs).

The clinical course is highly variable. Most patients recover with humoral and cell mediated immunities against reinfection. Previous studies showed immunocompetent patients with severe infections all became seropositive for immunoglobulins against COVID-19, while only a minority of patients with mild infections remained seronegative. However, immunocompromised patients can remain seronegative for up to two months with severe infections while shedding active virus. This case describes a patient on obinutuzumab who has persistently positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with persistently negative anti-SARS-CoV-2 serum immunoglobulin. Case: Our patient is a 74 year old male with follicular lymphoma on obinutuzumab. Past medical history includes obstructive sleep apnea, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He first incidentally tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 PCR but was asymptomatic. He presented to the hospital 3 weeks later for dyspnea, fevers, and cough. Computed tomography (CT) angiography of the chest was negative for pulmonary embolism but showed multifocal infiltrates and a nonocclusive thrombus in the inferior vena cava (IVC). Inflammatory markers were elevated. Patient was started on anticoagulation for his IVC thrombus. He did not require supplemental oxygen, and was discharged home after a short inpatient observation. The patient had 3 more hospitalizations over the next 30 days with acute hypoxic respiratory failure requiring supplemental oxygen. He had serial CT imaging of his chest that remained negative for pulmonary embolism but showed progressively worsening multifocal infiltrates. His inflammatory markers remained elevated (see figure 1). He tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 Immunoglobulin G (IgG) on day 27 and 36 from the initial COVID-19 diagnosis while repeat SARS-CoV-2 PCRs remained positive. Discussion: Immunocompromised patients with COVID 19 infection tend to have worse clinical outcomes. Our patient had persistently positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR and negative IgG beyond 30 days along with worsening respiratory symptoms. It is possible that the lack of IgG response may be related to the monoclonal antibody obinutuzumab against CD 20 cells. In the case of our patient, despite his persistent positivity of SARS-CoV-2 by rapid PCR test, we did not have confirmation of active infection by whole genome sequence or viral culture. However he had persistent clinical deterioration, elevated inflammatory markers, as well as worsening serial CT images suggesting a prolonged active infection. The findings in our patient may have significant implications in the isolation, management and prognosis of patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy, specifically anti CD 20 management.","Wang, J.; Abburi, A.; Molina-Pallete, G.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,292,16

Measures were put in place to address air pressures, airflow direction, aerosol generation, and the safe utilisation of existing scanning rooms and work lists for interventional procedures. RESULTS: Three hundred and thirty-one patients (164 at Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital and 167 at Royal Orthopaedic Hospital) underwent image-guided procedures at both sites in the CT and US rooms. At the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, 40% of all procedures were performed under general anaesthesia. These consisted of 47 CT biopsies, 7 CT radiofrequency ablations (RFAs), and 12 US biopsies. At the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital, 86% of all procedures were performed under local anaesthetic, with no general anaesthetic procedures. These consisted of 61 CT biopsies and 83 US biopsies. All 256 patients having procedures in the CT room had no post-procedural complications or COVID-19-related symptoms and morbidity on follow-up.

These experiments are increasingly being applied in understanding the complex impacts of heavy metals, ocean acidification, global warming, and oil spills. The insights of the present review indicate how metals and metal-bound activities impact on various aspects of ecological complexities like prey predator cues, growth, embryonic development, and reproduction. Plankton and benthos are used more often over fish and microbes owing to their smaller size, faster reproduction, amenability, and repeatability during mesocosm experiments. The results of ocean acidification reveal calcification of plankton, corals, alteration of pelagic structures, and plankton blooms. The subtle effect of oil spills is amplified on sediment microorganisms, primary producers, and crustaceans. An overview of the mesocosm designs over the years indicates that gradual changes have evolved in the type, size, design, composition, parameters, methodology employed, and the outputs obtained. Most of the pelagic and benthic mesocosm designs involve consideration of interactions within the water columns, between water and sediments, trophic levels, and nutrient rivalry. Mesocosm structures are built considering physical processes (tidal currents, turbulence, inner cycling of nutrients, thermal stratification, and mixing), biological complexities (population, community, and ecosystem) using appropriate filling containers, and sampling facilities that employ inert materials. The principle of design is easy transportation, mooring, deployment, and free floating structures besides addressing the unique ecosystem-based science problems. The evolution of the mesocosm tools helps in understanding further advancement of techniques and their applications in marine ecosystems.","Sharma, Krishna Venkatarama; Sarvalingam, Barath Kumar; Marigoudar, Shambanagouda Rudragouda",,292,1

Especially, the spike of case numbers in South Korea sparks pandemic worries. This virus is reported to spread mainly through personto- person contact via respiratory droplets generated by coughing and sneezing, or possibly through surface contaminated by people coughing or sneezing on them. More critically, there have been reports about the possibility of this virus to transmit even before a virus-carrying person to show symptoms. Therefore, a low-cost, easy-access protocol for early detection of this virus is desperately needed. Here, we have established a real-time reverse-transcription PCR (rtPCR)-based assay protocol composed of easy specimen self-collection from a subject via pharyngeal swab, Trizolbased RNA purification, and SYBR Green-based rtPCR. This protocol shows an accuracy and sensitivity limit of 1-10 virus particles as we tested with a known lentivirus. The cost for each sample is estimated to be less than 15 US dollars. Overall time it takes for an entire protocol is estimated to be less than 4 hours. We propose a cost-effective, quick-and-easy method for early detection of SARS-CoV-2 at any conventional Biosafety Level II laboratories that are equipped with a rtPCR machine.

It has caused outbreaks of illness due to person-to-person transmission of the virus mainly via close contacts and droplets produced by an infected person's cough or sneeze. Exhaled droplets from infected patients with COVID-19 can be inhaled into the lungs and leads to respiratory illness such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Although aerosol therapy is a mainstay procedure used to treat pulmonary diseases at home and healthcare settings, it has a potential for fugitive emissions during therapy due to the generation of aerosols and droplets as a source of respiratory pathogens. Delivering aerosolized medications to patients with COVID-19 can aggravate the spread of the novel coronavirus. This has been a real concern for caregivers and healthcare professionals who are susceptible to unintended inhalation of fugitive emissions during therapy. Due to a scarcity of information in this area of clinical practice, the purpose of this paper is to explain how to deliver aerosolized medications to mild-, sub-intensive, and intensive-care patients with COVID-19 and how to protect staff from exposure to exhaled droplets during aerosol therapy.","Ari, Arzu",Respir Med,292,26

However, the differences regarding the training loads and implementation between synchronous and asynchronous types are not yet known. The purpose of this study was to compare the implementation and training load between synchronous and asynchronous tele-exercise programs in individuals with spinal cord injury. METHODS: Forty individuals with spinal cord injury were recruited and stratified into tetraplegia and paraplegia groups. All subjects performed 3 weeks of both the synchronous and asynchronous tele-exercise programs, after two weeks of familiarization with the exercises, remote connection tools and methods to record information. The primary outcomes were training load (average daily workload and average and total weekly training load) and implementation (adherence and successful exercise recording). Demographic characteristics were obtained from participants' electronic medical records. RESULTS: Weekly mean workload, total workload, adherence and successful exercise recording presented significantly higher values in the synchronous compared to asynchronous tele-exercises. Average daily workload did not present significant differences between the tele-exercises. DISCUSSION: The training load for each training session presented no differences between synchronous and asynchronous tele-exercises. Both adherence and successful data recording showed more favourable implementation values for synchronous training, thus allowing greater weekly training loads (total and average).","Costa, Rodrigo Rodrigues Gomes; Dorneles, Jefferson R; Veloso, João Hcl; Gonçalves, Carlos Wp; Neto, Frederico Ribeiro",J Telemed Telecare,292,24

One prior report suggested that use of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), which downregulates TMPRSS2, may protect men with prostate cancer from infection. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cohort study of a prospective registry of all patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 between March 12 and June 10, 2020, with complete follow-up until disease recovery or death. The main exposure examined was the use of ADT, and the outcome measures were the rate of SARS-CoV-2 positivity and disease severity as a function of ADT use. RESULTS: The study cohort consisted of 1,779 men with prostate cancer from a total tested population of 74,787, of whom 4,885 (6.5%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of those with prostate cancer, 102 (5.7%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive and 304 (17.1%) were on ADT. Among those on ADT, 5.6% were positive as compared to 5.8% not on ADT. Men on ADT were slightly older (75.5 vs. 73.8 years, p=.009), more likely to have smoked (68.1% vs. 59.3%, p =.005), and more likely to report taking steroids (43.8% vs. 23.3%, p < .001). Other factors known to increase both risk of infection and disease severity were equally distributed (asthma, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart failure, and immune suppressive disease). Multivariable analysis did not indicate a difference in infection risk for those with prostate cancer on ADT (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.54-1.61, p = 0.8).

We have been investigating an approach to multiple disorders that involves recruiting the innate immune system to aid the body's healing and regenerative mechanism(s). In the case of West Nile Virus encephalitis and potentially COVID-19, the proposed intervention to stimulate the innate immune system may give the adaptive immune response the necessary time to develop, finish clearing the virus, and provide future immunity. Furthermore, we have found that GM-CSF-induced recruitment of the innate immune system is also able to reverse brain pathology, neuroinflammation and cognitive deficits in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease and Down syndrome, as well as improving cognition in normal aging and in human patients with cognitive deficits due to chemotherapy, both of which exhibit neuroinflammation. Others have shown that GM-CSF is an effective treatment for both bacterial and viral pneumonias, and their associated inflammation, in animals and that it has successfully treated pneumonia-associated Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome in humans.

In this COVID pandemic, the decision to continue elective cancer surgeries, and their subsequent outcomes, are sparsely reported from hotspots. METHODS: A prospective database of the Department of Surgical Oncology was analysed from March 23rd to April 30th, 2020. FINDINGS: Four hundred ninety-four elective surgeries were performed (377 untested and 117 tested for Covid 19 before surgery). Median age was 48 years with 13% (n = 64) above the age of 60 years. Sixty-eight percent patients were American Society of Anaesthesiology (ASA) grade I. As per surgical complexity grading, 71 (14·4%) cases were lower grade (I-III) and 423 (85.6%) were higher grade complex surgeries (IV - VI).Clavien-Dindo &#8805; grade III complications were 5.6% (n = 28) and there were no postoperative deaths.

METHODS: An owner-based questionnaire was used to grade dogs based on their respiratory signs before surgery and at least six weeks after surgery. Epidemiological data and results from presurgical pharyngeal and laryngeal examination and CT scan findings for 75 dogs undergoing airway surgery were collected from the medical records. RESULTS: 70.7 per cent of dogs showed an improvement in respiratory signs following rhinoplasty and palatoplasty. This improvement was associated with the severity of inspiratory efforts and the Poncet score on presentation, but not with any other clinical sign or anatomical abnormality found during BOAS assessment, nor by the degree of craniofacial shortening as determined by CT-scan. Presurgical snoring was positively associated with the degree of narrowing of pharyngeal dimensions. CONCLUSIONS: Dogs presenting with clinical signs of BOAS benefit from rhinoplasty and palatoplasty alone.

Both caused severe pneumonia killing 774 and 858 people with 8700 cases of confirmed infection for the former, and 2494 for the latter, causing significant economic losses. 8 years later, despite the MERS outbreak remaining in certain parts of the world, at the end of 2019, a new zoonotic coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and responsible of coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), arose from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. It spread rapidly and to date has killed 3,242 persons with more than 81,000 cases of infection in China and causing over 126,000 global cases and 5,414 deaths in 166 other countries around the world, especially Italy.

Nonetheless, as for SARS-CoV and MERS CoV, the Spillover effect linked to animal-human promiscuity, human activities including deforestation, illegal bush-trafficking and bushmeat, cannot be excluded. Recently, however, evidence of inter-human only transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been accumulated and thus, the outbreak seems to be spreading by human-to-human transmission throughout a large part of the world.

In particular, we focus on the impact when a fraction of the population uses a mobile application for epidemic control. Finally, we apply the model to COVID-19, providing several computations as examples, and a link to a public repository to run custom calculations.

The aim of this study is to explore the impacts of COVID-19 on people's mental health, to assist policy makers to develop actionable policies, and help clinical practitioners (e.g., social workers, psychiatrists, and psychologists) provide timely services to affected populations. We sample and analyze the Weibo posts from 17,865 active Weibo users using the approach of Online Ecological Recognition (OER) based on several machine-learning predictive models. We calculated word frequency, scores of emotional indicators (e.g., anxiety, depression, indignation, and Oxford happiness) and cognitive indicators (e.g., social risk judgment and life satisfaction) from the collected data. The sentiment analysis and the paired sample t-test were performed to examine the differences in the same group before and after the declaration of COVID-19 on 20 January, 2020. The results showed that negative emotions (e.g., anxiety, depression and indignation) and sensitivity to social risks increased, while the scores of positive emotions (e.g., Oxford happiness) and life satisfaction decreased. People were concerned more about their health and family, while less about leisure and friends. The results contribute to the knowledge gaps of short-term individual changes in psychological conditions after the outbreak. It may provide references for policy makers to plan and fight against COVID-19 effectively by improving stability of popular feelings and urgently prepare clinical practitioners to deliver corresponding therapy foundations for the risk groups and affected people.","Li, Sijia; Wang, Yilin; Xue, Jia; Zhao, Nan; Zhu, Tingshao",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),292,4

DESIGN: Prospective Randomised Interventional Study. SETTING: Renal Transplant Department in a tertiary centre in the United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: 200 Renal transplant patients aged between 20 and 88 years. Telephone interviews were undertaken between 1st May, 2020 and 29th May, 2020, at the height of 'shielding' from COVID-19. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomised into 2 groups, with 1 group receiving a simple 'priming question' regarding the COVID pandemic and the other group having no prior contact. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Individuals were then asked to rate their own overall lifetime happiness; desire to change; overall life satisfaction and momentary happiness on a scale of 1 to 10 for each measure. Independent sample t-tests were used to compare results between the two groups, with a type 1 error rate below 5% considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Participants' overall happiness with their life as a whole revealed that individuals who were primed with a question about COVID-19 reported increased overall happiness with their life compared to individuals who had not been primed (+0.88, 95% confidence interval 0.42 to 1.35, p = 0.0002). In addition, participants in the primed group reported less desire to change their life when compared to the non-primed group (-1.35, 95% confidence interval -2.06 to -0.65, p = 0.0002). Participants who were primed with the COVID-19 question also reported a higher overall satisfaction with their life than individuals who had not been primed (+1.01, 95% confidence interval 0.50 to 1.52, p = 0.0001). Finally, the participants who received the priming question demonstrated increased reported momentary happiness (+0.64, 95% confidence interval 0.03 to 1.24, p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that bringing salience to the COVID-19 pandemic with a simple question leads to positive changes in both momentary happiness and other components of global life satisfaction, thereby extrapolating evidence for the application of the mood-as-information theory to more extreme life circumstances. Given the importance of patient-reported evaluations, these findings have implications for how, when and where accurate and reproducible measurements of life satisfaction should be obtained.","O039,; Donnell, Alice; Wilson, Lydia; Bosch, Jos A; Borrows, Richard",PLoS One,292,16

Background: As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread across the United States starting in 2020, it caused numerous areas of medicine and healthcare to reexamine how we provide care to patients across all disciplines. One method clinicians used to rapidly adapt to these transformed settings was video telehealth, which was previously rarely used. Methods: This retrospective review examined outpatient volume and reimbursement data of a large, academic department of surgery. The study reviewed data during 2 time periods: pre-COVID-19 (February 1, 2020, to March 15, 2020) and COVID-19 (March 16, 2020, to April 30, 2020). Results: During the period of February 1 to April 30, 13,193 outpatient visits were analyzed. The pre-COVID-19 group contained 9041 (68.5%) visits, whereas the COVID-19 group contained 4152 (31.4%) visits. All divisions noted a drop in visit volume from pre-COVID-19 compared with COVID-19. There was rapid adoption of video telehealth during COVID-19, which made up most patient visits during that time (61.3%). We also found that video telehealth led to significant reimbursements while also allowing patients in numerous states to receive care. Conclusions: Previously, video telehealth was used by clinicians in a small portion of outpatient visits. However, safety concerns surrounding COVID-19 forced multiple changes to the way care is provided. Although outpatient volume at our center was less than that before the pandemic, video telehealth was rapidly adopted by providers and allowed for safe and effective outpatient care to patients in a high number of states while still being reimbursed at a high rate.","Lazar, A.

First, public perceptions of China are much more nuanced and conflicted than can be quickly gleaned from the simple dichotomy of ""favorable versus unfavorable,"" especially as one moves from overall impressions to more specific policy issues. Second, misperceptions of China are widespread and may be difficult to overcome, especially among those who already view China negatively. At a time when countries around the world are grappling with the rise of China and its expanding global footprint, failure to account for these features in public opinion about China may lead to misguided policies.

Due to the lack of effective treatment options for SARS-CoV-2, various strategies are being tested in China, including drug repurposing. In this study, we used our pre-trained deep learning-based drug-target interaction model called Molecule Transformer-Drug Target Interaction (MT-DTI) to identify commercially available drugs that could act on viral proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The result showed that atazanavir, an antiretroviral medication used to treat and prevent the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is the best chemical compound, showing an inhibitory potency with Kdof 94.94 nM against the SARS-CoV-2 3C-like proteinase, followed by remdesivir (113.13 nM), efavirenz (199.17 nM), ritonavir (204.05 nM), and dolutegravir (336.91 nM). Interestingly, lopinavir, ritonavir, and darunavir are all designed to target viral proteinases. However, in our prediction, they may also bind to the replication complex components of SARS-CoV-2 with an inhibitory potency with Kd&lt; 1000 nM. In addition, we also found that several antiviral agents, such as Kaletra (lopinavir/ritonavir), could be used for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Overall, we suggest that the list of antiviral drugs identified by the MT-DTI model should be considered, when establishing effective treatment strategies for SARS-CoV-2.","Beck, Bo Ram; Shin, Bonggun; Choi, Yoonjung; Park, Sungsoo; Kang, Keunsoo",Comput.

Standard noninvasive bilevel positive airway pressure devices with spontaneous and timed respirations (bilevel PAP ST) could provide invasive ventilation but evidence on their effectiveness in this capacity is limited. We sought to evaluate the ability of bilevel PAP ST to effect gas exchange via invasive ventilation in a healthy swine model. METHODS: Two single limb respiratory circuits with passive filtered exhalation were constructed and evaluated. Next, two bilevel PAP ST devices, designed for sleep laboratory and home use, were tested on an intubated healthy swine model using these circuits. These devices were compared to an anesthesia ventilator. RESULTS: We evaluated respiratory mechanics, minute ventilation, oxygenation, and presence of rebreathing for all of these devices. Both bilevel PAP ST devices were able to control the measured parameters. There were noted differences in performance between the two devices. Despite these differences, both devices provided effective invasive ventilation by controlling minute ventilation and providing adequate oxygenation in the animal model. CONCLUSIONS: Commercially available bilevel PAP ST can provide invasive ventilation with a single limb respiratory circuit and in-line filters to control oxygenation and ventilation without significant rebreathing in a swine model. Further study is needed to evaluate safety and efficacy in clinical disease models. In the setting of a ventilator shortage during the COVID-19 pandemic, and in other resource-constrained situations, these devices may be considered as an effective alternative means for invasive ventilation.","Foster, Brian E; Diaz-Abad, Montserrat; Hudson, Arlene J; Bedocs, Peter; Doll, Darius M; Lopez, Steven A; Mares, John; Hutzler, Justin; Robertson, Brian D",Sleep Breath,292,16

Undoubtedly the most notable results have been in the area of image synthesis and in particular in the generation of deepfake videos. While deepfakes have received much negative media coverage, they can be a useful technology in applications like entertainment, customer relations, or even assistive care. One problem with generating deepfakes is the requirement for a lot of image training data of the subject which is not an issue if the subject is a celebrity for whom many images already exist. If there are only a small number of training images then the quality of the deepfake will be poor. Some media reports have indicated that a good deepfake can be produced with as few as 500 images but in practice, quality deepfakes require many thousands of images, one of the reasons why deepfakes of celebrities and politicians have become so popular. In this study, we exploit the property of a GAN to produce images of an individual with variable facial expressions which we then use to generate a deepfake. We observe that with such variability in facial expressions of synthetic GAN-generated training images and a reduced quantity of them, we can produce a near-realistic deepfake videos.","Singh, Simranjeet; Sharma, Rajneesh; Smeaton, Alan F.",,292,1

Fungi are also widespread in epiphytic orchid roots, but there have been no attempts to determine if epiphytes accept organic matter from the living stems of their phorophytes. We hypothesise that such transfer does not exist because epiphytes and phorophytes harbour different fungal communities. To test this hypothesis, we tagged three short Randia sp. trees with 13C-enriched CO2 and examined 13C transfer from the phorophyte into the epiphytic orchids Grosourdya appendiculata, Dendrobium oligophyllum and Gastrochilus sp. in Cat Tien National Park, (South Vietnam, Cat Tien National Park, plot size approx. 1 ha). The coincidence of fungal sequences in the orchid roots and in the branches on which they grew was also examined. We did not detect 13C label moving from phorophytes to epiphytes. Using Illumina sequencing, 162 fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were detected. The fungal communities were significantly different between the roots of epiphytes and branches of phorophytes, although no strict fungal specificity at the species level was found in either epiphytes or phorophytes.","Eskov, Alen K; Voronina, Elena Yu; Tedersoo, Leho; Tiunov, Alexey V; Manh, Vu; Prilepsky, Nikolay G; Antipina, Violetta A; Elumeeva, Tatiana G; Abakumov, Evgeny V; Onipchenko, Vladimir G",Mycorrhiza,292,16

In ACTIV-2/A5401, non-hospitalized participants with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection were randomized to bamlanivimab (700mg or 7000mg) or placebo. Treatment-emergent resistance mutations were significantly more likely detected after bamlanivimab 700mg treatment than placebo (7% of 111 vs 0% of 112 participants, P=0.003). There were no treatment-emergent resistance mutations among the 48 participants who received bamlanivimab 7000mg. Participants with emerging mAb resistant virus had significantly higher pre-treatment nasopharyngeal and anterior nasal viral load. Intensive respiratory tract viral sampling revealed the dynamic nature of SARS-CoV-2 evolution, with evidence of rapid and sustained viral rebound after emergence of resistance mutations, and worsened symptom severity. Participants with emerging bamlanivimab resistance often accumulated additional polymorphisms found in current variants of concern/interest and associated with immune escape. These results highlight the potential for rapid emergence of resistance during mAb monotherapy treatment, resulting in prolonged high level respiratory tract viral loads and clinical worsening.

We sought to identify individuals with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the early weeks of the US epidemic. METHODS: All of Us study participants in all 50 US states provided blood specimens during study visits from January 2 to March 18, 2020. A participant was considered seropositive if they tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies on the Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA and the EUROIMMUN SARS-CoV-2 ELISA in a sequential testing algorithm. Sensitivity and specificity of the Abbott and EUROIMMUNE ELISAs and the net sensitivity and specificity of the sequential testing algorithm were estimated with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: The estimated sensitivity of Abbott and EUROIMMUN was 100% (107/107 [96.6%, 100%]) and 90.7% (97/107 [83.5%, 95.4%]), respectively. The estimated specificity of Abbott and EUROIMMUN was 99.5% (995/1,000 [98.8%, 99.8%]) and 99.7% (997/1,000 [99.1%, 99.9%), respectively. The net sensitivity and specificity of our sequential testing algorithm was 90.7% (97/107 [83.5%, 95.4%]) and 100.0% (1,000/1,000 [99.6%, 100%]), respectively. Of the 24,079 study participants with blood specimens from January 2 to March 18, 2020, 9 were seropositive, 7 of whom were seropositive prior to the first confirmed case in the states of Illinois, Massachusetts, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Mississippi.

In this general setting, its characterization as the spectral radius of next generation operators is rather elegant, but simultaneously poses serious obstacles to its practical determination. In this work we address the problem numerically by reducing the relevant operators to matrices through a pseudospectral collocation, eventually computing the sought quantity by solving finite-dimensional eigenvalue problems. The approach is illustrated for two classes of models, respectively from ecology and epidemiology. Several numerical tests demonstrate experimentally important features of the method, like fast convergence and influence of the smoothness of the models' coefficients.

In France, mortality rate in the general population was approximately 10% and could reach higher levels at the hospital. In the current context of high incidence rates of SARS-CoV-2 in the community, a significant increase in the rate of nosocomial transmission is expected. The risk of nosocomial transmission could even be higher in low-income countries that have fragile healthcare systems. This protocol is intended to estimate the prevalence and incidence of suspected or confirmed cases of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infection, the clinical spectrum and the determinants (risk factors/protective) at participating hospitals. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This will be an international multicentre prospective, observational, hospital-based study in adults and children. It will include volunteer patients and healthcare professionals in France and hospitals affiliated with the GABRIEL network. Demographic and clinical data will be collected using case report forms designed especially for the purpose of the project. A nasopharyngeal swab will be collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse-transcriptase PCR. Characteristics of the study participants, the proportion of confirmed nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infections relative to all patients with syndromes suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection, will be analysed. Appropriate multivariate modelling will be used to identify the determinants associated with nosocomial onset. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was approved by the clinical research and committee of all participating countries. The findings will be submitted to peer-reviewed journal for publication and shared with national health authorities.

Although some evidence has indicated the prognostic values of thrombocytopenia, neutrophilia, and lymphopenia, there are conflicting results concerning the leukocyte and monocyte count. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective Double Centre Study, we reviewed the results of WBC and monocyte counts of 1320 COVID-19 patients (243 of whom (18.4%) had severe disease) both on admission and within a 7-day follow-up. Results: We found that both the number of monocytes and the percentage of monocytosis were higher in the severe group;however, it was not Statistically significant. On the other hand, we found that not only the mean number of WBCs was significantly higher in the severe cases also leukocytosis was a common finding in this group;indicating that an increased number of WBC may probably predict a poor prognosis. Also, the monocyte count was not affected by age;however, univariate analysis showed that the percentage of leukocytosis was significantly greater in the older group (&gt;50) with an odds ratio of 1.71 (P: 0.003). Conclusion: Alteration of monocytes either on admission or within hospitalization would not provide valuable data about the prediction of COVID-19 prognosis. Although the rapidly evolving nature of COVID-19 is the major limitation of the present Andy, further investigations in the field of laboratory biomarkers will pave the way to manage patients with severe disease better.","Pirsalehi, A.; Salari, S.; Baghestani, A.; Sanadgol, G.; Shirini, D.; Baerz, M.

However, increasing reports show that some tumors are resistant to metformin. Identification of factors affecting metformin mediated cancer therapy is of great significance. FGFR1 is a receptor-tyrosine-kinase that is frequently overexpressed in breast cancer, which is associated with poor-prognosis. To investigate the effect of FGFR1 overexpression on metformin-induced inhibition of breast cancer cells, we demonstrated that FGFR1 overexpression rendered MCF-7 and T47D cells resistant to metformin. In particular, we found that, in addition to AKT and ERK1/2 activation, FGFR1-induced activation of IRS1 and IGF1R, key regulators connecting metabolism and cancer, was associated with metformin resistance. Targeting IRS with IRS1 KO or IRS inhibitor NT157 significantly sensitized FGFR1 overexpressing cells to metformin. Combination of NT157 with metformin induced enhanced inhibition of p-IGF1R, p-ERK1/2 and p-mTOR. Moreover, we demonstrated that IRS1 functions as a critical mediator of the crosstalk between FGFR1 and IGF1R pathways, which involves a feedback loop between IRS1 and MAPK/ERK. Our study highlights the significance of FGFR1 status and IRS1 activation in metformin-resistance, which will facilitate the development of strategies targeting FGFR overexpression-associated metformin resistance.","Shi, Yujie; Ma, Zhikun; Cheng, Qiong; Wu, Yudan; Parris, Amanda B; Kong, Lingfei; Yang, Xiaohe",Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Cell Res,292,1

Participants were 37 caregivers of children/adolescents with ASD, also 35 ASD adults and 32 informants. Evaluation was conducted through a web survey system and included standardized clinical questionnaires (CBCL and SCL-90-R), which were compared with results before lockdown start, and a brief self-reported survey addressing the subjective perception of changes in daily functioning areas. The results revealed a reduction of psychopathological symptoms in both age groups, but only reaching statistical significance in the adult group, except for Somatization, Anxiety, and Obsessive-Compulsive domains. ASD severity Level 2 showed greater improvement after lockdown onset in the children/adolescent group when compared to ASD Level 1 participants. Younger adults (18-25 yoa) reported greater improvement than older adults (=>25 yoa). Survey results indicate an improvement of feeding quality and a reduction in the number of social initiations during the lockdown. Adult ASD participants perceived a decrease in stress levels after the lockdown onset, whereas caregivers reported higher stress levels at the same point in both age groups. Limitations included the small number of participants and a heterogeneous evaluation window between measures.

When zoonotic viruses jump to a new host, they undergo both mutational and natural selective pressures that result in non-synonymous and synonymous adaptive changes, necessary for efficient replication and rapid spread of diseases in new host species. The nucleotide composition and codon usage pattern of SARS-CoV-2 indicate the presence of a highly conserved, gene-specific codon usage bias. The codon usage pattern of SARS-CoV-2 is mostly antagonistic to human and bat codon usage. SARS-CoV-2 codon usage bias is mainly shaped by the natural selection, while mutational pressure plays a minor role. The time-series analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genome indicates that the virus is slowly evolving.

Through an established academic-practice partnership, pre-licensure nursing students were able to fill this new Patient Services Aid role. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the students' experiences in this mutually beneficial innovative role. METHODS: Electronic surveys and qualitative focus groups were used to evaluate the students' experiences. RESULTS: A total of 34 students were employed at the health system as PSAs. Focus groups (n = 16) analysis showed that, while the role was not a substitute for academic clinical experiences, they did improve the students' confidence in the clinical setting and helped teach necessary non-technical skills. Students appreciated the ability to network with multiple disciplines while working as PSAs. CONCLUSIONS: This role was developed to assist with immediate COVID-19 needs; however, this model of using pre-licensure students in non-clinical roles can improve students' non-technical skills and confidence in the clinical setting.

The recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants emphasized the need to enlarge the repertoire of antibodies that target diverse epitopes, the combination of which may improve immune-diagnostics, augment the efficiency of the immunotherapy and prevent selection of escape-mutants. Antigen-specific controlled immunization of experimental animals may elicit antibody repertoires that significantly differ from those generated in the context of the immune response mounted in the course of disease. Accordingly, rabbits were immunized by several recombinant antigens representing distinct domains of the viral spike protein and monoclonal antibodies were isolated from single cells obtained by cell sorting. Characterization of a panel of successfully isolated anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) and anti-N-terminal domain (NTD) antibodies demonstrated that they exhibit high specificity and affinity profiles. Anti-RBD antibodies revealing significant neutralizing potency against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro were found to target at least three distinct epitopes. Epitope mapping established that two of these antibodies recognized a novel epitope located on the surface of the RBD. We suggest that the antibodies isolated in this study are useful for designing SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis and therapy approaches.","Makdasi, Efi; Levy, Yinon; Alcalay, Ron; Noy-Porat, Tal; Zahavy, Eran; Mechaly, Adva; Epstein, Eyal; Peretz, Eldar; Cohen, Hila; Bar-On, Liat; Chitlaru, Theodor; Cohen, Ofer; Glinert, Itai; Achdout, Hagit; Israely, Tomer; Rosenfeld, Ronit; Mazor, Ohad",Viruses,292,18

We have studied innate and adaptive immunity on protein and transcriptomic level in COVID-19 patients with different disease severity at admission and longitudinally during hospitalization. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected at three time points from 31 patients included in the Norwegian SARS-CoV-2 cohort study and analysed by flow cytometry and RNA sequencing. Patients were grouped as either mild/moderate (n = 14), severe (n = 11) or critical (n = 6) disease in accordance with WHO guidelines and compared with patients with SARS-CoV-2-negative bacterial sepsis (n = 5) and healthy controls (n = 10). RESULTS: COVID-19 severity was characterized by decreased interleukin 7 receptor alpha chain (CD127) expression in naïve CD4 and CD8 T cells. Activation (CD25 and HLA-DR) and exhaustion (PD-1) markers on T cells were increased compared with controls, but comparable between COVID-19 severity groups. Non-classical monocytes and monocytic HLA-DR expression decreased whereas monocytic PD-L1 and CD142 expression increased with COVID-19 severity. RNA sequencing exhibited increased plasma B-cell activity in critical COVID-19 and yet predominantly reduced transcripts related to immune response pathways compared with milder disease. CONCLUSION: Critical COVID-19 seems to be characterized by an immune profile of activated and exhausted T cells and monocytes. This immune phenotype may influence the capacity to mount an efficient T-cell immune response. Plasma B-cell activity and calprotectin were higher in critical COVID-19 while most transcripts related to immune functions were reduced, in particular affecting B cells. The potential of these cells as therapeutic targets in COVID-19 should be further explored.","Christensen, E E; Jørgensen, M J; Nore, K G; Dahl, T B; Yang, K; Ranheim, T; Huse, C; Lind, A; Nur, S; Stiksrud, B; Jenum, S; Tonby, K; Holter, J C; Holten, A R; Halvorsen, B; Dyrhol-Riise, A M",J. intern. med,292,16

We compared the CT features of common cases and severe cases, symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients, and febrile and afebrile patients. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of the clinical and thoracic CT features of 120 consecutive patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia admitted to a tertiary university hospital between January 10 and February 10, 2020, in Wuhan city, China. RESULTS: On admission, the patients generally complained of fever, cough, shortness of breath, and myalgia or fatigue, with diarrhea often present in severe cases. Severe patients were 20 years older on average and had comorbidities and an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level. There were no differences in the CT findings between asymptomatic and symptomatic common type patients or between afebrile and febrile patients, defined according to Chinese National Health Commission guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical and CT features at admission may enable clinicians to promptly evaluate the prognosis of patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Clinicians should be aware that clinically silent cases may present with CT features similar to those of symptomatic common patients. KEY POINTS: â¢ The clinical features and predominant patterns of abnormalities on CT for asymptomatic, typic common, and severe cases were summarized. These findings may help clinicians to identify severe patients quickly at admission. â¢ Clinicians should be cautious that CT findings of afebrile/asymptomatic patients are not better than the findings of other types of patients. These patients should also be quarantined. â¢ The use of chest CT as the main screening method in epidemic areas is recommended.","Zhang, Rui; Ouyang, Huangqing; Fu, Lingli; Wang, Shijie; Han, Jianglong; Huang, Kejie; Jia, Mingfang; Song, Qibin; Fu, Zhenming",Eur Radiol,292,16

In this study, a Chinese PDCoV strain, designated CHN-HN-1601, was isolated from the faeces of a diarrhoeic piglet. After plaque purification, the genome was determined which shared 97.5%-99.5% nucleotide identities with 71 representative PDCoV strains available in the GenBank. The pathogenic properties of CHN-HN-1601 were evaluated using 5-day-old piglets. All inoculated piglets developed severe diarrhoea from 2 days post-infection (dpi) onwards. To our surprise, two periods of diarrhoea starting from 2 to 7 dpi and from 13 to 19 dpi were observed in affected piglets during the experiment. Faecal viral shedding of the inoculated piglets was detected by real-time RT-PCR, with viral shedding peaked at 4 and 16 dpi, respectively. At necropsy at 5 dpi, the main gross lesions included transparent, thin-walled and gas-distended intestines containing yellow watery contents. Further histopathological examinations, including haematoxylin and eosin staining, immunohistochemistry and RNAscope in situ hybridization, revealed that the virus infection caused severe villous atrophy of the small intestines, with PDCoV antigen and RNA mainly distributed in the cytoplasm of the villous epithelial cells of jejunum and ileum in piglets. The dynamic production of PDCoV-specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies in serum of the affected piglets was also assessed using a whole virus-based ELISA and an immunofluorescence assay-based neutralization test, respectively. Furthermore, a full-length cDNA infectious clone of CHN-HN-1601 was constructed using a bacterial artificial chromosome system. The rescued virus exhibited in vitro growth and pathogenic properties similar to the parental virus. Taken together, our study not only enriches the information of PDCoV, but also provides a useful reverse genetics platform for further pathogenesis exploration of the virus.","Zhou, Xinrong; Zhou, Lei; Zhang, Pingping; Ge, Xinna; Guo, Xin; Han, Jun; Zhang, Yongning; Yang, Hanchun",Transbound. emerg. dis.

Due to the lack of specific medication and vaccination, drug-repurposing attempts has emerged as a promising approach and identified several human proteins interacting with the virus. This study aims to provide a comprehensive molecular profiling of the immune cell-enriched SARS-CoV-2 interacting protein USP13. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The list of immune cell-enriched proteins interacting with SARS-CoV-2 was retrieved from The Human Protein Atlas. Genomic alterations were identified using cBioPortal. Survival analysis was performed via Kaplan-Meier Plotter. Analyses of protein expression and tumor infiltration levels were carried out by TIMER. KEY FINDINGS: 14 human proteins that interact with SARS-CoV-2 were enriched in immune cells. Among these proteins, USP13 had the highest frequency of genomic alterations. Higher USP13 levels were correlated with improved survival in breast and lung cancers, while resulting in poor prognosis in ovarian and gastric cancers. Furthermore, copy number variations of USP13 significantly affected the infiltration levels of distinct subtypes of immune cells in head & neck, lung, ovarian and stomach cancers. Although our results suggested a tumor suppressor role for USP13 in lung cancer, in other cancers, its role seemed to be context-dependent. SIGNIFICANCE: It is critical to identify and characterize human proteins that interact with SARS-CoV-2 in order to have a better understanding of the disease and to develop better therapies/vaccines. Here, we provided a comprehensive molecular profiling the immune cell-enriched SARS-CoV-2 interacting protein USP13, which will be useful for future studies.","Biterge Süt, Burcu",Life Sci,292,12

METHODS: A web-based cross-sectional survey was administered to 117 infertile patients at our center who had their infertility treatment delayed due to suspension of care at our hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey consisted of 52-question multiple-choice questions including the Life Orientation Test-Revised (LOT-R) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) instruments. Characteristics of respondents who ""agreed"" (strongly agree and agree) that ""delaying treatment has permanently impacted my chances at future conception"" were compared with participants who ""disagreed"" (neutral, disagree, and strongly disagree) using Fischer's exact test. RESULTS: In total, 79.5% agreed that delaying treatment has permanently impacted their chances at future conception. There were no discernible demographic differences between patients who ""agreed"" versus ""disagreed"" with the above statement. The mean LOT-R score was 14.1 (5.1) with an optimism score of 6.8 (2.6) and a pessimism score of 7.3 (2.9).

Animal models are being generated to assess late-effects of chemotherapy on cognitive function. Although, few address juvenile models of chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment (CICI) and developing brain, results of this review outline neurocognitive effects of chemotherapy consistent with childhood ALL therapy. Studies demonstrate deficits across cognitive domains including spatial memory, executive function, short-term memory, anxiety and depression. Inflammation, oxidative stress, excitotoxity, and other metabolic disruptions may lead to neurodegeneration associated with cognitive impairment observed in ALL survivors. Interventions directly targeting these mechanisms may prevent and/or promote recovery of cognitive function and improve long-term outcomes.

AIMS: We studied the pattern of spatial association between post-acute care services and acute care facilities and evaluated how geographic variability could influence their use. METHODS: We compiled data on CMS-certified acute care and critical access hospitals and post-acute health care services (nursing homes, home health care services, inpatient rehabilitation facilities, long-term care hospitals, and hospice facilities). We used the colocation quotient (CLQ) to measure the magnitude and direction of association (clustering or segregation) between post-acute care providers and hospitals. This metric allows pairwise comparison of categorical data; a value <1 indicates spatial segregation and a value >1 spatial clustering. Unity marks the lack of spatial dependence (random distribution). RESULTS: With the exception of nursing homes (CLQ 1.26), all other types of post-acute care providers are spatially segregated from rural critical access hospitals. Long-term care facilities ranked first (had the lowest global CLQ, 0.06), hospice facilities ranked last (had the highest global CLQ estimate, 0.54). Instead, post-acute care services either clustered with (inpatient rehabilitation 2.76, long-term care 2.10, nursing homes 1.37) or were only weakly segregated (home health care 0.86) from acute care hospitals. Home health care (1.44), hospice services (1.46), and nursing homes (1.08) spatially clustered with the same category of services. Results were robust in the sensitivity analysis and we provided illustrative examples of local variation for the states of MA and IA. CONCLUSION: Post-acute care services are isolated from critical access hospitals, and have a clustering pattern with the same category services and acute care hospitals. Such misdistribution of resources may result in both underuse and a substitution effect on the type of post-acute care between rural and urban areas and undermine public health during increasing demand, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ziakas, Panayiotis D; Mylonakis, Eleftherios",PLoS One,292,23

The socioeconomic costs of these blunt measures are expected to be high, especially in sub-Saharan Africa where many live hand-to-mouth and lack social safety nets. Social Accounting Matrix multiplier model results show that Ghana's urban lockdown, although in force for only three weeks in April 2020, has likely caused GDP to fall by 27.9% during that period, while an additional 3.8 million Ghanaians temporarily became poor. Compared to the government's revised GDP growth rate of 1.5% for 2020, the model predicts a contraction of 0.6 to 6.3% for 2020, depending on the speed of the recovery.

The insertion of one or more fluorine atoms adjacent to a C-terminal ketone moiety greatly modifies the physicochemical properties of the overall substrate, especially by increasing the reactivity of this functionalized carbonyl group toward nucleophiles. The main application of these peptidyl &#945;-fluorinated ketones in medicinal chemistry relies in their ability to strongly and selectively inhibit serine and cysteine proteases. These compounds can be used as probes to study the proteolytic activity of the aforementioned proteases and to elucidate their role in the insurgence and progress on several diseases. Likewise, if the fluorinated methyl ketone moiety is suitably connected to a peptidic backbone, it may confer to the resulting structure an excellent substrate peculiarity and the possibility of being recognized by a specific subclass of human or pathogenic proteases. Therefore, peptidyl fluoromethyl ketones are also currently highly exploited for the target-based design of compounds for the treatment of topical diseases such as various types of cancer and viral infections.","Citarella, Andrea; Micale, Nicola",Molecules (Basel),292,1

These interactions mediate both the traffic of inflammatory cells and virus-associated immune responses. In the context of viral infections, the human C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) receives great attention from the scientific community due to its role as an HIV-1 co-receptor. The genetic variant CCR5&#916;32 (32 base-pair deletion in CCR5 gene) impairs CCR5 expression on the cell surface and is associated with protection against HIV infection in homozygous individuals. Also, the genetic variant CCR5&#916;32 modifies the CCR5-mediated inflammatory responses in various conditions, such as inflammatory and infectious diseases. CCR5 antagonists mimic, at least in part, the natural effects of the CCR5&#916;32 in humans, which explains the growing interest in the potential benefits of using CCR5 modulators for the treatment of different diseases. Nevertheless, beyond HIV infection, understanding the effects of the CCR5&#916;32 variant in multiple viral infections is essential to shed light on the potential effects of the CCR5 modulators from a broader perspective. In this context, this review discusses the involvement of CCR5 and the effects of the CCR5&#916;32 in human infections caused by the following pathogens: West Nile virus, Influenza virus, Human papillomavirus, Hepatitis B virus, Hepatitis C virus, Poliovirus, Dengue virus, Human cytomegalovirus, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, Enterovirus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and Hantavirus. Subsequently, this review addresses the impacts of CCR5 gene editing and CCR5 modulation on health and viral diseases. Also, this article connects recent findings regarding extracellular vesicles (e.g., exosomes), viruses, and CCR5. Neglected and emerging topics in ""CCR5 research"" are briefly described, with focus on Rocio virus, Zika virus, Epstein-Barr virus, and Rhinovirus.

Among the diseases associated with protein aggregates, for example, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is of relevant importance. Although understanding the processes that cause the disease is still an open challenge, its relationship with protein aggregation is widely known. In particular, human TDP-43, an RNA/DNA binding protein, is a major component of pathological cytoplasmic inclusions described in ALS patients. The deposition of the phosphorylated full-length TDP-43 in spinal cord cells has been widely studied, and it has been shown that the brain cortex presents an accumulation of phosphorylated C-terminal fragments (CTFs). Even if it is debated whether CTFs represent a primary cause of ALS, they are a hallmark of TDP-43 related neurodegeneration in the brain. Here, we investigate the CTFs aggregation process, providing a possible computational model of interaction based on the evaluation of shape complementarity at the interfaces. To this end, extensive Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations were conducted for different types of fragments with the aim of exploring the equilibrium configurations. Adopting a newly developed approach based on Zernike polynomials, for finding complementary regions of the molecular surface, we sampled a large set of exposed portions of the molecular surface of CTFs structures as obtained from MD simulations. The analysis proposes a set of possible associations between the CTFs, which could drive the aggregation process of the CTFs.","Grassmann, Greta; Miotto, Mattia; Rienzo, Lorenzo Di; Salaris, Federico; Silvestri, Beatrice; Zacco, Elsa; Rosa, Alessandro; Tartaglia, Gian Gaetano; Ruocco, Giancarlo; Milanetti, Edoardo",,292,24

It is critical to be aware of and timely recognize neurological and neuroradiological manifestations affecting patients with COVID-19, to minimize morbidity and mortality of affected patients. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of patients admitted to our Level 1 trauma and stroke center during the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak in New York from March 1st to May 30, 2020, with a positive test for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) who presented mainly with neurological findings and had acute radiological brain changes on Computed Tomography (CT) scan. Patients with known chronic neurological disease processes were excluded from the study. We obtained and reviewed demographics, complete blood count, metabolic panel, D-dimer, inflammatory markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C reactive protein (CRP), imaging, and patient's hospital course. We reviewed the current literature on neuroimaging, pathophysiology, and their clinical correlations on COVID-19. This case series study was approved by our institutional review board. Result: A total of 16 patients were selected for our case series. The most common neuroimaging features on CT, were territorial to multifocal ischemic infarcts, followed by a combination of ischemia and acute white matter encephalopathic changes, followed by temporal lobe predominant focal or more generalized encephalopathy with both confluent and non-confluent patterns, isolated cortical or more extensive intracranial hemorrhages and some combination of ischemia or hemorrhage and white matter changes. All our patients had severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), most of them had elevated inflammatory markers, and D dimer. Conclusion: COVID-19 infection is a multi-organ disease, which can manifest as rapidly progressive neurological disease beyond the more common pulmonary presentation. Early recognition of various neurological findings and neuroimaging patterns in these patients will enable timely diagnosis and rapid treatment to reduce morbidity and mortality. Our retrospective study is limited due to small non-representative sample size, strict selection criteria likely underestimating the true extent of neurological manifestations of COVID-19, mono-modality imaging technique limited to predominantly CT scans and lack of CSF analysis in all except one patient. Multi-institutional, multi-modality, largescale studies are needed with radio-pathological correlation to better understand the complete spectrum of neurologic presentations in COVID-19 patients and study the causal relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and CNS disease process.","Rehmani, Razia; Segan, Scott; Maddika, Srikanth Reddy; Lei, Yadanar Win; Broka, Andrea",Brain Behav Immun Health,292,17

To collect the samples, the mothers wore surgical masks, washed their hands with an 85% alcohol-based gel, and washed their breast with gauze that was saturated with soap and water. Results: We obtained seven colostrum samples from different mothers in the first hours postdelivery. SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in any of the colostrum samples obtained in our study. Conclusion: In our study, breast milk was not a source of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

Students' presence in the operating theater and on wards is reduced to a bare minimum and face-to-face teaching is diminished. Aim of this study was therefore to evaluate alternative but feasible educational concepts, such as an online-only-platform for undergraduates. OBJECTIVE: A new online platform for undergraduate surgical education was implemented. A virtual curriculum for online-only education was designed. METHODS: A video-based online platform was designed. Following this, a cohort of medical students participating in a (voluntary) surgical course was randomized into a test and control group. Prior to conducting a written exam, students in the test group prepared using the video platform. Students in the control group prepared with standard surgical text books. Results of the exam were used to compare educational means. RESULTS: Students in the test group preparing through the video-based online platform reached significantly higher scores in the written exams (p = 0.0001) than students of the control group. A trend towards reduced preparation time that did not reach statistical significance was detectable in the test group (p = 0.090). Scores of ""perceived workload"" and ""desire to become a surgeon"" offered no differences between the groups. (p = 0.474 and 1.000). CONCLUSIONS: An online-only, virtual curriculum proved feasible for surgical education in undergraduates. While blended learning concepts were applied in both groups, only the test group had access to case-based videos of surgical procedures and scored significantly better in the written exams. Thus, video-based virtual education offers a realistic alternative to face-to-face teaching or conventional text books in times of restricted access to the operating theatre.","Schmitz, Sophia M; Schipper, Sandra; Lemos, Martin; Alizai, Patrick H; Kokott, Elda; Brozat, Jonathan F; Neumann, Ulf P; Ulmer, Tom F",BMC Surg,292,24

The methodology met the criteria of a novel, promising approach to treat successfully elderly COVID-19 patients, particularly when hospitalized in intensive care units (ICUs) Experimental design: We investigated the therapeutic effect of 4 cycles of O2-O3 in 50 hospitalized COVID-19 subjects suffering from acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS), aged more than 60 years, all males and undergoing non invasive mechanical ventilation in ICUs. RESULTS: Following O2-O3 treatment a significant improvement in inflammation and oxygenation indexes occurred rapidly and within the first 9 days after the treatment, despite the expected 14-20 days. A significant reduction of inflammatory and thromboembolic markers (CRP, IL-6, D-dimer) was observed. Furthermore, amelioration in the major respiratory indexes, such as respiratory and gas exchange markers (SatO2%, PaO2/FiO2 ratio), was reported. CONCLUSION: Our results show that O2-O3 treatment would be a promising therapy for COVID-19 patients. It leads patients to a fast recovery from ARDS via the improvement of major respiratory indexes and blood gas parameters, following a relatively short time of dispensed forced ventilation (about one to two weeks). This study may encourage the scientific community to further investigate and evaluate the proposed method for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.","Franzini, Marianno; Valdenassi, Luigi; Ricevuti, Giovanni; Chirumbolo, Salvatore; Depfenhart, Markus; Bertossi, Dario; Tirelli, Umberto",Int Immunopharmacol,292,29

Meanwhile, information and communication technologies (ICT), such as the internet, mobile phones, and smartphones, are spreading worldwide, including in low- and middle-income countries. We reviewed the available evidence on the use of ICT-based interventions to address intimate partner violence (IPV), evaluating the effectiveness, acceptability, and suitability of ICT for addressing different aspects of the problem (e.g., awareness, screening, prevention, treatment, mental health). METHODS: We conducted a systematic review, following PRISMA guidelines, using the following databases: PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. Key search terms included women, violence, domestic violence, intimate partner violence, information, communication technology, ICT, technology, email, mobile, phone, digital, ehealth, web, computer, online, and computerized. Only articles written in English were included. RESULTS: Twenty-five studies addressing screening and disclosure, IPV prevention, ICT suitability, support and women's mental health were identified. The evidence reviewed suggests that ICT-based interventions were effective mainly in screening, disclosure, and prevention. However, there is a lack of homogeneity among the studies' outcome measurements and the sample sizes, the control groups used (if any), the type of interventions, and the study recruitment space. Questions addressing safety, equity, and the unintended consequences of the use of ICT in IPV programming are virtually non-existent. CONCLUSIONS: There is a clear need to develop women-centered ICT design when programming for IPV. Our study showed only one study that formally addressed software usability. The need for more research to address safety, equity, and the unintended consequences of the use of ICT in IPV programming is paramount. Studies addressing long term effects are also needed.","El Morr, Christo; Layal, Manpreet",BMC Public Health,292,20

Although wild birds are reservoir hosts for a high diversity of gamma- and deltacoronaviruses, we have little understanding of the ecology or evolution of any of these viruses. In this review, we use genome sequence and ecological data to disentangle the evolution of coronaviruses in wild birds. Specifically, we explore host range at the levels of viral genus and species, and reveal the multi-host nature of many viral species, albeit with biases to certain types of avian host. We conclude that it is currently challenging to infer viral ecology due to major sampling and technical limitations, and suggest that improved assay performance across the breadth of gamma- and deltacoronaviruses, assay standardization, as well as better sequencing approaches, will improve both the repeatability and interpretation of results. Finally, we discuss cross-species virus transmission across both the wild bird - poultry interface as well as from birds to mammals. Clarifying the ecology and diversity in the wild bird reservoir has important ramifications for our ability to respond to the likely future emergence of coronaviruses in socioeconomically important animal species or human populations.","Wille, Michelle; Holmes, Edward C",FEMS Microbiol Rev,292,1

The purpose of this study was to document how the experience of providing medical assistance in dying (MAiD) changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study using semistructured interviews with key informants in Canada who provided or coordinated MAiD before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We interviewed participants from April to June 2020 by telephone or email. We collected and analyzed data in an iterative manner and reached theme saturation. Our team reached consensus on the major themes and subthemes. RESULTS: We interviewed 1 MAiD coordinator and 15 providers, including 14 physicians and 1 nurse practitioner. We identified 4 main themes. The most important theme was the perception that the pandemic increased the suffering of patients receiving MAiD by isolating them from loved ones and reducing available services. Providers were distressed by the difficulty of establishing rapport and closeness at the end of life, given the requirements for physical distancing and personal protective equipment. They were concerned about the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and found it difficult to enforce rules about distancing and the number of people present. Logistics and access to MAiD became more difficult because of the new restrictions, but there were many adaptations to solve these problems. INTERPRETATION: Providers and coordinators had many challenges in providing MAiD during the COVID-19 pandemic, including their perception that the suffering of their patients increased. Some changes in how MAiD is provided that have occurred during the pandemic, including more telemedicine assessments and virtual witnessing, are likely to remain after the pandemic and may improve service.","Wiebe, Ellen; Kelly, Michaela; McMorrow, Thomas; Tremblay-Huet, Sabrina; Sum, Brian; Hennawy, Mirna",CMAJ Open,292,16

Severity of the disease may be associated with several factors. Here, we review clinical features of COVID-19 inpatients with different severities. This cross-sectional study was performed in Imam Reza hospital, Mashhad, Iran, during February-April 2020. COVID-19 patients with typical computed tomography (CT) patterns and/or positive reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were included. The patients were classified into three groups of moderate, severe, and critical based on disease severity. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiologic findings were collected and compared. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Overall, 200 patients with mean age of 69.75 ± 6.39 years, of whom 82 (41%) were female were studied. Disease was severe/critical in the majority of patients (167, 83.5%). Disease severity was significantly associated with age, malignant comorbidities, dyspnea, nausea/vomiting, confusion, respiratory rate, pulse rate, O2 saturation, extent of CT involvement, serum C-reactive protein (CRP), pH, pO2, and aspartate transaminase (P < 0.05). Moreover, complications including shock, coagulopathy, acidosis, sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and intubation were significantly higher in patients with higher severities (P < 0.05). O2 saturation, nausea/vomiting, and extent of lung CT involvement were independent predictors of severe/critical COVID-19 (OR 0.342, 45.93, and 25.48, respectively; P < 0.05). Our results indicate O2 saturation, nausea/vomiting, and extent of lung CT involvement as independent predictors of severe COVID-19 conditions. Serum CRP levels and pO2 were also considerably higher patients with higher severity and can be used along with other factors to predict severe disease in COVID-19 patients.","Nabavi, Shima; Javidarabshahi, Zahra; Allahyari, Abolghasem; Ramezani, Mohammad; Seddigh-Shamsi, Mohsen; Ravanshad, Sahar; AkbariRad, Mina; Ebrahimzadeh, Farnoosh; Khatami, Shohre; Emadzadeh, Maryam; Saeedian, Neda; Zarifian, Ahmadreza; Miri, Maryam; Rezaeetalab, Fariba; Hejazi, Sepide; Basiri, Reza; Mozdourian, Mahnaz",Sci Rep,292,20

However, Taiwan is a country with a low COVID-19 threat, and people's daily lives have remained mostly unchanged during this period. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the trend of trauma incidence and the service of trauma care is affected by the relatively minor COVID-19 pandemic in Taiwan. DESIGN: A single-institute, retrograde cohort study. SETTING: An observational study based on the trauma registry of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (CGMH). PARTICIPANTS: Trauma patients presented to the emergency department of CGMH in the period of 1 January to 30 June 2020 (week 1 to week 26) were designated as the COVID-19 group, with 1980 patients in total. Patients of the same period in 2015-2019 were designated as the pre-COVID-19 group, with 10 334 patients overall. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome is the incidence of trauma admission. Differences in trauma mechanism, severity, location and outcome were also compared in both groups. RESULTS: A decrease in trauma incidence during March and April 2020 was noticed. Significant change (p<0.001) in trauma mechanisms was discovered, with decreased burn (5.8% vs 3.6%) and assault (4.8% vs 1.2%), and increased transport accidents (43.2% vs 47.2%) and suicide (0.2% vs 1.0%) in the COVID-19 cohort. A shift in injury locations was also found with a 5% decrement of workplace injuries (19.8% vs 14.8%, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The limited COVID-19 outbreak in Taiwan has led to a decreased incidence of trauma patients, and the reduction is mostly attributed to the decline in workplace injuries.","Kuo, Ling-Wei; Fu, Chih-Yuan; Liao, Chien-An; Liao, Chien-Hung; Wu, Yu-Tung; Huang, Jen-Fu; Hsieh, Chi-Hsun; Cheng, Chi-Tung",BMJ Open,292,16

This article describes a hospital-based transport team's experience with interfacility transport of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-positive patients. METHODS: A retrospective study of transports for respiratory failure caused by SARS-CoV-2 was performed. All transports were performed by a single critical care transport team. The team was already trained in advanced mechanical ventilation, blood gas interpretation, and management of shock. Guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was followed regarding the use of personal protective equipment. RESULTS: Twenty patients were enrolled. The average patient age was 47 years (standard deviation [SD]â¯=â¯12 years). The average Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores were 10 (SDâ¯=â¯4) and 24 (SDâ¯=â¯7), respectively.

One important question that remains is whether the protection conferred by vaccines wanes over time. However, estimates over time are subject to bias from differential depletion of susceptibles between vaccinated and unvaccinated groups. Here we examine the extent to which biases occur under different scenarios and assess whether serologic testing has the potential to correct this bias. By identifying non-vaccine antibodies, these tests could identify individuals with prior infection. We find in scenarios with high baseline VE, differential depletion of susceptibles creates minimal bias in VE estimates, suggesting that any observed declines are likely not due to spurious waning alone. However, if baseline VE is lower, the bias for leaky vaccines (that reduce individual probability of infection given contact) is larger and should be corrected by excluding individuals with past infection if the mechanism is known to be leaky. Conducting analyses both unadjusted and adjusted for past infection could give lower and upper bounds for the true VE. Studies of VE should therefore enroll individuals regardless of prior infection history but also collect information, ideally through serologic testing, on this critical variable.","Kahn, Rebecca; Schrag, Stephanie J; Verani, Jennifer R; Lipsitch, Marc",,292,30

We here show that ZC3H5 is an essential cytoplasmic RNA-binding protein: RNAi targeting ZC3H5 causes accumulation of pre-cytokinetic cells followed by rapid cell death. Affinity purification and pair-wise yeast 2-hybrid analysis suggest that ZC3H5 forms a complex with three other proteins, encoded by genes Tb927.11.4900, Tb927.8.1500 and Tb927.7.3040. RNA immunoprecipitation revealed that ZC3H5 is preferentially associated with poorly translated, low-stability mRNAs, the 5'-untranslated regions and coding regions of which are enriched in the motif (U/A)UAG(U/A). As previously found in high-throughput analyses, artificial tethering of ZC3H5 to a reporter mRNA or other complex components repressed reporter expression. However, depletion of ZC3H5 in vivo caused only very minor decreases in a few targets, marked increases in the abundances of very stable mRNAs, an increase in monosomes at the expense of large polysomes, and appearance of ""halfmer"" disomes containing two 80S subunits and one 40S subunit. We speculate that the ZC3H5 complex might be implicated in quality control during the translation of sub-optimal open reading frames.","Bajak, Kathrin; Leiss, Kevin; Clayton, Christine; Erben, Esteban",J. biol. chem,292,22

It is known that all cases do not spread the infection equally; super spreaders play an important role as they contribute disproportionately to a much larger number of cases including in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Super spreaders have been reported for more than a century, but limited information is available in scientific literature. An epidemic containment strategy needs to include early identification of super spreaders to limit an explosive growth. Super spreaders tend to get stigmatized, resulting in late reporting and hiding of cases.

The mental status of patients with COVID-19 who have been quarantined and the interactions between their psychological distress and physiological levels of inflammation have yet to be analyzed. Using a mixed-method triangulation design (QUAN + QUAL), this study investigated and compared the mental status and inflammatory markers of 103 patients who, while hospitalized with mild symptoms, tested positive with COVID-19 and 103 matched controls that were COVID-19 negative. The severity of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) was measured via an on-line survey. Using a convenience sampling technique, qualitative data were collected until the point of data saturation. In addition, a semi-structured interview was conducted among five patients with COVID-19. Peripheral inflammatory markers were also collected in patients, both at baseline and within ± three days of completing the on-line survey. Results revealed that COVID-19 patients, when compared to non-COVID controls, manifested higher levels of depression (P < 0.001), anxiety (P < 0.001), and post-traumatic stress symptoms (P < 0.001). A gender effect was observed in the score of ""Perceived Helplessness"", the subscale of PSS-10, with female patients showing higher scores compared to male patients (Z = 2.56, P = 0.010), female (Z = 2.37, P = 0.018) and male controls (Z = 2.87, P = 0.004). Levels of CRP, a peripheral inflammatory indicator, correlated positively with the PHQ-9 total score (R = 0.37, P = 0.003, Spearman's correlation) of patients who presented symptoms of depression. Moreover, the change of CRP level from baseline inversely correlated with the PHQ-9 total score (R = -0.31, P = 0.002), indicative of improvement of depression symptoms. Qualitative analysis revealed similar results with respect to patient reports of negative feelings, including fear, guilt, and helplessness. Stigma and uncertainty of viral disease progression were two main concerns expressed by COVID-19 patients. Our results indicate that significant psychological distress was experienced by hospitalized COVID-19 patients and that levels of depressive features may be related to the inflammation markers in these patients. Thus, we recommend that necessary measures should be provided to address depression and other psychiatric symptoms for COVID-19 patients and attention should be paid to patient perceived stigma and coping strategies when delivering psychological interventions.","Guo, Qian; Zheng, Yuchen; Shi, Jia; Wang, Jijun; Li, Guanjun; Li, Chunbo; Fromson, John A; Xu, Yong; Liu, Xiaohua; Xu, Hua; Zhang, Tianhong; Lu, Yunfei; Chen, Xiaorong; Hu, Hao; Tang, Yingying; Yang, Shuwen; Zhou, Han; Wang, Xiaoliang; Chen, Haiying; Wang, Zhen; Yang, Zongguo",Brain Behav Immun,292,1

The shortfall, in this case for vertebrates, prevents accurate and rapid identification and monitoring of emerging pathogens and their reservoir host(s) and precludes extended investigation of ecological, evolutionary, and environmental associations that lead to human infection or spillover. Natural history museum biorepositories form the backbone of a critically needed, decentralized, global network for zoonotic pathogen surveillance, yet this infrastructure remains marginally developed, underutilized, underfunded, and disconnected from public health initiatives. Proactive detection and mitigation for emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) requires expanded biodiversity infrastructure and training (particularly in biodiverse and lower income countries) and new communication pipelines that connect biorepositories and biomedical communities. To this end, we highlight a novel adaptation of Project ECHO's virtual community of practice model: Museums and Emerging Pathogens in the Americas (MEPA). MEPA is a virtual network aimed at fostering communication, coordination, and collaborative problem-solving among pathogen researchers, public health officials, and biorepositories in the Americas. MEPA now acts as a model of effective international, interdisciplinary collaboration that can and should be replicated in other biodiversity hotspots. We encourage deposition of wildlife specimens and associated data with public biorepositories, regardless of original collection purpose, and urge biorepositories to embrace new specimen sources, types, and uses to maximize strategic growth and utility for EID research. Taxonomically, geographically, and temporally deep biorepository archives serve as the foundation of a proactive and increasingly predictive approach to zoonotic spillover, risk assessment, and threat mitigation.","Colella, Jocelyn P; Bates, John; Burneo, Santiago F; Camacho, M Alejandra; Carrion Bonilla, Carlos; Constable, Isabel; D039,; Elía, Guillermo; Dunnum, Jonathan L; Greiman, Stephen; Hoberg, Eric P; Lessa, Enrique; Liphardt, Schuyler W; Londoño-Gaviria, Manuela; Losos, Elizabeth; Lutz, Holly L; Ordóñez Garza, Nicté; Peterson, A Townsend; Martin, María Laura; Ribas, Camila C; Struminger, Bruce; Torres-Pérez, Fernando; Thompson, Cody W; Weksler, Marcelo; Cook, Joseph A",PLoS Pathog,292,6

Project Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (Project ECHO®) is an established hub-and-spoke tele-education model aimed at building capacity and expertise in primary care providers. Our qualitative study explored how learning experiences within an ECHO mental health care program supported provider learning and ability to solve complex clinical problems. METHODS: We sampled ECHO sessions across a 34-week cycle and analyzed audio transcribed data. Two individuals coded participant interactions during 2-hour recorded sessions using an iterative, constant comparative methodology. RESULTS: The authors identified four key mechanisms of learning in ECHO: (1) fostering participants' productive struggle with cases, (2) development of an integrated understanding, (3) collaborative reformulation of cases, and (4) generation of conceptual solutions based on a new understanding. Throughout the ECHO sessions, learning was observed to be multidirectional from both the hub-to-spoke and between spoke sites. DISCUSSION: Despite the widespread implementation of Project ECHO and other virtual learning models, a paucity of research has focused on mechanisms of virtual learning within these models. Our study demonstrated a bidirectional exchange of knowledge between hub specialist teams and primary care provider spokes that aligned with the development of adaptive expertise through specific learning experiences in Project ECHO. Moreover, the ECHO structure may further support the development of adaptive expertise to better prepare participants to address patients' complex mental health needs.","Sockalingam, Sanjeev; Rajaratnam, Thiyake; Zhou, Carrol; Serhal, Eva; Crawford, Allison; Mylopoulos, Maria",J Contin Educ Health Prof,292,20

The secondary objective was to assess predictors of 30-day case-fatality of VAP. From 15 February to 15 May 2020, 586 COVID-19 patients were admitted to the participating ICU. Of them, 171 developed VAP (29%) and were included in the study. The incidence rate of VAP was of 18 events per 1000 ventilator days (95% confidence intervals [CI] 16-21). Deep respiratory cultures were available and positive in 77/171 patients (45%). The most frequent organisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (27/77, 35%) and Staphylococcus aureus (18/77, 23%). The 30-day case-fatality of VAP was 46% (78/171).

The study aimed to prove that serum PCT, combining with other relevant variables, has an even better sepsis-detecting ability in critically ill patients. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study in a regional teaching hospital enrolling eligible patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU) between July 1, 2016, and December 31, 2016, and followed them until March 31, 2017. The primary outcome measurement was the occurrence of sepsis. We used multivariate logistic regression analysis to determine the independent factors for sepsis and constructed a novel PCT-based score containing these factors. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) was applied to evaluate sepsis-detecting abilities. Finally, we validated the score using a validation cohort. RESULTS: A total of 258 critically ill patients (70.9±16.3 years; 55.4% man) were enrolled in the derivation cohort and further subgrouped into the sepsis group (n = 115) and the non-sepsis group (n = 143). By using the multivariate logistic regression analysis, we disclosed five independent factors for detecting sepsis, namely, “serum PCT level,” “albumin level” and “neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio” at ICU admission, along with “diabetes mellitus,” and “with vasopressor.” We subsequently constructed a PCT-based score containing the five weighted factors. The PCT-based score performed well in detecting sepsis with the cut-points of 8 points (AUROC 0.80; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74–0.85; sensitivity 0.70; specificity 0.76), which was better than PCT alone, C-reactive protein and infection probability score. The findings were confirmed using an independent validation cohort (n = 72, 69.2±16.7 years, 62.5% men) (cut-point: 8 points; AUROC, 0.79; 95% CI 0.69–0.90; sensitivity 0.64; specificity 0.87).

The objectives of this study were to (1) evaluate the INSTI HIV self-test performance compared with laboratory reference testing, (2) document if intended users can perform the steps to use the HIV self-test device, and (3) document if intended users can successfully interpret contrived positive, negative, and invalid results. Study was intended to be submitted to Health Canada for review for regulatory approval purposes. METHODS: The study used a cross-sectional design and recruited consenting adults who were representative of intended users of HIV self-testing from four community sites across Ontario, Québec, and Manitoba between August 2019 and March 2020. The results of the observed HIV self-test were compared with results of the Abbott Architect HIV Ag/Ab Combo test. Usability outcomes for critical (e.g., lancing finger, blood droplet into bottle, shaking bottle four times) and noncritical self-test procedure steps were also determined. RESULTS: Overall, 77% (n = 522) of participants were between 18 and 45 years of age, 61% (n = 410) were male, 71% (n = 480) had some college or more education, and 45% (n = 307) were employed; identity for race and ethnicity: Caucasian (44%; n = 296), African, Caribbean or Black (17%; n = 113), Indigenous [First Nations, Métis or Inuit] (14%; n = 95), Asian (16%; n = 106), Latin American (7%; n = 46). Primary performance analysis on 678 completed HIV self-tests revealed a positive percent agreement of 100% (5/5, 95% CI: 43.6–97.0%) and a negative percent agreement of 99.5% (614/617, 95% CI: 98.6–99.8%) with the comparator method. The overall percent agreement of results interpretation between participant and observer was 93.5% (n = 633). For the 708 participants who took part in the usability study, the average success rate for steps determined to be “critical” for successful completion of the test was 92.4%. 97% (n = 670) of participants found the instructions easy to follow, and 95% (n = 655) of participants indicated that they would use the test again. Of the 404 participants who interpreted the strong positive, weak positive, negative, and invalid contrived results, successful interpretation ranged from 90.6% (for weak positive, n = 366) to 99.3% (for negative, n = 401). CONCLUSIONS: The addition of a regulatory-approved self-test into the Canadian HIV testing landscape could significantly increase HIV testing rates.

Binding of S protein to ACE2 causes internalization which activates local RAS. ACE2 is on the X chromosome and its expression is regulated by sex hormones. In this study, we defined ACE2 mRNA abundance and examined effects of S protein on ACE2 activity and/or angiotensin II (AngII) levels in pivotal tissues (lung, adipose) from male and female mice. In lung, ACE2 mRNA abundance was reduced following gonadectomy (GDX) of male and female mice and was higher in XX than XY mice of the Four Core Genotypes (FCG). Reductions in lung ACE2 mRNA abundance by GDX occurred in XX, but not XY FCG female mice. Lung mRNA abundance of ADAM17 and TMPRSS2, enzymes that shed cell surface ACE2 and facilitate viral cell entry, was reduced by GDX in male but not female mice. For comparison, adipose ACE2 mRNA abundance was higher in female than male mice and higher in XX than XY FCG mice. Adipose ADAM17 mRNA abundance was increased by GDX of male and female mice. S protein reduced ACE2 activity in alveolar type II epithelial cells and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Administration of S protein to male and female mice increased lung AngII levels and decreased adipose ACE2 activity in male but not female mice. These results demonstrate that sex differences in ACE2 expression levels may impact local RAS following S protein exposures.","Ensor, Charles M.; AlSiraj, Yasir; Shoemaker, Robin; Sturgill, Jamie; Keshavamurthy, Suresh; Gordon, Elizabeth M.; Dong, Brittany E.; Waters, Christopher; Cassis, Lisa A",bioRxiv,292,20

Even though both paradigms are supposed to examine the same phenomenon of Automatic Effect of Instructions (AEI), there are some meaningful differences between them, notably in the size of the AEI. In the current work, we examined, in two pre-registered studies, the potential reasons for these differences in AEI size. Study 1 examined the influence of the data-analytic approach by comparing two existing relatively large data-sets, one from each paradigm (Braem et al., in Mem Cogn 47:1582–1591, 2019; Meiran et al., in Neuropsychologia 90:180–189, 2016). Study 2 focused on the influence of instruction type (concrete, as in NEXT, and abstract, as in I-D) and choice complexity of the task in which AEI-interference is assessed. We did that while using variants of the NEXT paradigm, some with modifications that approximated it to the I-D paradigm. Results from Study 1 indicate that the data-analytic approach partially explains the differences between the paradigms in terms of AEI size. Still, the paradigms remained different with respect to individual differences and with respect to AEI size in the first step following the instructions. Results from Study 2 indicate that Instruction type and the choice complexity in the phase in which AEI is assessed do not influence AEI size, or at least not in the expected direction.

Geriatric problems, such as frailty, physical and psychological limitations should be recorded as well as the social situation, as all these factors are of prognostic importance. Pneumonia acquired in a nursing home or by people in need of long-term care has a less favorable prognosis. Although this type of pneumonia is considered to be community acquired, special attenion is required.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of the use of two types of PPE on quality of vision during gastrointestinal endoscopy. METHODS: A cross-sectional observational pilot study in gastroenterologists who undergo an ophthalmological examination of visual acuity and quality of vision when using two types of PPE. Type #1: 3M N95 1860 green respirator + 3M mono safety glasses + protective screen. Type #2: 3M 6800 full facepiece + 3M NIOSH 7093C HF/P100 filters. RESULTS: Visual acuity and quality of vison parameters while using the PPE that is routinely used when performing gastrointestinal endoscopy during the pandemic were evaluated. It was found that Modality #1 was associated with decreases of up to 37% in visual acuity, 25% in colour visualisation and 75% in contrast sensitivity among digestive endoscopists within minutes of placement. These figures worsened over the course of the procedure, rising to 75%, 60% and 100%, respectively. Modality #2 was not associated with any deterioration in quality of vision.

Although population immunity is typically estimated by the serological investigation of recovered patients, humoral immunity in asymptomatic subjects has not been well studied, although they represent a large proportion of all SARS-CoV-2 infection cases. In this study, we conducted a serosurvey of asymptomatic infections among food workers and performed serological and cellular response analyses of asymptomatic subjects in Wuhan, the original epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak. Our data showed that up to 5.91% of the food workers carried SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies asymptomatically; however, in 90.4% of them, the antibody level declined over a 2-week period. IgM and IgG antibodies, including neutralizing antibodies, were significantly lower in asymptomatic subjects than in recovered symptomatic patients with similar disease courses. Furthermore, the asymptomatic subjects showed lymphopenia and a prominent decrease in the B-cell population, as well as a low frequency of antibody-secreting cells and a low cytokine response. These factors probably contributed to the low and unsustained antibody levels in asymptomatic subjects. Our results show that asymptomatic subjects are likely to be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 reinfection, and neither the proportion of population immunity nor the breadth of immune responses is sufficient for herd immunity.","Yang, Yong; Wang, Xi; Du, Rong-Hui; Zhang, Wei; Si, Hao-Rui; Zhu, Yan; Shen, Xu-Rui; Li, Qian; Li, Bei; Men, Dong; Zhou, Ya-na; Wang, Hui; Tong, Xiao-lin; Zhang, Xian-en; Shi, Zheng-Li; Zhou, Peng",Emerging microbes & infections,292,13

The papain-like protease (PLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is essential for viral proliferation. In addition, PLpro dysregulates the host immune response by cleaving ubiquitin and interferon-stimulated gene 15 protein (ISG15) from host proteins. As a result, PLpro is a promising target for inhibition by small-molecule therapeutics. Here we have designed a series of covalent inhibitors by introducing a peptidomimetic linker and reactive electrophilic “warheads” onto analogs of the noncovalent PLpro inhibitor GRL0617. We show that the most promising PLpro inhibitor is potent and selective, with activity in cell-based antiviral assays rivaling that of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor remdesivir. An X-ray crystal structure of the most promising lead compound bound covalently to PLpro establishes the molecular basis for protease inhibition and selectivity against structurally similar human deubiquitinases. These findings present an opportunity for further development of potent and selective covalent PLpro inhibitors.","Sanders, Brian; Pohkrel, Suman; Labbe, Audrey; Mathews, Irimpan; Cooper, Connor; Davidson, Russell; Phillips, Gwyndalyn; Weiss, Kevin; Zhang, Qiu; O’Neill, Hugh; Kaur, Manat; Ferrins, Lori; Schmidt, Jurgen; Reichard, Walter; Surendranathan, Surekha; Kumaran, Desigan; Andi, Babak; Babnigg, Gyorgy; Moriarty, Nigel; Adams, Paul; Joachimiak, Andrzej; Jonsson, Colleen; Wakatsuki, Soichi; Galanie, Stephanie; Head, Martha; Parks, Jerry",Res Sq,292,21

For the mean-field model, which does not distinguish between different age groups, we demonstrate that including a more realistic Gamma distribution of incubation and recovery periods may not have an effect on the total number of deaths and the overall size of an epidemic, but it has a major effect in terms of increasing the peak numbers of infected and critical care cases, as well as on changing the timescales of an epidemic, both in terms of time to reach the peak, and the overall duration of an outbreak. In order to obtain more accurate estimates of disease progression and investigate different strategies for introducing and lifting the lockdown, we have also considered an age-structured version of the model, which has allowed us to include more accurate data on age-specific rates of hospitalisation and COVID-19 related mortality. Applying this model to three comparable neighbouring regions in the UK has delivered some fascinating insights regarding the effect of lockdown in regions with different population structure. We have discovered that for a fixed lockdown duration, the timing of its start is very important in the sense that the second epidemic wave after lifting the lockdown can be significantly smaller or larger depending on the specific population structure. Also, the later the fixed-duration lockdown is introduced, the smaller is the resulting final number of deaths at the end of the outbreak. When the lockdown is introduced simultaneously for all regions, increasing lockdown duration postpones and slightly reduces the epidemic peak, though without noticeable differences in peak magnitude between different lockdown durations.","Blyuss, K.B.; Kyrychko, Y.N.",J Theor Biol,292,17

The Korean government aimed to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 through stay-at-home strategies and maintaining social distance, which are likely to result in major changes in the lifestyle, mental health, and quality of life of citizens. This study aimed to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on these factors in Koreans over 20 years old. METHODS: The study sample consisted of 104 adults in South Korea aged over 20 years. An online survey was conducted between August and October 2020, in which participants were asked to complete the Yonsei Lifestyle Profile to assess lifestyle changes, the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale, and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale abbreviated version. To investigate the changes in people’s lifestyles, depression, and quality of life post COVID-19, descriptive statistics were calculated for these indicators before and after the onset of the pandemic. The p-value was two-sided, and values <0.05, were regarded as statistically significant. RESULTS: There was a significant decline in physical and other meaningful activities, including activities of daily living, leisure, social activity, and education. However, there were no significant changes in nutrition, except in the consumption of carbohydrates and minerals. Participants reported that their quality of life and mental health had decreased after the pandemic struck.

Beef and dairy cattle are considered the most important animal reservoirs for this pathogen. One of the important virulence characteristics of E. coli O157:H7 is the eaeA gene encoding the 97 kDa surface protein intimin. Intimin is required for attachment and effacement during the interaction of enterohemorrhagic E. coli with human and bovine neonatal enterocytes. The present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that an adaptive mucosal immune response directed against intimin will reduce or prevent enteric colonization and fecal shedding of E. coli O157:H7 in cattle. RESULTS: Cattle were orally inoculated with either milk (control), milk with live attenuated Salmonella enterica serovar Dublin (vector), or milk with live attenuated recombinant S. Dublin expressing intimin (vaccinated) on days 0, 14 and 28. On day 98, all calves were challenged orally with E. coli O157:H7 to evaluate whether vaccination with the recombinant S. Dublin expressing intimin would reduce the level of E. coli O157:H7 fecal shedding. During the first 28 days, vaccinated calves shed both the vector strain and the intimin-expressing S. Dublin strain at a similar level. The vector strain was shed for a significantly longer period as compared to the level of recombinant vaccine strain. Calves that received the intimin-expressed vaccine ceased shedding S. Dublin from day 28 to day 63. All calves were challenged with E. coli O157:H7 on day 98 to determine the effect on fecal shedding of E. coli O157:H7. The amount of E. coli O157:H7 in feces was measured for 30 days post-challenge. We observed a transient clearance of E. coli O157:H7 from the feces in the vaccinated calves. The magnitude of fecal E. coli O157:H7 shedding did not correlate with the presence of intimin-specific fecal IgA. CONCLUSION: Oral vaccination with live attenuated recombinant S. Dublin expressing intimin reduced enteric colonization and fecal shedding of E. coli O157:H7. However, the transient clearance of E. coli O157:H7 was not associated with an enhanced IgA-mediated mucosal immune response.","Khare, Sangeeta; Alali, Walid; Zhang, Shuping; Hunter, Doris; Pugh, Roberta; Fang, Ferric C; Libby, Stephen J; Adams, L Garry",BMC Vet Res,292,24

Questions assessed: (a) trauma indictors (past diagnosis, current symptoms, and lifetime exposure to events); (b) vaccine measures (intentions for self and child, COVID-19 vaccine confidence, general vaccine perceived safety, reasoning about vaccine intentions, sources of influence on intentions); and (c) possible explanatory variables (institutional distrust, negative worldviews). ANCOVAs and regression analyses were used. RESULTS: When compared with mothers with other mental health diagnoses, mothers with a PTSD history had significantly less confidence in the COVID-19 vaccine and less intent to get the vaccine for themselves or their child. These effects were explained by greater institutional distrust (i.e., significant indirect effects). Mothers with a previous PTSD diagnosis also expressed different reasons for vaccine hesitancy (e.g., less belief in science) and ascribed less influence to healthcare and governmental sources in vaccine decision-making. CONCLUSION: Findings highlight the potential utility of a trauma-informed approach in efforts to reduce COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. For mothers with a history of PTSD, addressing institutional distrust, including towards the healthcare industry, may be an important element to consider in the content, delivery, and mode of vaccine messaging.","Milan, Stephanie; Dáu, Ana Luísa B T",J Pediatr Psychol,292,28

However, there has been a lack of published literature, especially using the EMR records, that provides a comparative summary of the prognostic factors present in the coronavirus-derived diseases patients. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to compare and evaluate the distinct clinical traits between the patients of different coronaviruses, including the lesser pathogenic HCoV strains, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. We also conducted observed the risk factors by the COVID severity to investigate the extent of resemblance in clinical features between the disease groups and to identify unique factor that may influence the prognosis of the COVID-19 patients. Here, we utilize the common data model (CDM), which is the database that houses the EMR records transformed into the common format to be used by the multiple institutions. For the comparative analyses between the disease groups, we used independent t-test, Scheffe post-hoc test, and Games-howell post-hoc test and for the continuous variables, chi-square test and Fisher exact test. Based on the analyses, we selected the variables with p-values less than 0.05 to predict COVID-19 severity by nominal logistic regression with adjustments to age and gender. From the study, we observed diabetes, cardio and cerebrovascular diseases, cancer, pulmonary disease, gastrointestinal disease, and renal disease in all patient groups. Of all, the proportions of cancer patients were highest in all groups with no statistical significance. Most interestingly, we observed a high degree of clinical similarity between the COVID-19 and SARS patients with more than 50% of measured clinical variables to show statistical similarities between two groups. Our research reflects the great significance within the bioinformatics field that we were able to effectively utilize the integrated CDM to reflect real-world challenges in the context of coronavirus. We expect the results from our study to provide clinical insights that can serve as predicator of risk factors from the future coronavirus outbreak as well as the prospective guidelines for the clinical treatments.","Kim, Y.

Herein, we aim to evaluate the prognostic value of SOFA, qSOFA and mSOFA scores on the need of mechanical ventilation and outcome. We also hope to use the scoring system to better classify the different stages of disease in relation with the serology (IgM/IgG). METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of patients with COVID-19 admitted to our hospital between 10/1/2020 to 2/28/2021. Inclusion criteria was a well defined clinical outcome i.e., survived or expired and available serology. Demographics, and lab data were reviewed. Simple t-test was used for continuous variables and chi-square test was used for categorical variables. Univariate analysis was used to identify the potential predictive value of SOFA, qSOFA and mSOFA for the need of mechanical ventilation and outcome. GraphPad PRISM was used for all analysis. RESULTS: A total of 202 patients were included during the study period. Majority were latinx and black. Diabetes and hypertension were the most common comorbidities. High SOFA, qSOFA and mSOFA score were significantly associated with risk of mechanical ventilation (Log-likelihood ratio of 31.15, 11.24 and 42.45 respectively with p-value of <0.0001, 0.008 and <0.0001 respectively) and in-patient mortality (Log-likelihood ratio of 35.92, 7.12 and 47.42 respectively with p-value of <0.0001, 0.0076 and <0.0001 respectively). When comparing these scoring systems, mSOFA was better in mechanical ventilation prediction (AUC 0.8483) and mortality prediction (AUC 0.8882) as compared to SOFA and qSOFA. We further classified the patients into different stages of disease based on serology to determine a difference in the scoring system. 47 patients were classified into pre-cytokine storm stage with both IgM and IgG negative;116 patients into cytokine storm stage with IgM positive and 39 patients in post-cytokine storm stages with IgM negative and IgG positive. When comparing scores with different stages of the disease, patients in the pre-cytokine storm stage exhibited significantly higher scores. The significantly higher score in the pre-cytokine storm stage may help to predict the need of mechanical ventilation and mortality in this subgroup. Studies with larger sample size are required to evaluate the correlation between higher scores in the pre-cytokine storm stage with the need of mechanical ventilation and in-patient mortality. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlighted the role of SOFA, qSOFA and mSOFA scores to predict the need of mechanical ventilation and in-patient mortality. Larger prospective studies will be required to correlate these findings. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The study shows the use of mSOFA and SOFA scores at admission on predicting the use of mechanical ventilation and outcome in different stage of the disease.

To address the need to assess progress, a sequential mixed methodology with an explanatory research design was employed. In Phase 1, a self-administered questionnaire was completed by healthcare professionals (HCPs) from 26 public sector healthcare facilities across South Africa to assess compliance with the Framework. The results were explored in Phase 2 through 10 focus group discussions and two in-depth interviews, including 83 participants. Emerging themes indicated that public healthcare facilities across South Africa are facing many challenges, especially at entry level primary healthcare (PHC) facilities, where antimicrobial stewardship activities and ASPs are not yet fully implemented. Improved diagnostics and surveillance data are a major shortcoming at these facilities. Continuous education for HCPs is deficient, especially for the majority of prescribers at PHC level and health campaigns are nearly non-existent. Involvement and visibility of management at certain facilities is a serious shortfall. Consequently, it is important to call attention to the challenges faced with improving antimicrobial prescribing across countries and address these to reduce AMR, especially in PHC facilities, being the first point of access to healthcare for the vast majority of patients in developing countries.","Engler, Deirdré; Meyer, Johanna Catharina; Schellack, Natalie; Kurdi, Amanj; Godman, Brian",Antibiotics (Basel),292,1

NETs can be formed NADPH oxidase (NOX)-dependently or NOX-independently. NOX-independent NETs can be induced by activated platelets and are very potent in activating the endothelium. Platelet activation with thrombocytopenia and endothelial dysfunction are prominent features of dengue virus infection. We postulated that dengue infection is associated with NOX-independent NET formation, which is related to platelet activation, endothelial perturbation and increased vascular permeability. Using our specific NET assays, we investigated the time course of NET formation in a cohort of Indonesian dengue patients. We found that plasma levels of NETs were profoundly elevated and that these NETs were predominantly NOX-independent NETs. During early recovery phase (7-13 days from fever onset), total NETs correlated negatively with platelet number and positively with platelet P-selectin expression, the binding of von Willebrand factor to platelets and levels of Syndecan-1. Patients with gall bladder wall thickening, an early marker of plasma leakage, had a higher median level of total NETs. Ex vivo, platelets induced NOX-independent NET formation in a dengue virus non-structural protein 1 (NS1)-dependent manner. We conclude that NOX-independent NET formation is enhanced in dengue, which is most likely mediated by NS1 and activated platelets.","Garishah, Fadel Muhammad; Rother, Nils; Riswari, Silvita Fitri; Alisjahbana, Bachti; Overheul, Gijs J.; van Rij, Ronald P.; van der Ven, André; van der Vlag, Johan; de Mast, Quirijn",Front Immunol,292,1

As a result of these shortages, many health care providers have temporarily used largely untested, improvised PPE (iPPE). Lack of quality control for makeshift PPE and frequent repurposing of used items to conserve supplies increase both the risk of provider infection and nosocomial spread to uninfected patients. One strategy to reduce risk of infection and preserve existing equipment is the implementation of secondary barrier devices placed directly over patients or providers. The authors describe an inexpensive, disposable, positive-pressure head isolation unit that can be rapidly constructed from materials readily available in nearly all health care settings for under five US dollars. The unit was successfully deployed in Taiwan during the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak, and again during the COVID-19 pandemic. The iPPE worn directly by the health care workers (HCWs) can be donned prior to patient contact in the presence of an air source. This strategy may be more protective than a covering placed over the patient in an aerosol-generating environment, which requires the HCW to be in close contact with the patient prior to securing the protective device.","Chien, Li-Chien; Beÿ, Christian K.; Koenig, Kristi L.",Prehospital and disaster medicine,292,24

In this context, a large body of scientific literature examining the mental health impact of this global crisis has emerged. The majority of these studies have framed this impact in terms of pre-defined categories derived from psychiatric nosology, such as anxiety disorders, depression or post-traumatic stress disorder. These constructs often fail to capture the complexity of the actual experiences of the individuals being studied; more specifically, they describe these experiences exclusively in terms of disease, while neglecting their potentially adaptive or “salutogenic” aspects. Similarly, discussion of psychological assistance for these individuals has largely been confined to a reiteration of “evidence-based” psychological or pharmacological techniques which can be delivered using remote access technology. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, these approaches are likely to be of mixed efficacy. Conversely, “negative emotions” or distressing psychological experiences may actually be functional in the setting of a disaster or crisis, serving to minimize harm, maximize social coherence and compliance, and facilitate adherence to safety measures. The limitations of the “conventional” approach are, to a certain degree, inherent to the prevailing medical model of mental health. Beyond these considerations lies the concept of “salutogenesis,” a term which refers to the innate capacity of individuals to create and maintain health and well-being in the face of adversity. Using principles derived from the second wave of positive psychology (PP2.0), particularly its emphasis on the totality of human experience and the possibility of deriving meaning and character growth from suffering, this paper conceptually analyses the relevant aspects of salutogenesis and PP2.0, and proposes an alternate approach for addressing mental health concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic. Such an approach, while acknowledging the utility of the conventional medical-psychotherapeutic model in specific cases, reduces the risk of medicalizing human experience, and provides individuals and communities with opportunities for growth and adaptation. The benefits of this proposal could potentially extend far beyond the current crisis, offering an opportunity for the field of psychiatry and mental health research to move away from a purely “disease-centered” model.","Rajkumar, Ravi Philip",Front Psychol,292,21

Methods From Dec 31, 2019, to Apr 5, 2020, a total of 132 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients with diabetes from two hospitals were retrospectively included in our study. Clinical, laboratory and chest CT data were analyzed and compared between the two groups with an admission glucose level of ≤11mmol/L (group 1) and >11mmol/L (group 2). Logistic regression analyses were used to identify the risk factors associated with in-hospital death and complications. Results Of 132 patients, 15 died in hospital and 113 were discharged. Patients in group 2 were more likely to require intensive care unit care (21.4% vs. 9.2%), to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (23.2% vs. 9.25%) and acute cardiac injury (12.5% vs. 1.3%), and had a higher death rate (19.6% vs. 5.3%) than group 1. In the multivariable analysis, patients with admission glucose of >11 mmol/l had an increased risk of death (OR: 7.629, 95%CI: 1.391-37.984) and in-hospital complications (OR: 3.232, 95%CI: 1.393-7.498).

Human IFIT1 binds to cap0 (m7GpppN) RNA, which lacks methylation on the first and second cap-proximal nucleotides (cap1, m7GpppNm, and cap2, m7GpppNmNm, respectively). These modifications are signatures of “self” in higher eukaryotes, whereas unmodified cap0-RNA is recognized as foreign and, therefore, potentially harmful to the host cell. IFIT1 inhibits translation at the initiation stage by competing with the cap-binding initiation factor complex, eIF4F, restricting infection by certain viruses that possess “nonself” cap0-mRNAs. However, in mice and other rodents, the IFIT1 orthologue has been lost, and the closely related Ifit1b has been duplicated twice, yielding three paralogues: Ifit1, Ifit1b, and Ifit1c. Although murine Ifit1 is similar to human IFIT1 in its cap0-RNA–binding selectivity, the roles of Ifit1b and Ifit1c are unknown. Here, we found that Ifit1b preferentially binds to cap1-RNA, whereas binding is much weaker to cap0- and cap2-RNA. In murine cells, we show that Ifit1b can modulate host translation and restrict WT mouse coronavirus infection. We found that Ifit1c acts as a stimulatory cofactor for both Ifit1 and Ifit1b, promoting their translation inhibition. In this way, Ifit1c acts in an analogous fashion to human IFIT3, which is a cofactor to human IFIT1. This work clarifies similarities and differences between the human and murine IFIT families to facilitate better design and interpretation of mouse models of human infection and sheds light on the evolutionary plasticity of the IFIT family.","Mears, Harriet V.; Sweeney, Trevor R.",J Biol Chem,292,17

Although the mortality rate of this virus is low, it is especially potent against people with underlying systemic conditions. Dentistry is a profession where the doctor, as well as the dental staff, works in close vicinity to the patient’s mouth. Dental education has two core components; didactic and clinical training (including patient care). Dental education has been interrupted in the past due to certain events (Arab Spring and SARS outbreak). Currently, the pandemic of COVID-19 has disrupted dental education globally as most of the dental schools and universities in the world have closed amidst the COVID-19 outbreak. Teledentistry is a subspecialty of telemedicine that helps in the provision of educational activities, advice, and diagnosis about treatment over a distance with the help of technology like video conferencing. The current overview summarizes the potential role of teledentistry in continuing the dental educational process in terms of delivery of didactic components, clinical training, and patient care. It can be concluded that with modern updated devices and tools, teledentistry can be an effective way to prevent disruption of dental education and it can be utilized in continuing the dental educational process in this critical time of the COVID-19 outbreak.","Farooq, Imran; Ali, Saqib; Moheet, Imran Alam; AlHumaid, Jehan",Pak J Med Sci,292,20

This study aimed to develop a laboratory score system to identify high-risk individuals, to validate this score in a separate cohort, and to test its accuracy in the prediction of in-hospital mortality. METHODS: In this cohort study, biological data from 330 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were used to develop a risk score to predict progression toward severity. In a second stage, data from 240 additional COVID-19 patients were used to validate this score. Accuracy of the score was measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). RESULTS: In the development cohort, a step-wise decrease in the average survival duration was noted with the increment of the risk score (p(ANOVA) < 0.0001). A similar trend was confirmed when analyzing this association in the validation cohort (p < 0.0001). The AUC was 0.74 [0.66–0.82] and 0.90 [0.87–0.94], p < 0.0001, respectively for severity and mortality prediction. CONCLUSION: This study provides a useful risk score based on biological routine parameters assessed at the time of admission, which has proven its effectiveness in predicting both severity and short-term mortality of COVID-19. Improved predictive scores may be generated by including other clinical and radiological features.","Bennouar, Salam; Bachir Cherif, Abdelghani; Kessira, Amel; Bennouar, Djamel-Eddine; Abdi, Samia",Intensive Crit Care Nurs,292,3

We quantified the spatial and angular changes in the structure using two independent analyses, one based on a spatial metrics (δ, ratio), the second on angular metrics. The order of unfolding of the 10 helices in Mpro is characterized by beta vs alpha plots similar to those of cytochromes and globins. The longest turning region is anomalous in the earliest stage of unfolding. In an investigation of excluded-volume effects, we found that the maximum spread in average molecular-volume values for Mpro, cytochrome c-b(562), cytochrome c’, myoglobin, and cytoglobin is ~10 Å(3). This apparent universality is a consequence dominant contributions from six residues: ALA, ASP, GLU, LEU, LYS and VAL. Of the seven Mpro histidines, residues 41, 163, 164, and 246 are in stable H-bonded regions; metal ion binding to one or more of these residues could break up the H-bond network, thereby affecting protease function.

We determined the prevalence of COVID-19 vaccination intention (VI) and fear of its adverse effects (FAE) as well as their associated factors in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). METHODS: We conducted a secondary cross-sectional analysis of a database collected by the University of Maryland and Facebook. We included participants aged 18 and over from LAC surveyed, January 15 to February 1, 2021. We evaluated VI, FAE, sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-19 symptomatology, compliance with community mitigation strategies, food and economic insecurity, mental health evaluation and the influence in VI when recommended by different stakeholders. We calculated crude and adjusted prevalence ratios with their 95%CIs. RESULTS: We analyzed 472,521 responses by Latin American adults, finding a VI and FAE prevalence of 80.0% and 81.2%, respectively. We found that female and non-binary genders were associated with a lower probability of VI and a higher probability of FAE. Besides, living in a town, village or rural area and economic insecurity was associated with a higher FAE probability. The fears of becoming seriously ill, a family member becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 and having depressive symptoms were associated with a higher probability of VI and FAE. CONCLUSION: Eight out of 10 adults in LAC have VI and FAE. The factors identified are useful for the development of communication strategies to reduce FAE frequency.

Design: Ecological retrospective study for the period March-July 2020. Setting: Population-based investigation, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. Participants: All COVID-19 cases, adjusted for zip code area population, in the early period of the pandemic. Main Outcome Measures: Monthly COVID-19 incidence and requests for human services by zip code level indicators of race-ethnicity and poverty. Results: In the early period of the pandemic, COVID-19 incidence was higher in zip codes with a greater proportion of racial and ethnic minorities. Zip codes with the highest quartile of minority residents (>25.1% of population) had a COVID-19 incidence of 60.1 (95% CI: 51.7-68.5) per 10,000 in this period; zip codes with the lowest quartile of minority residents (<6.3%) had an incidence of 31.3 (95% CI: 14.4-48.2).

The conformationally dynamic S-protein is the primary immunogenic target of vaccine design owing to its role in host-cell fusion, displaying multiple receptor binding domain (RBD) ‘up’ and ‘down’ state configurations. Here, we investigated the potential for RBD adjacent, N-terminal domain (NTD) glycans to influence the conformational equilibrium of these RBD states. Using a combination of antigenic screens and high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination, we show that an N-glycan deletion at position 234 results in a dramatically reduced population of the ‘up’ state RBD position. Conversely, glycan deletion at position N165 results in a discernable increase in ‘up’ state RBDs. This indicates the glycan shield acts not only as a passive hinderance to antibody meditated immunity but also as a conformational control element. Together, our results demonstrate this highly dynamic conformational machine is responsive to glycan modification with implications in viral escape and vaccine design.","Henderson, Rory; Edwards, Robert J; Mansouri, Katayoun; Janowska, Katarzyna; Stalls, Victoria; Kopp, Megan; Haynes, Barton F.; Acharya, Priyamvada",bioRxiv,292,16

Because many infectious diseases spread through close contacts, contact tracing is a key tool for case discovery and control. However, although contact tracing has been performed widely, the mathematical understanding of contact tracing has not been fully established and it has not been clearly understood what determines the efficacy of contact tracing. Here, we reveal that, compared with""forward""tracing---tracing to whom disease spreads,""backward""tracing---tracing from whom disease spreads---is profoundly more effective. The effectiveness of backward tracing is due to simple but overlooked biases arising from the heterogeneity in contacts. Using simulations on both synthetic and high-resolution empirical contact datasets, we show that even at a small probability of detecting infected individuals, strategically executed contact tracing can prevent a significant fraction of further transmissions. We also show that---in terms of the number of prevented transmissions per isolation---case isolation combined with a small amount of contact tracing is more efficient than case isolation alone. By demonstrating that backward contact tracing is highly effective at discovering super-spreading events, we argue that the potential effectiveness of contact tracing has been underestimated. Therefore, there is a critical need for revisiting current contact tracing strategies so that they leverage all forms of biases. Our results also have important consequences for digital contact tracing because it will be crucial to incorporate the capability for backward and deep tracing while adhering to the privacy-preserving requirements of these new platforms.","Kojaku, Sadamori; H'ebert-Dufresne, Laurent; Mones, Enys; Lehmann, Sune; Ahn, Yong-Yeol",Nature physics,292,22

It has since been recognized as a pandemic and has led to great social and economic disruption globally. The Reverse Transcriptase Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (rtRT-PCR) has become the primary method for COVID-19 testing worldwide. The method requires a specialized laboratory set up. Long-term persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal secretion after full clinical recovery of the patient is regularly observed nowadays. This forces the patients to spend a longer period in isolation and test repeatedly to obtain evidence of viral clearance. Repeated COVID-19 testing in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases often leads to extra workload for laboratories that are already struggling with a high specimen turnover. Here, we present 5 purposively selected cases with different patterns of clinical presentations in which nasopharyngeal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was observed in patients for a long time. From these case studies, we emphasized the adoption of a symptom-based approach for discontinuing transmission-based precautions over a test-based strategy to reduce the time spent by asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients in isolation. A symptom-based approach will also help reduce laboratory burden for COVID-19 testing as well as conserve valuable resources and supplies utilized for rtRT-PCR testing in an emerging lower-middle-income setting. Most importantly, it will also make room for critically ill COVID-19 patients to visit or avail COVID-19 testing at their convenience.","Islam, S. M. Rashed Ul; Akther, Tahmina; Nasif, Md.

METHODS: We retrospectively studied patients admitted to an academic-level ED in France who were undergoing a joint measurement of SpO(2) and arterial blood gas. We compared SpO(2) with SaO(2) and evaluated performance of the SpO(2)/FiO(2) ratio for the prediction of 300 and 400 mmHg PaO(2)/FiO(2) cut-off values in COVID-19 positive and negative subgroups using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: During the study period from February to April 2020, a total of 430 arterial samples were analyzed and collected from 395 patients.

The COVID-19 outbreak only increased the urgent demand for an affordable, safe and effective treatment for this process. Early clinical trials suggest the therapeutic usefulness of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in acute lung injury (ALI) and ARDS. MSC-based therapies show antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, regenerative, angiogenic, antifibrotic, anti-oxidative stress and anti-apoptotic actions, which can thwart the physiopathological mechanisms engaged in ARDS.

We seek to determine the ability of emergency medicine residents and attending physicians in accredited emergency medicine residency training programs to inflate an endotracheal tube cuff to appropriate pressure using standard syringe technique and assess appropriateness of pressure of previously inflated endotracheal tube cuffs by palpating the pilot balloon. Methods: This institutional review board–approved descriptive survey of resident and attending physicians in accredited emergency medicine residency training programs in New York City used a previously tested, tracheal simulation model with a 7.5-mm endotracheal tube with a high-volume low-pressure cuff (Mallinkrodt, St. Louis, MO). Using their choice of a 5-mL or 10-mL plastic syringe with standard Luer Lock (Beckton-Dickson, Franklin Lakes, NJ), participants inflated the endotracheal tube cuff by standard method of injecting air as they deemed appropriate in conjunction with palpating the pilot balloon to estimate cuff pressure. Subsequently, the endotracheal tube cuff pressure was measured using a highly sensitive and accurate analog manometer (Boehringer Laboratories, Norristown, PA). Later, participants palpated the pilot balloon of 9 endotracheal tubes with cuffs previously inflated to known pressures ranging from 0 to 120 cm H2O and reported whether the pressure was low, appropriate, or high. Results: Twenty-five resident physicians and 42 attending physicians from 5 emergency medicine residency training programs were surveyed. Only 0.4% (n=3) of participants inflated the cuff to a safe pressure; all were attending physicians. The average cuff pressure generated by emergency medicine attending physicians was greater than 98 cm H2O (attending physicians >93 cm H2O, residents >106 cm H2O). The true mean could not be determined because 57% (n=38) inflated to pressures greater than the upper limit of manometer sensitivity (>120 cm H2O). Using palpation, participants were only 33% sensitive detecting inappropriately inflated endotracheal tube cuffs (attending physicians 22% sensitive, residents 53% sensitive), and they were only 26% sensitive in detecting overinflated endotracheal tube cuffs (attending physicians 22%, residents 33%). Average experience as an attending emergency physician was 9 years; average experience as a resident was 2.1 years. Conclusion: This group of emergency physicians had little ability to inflate an endotracheal tube cuff to safe pressure, little ability to accurately estimate pressure of a previously inflated cuff using standard technique, and minimal ability to detect overinflated endotracheal tube cuffs. Nearly all inflated the cuff to dangerously high pressures. Clinicians should consider using devices that permit safe and accurate inflation and measurement of endotracheal tube cuff pressure rather than relying on standard palpation technique, which is potentially unsafe and highly inaccurate.","Hoffman, R.

Effective self-management of health requires appropriate knowledge, skills and confidence. Digital health interventions are potentially appealing tools to improve knowledge and self-management behaviours, as well as actively involving individuals in their healthcare, particularly in the post-COVID-19 era. However, the development strategies and processes behind such interventions are poorly defined. Here we describe the systematic development of a digital self-management programme for people living with non-dialysis CKD which includes novel approaches to improving self-management and health behaviours. METHOD: Intervention mapping (IM) was used to guide the development of a digital self-management programme called ‘My Kidneys and Me’ (MK&M) to ensure that it can be implemented in clinical practice. The development process was guided by the first four steps of IM: (1) establish multidisciplinary and patient and public involvement (PPI) steering groups to describe the context of the intervention and programme goals; (2) identify objectives and determinants at early design stages to maintain a focus on the strategies adopted; (3) generate the programme components underpinned by appropriate psychological theories and models; (4) develop the programme content and describe the iterative process of refining the content and format of the digital programme for evaluation and implementation. The last two steps (adoption, implementation, and evaluation plan) will be evaluated alongside a forthcoming trial. RESULTS: A multidisciplinary steering group was formed consisting of 23 healthcare professionals, researchers, and digital health experts who provided expertise in the clinical and psychosocial aspects of CKD, self-management, digital health, and behaviour change research. A PPI steering group of 12 patients and family members identified the needs and priorities of MK&M, providing feedback at relevant time points. As a result of previous literature and input from both steering groups, MK&M was developed with the aim to improve and maintain self-management behaviours, including to improve knowledge, promote self-care skill, increase self-efficacy, improve well-being, and increase physical activity. These target behaviours were translated into key programme goals: 1) increase patient activation; 2) reduce health risks; 3) manage symptoms; and 4) increase physical function. Based on patient input and needs, MK&M was designed to comprise educational (Learn about …) and behaviour change (How to …) sessions, health trackers (e.g. blood pressure, weight, fruit and veg consumption), symptom tracker, exercise trackers, goal setting features, and social support. For example, to improve symptom management behaviours, patients can use MK&M to: 1) learn about symptoms associated with CKD and strategies to help manage these symptoms; 2) learn how to recognise and keep track of their symptoms so that they can modify their lifestyle accordingly and speak to their healthcare professional if needed; 3) track their symptoms using a bespoke tool. CONCLUSION: Applying the IM framework enabled us to systematically use theory, empirical evidence, and practical perspectives in the development of MK&M. Our evidence- and theory-based online self-management programme provides ongoing support and guidance to people with CKD. The efficacy of MK&M to improve patient self-management behaviour is being studied in a multi-site RCT in the UK.","Lightfoot, Courtney J; Wilkinson, Thomas; Smith, Alice",Nephrol Dial Transplant,292,16

Resveratrol (RSV) has been used as a preclinical drug for the treatment of the metabolic disorders. However, the impact of RSV on HBV replication remains unknown. In this study, the HBV-expressing hepatocelluar carcinoma cell line and mouse model created by hydrodynamic injection of viral DNA were used. We found that RSV activates Sirt1, which in turn deacetylates PGC-1α and subsequently increases the transcriptional activity of PPARα, leading to the enhanced HBV transcription and replication in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we found that this pathway is also required for fasting-induced HBV transcription. Taken together, this study identifies that RSV enhances HBV transcription and replication especially acting on the core promoter, which depends on Sirt1-PGC-1α-PPARα pathway. We conclude that RSV may exacerbate the progression of hepatitis B and that patients with hepatitis B infection should be cautious taking RSV as a dietary supplement.","Shi, Yixian; Li, Yongjun; Huang, Chenjie; Ying, Lixiong; Xue, Jihua; Wu, Haicong; Chen, Zhi; Yang, Zhenggang",Sci Rep,292,6

Testing capacity must be sufficient during the winter respiratory season when levels of cough and fever are high due to non-COVID-19 causes. This study aims to make predictions about the contribution of baseline cough or fever to future testing demand in the UK. Methods: In this analysis of the Bug Watch prospective community cohort study, we estimated the incidence of cough or fever in England in 2018-2019. We then estimated the COVID-19 diagnostic testing rates required in the UK for baseline cough or fever cases for the period July 2020-June 2021. This was explored for different rates of the population requesting tests and four second wave scenarios and then compared to current national capacity. Results: The baseline incidence of cough or fever in the UK is expected to rise rapidly from 154,554 (95%CI 103,083 - 231,725) cases per day in August 2020 to 250,708 (95%CI 181,095 - 347,080) in September, peaking at 444,660 (95%CI 353,084 - 559,988) in December. If 80% of baseline cough or fever cases request tests, average daily UK testing demand would exceed current capacity for five consecutive months (October 2020 to February 2021), with a peak demand of 147,240 (95%CI 73,978 - 239,502) tests per day above capacity in December 2020. Conclusions: Our results show that current national COVID-19 testing capacity is likely to be exceeded by demand due to baseline cough and fever alone. This study highlights that the UK's response to the COVID-19 pandemic must ensure that a high proportion of people with symptoms request tests, and that testing capacity is immediately scaled up to meet this high predicted demand.","Eyre, M.

The rheological, anti-inflammatory, and renin-angiotensin axis properties of PTX highlight this drug as a therapeutic treatment alternative for patients with COVID-19 by helping reduce the production of the inflammatory cytokines without deleterious effects on the immune system to delay viral clearance. Moreover, PTX can restore the balance of the immune response, reduce damage to the endothelium and alveolar epithelial cells, improve circulation, and prevent microvascular thrombosis. There is further evidence that PTX can improve ventilatory parameters. Therefore, we propose repositioning PTX in the treatment of COVID-19. The main advantage of repositioning PTX is that it is an affordable drug that is already available worldwide with an established safety profile, further offering the possibility of immediately analysing the result of its use and associated success rates. Another advantage is that PTX selectively reduces the concentration of TNF-α mRNA in cells, which, in the case of an acute infectious state such as COVID-19, would seem to offer a more strategic approach.","Maldonado, Valente; Loza-Mejía; Chávez Alderete, Jaime",Med Hypotheses,292,16

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that affects over 71 million people in the global population. Hepatocytes infected with HCV produce types I and III IFNs. These endogenous IFNs upregulate a set of ISGs that negatively impact the outcome of pegylated IFN-α and ribavirin treatments, which were previously used to treat HCV. In addition, the IFNL4 genotype was the primary polymorphism responsible for a suboptimal treatment response to pegylated IFN-α and ribavirin. However, recently developed direct-acting antivirals have demonstrated a high rate of sustained virological response without pegylated IFN-α.

A cross-sectional study,20.409498,6.3680553,2021-01-25,"COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), spread rapidly and affected most of the world since its outbreak in Wuhan, China, which presents a major challenge to the emergency response mechanism for sudden public health events and epidemic prevention and control in all countries. In the face of the severe situation of epidemic prevention and control and the arduous task of social management, the tremendous power of science and technology in prevention and control has emerged. The new generation of information technology, represented by big data and artificial intelligence (AI) technology, has been widely used in the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and management of COVID-19 as an important basic support. Although the technology has developed, there are still challenges with respect to epidemic surveillance, accurate prevention and control, effective diagnosis and treatment, and timely judgement. The prevention and control of sudden infectious diseases usually depend on the control of infection sources, interruption of transmission channels and vaccine development. Big data and AI are effective technologies to identify the source of infection and have an irreplaceable role in distinguishing close contacts and suspicious populations. Advanced computational analysis is beneficial to accelerate the speed of vaccine research and development and to improve the quality of vaccines. AI provides support in automatically processing relevant data from medical images and clinical features, tests and examination findings; predicting disease progression and prognosis; and even recommending treatment plans and strategies. This paper reviews the application of big data and AI in the COVID-19 prevention, diagnosis, treatment and management decisions in China to explain how to apply big data and AI technology to address the common problems in the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the findings regarding the application of big data and AI technologies in sudden public health events lack validation of repeatability and universality, current studies in China have shown that the application of big data and AI is feasible in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These studies concluded that the application of big data and AI technology can contribute to prevention, diagnosis, treatment and management decision making regarding sudden public health events in the future.","Dong, Jiancheng; Wu, Huiqun; Zhou, Dong; Li, Kaixiang; Zhang, Yuanpeng; Ji, Hanzhen; Tong, Zhuang; Lou, Shuai; Liu, Zhangsuo",J Med Syst,292,2

We aimed to rapidly evaluate the impact and effectiveness of these communication materials for passengers in the early stages of the pandemic. Study design Mixed-methods evaluation. Methods A cross-sectional survey and follow-up interviews with passengers arriving at London Heathrow Airport on scheduled flights from China and Singapore. The survey assessed passengers’ knowledge of symptoms, actions to take and attitudes towards PHE COVID-19 public health information; interviews explored their views of official public health information and self-isolation. Results 121 passengers participated in the survey and 15 in follow-up interviews. 83% of surveyed passengers correctly identified all three COVID-19 associated symptoms listed in PHE information at that time. Most could identify the recommended actions and found the advice understandable and trustworthy. Interviews revealed that passengers shared concerns about the lack of wider official action, and that passengers’ knowledge had been acquired elsewhere as much from PHE. Respondents also noted their own agency in choosing to self-isolate, partially as a self-protective measure. Conclusion PHE COVID-19 public health information was perceived as clear and acceptable, but we found that passengers acquired knowledge from various sources and they saw the provision of information alone on arrival as an insufficient official response.

Significant effort has been spent on identifying these variations and their impact on transmission, virulence and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. Binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) promotes cellular entry. Therefore, human ACE2 variations could also influence susceptibility or resistance to the virus.

However, it remains unclear how the acceptance and uptake of these apps can be improved. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the coverage of the SwissCovid app and the reasons for its nonuse in Switzerland during a period of increasing incidence of COVID-19 cases. METHODS: We collected data between September 28 and October 8, 2020, via a nationwide online panel survey (COVID-19 Social Monitor, N=1511). We examined sociodemographic and behavioral factors associated with app use by using multivariable logistic regression, whereas reasons for app nonuse were analyzed descriptively. RESULTS: Overall, 46.5% (703/1511) of the survey participants reported they used the SwissCovid app, which was an increase from 43.9% (662/1508) reported in the previous study wave conducted in July 2020. A higher monthly household income (ie, income >CHF 10,000 or >US $11,000 vs income ≤CHF 6000 or <US $6600 [reference]: odds ratio [OR] 1.92, 95% CI 1.40-2.64), more frequent internet use (ie, daily [reference] vs less than weekly: OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.16-0.85), better adherence to recommendations for wearing masks (ie, always or most of the time [reference] vs rarely or never: OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.15-0.52), and nonsmoker status (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.01-1.71) were associated with an increased likelihood for app uptake. Citizenship status (ie, non-Swiss citizenship vs. Swiss [reference]: OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.43-0.87), and language region (French vs Swiss German [reference]: OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.46-0.80) were associated with a lower likelihood for app uptake. Further analysis in a randomly selected subsample (n=712) with more detailed information showed that higher levels of trust in government and health authorities were also associated with a higher likelihood for app uptake (ie, high vs low [reference] trust: OR 3.13, 95% CI 1.58-6.22). The most frequent reasons for app nonuse were lack of perceived benefit of using the app (297/808, 36.8%), followed by the lack of a compatible phone (184/808, 22.8%), and privacy concerns (181/808, 22.4%).

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) seem to be more prone to a severe course of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) due to comorbidities and an altered immune system. The study’s aim was to identify factors predicting mortality among SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with CKD. METHODS: We analyzed 2817 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients enrolled in the Lean European Open Survey on SARS-CoV-2-infected patients and identified 426 patients with pre-existing CKD. Group comparisons were performed via Chi-squared test. Using univariate and multivariable logistic regression, predictive factors for mortality were identified. RESULTS: Comparative analyses to patients without CKD revealed a higher mortality (140/426, 32.9% versus 354/2391, 14.8%). Higher age could be confirmed as a demographic predictor for mortality in CKD patients (> 85 years compared to 15–65 years, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 6.49, 95% CI 1.27–33.20, p = 0.025).

Selected surfaces, based on those likely to be found on farms, were spiked with a range of concentrations of FMDV, left to dry and then the surface was swabbed with an electrostatic dust cloth. For aerosol sampling FMDV was nebulised at different concentrations and distances from the sampler. Recovery of viral RNA and infectious virus was measured by RT-qPCR and virus isolation, respectively. FMDV RNA was detected from all surfaces at all concentrations except from glass. Infectious virus was recovered from all surfaces but only at higher concentrations. The higher the starting concentration of virus the more efficient the recovery was from surfaces and recovery was more consistent from non-porous surfaces than porous surfaces. FMDV was detected in aerosol samples and the amount of virus recovered decreased as the distance between the nebuliser and sampler increased. The higher the starting concentration of virus the more efficient the recovery was from sampled aerosols.

Little also is known about the effects that on-campus outbreaks may have on local non-student and/or higher-risk communities. Model-based analysis can help inform decision and policy making across a wide range of assumptions and uncertainties. Objective: To evaluate the potential range of campus and community Covid-19 exposures, infections, and mortality due to various university and college reopening plans and precautions. Methods: We developed and calibrated campus-only, community-only, and campus-x-community epidemic models using standard susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered differential equation and agent-based modeling methods. Input parameters for campus and surrounding communities were estimated via published and grey literature, scenario development, expert opinion, Monte Carlo simulation, and accuracy optimization algorithms; models were cross-validated against each other using February-June 2020 county, state, and country data. Campus opening plans (spanning various fully open, hybrid, and fully virtual approaches) were identified from websites, publications, communications, and surveys. All scenarios were simulated assuming 16-week semesters and best/worst case ranges for disease prevalence among community residents and arriving students, precaution compliance, contact frequency, virus attack rates, and tracing and isolation effectiveness. Day-to-day student and community differences in exposures, infections, and mortality were estimated under each scenario as compared to regular and no re-opening; 10% trimmed medians, standard deviations, and probability intervals were computed to omit extreme outlier scenarios. Factorial analyses were conducted to identify inputs with largest and smallest impacts on outcomes. Results: As a base case, predicted 16-week student infections and mortality under normal operations with no precautions (or no compliance) ranged from 472 to 9,484 (4.7% to 94.8%) and 2 to 61 (0.02% to 0.61%) per 10,000 student population, respectively. In terms of contact tracing and isolation resources, as many as 17 to 1,488 total exposures per 10,000 students could occur on a given day throughout the semester needing to be located, tested, and if warranted quarantined. Attributable total additional predicted community exposures, infections, and mortality ranged from 1 to 187, 13 to 820, and 1 to 21, respectively, assuming the university takes no additional precautions to limit exposure risk. The mean (SD) number of days until 1% and 5% of on-campus students are infected was 11 (3) and 76 (17) days, respectively; 34.8% of replications resulted in more than 10% students infected by semester end. The diffusion first inflection point occurred on average on day 84 (+/- 20 days, 95% interval). Common re-opening precaution strategies reduced the above consequences by 24% to 26% fewer infections (now 360 to 6,976 per 10,000 students) and 36% to 50% fewer deaths (now 1 to 39 per 10,000 students). Perfect testing and immediate quarantining of all students on arrival to campus at semester start further reduced infections by 58% to 95% (now 200 to 468 per 10,000 students) and deaths by 95% to 100% (now 0 to 3 per 10,000 students). Uncertainties in many factors, however, produced tremendous variability in all median estimates, ranging by -67% to +370%. Conclusions: Consequences of reopening college and university physical campuses on student and community Covid-19 exposures, infections, and mortality are very highly unpredictable, depending on a combination of random chance, controllable (e.g. physical layouts), and uncontrollable (e.g. human behavior) factors. Important implications at government and academic institution levels include clear needs for specific criteria to adapt campus operations mid-semester, methods to detect when this is necessary, and well-executed contingency plans for doing so.","Benneyan, J.

Mathematical modelling and developed AI cannot explain several peaks in a single year. Object: This study was conducted to evaluate a rule of thumb for prediction from past wave experiences. Method: We rescaled the number of newly infected patients as 100% at the peak and checked similarities among waves. Then we extrapolated the courses of the third and later waves. Results: Results show some similarity around the second and the third waves. Based on this similarity, we expected the bottom of the third wave will show 2131 newly positive patients including asymptomatic patients at around the end of February, 2021. Discussion and Conclusion: We can infer the course of the third wave from similarity with the second wave. Mathematical modelling has been unable to do it, even when AI was used for prediction.

We sought to determine whether Internet search patterns can be useful for tracking COVID-19 spread, and whether these data could also be useful in understanding the clinical progression of the disease in 32 countries across six continents. Temporal correlation analyses were conducted to characterize the relationships between a range of COVID-19 symptom-specific search terms and reported COVID-19 cases and deaths for each country from January 1 through April 20, 2020. Increases in COVID-19 symptom-related searches preceded increases in reported COVID-19 cases and deaths by an average of 18.53 days (95% CI 15.98–21.08) and 22.16 days (20.33–23.99), respectively. Cross-country ensemble averaging was used to derive average temporal profiles for each search term, which were combined to create a search-data-based view of the clinical course of disease progression. Internet search patterns revealed a clear temporal pattern of disease progression for COVID-19: Initial symptoms of fever, dry cough, sore throat and chills were followed by shortness of breath an average of 5.22 days (3.30–7.14) after initial symptom onset, matching the clinical course reported in the medical literature. This study shows that Internet search data can be useful for characterizing the detailed clinical course of a disease. These data are available in real-time at population scale, providing important benefits as a complementary resource for tracking pandemics, especially before widespread laboratory testing is available.","Lu, Tina; Reis, Ben Y.",NPJ Digit Med,292,16

SUBJECTS/METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, we evaluated the nutritional status of elderly inpatients with COVID-19 using the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA). Based on MNA scores, patients were divided into non-malnutrition group (MNA ≥ 24), the group with risk of malnutrition (MNA 17–23.5) and malnutrition group (MNA score < 17). Regression analysis was conducted to screen for risk factors for malnutrition. RESULTS: A total of 182 patients were included in the study, of which 27.5% were in the group with malnutrition risk and 52.7% were in the malnutrition group. There were statistical differences in the incidence of comorbid diabetes mellitus, body mass index (BMI), calf circumference,albumin, hemoglobin, and lymphocyte counts among the three groups. Further regression analysis suggested that combined diabetes, low calf circumference, and low albumin were independent risk factors for malnutrition. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of malnutrition in elderly patients with COVID-19 was high, and nutritional support should be strengthened during treatment, especially for those with diabetes mellitus, low calf circumference, or low albumin.","Li, Tao; Zhang, Yalan; Gong, Cheng; Wang, Jing; Liu, Bao; Shi, Li; Duan, Jun",Eur J Clin Nutr,292,16

However, there are insufficient medical resources for their treatment in Japan due to two reasons. First, the numbers of headache specialists and clinics remain insufficient. Second, neurologists and neurosurgeons mainly treat headaches in Japan. However, they mainly work as general stroke neurologists, so they cannot focus on primary headache treatment. To solve these problems, we preliminarily developed a deep learning (DL)-based automated diagnosis model from patients’ Japanese unstructured sentences in the medical questionnaire using a DL framework. We hypothesized that the model would reduce the time and burden on both doctors and patients and improve their quality of life. METHODS: We retrospectively investigated our primary headache database and developed a diagnosis model using the DL framework (Prediction One, Sony Network Communications Inc., Japan). We used age, sex, date, and embedding layer made by the medical questionnaire’s natural language processing (NLP). RESULTS: Eight hundred and forty-eight primary headache patients (495 women and 353 men) are included. The median (interquartile range) age was 59 (40–74). Migraine accounted for 46%, tension-type headache for 47%, trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias for 5%, and other primary headache disorders for 2%. The accuracy, mean precision, mean recall, and mean F value of the developed diagnosis model were 0.7759, 0.8537, 0.6086, and 0.6353, which were satisfactory. CONCLUSION: The DL-based diagnosis model for primary headaches using the raw medical questionnaire’s Japanese NLP would be useful in performing efficient medical practice after ruling out the secondary headaches.","Katsuki, Masahito; Narita, Norio; Matsumori, Yasuhiko; Ishida, Naoya; Watanabe, Ohmi; Cai, Siqi; Tominaga, Teiji",Surg Neurol Int,292,20

Since COVID-19 emergence, many therapeutic regimens have been relentlessly explored, and although two vaccines have just received emergency use authorization by different governmental agencies, antiviral therapeutics based neutralizing antibodies and small-drug inhibitors can still be vital viable options to prevent and treat SARS-CoV-2 infections. The viral spike glycoprotein (S-protein) is the key molecular player that promotes human host cellular invasion via recognition of and binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 gene (ACE2). In this work, we report the results obtained by mutating in silico the 18 ACE2 residues and the 14 S-protein receptor binding domain (S-RBD(CoV-2)) residues that contribute to the receptor/viral protein binding interface. Specifically, each wild-type protein–protein interface residue was replaced by a hydrophobic (isoleucine), polar (serine and threonine), charged (aspartic acid/glutamic acid and lysine/arginine), and bulky (tryptophan) residue, respectively, in order to study the different effects exerted by nature, shape, and dimensions of the mutant amino acids on the structure and strength of the resulting binding interface. The computational results were next validated a posteriori against the corresponding experimental data, yielding an overall agreement of 92%. Interestingly, a non-negligible number of mis-sense variations were predicted to enhance ACE2/S-RBD(CoV-2) binding, including the variants Q24T, T27D/K/W, D30E, H34S7T/K, E35D, Q42K, L79I/W, R357K, and R393K on ACE2 and L455D/W, F456K/W, Q493K, N501T, and Y505W on S-RBD(CoV-2), respectively.","Laurini, Erik; Marson, Domenico; Aulic, Suzana; Fermeglia, Alice; Pricl, Sabrina",ACS Nano,292,20

The existence of a large but undetermined number of mild or non-symptomatic but infectious cases seems to be involved in the rapid spread, creating a high level of uncertainty due to the difficulty to measure them, and difficulty for epidemiologic modelling. Methods: We developed a compartmental model with deterministic equations, that accounts for clinical status, mobility, r heterogenous susceptibility and non-pharmaceutical interventions . The model was calibrated using data from different regions and we used it to predict the dynamic in Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area (AMBA). Results: The model adjusted well to different geographical regions. In AMBA the model predicted 21400 deaths at 300 days, with 27% of the population in the region immunized after the first wave, partly due to the high incidence of asymptomatic cases. The mobility restriction is approximately linear, with any restriction bringing a positive effect. The other interventions have a combined effect of 27% reduction in infection rates. Conclusion: Our research underlines the role of asymptomatic cases in the epidemics' dynamic and introduces the concept of susceptibility heterogeneity as a potential explanation for otherwise unexplained outbreak dynamics. The model also shows the big role of non-pharmaceutical interventions both in slowing down the epidemic dynamics and in reducing the eventual number of deaths. The model results are closely compatible with observed data.","Bullo, M.; Poy Pineiro, S.; Cosatto, P.; Seoane, H.; Picasso, E.",,292,16

The introduction of modern antibiotic treatment regimens and vaccine strategies has helped to lower the burden of bacterial pneumonia, yet due to the unavailability or refusal of vaccines and antimicrobials in parts of the global population, the rise of multidrug resistant pathogens, and high fatality rates even in patients treated with appropriate antibiotics pneumonia remains a global threat. As such, a better understanding of pathogen virulence on the one, and the development of innovative vaccine strategies on the other hand are once again in dire need in the perennial fight of men against microbes. Recent data show that the secretome of bacteria consists not only of soluble mediators of virulence but also to a significant proportion of extracellular vesicles—lipid bilayer-delimited particles that form integral mediators of intercellular communication. Extracellular vesicles are released from cells of all kinds of organisms, including both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria in which case they are commonly termed outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) and membrane vesicles (MVs), respectively. (O)MVs can trigger inflammatory responses to specific pathogens including S. pneumonia, P. aeruginosa, and L. pneumophila and as such, mediate bacterial virulence in pneumonia by challenging the host respiratory epithelium and cellular and humoral immunity. In parallel, however, (O)MVs have recently emerged as auspicious vaccine candidates due to their natural antigenicity and favorable biochemical properties. First studies highlight the efficacy of such vaccines in animal models exposed to (O)MVs from B. pertussis, S. pneumoniae, A. baumannii, and K. pneumoniae. An advanced and balanced recognition of both the detrimental effects of (O)MVs and their immunogenic potential could pave the way to novel treatment strategies in pneumonia and effective preventive approaches.","Behrens, Felix; Funk-Hilsdorf, Teresa C.; Kuebler, Wolfgang M.; Simmons, Szandor",Int J Mol Sci,292,20

Existing direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs cannot be applied immediately to new viruses because of virus-specificity, and the development of new DAA drugs from the beginning is not timely for outbreaks. Thus, host-targeting antiviral (HTA) drugs have many advantages to fight against a broad spectrum of viruses, by blocking the viral replication and overcoming the potential viral mutagenesis simultaneously. Herein, we identified two potent inhibitors of DHODH, S312 and S416, with favorable drug-like and pharmacokinetic profiles, which all showed broad-spectrum antiviral effects against various RNA viruses, including influenza A virus (H1N1, H3N2, H9N2), Zika virus, Ebola virus, and particularly against the recent novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Our results are the first to validate that DHODH is an attractive host target through high antiviral efficacy in vivo and low virus replication in DHODH knocking-out cells. We also proposed the drug combination of DAA and HTA was a promising strategy for anti-virus treatment and proved that S312 showed more advantageous than Oseltamivir to treat advanced influenza diseases in severely infected animals. Notably, S416 is reported to be the most potent inhibitor with an EC50 of 17nM and SI value >5882 in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells so far. This work demonstrates that both our self-designed candidates and old drugs (Leflunomide/Teriflunomide) with dual actions of antiviral and immuno-repression may have clinical potentials not only to influenza but also to COVID-19 circulating worldwide, no matter such viruses mutate or not.","Xiong, Rui; Zhang, Leike; Li, Shiliang; Sun, Yuan; Ding, Minyi; Wang, Yong; Zhao, Yongliang; Wu, Yan; Shang, Weijuan; Jiang, Xiaming; Shan, Jiwei; Shen, Zihao; Tong, Yi; Xu, Liuxin; Yu, Chen; Liu, Yingle; Zou, Gang; Lavillete, Dimitri; Zhao, Zhenjiang; Wang, Rui; Zhu, Lili; Xiao, Gengfu; Lan, Ke; Li, Honglin; Xu, Ke",bioRxiv,292,5

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from cells are nano‐sized membrane‐bound vesicles that carry nucleic acids and proteins and mediate intercellular communication. In COVID‐19 associated comorbidities including diabetes, CVD and risk factors such as hypertension, elevated angiotensin II and obesity, levels of circulating EVs are raised and their cargo modified. Importantly, EVs released from damaged endothelial cells are known to be procoagulant. EVs in Black and White populations differentially express phosphorylated insulin signalling proteins, associated with impaired insulin signalling, insulin resistance and an increased risk of venous thromboembolism; these EV proteins are also associated with clinical mortality risk markers. If plasma EV levels are raised, and cargo modified in comorbidities associated with COVID‐19 such as diabetes, and account for excess deaths in BAME patients, this raises the possibility for important roles of EVs, also relating to ethnicity. This places EVs as hitherto understudied key factors, filling the current knowledge gap in COVID‐19, amongst BAME patients.","Inal, Jameel",Br J Haematol,292,8

The data was analyzed using grounded theory. Safety was a key concern of the lay public, expressed in terms of fear of death. The notion of infecting a healthy volunteer, the possibility of continued effects beyond the study duration and the likelihood of vulnerable populations volunteering solely for monetary benefit, were ethical concerns. Public good outcomes such as effective treatments, targeted vaccines and prevention of diseases was necessary justification for such studies. However, the comprehension of this benefit was not clear among non-medical, non-technical respondents and suggestions to seek alternatives to CHIMs repeatedly arose. There was a great deal of deflection—with each constituency feeling that people other than themselves may be ideally suited as participants. Risk takers, those without dependents, the more health and research literate, financially sound and those with an altruistic bent of mind emerged as possible CHIM volunteers. While widespread awareness and advocacy about CHIM is essential, listening to plural voices is the first step in public engagement in ethically contentious areas.

Objective: This study estimated the sectoral allocation of gross disbursements of ODA of the 29 Development Assistance Committee (DAC) member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) for the duration of 2011 to 2018, by aid type (bilateral, multilateral, and both aids). Methods: Data from the OECD iLibrary were used. The sector definition was based on the OECD sector classification. For core funding to multilateral agencies that do not specialize in each aid sector, we estimated ODA and its flows based on the OECD methodology for calculating imputed multilateral ODA. Results: For all 29 countries, during the period of 2014–2018 where data were available for all the countries, the sector with the highest average annual ODA contribution was health at 20.34 billion USD (13.21%), followed by humanitarian aid at 18.04 billion (11.72%). Humanitarian aid has increased in the sectoral share rankings in both bilateral and multilateral aid, and the sectoral share for refugees in donor countries has increased in bilateral aid. While the 29 countries show relatively similar trends for sectoral shares, some countries and sectors display unique trends. For instance, infrastructure and energy sectors in bilateral aid of Japan are particularly high accounts for 48.48% of the total bilateral ODA of the country in 2018. Conclusions: This paper evaluated ODA trends by major donors of DAC countries in the pre-COVID-19 pandemic periods.

METHODOLOGY: A total of 1,160 adult respondents of the 2013 NNS living in the National Capital Region, Philippines were enrolled. Of the 1,160 sequenced samples, 833 passed the stringent quality control based on multiple parameters and were used for further analysis. Total serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] was determined using electro-chemiluminescence binding assay method. Genomic DNA was used for targeted next generation sequencing of 502 lifestyle and nutrition related polymorphisms. Analysis of variance, followed by Tukey post hoc analysis, was employed to compare 25(OH)D serum levels across genotypes. RESULTS: Of the study participants, 56% was classified as having low serum 25(OH)D. The lower serum 25(OH)D was observed in the following gene/genotypes: KNG1 rs11924390 T/T; ANKH rs2454873 G/G; NPFFR2 rs4129733 T/G; SH2B1 rs4788102 G/A; RAP1A rs494453 T/T and CRHBP rs7728378 T/C. These genes were previously associated to the risk of osteoporosis, obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and stress response. CONCLUSION: Large-scale analysis of genes has shown great utility in the discovery of genetic factors that play a role in vitamin D nutrition. Interestingly, loci found in this Filipino population cohort were mostly independent from the canonical vitamin D synthesis and metabolism pathways. Understanding how genetic variations interact with nutrition and lifestyle may aid in the prevention of diseases through screening and identification of susceptible patients who would not benefit from regular supplementation with vitamin D because of genetic alterations and may also be used as basis for future development of functional food enriched with vitamin D.","Zumaraga, Mark Pretzel; Concepcion, Mae Anne; Duante, Charmaine; Rodriguez, Marietta",J ASEAN Fed Endocr Soc,292,1

Following the first outbreak, more than half of the population of the Bergamo province had been infected. We aimed to describe the patients admitted to our unit shortly after the first outbreak. Methods: we retrospectively reviewed the notes of all pediatric patients diagnosed with COVID-19. We enrolled patients with positive swabs or serology and classified them based on the pattern and the timing of presentation after the first outbreak. This setting was considered a reliable reflection of the consequences of unmitigated SARS-CoV-2 circulation. Results: We diagnosed 35 patients over a 3-month period and we identified six patterns presenting in two temporal phases: Early phase, Group 1 (median of 20 days from epidemic start, IQR: 15–27): neonatal sepsis (n.7), pneumonia (n.5), flu-like symptoms (n.2). Late phase, Group 2 (59:51–66 days, p < 0.001): MIS-C (n.18), neurological manifestations (n.3). Group 1 differed from Group 2 for younger age (1 vs. 8 years, p = 0.02), lower C-reactive protein (0.9 vs. 16.6 mg/dl, p = 0.008), procalcitonin (0.16 vs. 7.9 ng/ml, p = 0.008) and neutrophil count (3,765 vs. 6,780/μl, p = 0.006), higher rate of positive swabs (14/14 vs. 9/21, p < 0.001), higher lymphocyte count (3,000 vs. 930/μl, p = 0.006) and platelet count (323,000 vs. 210,000/μl, p = 0.009).

The aim of the study was to assess the ability of PCT or CRP combined with clinical characteristics to distinguish between viral and bacterial infections in hospitalized non-intensive care unit (ICU) adults with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). METHODS: This was a post-hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial previously conducted among LRTI patients. The ability of PCT, CRP and PCT or CRP combined with clinical symptoms to discriminate between viral and bacterial infection were assessed by portraying receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves among patients with only a viral or a typical bacterial infection. RESULTS: In total, 209 infected patients (viral 69%, bacterial 31%) were included in the study. When using CRP or PCT to discriminate between viral and bacterial LRTI, the optimal cut-off points were 22 mg/L and 0.18 ng/mL, respectively. When the optimal cut-off for CRP (≤ 22 mg/L) or PCT (≤ 0.18 ng/mL) combined with rhinorrhea was used to discriminate viral from bacterial LRTI, the AUCs were 0.81 (95% CI: 0.75–0.87) and 0.80 (95% CI: 0.74–0.86), which was statistically significantly better than when CRP or PCT used alone (p < 0.001). When CRP ≤ 22 mg/L, PCT ≤ 0.18 ng/mL and rhinorrhea were combined, the AUC was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.80–0.91), which was statistically significantly higher than when CRP (≤ 22 mg/L) or PCT (≤ 0.18 ng/mL) was combined with rhinorrhea (p = 0.011 and p = 0.021). CONCLUSIONS: Either CRP ≤ 22 mg/L or PCT ≤ 0.18 ng/mL combined with rhinorrhea could help distinguish viral from bacterial infections in hospitalized non-ICU adults with LRTI.

The primary aim of the study is to assess management of acute haemolytic crisis (AHC) in glucose‐6‐phosphate dehydrogenase(G6PD)‐ deficient children during SARs‐COV‐2 pandemic, and then to assess blood donation situation and the role of telemedicine in management. METHODS: Assessment of G6PD‐deficient children attending the Emergency Department (ER) with AHC from 1 March 2020 for 5 months in comparison to same period in the previous 2 years, in three paediatric haematology centres. AHC cases presenting with infection were tested for SARs‐COV‐2 using RT‐PCR. Children with Hb (50–65 g/L) and who were not transfused, were followed up using telemedicine with Hb re‐checked in 24 h. RESULTS: A 45% drop in ER visits due to G6PD deficiency‐related AHC during SARs‐COV‐2 pandemic in comparison to the previous 2 years was observed. 10% of patients presented with fever and all tested negative for COVID‐19 by RT‐PCR. 33% of patients had Hb < 50 g/L and were all transfused. 50% had Hb between 50 and 65 g/L, half of them (n = 49) did not receive transfusion and only two patients (4%) required transfusion upon follow up. A restrictive transfusion strategy was adopted and one of the reasons was a 39% drop in blood donation in participating centres. CONCLUSION: Fewer G6PD‐deficient children with AHC visited the ER during SARs‐COV‐2 and most tolerated lower Hb levels. Telemedicine was an efficient tool to support their families.

In this study, label-free proteomics was performed to examine protein expression in tongue sole spleen induced by megalocytivirus at 8 and 12 days post infection (dpi). Compared to uninfected control fish, virus-infected fish displayed 315 up-regulated proteins and 111 down-regulated proteins at 8 dpi, and 48 up-regulated proteins and 43 down-regulated proteins at 12 dpi. The expressions of five differentially expressed proteins were confirmed by Western blot. The differentially expressed proteins were enriched in the pathways and processes associated with innate immune response and viral infection. Interference with the expression of two up-regulated proteins of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS), i.e. proteasome assembly chaperone 2 and proteasome maturation protein, significantly reduced viral propagation in fish, whereas overexpression of these two proteins significantly enhanced viral propagation. Consistently, inhibition of the functioning of proteasome significantly impaired viral replication in vivo.

METHODS: Four focus group discussions among recovered COVID-19 patients were organized and conducted via video conference to collect their insights on public health messages. Upon culmination of each discussion, we held debrief sessions with a particular focus on the responses and making notes of comments. Qualitative themes were also recorded at the end of each focus group. RESULTS: All 40 participants were COVID-19 recovered cases. The participants' mean age was 33.4±28.5 years, and 70.0% (n = 28) were males. We observed a generally positive attitude towards public health messages. However, it was stressed that the nature of such behavioral change posed a significant risk for psychological health. Lack of social interaction, for example, led to lower motivation, a sense of losing the meaning of life, and personal distress. While all participants acknowledged and appreciated the government authorities' efforts in disseminating and educating the masses on such a large scale using different modes of message delivery, all showed a serious concern as to whether they will be able to continue coping with the ongoing situation. CONCLUSIONS: The participants' responses suggest that public health messaging brought a significant social change in Oman. However, this conclusion cannot be generalized. Further, there is a continued need for strong public health policies with a particular focus on psychological health.","Al Araimi, Fannah Al Fannah; Langrial, Sitwat Usman; Al Awaidy, Salah T.",Oman Med J,292,24

Care plans have been introduced in many healthcare settings to provide a patient-centred approach that is both evidence-based to deliver positive clinical outcomes and allow individualised care. The Alphabet strategy (AS) for diabetes is based around such a care plan and has been evidenced to deliver high clinical standards in both well-resourced and under-resourced settings. Additional patient educational resources include special care plans for those people with diabetes undertaking fasting during Ramadan, Preconception Care, Prevention and Remission of Diabetes. The Strategy and Care Plan has facilitated evidence-based, cost-efficient multifactorial intervention with an improvement in the National Diabetes Audit targets for blood pressure, cholesterol levels and glycated haemoglobin. Many of these attainments were of the standard seen in intensively treated cohorts of key randomized controlled trials in diabetes care such as the Steno-2 and United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study.

METHODS: Two hundred ninety-nine respiratory samples were prospectively explored using multiplex molecular techniques (FilmArray Respiratory Panel, Clart Pneumovir), immunological techniques (direct fluorescent assay, lateral flow chromatography) and cell cultures. FINDINGS: Molecular techniques permitted the recovery of up to 50% more respiratory pathogens in comparison to non-molecular methods. FilmArray detected at least 30% more pathogens than Clart Pneumovir which could be explained by the differences in their technical designs. The turnaround time under 2 hours for the FilmArray permitted delivery of results when patients were still in the emergency room.","Busson, L.; Bartiaux, M.; Brahim, S.; Konopnicki, D.; Dauby, N.; Gérard, M.; De Backer, P.; Van Vaerenbergh, K.; Mahadeb, B.; De Foor, M.; Wautier, M.; Vandenberg, O.; Mols, P.; Levy, J.; Hallin, M.",J Virol Methods,292,1

METHODS: This is a multi-center retrospective observational study involving 59 Italian centers. We retrospectively reviewed the prevalence of interstitial pneumonia detected during the COVID period (between March 16 and 27, 2020) and compared to a pre-COVID period (January–February 2020) and a control time (in 2019). The diagnosis of interstitial pneumonia was done considering lung alterations of CT of PET. RESULTS: Overall, [(18)F]FDG PET/CT was performed on 4008 patients in the COVID period, 19,267 in the pre-COVID period, and 5513 in the control period. The rate of interstitial pneumonia suspicious for COVID-19 was significantly higher during the COVID period (7.1%) compared with that found in the pre-COVID (5.35%) and control periods (5.15%) (p < 0.001). Instead, no significant difference among pre-COVID and control periods was present. The prevalence of interstitial pneumonia detected at PET/CT was directly associated with geographic virus diffusion, with the higher rate in Northern Italy. Among 284 interstitial pneumonia detected during COVID period, 169 (59%) were FDG-avid (average SUVmax of 4.1). CONCLUSIONS: A significant increase of interstitial pneumonia incidentally detected with [(18)F]FDG PET/CT has been demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic. A majority of interstitial pneumonia were FDG-avid. Our results underlined the importance of paying attention to incidental CT findings of pneumonia detected at PET/CT, and these reports might help to recognize early COVID-19 cases guiding the subsequent management.

The World Health Organization (WHO) is working with health partners on the rollout and implementation of a robust electronic field data collection platform. The delay in the deployment and rollout of this electronic platform in the WHO African Region, as a consequence of the application of large-scale public health and social measures including movement restrictions and geographical area quarantine, left a gap between data collection and management. This lead to the need to develop interim data management solutions to accurately monitor the evolution of the pandemic and support the deployment of appropriate public health interventions. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to review the design, development, and implementation of the COVID-19 Data Summarization and Visualization (DSV) tool as a rapidly deployable solution to fill this critical data collection gap as an interim solution. METHODS: This paper reviews the processes undertaken to research and develop a tool to bridge the data collection gap between the onset of a COVID-19 outbreak and the start of data collection using a prioritized electronic platform such as Go.Data in the WHO African Region. RESULTS: In anticipation of the implementation of a prioritized tool for field data collection, the DSV tool was deployed in 18 member states for COVID-19 outbreak data management. We highlight preliminary findings and lessons learned from the DSV tool deployment in the WHO African Region. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a rapidly deployable tool for COVID-19 data collection and visualization in the WHO African Region. The lessons drawn on this experience offer an opportunity to learn and apply these to improve future similar public health informatics initiatives in an outbreak or similar humanitarian setting, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.","Ahmed, Kamran; Bukhari, Muhammad Arish; Mlanda, Tamayi; Kimenyi, Jean Paul; Wallace, Polly; Okot Lukoya, Charles; Hamblion, Esther L; Impouma, Benido",JMIR Public Health Surveill,292,16

To achieve this both literacy needs and patterns of knowledge sharing must be understood within the context of the disease being studied. It is also important to understand these processes from both offline (HL) and online (eHL) perspectives and amongst demographics with access to different types of information and social capital, and who have different levels of vulnerability. This paper discusses the insights gained over a series of 30 interviews with the UK residents aged either 19 − 30 years of age or older than 70 years—focussing on how they seek, understand, evaluate and convey information about COVID-19 during the current pandemic. Using thematic analysis, we identified themes around motivations to seek information, the information journey, digital choice and engagement, dilemmas and challenges of managing and appraising information, and sharing information. There was little difference in the eHL between the two age groups who both had high levels of education and were sophisticated digital citizens. The COVID-19 pandemic highlights three dominant processes in managing complex and uncertain information: some individuals may suffer from information fatigue but there was no evidence of any impact on their behaviours; others seek and share information across many networks; and there were strikingly high levels of distrust leading to complex processes of meaning-making demanding critical health literacy skills.","Sykes, Susie; Wills, Jane; Trasolini, Andrew; Wood, Kerry; Frings, Daniel",Health Promot Int,292,1

We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of azithromycin in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. METHODS: In this randomised, controlled, open-label, adaptive platform trial (Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy [RECOVERY]), several possible treatments were compared with usual care in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 in the UK. The trial is underway at 176 hospitals in the UK. Eligible and consenting patients were randomly allocated to either usual standard of care alone or usual standard of care plus azithromycin 500 mg once per day by mouth or intravenously for 10 days or until discharge (or allocation to one of the other RECOVERY treatment groups). Patients were assigned via web-based simple (unstratified) randomisation with allocation concealment and were twice as likely to be randomly assigned to usual care than to any of the active treatment groups. Participants and local study staff were not masked to the allocated treatment, but all others involved in the trial were masked to the outcome data during the trial. The primary outcome was 28-day all-cause mortality, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. The trial is registered with ISRCTN, 50189673, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04381936. FINDINGS: Between April 7 and Nov 27, 2020, of 16 442 patients enrolled in the RECOVERY trial, 9433 (57%) were eligible and 7763 were included in the assessment of azithromycin. The mean age of these study participants was 65·3 years (SD 15·7) and approximately a third were women (2944 [38%] of 7763). 2582 patients were randomly allocated to receive azithromycin and 5181 patients were randomly allocated to usual care alone. Overall, 561 (22%) patients allocated to azithromycin and 1162 (22%) patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio 0·97, 95% CI 0·87–1·07; p=0·50). No significant difference was seen in duration of hospital stay (median 10 days [IQR 5 to >28] vs 11 days [5 to >28]) or the proportion of patients discharged from hospital alive within 28 days (rate ratio 1·04, 95% CI 0·98–1·10; p=0·19). Among those not on invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline, no significant difference was seen in the proportion meeting the composite endpoint of invasive mechanical ventilation or death (risk ratio 0·95, 95% CI 0·87–1·03; p=0·24). INTERPRETATION: In patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, azithromycin did not improve survival or other prespecified clinical outcomes. Azithromycin use in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 should be restricted to patients in whom there is a clear antimicrobial indication.

Previous studies established that mRNAs can be delivered to cells in vitro and in vivo via RNA-loaded lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). Here we describe an alternative approach using exosomes, the only biologically normal nanovesicle. In contrast to LNPs, which elicited pronounced cellular toxicity, exosomes had no adverse effects in vitro or in vivo at any dose tested. Moreover, mRNA-loaded exosomes were characterized by efficient mRNA encapsulation (∼90%), high mRNA content, consistent size, and a polydispersity index under 0.2. Using an mRNA encoding the red light-emitting luciferase Antares2, we observed that mRNA-loaded exosomes were superior to mRNA-loaded LNPs at delivering functional mRNA into human cells in vitro. Injection of Antares2 mRNA-loaded exosomes also led to strong light emission following injection into the vitreous fluid of the eye or into the tissue of skeletal muscle in mice. Furthermore, we show that repeated injection of Antares2 mRNA-loaded exosomes drove sustained luciferase expression across six injections spanning at least 10 weeks, without evidence of signal attenuation or adverse injection site responses. Consistent with these findings, we observed that exosomes loaded with mRNAs encoding immunogenic forms of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and Nucleocapsid proteins induced long-lasting cellular and humoral responses to both. Taken together, these results demonstrate that exosomes can be used to deliver functional mRNA to and into cells in vivo.","Tsai, Shang Jui; Atai, Nadia A.; Cacciottolo, Mafalda; Nice, Justin; Salehi, Arjang; Guo, Chenxu; Sedgwick, Alanna; Kanagavelu, Saravana; Gould, Stephen J.",J Biol Chem,292,26

This review aimed to comprehensively explore the diverse alkaloids isolated and identified from different species of genus Aspergillus that were found to be associated with different marine organisms regarding their chemistry and biology. Around 174 alkaloid metabolites were reported, 66 of which showed important biological activities with respect to the tested biological activities mainly comprising antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, cytotoxic, antioxidant and antifouling activities. Besides, in silico studies on different microbial proteins comprising DNA-gyrase, topoisomerase IV, dihydrofolate reductase, transcriptional regulator TcaR (protein), and aminoglycoside nucleotidyl transferase were done for sixteen alkaloids that showed anti-infective potential for better mechanistic interpretation of their probable mode of action.

Effective nursing care includes actions to develop nurse–patient relationships and deliver physical and psychosocial care to patients. The high risk of transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus compromises nursing care. No evidence-based nursing guidelines exist for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, leading to potential variations in patient experience, outcomes, quality and costs. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: we aim to recruit 840 in-patient participants treated for infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus from 14 UK hospitals, to a cluster randomised controlled trial, with embedded process and economic evaluations, of care as usual and a fundamental nursing care protocol addressing specific areas of physical, relational and psychosocial nursing care where potential variation may occur, compared with care as usual. Our coprimary outcomes are patient-reported experience (Quality from the Patients’ Perspective; Relational Aspects of Care Questionnaire); secondary outcomes include care quality (pressure injuries, falls, medication errors); functional ability (Barthell Index); treatment outcomes (WHO Clinical Progression Scale); depression Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2), anxiety General Anxiety Disorder-2 (GAD-2), health utility (EQ5D) and nurse-reported outcomes (Measure of Moral Distress for Health Care Professionals). For our primary analysis, we will use a standard generalised linear mixed-effect model adjusting for ethnicity of the patient sample and research intensity at cluster level. We will also undertake a planned subgroup analysis to compare the impact of patient-level ethnicity on our primary and secondary outcomes and will undertake process and economic evaluations.

METHODS: The study population included the 14,000 members of Leumit Health Services who were tested for COVID‐19 infection from February 1(st) to April 30(th) 2020, and who had at least one previous blood test for plasma 25(OH)D level. ""Suboptimal"" or ""low"" plasma 25(OH)D level was defined as plasma 25‐hydroxyvitamin D, or 25(OH)D, concentration below the level of 30 ng/mL. RESULTS: Of 7,807 individuals, 782 (10.1%) were COVID‐19‐positive, and 7,025 (89.9%) COVID‐19‐negative. The mean plasma vitamin D level was significantly lower among those who tested positive than negative for COVID‐19 [19.00 ng/mL (95% confidence interval [CI] 18.41‐19.59) vs. 20.55 (95% CI 20.32‐20.78)].

At the time of writing this article, there are officially about five million infections and more than 300 000 deaths. Statistics vary widely from country to country, revealing significant differences in anticipation and management of the crisis. We propose to examine the COVID-19 epidemic in Tunisia through mathematical models, which aim to determine the actual number of infected cases and to predict the course of the epidemic. As of May 11, 2020, there are officially 1032 COVID-19 infected cases in Tunisia. 45 people have died. Using a mathematical model based on the number of reported infected cases, the number of deaths, and the effect of the 18-day delay between infection and death, this study estimates the actual number of COVID-19 cases in Tunisia as 2555 cases. This paper analyses the evolution of the epidemic in Tunisia using population dynamics with an SEIR model combining susceptible cases S(t), asymptomatic infected cases A(t), reported infected cases V (t), and unreported infected cases U(t). This work measures the basic reproduction number R0, which is the average number of people infected by a COVID-19 infected person. The model predicts an R0 = 2.73. Strict containment measures have led to a significant reduction in the reproduction rate. Contact tracing and respect for isolation have an impact: at the current time, we compute that Tunisia has an Rt = 0.42 (95% CI 0.14-0.70). These values depend on physical separation and can vary over time depending on the management of suspicious cases. Their objective estimation and the study of their evolution are however necessary to understand the pandemic and to reduce their unintended damage (due to an absence of symptoms, or the confusion of certain symptoms with less contagious diseases, or unavailable or unreliable tests).","Abdeljaoued-Tej, I.",,292,26

Currently in 2020, this apprehension has revolved from an imaginary problem to an actual challenge that might have consequences for millions nationwide due to COVID-19 pandemic. Now, African countries can realize that putting all our eggs in one basket was not such a good idea.

Cross-sectional surveys and covariance-based structural equation modelling tools were used. In addition, univariate variance analysis was used to address the effects of socio-demographic variables (years of service on a cruise ship, working department on a cruise ship, gender, age, educational level and place of residency) on latent variables of the conceptual model. The conceptual model draws on existing theory and previous research and was empirically tested on a sample of cruise ship employee internet users. Result show that while being onboard a cruise ship, employees experience strong social pressure to be constantly available and they fear of missing out on important information and life events. Thus, relatedness to friends and family needs satisfaction is of paramount importance for cruise ship employees because they are fully aware that they are dispensable and replaceable to cruise ship companies, however to their friends and family, they are indispensable and unique. Moreover, employees who engage in other tasks/activities while taking part in online communication with friends and family exhibit reduced performance, which leads to poor interaction and social dissatisfaction. Lastly, employees experiencing under-reciprocating exchanges show significant negative effects on their well-being. Overall, the results provided several important theoretical and practical implications relevant to cruise tourism and human resource management.","Radic, Aleksandar; Ariza-Montes, Antonio; Hernández-Perlines, Felipe; Giorgi, Gabriele",Int J Environ Res Public Health,292,1

These unconventional fluorescent polymers are in general composed of heteroatoms (e.g. N, O, P, and S) under different forms. Here we report our recent study on polyurea, prepared by a very simple one step precipitation polymerization of toluene diisocyanate in a binary solvent of water-acetone. This polyurea, basically consisting of phenyl ring and urea group, shows fluorescent emission in a broad concentration range, from very low (10(-5) mg/mL) to its solubility limit (50 mg/mL), and in a wide range of emission wavelength from UV to visible regions of up to 500 nm under varied excitation wavelength. The emission behaviors were fully studied under different concentrations and excitations. It was concluded that the emission in UV region was intrinsic due to the conjugation between the phenyl and the adjacent urea unit; while the emission in visible region, strongly excitation dependent, was caused by the cluster formation of the molecular chains, in accordance with the cluster-triggered-emission (CTE) mechanism. The formation of the cluster was tested through dynamic light scattering, FTIR and UV absorbance. Tested in presence of different metal ions, Fe(3+) demonstrated a quenching effect with high selectivity. Based on this study, different paper-based sensors were designed to detect Fe(3+), H(2)O(2) in bioanalysis and for data encryption. This work provides a simple way to prepare a polyurea, a novel type of unconventional fluorescent polymer, with high emission performance distinct from its known analogues.","Cao, Hongyan; Li, Bin; Jiang, Xubao; Zhu, Xiaoli; Zheng Kong, Xiang",Chem Eng J,292,29

The SARS incidence among EMTs was assessed by investigating probable SARS (P‐SARS) and by surveying the seroprevalence of SARS‐associated coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) antibody. Results: From March 18 to June 19, 2003, there were 7,961 EMS transports, similar to the volume projected from previous years (7,506) (95% CI = 6,688 to 8,324). Of these, 1,760 (22.1%) were SARS‐related. When SARS‐related transports were excluded, there was a 12.2% decrease (95% CI = 11.4% to 12.9%) in EMS activities. Requests from hospitals, quarantined individuals, and febrile citizens accounted for 23%, 18%, and 59% of SARS‐related transports. Among the 397 P‐SARS cases in the city of 2.65 million people (incidence 0.01%, 95% CI = 0.01% to 0.02%), 138 (35%) required EMS transports. Two EMTs working in team C, the team with the lowest risk, developed P‐SARS. One of them died soon thereafter. The incidence of P‐SARS was 0.6% (95% CI = 0.2% to 2.2%), or 0.1% (95% CI = 0.03% to 0.4%) per transport. SARS‐CoV serology was available in 74.1% of EMTs who were alive. In addition to the surviving P‐SARS EMT, one EMT from team A, the team with the highest risk, was seropositive. Combining P‐SARS and the seropositive case, three EMTs were infected (incidence 1.3%, 95% CI = 0.4% to 3.6%). No patient transported by the infected EMTs developed SARS. The hospitals serving EMS by the infected EMTs had been involved in a clustered outbreak prior to the EMTs' infections. Conclusions: During the outbreak of SARS, the overall EMS volume did not change significantly, but the non‐SARS EMS activities decreased. Compared with the general population, EMS providers are at higher risk of contracting the SARS virus regardless of different perceived levels of risk. Standard protections and procedures for infection control should be strictly followed during transport and within the hospital environment.","Chow‐In Ko, Patrick; Chen, Wen‐Jone; Huei‐Ming Ma, Matthew; Chiang, Wen‐Chu; Su, Chan‐Ping; Huang, Chien‐Hua; Lu, Tsung‐Chien; Shih, Fuh‐Yuan; Lin, Fang‐Yue",Acad Emerg Med,292,16

Transpl Infect Dis 2011: 13: 448–455. xx: 000–000. All rights reserved Abstract: A simple clinical screening (CS) tool for respiratory virus (RV) infection was introduced and evaluated in a single hematology ward, as part of a strategy to reduce nosocomial RV infection. Up to 6 clinical symptoms or signs were scored and a predefined threshold score of ≥2 prompted paired nose/throat swab (NTS) collection for RV testing. The criterion standard for RV infection was positive immunofluorescence (IF) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for 7 and 15 viruses, respectively. The tool was shown to be most beneficial at excluding infection at a threshold score of 1 (negative predictive value [NPV] 89%, [95% confidence interval 78–96%], sensitivity 85% [70–94%], specificity 35% [27–43%]), compared with a score of 2 (NPV 85% [76–91%], sensitivity 63% [46–77%], specificity 57% [48–65%]) at a prevalence of 22%. The tool's ability to diagnose infection was limited (positive predictive value 27% and 29% at thresholds 1 and 2). The sensitivity of IF compared with PCR was 45% for the 7 viruses common to both, and 23% for the extended virus panel detected by PCR. An algorithm incorporating CS, paired NTS collection at a threshold of 1 symptom or sign, and sensitive testing including PCR can guide infection control measures in hospitalized hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients.","Ferguson, P.E.; Gilroy, N.M.; Sloots, T.P.; Nissen, M.D.; Dwyer, D.E.; Sorrell, T.C.",Transpl Infect Dis,292,16

Parents frequently administer the wrong dose of paracetamol by mistake for their children, as reported by many previous studies. We aimed in this study to assess parents’ knowledge, attitudes, and practice regarding paracetamol dosing and toxicity, as well as their awareness regarding paracetamol-containing products. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study that targeted parents of children seeking healthcare services at primary health care centers in the Nablus area in the West Bank, Palestine. We used questionnaire-based interviews with parents for data collection. RESULTS: A total of 300 parents were included in the study. Most of the caregivers surveyed were (87%) females (mothers). About half the parents (50.9%) reported previously using paracetamol as an antipyretic in children under the age of six. A quarter (25.4%) preferred the syrup forms, while 33.8% preferred the suppository dosage form. Medical personnel was the primary source of information for half the caregivers (51.2%). The mean knowledge score about paracetamol was 2.1 (SD = 1.4) out of 6, and the median was 2.0 with an interquartile range of 1.0–3.0. Two hundred seventy-four (95.5%) of the participants scored less than 80% and were considered to have insufficient knowledge. Only 50.9% of parents recognized that paracetamol overdose could result in serious harm. CONCLUSIONS: We found a serious lack of knowledge regarding paracetamol dosing, administration, and potential toxicity among Palestinian parents. We recommend raising awareness regarding this problem among healthcare providers and authorities and working on plans that aim to provide caregivers with accurate and adequate information on dosing, formulation, side effects, and other aspects of paracetamol use, as well as developing effective educational plans targeting healthcare providers, as well as the public.

Due to their underlying disease as well due to therapeutic immunosuppression, these patients may be at risk for a severe course of COVID-19 or for a flare of the underlying disease triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Demographic, clinical and treatment data from juvenile patients with RMD as well as data about SARS-CoV-2 infection like test date and method, clinical characteristics, disease course, outcome and impact on the disease activity of the RMD were documented on a specific SARS-CoV-2 questionnaire implemented in the National Paediatric Rheumatology Database (NPRD) in Germany. The survey data were analysed descriptively. RESULTS: From 17 April 2020 to 16 February 2021, data were collected from 76 patients (52% female) with RMD and laboratory-proven SARS-CoV-2 infection with median age of 14 years, diagnosed with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (58%), autoinflammatory (24%) and connective tissue disease (8%). Fifty-eight patients (76%) received disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), 41% biological DMARDs and 11% systemic glucocorticoids. Fifty-eight (76%) had symptoms of COVID-19. Disease course of SARS-CoV-2 infection (classified as asymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe, life-threatening) was mild and outcome of COVID-19 (classified as recovered, not yet recovered, permanent damage or deceased) was good (recovered) in the majority of patients. Two patients were hospitalised, one of whom required intensive care and died of cardiorespiratory failure. In 84% of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, no relevant increase in disease activity of the RMD was observed. CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, SARS-CoV-2 infection in juvenile patients with RMD under various medications was mild with good outcome in the majority of cases and does not appear to have a relevant impact on disease activity of the underlying condition.","Sengler, Claudia; Eulert, Sascha; Minden, Kirsten; Niewerth, Martina; Horneff, Gerd; Kuemmerle-Deschner, Jasmin; Siemer, Caroline; Berendes, Rainer; Girschick, Hermann; Hühn, Regina; Borte, Michael; Hospach, Anton; Emminger, Wolfgang; Armann, Jakob; Klein, Ariane; Kallinich, Tilmann",RMD Open,292,20

This study aimed to identify the degree of satisfaction in patients who benefit from medical recuperation services in one private clinic from Romania and the factors that played a part in this respect. Method: An online questionnaire was completed by 105 patients of a private clinic in the period immediately following the opening of the clinic after the quarantine period due to COVID-19. The following concepts were measured: general satisfaction with clinical recuperation services (SG), physician’s behavior (PB), the impact of interventions on the state of health (IHI), modern equipment (ME), and the intention to return to the clinic (IRC). Based on a linear regression model, the impact of PB, IHI, ME, and IRC variables on general satisfaction (SG) was established. Results: The study results confirm the data from studies carried out in different sociocultural contexts in ordinary time, where physician behavior is the most crucial factor in patients’ satisfaction. Therefore, we can say that the physiotherapist’s behavior has an essential role in determining the patients’ satisfaction both in ordinary time and in COVID-19 time. The data in this study reflect the fact that satisfaction with the services offered by a medical recuperation clinic is a predictor for using the services in the future. Still, our study reflects a moderate relationship in intensity.","Coman, Ecaterina; Diaconu, Alexandru; Mesesan Schmitz, Luiza; Repanovici, Angela; Baritz, Mihaela; Coman, Claudiu; Fotea, Silvia",Healthcare (Basel),292,16
