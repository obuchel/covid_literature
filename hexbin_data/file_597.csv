10473,Touch Me Not: Physical Distancing in Radiology during COVID-19,2020-04-22,"Sepsis is commonly known to affect neonatal outcomes. We assessed how much center-to-center variability of the sepsis rate affects the outcomes of very-low-birth-weight infants (VLBWIs). 7,493 VLBWIs registered in the Korean Neonatal Network from 2013 to 2016 were classified into three groups according to the sepsis rate: low sepsis group (LS) < 25(th) percentile versus intermediate sepsis group (IS) 25(th)–75(th) versus high sepsis group (HS) ≥ 75(th). The incidence density of sepsis for the LS, IS, and HS groups were 1.17, 3.17, and 8.88 cases/1,000 person-days. After propensity score matching was done for multiple antenatal and perinatal factors, the odds ratio of death, moderate to severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia and/or death, periventricular leukomalacia, and survival without major morbidities for the HS group were 2.0 (95% confidence interval 1.4–2.8), 1.9 (1.5–2.4), 1.5 (1.1–2.3) and 0.7 (0.5–0.8) when compared with the IS group, and 2.2 (1.6–3.2), 2.3 (1.8–2.9), 2.0 (1.3–2.9), and 0.7 (0.6–0.9) when compared with the LS group. There were no significant differences in those outcomes between the LS and IS groups. Hence, nationwide quality improvements to control the sepsis rate especially in units with a high sepsis rate will be helpful to improve the outcomes of VLBWIs.","Sung, Tae-Jung; Sohn, Jin A.; Oh, Sohee; Lee, Jin A.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7174287/,597
13346,The death rate for COVID-19 is positively associated with gross domestic products,2020-05-11,"Background Investment in pandemic preparedness is a long-term gamble, with the return on investment coming at an unknown point in the future. Many countries have chosen to stockpile key resources, and the number of pandemic economic evaluations has risen sharply since 2009. We assess the importance of uncertainty in time-to-pandemic (and associated discounting) in pandemic economic evaluation, a factor frequently neglected in the literature to-date. Methods We use a probability tree model and Monte Carlo parameter sampling to consider the cost effectiveness of antiviral stockpiling in Cambodia under parameter uncertainty. Mean elasticity and mutual information (MI) are used to assess the importance of time-to-pandemic compared with other parameters. We also consider the sensitivity to choice of sampling distribution used to model time-to-pandemic uncertainty. Results Time-to-pandemic and discount rate are the primary drivers of sensitivity and uncertainty in pandemic cost effectiveness models. Base case cost effectiveness of antiviral stockpiling ranged between is US$112 and US$3599 per DALY averted using historical pandemic intervals for time-to-pandemic. The mean elasticities for time-to-pandemic and discount rate were greater than all other parameters. Similarly, the MI scores for time to pandemic and discount rate were greater than other parameters. Time-to-pandemic and discount rate were key drivers of uncertainty in cost-effectiveness results regardless of time-to-pandemic sampling distribution choice. Conclusions Time-to-pandemic assumptions can “substantially” affect cost-effectiveness results and, in our model, is a greater contributor to uncertainty in cost-effectiveness results than any other parameter. We strongly recommend that cost-effectiveness models include probabilistic analysis of time-to-pandemic uncertainty.","Drake, Tom; Chalabi, Zaid; Coker, Richard",Health Policy Plan,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7574603/,597

17266,The Virtual International Day of the Midwife: A model for digital knowledge translation,2021-05-03,"ABSTRACT: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is emerging in Cameroon and represents one of the most common causes of acute hepatitis and jaundice. Moreover, earlier reports showed evidence of falciparum malaria/HEVcoexistence. Although the Sofosbuvir/Ribavirin combination was recently proposed in the treatment of HEV-infected patients, no specific antiviral drug has been approved so far, thereby urging the search for new therapies. Fortunately, drug repurposing offers a good alternative to this end. In this study, we report the in silico and in vitro activities of 8 licensed antimalarial drugs and two anti-hepatitis C virus agents used as references (Sofosbuvir, and Ribavirin), for repurposing as antiviral inhibitors against HEV. Compounds were docked against five HEV-specific targets including the Zinc-binding non-structural protein (6NU9), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), cryoEM structure of HEV VLP, genotype 1 (6LAT), capsid protein ORF-2, genotype 3 (2ZTN), and the E2s domain of genotype 1 (3GGQ) using the iGEMDOCK software and their pharmacokinetic profiles and toxicities were predicted using ADMETlab2.0. Their in vitro effects were also assessed on a gt 3 p6Gluc replicon system using the luciferase reporter assay. The docking results showed that Sofosbuvir had the best binding affinities with 6NU9 (− 98.22 kcal/mol), RdRp (− 113.86 kcal/mol), 2ZTN (− 106.96 kcal/mol), while Ribavirin better collided with 6LAT (− 99.33 kcal/mol). Interestingly, Lumefantrine showed the best affinity with 3GGQ (-106.05 kcal/mol). N-desethylamodiaquine and Amodiaquine presented higher binding scores with 6NU9 (− 93.5 and − 89.9 kcal/mol respectively vs − 80.83 kcal/mol), while Lumefantrine had the greatest energies with RdRp (− 102 vs − 84.58), and Pyrimethamine and N-desethylamodiaquine had stronger affinities with 2ZTN compared to Ribavirin (− 105.17 and − 102.65 kcal/mol vs − 96.04 kcal/mol). The biological screening demonstrated a significant (P < 0.001) antiviral effect on replication with 1 µM N-desethylamodiaquine, the major metabolite of Amodiaquine. However, Lumefantrine showed no effect at the tested concentrations (1, 5, and 10 µM). The biocomputational analysis of the pharmacokinetic profile of both drugs revealed a low permeability of Lumefantrine and a specific inactivation by CYP3A2 which might partly contribute to the short half-time of this drug. In conclusion, Amodiaquine and Lumefantrine may be good antimalarial drug candidates for repurposing against HEV. Further in vitro and in vivo experiments are necessary to validate these predictions.

A Preliminary Experimental Study,2021-04-29,"In this study, we evaluated stand status, dendrometric variables, and fruit production of Tamarind (Tamarindus indica L.) trees growing in bushland and farmland-use types in dryland areas of Ethiopia. The vegetation survey was conducted using the point-centered quarter method. The fruit yield of 54 trees was also evaluated. Tree density and fruit production in ha were estimated. There was a significant difference in Tamarind tree density between the two land-use types (p = 0.01). The mean fruit yield of farmland trees was significantly higher than that of bushland trees. However, Tamarind has unsustainable structure on farmlands. Differences in the dendrometric characteristics of trees were also observed between the two land-use types. Predictive models were selected for Tamarind fruit yield estimations in both land-use types. Although the majority of farmland trees produced <5000 fruit year(−1), the selection of Tamarind germplasm in its natural ranges could improve production. Thus, the development of management plans to establish stands that have a more balanced diameter structure and thereby ensure continuity of the population and fruit yields is required in this area, particularly in the farmlands. This baseline information could assist elsewhere in areas that are facing similar challenges for the species due to land-use change.","Zeleke, Gizachew; Dejene, Tatek; Tadesse, Wubalem; Martín-Pinto, Pablo",Life (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8146112/,597

In order to account for novel modifications, we need to search all the spectra against all the peptides using a joint probabilistic model that can be learned from training data. Assuming M spectra and N possible peptides, currently the state of the art search methods have runtime of O(MN). Here, we propose a novel bucketing method that sends pairs with high likelihood under the joint probabilistic model to the same bucket with higher probability than those pairs with low likelihood. We demonstrate that the runtime of this method grows sub-linearly with the data size, and our results show that our method is orders of magnitude faster than methods from the locality sensitive hashing literature.

41694,Strengthening immunity through healthy lifestyle practices: Recommendations for lifestyle interventions in the management of COVID‐19,2020-10-03,"This paper describes the adaptation of a flipped Biomedical Electronics course with laboratories to remote learning at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. In class collaborative work on problem sets was replaced by group work (4–5 students) in Zoom breakout sessions. When the groups assembled at random for each class had sufficiently progressed on a problem, a detailed solution was typed on the Multisim circuit simulator desktop (National Instruments) shared on the instructor screen. A laboratory project dealing with the development of an electromyograph (EMG) was redesigned for in-depth exploration of each circuit block composing the EMG circuit that was only feasible with the circuit simulator. The students progressed through the remote section of the course at the same rate as they had in the physical classroom in prior years. Student pairs finished a more complete virtual EMG laboratory project without being hampered by manipulation errors that are typical of novices when assembling hardware circuits. We conclude that a flipped biomedical electronics course can successfully be offered remotely and that virtual electronics laboratories that make use of a circuit simulator can provide a complete and meaningful learning experience.

IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON THERAPY PROVISION FOR CHILDREN WITH CNS TUMOURS,2020-12-04,"[Image: see text] Gut metabolism of natural products is of great interest due to the altered biological activity of the metabolites. To study the gut metabolism of the dietary furanocoumarins, the biotransformation of Angelica dahurica was studied with human gut microbiota. The major components of Avenula dahurica, including xanthotoxin (1), bergapten (2), imperatorin (3), isoimperatorin (4), oxypeucedanin (5), and byakangelicol (6), were all metabolized by the human fecal sample, and each furanocoumarin was also biotransformed by Blautia sp. MRG-PMF1 responsible for intestinal O-demethylation. Oxypeucedanin (5) and byakangelicol (6) were converted to oxypeucedanin hydrate (9) and desmethylbyakangelicin (12), respectively. The gut microbial conversion of xanthotoxin (1) and bergapten (2) with the MRG-PMF1 strain resulted in the production of xanthotoxol (7) and bergaptol (8), respectively, due to the methyl aryl ether cleavage by O-methyltransferase. Unexpectedly, the biotransformation of prenylated furanocoumarins, imperatorin (3), and isoimperatorin (4) resulted in the corresponding deprenylated furanocoumarins of xanthotoxol (7) and bergaptol (8), respectively. The cleavage of the prenyl aryl ether group by gut microbiota was unprecedented metabolism. Our data presented the first deprenylation of prenylated natural products, presumably by the anaerobic prenyl aryl ether cleavage reaction catalyzed by Co-corrinoid enzyme.","Tan, Steven Ryan Susanto; Eser, Bekir E.; Han, Jaehong",ACS Omega,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7711939/,597
43529,Digitalising diabetes support groups in response to the coronavirus COVID‐19 outbreak: a collaborative initiative,2020-11-30,"A local community space in Japan, Chiki Kastudokan, has been hosting several senior-to-senior social activities for community-dwelling older adults with support from the University of Tokyo. The activities are aimed at fostering communication and social engagement through exercise, music, cafe, and craft. After the emergence of COVID-19 pandemic, these activities have been disrupted. We conducted a questionnaire survey between June and July 2020 to assess how the pandemic has affected 26 activities and identify support needs that can enable their continuity amid the pandemic (response rate: 77%). First, all 26 activities were suspended by the onset of COVID-19. Hosts of 8 (40%) activities devised alternative ways to engage participants at home. For instance, hosts of craft activities arranged and sent to participants crafting kits. Limited capacity in using online platforms like Skype or Zoom prevented virtual interaction of hosts and participants. Notably, hosts were anxious towards resuming activities amid the pandemic. They worried about their health (50%), of being criticized by friends and family(25%), and of infections spreading among participants (85%). Hosts wanted strategies to prevent infections during activities, and easy to understand infection prevention guidelines for participants. These findings reveal that COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected senior-to-senior activities at Chiki Kastudokan. The University of Tokyo could help hosts identify effective infection prevention strategies to use when hosting activities amid the pandemic. It could also provide ICT training to hosts and participants to enhance their capacity in using online platforms in case of future waves of COVID-19.","Kazembe, Neo; Kim, Hongjik; Wang, Cong; Higuma, Shuichiro; Yang, Yerim; Kim, Taeeun; Ogino, Ryogo; Takase, Mai",Innov Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7741600/,597

Due to the pandemic, two in-person RCT weight-loss interventions in obese older adults with prediabetes, Veterans Achieving Weight Loss and Optimizing Resilience-Using Protein (VALOR-UP, n=12) and the Egg-Supplemented Pre-Diabetes Intervention Trial (EGGSPDITE, n=7), were converted to remote formats and weekly nutrition (EGGSPDITE and VALOR-UP) and exercise (VALOR-UP only) classes were delivered using synchronous videoconference technology (Webex); classes were accessed via tablet/desktop/laptop or smart phone. Steps taken to transition participants to remote formats included technology training, implementation of staff tech-support, and delivery of nutrition education, tablets, scales, and exercise bands. The time to successfully transition participants was 1 week for early adopters (n=10) and up to 4 weeks for those with significant technology barriers (n=9); their difficulties included internet access, camera and microphone access and use, and electronic submission of weight and food records. Even with these challenges, in the first 3 months of remote delivery, participant dropout rate was low (10.5%, n=2), attendance was high (87.6% nutrition class (n=19); 76.4% exercise class (VALOR-UP, n=12)), and weight loss was successful (>2.5% loss (n=13); >5% loss (n=8)), showing that lifestyle interventions can be successfully adapted for remote delivery. Remote interventions also have potential for use in non-pandemic times to reach underserved populations who often have high drop-out rates due to caretaker roles, transportation limitations, and work schedules. These barriers were significantly reduced using a virtual intervention platform.","Rincker, Jamie; Wallis, Jessica; Fruik, Angela; King, Alyssa; Young, Kenlyn; Tucker, Thoma; Bales, Connie; Starr, Kathryn Porter",Innov Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7741727/,597
43636,COVID-19 testing capabilities at urgent care centers in states with greatest disease burden,2020-11-16,"OBJECTIVES. Present methodology for the concurrent development of quantitative targets that reflect improvement in the national average of an indicator for Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG3), as well as a reduction in geographic inequality. METHODS. A five-step algorithm was developed: a) calculate the national average annual percentage change (AAPC) for an SDG3 indicator; b) standardize the definition of geographic strata based on subnational distribution of the indicator in a base year; c) apply a criterion for proportional progress in the AAPC in order to project the stratum-specific indicator to the target year; d) set the national target as the weighted average of the indicator in the subnational territorial units for the target year; and e) develop inequality reduction targets by calculating absolute and relative gaps between the top and bottom strata for the target year. RESULTS. The algorithm was applied to SDG indicator 3.1.1 (maternal mortality ratio, MMR), disaggregated by Guatemala’s 22 departments for base year 2014 (MMR = 113/100,000 live births). By sustaining the average AAPC rate attained from 2009 to 2014 (-4.3%) and targeting its actions to territorial progress, the country would reduce its MMR to 53/100,000 by 2030 and its absolute and relative gaps by 72% and 48%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS. The proposed methodology makes it possible to concurrently develop targets for the reduction of geographic inequalities in health and improvements in the national average, with explicit reference to the primacy of the principle of equity expressed in the SDGs’ commitment to leaving no one behind, whose urgency is newly important in the current post-pandemic scenario.","Sanhueza, Antonio; Espinosa, Isabel; Mújica, Oscar J.; da Silva, Jarbas Barbosa",Rev Panam Salud Publica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7748297/,597

To this end we have combined clinically salient CT imaging data synergistically with laboratory testing data in an integrative machine learning model to predict organ-specific recovery of patients from COVID-19. We trained and validated our model in 285 patients on each separate major organ system impacted by COVID-19 including the renal, pulmonary, immune, cardiac, and hepatic systems. To greatly enhance the speed and utility of our model, we applied an artificial intelligence method to segment and classify regions on CT imaging, from which interpretable data could be directly fed into the predictive machine learning model for overall recovery. Across all organ systems we achieved validation set area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) values for organ-specific recovery ranging from 0.80 to 0.89, and significant overall recovery prediction in Kaplan-Meier analyses. This demonstrates that the synergistic use of an AI framework applied to CT lung imaging and a machine learning model that integrates laboratory test data with imaging data can accurately predict the overall recovery of COVID-19 patients from baseline characteristics.","Wang, Winston T; Zhang, Charlotte L; Wei, Kang; Sang, Ye; Shen, Jun; Wang, Guangyu; Lozano, Alexander X",Precis Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7798573/,597

The relevance of collaborative work(),2021-02-19,"In 1971, Basil Bernstein presented his thesis on the packaging and distribution of educational knowledge, a curricular arrangement in which its classification and framing into disciplinary categories benefited those within the hierarchical structures. In the 50 years since Bernstein’s proposition, there has been a growing awareness and rejection of such disciplinary approaches in favour of integrating curricular knowledge across disciplines, not only through areas of science, math, and technology, but also across all school subjects, whereas Bernstein, and a certain strand of literature building on Bernstein’s thesis, asked why and who benefits from curriculum framing, a parallel strand in the curriculum integration literature. In the following article, we re-visit Bernstein’s hypothesis by examining selected interests involved in curriculum framing, but here, we specifically investigate who stands to gain when curriculum is integrated. From an extensive and persistent literature review, analysis, and collegial discussion, we cluster support of curriculum integration into six broad categories, scrutinizing each according to their major premise, aims of education, main curriculum interest(s), understanding of knowledge, and key supporters for each. We then extend this analysis by examining what interests are most salient, where and how these interests overlap, and where support for particular forms of curricular packaging is conspicuously silent. In our synthesis, we highlight a “Worldly Perspective” to curriculum delivery, an approach with potential to both deepen and broaden student learning, and which, unlike a singular disciplinary or integrated approach, is not similarly beholden to narrow interests.","Pluim, Gary; Nazir, Joanne; Wallace, John",Can,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7883883/,597

To ensure continuous current operation at the shoot through mode of grid connected inverter, a switched Z-source converter is utilized at the PV side. The PWM rectifier connected with the wind turbine transforms AC power into dc. Individual power converters with conventional PI controllers have been dedicated for each power source, and control strategy uses only one reference voltage so as to increase the maximum power tracking speed from both PV and wind sources. The battery energy management is performed by artificial neural network (ANN) to enhance the stable power flow and increase the lifespan of the storage system. Finally, the voltage at the point of common coupling is fed to ANN-based space vector-modulated three-phase inverter and the converted AC power is injected to the grid. The overall system performance is measured by estimating the quality of injected power. A stable operation of the proposed microgrid system is verified by varying input and load at the grid. A continuous-time simulation model is realized in MATLAB and is validated using experimental prototype.

Then the appropriation of the benefits of fossil fuels and of the atmospheric commons as a carbon dioxide dump by affluent groups and countries are investigated. Adverse consequences of the resulting global warming are carried by the medium of the environment to victims in distant locations excluded from benefits. Fossil-fuelled practices of the present generation, disproportionately by some, resulting in climate change also threaten to exclude future generations and other species from nature’s services, resources, and opportunities. The purposeful response from impact scientists and social movements, and the forceful reaction by nature’s dynamics, are studied. All this constitutes environmental social closure.

The dual principle, used for showing that an element is above the least fixpoint, is related to inductive invariants. In this paper we provide proof rules which are similar in spirit but for showing that an element is above the greatest fixpoint or, dually, below the least fixpoint. The theory is developed for non-expansive monotone functions on suitable lattices of the form [Formula: see text] , where Y is a finite set and [Formula: see text] an MV-algebra, and it is based on the construction of (finitary) approximations of the original functions. We show that our theory applies to a wide range of examples, including termination probabilities, behavioural distances for probabilistic automata and bisimilarity.

This article explores how school social workers’ roles, responsibilities, and work tasks shifted during spring 2020 distance learning to address the continuing and changing needs of families and the larger school community. Interviews were conducted with 20 school social workers in K–12 public schools, across three states, to understand the primary needs of children and families during the pandemic and to learn how school social workers can be most effective in responding to these needs. The data were analyzed using a grounded theory approach. Study findings revealed that during spring 2020, school social workers consistently had increased contact and interaction with students’ parents that centered around two major activities: (1) food assistance and referrals for families and (2) parent check-ins and coaching. The article discusses implications for the field of school social work during crises and beyond. Considerations include increased funding for schools that serve communities disproportionately affected by the pandemic and the reprioritization of school social workers’ roles and responsibilities to include increased contact with parents.","Daftary, Ashley-Marie H; Sugrue, Erin P; Gustman, Brian D; Lechuga-Peña, Stephanie",Child Sch,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8083265/,597
52383,Impact of Covid-19 Lockdown Measures on Lifestyle Behavior in Children and Adolescents With Severe Obesity,2021-05-03,"INTRODUCTION: As a verified burn center, we prepare for mass casualty & constantly strive to remain at the forefront of the burn technology & research. There was nothing that prepared us for a statewide stay-at-home order nor the hospital lockdown that would come with the coronavirus pandemic. The hospital lockdowns resulted in disheartening loneliness that would prohibit the visitation of family to the ill or injured patients. The difficulty of locking down well parents proved challenging. Our new hospital policy restricted parent movements & their anxiety of exposure also heightened the desire to discharge. We questioned whether the peds patient was better suited in the hospital or at home. This shifted our usual practice. During March-May, our hospital restricted parent movements out of the patient’s room, no visitors, no swap outs during the day. This resulted in early debridements, often at the bedside, & application of the polylactic acid polymer substitute. This allowed for a discharge within 24 hrs & return to clinic in 48 hrs. METHODS: We reviewed the charts of 10 pediatric patients that normally would have remained hospitalized pre-COVID & these patients were admitted underwent debridement & early application of a polylactic acid polymer skin substitute. The charts were reviewed to determine if there were any readmissions, ER visits, delays in wound healing, delays in OR time, if needed, opposition from parents or nurses from about readiness for discharge. RESULTS: The charts indicated there was one return admission. The readmit was from a planned split thickness skin graft & the polylactic acid polymer was used to stage the deeper area while allowing the majority to heal. Charts demonstrated satisfaction of the parents that didn’t want to be in the hospital during COVID. No nurses felt uncomfortable & all patients demonstrated stable vitals & good UOP at the time of discharge. This indicates several initial application on admission & was discharged within 24 hours. CONCLUSIONS: This could at face value be a simple means to an end. The review of records indicates this was successful by most definitions of outcome. The limitation discovered was the ability to optimize outpatient therapy. Burns in the time of COVID, made use reexamine how we have cared for burns & whether there was room to perform more without an inpatient or a decreased inpatient stay. This change in practice also illustrated the ability to the wounds we initially thought may be deeper & possibly need excision actually healed well with no current development of hypertrophic scarring. Our institution will consider the early practice of debridement & lactic acid polymer application even when the restriction are eased. It also forced us to reevaluate how much we are grafting & reexamine what can heal on its own.","Short, Tracee",J Burn Care Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8083592/,597

52752,Fr100 TELEMEDICINE IN GASTROENTEROLOGY: A STUDY ON FEASIBILITY AND PATIENTS’ TRUST DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC.,2021-05-10,"Introduction: Several demographic and clinical characteristics, including age, low socioeconomic status, and misdiagnosis at initial clinical presentation were previously associated with increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at diagnosis of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in the pediatric population. However, it is unclear whether the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and subsequent lockdown influenced the rate of DKA in children newly diagnosed with T1D. We undertook this study to identify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the rate of DKA in children newly diagnosed with T1D in a single tertiary care referral center in central Pennsylvania. Methods: We performed an extension of a retrospective analysis of all pediatric patients (age ≤18) newly diagnosed with T1D within a tertiary care referral center between 01/01/2017-09/14/2020. Demographics, insurance coverage, and all clinical documents 30 days before their T1D diagnosis were abstracted to assess for symptoms at diagnosis (polyuria, polydipsia, nocturia, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, altered mental status, infection, vision changes, and autism spectrum disorder), lab values (blood glucose, HbA(1c), venous pH, and bicarbonate), and any healthcare encounters within 30 days of their diagnosis of T1D. We performed descriptive statistics and univariate analyses [evaluating children diagnosed with T1D during the pre-COVID-19 era (diagnosed between 1/1/2017-2/28/2020) and post-COVID-19 era (diagnosed between 03/01/2020-09/14/2020) associated with the incidence of DKA], followed by logistic regression analysis (incorporating key clinical factors previously associated with DKA and the pre- or post- COVID-19 era classification). Results: 412 pediatric patients with T1D [171 F:241 M; 370 pre-COVID-19 era:42 post-COVID-19 era] were included. The percentages of DKA diagnoses at admission were very similar between the pre-COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 groups (47% vs. 48%), as were the severity (13% vs. 14% mild DKA; 33% vs. 31% moderate or severe DKA). There were no temporal associations with the rate of DKA in respect to COVID-19, however, age (0-3 and 9-13 years), misdiagnosis during a preceding healthcare encounter, presenting to the emergency department directly, elevated HbA(1c) (>10.0%/13.4mmol/L), and altered mental status were associated with increased risk of DKA on multivariable analysis. Conclusion: There were no fluctuations in the rate of DKA among pediatric patients newly diagnosed with T1D throughout the COVID-19 pandemic in central Pennsylvania. Interestingly, some geographic locations observed an increased frequency of DKA in children newly diagnosed with T1D, while others noted a decreased rate. Regardless, our findings suggest previously described predictors of DKA in the pediatric population persist, even in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bogale, Kaleb T; Urban, Valerie; Schaefer, Eric; Krishna, Kanthi Bangalore",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8090689/,597
53099,P032 Increased incidence of anti-synthetase syndrome during COVID-19 pandemic,2021-04-26,"Weather variables are one of the crucial factors affecting respiratory infectious diseases; however, the effect of weather variables on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still inconclusive and varies in different regions. The present study investigated the effects of weather variables (maximum temperature, MT; relative humidity, RH; wind speed, WS; precipitation, PR; and dew point, DP) on daily infection and death cases in three lockdown phases in Asia as of November 1, 2020. Generalized additive lag model was used to analyze the risk associated with weather variables, with confounders like median age of the national population, population density, country and lockdown phases. Our findings revealed that during lockdown phases all five weather variables show association with daily confirmed, and death cases. On the other hand, PR (pre-lockdown phase) and DP (lockdown phase) showed positive association with both daily confirmed and death cases. Throughout the three lockdown phases MT, RH and PR showed strong positive associations with daily confimed/death cases. A lag period of 0–4-days possess higher risk of infection and death due to the varied ratios of different weather variables. The relative risk indicated that the infection and mortality risk was higher in India as compared to the rest of the countries. Here, unique combination of weather variables together with higher population density makes this region as one of the hotspots for COVID-19. This shows that the COVID-19 pandemic may be suppressed or enhanced with combination of different weather conditions together with factors like population density and median age of the country, which shall be useful for better implementation of health policies and further preparedness in Asia.

53305,537 Implications of Covid-19 on Vitreoretinal and Cataract Surgery,2021-05-04,"Background/Aims Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytos (HLH) is a potentially life-threatening condition characterised by over-activation of the innate immune system. It can be classified into primary HLH, often inherited, or secondary which is triggered by non-genetic causes, such as chronic immunosuppression, malignancy or infection.Primary HLH is more frequently observed in infants, however, secondary HLH is more commonly observed in adults. Diagnosis is often delayed, most likely due to the rarity of the condition and is usually prompted by serological abnormalities, including hyperferritinaemia, organ and bone marrow dysfunction.Treatment options are limited; however, the Royal Free Hospital has observed a number of secondary HLH cases who were successfully treated with steroids and anakinra. Methods A retrospective search of clinic letters and patient records was undertaken using electronic care records. We also searched through pharmacy records of patients treated with anakinra at the Royal Free Hospital. Patients with a documented diagnosis of HLH prior to March 2020 who had been referred to Rheumatology were included. We excluded patients after March 2020 due to patients with COVID-19 having similar overlap of symptoms and biomarkers as those with HLH. We identified key demographic details, laboratory, pathology investigations,the course of hospital admission, primary diagnosis and follow-up data. The diagnosis was confirmed withan H-score and bone marrow biopsy where possible. Results We identified nine adult cases with adocumented diagnosis of HLH whohad been admitted to the Royal Free Hospitaland referred to Rheumatology. They had allbeen subsequently followed up in outpatientclinic.Ages of patients ranged from 19 to 58 with a male to female ratio of 2:1. The predominant underlying pathology was adultonsetStill’s disease(78%), with the remaining cases being secondary to HIV (22%). Bone marrow aspirate was performed in all patients and 78% of patients aspirated had bone marrowappearances in keeping with HLH.Ferritin levels varied from 532 micrograms/Lto 93309 micrograms/L with a median ferritin of 5045.5 micrograms/L.H-Scores were variable witha median score of 171.5 (96-238).All patients received steroids as part of their treatment. Anakinra (interleukin-1 receptor antagonist) was delivered intravenously(6/9) or subcutaneously (3/9). Conclusion We present data from nine cases of HLH treated with anakinra who survived their admission and have been subsequently followed up in clinic. We found that the majority of these patients had an underlying diagnosis of adult onset Still’s disease. Anakinra was used successfully as part of their treatment both intravenously as well as subcutaneously. Further work is needed comparing patients with good and poor outcomes to establish identifiable prognostic markers as well as effective treatment strategies. Disclosure D. Kurzeja: None. J.

In particular, 342 PD patients were subjected to a genotyping analysis of a panel of 120 SNPs by Open Array Technology. As control group, 503 samples representative of the European general population were utilized. The genetic analysis identified 26 SNPs associated with PD susceptibility. Of them, 12 SNPs were described as significant expression Quantitative Loci (eQTL) variants in different brain regions associated with motor and non-motor PD phenomenology. Moreover, the study highlighted 11 novel susceptibility genes for PD, which may alter multiple signaling pathways critically involved in peripheral immune response, neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration and dopaminergic neurons wiring. The study of miRNA-target genes highlighted a possible role of miR-499a, miR-196a2, and miR-29a in the modulation of multiple neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative mechanisms underlying PD physiopathology. The study described a network of interconnected genes (APOE, CLU, IL6, IL7R, IL12B, INPP5D, MAPK1, MEF2C, MIF, and TNFSF14), which may act as upstream regulators in the modulation of biological pathways relevant to PD. Intriguingly, IL6 stands out as a master gene regulator since it may indirectly regulate the network of interconnected genes. The study highlighted different genes and miRNAs interactions potentially involved in PD physiopathology, which are worth to be further explored to improve the knowledge of disease and the research of novel treatments strategies.","Strafella, Claudia; Caputo, Valerio; Termine, Andrea; Assogna, Francesca; Pellicano, Clelia; Pontieri, Francesco E.; Macchiusi, Lucia; Minozzi, Giulietta; Gambardella, Stefano; Centonze, Diego; Bossù, Paola; Spalletta, Gianfranco; Caltagirone, Carlo; Giardina, Emiliano; Cascella, Raffaella",Front Genet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8209518/,597

The prepared series constitutes three members that differ from each other by the terminally attached alkoxy chain group, these vary between 6 and 12 carbons. A laterally OCH(3) group is incorporated into the central benzene ring in meta position with respect to the ester moiety. Mesomorphic characterizations of the prepared derivatives are conducted using differential scanning-calorimetry (DSC), polarized optical-microscopy (POM). Molecular structures were elucidated by elemental analyses and NMR spectroscopy. DSC and POM investigations revealed that all the synthesized derivatives are purely nematogenic exhibiting only nematic (N) mesophase, except for the longest chain derivative (I-12) that is dimorphic possesses smectic A and N phases. Moreover, all members of the group have a wide mesomorphic range with high thermal nematic stability. A comparative study was established between the present derivative (I-6) and their previously prepared isomer. The results indicated that the location exchange of the polar compact group (CH(3)) influences the N mesophase stability and range. The electrical measurements revealed that all synthesized series I-n show Ohmic behaviors with effective electric resistances in the GΩ range. Under white light illumination, the effective electric conductivity for the compound I-8 is five times that obtained in dark conditions. This derivative also showed two direct optical band gaps in the UV and visible light range. In addition, I-6 has band energy gaps of values 1.07 and 2.79 eV, which are suitable for solar energy applications.","Alamro, Fowzia S.; Gomha, Sobhi M.; Shaban, Mohamed; Altowyan, Abeer S.; Abolibda, Tariq Z.; Ahmed, Hoda A.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8298406/,597

Efforts to tackle one issue can support or hinder progress towards others, often with complex systemic interactions. Thus, each of the SDGs and their corresponding targets may contribute as levers or hurdles towards achieving other SDGs and targets. Based on SDG indicator data, we create a systems model considering influence among the SDGs and their targets. Once assessed within a system, we find that more SDGs and their corresponding targets act as levers towards achieving other goals and targets rather than as hurdles. In particular, efforts towards SDGs 5 (Gender Equality) and 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) may accelerate progress, while SDGs 10 (Reduced Inequalities) and 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions) are shown to create potential hurdles.

59887,"'It was difficult, but our struggle to touch lives gave us strength': The experience of nurses working in COVID-19 wards.",2020-12-15,"INTRODUCTION There is increasing concern among hospital personnel about potential secondary exposure when treating chemically contaminated patients. OBJECTIVE To assess which circumstances and chemicals require the use of Level C Personal Protective Equipment (chemical splash suit and air-purifying respirator), to prevent secondary contamination of hospital personnel treating a chemically contaminated patient. METHODS The US National Library of Medicine PubMed database was searched for the years 1985 to 2020 utilizing combinations of relevant search terms. This yielded 557 papers which were reviewed by title and abstract. After excluding papers on biological or radiological agents, or those not related to hospital personnel, 38 papers on chemicals remained. After a full-text review, 13 papers without an in-depth discussion on the risk for secondary contamination were omitted, leaving 25 papers for review. The references of these papers were searched and this yielded another seven additional citations, bringing the total to 32 papers. INCIDENCE OF SECONDARY TOXICITY Secondary toxicity in hospital personnel is rare: a large-scale inventory of 120,000 chemical incidents identified only nine cases, an occurrence of 0.0075%. SKIN CONTACT AS A SECONDARY EXPOSURE ROUTE Skin exposure is rare under normal hygienic working conditions, reflected by the very small number of cases reported in the literature: two cases with corrosive effects due to unprotected contact and one case of presumed skin absorption. INHALATION AS A SECONDARY EXPOSURE ROUTE Most case reports described secondary toxicity as a result of inhalation. The chemicals involved were irritating solid particles (capsaicin spray/CS), toxic gases formed in the stomach of patients (arsine/hydrazoic acid/phosphine) and vapours from volatile liquids (solvents). FEATURES OF SECONDARY TOXICITY Reported symptoms after secondary inhalation were generally mild and reversible (mostly irritation of eyes and respiratory tract, nausea, headache, dizziness/light-headedness) and did not require treatment. In many cases, special circumstances increased exposure: treatment/decontamination of multiple patients, regurgitation of the chemical agent from the stomach, or inadequate room ventilation. USE OF MORE THAN STANDARD PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT Normal hygienic precautions prevent direct skin contact from exposure to common chemical agents. When solid particle contamination is extensive, a mask and eye protection should be applied. Splash proof outer clothing (splash suit) and eye protection is preferred if (partial) wet decontamination is performed on single patients. Adequate ventilation, careful removal of clothing in case of solid particles contamination and adequate disposal of gastric content reduces exposure. Hospital staff can be rotated if symptoms occur, which can be odour-mediated. The use of more elaborate personal protective equipment with an air-purifying respirator (Level C) is only necessary in exceptional cases of contamination with highly toxic volatile chemicals (e.g., sarin). It should also be considered when decontaminating a large number of patients. CONCLUSIONS The risk of secondary contamination and subsequent toxicity in hospital personnel decontaminating or treating chemically contaminated patients is small. Normal hygienic precautions (gloves and water-resistant gown) will adequately protect hospital staff when treating the majority of chemically contaminated patients. More extensive protection is only necessary infrequently and there is no reason to delay critical care, even if more elaborate protection is not immediately available.","De Groot, Ronald; Van Zoelen, Gerard A; Leenders, Marianne E C; Van Riel, Antoinette J H P; De Vries, Irma; De Lange, Dylan W",Clinical toxicology,https://doi.org/10.1080/15563650.2020.1860216; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33448889/,597

METHODS Published literature on economic analyses of the NBCCEDP was systematically reviewed. The Consensus on Health Economic Criteria checklist was used to assess methodological quality of the included studies. RESULTS Methods available for economic analysis of public health programs include program cost, cost-effectiveness, cost-utility, cost-benefit analysis, and budget impact analysis. Of these, program cost analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis, and cost-utility analysis have been applied to the NBCCEDP in previously published literature. CONCLUSION While there have been multiple program cost analyses, there are relatively fewer cost-effectiveness and cost-utility studies and no cost-benefit and budget impact analysis studies to evaluate the NBCCEDP. Addressing these gaps will inform implementation of effective public health programs with equitable resource allocation to all population subgroups.","Khushalani, Jaya S; Trogdon, Justin G; Ekwueme, Donatus U; Yabroff, K Robin",Cancer causes & control : CCC,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10552-019-01235-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31598825/,597

The respondents were proposed to fill in remotely an anonymous questionnaire to evaluate the experience of prescribing medicines off-label to adult patients.Results Prescribing medicines not in consistence with the officially approved instruction for medical use (off-label or ""outside instruction"") is a relevant issue of global medical care since convincing scientific evidence for safety of such use is scarce. Analysis of information about off-label prescription is one of current tasks of national medical research centers according to the Federal Project ""Development of a network of national medical research centers and implementation of innovative medical technologies"". According to the responses about the frequency of off-label prescriptions 67.5 % of respondents reported of no experience of off-label prescription, 27.7 % said ""rarely"" or ""sometimes"", and 4.8 % said ""frequently"" and ""very frequently"". Specialties of physicians who have more often used medicines off-label (50% and more) included obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, rheumatology, hematology, and pulmonology. Cardiologists, neurologists and clinical pharmacologists use medicines off-label relatively rarely (19.6%, 28.6 %, and 22.2 %, respectively). 40 % of medicines used off-label were those designed for the treatment of coronavirus infection SARS-CoV-2. The medicines most frequently used off-label included metformin, rituximab, and thioctic acid. 65 % of respondents assessed their knowledge of off-label prescription as insufficient. In addition, 75 % of respondents consider it useful to receive additional information about risks and benefits of off-label prescription in clinical practice.Conclusion The survey revealed the need of physicians for information about risks of the off-label use of medicines in clinical practice.","Drapkina, O M; Shepel, R N; Martsevich, S Yu; Kutishenko, N P; Berns, S A; Bulgakova, E S; Orlov, D O; Belkin, I A",Kardiologiia,https://doi.org/10.18087/cardio.2021.5.n1510; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34112074/,597

Intrathyroid parathyroid adenoma (ITPA) is also rare. Co-ocurrence of PTC and ITPA in the same thyroid lobe is extremely rare. Likewise, primary hyperparathyroidism with such non-medullary thyroid carcinoma is rare. The specific molecular profile of hobnail PTC (HPTC) is different from the classic, poorly differentiated and anaplastic variants and may contribute to its aggressive behavior. HPTC's genetic profile remains unclear. PRESENTATION OF CASE A 61-year-old woman presented to our endocrine clinic with generalized aches, bone pain, polyuria, and right neck swelling of a few months' duration. Laboratory findings revealed hypercalcemia and hyperparathyroidism. Ultrasound of the neck showed 4.6 cm complex nodule within the right thyroid lobe. Sestamibi scan suggested parathyroid adenoma in the right thyroid lobe. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) revealed atypical follicular lesion of undetermined significance. She underwent right lobectomy, which normalized the intraoperative intact parathyroid hormone levels. Final pathology with immunohistochemical stains demonstrated HPTC and IPTA (2 cm each). Next-generation sequencing investigated the mutation spectrum of HPTC and detected BRAFV600E mutation. CONCLUSIONS A parathyroid adenoma should not exclude the diagnosis of thyroid carcinoma. Thyroid evaluation is needed for patients with primary hyperparathyroidism to prevent missing concurrent thyroid cancers. Cytomorphologic features to distinguish thyroid from parathyroid cells on FNA cytology must be considered. Immunohistochemical stains are important. BRAFV600E is the most common mutation in HPTC. This is possibly the first reported case of HPTC and ITPA co-occurring within the same thyroid lobe. Studies that define other molecular abnormalities may be useful as therapeutic targets.","Al-Yahri, Omer; Abdelaal, Abdelrahman; El Ansari, Walid; Farghaly, Hanan; Murshed, Khaled; Zirie, Mahmoud A; Al Hassan, Mohamed S",International journal of surgery case reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2020.04.025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408235/,597
61440,Building Resilience for Generations: The Tip of the Chromosome.,2021-02-01,"GP64, the major envelope glycoprotein of the Autographa californica multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus budded virion, is important for host cell receptor binding and mediates low-pH-triggered membrane fusion during entry by endocytosis. Previous transmembrane (TM) domain replacement studies showed that the TM domain serves a critical role in GP64 function. To extend the prior studies and examine specific sequence requirements of the TM domain, we generated a variety of GP64 TM domain mutations. The mutations included 4- to 8-amino-acid deletions, as well as single and multiple point mutations. While most TM domain deletion constructs remained fusion competent, those containing deletions of eight amino acids from the C terminus did not mediate detectable fusion. The addition of a hydrophobic amino acid (A, L, or V) to the C terminus of construct C8 (a construct that contains a TM domain deletion of eight amino acids from the C terminus) restored fusion activity. These data suggest that the membrane fusion function of GP64 is dependent on a critical length of the hydrophobic TM domain. All GP64 proteins with a truncated TM domain mediated detectable virion budding with dramatically lower levels of efficiency than wild-type GP64. The effects of deletions of various lengths and positions in the TM domain were also examined for their effects on viral infectivity. Further analysis of the TM domain by single amino acid substitutions and 3-alanine scanning mutations identified important but not essential amino acid positions. These studies showed that amino acids at positions 485 to 487 and 503 to 505 are important for cell surface expression of GP64, while amino acids at positions 483 to 484 and 494 to 496 are important for virus budding. Overall, our results show that specific features and amino acid sequences, particularly the length of the hydrophobic TM domain, play critical roles in membrane anchoring, membrane fusion, virus budding, and infectivity.","Li, Zhaofei; Blissard, Gary W",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02252-08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19244324/,597

Using computers for long hours is related to a higher risk of computer-related muscular disorders like forward head posture (FHP) and neck pain (NP). Deep cervical flexor (DCF) muscles are important head-on-neck posture stabilizers; thus, their training may lead to an improvement in FHP and NP. The aim of this study was to determine if 4 weeks of DCF training is effective in alleviating NP, improving FHP, and functional status in adolescent children using computers regularly, a pretest-posttest experimental group design was used. Subjects were randomly assigned into the experimental group (receiving DCF training and postural education) and the control group (receiving postural education only). 30 subjects with a mean age of 15.7 ± 1.725 years with NP and FHP using computers regularly participated in the study. Dependent variables were measured on day 1 (at baseline) and after 4 weeks of training. Photographic analysis was used for measuring FHP, visual analog scale for NP intensity, and neck disability index for functional status. Data analysis showed that in both groups, no significant improvement occurred in FHP. In both groups, there was a significant improvement in functional status and NP. There was no significant difference between both groups for FHP and NP. There was a significant improvement in functional status in the experimental group in comparison to the control group. Four weeks of DCF training does not cause a significant improvement in FHP in 13 to 18 years old adolescent children using computers regularly.","Sikka, Isha; Chawla, Chandan; Seth, Shveta; Alghadir, Ahmad H; Khan, Masood",BioMed research international,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/8327565; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33083487/,597

We placed the anodal electrode over the right motor region (C4) while the cathodal or return electrode was placed either over a left supraorbital region (unihemispheric montage) or over the left motor region (C3 in the bihemispheric montage). Performance changes in the finger sequence task for both hands (left hand: p = 0.0026, and right hand: p = 0.0002) showed a linear tDCS dose response but no montage effect. rCBF in the right hemispheric perirolandic area increased with dose under the anodal electrode (p = 0.027). In contrast, in the perirolandic ROI in the left hemisphere, rCBF showed a trend to increase with dose (p = 0.053) and a significant effect of montage (p = 0.00004). The bihemispheric montage showed additional rCBF increases in frontomesial regions in the 4mA condition but not in the 2mA condition. Furthermore, we found correlations between rCBF changes in the right perirolandic region and improvements in the finger sequence task performance (FSP) for the left and right hand. Our data support not only a strong direct tDCS dose effect for rCBF and FSP as surrogate measures of targeted brain regions but also indirect effects on rCBF in functionally connected regions (e.g., frontomesial regions), particularly in the higher dose condition and on FSP of the ipsilateral hand (to the anodal electrode). At a higher dose and irrespective of polarity, a wider network of sensorimotor regions is positively affected by tDCS.","Shinde, Anant B; Lerud, Karl D; Munsch, Fanny; Alsop, David C; Schlaug, Gottfried",NeuroImage,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118144; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33991697/,597

However, sex differences in knee-extensor fatigability remain relatively unexplored. PURPOSE To determine the sex difference in performance fatigability for intermittent, isometric contractions of the knee-extensor muscles. METHODS Eighteen participants (10 males, 8 females) performed intermittent, isometric, knee-extensor contractions at 30% of their maximal voluntary force (MVC) for 30min and in a separate session at 50% MVC until task-failure. During both fatiguing protocols a MVC was performed every 60s and electromyography (EMG) was recorded during all contractions. RESULTS At task completion males had a larger reduction in MVC force for the 30% MVC task (-32±15% vs. -15±16%, P=0.042) and the 50% MVC task (-34±8% vs. -24±1%, P=0.045). Furthermore, for the 50% MVC task, females had a longer task duration (937±525svs. 397±153s, P=0.007). The rise in EMG activity and force fluctuations were more rapid for the males than females (P<0.05). When participants were matched for strength post hoc (n=10), a sex difference in fatigability for both tasks was still evident. CONCLUSIONS Females were less fatigable than males during intermittent, isometric, knee-extensor contractions at moderate relative forces and this difference was independent of strength.","Ansdell, Paul; Thomas, Kevin; Howatson, Glyn; Hunter, Sandra; Goodall, Stuart",Journal of electromyography and kinesiology : official journal of the International Society of Electrophysiological Kinesiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jelekin.2017.09.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28963937/,597

The present study aimed to compare the inflammatory impact of classic video laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) versus LESS cholecystectomy. METHODS A prospective randomized controlled study was conducted from January to June 2011 at 2 university hospitals in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Fifty-seven patients (53 women, 4 men; mean age = 48.7 years) were randomly assigned to receive LC (n = 29) or LESS (n = 28) cholecystectomy. C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) were measured from blood samples collected during induction of anesthesia and at 3 and 24 hours postoperatively. RESULTS Median IL-6 levels in the LESS and LC groups, respectively, were 2.96 and 4.5 pg/mL preoperatively, 11.6 and 28.05 pg/mL at 3 hours postoperatively (P = .029), and 13.18 and 15.1 pg/mL at 24 hours postoperatively (P = .52). Median CRP levels in the LESS and LC groups, respectively, were 0.33 and 0.44 mg/mL preoperatively, 0.40 and 0.45 mg/mL (P = .73) at 3 hours postoperatively, and 1.7 and 1.82 mg/mL (P = .84) at 24 hours postoperatively. We did not find a significant association between IL-6 (and CRP) and body mass index in the LESS group. CONCLUSIONS LESS cholecystectomy requires a larger size incision than LC. We found a tendency of less postoperative pain following LESS cholecystectomy than LC. There was also a tendency toward lower early inflammatory impact following LESS cholecystectomy versus LC.","Madureira, Fernando Athayde Veloso; Manso, José Eduardo Ferreira; Madureira Filho, Delta; Iglesias, Antonio Carlos Garrido",Surgical innovation,https://doi.org/10.1177/1553350613499454; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23945842/,597
64265,Collecting Data About COVID-19-Related Brain Symptoms.,2021-02-23,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Flow diversion with intermediate-porosity stents (braided stents) has been recently reported for distally located small aneurysms. The aim of this study was to evaluate the flow-diversion effect of LEO stents on covered vessels and for aneurysms treated with sole stent-placement therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively evaluated the following outcomes: 1) remodeling of covered side branches and perforators (extra-aneurysmal flow remodeling), and 2) the occlusion rate of aneurysms treated with sole stent-placement therapy (intra-aneurysmal flow remodeling). RESULTS Seventy-six patients with 98 covered vessels were studied. Overall, 89 covered arteries (91%) were normal, 7 showed narrowing (7%), and 2 (2%) were occluded (1 posterior communicating artery and 1 MCA) without related complications (mean DSA follow-up, 14 months). Univariate and multivariate analyses highlighted smoking (P = .03) and the length of follow-up (P = .002) as factors associated with arterial remodeling. Of the 17 Sylvian (lenticulostriate arteries) and 7 basilar perforators, 1 (4%) group of Sylvian perforators covered with double stents had asymptomatic remodeling. Ten aneurysms (mean size, 3.5 mm) were treated with LEO stents as stent monotherapy (5 recanalized after coiling and 5 directly treated with the LEO). Complete occlusion (Raymond-Roy I) was achieved in 70% of aneurysms (mean follow-up, 14 months). The Raymond-Roy I occlusion rate among recanalized aneurysms and those directly treated with LEO stents was 80% and 60%, respectively (P = .9). CONCLUSIONS The rate of flow remodeling on the covered arteries and perforators was 9% and 4%, respectively, and was clinically irrelevant in all cases. Complete occlusion of aneurysms treated with sole stent-placement therapy was 70%. These data stress the flow-diversion properties of LEO stents.","Cagnazzo, F; Cappucci, M; Dargazanli, C; Lefevre, P-H; Gascou, G; Riquelme, C; Morganti, R; Mazzotti, V; Bonafe, A; Costalat, V",AJNR.

Twelve patients previously received 14 C-erythromycin intravenously pre- and post-hemodialysis. Serial breath samples were collected after each dose over two hours. Eight PBPK parameters were co-estimated across periods while activity of CYP3A4 clearance was independently estimated for each period. Inhibition coefficients for OATP, P-gp, and MRP2 activities were also estimated. Nonrenal clearance parameter estimates were explored regarding sex differences, correlations with uremic toxins, and used in hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). Relationships between the function of nonrenal clearance pathways and uremic toxin concentrations were explored. Mean CYP3A4 clearance increased by 2.2% post-hemodialysis. Uptake transporter activity was highly inter-variable across hemodialysis. Females had 22% and 30% higher median CYP3A4 activity than males pre- and post-hemodialysis, respectively. Exploratory HCA indicated that using both CYP3A4 and OATP activity parameters at pre- and post-HD best identifies heterogeneous patients. This is the first study to utilize the iPBPK-R approach to simultaneously estimate multiple in vivo nonrenal elimination pathways in individual patients with kidney disease and to assess the effect of hemodialysis.

However, it is not known whether intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) is of added benefit in patients undergoing MT. Objective To examine whether treatment with IVT before MT with a stent retriever is beneficial in patients undergoing MT. Design, Setting, and Participants This post hoc analysis used data from 291 patients treated with MT included in 2 large, multicenter, prospective clinical trials that evaluated MT for AIS (Solitaire With the Intention for Thrombectomy performed from January 1, 2010, through December 31, 2011, and Solitaire Flow Restoration Thrombectomy for Acute Revascularization from January 1, 2010, through December 31, 2012). An independent core laboratory scored the radiologic outcomes in each trial. Interventions Patients were treated with IVT with tissue plasminogen activator followed by MT (IVT and MT group) with the use of a stent retriever or MT with a stent retriever alone (MT group). Main Outcomes and Measures Successful reperfusion, functional independence (modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2) and mortality at 90 days, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, emboli to new territory, and vasospasm were compared. Results Of 291 patients included in the analysis, 160 (55.0%) underwent IVT and MT (mean [SD] age, 67 [13] years; 97 female [60.6%]), and 131 (45.0%) underwent MT alone (mean [SD] age, 69 [12] years; 71 [55.7%] female). Median Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score at baseline was lower in the IVT and MT group (8 vs 9, P = .04). There was no statistically significant difference in the duration from symptom onset to groin puncture (254 minutes for the IVT and MT group vs 262 minutes for the MT group, P = .10). The number of passes, rate of successful reperfusion, functional independence at 90 days, mortality at 90 days, and emboli to new territory were also similar among groups. Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (1% vs 4%) and parenchymal hemorrhages type 1 (1% vs 3%) or type 2 (1% vs 2%) did not differ significantly (P = .25). Vasospasm occurred more often in patients who received IVT and MT vs MT alone (27% vs 14%, P = .006). In multivariate analysis, no statistically significant association was observed between IVT and MT vs MT alone for any of the outcomes. Conclusions and Relevance The results indicate that treatment of patients experiencing AIS due to a large vessel occlusion with IVT before MT does not appear to provide a clinical benefit over MT alone.

This situation can result in the use of incompatible combinations of SGAs and endotracheal tubes (ETTs). To address this mismatch possibility, we performed an in vitro study to establish an overview of possible combinations of SGAs and ETTs. METHODS We tested the passage of ETTs through SGAs in vitro and subsequent SGA removal with eight pediatric SGAs and six ETTs of different sizes in vitro. Results were compared with manufacturers' recommendations. Outcome parameters were the feasibility of passing the ETT through the SGA and then removing the SGA over the ETT. RESULTS The Air-Q® and the Air-Q®sp™ SGAs showed the best compatibility with ETTs across all sizes. Whenever intubation was possible, removal was possible for all SGAs with uncuffed ETTs. With many cuffed ETTs, however, SGA removal was impossible because the ETT cuff's pilot balloon was larger than the inner diameter of the SGA. Thus, although intubation was possible, removal of the SGA was not. The manufacturers' booklets do not warn of this limitation. CONCLUSIONS The use of combinations of SGA and ETTs with a size mismatch can lead to airway complications during intubation or to accidental extubation and tearing of the cuff pilot balloon line when removing the SGA. To avoid these problems, we devised a table that simplifies the choice of an appropriate SGA and ETT combination.","Kleine-Brueggeney, Maren; Kotarlic, Manuel; Theiler, Lorenz; Greif, Robert",Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12630-017-0992-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29058266/,597

The review resulted in identification of 1115 records, of which 80 full text articles were screened, with final inclusion of 16 studies. Included studies evaluated the effect of YMP on social-emotional functioning, and identified the potential for YMP to improve regulatory skills such as behavioral self-regulation and executive function. Among studies reviewed, 13 reported improvements in these domains, but quality appraisal indicated significant variability in risk of bias across studies, and heterogeneity of outcome measurements hindered comparison. Programs appeared to produce better results when implemented for at least 6 weeks and among children who had lower baseline social-emotional functioning.

A total of 18 patients who underwent endovascular management of PV via percutaneous transhepatic (n = 8) and transsplenic (n = 10) access were enrolled. Transsplenic access was chosen if the spleen was located in a normal position, the splenic vein (SpV) was preserved, and the target lesion did not involve confluence of the superior mesenteric and SpVs. Accessibility of the percutaneous transsplenic puncture was confirmed via ultrasound (US) in the angiography suite. All procedures were performed under local anesthesia. Percutaneous transhepatic or transsplenic access was performed using a 21-gauge Chiba needle under US and fluoroscopic guidance, followed by balloon angioplasty, stent placement, or variceal embolization. The access tract was embolized using coils and a mixture (1:2) of glue and ethiodized oil. Transhepatic or transsplenic access was successfully achieved in all patients. A total of 12 patients underwent stent placement; 3 had balloon angioplasty only; 2 had variceal embolization only; and 1 had variceal embolization followed by successful stent placement. Regarding major complications, 1 patient experienced a SpV tear with extravasation during transsplenic balloon angioplasty, which was successfully managed using temporary balloon inflation, followed by transfusion. Clinical success was achieved in 9 of 11 (82%) patients who exhibited clinical manifestations. The remaining 7 patients who underwent prophylactic endovascular management were healthy.

67254,Optimal Long-Acting Injectable Antipsychotic Management During COVID-19.,2021-01-12,"DHX9/RNA helicase A (RHA) is a host RNA helicase that participates in many critical steps of the HIV-1 life cycle. It co-assembles with the viral RNA genome into the capsid core. Virions deficient in RHA are less infectious as a result of reduced reverse transcription efficiency, demonstrating that the virion-associated RHA promotes reverse transcription before the virion gains access to the new host's RHA. Here, we quantified reverse transcription intermediates in HIV-1-infected T cells to clarify the mechanism by which RHA enhances HIV-1 reverse transcription efficiency. Consistently, purified recombinant human RHA promoted reverse transcription efficiency under in vitro conditions that mimic the early reverse transcription steps prior to capsid core uncoating. We did not observe RHA-mediated structural remodeling of the tRNALys3:viral RNA-annealed complex. RHA did not enhance the DNA synthesis rate until incorporation of the first few nucleotides, suggesting that RHA participates primarily in the elongation phase of reverse transcription. Pre-steady-state and steady-state kinetic studies revealed that RHA has little impact on the kinetics of single-nucleotide incorporation. Primer extension assays performed in the presence of trap dsDNA disclosed that RHA enhances the processivity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT). The biochemical assays used here effectively reflected and explained the low RT activity in HIV-1 virions produced from RHA-depleted cells. Moreover, RT activity in our assays indicated that RHA in HIV-1 virions is required for the efficient catalysis of (-)cDNA synthesis during viral infection before capsid uncoating. Our study identifies RHA as a processivity factor of HIV-1 RT.","Brady, Samantha; Singh, Gatikrushna; Bolinger, Cheryl; Song, Zhenwei; Boeras, Ioana; Weng, Kexin; Trent, Bria; Brown, William Clay; Singh, Kamalendra; Boris-Lawrie, Kathleen; Heng, Xiao",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.ra119.007679; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175158/,597

68057,Virtualised care and COVID-19.,2020-05-28,"OBJECTIVE If the narrative of ""coronavirus"" has an underlying theme, it may perhaps for some be one of survival, whilst for others, the theme might be suffering. The recurring motif of survival has continued throughout history, yet for the first time the sum of all fears has amounted to a run on the bare essentials. This paper seeks to offer an alternative formulation of ""panic buying,"" with references to literature, philosophy, and contemporary neurobiology. CONCLUSION The bare essentials disappeared perhaps as part of some self-fulfilling prophecy: the supermarkets became bare because others inadvertently lead us to believe they would become bare. The contagion model of emotional propagation provides a psychological model of how ""panic buying"" by an individual might lead to the replication of panic in an observer. The Polyvagal Theory further informs us of how the threat posed by the pandemic primes our limbic system to perceive danger, and explains how witnessing others engaging in fight-flight responses might evoke a fearful affect in an observer. In the end, it is perhaps through Nietzsche's study of classical tragedy that we may find some meaning to the pandemic, allowing our collective lived experience to serve as a template for growth.","Alchin, David",Australasian psychiatry : bulletin of Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists,https://doi.org/10.1177/1039856220936144; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32683892/,597

While the direct effects of the pandemic in regard to morbidity and mortality appear to be more significant in the developed world, the indirect harmful effects on already insufficient healthcare infrastructure on the African continent would in the long term be more detrimental to the populace. Women and children form a significant vulnerable population in underserved areas such as the sub-Saharan region, and expectedly will experience the disadvantages of limited healthcare coverage which is a major fall out of the pandemic. Paediatric cardiac services that are already sparse in various sub-Saharan countries are not left out of this downsizing. Restrictions on international travel for patients out of the continent to seek medical care and for international experts into the continent for regular mission programmes leave few options for children with cardiac defects to get the much-needed care.There is a need for a region-adapted guideline to scale-up services to cater for more children with congenital heart disease (CHD) while providing a safe environment for healthcare workers, patients, and their caregivers. This article outlines measures adapted to maintain paediatric cardiac care in a sub-Saharan tertiary centre in Nigeria during the COVID-19 pandemic and will serve as a guide for other institutions in the region who will inadvertently need to provide these services as the demand increases.","Sokunbi, Ogochukwu J; Mgbajah, Ogadinma; Olugbemi, Augustine; Udom, Bassey O; Idowu, Ariyo; Sanusi, Michael O",Cardiology in the young,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1047951120003650; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33140715/,597

Hospitalized patients negative for SARS-CoV-2 were used as controls.RESULTSWe found that the immune landscape in COVID-19 formed 3 dominant clusters, which correlated with disease severity. Longitudinal analysis identified a pattern of productive innate and adaptive immune responses in individuals who had a moderate disease course, whereas those with severe disease had features suggestive of a protracted and dysregulated immune response. Further, we identified coordinate immune alterations accompanying clinical improvement and decline that were also seen in patients who received IL-6 pathway blockade.CONCLUSIONThe hospitalized COVID-19 negative cohort allowed us to identify immune alterations that were shared between severe COVID-19 and other critically ill patients. Collectively, our findings indicate that selection of immune interventions should be based in part on disease presentation and early disease trajectory due to the profound differences in the immune response in those with mild to moderate disease and those with the most severe disease.FUNDINGBenaroya Family Foundation, the Leonard and Norma Klorfine Foundation, Glenn and Mary Lynn Mounger, and the National Institutes of Health.","Bolouri, Hamid; Speake, Cate; Skibinski, David; Long, S Alice; Hocking, Anne M; Campbell, Daniel J; Hamerman, Jessica A; Malhotra, Uma; Buckner, Jane H",The Journal of clinical investigation,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci143648; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33529167/,597

METHODS We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent PCI in England between January 2017 and April 2020 in the British Cardiovascular Intervention Society-National Institute of Cardiovascular Outcomes Research database. Analysis was restricted to 44 hospitals that reported contemporaneous activity on PCI. Only patients with primary PCI for STEMI were included in the analysis. RESULTS A total of 34 127 patients with STEMI (primary PCI 33 938, facilitated PCI 108, rescue PCI 81) were included in the study. There was a decline in the number of procedures by 43% (n=497) in April 2020 compared with the average monthly procedures between 2017 and 2019 (n=865). For all patients, the median time from symptom to hospital showed increased after the lockdown (150 (99-270) vs 135 (89-250) min, p=0.004) and a longer door-to-balloon time after the lockdown (48 (21-112) vs 37 (16-94) min, p<0.001). The in-hospital mortality rate was 4.8% before the lockdown and 3.5% after the lockdown (p=0.12). Following adjustment for baseline characteristics, no differences were observed for in-hospital death (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.68, p=0.67) and major adverse cardiovascular events (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.32, p=0.28). CONCLUSIONS Following the lockdown in England, we observed a decline in primary PCI procedures for STEMI and increases in overall symptom-to-hospital and door-to-balloon time for patients with STEMI.

Thorough screening of incoming patients, separation of diagnostic and treatment areas, regional management, hierarchical protection, disinfection protocols, and other measures were enforced to prevent virus transmission during endoscopic treatments. During the COVID-19 pandemic, between February and March 2020, 159 endoscopic examinations and treatments were performed, including emergency endoscopy for 17 patients. Among these, 7 patients were either previously infected with or were suspected carriers of the virus. Using the aforementioned control measures, we did not encounter a single case of cross-infection or infection among the patients or staff.

This allows cells to rapidly respond to environment changes. The highly conserved nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway was initially identified as a pathway that degrades aberrant mRNAs. NMD is now recognized as a pathway with additional functions including precisely regulating the expression of select natural mRNAs. Majority of these natural mRNAs encode fully functional proteins. Regulation of natural mRNAs by NMD is activated by NMD targeting features and environmental cues. Here, we show that Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains from three genetic backgrounds respond differentially to NMD depending on the environmental stimuli. We found that wild type and NMD mutant W303a, BY4741 and RM11-1a yeast strains respond similarly to copper in the environment but respond differentially to toxic cadmium. Furthermore, the PCA1 alleles encoding different mRNAs from W303a and RM11-1a strains are regulated similarly by NMD in response to the bio-metal copper but differentially in response to toxic cadmium.","Wong, Angelo; Lam, Ernest Moses; Pai, Cheryl; Gunderson, Annika; Carter, Tamar E; Kebaara, Bessie W",Yeast,https://doi.org/10.1002/yea.3565; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33955055/,597

States' difficulties to provide adequate and comprehensive response to people's health needs arising from the COVID-19 pandemic strengthened the impetus for UHC implementation. But while featured as the way to achieve justice in health, analyses of UHC-kind reform experiences since the 1990s show that it may be comprehended rather as a new facet of neoliberalism in the health policies' arena. Its insurance arrangements are aimed to finance packages of health goods and services for the poor, while states play mainly a role of public funds administrators, buying from public and private providers competing in the market. UHC contributes to health system fragmentation and segmentation, weakens public structures and opens new markets for corporations to capture public funds. COVID-19 pandemic subjected health systems to unforeseen stress, underscoring the crucial role that a well-funded public health system plays in people's lives. Assessing pandemic's challenges may be an opportunity to build more egalitarian health systems, based on dignity and not people's money.

73125,Reproductive Care During COVID-19.,2020-09-01,"This study is one of the first systematic attempts to examine the possibility of a common treatment facility (CTF) to treat infectious healthcare waste (HCW) in Nepal. First, the survey was conducted in 14 healthcare facilities (HFs) ranging from health posts to large hospitals selected from 120 total HFs in Nepalgunj sub-metropolitan city (SMC), a rapidly urbanising city of Nepal to investigate the current practices of HCW management (HCWM) and to estimate the waste generation and characteristics in the different HFs. The result shows that the average unit waste generation rate for health posts, clinics, urban health centres, and hospitals was estimated at 1.397 kg day-1, 1.608 kg day-1, 0.178 kg day-1 and 1.818 kg bed-1 day-1, respectively. Of the total 1242 kg day-1 HCW generated in Nepalgunj SMC, 73% is infected in the current situation, but if fully sorted at source, only 32% of the waste will be infected. Based on these HCW generation data and fraction of infectious waste, including waste management practices, three different scenarios are proposed for the capacity assessment and designing implementation modality of the CTF to treat infectious waste from all HFs of Nepalgunj SMC as a case study where an integrated solid waste management facility including material recovery facility and sanitary landfill site for municipal solid waste management is already in operation. The different implementation analyses are discussed, and the best implementation arrangement has been recommended for the sustainability of the project. This approach can be replicated in other cities alone or regions with many neighbouring cities of Nepal and explores a workable solution for HCWM in the rapidly urbanising cities of developing countries to help them improve their condition.","Pathak, Dhundi Raj; Nepal, Suvash; Thapa, Tejendra; Dhakal, Nimesh; Tiwari, Pravin; Sinha, Tirtha Kumar","Waste management & research : the journal of the International Solid Wastes and Public Cleansing Association, ISWA",https://doi.org/10.1177/0734242x211013910; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33928811/,597

Heartfulness meditation has been shown to improve burnout and sleep. In the current study, the effects of remote Heartfulness meditation in improving loneliness and sleep quality were measured.MethodsPhysicians and advance practice providers were randomly assigned to receive either daily Heartfulness Meditation program or no intervention (control group) in a prospective four-week randomized control study design. UCLA loneliness and PSQI scores were collected at baseline and after the program duration of 4 weeks. The study was retrospectively registered with trial Number, ISRCTN85787008 (Jan 8, 2021).ResultsOf the 155 subjects enrolled in the study, 50% were lonely and 97% had sleep problems. Attrition rate was 36%. Among those who completed the study, the mean UCLA loneliness scores decreased from 42.1 to 39.4 in the Heartfulness group (N=40, p=0.009) and 42.2 to 41.15 in the control group (N=57, p=0.254)).

By March, 2020, New York City had become the epicenter of the outbreak in the United States. METHODS We tracked all patients with confirmed coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) infection admitted to intensive care units (ICU) at Montefiore Medical Center (Bronx, NY). Data were obtained through manual review of electronic medical records. Patients had at least 30 days of follow-up. RESULTS Our first 300 ICU patients were admitted March 10 through April 11, 2020. The majority (60.7%) of patients were men. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was documented in 91.7% of patients; 91.3% required mechanical ventilation. Prone positioning was employed in 58% of patients and neuromuscular blockade in 47.8% of mechanically-ventilated patients. Neither intervention was associated with decreased mortality. Vasopressors were required in 77.7% of patients. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was present on admission in 40.7% of patients, and developed subsequently in 36.0%; 50.9% of patients with AKI received renal replacement therapy (RRT). Overall 30-day mortality rate was 52.3%, and 55.8% among patients receiving mechanical ventilation. In univariate analysis, higher mortality rate was associated with increasing age, male sex, hypertension, obesity, smoking, number of comorbidities, AKI on presentation, and need for vasopressor support. A representative multivariable model for 30-day mortality is also presented, containing patient age, gender, body mass index, and AKI at admission. As of May 11, 2020, 2 patients (0.7%) remained hospitalized. CONCLUSIONS Mortality in critical illness associated with COVID-19 is high. The majority of patients develop ARDS requiring mechanical ventilation, vasopressor-dependent shock, and AKI. The variation in mortality rates reported to date likely reflects differences in the severity of illness of the evaluated populations.","Chand, Sudham; Kapoor, Sumit; Orsi, Deborah; Fazzari, Melissa J; Tanner, Tristan G; Umeh, Genevieve C; Islam, Marjan; Dicpinigaitis, Peter V",Journal of intensive care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/0885066620946692; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32812834/,597

In the present study, red-clawed crayfish Cherax quadricarinatus was employed as a model organism. Animals were divided into four temperature groups (25, 20, 15 and 9 °C) and treated for 4 weeks, with the 25 °C group serving as a control. The total lipid content in the hepatopancreas as well as the triglyceride, cholesterol and free fatty acid levels in the hemolymph were determined. Lipids stored in the hepatopancreas and hemolymph decreased with decreasing temperature, with changes in the 9 °C group most pronounced, indicating that lipids are the main energy source for crayfish at low temperatures. Furthermore, enzyme activity of lipase, fatty acid synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and lipoprotein esterase, and gene expression analysis of fatty acid synthase gene, acetyl-CoA carboxylase gene and carnitine palmitoyltransferase gene showed that the digestion, synthesis and oxidation of lipids in the hepatopancreas were inhibited under low temperature stress, but expression of sphingolipid delta-4 desaturase (DEGS) was increased, indicating an increase in the demand for highly unsaturated fatty acids at low temperatures. Analysis of the expression of genes related to the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signalling pathway revealed that the adiponectin receptor gene was rapidly upregulated at low temperatures, which may in turn activate the expression of the downstream AMPKα gene, thereby inhibiting lipid anabolism.","Wu, Donglei; Liu, Zhiquan; Yu, Ping; Huang, Youhui; Cai, Mingqi; Zhang, Meng; Zhao, Yunlong",Journal of thermal biology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102693; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32888578/,597

PURPOSE The purpose of this article is to compare the efficacy and safety of first-line contact aspiration and stent-retriever thrombectomy in stroke patients with anterior circulation large-artery occlusion. METHODS We undertook a systematic review of studies of patients treated for large-artery occlusion, with the latest devices of either strategy, within six hours of stroke onset. We determined rates of final complete reperfusion (defined as modified Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction score = 3), periprocedural complications and 90-day functional independence (defined as modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 0-2), and excellent outcome (defined as mRS score 0-1) after contact aspiration and after stent-retriever thrombectomy using random-effects meta-analyses. Any differential effects in rates between the two strategies were assessed using random-effects meta-regressions. RESULTS Fifteen studies (1817 patients) were included. There was no difference in rates of final complete reperfusion at the end of all endovascular procedures between contact aspiration and stent retrievers (51.1%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 39.3-62.9; vs 38.3%, 95% CI 28.6-48.0; pint = 0.14), 90-day functional independence (45.0%, 40.7-49.2; vs 52.4%, 47.7-57.1; pint = 0.45) and excellent outcome (32.1%, 25.7-38.5; vs 34.1%, 21.2-46.9; pint = 0.94).

Indeed, greater worry about COVID-19 is associated with poorer mental health. However, older age is generally associated with better emotional well-being, despite increased likelihood of negative events (e.g. death of a spouse) with age. This study examined whether age moderated the relation between COVID-19 worries and mental health. METHODS A national sample of U.S. adults (N = 848; aged 18-85 years) completed an online survey from March 30 to April 5, 2020. The survey assessed anxiety, depression, general concern about COVID-19, perceived likelihood of contracting COVID-19, social distancing, self-quarantining, current mood, health, and demographics. RESULTS Older age was associated with better mental health (i.e. lower levels of anxiety and depression). Greater perceived likelihood of contracting COVID-19 was related to higher anxiety. However, this effect was moderated by age. At younger ages (18-49 years), the positive association between perceived likelihood of contracting COVID-19 and anxiety was significant, but the association was not significant at older ages (50+ years).

Most of the patients present to the hospital in advanced stage and have a poor prognosis. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity profile of oral metronomic chemotherapy (MCT) in the form of methotrexate and celecoxib in locally advanced, recurrent and metastatic head-and-neck cancers. Materials and Methods This was a single-arm retrospective observational study that included posttreatment patients with locally advanced, recurrent and metastatic disease in the year 2016 (January 1, to December 31, 2016). A total of 84 patients warranting palliative chemotherapy but not willing to take intravenous chemotherapy were included in the study. The oral MCT schedule consisted of oral celecoxib (200 mg twice daily) and oral methotrexate (15 mg/m2/week). Response evaluation was done using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria version 1.1, and toxicity profile was assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03. Descriptive statistics and Kaplan-Meier analysis were performed. Results Eighty-four patients, 68 males and 16 females, with a median age of 62 years (range: 35-80 years), were enrolled in the study to receive oral MCT. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status was 0-1 in 62 patients and 2-3 in 22 patients. The primary sites of disease were buccal mucosa (18), tongue (22), tonsil (24), lower alveolus (7), hypopharynx (10), and soft palate (3). The best clinical response rate in post oral MCT was seen in the first 4 months (120 days). Objective response was observed in 67% of patients in the form of stable disease (56%) and partial response (11%). Disease progression was observed in 27% of patients. The median follow-up was 192 (6.4 months) days. The median estimated overall survival was 195 (6.5 months) days. The median estimated progression-free survival was 110 (3.6 months) days. Symptomatic relief with respect to pain was reported in about 75% of patients. Eighteen (21%) patients had Grade I-II mucosal reactions. Grade III-IV mucosal reactions were observed in five (6%) patients. Seventy-eight (93%) patients died at the end of the study at 1 year. Dose reduction was required in 15 (18%) patients. Conclusion Oral MCT using celecoxib and methotrexate is an effective, economical, and well-tolerated regimen with good pain control and low toxicity profile in patients with locally advanced, recurrent and metastatic head-and-neck cancer.","Harsh, Kamlesh Kumar; Maharia, Sita Ram; Nirban, Raj Kumar; Khatri, Pramila; Beniwal, Surenderkumar; Kumar, Harvinder Singh; Jakhar, Shankar Lal",Journal of cancer research and therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.4103/jcrt.jcrt_702_18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32719267/,597

Methods All patients who received a telephone appointment in a 1-month period were invited to complete a questionnaire. An adaption of the Telehealth Satisfaction Scale (TeSS) was used. Patient responses were compared based on type of clinic, age and gender. Results 119 questionnaires were completed. The majority of responses to the adapted TeSS (Q1-7) were graded as 'Excellent', ranging from 79 (66%) to 112 (94%). 'Agree' responses ranged from 92 (77%) to 117 (98%) for questions (Q8-12), indicating high satisfaction. Patients consulted in post radical prostatectomy and PSA surveillance clinics gave a significantly greater number of 'Excellent' or 'Agree' responses. Older age was associated with a significantly greater number of 'Agree' responses to one item only. Responses were not affected by gender. Conclusion Our study demonstrates high overall satisfaction with the use of telephone consultations among urology patients. For some patients, telephone consultations are more suitable and may be utilised more frequently in the future. However, it is clear that in selected cases face-to-face consultations are required for safe, comprehensive clinical assessment.","Efthymiadis, Agathoklis; Hart, Edward Jm; Guy, Alexandra M; Harry, Rebecca; Mahesan, Tharani; Chedid, Wissam Abou; Uribe-Lewis, Santiago; Perry, Matthew Ja",Future healthcare journal,https://doi.org/10.7861/fhj.2020-0076; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33791468/,597
77593,The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and serotonin abnormalities: a selective overview for the implications of suicide prevention.,2010,"Urban water and waste management continues to be a major challenge, with the Earth's population projected to rise to 9 billion by 2050, with 70% of this population expected to live in cities. A combined treatment of wastewater and the organic fraction of municipal solid waste offers opportunities for improved environmental protection and energy recovery, but the collection and transport of organic wastes must be cost effective. This study compares three alternative kitchen waste collection and transportation systems for a virtual modern urban area with 300,000 residents and a population density of 10,000 persons per square kilometre. Door-to-door collection, being the standard practice in modern urban centres, remains the most economically advantageous at a cost of 263 euros per tonne of kitchen waste. Important drawbacks are the difficult logistics, increased city traffic, air and noise pollution. The quieter, cleaner and more hygienic vacuum transport of kitchen waste comes with a higher cost of 367 euros per tonne, mainly resulting from a higher initial investment cost for the system installation. The third option includes the well-known use of under-sink food waste disposers (often called garbage grinders) that are connected to the kitchen's wastewater piping system, with a total yearly cost of 392 euros per tonne. Important advantages with this system are the clean operation and the current availability of a city-wide sewage conveyance pipeline system. Further research is recommended, for instance the application of a life cycle assessment approach, to more fully compare the advantages and disadvantages of each option.","Schiettecatte, Wim; Tize, Ronald; De Wever, Heleen","Waste management & research : the journal of the International Solid Wastes and Public Cleansing Association, ISWA",https://doi.org/10.1177/0734242x14554646; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25341873/,597
78251,Obesity and covid-19: the unseen risks.,2020-07-16,"Clinical preventive services play an important role in preventing deaths, and Healthy People 2020 has set national goals for using clinical preventive services to improve population health (1). The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires many health plans to cover certain recommended clinical preventive services without cost-sharing when provided in-network (covered clinical preventive services).* To ascertain prevalence of the use of selected recommended clinical preventive services among persons aged ≥18 years, CDC analyzed data from the 2018 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a state-based annual nationwide survey conducted via landline and mobile phones in the United States, for 10 clinical preventive services covered in-network with no cost-sharing pursuant to the ACA. The weighted prevalence of colon, cervical, and breast cancer screening, pneumococcal and tetanus vaccination, and diabetes screening ranged from 66.0% to 79.2%; the prevalence of the other four clinical preventive services were <50%: 16.5% for human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination, 26.6% for zoster (shingles) vaccination, 33.2% for influenza vaccination, and 45.8% for HIV testing. Prevalence of HIV testing had the widest variation (3.1-fold differences) across states among the 10 services included in this report. The prevalence of use of clinical preventive services varied by insurance status, income level, and rurality, findings that are consistent with previous studies (2-6). The use of nine of the 10 services examined was lower among the uninsured, those with lower income, and those living in rural communities. Among those factors examined, insurance status was the dominant factor strongly associated with use of clinical preventive services, followed by income-level and rurality. Understanding factors influencing use of recommended clinical preventive services can potentially help decision makers better identify policies to increase their use including strategies to increase insurance coverage.","Song, Suhang; White, Allison; Kucik, James E",MMWR.

Is it possible a relation?,2020-06-27,"Introduction Coronavirus pneumonia not only severely affects the lung tissue but is also associated with systemic autoimmune inflammation, rapid overactivation of cytokines and chemokines known as ""cytokine storm"", and a high risk of thrombosis and thromboembolism. Since there is no specific therapy for this new coronavirus infection (COVID-19), searching for an effective and safe anti-inflammatory therapy is critical.Materials and methods This study evaluated efficacy and safety of pulse therapy with high doses of glucocorticosteroids (GCS), methylprednisolone 1,000 mg for 3 days plus dexamethasone 8 mg for another 3-5 days, in 17 patients with severe coronavirus pneumonia as a part of retrospective comparative analysis (17 patients in control group). The study primary endpoint was the aggregate dynamics of patients' condition as evaluated by an original CCS-COVID scale, which included, in addition to the clinical status, assessments of changes in the inflammation marker, C-reactive protein (CRP); the thrombus formation marker, D-dimer; and the extent of lung injury evaluated by computed tomography (CT). Patients had signs of lung injury (53.2 % and 25.6 %), increases in CRP 27 and 19 times, and a more than doubled level of D-dimer (to 1.41 µg/ml and 1.15 µg/ml) in the active therapy and the control groups, respectively. The GCS treatment group had a more severe condition at baseline.Results The GCS pulse therapy proved effective and significantly decreased the CCS-COVID scores. Median score difference was 5.00 compared to the control group (р=0.011). Shortness of breath considerably decreased; oxygen saturation increased, and the NEWS-2 clinical status scale scores decreased. In the GCS group, concentration of CRP significantly decreased from 134 mg/dl to 41.8 mg/dl (р=0.009) but at the same time, D-dimer level significantly increased from 1.41 µg/ml to 1.98 µg/ml (р=0.044). In the control group, the changes were nonsignificant. The dynamics of lung injury by CT was better in the treatment group but the difference did not reach a statistical significance (р=0.062). Following the GCS treatment, neutrophilia increased (р=0.0001) with persisting lymphopenia, and the neutrophil/lymphocyte (N/L) ratio, a marker of chronic inflammation, increased 2.5 times (р=0.006). The changes in the N/L ratio and D-dimer were found to correlate in the GCS pulse therapy group (r =0.49, p=0.04), which underlined the relationship of chronic autoimmune inflammation with thrombus formation in COVID-19. No significant changes were observed in the control group. In result, four patients developed venous thromboembolic complications (two of them had pulmonary artery thromboembolism) after the GCS pulse therapy despite the concomitant antiplatelet treatment at therapeutic doses. Recovery was slower in the hormone treatment group (median stay in the hospital was 26 days vs 18 days in the control group, р=0.001).Conclusion Pulse therapy with high doses of GCS exerted a rapid anti-inflammatory effect but at the same time, increased the N/L ratio and the D-dimer level, which increased the risk of thromboembolism.","Mareev, V Yu; Orlova, Ya A; Pavlikova, E P; Matskeplishvili, S T; Krasnova, T N; Malahov, P S; Samokhodskaya, L M; Mershina, E A; Sinitsyn, V E; Mareev, Yu V; Kalinkin, A L; Begrambekova, Yu L; Kamalov, A A",Kardiologiia,https://doi.org/10.18087/cardio.2020.6.n1226; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32720612/,597
78955,Effect of Lockdown in Surgical Emergency Accesses: Experience of a COVID-19 Hospital.,2020,"When preprocedural images are overlaid on intraprocedural images, interventional procedures benefit in that more structures are revealed in intraprocedural imaging. However, image artifacts, respiratory motion, and challenging scenarios could limit the accuracy of multimodality image registration necessary before image overlay. Ensuring the accuracy of registration during interventional procedures is therefore critically important. The goal of this study was to develop a novel framework that has the ability to assess the quality (i.e., accuracy) of nonrigid multimodality image registration accurately in near real time. We constructed a solution using registration quality metrics that can be computed rapidly and combined to form a single binary assessment of image registration quality as either successful or poor. Based on expert-generated quality metrics as ground truth, we used a supervised learning method to train and test this system on existing clinical data. Using the trained quality classifier, the proposed framework identified successful image registration cases with an accuracy of 81.5%. The current implementation produced the classification result in 5.5 s, fast enough for typical interventional radiology procedures. Using supervised learning, we have shown that the described framework could enable a clinician to obtain confirmation or caution of registration results during clinical procedures.","Lee, Eung-Joo; Plishker, William; Hata, Nobuhiko; Shyn, Paul B; Silverman, Stuart G; Bhattacharyya, Shuvra S; Shekhar, Raj",Journal of digital imaging,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10278-021-00523-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34647199/,597
79443,COVID-19 pandemic and medical publication.,2020-09-04,"BACKGROUND/AIMS Percutaneous liver biopsy (PCLB) or transjugular liver biopsy (TJLB) have traditionally been performed to obtain a sample of hepatic tissue; however, endoscopic ultrasound-guided liver biopsy (EUSLB) has become an attractive alternative. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of EUSLB, PCLB, and TJLB. METHODS Search strategies were developed in accordance with PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines. Major outcomes included the following: adequacy of biopsy specimens (i.e., complete portal triads [CPT], total specimen length [TSL] in mm, and length of longest piece [LLP]) in mm), and rate of adverse events. Only studies comparing all biopsy approaches (i.e., EUSLB, PCLB, and TJLB) were included. RESULTS Five studies (EUSLB [n=301]; PCLB [n=176]; and TJLB [n=179]) were included. Biopsy cumulative adequacy rates for EUSLB, PCLB, and TJLB were 93.51%, 98.27%, and 97.61%, respectively. Based on the subgroup analysis limited to EUS biopsy needles in current clinical practice, there was no difference in biopsy adequacy or adverse events for EUSLB compared to PCLB and TJLB (all p>0.050). A comparison of EUSLB and PCLB revealed no difference between specimens regarding both CPT (p=0.079) and LLP (p=0.085); however, a longer TSL (p<0.001) was observed. Compared to TJLB, EUSLB showed no difference in LLP (p=0.351), fewer CPT (p=0.042), and longer TSL (p=0.005). CONCLUSION EUSLB appears to be a safe, minimally invasive procedure that is comparable to PCLB and TJLB regarding biopsy specimens obtained and rate of adverse events associated with each method.","McCarty, Thomas R; Bazarbashi, Ahmad Najdat; Njei, Basile; Ryou, Marvin; Aslanian, Harry R; Muniraj, Thiruvengadam",Clinical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.5946/ce.2019.211; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33027584/,597

METHODS This prospective cohort study was conducted on 203 pregnant women between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation, undergoing gestational diabetes screening test with 50 g glucose challenge test (GCT). Fasting serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglyceride (TG) levels were measured during the week after GCT assessment. Information on the participants' pre-pregnancy weight, demographic/reproductive characteristics, and height and blood pressure (BP) measurements were documented at baseline entry into the study. Metabolic syndrome was defined as the co-existence of 3 or more of the following criteria: Body mass index (BMI) before pregnancy ≥ 30 kg/m2, BP ≥ 130/85 mmHg, GCT ≥ 140 mg/dl, TG ≥ 150 mg/dl, and HDL-C ≤ 50 mg/dl. All participants were followed through routine prenatal care, up to delivery. Any deliveries or rupture of membranes of less than 37 weeks of pregnancy were considered preterm delivery and PPROM, respectively. Statistical analysis was performed by SPSS V.20, and p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. FINDINGS MetS was detected in 10 (4.9%) of participants. Logistic regression analysis showed HDL-C levels, and hypertension were associated with spontaneous preterm delivery [(OR 0.952, 95% CI 0.910-0.995), (OR 1.629, 95% CI 1.554-1.709) respectively], but no statistically significant results were found for PPROM. CONCLUSIONS Low HDL-C levels and hypertension in mid-pregnancy are associated with the occurrence of spontaneous preterm deliveries, indicating that MetS and its components should be monitored more closely in pregnancy.","Niyaty, Shiva; Moghaddam-Banaem, Lida; Sourinejad, Hadis; Mokhlesi, Samira",Archives of gynecology and obstetrics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00404-020-05738-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803396/,597

However, BBs, unlike double-lumen tubes, must be placed in the bronchus of the lung being operated on, hence can be damaged by surgical manipulation. Intubation was unexpectedly difficult in this male patient, so a Coopdech BB was placed in the right mainstem bronchus through a single-lumen tracheoscopic ventilation tube for a thoracoscopic right upper lobectomy. During the bronchial resection, however, the distal tip of the BB was transected and pinched in the staple line, so the staple line was partially opened, and the BB was withdrawn into the trachea. The opened bronchial stump was sutured manually under apnea without conversion to an open thoracotomy, and there was no significant air leakage through the suture line.

A novel example of such advancement can be found in laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) surgery. Performing surgery through a single site of access holds the promise of decreased morbidity, lower blood loss, shorter convalescence, and improved cosmesis. Given the nonextirpative nature of the pyeloplasty procedure, this patient cohort has proven to be the ideal candidates for LESS surgery. The driving force behind adaptation of this newer technique can be attributed to innovations in access sites and devices, instrumentation, optics, and robotic-based assistance. There are now several studies in the published literature demonstrating the feasibility and efficacy of LESS pyeloplasty in both children and adults. Although comparative studies have failed to demonstrate any objective advantage of the LESS pyeloplasty operation, it is important to realize that LESS surgery is still a fairly new technique. Further technological developments and additional studies will ultimately define its role in the field of urologic surgery, and subsequently, its application for the pyeloplasty procedure.","Clements, Thomas; Raman, Jay D",Therapeutic advances in urology,https://doi.org/10.1177/1756287211411357; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21904570/,597

In our recently published work and this study, by clarifying the vertical transmission mechanism of Rice stripe virus (RSV) in Laodelphax striatellus, we provide a novel paradigm for how arboviruses enter insect germ-line cells. Instead of direct interaction with a viral receptor, the virus binds to a secreted ligand protein, hitchhiking the ligand-receptor pathway to achieve cell entry. Vitellogenin (Vg) is an indispensable protein for embryo development that is synthesized extra-ovarially and taken up by germ-line cells through Vg receptor (VgR)-mediated endocytosis. After revealing that RSV invades L. striatellus ovary by a specific molecular interaction with the insect Vg in haemolymph, this study addressed VgR's function in mediating the RSV invasion of the germarium nurse cells, further confirming the ligand's receptor-mediated viral cell-invasion mechanism.

SAPD treatment may improve plasma clearance by the maintenance of a high plasma-to-dialysate concentration gradient and by increasing the mass transfer area coefficient (MTAC) of solutes. The system is designed for daily 8-hr treatment (12 kg, nighttime system). A wearable system (2.3 kg, daytime system) may further enhance the clearance of phosphate and organic waste solutes during the day.

Plasma clearance (Cl), MTAC, and total mass transport (MT) of urea, creatinine, phosphate, and potassium were compared with a static dwell (n = 28). Cl, MTAC, and MT of urea, creatinine, phosphate, and potassium were low in the pig as compared to humans due to the pig's low peritoneal transport status and could be enhanced only to a limited extent by SAPD treatment compared with a static dwell (nighttime system: Cl urea: ×1.5 (p = .029), Cl creatinine: ×1.7 (p = .054), Cl phosphate: ×1.5 (p = .158), Cl potassium: ×1.6 (p = .011); daytime system: Cl creatinine: ×2.7 (p = .040), Cl phosphate: ×2.2 (p = .039)).

82562,Narrative identity in borderline personality disorder.,2021-01-07,"In the past two decades, supercritical fluid chromatography has evolved from a niche application to a comprehensive technology and a fully-fledged alternative to conventional high-performance liquid chromatography. In this study, we have focused on chiral separation of synthetic cathinones in gradient supercritical fluid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry using an inverse gradient of a make-up solvent. Synthetic cathinones possess an amphetamine-like effect and, therefore, are frequently being offered on the Internet as a replacement for illicit drugs. Cathinones are chiral compounds, however, they are usually marketed and used as racemic mixtures. Since the effect of individual enantiomers can significantly vary, there is a need for the development of enantioseparation methods enabling to study the biological effects of individual enantiomers. Since cathinones are basic molecules, they are easily protonated (positively charged) under weakly acidic mobile phase conditions, which is a typical feature of supercritical mobile phases with an alcohol as an organic modifier. The positively charged species represent ideal analytes for ion exchangers, such as chiral zwitterion ion exchangers Chiralpak ZWIX (+) and Chiralpak ZWIX (-), which possess a positively and negatively charged unit in the molecular structure of the selectors. The presence of the positive charge in the selector's structure, functioning as a counter-ion for the positively charged analytes, significantly reduces the required amount of a buffer, which is plausible for hyphenation of such a separation system with mass spectrometry. For mass spectrometry hyphenated to supercritical fluid chromatography, the use of a make-up solvent is required to avoid analyte precipitation when using a low concentration of an organic co-solvent (modifier) in the super-/subcritical mobile phase. Hereby, we introduce a unique approach, which is based on the gradient introduction of the make-up to the post-column effluent. Using this approach, it is possible to keep constant the overall amount of the organic solvent (modifier and make-up) introduced into the mass spectrometer when using a gradient of the organic modifier. We show that the developed gradient elution method facilitates the chiral separation of all employed analytes, while the mobile-phase gradient compensation by the inverse make-up gradient enables their detection with high signal intensities.","Kolderová, Natalie; Jurásek, Bronislav; Kuchař, Martin; Lindner, Wolfgang; Kohout, Michal",Journal of chromatography.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Thirteen MOCA procedures were performed in 11 patients (age range, 4-16 years) with KTS and symptomatic persistent embryonic or dysplastic veins during a 24-month period. All patients were evaluated with color Doppler (CD) ultrasound (US), contrast-enhanced MR imaging, and venography to assess the anatomy of the target vessels and patency of the deep venous system. All procedures were performed under general anesthesia with a ClariVein catheter and liquid sodium tetradecyl sulfate as the sclerosing agent. US and fluoroscopic guidance were used in all cases. Technical success rate, primary occlusion rate, adverse effects, and recanalization rates were evaluated. Clinical and radiological (CD US) controls were performed 1 day, 7 days, 1 month, and 6 months after the procedure and once a year thereafter, with a mean follow-up of 16 months (range, 6-25 months). RESULTS Technical success and primary occlusion were achieved in all patients with no adverse events. During the follow-up period, CD US demonstrated partial recanalization and symptom recurrence in 2 patients (18%), 14 and 18 months after the initial procedure. These 2 patients had a second ablation procedure with no recanalization or symptom recurrence during the subsequent follow-up period.

The second premolar was the pontic of the prosthesis. The three-element fixed prosthesis with a zirconia infrastructure and Y-TZP coating were cemented, in addition to using a flat occlusal splint made of acrylic resin in the region. Combined axial and oblique loads of 100N and 300N were applied. RESULTS The tensile stresses on MT implant bone tissue produced values of 4-19% lower than those of HE implants. The lowest differences were observed for oblique loading with an occlusal splint, with a 4% (Ti-Y-TZP) and 9% (Ti-Ti) decrease. When the compressive stresses were evaluated, HE implants produced lower values than MT implants. CONCLUSION A significant increase was observed in the oblique loading stresses in the absence of occlusal splints, regardless of the applied load.","Henrique, M N; Caldas, R A; Baroudi, K; Amaral, M; Vitti, R P; Silva-Concílio, L R",The European journal of prosthodontics and restorative dentistry,https://doi.org/10.1922/ejprd_02080baroudi09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33079499/,597

The cortical-evoked potential gap-induced inhibition has also been investigated in animals as well as in human subjects. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of age on the cortical N1-P2 complex in the gap-prepulse inhibition paradigm. Fifty-seven subjects, aged 20 to 68 years, without continuous tinnitus, were tested with two effective gap conditions (embedded gap of 50- or 20-ms duration). Retest sessions were performed within one month. A significant gap-induced inhibition of the N1-P2 complex was found in both gap durations. Age differently affected the inhibition, depending on gap duration. With a 50-ms gap, the inhibition decreased significantly with the increase in age. This age-inhibition relationship was not found when using a 20-ms gap. The results were reproducible in the retest session. Our findings suggest that the interaction between age and gap duration should be considered when applying the gap-induced inhibition of the cortical-evoked potential as an objective measure of tinnitus in human subjects. Further studies with tinnitus patients are warranted to identify gap duration that would minimize the effects of age and maximize the difference in the inhibition between those with and without tinnitus.","Ku, Yunseo; Kim, Do Youn; Kwon, Chiheon; Noh, Tae Soo; Park, Moo Kyun; Lee, Jun Ho; Oh, Seung Ha; Kim, Hee Chan; Suh, Myung-Whan",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0241136; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33152745/,597
84368,"Years of Potential Life Lost Secondary to COVID-19: Cook County, Illinois.",2021-03-23,"BACKGROUND Pharmacological treatments for critical processes in patients need to be initiated as rapidly as possible; for this reason, it is a standard of care to prepare the main anesthesia and emergency drugs in advance. As a result, 20%-50% of the prepared drugs remain unused and are then discarded. Decreasing waste by optimizing drug use is an attractive strategy for meeting both cost containment and environmental sustainability. The primary end point of this study was to measure the actual amount of drug wastage in the operating rooms (ORs) and intensive care units (ICUs) of a Regional Health Service (RHS). The secondary end point was to analyze and estimate the economic implications of this waste for the Health Service and to suggest possible measures to reduce it. METHODS This prospective observational multicenter study was conducted across 12 hospitals, all of which belong to the same RHS in the north-east of Italy. Data collection took place in March 2018 and included patients admitted to ICUs, emergency areas, and ORs of the participating hospitals. Data concerning drug preparation and administration were collected for all consecutive patients, independent of case types and of whether operations were scheduled or unscheduled. Drug wastage was defined as follows: drugs prepared in ready-to-use syringes but not administered at all and discarded untouched. We then estimated the costs of wasted drugs for a 1-year period using the data from this study and the yearly regional pharmacy orders of drugs provided to the ORs and ICUs. We also performed a sensitivity analysis to validate the robustness of our assumptions and qualitative conclusions. RESULTS We collected data for a total of 13,078 prepared drug syringes. Drug wastage varied from 7.8% (Urapidil, an alpha-1 antagonist antihypertensive) to 85.7% (epinephrine) of prepared syringes, with an overall mean wastage rate of 38%. The estimated yearly waste was 139,531 syringes, for a total estimated financial cost of €78,060 ($92,569), and an additional quantity of medical waste amounting to 4968 kg per year. The total provider time dedicated to the preparation of unused drugs was predicted to be 1512 working hours per year. CONCLUSIONS The overall extent of drug wastage in ORs and ICUs is concerning. Interventions aimed at minimizing waste-related costs and improving the environmental sustainability of our practice are paramount. Effort should be put into designing a more efficient workflow that reduces this waste while providing for the emergency availability of these medications in the OR and ICU.","Barbariol, Federico; Deana, Cristian; Lucchese, Francesca; Cataldi, Giuseppe; Bassi, Flavio; Bove, Tiziana; Vetrugno, Luigi; De Monte, Amato",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0000000000005457; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33667211/,597

Numerous elements of the RSoXS station were designed for optimal performance for measurements on soft matter systems, where it is of critical importance to minimize beam damage and maximize collection efficiency of polarized X-rays. These elements include a novel optical design, sample manipulator and sample environments, as well as detector setups. Finally, we will report the performance of the measurement station, including energy resolution, higher harmonic content and suppression methods, the extent and mitigation of the carbon absorption dip on optics, and the range of polarizations available from the elliptically polarized undulator source.","Gann, Eliot; Crofts, Thomas; Holland, Glenn; Beaucage, Peter; McAfee, Terry; Kline, Joseph R; Collins, Brian A; McNeill, Chris; Fischer, Daniel A; DeLongchamp, Dean",Journal of physics.

85560,Moral judgment is important in COVID-19 pandemic.,2021-05-31,"Programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF) is a gene-expression mechanism used to express many viral and some cellular genes. In contrast, efficient natural utilization of -2 PRF has not been demonstrated previously in eukaryotic systems. Like all nidoviruses, members of the Arteriviridae (a family of positive-stranded RNA viruses) express their replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab from two long ORFs (1a and 1b), where synthesis of pp1ab depends on -1 PRF. These polyproteins are posttranslationally cleaved into at least 13 functional nonstructural proteins. Here we report that porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), and apparently most other arteriviruses, use an additional PRF mechanism to access a conserved alternative ORF that overlaps the nsp2-encoding region of ORF1a in the +1 frame. We show here that this ORF is translated via -2 PRF at a conserved G_GUU_UUU sequence (underscores separate ORF1a codons) at an estimated efficiency of around 20%, yielding a transframe fusion (nsp2TF) with the N-terminal two thirds of nsp2. Expression of nsp2TF in PRRSV-infected cells was verified using specific Abs, and the site and direction of frameshifting were determined via mass spectrometric analysis of nsp2TF. Further, mutagenesis showed that the frameshift site and an unusual frameshift-stimulatory element (a conserved CCCANCUCC motif 11 nucleotides downstream) are required to direct efficient -2 PRF. Mutations preventing nsp2TF expression impair PRRSV replication and produce a small-plaque phenotype. Our findings demonstrate that -2 PRF is a functional gene-expression mechanism in eukaryotes and add another layer to the complexity of arterivirus genome expression.","Fang, Ying; Treffers, Emmely E; Li, Yanhua; Tas, Ali; Sun, Zhi; van der Meer, Yvonne; de Ru, Arnoud H; van Veelen, Peter A; Atkins, John F; Snijder, Eric J; Firth, Andrew E",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1211145109; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23043113/,597

The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of a comprehensive laparoscopic intestinal workshop for the adoption of laparoscopic colonic surgery. METHODS A 2-day comprehensive laparoscopic intestinal surgery workshop included didactic teaching and supervised hands-on practice of numerous laparoscopic colon resections on a cadaveric model. Participants completed pre-, post- and 6-month postcourse questionnaires. RESULTS The participants (n = 39) had been in practice for a mean of 10 (interquartile range 3-18) years. Fifty-one percent (n = 20) were already performing laparoscopic colectomies as part of their practices prior to the course. Regardless of whether they were performing laparoscopic colectomies prior to the course or not, attending the 2-day workshop improved their self-assessed preparedness to perform laparoscopic colectomies. Six months after the intestinal workshop, 10 of 16 respondents who were not performing laparoscopic colectomies prior to the course had performed at least 1 since the course. Seven of these individuals had a preceptor for their first case. Reasons cited for not performing a laparoscopic colectomy since the workshop included perceived inadequate surgical skill set, a lack of preceptor and the lack of an appropriate patient. CONCLUSION A comprehensive laparoscopic intestinal workshop contributed to the perceived acquisition of advanced laparoscopic surgical skills. Local laparoscopic preceptorship was an important adjunct to the workshop for the incorporation of laparoscopic colorectal surgery into practice.","Asano, Tracey K; Soto, Claudia; Poulin, Eric C; Mamazza, Joseph; Boushey, Robin P",Canadian journal of surgery.

85972,COVID-19 and Iran: swimming with hands tied!,2020-04-06,"AIMS Pregnancy is associated with numerous changes in physiological and metabolic processes to ensure successful progression to full term. One such change is the alteration of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism and formation of eicosanoids. This study explores the changes in AA metabolites formed through the cytochrome P450 mediated pathway to epoxyeicosatrienoic (EET), dihydroxyeicosatrienoic (DHET), and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic (HETE) acids which have been implicated in blood pressure regulation and inflammatory responses that are important for a healthy pregnancy. MAIN METHODS The study determines circulating levels of EETs, DHETs and HETEs extracted from erythrocyte membranes and measured by mass spectroscopy during the progression of a normal pregnancy. Blood samples, from 25 women, were collected at three time points including 25-28 weeks gestation, 28-32 weeks gestation, and the non-pregnant control at 3-4 months postpartum. KEY FINDINGS Results demonstrate that healthy pregnancy is associated with significant increases in 8,9-DHET, 11,12-DHET and 14,15-DHET and a decrease in trans 8,9-EET during 28-32 weeks gestation compared to 3-4 months postpartum. These differences are likely due to several mechanisms including an increase in soluble epoxide hydrolase activity, a decrease in glutathione conjugation, and altered cytochrome P450 enzyme expression and/or activity that occurs during pregnancy. SIGNIFICANCE Metabolism of AA through the cytochrome P450 pathway generates physiologically important eicosanoids that could play an important role in the progression of a healthy pregnancy. Establishing the changes that occur during normal pregnancy may, in the future, help in early detection of pregnancy complications including pre-eclampsia.","Somani, Selina T; Zeigler, Maxwell; Fay, Emily E; Leahy, Maggie; Bermudez, Bethanee; Totah, Rheem A; Hebert, Mary F",Life sciences,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2020.118590; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069736/,597

86775,Commentary on 2 Cases of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms Occurring in Association With COVID-19.,2021-03-05,"BACKGROUND Given the global shortage of N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFP2 in Europe) during the COVID-19 pandemic, KN95 masks (Chinese equivalent of the N95 and FFP2) were imported and distributed in South Africa (SA). However, there are hardly any published independent safety data on KN95 masks. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the seal, fit and filtration efficiency of several brands of KN95 masks marketed for widespread use in SA healthcare facilities, using standardised testing protocols. METHODS The verifiability of manufacturer and technical details was first ascertained, followed by evaluation of the number of layers comprising the mask material. The testing protocol involved a directly observed positive and negative pressure user seal check, which if passed was followed by qualitative fit testing (sodium saccharin) in healthy laboratory or healthcare workers. Quantitative fit testing (3M) was used to validate the qualitative fit testing method. The filtration efficacy and integrity of the mask filter material were evaluated using a particle counter-based testing rig utilising aerosolised saline (expressed as filtration efficacy of 0.3 µm particles). Halyard FLUIDSHIELD 3 N95 and 3M 1860 N95 masks were used as controls. RESULTS Twelve KN95 mask brands (total of 36 masks) were evaluated in 7 participants. The mask type and manufacturing details were printed on only 2/12 brands (17%) as per National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health and European Union regulatory requirements. There was considerable variability in the number of KN95 mask layers (between 3 and 6 layers in the 12 brands evaluated). The seal check pass rate was significantly lower in KN95 compared with N95 masks (1/36 (3%) v. 12/12 (100%); p<0.0001). Modification of the KN95 ear-loop tension using head straps or staples, or improving the facial seal using Micropore 3M tape, enhanced seal test performance in 15/36 KN95 masks evaluated (42%). However, none of these 15 passed downstream qualitative fit testing compared with the control N95 masks (0/15 v. 12/12; p<0.0001). Only 4/8 (50%) of the KN95 brands tested passed the minimum filtration requirements for an N95 mask (suboptimal KN95 filtration efficacy varied from 12% to 78%, compared with 56% for a surgical mask and >99% for the N95 masks at the 0.3 µm particle size). CONCLUSIONS The KN95 masks tested failed the stipulated safety thresholds associated with protection of healthcare workers against airborne pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2. These preliminary data have implications for the regulation of masks and their distribution to healthcare workers and facilities in SA.","Mottay, L; Le Roux, J; Perumal, R; Esmail, A; Timm, L; Sivarasu, S; Dheda, K",South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,https://doi.org/10.7196/samj.2021.v111i3.15381; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33334390/,597

Palliative radiotherapy may improve or stabilize health-related quality of life and symptoms, best measured by patient-reported outcomes. There is no systematic analysis if palliative radiotherapy for head and neck cancer improves or stabilizes health-related quality of life or symptoms as validly measured by patient-reported outcomes. Therefore, the primary objective of this systematic review (PROSPERO-ID: CRD42020166434) was to assess the effect of palliative radiotherapy for head and neck cancer on patient-reported outcomes. The secondary objective was to assess the rate and quality of use of patient-reported outcomes in relevant studies claiming a ""palliative effect"" of radiotherapy. The databases MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, ""ClinicalTrials.gov"" were searched. Concerning the primary objective, four studies were eligible to assess the effectiveness of palliative radiotherapy as measured by patient-reported outcomes. A narrative synthesis suggests a favorable impact of palliative radiotherapy on health-related quality of life and symptom burden. The risk of bias, however, is considerable and the overall quality of evidence low. Concerning the secondary objective, over 90% of studies claiming a ""palliative effect"" of palliative radiotherapy did either not use patient-reported outcomes or did so by limited quality. In conclusion, implementation of patient-reported outcomes in studies assessing palliative radiotherapy for head and neck cancer should be fostered. Palliative radiotherapy remains an option for head and neck cancer patients, although more studies focusing on patient-reported outcomes are needed.

A study on pharmacy purchases of psychiatric drugs from wholesalers in the days prior to the first and second COVID-19 lockdowns in Germany.,2021-06-02,"Amid concerns of inadequate medical supplies and staffing anticipated from a surge in COVID-19 cases, many health care systems across the United States (U.S.) began shutting down non-essential patient services in March 2020. These sudden shifts bring up questions about the long-term effects of COVID-19 on already fragile rural health care systems and the ability of rural populations, including farmers and farm workers, to meet their health care needs. To provide alternative and safe access to health care, the Federal government relaxed telehealth regulations, which effectively removed some of the largest regulatory barriers that had limited the adoption of telehealth in the U.S. In this commentary, we draw on the example of the Marshfield Clinic Health System (MCHS), a large rural health care system in Wisconsin and provide an early assessment of how it adjusted its telehealth services during the early months of COVID-19. While the long-term effects of the pandemic on rural health care systems will not be known for some time, the example of MCHS points to the importance of on-going and sustained investments to support the resilience of health care systems and their ability to weather crises. With early evidence that MCHS patients and practitioners are interested in continuing to use telehealth post-COVID-19, we conclude our commentary by offering three recommendations to remove hurdles and improve quality of telehealth care.","Meyer, Chris; Becot, Florence; Burke, Rick; Weichelt, Bryan",Journal of agromedicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/1059924x.2020.1814921; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32921284/,597

Our objective was to assess the validity of the HbA1c diagnostic cutpoint of 6.5% based upon published evidence of the prevalence of retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy as markers of diabetes. METHODS Data Sources PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Scopus and CINAHL from 1990-March 2019, grey literature sources. Study Selection All studies reported after 1990 (to ensure standardized HbA1c values) where HbA1c levels were presented in relation to prevalence of retinopathy, nephropathy or neuropathy in subjects not known to have diabetes. Data Extraction Studies were screened independently, data abstracted, and risk of bias appraised. Data Synthesis Data were synthesized using HbA1c categories of < 6.0% (< 42 mmol/mol), 6.0-6.4% (42-47 mmol/mol) and ≥ 6.5% (≥ 48 mmol/mol). Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted for retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy prevalence stratified by HbA1c categories. Random-effects multivariable meta-regression was conducted to identify predictors of retinopathy prevalence and sources of between-study heterogeneity. RESULTS Pooled mean prevalence was: 4.0%(95% CI: 3.2-5.0%) for retinopathy, 10.5% (95% CI: 4.0-19.5%) for nephropathy, 2.5% (95% CI: 1.1-4.3%) for neuropathy. Mean prevalence when stratified for HbA1c < 6.0%, 6.0-6.4% and ≥ 6.5% was: retinopathy: 3.4% (95% CI: 1.8-5.4%), 2.3% (95% CI: 1.6-3.2%) and 7.8%(95% CI: 5.7-10.3%); nephropathy: 7.1% (95% CI: 1.7-15.9%), 9.6% (95% CI: 0.8-26.4%) and 17.1% (95% CI: 1.0-46.9%); neuropathy: 2.1% (95% CI: 0.0-6.8%), 3.4% (95% CI: 0.0-11.6%) and 2.8% (95% CI: 0.0-12.8%). Multivariable meta-regression showed HbA1c ≥ 6.5% (OR: 4.05; 95% CI: 1.92-8.57%), age > 55 (OR: 3.23; 95% CI 1.81-5.77), and African-American race (OR: 10.73; 95% CI: 4.34-26.55), to be associated with higher retinopathy prevalence. Marked heterogeneity in prevalence estimates was found across all meta-analyses (Cochran's Q-statistic p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of nephropathy and moderate retinopathy was increased in subjects with HbA1c values ≥ 6.5% confirming the high specificity of this value for diagnosing T2DM; however, at HbA1c < 6.5% retinopathy increased at age > 55 years and, most strikingly, in African-Americans, suggesting there may be excess microvascular complication prevalence (particularly nephropathy) in individuals below the diabetes diagnostic threshold.","Butler, Alexandra E; English, Emma; Kilpatrick, Eric S; Östlundh, Linda; Chemaitelly, Hiam S; Abu-Raddad, Laith J; Alberti, K George M M; Atkin, Stephen L; John, W Garry",Acta diabetologica,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00592-020-01606-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33141338/,597

We developed an objective model aiming to standardize this assessment, proposing a methodology that could be adopted in future studies designed to evaluate outcomes in the treatment of hypospadias. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the inter and intra observer reliability of a method to assess the quality of the urethral plate (UP) in hypospadias (POST - Plate Objective Scoring Tool) based on elements of glans characteristics. The reliability of such scoring methodology was compared to an analog accepted tool: the Glans-Urethral Meatus-Shaft (GMS) score. A secondary goal was to compare some characteristics of the UP in GMS score to POST values; aiming to find the threshold between favorable and unfavorable plates. METHODS Data were prospectively obtained from prepubertal boys who underwent primary hypospadias repair between January 2018 and November 2019. Intrinsic elements of the glanular UP (A: distal midline mucocutaneous junction; B: Glanular knob where the mucosal edges of the UP's edge change direction; C: Glanular/coronal junction) were marked and the AB/BC ratio calculated. The ""G"" and ""M"" components of the GMS score were measured electronically three times by four different reviewers with variable pediatric urology experience and blinded to each other values. Favorable UP, according to the GMS score was compared to measurements obtained by POST (AB/BC ratio). RESULTS 84 subjects were enrolled. The POST score had an excellent inter-observer agreement for the evaluation of the UP in distal hypospadias (Kappa = 0.832) while the ""G"" parameter of the GMS correlated poorly among the observers. The Inter-Class Correlation (ICC) analysis to examine the intra-rater agreement value was 0.914 (95% CI 0.87, 0.95.). AB/BC ratio values ranged from 0.6 to 1.6, with a mean of 1.12. The POST cut-off value for ""favorable"" UP was 1.2 (AUC = 0.62) 95% CI (0.52-0.84) (sensitivity 80% and specificity 60%). CONCLUSIONS The POST score has higher inter-observer reliability and functions favorably when compared to the GMS. In addition, it demonstrated a high intra-observer reliability among observers of variable experience. Our findings suggest that the POST score adds to evaluation of the UP and could be incorporated as an additional criterion to assess outcomes in distal hypospadias repairs.","Abbas, Tariq O; Vallasciani, Santiago; Elawad, Abubakr; Elifranji, Mohammed; Leslie, Bruno; Elkadhi, Abderrahman; Pippi Salle, J L",Journal of pediatric urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpurol.2020.07.043; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830060/,597

This review summarizes the findings that have emerged from older populations as well as from populations suffering from pathological aging, namely Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease. Although older adults are an interesting population to study in terms of chronic stress, other stress-related diseases can occur throughout the lifespan. The second section covers some of these stress-related diseases that have recently received a great deal of attention, namely burnout, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Given that chronic stress contributes to the development of certain pathologies by accelerating and/or exacerbating pre-existing vulnerabilities that vary from one individual to the other, the final section summarizes data obtained on potential variables contributing to the association between chronic stress and cognition.","Marin, Marie-France; Lord, Catherine; Andrews, Julie; Juster, Robert-Paul; Sindi, Shireen; Arsenault-Lapierre, Geneviève; Fiocco, Alexandra J; Lupien, Sonia J",Neurobiology of learning and memory,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nlm.2011.02.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21376129/,597

METHODS Coagulated blood samples for serology and oropharyngeal swabs for virology were collected from healthy dogs (n=47) and from dogs with acute respiratory disease (n=49). For diseased dogs a convalescent blood sample was also collected 3-4 weeks later. Oropharyngeal swabs were subjected to virus isolation and tested for canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV), canine adenovirus (CAdV) 2, canine herpesvirus (CHV), canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV), canine influenza virus (CIV), canine distemper virus (CDV), Bordetella bronchiseptica, Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus, and Mycoplasma cynos nucleic acids by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Sera were tested for CRCoV antibody using competitive ELISA and results expressed as percent of inhibition (POI). RESULTS The mean age of diseased dogs (2.7, min <0.5, max 8.5 years) was lower than the mean age of healthy dogs (5.3, min <0.5, max 17 years) (p<0.001). In total, 20/94 (21%) dogs were positive for at least one agent by qPCR. Diseased dogs were most commonly positive for M. cynos (8/47, 17%), followed by CPIV (3/47, 6%) and B. bronchiseptica (3/47, 6%), while healthy dogs were most commonly positive for CAdV-2 (6/47, 13%), followed by M. cynos (2/47, 4%). All samples were negative for CIV, CRCoV, CDV and S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus. Viruses were not isolated from any of the samples tested. In total, 47/93 (50%) dogs were seropositive for CRCoV on at least one sampling occasion. Samples from diseased dogs were more frequently seropositive for CRCoV, with higher POI, than samples from healthy dogs. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE We showed that CAdV-2, CPIV, CHV, CRCoV, B. bronchiseptica and M. cynos circulated among sampled dogs. The convenience sampling methodology, with a poor match between the populations of diseased and healthy dogs in terms of age, breed and use, together with the relatively small sample size precluded inference of any causal relationships between infection with a given pathogen and development of disease.

89035,A significant reduction in the diagnosis of melanoma during the Covid-19 lockdown in a third level center in the north of Italy.,2020-07-26,"BACKGROUND Increased use of telemedicine in the healthcare system is a political goal in Denmark. Although the number of hospital patients using interventions such as the video consultation has increased in recent years only a small proportion of the outpatient and inpatient visits involve telemedicine. The TELEMED database (https://telemedicine.cimt.dk/) has been launched at the Center for Innovative Medical Technologies in Denmark to ensure that hospital managers and healthcare professionals have access to information about telemedicine services and their effectiveness. This article describes the development and the content of the TELEMED database. METHODS A structured literature search was made in the PubMed Database for randomised controlled trials or observational studies with a control group that investigated the effect of telemedicine interventions for hospital patients. Data were extracted from each article on the clinical effectiveness, patient perceptions, economic effects and implementation challenges. As the database should only provide inspiration to healthcare professionals regarding possibilities for use of telemedicine, the risk of bias in the studies was not assessed. RESULTS The literature search resulted in 2825 hits. Based on full text assessment, 331 articles were included for data extraction and assessment. These articles present telemedicine services used in 22 different medical specialities. Forty-eight percent of the studies found a positive, statistically significant clinical effect, while 47% showed no statistically significant difference. In 48% of the studies, patients' experiences were examined and of these 68% found positive patient experiences. Fifty-four percent of the articles included information on the economic effects and, of these, 51% found reduction in healthcare utilization. In the majority of studies between two and four types of implementation challenges were found.Conclusions and recommendations: The TELEMED database provides an easily accessible overview of existing evidence-based telemedicine services for use by hospital managers and health professionals, who whish to to implement telemedicine. The database is freely available and expected to be continuously improved and broadened over time.","Kidholm, Kristian; Svendsen, Ida W; Yderstræde, Knud; Ølholm, Anne M; Rayce, Kathrine; Kjølhede, Tue",Journal of telemedicine and telecare,https://doi.org/10.1177/1357633x211015585; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34000890/,597

Here, we leveraged whole-exome sequencing data from 900 CRC cases that had occurred in three US-wide prospective studies with extensive dietary and lifestyle information. We found an alkylating signature which was previously undescribed in CRC, and then showed the existence of a similar mutational process in normal colonic crypts. This alkylating signature is associated with high intakes of processed and unprocessed red meat prior to diagnosis. Additionally, this signature was more abundant in the distal colorectum, predicted to target cancer driver mutations KRAS p.G12D, KRAS p.G13D and PIK3CA p.E5454K, and associated with poor survival. Together, these results link for the first time a colorectal mutational signature to a component of diet, and further implicate the role of red meat in CRC initiation and progression.","Gurjao, Carino; Zhong, Rong; Haruki, Koichiro; Li, Yvonne Y; Spurr, Liam F; Lee-Six, Henry; Reardon, Brendan; Ugai, Tomotaka; Zhang, Xuehong; Cherniack, Andrew D; Song, Mingyang; Van Allen, Eliezer M; Meyerhardt, Jeffrey A; Nowak, Jonathan A; Giovannucci, Edward L; Fuchs, Charles S; Wu, Kana; Ogino, Shuji; Giannakis, Marios",Cancer discovery,https://doi.org/10.1158/2159-8290.cd-20-1656; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34140290/,597

The present study investigated the modulation of T-helper 17 (Th17) cell differentiation by the miR-21/Smad7/TGF-β pathway, and their roles in COPD. Lung tissues were obtained from lung cancer patients with or without COPD who underwent lobotomy and the levels of miR-21, TGF-β/Smad signaling molecules, RORγT, and other Th17-related cytokines were detected. Mouse COPD models were built by exposing both wild-type (WT) and miR-21-/- mice to cigarette smoke (CS) and cigarette smoke extract (CSE) intraperitoneal injection. Isolated primary CD4+ T cells were treated with either CS extract, miR-21 mimics or inhibitors, followed by measuring Th17 cells markers and the expression of TGF-β/Smad signaling molecules and RORγT. Increased levels of miR-21, Smad7, phosphorylated (p)-Smad2, p-Smad3, TGF-β, and Th17-related cytokines was detected in the lungs of COPD patients. Lung function in modeled WT mice, but not miR-21-/- ones, deteriorated and the number of inflammatory cells in the lung tissues increased compared to the control WT-mice. Moreover, primary CD4+ lymphocytes tend to differentiate into Th17 cells after the treatment with CSE or miR-21 mimics, and the expression of RORγT and the TGF-β/Smad signaling were all increased, however miR-21 inhibitors worked reversely. Our findings demonstrated that Th17 cells increased under COPD pathogenesis and was partially modulated by the miR-21/Smad7/TGF-β pathway.","He, Shengyang; Sun, Shenghua; Lu, Junjuan; Chen, Lili; Mei, Xiang; Li, Liqiu; Zeng, Zhengpeng; Zhong, Mubin; Xie, Lihua",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85637-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33739023/,597
90177,International Observational Analysis of Evolution and Outcomes of Chronic Stable Angina: The Multinational Observational CLARIFY Study.,2021-07-15,"Human aging is a multifactorial phenomenon that affects numerous organ systems and cellular processes, with the immune system being one of the most dysregulated. Immunosenescence, the gradual deterioration of the immune system, and inflammaging, a chronic inflammatory state that persists in the elderly, are among the plethora of immune changes that occur during aging. Almost all populations of immune cells change with age in terms of numbers and/or activity. These alterations are in general highly detrimental, resulting in an increased susceptibility to infections, reduced healing abilities, and altered homeostasis that promote the emergence of age-associated diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and other diseases associated with inflammation. Thanks to recent developments, several strategies have been proposed to target central immunological processes or specific immune subpopulations affected by aging. These therapeutic approaches could soon be applied in the clinic to slow down or even reverse specific age-induced immune changes in order to rejuvenate the immune system and prevent or reduce the impact of various diseases. Due to its systemic nature and interconnection with all the other systems in the body, the immune system is an attractive target for aging intervention because relatively targeted modifications to a small set of cells have the potential to improve the health of multiple organ systems.. Therefore, anti-aging immune targeting therapies could represent a potent approach for improving healthspan. Here, we review aging changes in the major components of the immune system, we summarize the current immune-targeting therapeutic approaches in the context of aging and discuss the future directions in the field of immune rejuvenation.","Borgoni, Simone; Kudryashova, Ksenia S; Burka, Ksenia; de Magalhães, João Pedro",Ageing research reviews,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arr.2021.101410; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34280555/,597

A plausible explanation for this liking gap is that people are constantly worrying about how others are evaluating them. If so, one would expect the liking gap to emerge in young children as they become more concerned with their reputations and the impression they make on other people. The current study (N = 241 U.S. children; age range = 4-11 years) supported this hypothesis, showing a liking gap beginning when children were 5 years old, the age at which they first become concerned with other people's evaluations of them. Moreover, the liking gap became more pronounced as children got older. These findings provide the first developmental description of the liking gap and support the hypothesis that this phenomenon is related to individuals' concerns for how others evaluate them.","Wolf, Wouter; Nafe, Amanda; Tomasello, Michael",Psychological science,https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797620980754; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33914647/,597
90577,Remodelling of specialist services enables safe reduction in hospital admissions of patients with sickle cell disease: Lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020-09-29,"Background The use of Pipeline Embolization Device (PED) is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat aneurysms located between the petrous and superior hypophyseal segments of the internal carotid artery. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of treating aneurysms outside the FDA approved anatomical locations. Furthermore, we analyze the safety of our antiplatelet protocol. Methods Data on all patients treated with PED at our center from March 2015 to December 2017 were reviewed. Only patients with aneurysms treated with PED as off label use were included. Procedural complications and long-term functional outcome measured by modified Rankin Scale (mRS) were recorded. Tirofiban maintenance infusion was administered intravenously after PED deployment. None of the patients had platelet function testing. Results A total of 36 patients harboring 36 aneurysms were included in the study. Mean age was 58.2 years ±14.6. Nineteen were women (52.8%) and most aneurysms were unruptured (80.6%). There were no intraoperative complications. Five patients experienced postoperative complications - 4 ischemic strokes and one groin hematoma. None led to any significant disability at follow-up. Thirty-one patients (86.1%) achieved an mRS of 0-2 at follow-up. A Raymond-Roy classification of 1 was achieved in 78.9% of patients. Conclusion The use of PED to treat aneurysms located outside the circle of Willis is feasible and effective. Our novel antiplatelet protocol did not require platelet function assay testing and did not lead to a higher rate of thrombo-embolic events compared to what has been previously reported.","Al Kasab, Sami; Guerrero, Waldo R; Nakagawa, Daichi; Samaniego, Edgar A; Ortega-Gutierrez, Santiago; Hasan, David",Interventional neurology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000495074; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32508889/,597

91158,Emails provide staff support through COVID-19.,2021-04-22,"Acute respiratory infections caused by bacterial or viral pathogens are among the most common reasons for seeking medical care. Despite improvements in pathogen-based diagnostics, most patients receive inappropriate antibiotics. Host response biomarkers offer an alternative diagnostic approach to direct antimicrobial use. This observational cohort study determined whether host gene expression patterns discriminate noninfectious from infectious illness and bacterial from viral causes of acute respiratory infection in the acute care setting. Peripheral whole blood gene expression from 273 subjects with community-onset acute respiratory infection (ARI) or noninfectious illness, as well as 44 healthy controls, was measured using microarrays. Sparse logistic regression was used to develop classifiers for bacterial ARI (71 probes), viral ARI (33 probes), or a noninfectious cause of illness (26 probes). Overall accuracy was 87% (238 of 273 concordant with clinical adjudication), which was more accurate than procalcitonin (78%, P < 0.03) and three published classifiers of bacterial versus viral infection (78 to 83%). The classifiers developed here externally validated in five publicly available data sets (AUC, 0.90 to 0.99). A sixth publicly available data set included 25 patients with co-identification of bacterial and viral pathogens. Applying the ARI classifiers defined four distinct groups: a host response to bacterial ARI, viral ARI, coinfection, and neither a bacterial nor a viral response. These findings create an opportunity to develop and use host gene expression classifiers as diagnostic platforms to combat inappropriate antibiotic use and emerging antibiotic resistance.","Tsalik, Ephraim L; Henao, Ricardo; Nichols, Marshall; Burke, Thomas; Ko, Emily R; McClain, Micah T; Hudson, Lori L; Mazur, Anna; Freeman, Debra H; Veldman, Tim; Langley, Raymond J; Quackenbush, Eugenia B; Glickman, Seth W; Cairns, Charles B; Jaehne, Anja K; Rivers, Emanuel P; Otero, Ronny M; Zaas, Aimee K; Kingsmore, Stephen F; Lucas, Joseph; Fowler, Vance G; Carin, Lawrence; Ginsburg, Geoffrey S; Woods, Christopher W",Science translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.aad6873; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26791949/,597

Four human retroviruses are currently known, including human immunodeficiency virus type 1, which causes AIDS, and human T-lymphotropic virus type 1, which causes cancer and inflammatory disease. For many years, there have been sporadic reports of additional human retroviral infections, particularly in cancer and other chronic diseases. Unfortunately, many of these putative viruses remain unproven and controversial, and some retrovirologists have dismissed them as merely ""human rumor viruses."" Work in this field was last reviewed in depth in 1984, and since then, the molecular techniques available for identifying and characterizing retroviruses have improved enormously in sensitivity. The advent of PCR in particular has dramatically enhanced our ability to detect novel viral sequences in human tissues. However, DNA amplification techniques have also increased the potential for false-positive detection due to contamination. In addition, the presence of many families of human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) within our DNA can obstruct attempts to identify and validate novel human retroviruses. Here, we aim to bring together the data on ""novel"" retroviral infections in humans by critically examining the evidence for those putative viruses that have been linked with disease and the likelihood that they represent genuine human infections. We provide a background to the field and a discussion of potential confounding factors along with some technical guidelines. In addition, some of the difficulties associated with obtaining formal proof of causation for common or ubiquitous agents such as HERVs are discussed.","Voisset, Cécile; Weiss, Robin A; Griffiths, David J",Microbiology and molecular biology reviews : MMBR,https://doi.org/10.1128/mmbr.00033-07; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18322038/,597

We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and reproducibility of a simple intraoperative visual liver score to stratify the risk of NASH and NAFLD in obesity and determine the need for liver biopsy. METHODS This is a prospective cohort study of obese adults undergoing bariatric surgery. The surgical team used a visual liver score to evaluate liver colour, size and surface. This was compared to histology from an intraoperative liver biopsy. RESULTS There were 152 participants, age 44.6 ± 12 years, BMI 45 ± 8.3 kg/m2. Prevalence of NAFLD was 70.4%, with 12.1% NASH and 26.4% borderline NASH. Single-visual components were less accurate than total composite score. Steatosis was most accurately identified (significant steatosis: AUROC 0.746, p < 0.05; severe steatosis: AUROC 0.855, p < 0.05). NASH was identified with moderate accuracy (AUROC 0.746, p = 0.001), with sensitivity 75% for a score ≥ 2. Stratification into low (≤ 1) and high-risk (≥ 4) scores accurately identified patients who should or should not have an intraoperative biopsy. Most patients with a normal-appearing liver did not have disease (94.4%). The structured visual assessment was quick and interobserver agreement was reasonable (κ = 0.53, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS A simple, structured tool based on liver appearance can be a useful and reliable tool for NAFLD risk stratification and identification of patients who would most and least benefit from a biopsy. A normal liver appearance reliably excludes significant liver disease, avoiding the need for liver biopsy in patients otherwise at high clinical risk of NASH.","Ooi, Geraldine J; Burton, Paul R; Earnest, Arul; Laurie, Cheryl; Kemp, William W; Nottle, Peter D; McLean, Catriona A; Roberts, Stuart K; Brown, Wendy A",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-017-2859-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28776153/,597

Development of different IST based analogues acquired significant awareness because of its pronounced therapeutic importance such as analgesic, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antitubercular, antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral (effective against SARS coronavirus 3C protease) and many other activities, and represent an important class of heterocyclic compounds that can be used as a precursor for the synthesis of many useful drugs. OBJECTIVE Previously many articles were reported on IST synthesis and their different pharmacological activities but herein, we mentioned 59 different synthesis schemes of several IST derivatives/hybrids derived from the substitution of the nitrogen, aromatic ring, the second and third position of IST along with most potent molecule among each of synthesized libraries with their structural activity relationship (SAR). Using these standardized approaches several biological important compounds were developed like sunitinib, nintedanib, indirubin, etc and several studies have been carried out in nowadays to develop newer compounds having fewer side effects and also overcome the problem of resistance. CONCLUSION This report critically reviews the different strategies for the designs and synthesis of several IST based compounds having different biological activities with SAR which can favour further investigation and modification for the development of new and more potent entities.","Chauhan, Garima; Pathak, Dharam Pal; Ali, Faraat; Bhutani, Rubina; Kapoor, Garima; Khasimbi, Shaik",Current organic synthesis,https://doi.org/10.2174/1570179417666200924150907; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32972348/,597

To summarize proposed underlying mechanisms for their influence. METHODS We reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Scoping Review extension. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AgeLine, Cochrane Library, and reference lists of retrieved studies for studies of prognostic factor/s of postoperative in-hospital medical complication/s among patients 50 years and older treated surgically for non-pathological closed hip fracture, published in English on January 2008-January 2018. We excluded studies of surgery type or in-hospital medications. Screening was duplicated by two independent reviewers. One reviewer completed the extraction with accuracy checks by the second reviewer. We summarized the extent, nature, and proposed underlying mechanisms for the prognostic factors of complications narratively and in a dependency graph. RESULTS We identified 44 prognostic factors of in-hospital complications after hip fracture surgery from 56 studies. Of these, we identified 7 patient factors-dehydration, anemia, hypotension, heart rate variability, pressure risk, nutrition, and indwelling catheter use; and 7 process factors-time to surgery, anesthetic type, transfusion strategy, orthopedic versus geriatric/co-managed care, multidisciplinary care pathway, and potentially modifiable during index hospitalization. We identified underlying mechanisms for 15 of 44 factors. The reported association between 12 prognostic factors and complications was inconsistent across studies. CONCLUSIONS Most factors were reported by one study with no proposed underlying mechanism for their influence. Where reported by more than one study, there was inconsistency in reported associations and the conceptualization of complications differed, limiting comparison across studies. It is therefore not possible to be certain whether intervening on these factors would reduce the rate of complications after hip fracture surgery.","Sheehan, K J; Guerrero, E M; Tainter, D; Dial, B; Milton-Cole, R; Blair, J A; Alexander, J; Swamy, P; Kuramoto, L; Guy, P; Bettger, J P; Sobolev, B",Osteoporosis international : a journal established as result of cooperation between the European Foundation for Osteoporosis and the National Osteoporosis Foundation of the USA,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00198-019-04976-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31037362/,597

We first revisit these ""4C's""-first Contact, Continuity, Comprehensiveness, and Coordination-and how they might inform design thinking in primary care GME guideline revision. We also propose the addition of Community engagement, patient-Centeredness, and Complexity. Training residents to deliver on these ""7C's,"" functions critical to the delivery of high-performing primary care, is essential if family medicine residency graduates are to serve the clearly articulated, but unrealized, quadruple aim for US health care: improved patient experience and population health at lower costs while preserving clinician well-being. Finally, we highlight and illustrate examples of four critical enablers of these 7C core functions of primary care that must be accommodated in training guidelines and reform, suggesting a need for resident competencies in Team-based, Tool- and Technology-enabled, Tailored (""4T's"") care of patients and populations.","Bazemore, Andrew; Grunert, Timothy",Family medicine,https://doi.org/10.22454/fammed.2021.383659; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33970469/,597

Evidence has shown increased mortality rates associated with COVID-19 infection. However, little is known about the outcomes of COVID-19 negative patients in a pandemic environment. In addition, the impact of vitamin D levels on mortality in COVID-19 hip fracture patients has yet to be determined. METHODS This multicentre observational study included 1,633 patients who sustained a hip fracture across nine hospital trusts in North West England. Data were collected for three months from March 2020 and for the same period in 2019. Patients were matched by Nottingham Hip Fracture Score (NHFS), hospital, and fracture type. We looked at the mortality outcomes of COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative patients sustaining a hip fracture. We also looked to see if Vitamin D levels had an impact on mortality. RESULTS The demographics of the 2019 and 2020 groups were similar, with a slight increase in proportion of male patients in the 2020 group. The 30-day mortality was 35.6% in COVID-19 positive patients and 7.8% in the COVID-19 negative patients. There was a potential association of decreasing vitamin D levels and increasing mortality rates for COVID-19 positive patients although our findings did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION In 2020 there was a significant increase in 30-day mortality rates of patients who were COVID-19 positive but not of patients who were COVID-19 negative. Low levels of vitamin D may be associated with high mortality rates in COVID-19 positive patients.","Mahmood, Aatif; Rashid, Fatima; Limb, Richard; Cash, Thomas; Nagy, Mathias Thomas; Zreik, Nasri; Reddy, Gautam; Jaly, Ibrahim; As-Sultany, Mohammed; Chan, Yuen Ting Carol; Wilson, Graeme; Harrison, W J",The bone & joint journal,https://doi.org/10.1302/0301-620x.103b.bjj-2020-1862.r1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33507811/,597
94581,COVID-19 Moves Medicine into a Virtual Space: A Paradigm Shift From Touch to Talk to Establish Trust.,2020-08-01,"Surface phonon polaritons (SPhPs) are hybrid light-matter states in which light strongly couples to lattice vibrations inside the Reststrahlen band of polar dielectrics at mid-infrared frequencies. Antennas supporting localized surface phonon polaritons (LSPhPs) easily outperform their plasmonic counterparts operating in the visible or near-infrared in terms of field enhancement and confinement thanks to the inherently slower phonon-phonon scattering processes governing SPhPs decay. In particular, LSPhPs antennas have attracted considerable interest for thermal management at the nanoscale, where the emission strongly diverts from the usual far-field blackbody radiation due to the presence of evanescent waves at the surface. However, far-field measurements cannot shed light on the behavior of antennas in the near-field region. To overcome this limitation, we employ scattering-scanning near field optical microscopy (sSNOM) to unveil the spectral near-field response of 3C-SiC antenna arrays. We present a detailed description of the behavior of the antenna resonances by comparing far-field and near-field spectra, and demonstrate the existence of a mode with no net dipole moment, absent in the far-field spectra, but of importance for applications that exploit the heightened electromagnetic near fields. Furthermore, we investigate the perturbation in the antenna response induced by the presence of the AFM tip, which can be further extended towards situations where for example strong IR emitters couple to LSPhPs modes.","Mancini, Andrea; Gubbin, Christopher R; Berté, Rodrigo; Martini, Francesco; Politi, Alberto; Cortés, Emiliano; Li, Yi; De Liberato, Simone; Maier, Stefan A",ACS nano,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.0c02784; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32530605/,597

95016,Delay in Cancer Screening and Diagnosis During the COVID-19 Pandemic: What Is the Cost?,2020-09-15,"AIM To access the incidence and predictive factors of incisional hernia after single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC). METHODS Eighty-two consecutive patients operated on for uncomplicated cholelithiasis between 2009 and 2013 were eligible for the study. Clinical outcome was assessed by a combination of case notes review, office consultation and telephone interview. Long-term incisional hernia rate was the major outcome of the study. Secondary outcome was the evaluation of predictive factors. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were performed using the following variables: age, gender, ASA score, BMI, risk, or comorbidity factors and surgical site infection. RESULTS Six patients (7 %) were lost to follow-up after the 1-month office visit and excluded. The study group consisted of 16 men and 60 women with a median age of 42 years (range 18-69) and a BMI of 25 (range 19-34). Eight patients had risk or comorbidity factors, 46 were classified ASA I, and 30 ASA II. Early postoperative course was uneventful in all cases but two patients developed a superficial wound abscess after hospital discharge. With a median follow-up of 44 months (range 12-72), incisional hernia was noted in six patients (7.9 %). Multivariate logistic analysis revealed that age (OR 1.08, 95 % CI 1.00-1.16, p < 0.038) and BMI (OR 1.37, 95 % CI 1.03-1.82, p < 0.029) were independent predictive factors of developing an incisional hernia. The incidence of hernia was, respectively, 15 % in patients with an age ≥ 50 and 33 % in patients with a BMI ≥ 30. CONCLUSION After SILC, we noted an incisional hernia rate of 8 %. To decrease the risk of developing that specific complication, SILC should only be proposed to young and non-obese patients.","Julliard, O; Hauters, P; Possoz, J; Malvaux, P; Landenne, J; Gherardi, D",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-016-4790-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26895902/,597

The symposium has been organized in the United States every 4 years since, followed by a research conference to (a) assess major research accomplishments, (b) identify important research questions and opportunities, (c) develop consensus on definitions and terminology, and (d) establish priorities with short- and long-term research goals. One of the principal areas reviewed quadrennially is Epidemiology, Natural History, and Risk Factors. OBJECTIVE To provide a review of recent literature on the epidemiology, natural history, and risk factors for OM. DATA SOURCES AND REVIEW METHODS A search of OM articles in English published July 2007 to June 2011 was conducted using PubMed and related databases. Those with findings judged of importance for epidemiology, public health, and/or statistical methods were reviewed. RESULTS The literature has continued to expand, increasing understanding of the worldwide burden of OM in childhood, complications from treatment failures, and comorbidities. Novel risk factors, including genetic factors, have been examined for OM susceptibility. Population-based studies in Canada, the United States, and other countries confirmed reductions in OM prevalence. Although most studies concentrated on acute OM (AOM) or OM with effusion (OME), a few examined severe chronic suppurative OM (CSOM), a major public health problem in developing countries and for certain indigenous populations around the world. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Recent publications have reinforced earlier epidemiological findings, while extending our knowledge in human population groups with high burden of OM.","Hoffman, Howard J; Daly, Kathleen A; Bainbridge, Kathleen E; Casselbrant, Margaretha L; Homøe, Preben; Kvestad, Ellen; Kvaerner, Kari Jorunn; Vernacchio, Louis",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/0194599812460984; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23536527/,597

The advantages of a stable magnified 3-D view, tremor filtering, and motion scaling allow for precise intracorporeal exposure and suturing. Because most surgeries are performed as reconstructive rather than excision procedures, the robotic platform is particularly feasible for the field of pediatric urology. In this review, we summarize the recent viewpoints on RALS, such as pyeloplasty, ureteral reimplantation, bladder neck reconstruction, bladder neck sling, appendicovesicostomy, bladder diverticulectomy, and treatments for ureterocele or ectopic ureters, and we also critically summarize the current status of the literature. Based on our initial experience, RALS is technically feasible for pediatric patients and may be achieved with comparable surgical outcomes. RALS is also associated with reduced morbidity compared to open surgery to conventional laparoscopic surgery. This evolution will offer an alternative in the treatment pediatric patients, along with improved care and patient quality of life. Further large case series and randomized controlled trials that investigate the robotic platform's technological improvements will help to expand indications of RALS in the field of pediatric urology.","Mizuno, Kentaro; Kojima, Yoshiyuki; Nishio, Hidenori; Hoshi, Seiji; Sato, Yuichi; Hayashi, Yutaro",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ases.12653; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30264441/,597

However, few reports have described the use of complete single-port access surgeries in hepatectomy for neoplasms. METHODS The authors performed single-port laparoscopic hepatectomy (SLH) for eight patients (5 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, 1 patient with metastatic liver tumor, 1 patient with endocrine liver tumor, and 1 patient with hemangioma). Furthermore, in terms of Child-Pugh classification, five patients were in category A, two in category B, and one in category C. The patients were eligible for SLH if they had solitary tumors measuring 3 cm or smaller on the caudal surface of the liver. The lesion was approached through a 20-mm supraumbilical incision using a single-port access device. RESULTS No patient experienced intraoperative complications that required additional port access and conversion to laparotomy. The operative time was 148 min (range, 141-235 min). The postoperative course of the patients was uneventful, and they were discharged an average of 6.2 days (range, 3-11 days) after the operation. Approximately 2 weeks after discharge, the patients experienced no wound pain or liver dysfunction. CONCLUSION The SLH technique is a safe and feasible procedure for a specific group of candidates, including patients with high-grade liver dysfunction.","Aikawa, Masayasu; Miyazawa, Mitsuo; Okamoto, Kojun; Toshimitsu, Yasuko; Okada, Katsuya; Ueno, Yosuke; Yamaguchi, Shigeki; Koyama, Isamu",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-2095-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22179479/,597

Here, a single-step, sensitive, specific, and simple luciferase assay was developed, using the olive flounder cyp1a1 gene, for effective detection of CYP1A-inducing contaminants in coastal sediments. The developed cyp1a1-luciferase assay was highly sensitive to the widely used CYP1A inducers 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), and 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 126). In the case of TCDD, significant dose-dependent increases in luciferase activity (0.3-300 ng/L) were detected. The assay was more sensitive to PCB 126 than to B[a]P. The assay also involved the highly sensitive expression of luciferase to extracted mixtures of PCBs and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) collected from coastal sediments. PCBs were more capable of cyp1a1 induction in the assay system at small doses than PAHs in environmental samples. Using the cyp1a1-luciferase assay along with water or sediment chemistry will certainly aid in diagnosing CYP1A-inducing contaminants in coastal environments.","Jung, Jee-Hyun; Yim, Bora; Jeong, Sol; Yoon, Mee-Sup; Kim, Bo-Mi; Ha, Sung Yong; Kim, Moonkoo; Rhee, Jae-Sung; Lee, Young-Mi",Environmental science & technology,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.0c06921; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33197181/,597

We conducted a review with meta-analysis to provide summary estimates of effect of family history of pain on childhood MSK pain, and explore whether specific family pain factors influence the strength of the association (PROSPERO CRD42018090130). Included studies reported associations between family history of pain and non-specific MSK pain in children (age <19 years). The outcome of interest was MSK pain in children. We assessed the methodological quality using a modified version of the Quality in Prognosis Studies instrument, and quality of evidence for the main analyses using the GRADE criteria. After screening of 7281 titles; six longitudinal and 23 cross-sectional studies were included. Moderate quality evidence from five longitudinal studies (n=42131) showed that children with family history of MSK pain had 58% increased odds of experiencing MSK pain themselves (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.20 to 2.09). Moderate quality evidence from 18 cross-sectional studies (n=17274) supported this finding (OR 2.02, 95% 1.69 to 2.42). Subgroup analyses showed that the relationship was robust regardless of whether a child's mother, father or sibling experienced pain. Odds were higher when both parents reported pain compared to one [(mother OR=1.61; father OR=1.59); both parents OR=2.0].

Transfusion of allogeneic blood, while necessary, is not benign, and has been associated with increased rates of wound complication, venous thromboembolism, delirium, and death. PURPOSE To develop a prediction tool capable of predicting IOBL and risk of requiring allogeneic transfusion in patients undergoing surgery for vertebral column tumors. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING Retrospective, single-center study PATIENT SAMPLE: Consecutive series of 274 patients undergoing 350 unique operations for primary or metastatic spinal column tumors over a 46-month period at a comprehensive cancer center OUTCOME MEASURES: IOBL (in mL), use of intraoperative blood products, and intraoperative blood products transfused METHODS: We identified IOBL and transfusions, along with demographic data, pre-operative laboratory data, and surgical procedures performed. Independent predictors of IOBL and transfusion risk were identified using multivariable regression. RESULTS Mean age at surgery was 57.0±13.6 years, 53.1% were male, and 67.1% were treated for metastatic lesions. Independent predictors of IOBL included en bloc resection (p<0.001), surgical invasiveness (β=25.43 per point; p<0.001), and pre-operative albumin (β= -244.86 per g/dL; p=0.011). Predictors of transfusion risk included pre-operative hematocrit (odds ratio=0.88 per %; 95% confidence interval [0.84, 0.93]; p<0.001), pre-operative MCHgb (OR=0.88 per pg; 95%CI [0.78, 1.00]; p=0.048), preoperative red cell distribution width (OR=1.32 per %; 95%CI [1.13, 1.55]; p<0.001), en bloc resection (OR=3.17; 95%CI [1.33, 7.54]; p=0.009), and surgical invasiveness (OR=1.08 per point; [1.06; 1.11]; p<0.001). The transfusion model showed a good fit of the data with an optimism-corrected area under the curve of 0.819. A freely available, web-based calculator was developed for the transfusion risk model (https://jhuspine3.shinyapps.io/TRUST/). CONCLUSIONS Here we present the first clinical calculator for intraoperative blood loss and transfusion risk in patients being treated for primary or metastatic vertebral column tumors. Surgical invasiveness and pre-operative microcytic anemia most strongly predict transfusion risk. The resultant calculators may prove clinically useful for surgeons counseling patients about their individual risk of requiring allogeneic transfusion.","Pennington, Zach; Ehresman, Jeff; Feghali, James; Schilling, Andrew; Hersh, Andrew; Hung, Bethany; Lubelski, Daniel; Sciubba, Daniel M",The spine journal : official journal of the North American Spine Society,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.spinee.2020.09.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33007469/,597

OBJECTIVE The aim is to describe academic burnout and clarify the relationships between academic burnout, academic engagement, and psychological capital among nursing students in traditional Chinese medicine universities. DESIGN This is a cross-sectional, descriptive study. SETTING The study sampled a four-year undergraduate traditional Chinese medicine university in Jian, Shandong Province, China. PARTICIPANTS A convenience sampling method was used to select 733 nursing students from April to June 2020. METHODS The Academic Burnout Scale, the Positive Psychological Capital Scale, and the Academic Engagement Scale were used for data collection, in addition to social-demographic data. Path analysis was used to clarify the relationships among academic burnout, academic engagement and psychological capital. RESULTS Of all the study participants, 39.29% had a certain degree of academic burnout. Academic engagement and psychological capital were negatively correlated with academic burnout among nursing students in traditional Chinese medicine university. Psychological capital was positively correlated with academic engagement. CONCLUSION Nursing students had a certain degree of academic burnout.

In the past 40 decades, there have been many innovations in the development of low-cost and efficacious technologies for WASH and household air pollution, but many of these technologies have been associated with disappointing health outcomes, often because low-income households have either not adopted, or inconsistently adopted, these technologies. In this Viewpoint, we argue that public health researchers (ourselves included) have had an oversimplified understanding of poverty; our work has not focused on insights into the lived experience of poverty, with its uncertainties, stresses from constant scarcity, and attendant fears. Such insights are central to understanding why technologies for safe water or clean cooking are unused by so many households that could benefit from them. We argue that, rather than improved versions of household-scale delivery models, transformative investments in safe water and clean cooking for all require utility-scale service models. Until then, research should focus on interim safe water and clean cooking options that are directed towards the utility-scale service model.","Ray, Isha; Smith, Kirk R",The Lancet.

Its sweetness is 70% that of sucrose. d-allulose is a metabolic regulator of glucose and lipid metabolism. However, few reports concerning its effect on diabetes and related metabolic disturbances in db/db mice are available. In this study, we evaluated d-allulose's effect on hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, diabetes and inflammatory responses in C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice. Mice were divided into normal diet, erythritol supplemented (5% w/w), and d-allulose supplemented (5% w/w) groups. Blood glucose and plasma glucagon levels and homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR) were significantly lower in the d-allulose group than in the normal diet group, and plasma insulin level was significantly increased. Further, d-allulose supplement significantly increased hepatic glucokinase activity and decreased hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose-6-phosphatase activity. Expression of glucose transporter 4, insulin receptor substrate 1, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha and AKT serine/threonine kinase 2 were also upregulated by d-allulose supplement in adipocyte and muscle. Finally, d-allulose effectively lowered plasma and hepatic triglyceride and free fatty acid levels, and simultaneously reduced hepatic fatty acid oxidation and carnitine palmitoyl transferase activity. These changes are likely attributable to suppression of hepatic fatty acid synthase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity. Notably, d-allulose also reduced pro-inflammatory adipokine and cytokine levels in plasma. Our results indicate that d-allulose is an effective sugar substitute for improving lipid and glucose metabolism.","Lee, Dayoun; Han, Youngji; Kwon, Eun-Young; Choi, Myung-Sook",Molecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules25163656; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32796637/,597

The present study was conducted to compare the effect of short-term supplementation at 200 mg/d of either alpha-tocopherol or a tocotrienol-rich fraction (TRF) from palm oil on immune modulation and plasma vitamin E levels in normal healthy Asian volunteers. In a randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trial conducted, fifty-three healthy volunteers aged 20-50 years were recruited based on the study's inclusion and exclusion criteria. They were randomly assigned into three groups, i.e. two experimental groups that received daily supplementation at 200 mg of either alpha-tocopherol or the TRF, and the control group that received a placebo. Blood was drawn on days 0, 28 and 56 for several laboratory analyses. Differences in the production of IL-4 or interferon-gamma by concanavalin A-stimulated lymphocytes isolated from these volunteers were not significant (P>0.05). There were no significant differences observed in immune parameters between the healthy volunteers who received daily supplementation with either alpha-tocopherol or the TRF. As these observations were made in the absence of any immunogenic challenge, we feel it would be of benefit to study if there would be any differences observed when an immunogenic challenge such as vaccination were introduced.","Radhakrishnan, Ammu K; Lee, Ai-Ling; Wong, Pak-Fong; Kaur, Jagmohni; Aung, Htin; Nesaretnam, Kalanithi",The British journal of nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0007114508039998; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18702848/,597
102238,Going virtual for research training during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond: e-SORT IT.,2021-09-29,"Although there has been increasing focus in recent years on interdisciplinary approaches to health and disease, and in particular the dimension of social inequalities in epidemics, infectious diseases have been much less focused on. This is especially true in the area of cultural dynamics and their effects on pathogen behaviours, although there is evidence to suggest that this relationship is central to shaping our interactions with infectious disease agents on a variety of levels. This paper makes a case for a biocultural approach to pandemics such as COVID-19. It then uses this biocultural framework to examine the anthropogenic dynamics that influenced and continue to shape the COVID-19 pandemic, both during its initial phase and during critical intersections of the pandemic. Through this understanding of biocultural interactions between people, animals and pathogens, a broader societal and political dimension is drawn as a function of population level and international cultures, to reflect on the culturally mediated differential burden of the pandemic. Ultimately, it is argued that a biocultural perspective on infectious disease pandemics will allow for critical reflection on how culture shapes our behaviours at all levels, and how the effects of these behaviours are ultimately foundational to pathogen ecology and evolution.","Friedler, Anna",Global public health,https://doi.org/10.1080/17441692.2020.1828982; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33019889/,597

Procedures such as external ventricular drain (EVD) and ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) usually carry a very low rate of complications. However, as flow diverting stents such as Pipeline Embolization Device (PED) become more widely available, flow diverters are being used in treatment of some ruptured complex aneurysms. EVD and VPS placement in the setting of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAT) in these patients are associated with a significant risk of intracranial hemorrhage. We describe a management strategy and surgical technique that can minimize hemorrhagic complications associated with VPS in patients on DAT after treatment with flow diverting stents.","Tan, Lee A; Gerard, Carter S; Keigher, Kiffon M; Moftakhar, Roham; Lopes, Demetrius K",Journal of cerebrovascular and endovascular neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.7461/jcen.2015.17.1.54; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25874187/,597
102509,The Development of a Surgical Oncology Center During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2021-03-01,"OBJECTIVE The frequency and seasonality of viruses in tropical regions are scarcely reported. We estimated the frequency of 7 respiratory viruses and assessed seasonality of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza viruses in a tropical city. METHODS Children (age≤18 years) with acute respiratory infection were investigated in Salvador, Brazil, between July 2014 and June 2017. Respiratory viruses were searched by direct immunofluorescence and real-time polymerase chain reaction for detection of RSV, influenza A virus, influenza B virus, adenovirus (ADV) and parainfluenza viruses (PIV) 1, 2 and 3. Seasonal distribution was evaluated by Prais-Winsten regression. Due to similar distribution, influenza A and influenza B viruses were grouped to analyze seasonality. RESULTS The study group comprised 387 cases whose median (IQR) age was 26.4 (10.5-50.1) months. Respiratory viruses were detected in 106 (27.4%) cases. RSV (n=76; 19.6%), influenza A virus (n=11; 2.8%), influenza B virus (n=7; 1.8%), ADV (n=5; 1.3%), PIV 1 (n=5; 1.3%), PIV 3 (n=3; 0.8%), and PIV 2 (n=1; 0.3%) were identified. Monthly count of RSV cases demonstrated seasonal distribution (b3=0.626; p=0.003). More than half (42/76 [55.3%]) of all RSV cases were detected from April to June. Monthly count of influenza cases also showed seasonal distribution (b3=-0.264; p=0.032). Influenza cases peaked from November to January with 44.4% (8/18) of all influenza cases. CONCLUSIONS RSV was the most frequently detected virus. RSV and influenza viruses showed seasonal distribution. These data may be useful to plan the best time to carry out prophylaxis and to increase the number of hospital beds.","Santos, Ruth-Kelly O; Borges, Igor C; Souza, Mariana L; Bouzas, Maiara L; Nascimento-Carvalho, Cristiana M",Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH,https://doi.org/10.1111/tmi.13571; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33666303/,597
102558,CORR® International-Asia-Pacific: Closing the Loop-Focus Early and Often on Your Patients' Postsurgical Rehabilitation Program.,2020-09-04,"Information processing underlying human perceptual decision-making is inherently noisy and identifying sources of this noise is important to understand processing. Ratcliff, Voskuilen, and McKoon (2018) examined results from five experiments using a double-pass procedure in which stimuli were repeated typically a hundred trials later. Greater than chance agreement between repeated tests provided evidence for trial-to-trial variability from external sources of noise. They applied the diffusion model to estimate the quality of evidence driving the decision process (drift rate) and the variability (standard deviation) in drift rate across trials. This variability can be decomposed into random (internal) and systematic (external) components by comparing the double-pass accuracy and agreement with the model predictions. In this note, we provide an additional analysis of the double-pass experiments using the linear ballistic accumulator (LBA) model. The LBA model does not have within-trial variability and thus it captures all variability in processing with its across-trial variability parameters. The LBA analysis of the double-pass data provides model-based evidence of external variability in a decision process, which is consistent with Ratcliff et al.'s result. This demonstrates that across-trial variability is required to model perceptual decision-making. The LBA model provides measures of systematic and random variability as the diffusion model did. But due to the lack of within-trial variability, the LBA model estimated the random component as a larger proportion of across-trial total variability than did the diffusion model.","Kang, Inhan; Ratcliff, Roger; Voskuilen, Chelsea",Journal of mathematical psychology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmp.2020.102431; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32831400/,597

This study utilises long period grating (LPG) optical fibre sensors, incorporated into the lumen of endotracheal tubes (ETTs), to monitor in real time, Pseudomonas aeruginosa surface colonisation and biofilm formation. The wavelength shift of LPG attenuation bands was monitored for 24 h and compared with biofilm biomass, quantified using confocal fluorescence microscopy imaging. Biofilm formation was compared on uncoated ETTs and optical fibres, and on a biofilm resistant acrylate polymer, after challenge in an artificial sputum or minimal growth medium (RPMI-1640). The LPG sensor was able to detect a biofilm biomass as low as 81 μg cm-2, by comparison with the confocal image quantification. An empirical exponential function was found to link the optical attenuation wavelength shift with the inverse of the biofilm biomass, allowing quantification of biofouling from the spectral response. Quantification from the sensor allows infection interception and early device removal, to reduce, for example, the risk of ventilator associated pneumonia.","Kurmoo, Yasin; Hook, Andrew L; Harvey, Daniel; Dubern, Jean-Frédéric; Williams, Paul; Morgan, Stephen P; Korposh, Serhiy; Alexander, Morgan R",Biomaterials science,https://doi.org/10.1039/c9bm00875f; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31965132/,597

104997,"COVID-19 and Postinfection Immunity: Limited Evidence, Many Remaining Questions.",2020-05-11,"Pneumonia is a serious complication associated with inflammation of the lungs due to infection with viral pathogens. Seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses, variola virus (agent of smallpox) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; agent of COVID-19) are some leading examples. Viral pneumonia is triggered by excessive inflammation associated with dysregulated cytokine production, termed 'cytokine storm'. Several cytokines have been implicated but tumour necrosis factor (TNF) plays a critical role in driving lung inflammation, severe lung pathology and death. Despite this, the exact role TNF plays in the aetiology and pathogenesis of virus infection-induced respiratory complications is not well understood. In this review, we discuss the pathological and immunomodulatory roles of TNF in contributing to immunopathology and resolution of lung inflammation, respectively, in mouse models of influenza- and smallpox (mousepox)-induced pneumonia. We review studies that have investigated dampening of inflammation on the outcome of severe influenza and orthopoxvirus infections. Most studies on the influenza model have evaluated the efficacy of treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs, including anti-TNF agents, in animal models on the day of viral infection. We question the merits of those studies as they are not transferable to the clinic given that individuals generally present at a hospital only after the onset of disease symptoms and not on the day of infection. We propose that research should be directed at determining whether dampening lung inflammation after the onset of disease symptoms will reduce morbidity and mortality. Such a treatment strategy will be more relevant clinically.","Pandey, Pratikshya; Karupiah, Gunasegaran",The FEBS journal,https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.15782; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33624419/,597

METHODS We searched the Medline database to specifically identify review articles relating to biologic mesh and VHR and critically reviewed these studies using an evidence-based approach. RESULTS For the past 45 years, four clinical reviews and one systematic review have included biologic meshes as part of a larger discussion on available prosthetics for VHR. All reviews supported biologic mesh use, especially in the setting of contaminated fields. Yet, the primary literature included in these reviews and served as the basis for these conclusions consisted entirely of case series and case reports, which have the lowest level of evidence in determining scientific validity. Furthermore, the FDA has neither cleared nor approved this particular use. CONCLUSIONS The cumulative data regarding biologic mesh use in VHRs under contaminated conditions does not support the claim that it is better than synthetic mesh used under the same conditions. The highly promoted and at least moderately utilized practice of placing biologic mesh in contamination is being done outside of the original intended use, and a re-evaluation of or possible moratorium on biologic mesh use in hernia surgery is seriously warranted. Alternatively, an industry-sponsored national registry of patients in whom ventral hernia repairs involved biologic mesh would substantively add to our understanding regarding how these intriguing biomaterials are being used and their overall clinical efficacy.","Primus, F E; Harris, H W",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-012-1037-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23296600/,597

AIM To determine if adding histology as a criterion and excluding patients with epigastric pain enhances the diagnosis for GERD. METHODS Patients with frequent upper gastrointestinal symptoms who had not taken a proton pump inhibitor in the previous 2 months and who had evaluable distal oesophageal biopsies were included (Diamond study: NCT00291746). Epithelial hyperplasia was identified when total epithelial thickness was at least 430 μm. Investigation-based GERD criteria were: presence of erosive oesophagitis, pathological oesophageal acid exposure and/or positive symptom-acid association probability. Symptoms were assessed using the Reflux Disease Questionnaire and a pre-specified checklist. RESULTS Overall, 127 (55%) of the 231 included patients met investigation-based GERD criteria and 195 (84%) met symptom-based criteria. Epithelial hyperplasia was present in 89 individuals, of whom 61 (69%) met investigation-based criteria and 83 (93%) met symptom-based criteria. Adding epithelial hyperplasia as a criterion increased the number of patients diagnosed with GERD on investigation by 28 [12%; number needed to diagnose (NND): 8], to 155 (67%). The proportion of patients with a symptom-based GERD diagnosis who met investigation-based criteria including epithelial hyperplasia was significantly greater when concomitant epigastric pain was absent than when it was present (P < 0.05; NND: 8). CONCLUSIONS Histology increases diagnosis of GERD and should be performed when clinical suspicion is high and endoscopy is negative. Excluding patients with epigastric pain enhances sensitivity for the diagnosis of GERD.","Vakil, N; Vieth, M; Wernersson, B; Wissmar, J; Dent, J",Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1111/apt.14028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28318045/,597

METHODS A survey was disseminated to DBP clinicians through contact with international professional organizations to determine the use of telehealth in DBP care, before and since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Descriptive statistics and χ2 tests were used for analysis. RESULTS A total of 271 respondents from 38 countries completed the survey. The number of respondents offering telehealth increased from 36% to 88% after the pandemic, with the greatest shift to telehealth among high-income countries (HICs). Among respondents using telehealth, 75.1% were conducting interactive video visits, with HICs using more telehealth modalities embedded in electronic health records. Most patients (98.7%) were at home for the telehealth encounter. Almost half (46.5%) could not include an interpreter in telehealth visits. Barriers reported by telehealth users included concerns about limited patient access to technology (74.3%), home environment distractions (56.5%), preference for in-person care (53.6%), telehealth effectiveness (48.1%), workflow efficiency (42.2%), and cost/reimbursement (32.1%). CONCLUSION Global DBP clinicians rapidly adopted telehealth and continued to have interprofessional practice while doing so, with the largest adoption occurring in HICs. Provider concerns about effectiveness and patient access to technology emerged as key organizational and patient barriers, respectively. Increased provider confidence in telehealth and its sustained use in the future depends on supportive regulatory policies and availability and use of measures to monitor quality and effectiveness.","Srinivasan, Roopa; Wallis, Kate E; Soares, Neelkamal",Journal of developmental and behavioral pediatrics : JDBP,https://doi.org/10.1097/dbp.0000000000000963; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33990511/,597

The aim of this study was to investigate the early surgical outcomes of thymectomy using the SPT and TRT subxiphoid approaches and to discuss their appropriate uses. METHODS The subjects included 80 patients who underwent thymectomy via a subxiphoid approach. These patients were selected from among 99 surgical cases of myasthenia gravis or anterior mediastinal tumors at Fujita Health University Hospital between March 2011 and November 2015. The patients were divided into a SPT group (n=72) and a TRT group (n=8). RESULTS The operative time was shorter in the SPT group compared with that in the TRT group (135±48 and 20±40 min, respectively; P=0.0004). There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of blood loss volume (5.9±16.8 and 5.4±4.6 mL, respectively; P=0.48), postoperative hospital stay duration (4.0±2.0 and 4.3±3.6 days, respectively; P=0.21), or the period of postoperative oral analgesic use (10.7±5.4 and 10.1±3.4 days, respectively; P=0.89). There were no intraoperative complications, such as intraoperative bleeding, in either group. In the SPT group, there was one case (1.4%) of postoperative left phrenic nerve paralysis and one case (1.4%) of transient paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. No one died during or after the surgery. CONCLUSIONS TRT may be as equally minimally invasive as SPT. In cases where the thymoma has infiltrated the surrounding organs, the extent of the infiltration should be used to determine whether to select TRT, or median sternotomy.","Suda, Takashi; Kaneda, Shinji; Hachimaru, Ayumi; Tochii, Daisuke; Maeda, Ryo; Tochii, Sachiko; Takagi, Yasushi",Journal of thoracic disease,https://doi.org/10.3978/j.issn.2072-1439.2016.02.34; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27014473/,597

The interplay between socioeconomic, behavioral, and environmental factors generates uncertainty about the current status and future trend of age at menarche in most societies. Therefore, we aimed to describe trends in age at menarche during the 20th century in Portugal. METHODS A sample of 11 274 women born between 1920 and 1992 in northern Portugal, recruited to participate in three population-based cohorts (EPIPorto, EPITeen, and Generation XXI) was evaluated. Age at menarche across birth year categories was compared using ANOVA and the rate of change over time using linear regression. RESULTS Age at menarche decreased with birth year (-31.1 days per 5 years; β = -.017, P < .001), women born before 1930 having a significantly higher age at menarche than those who were born after 1990 (mean (SD) = 13.1 (1.83) vs 12.0 (1.25), P < .001). CONCLUSIONS The decrease in age at menarche in northern Portugal suggests that a plateau is yet to be reached. Attention to time trends in age at menarche is relevant for health promotion since there is a possible relationship between pubertal timing and the later development of the metabolic syndrome.","Queiroga, Ana C; Silva, Rita S; Santos, Ana C; Maia, Isabel; Barros, Henrique",American journal of human biology : the official journal of the Human Biology Council,https://doi.org/10.1002/ajhb.23392; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31981251/,597

The treatment of these aneurysms may be challenging due to the risk of occlusion of such a small and eloquent artery as the AChoA. We aimed to evaluate the risk factors for complications in AChoA aneurysm treatment. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed 47 consecutive AChoA aneurysms in 40 patients treated in our institution from 1999 and 2014 by endovascular means (87%) or surgical clipping (13%). Minor (transient or minor neurological deficits) and major complications (severe permanent neurological deficits or death) were systematically recorded. The influence of patient age, sex, aneurysm size, neck size, shape, dome-to-neck ratio and treatment technique on the occurrence of procedure-related complications was evaluated. RESULTS Of the patients 11 experienced procedure-related complications (5 major, 6 minor). Aneurysms with multilobed shape were significantly associated with a higher procedure-related complication rate. There was a tendency for higher major procedure-related complication rate in small volume aneurysms. We did not find any association between the other factors analyzed and occurrence of procedure-related complications. CONCLUSION Treatment of AChoA aneurysms has an acceptable complication risk.

107939,"School closure, COVID-19 and influenza A.",2020-07-28,"OBJECTIVES In response to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, traditional, in-person neuropsychological assessment services paused in most settings. Neuropsychologists have sought to establish new guidelines and care models using telehealth neuropsychology (teleNP) services. The need to adapt to remote technology became the most difficult challenge to date for existing practice models. Results: Primary considerations for transitioning to teleNP include scope and limitations of the telehealth modality, informed consent for telehealth services, patient privacy and confidentiality, test security, and validity of telehealth assessments. Given timelines for fully re-opening clinical settings, access to traditional models of neuropsychological care remains unclear. These considerations will remain relevant even upon return to an in-office practice, as many assessment models will likely continue with teleNP to some extent. Specialists will need to consider the unique needs of their populations in ensuring quality care, as diagnostic differences and patient age will impact participation in teleNP. Conclusions: As the COVID-19 pandemic lingers, teleNP presents an opportunity as well as a challenge for neuropsychologists looking to provide patient care in the context of social distancing and stay-at-home restrictions. In this transformative time, the field of neuropsychology has opportunities to advance beyond traditional settings and focus on alternative delivery of patient care.","Hewitt, Kelsey C; Rodgin, Sandra; Loring, David W; Pritchard, Alison E; Jacobson, Lisa A",The Clinical neuropsychologist,https://doi.org/10.1080/13854046.2020.1811891; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32842849/,597

All patients at a treating institution participated in the same intervention (EO or LEAP) to minimize contamination bias. Participants completed surveys, arm volume measurements, and self-reported ROM assessments before surgery and at 12 and 18 months after surgery. Lymphedema was defined as a ≥10% difference in limb volume at any time post-surgery up to 18 months after surgery or diagnosis by a health provider. Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests were used to compare lymphedema-free rates between groups, stratified by lymph node surgery type. Self-reported ROM differences were compared between groups. RESULTS A total of 554 participants (56% LEAP) were included in the analyses. At 18 months, lymphedema-free rates were 58% (EO) versus 55% (LEAP) (P = .37). ROM for both arms was greater in LEAP versus EO at 12 months; by 18 months, most women reported full ROM, regardless of group. In LEAP, only one-third wore a sleeve ≥75% of the time; 50% performed lymphedema exercises at least weekly. CONCLUSION Lymphedema incidence did not differ by intervention group at 18 months. Poor adherence in the LEAP group may have contributed. However, physical therapy may speed recovery of ROM. Further research is needed to effectively reduce the incidence and severity of lymphedema in patients who have breast cancer.","Paskett, Electra D; Le-Rademacher, Jennifer; Oliveri, Jill M; Liu, Heshan; Seisler, Drew K; Sloan, Jeffrey A; Armer, Jane M; Naughton, Michelle J; Hock, Karen; Schwartz, Michael; Unzeitig, Gary; Melnik, Marianne; Yee, Lisa D; Fleming, Gini F; Taylor, John R; Loprinzi, Charles",Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.33183; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33079411/,597

METHODS The selected countries were categorized into ""earlier"" adopters (group A: England, Germany, France, and Sweden) and more ""recent"" adopters (group B: Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania). A systematic review of published literature was performed. The analysis and comparison of HTA procedures were done by using an analytical framework. RESULTS In all countries, the assessment criteria used include effectiveness, safety, relative effectiveness, and economic data. In group A countries, the main objectives are improving quality of care, ensuring equal access, and efficient use of resources. Group B countries have established HTA organizations with official guidelines but often seek the decisions of other developed countries. They place considerable emphasis on the budget impact of new therapies, and HTA is also used as a cost estimation tool for state budgets. CONCLUSIONS HTA organizations have been developed dynamically not only in high-income countries but also in countries with limited resources. The experience and evolution of both can be used by countries that are in the dawn of creating an HTA organization.","Beletsi, Alexandra; Koutrafouri, Vassiliki; Karampli, Eleftheria; Pavi, Elpida",Value in health regional issues,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vhri.2018.08.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30316029/,597

This review summarises the data and outlines the potential challenges in the field of long-acting antiretroviral therapy (ART). RECENT FINDINGS In recent years, monthly and two monthly long-acting injectable ART in the form of cabotegravir and rilpivirine has shown safety and efficacy in large-scale phase 3 randomised control trials. Also, agents with novel mechanisms of action, such as Lenacapavir, have been tested in early-phase studies and are currently being tested in phase 2-3 clinical trials; if successful, this may allow six-monthly dosing schedules. SUMMARY However, despite evidence that suggests that these therapies are efficacious and acceptable to patients, the challenge of integrating these agents into our current healthcare infrastructure and making these novel agents cost-effective and available to the populations most likely to benefit remains. The next frontier for long-acting therapy will be to introduce these agents in a real-world setting ensuring that the groups most in need of long-acting therapy are not left behind.","Thornhill, John; Orkin, Chloe",Current opinion in HIV and AIDS,https://doi.org/10.1097/coh.0000000000000670; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33625040/,597

With access to these data, the authors extend that work and support a definite construct for auditory processing disorder (APD). The goal here is to examine MAPA-2 reliability and validity (construct, content, and concurrent). Evidence for the APD construct is further buttressed by measures of sensitivity and specificity. Results of MAPA-2 testing on children diagnosed with learning disability (LD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and specific language impairment (SLI) are included. Method Normative data (previously published as the MAPA-2) allowing derivation of these findings included a representative sample of 748 children (53% girls) ages 7-14 years tested by 54 speech-language pathologists and audiologists in 27 U.S. states. The authors examined diagnostic accuracy based on the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (2005) criteria (index test) for confirmed cases of APD. The index was also used to identify listening problems for three other diagnostic categories (LD, ADHD, and SLI). Validated questionnaire responses from parents and school personnel allowed incorporation of functional measures widely supported in APD diagnosis but unavailable with other normative and sensitivity/specificity studies. Results Reliability and validity were both satisfactory, and diagnostic accuracy for an APD group of 18 (28% female) compared to the remaining typical group of 625 yielded 89% sensitivity and 82% specificity. The remaining three groups (LD, ADHD, and SLI), where comorbidity was expected to be about 50%, had APD-type listening problems with a prevalence ranging from 52% to 65%. Conclusions Current results provide important evidence for the construct of APD. The MAPA-2 can be administered by an audiologist or speech-language pathologist. A similar diagnostic protocol in Australia yielded positive therapeutic gains. Further study is encouraged to determine if the present positive findings will be found in future research.","Schow, Ronald L; Whitaker, Mary M; Seikel, J Anthony; Brockett, Jeff E; Domitz Vieira, Deborah M","Language, speech, and hearing services in schools",https://doi.org/10.1044/2020_lshss-20-00001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32831000/,597
109039,The Importance of Rubber Dam Isolation in Endodontics Throughout COVID-19 Outbreak.,2020,"There is evidence of aberrations in the vitamin D-endocrine system in subjects with respiratory diseases. Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in patients with respiratory diseases, and patients who receive vitamin D have significantly larger improvements in inspiratory muscle strength and maximal oxygen uptake. Studies have provided an opportunity to determine which proteins link vitamin D to respiratory pathology, including the major histocompatibility complex class II molecules, vitamin D receptor, vitamin D-binding protein, chromosome P450, Toll-like receptors, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1, and the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate. Vitamin D also exerts its effect on respiratory diseases through cell signaling mechanisms, including matrix metalloproteinases, mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, prostaglandins, reactive oxygen species, and nitric oxide synthase. In conclusion, vitamin D plays a significant role in respiratory diseases. The best form of vitamin D for use in the treatment of respiratory diseases is calcitriol because it is the active metabolite of vitamin D3 and modulates inflammatory cytokine expression. Further investigation of calcitriol in respiratory diseases is needed.","Luong, Khanh Vinh Quoc; Nguyen, Lan Thi Hoàng",Therapeutic advances in respiratory disease,https://doi.org/10.1177/1753465813503029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24056290/,597

Prior work has emphasized the importance of replication in ensuring reliable modeling, and has yielded important replication strategies. However, this work is based on relatively simple theory generating models, and its lessons might not translate to high-fidelity models used for decision support. Using NetLogo we replicate a recently published high-fidelity model examining the effects of a HIV biomedical intervention. We use a modular approach to build our model from the ground up, and provide examples of the replication process investigating the replication of two sub-modules as well as the overall simulation experiment. For the first module, we achieved numerical identity during replication, whereas we obtained distributional equivalence in replicating the second module. We achieved relational equivalence among the overall model behaviors, with a 0.98 correlation across the two implementations for our outcome measure even without strictly following the original model in the formation of the sexual network. Our results show that replication of high-fidelity models is feasible when following a set of systematic strategies that leverage the modularity, and highlight the role of replication standards, modular testing, and functional code in facilitating such strategies.","Vermeer, Wouter; Hjorth, Arthur; Jenness, Samuel M; Brown, Hendrick; Wilensky, Uri",Journal of artificial societies and social simulation : JASSS,https://doi.org/10.18564/jasss.4352; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33204215/,597
111826,CE: Providing Care for Caregivers During COVID-19.,2021-05-01,"BACKGROUND Increased urbanization in the developing world parallels a rising burden of chronic diseases. Developing countries account for ∼ 80% of global cardiovascular (CV) deaths, but contribute a paucity of systematic epidemiological data on CV risk factors. OBJECTIVE To estimate the prevalence of CV risk factors in rural and urban cohorts attending general practice clinics in the Africa and Middle East (AfME) region. METHODS In a cross-sectional epidemiological study, the presence of CV risk factors (hypertension, diabetes mellitus (diabetes), dyslipidemia, obesity, smoking and abdominal obesity) were evaluated in stable adult outpatients attending general practice primary care clinics. A rural population was defined as isolated (>50 km or lack of easy access to commuter transportation) from urban centers. RESULTS 4,378 outpatients were systematically recruited from 94 clinics across 14 AfME countries. Mean age was 46 ± 14 years and 52% of outpatients were female. A high prevalence of dyslipidemia (70%) and abdominal obesity (68%) were observed, followed by hypertension (43%) and diabetes (25%). The vast majority of outpatients (92%) had at least one modifiable CV risk factor, many (74%) had more than one, and half (53%) had 3 or more. These findings were observed in both genders and across urban and rural centers. Among outpatients with pre-existing hypertension or dyslipidemia, many were not at their target blood pressure or LDL-cholesterol goals. CONCLUSION Cardiovascular risk factors are highly prevalent among relatively young, stable outpatients attending general practice clinics across AfME. The findings support opportunistic screening for CV risk factors whenever outpatients visit a general practitioner and provide an opportunity for early identification and management of CV risk factors, including lifestyle interventions.","Alsheikh-Ali, Alawi A; Omar, Mohamed I; Raal, Frederick J; Rashed, Wafa; Hamoui, Omar; Kane, Abdoul; Alami, Mohamed; Abreu, Paula; Mashhoud, Walid M",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0102830; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25090638/,597

Methods Following the PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched PubMed®, Scopus, EMBASE®, Cochrane Library and Web of Science for studies published before May 2019. Inclusion criteria were: (i) an original cost-effectiveness analysis of emergency care intervention or intervention package, and (ii) the analysis occurred in a low- and middle-income setting. To identify additional primary studies, we hand searched the reference lists of included studies. We used the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards guideline to appraise the quality of included studies. Results Of the 1674 articles we identified, 35 articles met the inclusion criteria. We identified an additional four studies from the reference lists. We excluded many studies for being deemed costing assessments without an effectiveness analysis. Most included studies were single-intervention analyses. Emergency care interventions evaluated by included studies covered prehospital services, provider training, treatment interventions, emergency diagnostic tools and facilities and packages of care. The reporting quality of the studies varied. Conclusion We found large gaps in the evidence surrounding the cost-effectiveness of emergency care interventions in low- and middle-income settings. Given the breadth of interventions currently in practice, many interventions remain unassessed, suggesting the need for future research to aid resource allocation decisions. In particular, packages of multiple interventions and system-level changes represent a priority area for future research.","Werner, Kalin; Risko, Nicholas; Burkholder, Taylor; Munge, Kenneth; Wallis, Lee; Reynolds, Teri",Bulletin of the World Health Organization,https://doi.org/10.2471/blt.19.241158; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32514199/,597

There is conflicting evidence on the effects of SG on gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to assess whether taking an aggressive approach to managing hiatal weakness in patients undergoing SG results in an alteration in GERD symptoms. SETTING Tertiary public hospital and private hospital, Sydney, Australia. METHODS Patients undergoing laparoscopic extended (beginning within 2 cm from pylorus) SG were included. If evidence of weakness was present, an anterior hiatal dissection and tight suture repair was performed. If a hiatus hernia was present, formal repair was undertaken. Patients were questioned and scored on preoperative and postoperative reflux symptom frequency and severity, proton pump inhibitor (PPI) usage, current weight, and satisfaction. RESULTS A continuous cohort of 262 patients experienced a significant reduction in heartburn frequency (P = .035) and severity (P = .017). Moderate/severe preoperative reflux (Visick score 3 and 4) often improved whether there was a defect requiring repair or not (no repair P = .02, hiatal suture P = .001, hiatus hernia repair P<.001). The severity of symptoms also improved (no repair P = 0.005, hiatal suture P<.001, hiatus hernia repair P< .001). CONCLUSION Moderate or severe preexisting gastroesophageal reflux improved for most of our obese patients undergoing an extended SG when hiatal defects were routinely repaired. Moderate to severe preoperative reflux also improved in the average obese patient when there was no hiatal defect to repair.","Lyon, A; Gibson, S C; De-loyde, K; Martin, D",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soard.2014.08.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25863531/,597

The purpose of this study was to investigate the characteristics of participants and analyze the major factors of HIV infection in VCT in Nantong, China. This study was conducted between January 2010 and December 2015, based on the responses to questionnaires and blood test results retrieved from the Chinese National HIV/AIDS Comprehensive Control Information System (CNHCCIS). Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors related to HIV infection. Differences between first-time testers and repeat testers were assessed using the chi-squared or Fisher test. Over six years, a total of 11,560 VCT participants were included, and 420 cases were confirmed to be HIV-positive. Overall, the annual number of participants was relatively stable with a mean of 1927, while there was a rapid increase in the HIV detection rate (from 1.03% in 2010 to 7.52% in 2015). In multivariate analysis, referral counseling and having a HIV-positive spouse/fixed sex partners were found to be significantly associated with HIV infection among all participants, while being unmarried or divorced, having commercial heterosexual behaviors, and male-male sexual behaviors are additional HIV-related factors for males. Compared to first-time testers, repeat testers were more willing to engage in high-risk sexual behaviors and had higher HIV detection rates (P < 0.001). In conclusion, the HIV epidemic in Nantong is still not controlled. Therefore, in the future, it is critical to expand VCT services to increase the detection rate of HIV, which can prevent the transmission of HIV effectively.","Xu, Zhengcheng; Ma, Ping; Chu, Minjie; Chen, Yujia; Miao, Junyan; Xia, Hongli; Zhuang, Xun",BioMed research international,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/5740654; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33083474/,597

Coiling remains a first-line treatment for small, morphologically simple aneurysms. OBJECTIVE To compare coiling and flow diversion in small, uncomplicated intracranial aneurysms (typically amenable to coiling). METHODS Forty patients treated with the pipeline embolization device (PED) for small (<10 mm), morphologically simple aneurysms that would have also been amenable to coiling were identified. These patients were matched in a 1:1 fashion with 40 patients with comparable aneurysms treated with coiling. Matching was based on age, gender, aneurysm size, and aneurysm morphology. RESULTS The 2 groups were comparable with regard to baseline characteristics including age, gender, and aneurysm size. The complication rate did not differ between the 2 groups (2.5% with coiling vs 5% with PED; P = .6). Multivariate analysis did not identify any predictor of complications. Complete occlusion (100%) at follow-up was significantly higher in patients treated with PED (70%) than coiling (47.5%, P = .04). In multivariate analysis, treatment with PED predicted aneurysm obliteration ( P = .04). A significantly higher proportion of coiled patients (32.5%) required retreatment compared with flow diversion (5%, P = .003). In multivariate analysis, coiling predicted retreatment ( P = .006). All patients achieved a favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale: 0-2) regardless of group. CONCLUSION This matched analysis suggests that flow diversion provides higher occlusion rates, lower retreatment rates, and no additional morbidity compared with coiling in small, simple aneurysms amenable to both techniques. These results suggest a potential benefit for flow diversion over coiling even in small, uncomplicated aneurysms.","Chalouhi, Nohra; Daou, Badih; Barros, Guilherme; Starke, Robert M; Chitale, Ameet; Ghobrial, George; Dalyai, Richard; Hasan, David; Gonzalez, L Fernando; Tjoumakaris, Stavropoula; Rosenwasser, Robert H; Jabbour, Pascal",Neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1093/neuros/nyw070; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28402491/,597

METHODS From June, 2003 to October, 2009, 56 patients with gastric GIST who underwent laparoscopic gastric resection were retrospectively reviewed, and their surgical procedure, perioperative outcomes, pathology, and follow-up outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS All patients underwent laparoscopic gastric resection successfully, including 33 laparoscopic wedge resections, 19 laparoscopic transgastric tumor-everting resections, 3 laparoscopic-assisted distal gastrectomies, and 1 laparoscopic-assisted endoscopic resection. The operative approaches performed were mostly based on the tumor location. No conversions were observed. The mean operative duration was 90 minutes (30 to 210 min), blood loss was 55 mL (5 to 180 mL), time for passage of flatus was 2 days (1 to 11 d), and the postoperative hospital stay was 7 days (3 to 13 d). The resection margin was microscopic negative. After 21.5 months (6 to 76 mo) of follow-up, there was no operative recurrence and metastasis. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic gastric resection for selective cases of gastric GISTs is safe, feasible, and effective.

METHODS AND MATERIALS The TR-MRF technique consists of repeated MRF acquisitions using an unbalanced steady-state free precession sequence with spiral-in-spiral-out trajectory. TR-MRF was first tested via computer simulation using a 4D extended cardiac-torso (XCAT) phantom for both regular and irregular breathing profiles, and was tested in three healthy volunteers. Parametric MRF maps at different respiratory phases were subsequently estimated using our TR-MRF sorting and reconstruction techniques. The resulting TR-MRF maps were evaluated using a set of metrices related to radiotherapy applications, including absolute difference in motion amplitude, error in the amplitude of diaphragm motion (ADM), tumor volume error (TVE), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and tumor contrast. RESULTS TR-MRF maps with regular and irregular breathing were successfully generated in XCAT phantom. Numerical simulations showed that the TVE were 1.6±2.7% and 1.3±2.2%, the average absolute differences in tumor motion amplitude were 0.3±0.7 mm and 0.3±0.6 mm ,and the ADM were 4.1±0.9% and 3.5±0.9% for irregular and regular breathing respectively. The SNR of the T1 and T2 maps of the liver and the tumor were generally higher for regular breathing compared to irregular breathing, whereas tumor-to-liver contrast is similar between the two breathing patterns. The proposed technique was successfully implemented on the healthy volunteers. CONCLUSION We have successfully demonstrated in both digital phantom and health subjects a novel TR-MRF technique capable of imaging respiratory motions with simultaneous quantification of MR multi-parametric maps.","Li, Tian; Cui, Di; Hui, Edward S; Cai, Jing",Medical physics,https://doi.org/10.1002/mp.14513; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33006775/,597
116966,Exploring smoking cessation behaviors of outpatients in outpatient clinics: Application of the transtheoretical model.,2020-07-02,"This study aimed to understand the changes and correlation in the long-term trends of polypharmacy and the utilization of health care services in a population over the age of 50 years through the use of a national database. A total of 2813 subjects who participated in surveys in 1999, 2003, and 2007 were selected as the samples. Each subject was followed-up for the period of 9 years. From 1999 to 2007, the proportion of mild and severe polypharmacy cases increased from 41.5% (1999) to 51.3% (2003) and 57.1% (2007), respectively. This study found that the more severe the polypharmacy was, the higher the risk of health care service utilization would be. The Generalized Estimating Equation model of multivariate analysis showed that the incidence rate ratio of medical utilization increased with the severity of polypharmacy, as did the use of advanced medical resources (ie, the number of hospitalizations). In particular, the increase in incidence rate ratio was more significant in 3 aspects: (1) number of pharmacy visits; (2) number of emergency room admissions; and (3) number of hospitalizations. The government should establish policies and guidance for the safe use of medicines to ensure reduced risk for older people.","Li, Ji-Wen; Hsieh, Hui-Min; Weng, Shih-Feng; Lee, I-Chen",Asia-Pacific journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.1177/1010539519828077; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30803259/,597
117232,Medical leadership in the NHS during the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020-06-02,"AIMS Arterial stiffness is an underlying risk factor and a hallmark of cardiovascular diseases. The endothelial cell (EC) glycocalyx is a glycan rich surface layer that plays a key role in protecting against EC dysfunction and vascular disease. However, the mechanisms by which arterial stiffness promotes endothelial cell dysfunction and vascular disease are not fully understood, and whether the mechanism involves the protective endothelial glycocalyx is yet to be determined. We hypothesized that endothelial glycocalyx protects the endothelial cells lining the vascular wall from dysfunction and disease in response to arterial stiffness. METHODS AND RESULTS Cells cultured on polyacrylamide (PA) gels of substrate stiffness 10 kPa (mimicking the subendothelial stiffness of aged, unhealthy arteries) showed a significant inhibition of glycocalyx expression compared to cells cultured on softer PA gels (2.5 kPa, mimicking the subendothelial stiffness of young, healthy arteries). Specifically, gene and protein analyses revealed that a glycocalyx core protein Glypican 1 was inhibited in cells cultured on stiff PA gels. These cells had enhanced endothelial cell dysfunction as determined by enhanced cell inflammation (enhanced inflammatory gene expression, monocyte adhesion and inhibited nitric oxide expression), proliferation and EndMT. Removal of Glypican 1 using gene-specific silencing with siRNA or gene overexpression using a plasmid revealed that Glypican 1 is required to protect against stiffness-mediated endothelial cell dysfunction. Consistent with this, using a model of age-mediated stiffness, older mice exhibited a reduced expression of Glypican 1 and enhanced endothelial cell dysfunction compared to young mice. Glypican1 gene deletion in knockout mice (GPC1 -/-) exacerbated endothelial dysfunction in young mice, which normally had high endothelial expression, but not in old mice that normally expressed low levels.Endothelial cell dysfunction was exacerbated in young, but not aged, Glypican 1 knockout mice (GPC1 -/-). CONCLUSIONS Arterial stiffness promotes EC dysfunction and vascular disease at least partly through the suppression of the glycocalyx protein Glypican 1. Glypican 1 contributes to the protection against endothelial cell dysfunction and vascular disease in endothelial cells. TRANSLATIONAL PERSPECTIVE This work reveals for the first time the effect of arterial stiffness on the glycocalyx protein Glypican 1 in endothelial cell function. Stiffness promotes endothelial cell dysfunction and subsequently vascular disease at least partly through the suppression of Glypican 1. Thus, Glypican 1 could be a novel therapeutic candidate for the treatment/reversal of arterial stiffness-mediated vascular disease.","Mahmoud, Marwa; Mayer, Mariya; Cancel, Limary M; Bartosch, Anne Marie; Mathews, Rick; Tarbell, John M",Cardiovascular research,https://doi.org/10.1093/cvr/cvaa201; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32647868/,597

The purpose of this systematic review was to identify and critically appraise LC assessment tools and their measurement properties, in order to make recommendations for their implementation in surgical training. METHODS A systematic search (1989-2013) was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane, and grey literature sources. Evidence for validity (content, response process, internal structure, relations to other variables, and consequences) and the conditions in which the evidence was obtained were evaluated. RESULTS A total of 54 articles were included for qualitative synthesis. Fifteen technical skills and two non-technical skills assessment tools were identified. The 17 tools were used for either: recorded procedures (nine tools, 60%), direct observation (five tools, 30%), or both (three tools, 18%). Fourteen (82%) tools reported inter-rater reliability and one reported a Generalizability Theory coefficient. Nine (53%) had evidence for validity based on clinical experience and 11 (65%) compared scores to other assessments. Consequences of scores, educational impact, applications to residency training, and how raters were trained were not clearly reported. No studies mentioned cost. CONCLUSIONS The most commonly reported validity evidence was inter-rater reliability and relationships to other known variables. Consequences of assessments and rater training were not clearly reported. These data and the evidence for validity should be taken into consideration when deciding how to select and implement a tool to assess performance of LC, and especially how to interpret the results.","Watanabe, Yusuke; Bilgic, Elif; Lebedeva, Ekaterina; McKendy, Katherine M; Feldman, Liane S; Fried, Gerald M; Vassiliou, Melina C",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-015-4285-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26092014/,597

The aim of our study was to characterize the clinical, laboratory, allergological, and genetic features of HCQ-induced AGEP. METHODS We conducted a retrospective study of patients with HCQ-induced AGEP diagnosed between 2011 and 2019. We performed molecular analysis to identify variations in the IL36RN gene. We also reviewed similar cases reported between 1991 and March 2020. RESULTS Seven female patients were included. The mean age was 47 years old, and the average time from HCQ start to onset of symptoms was 40 days. All patients received topical steroids with a full resolution of the rash within an average of 39 days after HCQ withdrawal. Patch tests were performed for three patients with positive results in one case. Genetic analyses were performed for three patients, and no mutation in the IL36RN gene was identified. CONCLUSION The latent period and the duration for resolution of HCQ-induced AGEP may be longer than with other drugs due to the metabolic characteristics of HCQ.

However, whether bridging therapy (pretreatment with intravenous thrombolysis before MT) provides additional benefits in patients with middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the effects of direct MT and bridging therapy, and to elucidate the correlation between thrombus composition and stroke subtypes. Seventy-three patients with acute ischemic stroke who received MT, were eligible for intravenous thrombolysis, and had MCA occlusion were included. We matched 21 direct MT patients with 21 bridging therapy patients using propensity score matching and compared their 3rd-month clinical outcomes. All MCA thrombi (n = 45) were histologically analyzed, and the red blood cell (RBC) and fibrin percentages were quantified. We compared the clot composition according to stroke etiology (large-artery atherosclerosis and cardioembolism) and intravenous thrombolysis application. The baseline characteristics showed no difference between groups except for a higher atrial fibrillation rate and NIHSS score on admission in the direct MT group. We performed a supportive analysis using propensity score matching but could not find any differences in the functional outcome, mortality, and intracerebral hemorrhage. In the histological clot analysis, the cardioembolic clots without intravenous thrombolysis pretreatment had higher RBC (P = 0.042) and lower fibrin (P = 0.042) percentages than the large-artery atherosclerosis thrombi. Similar findings were observed in the thrombi treated with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (P = 0.012). In conclusion, there was no difference in the functional outcomes between the direct MT and bridging therapy groups. However, randomized trials are needed to elucidate the high ratio of cardioembolism subtype in our group of patients. The histological MCA thrombus composition differed between cardioembolism and large-artery atherosclerosis, and this finding provides valuable information on the underlying pathogenesis and thrombus origin.","Gong, Li; Zheng, Xiaoran; Feng, Lijin; Zhang, Xiang; Dong, Qiong; Zhou, Xiaoyu; Wang, Haichao; Zhang, Xiaojun; Shu, Zhongwen; Zhao, Yanxin; Liu, Xueyuan",Cell transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1177/0963689718823206; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30654640/,597

There are risks and benefits associated with both the type of interventions. Hence, this review was conducted to compare outcomes of immediate and delayed induction of labour among women with hypertensive disorder of pregnancy based on disease severity and gestational age. METHODS We conducted systematic searches in various databases including Medline, Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials (CENTRAL), Scopus, and Embase from inception until October 2019.Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess the quality of published trials. A meta-analysis was performed with random-effects model and reported pooled Risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS Fourteen randomized controlled trials with 4244 participants were included. Majority of the studies had low or unclear bias risks. Amongst late onset mild pre-eclampsia patients, the risk of renal failure was significantly lower with immediate induction of labour (pooled RR: 0.36; 95%CI: 0.14 to 0.92). In severe pre-eclampsia patients, immediate induction of labour significantly reduced the risk of having small-for-gestational age babies compared to delayed induction of labour (pooled RR: 0.49; 95%CI: 0.29-0.84).Delayed induction was found to significantly reduce the risk of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome risk among late onset mild pre-eclampsia patients (pooled RR: 2.15; 95%CI: 1.14 to 4.06) None of the other outcomes demonstrated statistically significant difference between the two interventions. CONCLUSION Delayed induction of labour with expectant monitoring may not be inferior to immediate induction of labour in terms of neonatal and maternal outcomes. Expectant approach of management for late onset mild pre-eclampsia patients may be associated with decreased risk of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, while immediate induction of labour among severe pre-eclampsia patients is associated with reduced risk of small-for-gestational age babies and among mild pre-eclampsia patients, it is associated with reduced risk of severe renal impairment.","Li, Jia; Shao, Xuecheng; Song, Shurong; Liang, Qian; Liu, Yang; Qi, Xiaojin",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-020-03407-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33243171/,597

119687,"Intercepting the deadly trinity of mucormycosis, diabetes and COVID-19 in India.",2021-06-08,"BACKGROUND The medial collateral ligament (MCL) is one of the primary elbows stabilizers. It is composed of an anterior bundle (AB), a posterior bundle (PB) and a transverse bundle. In elbow dislocations, until today MCL reconstruction has addressed the AB only. The purpose of this paper is to understand the biomechanical role of the PB of the MCL and to propose a new surgical technique for the simultaneous reconstruction of the anterior and posterior bundles, preventing the risk of recurrent posterior dislocation or posteromedial rotational instability (PMRI). MATERIALS AND METHODS Sixteen cadaveric elbows were subjected to a force in compression, supination valgus and pronation varus. The residual stability was evaluated in three conditions: intact MCL, sectioned AB and sectioned AB + PB. The tests were performed in collaboration with the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering of the Politecnico di Torino. In six elbows, the MCL was then reconstructed with the new technique. RESULTS Complete posterior elbow dislocation does not occur until the PB is sectioned. The section of the AB alone causes elbow instability in valgus stress, but not a dislocation. The reconstruction of the AB and the PB using the described technique allows a good recovery of range of motion and joint stability. CONCLUSIONS The PB of the MCL has a primary role in elbow stability against valgus stress, and it prevents elbow posterior dislocation at all flexion angles. The described reconstruction technique should reduce the risk of residual PMRI.","Sard, A; Dutto, E; Rotini, R; Vanni, S; Pastorelli, S; Battiston, B",Musculoskeletal surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12306-017-0495-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28770510/,597

It was hypothesized that host characteristics and surgical site assessments predict the degree of graft remodeling for ADMs used during breast reconstruction. METHODS The ADMs were biopsied from the breast reconstruction sites of n = 62 patients during a subsequent breast procedure, stained with hematoxylin-eosin, and evaluated according to a semi-quantitative scoring system for remodeling characteristics (cell types, cell infiltration, extracellular matrix deposition, scaffold degradation, fibrous encapsulation, and neovascularization) and a mean composite score. Biopsies were stained with Sirius Red and Fast Green, and analyzed to determine the collagen I:III ratio. Based on univariate analyses between subject clinical characteristics and the histologic remodeling scores, cohort variables were selected for multivariable regression models using a P value of 0.20 or less. RESULTS The composite score model yielded 3 variables: pack-year history, corticosteroid use, and radiation timing (r pseudo = 0.81). The model for collagen I yielded 2 variables: corticosteroid use and reason for reoperation (r pseudo = 0.78). The model for collagen III yielded 1 variable: reason for reoperation (r pseudo = 0.35). CONCLUSIONS These preliminary results constitute the first steps in generating a risk prediction model that predicts the patients and clinical circumstances most likely to experience nonconstructive remodeling of biologic grafts used to reconstruct the breast.","Cavallo, Jaime A; Gangopadhyay, Noopur; Dudas, Jason; Roma, Andres A; Jasielec, Mateusz S; Baty, Jack; Baalman, Sara; Frisella, Margaret M; Tenenbaum, Marissa M; Myckatyn, Terence M; Matthews, Brent D; Deeken, Corey R",Annals of plastic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sap.0000000000000538; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25910026/,597

A recent review argued that vitamin D deficiency could have increased the COVID-19 outbreak and suggested vitamin D supplementation as a preventive action. In fact, many factors seem to be correlated both to low vitamin D levels and the importance of COVID-19 spreading and severity. It is also important to highlight that the lockdown, implemented in many countries, prevents people to go out and then increases the risk of vitamin D deficiency. COPD patients are particularly at risk to have low levels of vitamin D due to multiple risk factors. COPD may generate a systemic inflammatory process responsible of secondary extra-pulmonary impairments. Vitamin D deficiency could sustain and aggravate the systemic inflammation associated to COPD. Reports have also shown that vitamin D deficiency was associated to exacerbations and hospital admissions, as well as lung function. Recent research showed that vitamin D supplementation significantly reduced COPD exacerbations. Although vitamin D deficiency was not proved to be neither a risk factor of COVID-19, nor a determinant of its severity, vitamin D supplementation represents a preventive perspective that needs to be further studied.","Chaabouni, Malek; Feki, Walid; Chaabouni, Khansa; Kammoun, Samy",Advances in respiratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.5603/arm.a2020.0101; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32869273/,597
122151,Influenza in the COVID-19 Era.,2020-08-14,"Context Clinical autopsies have historically provided a fundamental contribution in the definition of the clinico-pathological basis of infectious diseases. Even though we are witnessing the decline of the clinical autopsy, its importance remains unchanged as it is the most exhaustive way to investigate diseases. The identification of the virus in postmortem tissues is a fundamental step in the definition of its clinical features. Objective To investigate the presence of Sars-CoV-2 in the postmortem with swabs. Design We performed postmortem swabs in 12 autopsy cases of patients with a clinical diagnosis of Sars-CoV-2 related pneumonia. Our protocol, consisted of a rhino-pharingeal and a tracheal swab in order to search for the virus in the upper airways and of two swabs on the parenchyma of each lung. We also performed a fifth swab on the parenchyma of both lungs in order to search for other viruses that could evolve in a clinical picture of interstitial pneumonia Results Overall we found that 9 out of 12 cases had at least one postmortem swab to be positive for Sars-CoV-2. Moreover we evaluated the time lapse between the antemortem and the postmortem swabs, the time between death and the postmortem swabs, and the time lapse between the postmortem swabs and the acceptance to the microbiology laboratory. Interestingly we did not find a relation neither between the results of the swabs and the time lapsed from their collection, or with the time lapsed before their acceptance in the microbiology laboratory. Conclusions A thorough knowledge of the eventual persistence of pathogens in deaths related to infectious diseases is fundamental for the safety of the operators during the autopsy practice, especially when referring to emergent pathogens like Sars-Cov-2. Our study highlights the importance in performing multiple swabs in the postmortem, since Sars-CoV-2 swab positivity can be limited to only a single swab.","Dell'Aquila, Marco; Cattani, Paola; Fantoni, Massimo; Marchetti, Simona; Aquila, Isabella; Stigliano, Egidio; Carbone, Arnaldo; Oliva, Antonio; Arena, Vincenzo",Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.5858/arpa.2020-0362-sa; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32589448/,597
123944,Overcoming the Impact of COVID-19 on Surgical Mentorship: A Scoping Review of Long-distance Mentorship in Surgery.,2021-05-11,"Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus well-known for the epidemic in the Americas in 2015-2016, where microcephaly in newborns and other neurological complications were connected to ZIKV infection. Many aspects of the viral life cycle, including binding and entry into the host cell, are still enigmatic. Based on the observation that CHO cells lack the expression of EGFR and are not permissive for various ZIKV strains, the relevance of EGFR for the viral life cycle was analyzed. Infection of A549 cells by ZIKV leads to a rapid internalization of EGFR that colocalizes with the endosomal marker EEA1. Moreover, the infection by different ZIKV strains is associated with an activation of EGFR and subsequent activation of the MAPK/ERK signaling cascade. However, treatment of the cells with MβCD, which on the one hand leads to an activation of EGFR but on the other hand prevents EGFR internalization, impairs ZIKV infection. Specific inhibition of EGFR or of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signal transduction cascade hinders ZIKV infection by inhibition of ZIKV entry. In accordance to this, knockout of EGFR expression impedes ZIKV entry. In case of an already established infection, inhibition of EGFR or of downstream signaling does not affect viral replication. Taken together, these data demonstrate the relevance of EGFR in the early stages of ZIKV infection and identify EGFR as a target for antiviral strategies. Importance These data deepen the knowledge about the ZIKV infection process and demonstrate the relevance of EGFR for ZIKV entry. In light of the fact that a variety of specific and efficient inhibitors of EGFR and of EGFR-dependent signaling were developed and licensed, repurposing of these substances could be a helpful tool to prevent the spreading of ZIKV infection in an epidemic outbreak.","Sabino, Catarina; Bender, Daniela; Herrlein, Marie-Luise; Hildt, Eberhard",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01195-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34379506/,597

124962,Assessment of electromyographic activity in patients with temporomandibular disorders and natural mediotrusive occlusal contact during chewing and tooth grinding.,2017,"OBJECTIVES Barrett's esophagus (BE) is the only identifiable premalignant condition for esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). Management of BE with low-grade dysplasia continues to be controversial. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing the risk of progression to high-grade dysplasia or EAC among patients with BE with low-grade dysplasia treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) compared with surveillance endoscopy. METHODS Our search included Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Central, was limited to English language articles, and was last searched on 31 December 2015. Studies were reviewed by title and abstract, and then full text by two independent reviewers. Two independent reviewers extracted data. Differences were resolved by consensus. The primary outcome of interest was the relative risk of disease progression among patients with BE with low-grade dysplasia treated with RFAcompared with surveillance. RESULTS Our search resulted in 2,029 citations, 19 studies were included in the final analysis, totaling 2,746 patients. Relative risk of disease progression in RFA compared with surveillance was 0.14% (95% confidence interval: 0.04-0.45), P=0.001. This measure was stable when only all studies were included. Absolute risk reduction was 10.9% and the number needed to treat was 9.2. Results were stable over several quality measures, overtime, and when excluding randomized trials. The cumulative rate of progression to high-grade dysplasia/EAC was lower in RFA compared with surveillance (1.7% vs. 12.6%, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Similarly, the incidence rate of progression among patients with surveillance was significantly higher from those treated with RFA (0.022 vs. 0.005, P<0.001). RFA results in a significant reduction risk of disease progression to high-grade dysplasia/EAC among patients with BE with low-grade dysplasia.","Qumseya, Bashar J; Wani, Sachin; Gendy, Sherif; Harnke, Ben; Bergman, Jacques J; Wolfsen, Herbert",The American journal of gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1038/ajg.2017.70; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28374819/,597

127387,COVID-19: Why Has the Mortality Rate Declined?,2020-08-28,"Responsible for generating the proteome that controls phenotype, translation is the ultimate convergence point for myriad upstream signals that influence gene expression. System-wide adaptive translational reprogramming has recently emerged as a pillar of cellular adaptation. As classic regulators of mRNA stability and translation efficiency, foundational studies established the concept of collaboration and competition between RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) on individual mRNAs. Fresh conceptual innovations now highlight stress-activated, evolutionarily conserved RBP networks and ncRNAs that increase the translation efficiency of populations of transcripts encoding proteins that participate in a common cellular process. The discovery of post-transcriptional functions for long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) was particularly intriguing given their cell-type-specificity and historical definition as nuclear-functioning epigenetic regulators. The convergence of RBPs, lncRNAs, and microRNAs on functionally related mRNAs to enable adaptive protein synthesis is a newer biological paradigm that highlights their role as ""translatome (protein output) remodelers"" and reinvigorates the paradigm of ""RNA operons."" Together, these concepts modernize our understanding of cellular stress adaptation and strategies for therapeutic development.

However, the efficacy and safety outcomes of this procedure remain under debate. Here, we compare our early outcome and mid-term safety of OAGB with primary Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). METHODS This was a retrospective study using computerized electronic medical records data of patients who underwent RYGB or OAGB as a primary procedure from February 2012 to February 2019 in our bariatric center. Data collected included demographics, weight-outcomes, adverse events, hospital readmission, reoperation rates, and mortality following both procedures. RESULTS A total of 314 patients were included (132 RYGB and 182 OAGB). Operative time and costs were significantly lower for OAGB (80 vs. 125 min, p<0.01 and 2018.8 vs. 2912.3 USD, p < 0.01, respectively), but length of hospital stay was longer (4.06 ± 0.67 days vs. 3.58 ± 0.79, p < 0.0001). At 12 months post-surgery, the percentage of excess body mass index loss was comparable between the two groups, but the change in body mass index (BMI) was significantly higher in the OAGB group. Early (< 30 days) and late (> 30 days) surgical adverse events were also similar between the two groups. CONCLUSION Comparable short- and mid-term outcomes and adverse events are found for primary OAGB and RYGB. OAGB is not inferior to RYGB as a primary bariatric procedure for the treatment of obesity.","Kaplan, Uri; Aboody-Nevo, Hadar; Gralnek, Ian M; Sherf-Dagan, Shiri; Dar, Ron; Mokary, Shams-Eldin; Hershko, Dan; Kopelman, Doron; Sakran, Nasser",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-021-05508-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34081274/,597

HIV-specific repertoires exhibit a high level of clonality in circulating cells, and high levels of somatic mutations within the antibody variable gene segments. It appears that many if not most antibodies in circulation bind to virus envelope conformations that are found only in complex oligomeric structures on virion particles or virus-like particles.

We sought to determine the relationship between recanalization, clinical outcomes, and final infarct volumes in acute ischemic stroke patients presenting with middle cerebral artery occlusion who underwent endovascular therapy and post-procedure magnetic resonance imaging. METHODS We identified 201 patients with middle cerebral artery occlusion. Patients with other occlusive lesions were excluded. Baseline clinical/radiological characteristics, procedural outcomes (including thrombolysis in cerebral infarction scores), clinical outcome scores (modified Rankin scores), and final infarct volumes on diffusion weighted imaging were retrospectively analyzed from a prospectively collected database. Favorable outcome is defined as 90-day modified Rankin score≤2. RESULTS Successful recanalization (thrombolysis in cerebral infarction grade 2b or 3) was achieved in 63.2% and favorable outcomes in 46% of cases. Mean infarct volume was 50.1 mL in recanalized versus 133.9 mL in non-recanalized patients (P<0.01) and 40.4 mL in patients with favorable outcomes versus 111.8 in patients with unfavorable outcomes (P<0.01). In multivariate analysis, thrombolysis in cerebral infarction≥2b, baseline National Institute of Health Stroke Scale, Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography scores, and age were identified as independent predictors of outcome. However, when infarct volumes were included in the analysis only final infarct volume and age remained significantly associated. CONCLUSIONS Successful recanalization leads to improved functional outcomes through a reduction in final infarct volumes. In our series, age and final infarct volume but not recanalization were found to be independent predictors of outcome, supporting the use of final infarct volume as surrogate marker of outcome in acute stroke trials.","Zaidi, Syed F; Aghaebrahim, Amin; Urra, Xabier; Jumaa, Mouhammad A; Jankowitz, Brian; Hammer, Maxim; Nogueira, Raul; Horowitz, Michael; Reddy, Vivek; Jovin, Tudor G",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.112.671594; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23160876/,597

Reports of its use are still limited. The objective of the trial was to evaluate the cost and benefits of LS in major lung resection surgery. METHODS A randomized blinded study of a consecutive series of 100 patients undergoing lobectomy was undertaken. After muscle-sparing thoracotomy and classification of lung fissures according to Craig-Walker, patients with fissure Grade 2-4 were randomized to Stapler group or LS group fissure completion. Recorded parameters were analysed for differences in selected intraoperative and postoperative outcomes. Statistical analysis was performed with the bootstrap method. Pearson's χ(2) test and Fisher's exact test were used to calculate probability value for dichotomous variables comparison. Cost-benefit evaluation was performed using Pareto optimal analysis. RESULTS There were no significant differences between groups, regarding demographic and baseline characteristics. No patient was withdrawn from the study; no adverse effect was recorded. There was no mortality or major complications in both groups. There were no statistically significant differences as to operative time or morbidity between patients in the LS group compared with the Stapler group. In the LS group, there was a not statistically significant increase of postoperative air leaks in the first 24 postoperative hours, while a statistically significant increase of drainage amount was observed in the LS group. No statistically significant difference in hospital length of stay was observed. Overall, the LS group had a favourable multi-criteria analysis of cost/benefit ratio with a good 'Pareto optimum'. CONCLUSIONS LS is a safe device for thoracic surgery and can be a valid alternative to Staplers. In this setting, LS allows functional lung tissue preservation. As to costs, LS seems equivalent to Staplers.","Bertolaccini, Luca; Viti, Andrea; Cavallo, Antonio; Terzi, Alberto",European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1093/ejcts/ezt445; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24031044/,597

Seroprevalences of EV-A71 and CVA6 increased from 32% and 54% at 6-11 months to >75% by 10 years of age. Antibody titers declined after 20 years, which could indicate infrequent re-exposure in older populations. Age profiles for acquiring infections and mean titers were comparable in the 3 testing years, despite the marked increase in incidence of CVA6-related HFMD from 2010. The uncoupling of changes in disease severity from the infection kinetics of CVA6 as we inferred from the seroprevalence data, rather than incidence of infection over the 11-year study period, provides further evidence for a change in its pathogenicity.","Kamau, Everlyn; Nguyen, Dung; Celma, Cristina; Blomqvist, Soile; Horby, Peter; Simmonds, Peter; Harvala, Heli",Emerging infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2709.204915; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34423767/,597

133752,COVID-19 and functional disability: current insights and rehabilitation strategies.,2020-08-04,"Background: The start of 2021 was marked by the initiation of a global vaccination campaign against the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Formulating an optimal distribution strategy under social and economic constraints is challenging. Optimal distribution is additionally constrained by the potential emergence of vaccine resistance. Analogous to chronic low-dose antibiotic exposure, recently inoculated individuals who are not yet immune play an outsized role in the emergence of resistance. Classical epidemiological modelling is well suited to explore how the behavior of the inoculated population impacts the total number of infections over the entirety of an epidemic. Methods: A deterministic model of epidemic evolution is analyzed, with seven compartments defined by their relationship to the emergence of vaccine-resistant mutants and representing three susceptible populations, three infected populations, and one recovered population. This minimally computationally intensive design enables simulation of epidemics across a broad parameter space. The results are used to identify conditions minimizing the cumulative number of infections. Results: When an escape variant is only modestly less infectious than the originating strain within a naïve population, there exists an optimal rate of vaccine distribution. Exceeding this rate increases the cumulative number of infections due to vaccine escape. Analysis of the model also demonstrates that inoculated individuals play a major role in the mitigation or exacerbation of vaccine-resistant outbreaks. Modulating the rate of host-host contact for the inoculated population by less than an order of magnitude can alter the cumulative number of infections by more than 20%. Conclusions: Mathematical modeling shows that optimization of the vaccination rate and limiting post-vaccination contacts can perceptibly affect the course of an epidemic. The consideration of limitations on post-vaccination contacts remains relevant for the entire duration of any vaccination campaign including the current status of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.","Rochman, Nash; Wolf, Yuri; V Koonin, Eugene",F1000Research,https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.52341.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34504684/,597

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective case series. SAMPLE POPULATION Castrated male goats (n = 15). METHODS The medical records of male goats admitted for obstructive urolithiasis were reviewed. Goats that underwent aurethrotomy performed in combination with or after a temporary tube cystostomy were included in the study population. Follow-up information was obtained through hospital records and telephone communication. RESULTS Thirteen of 15 goats were discharged from the hospital a median of 13 days (range, 7-25) after urethrotomy. Complications related to the urinary system occurred in 5 goats and included recurrent obstruction, urination from open urethrotomy, uroabdomen and intra-abdominal adhesions after removal of the Foley catheter, and incisional infection. Five of 7 goats with long-term follow-up (2-24 months after surgery) were healthy, with normal urinary function. The remaining 2 goats returned to the hospital with signs of reobstruction that were attributed to uroliths at necropsy in 1 goat. CONCLUSION Goats treated with urethrotomy for persistent urethral obstruction after temporary tube cystostomy generally survived the procedure. Normal long-term urinary function was obtained in some goats, although recurrence was the most common complication.

We hypothesized that laparoscopic abdominal sacrocolpopexy (ASC) gives better anatomic results than laparoscopic uterosacral ligament suspension (USLS), without increased complications. METHODS This was a retrospective cohort study of 290 patients who underwent laparoscopic suspensions in a 2-year period. Anatomic measurements using the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) system were collected. Subjective data were obtained from the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory Short-Form 20 (PFDI) questionnaire. The anatomic improvement for each stage and complication rates were analyzed. The difference in the risk of mesh erosion between patients undergoing concomitant total hysterectomy and those who had a prior hysterectomy was determined. In 102 patients with stage 2 prolapse, a comparison between ASC and USLS in anatomic and subjective results and complication rates was performed. RESULTS Anatomic success rates ranged between 86 % and 95 %. Overall mesh erosion rate was 1.2 %, showing no difference between concomitant total laparoscopic hysterectomy (0 %) and prior hysterectomy (2.1 %, p = 0.155). ASC resulted in statistically significantly better anterior-compartment support than USLS (p = 0.043). There was no difference in apex or posterior compartment position or in PFDI scores. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic ASC may be better than USLS for correcting anterior-compartment prolapse, with only a minor risk of mesh erosion.","Filmar, Gilad A; Fisher, Hilaire W; Aranda, Enrique; Lotze, Peter M",International urogynecology journal,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00192-014-2407-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24819328/,597

MATERIALS AND METHODS From January 2000 to December 2011, 1213 patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (up to three nodules) were screened. Of these, 132 patients with 132 subcapsular nodules (mean size, 3.0 cm; range, 1.2-5.0 cm) were enrolled in the study. After transarterial chemoembolization, percutaneous radiofrequency ablation was performed under ultrasound or C-arm cone-beam computed tomography guidance, on the same day or within 3 days. Local recurrence and survival curves were obtained using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS Technical success of treatment was achieved in 130 patients (98.5%). Major complications, including pleural effusion, secondary peritonitis, and liver abscess, occurred in 3 patients (2.3%); the incidence of complications was associated with the number of needle insertions (1-2 vs. 3-4, P=0.039, Fisher's exact test). No patients developed permanent sequelae, tumor seeding, or tumor bleeding. The 3-year local recurrence rate was 9.7%. Local recurrence was associated with the pretreatment serum des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin level (≤200 mAU/mL vs. >200 mAU/mL, P=0.019, log-rank test).

Currently, little is known about the utilisation and effectiveness of this approach. This review aims to determine (1) the proportion of women who used their stored eggs, and (2) the egg survival rate through vitrification, and the clinical pregnancy rate and live birth rate per 100 women partaking in the procedure, and among women who stored their eggs for medical reasons. METHODS AND ANALYSES This systematic review will be done according to the items listed in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. PubMed, Embase, Scopus, The Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and the Cochrane Library and Health Technology Assessment databases will be searched to identify eligible studies published since 2012. Two reviewers will independently appraise the eligibility and quality of the studies based on preset checklists and extract the data using a data extraction template. Outcomes of interest are proportion of women who used their stored eggs, egg survival rate, pregnancy rate and live birth rates. We will determine the presence heterogeneity among studies using the Cochrane's Q test. The percentage of total variation across studies, which is due to statistical heterogeneity, will be calculated using the I2 statistics. Outcomes of interest will be pooled together using metaprop programme STATA V.14. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION For this review, ethical committee approval is not required. We will use publically available data from previously published studies. The final report of the review will be disseminated through publication on national or international journal, and it will be presented on different scientific conferences.

137718,Past as Prologue: The Effects of the COVID-19 Economic Downturn on Medicaid Coverage for Podiatry Services.,2020-11-10,"Lonicera japonica (Caprifoliaceae) has been known as an anti-inflammatory herb in traditional Chinese medicine for thousands of years and is used constantly for upper respiratory tract infections. Luteolin, an active flavonoid compound isolated from Lonicera japonica, has a spectrum of biological activities, especially with antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. However, whether luteolin has a direct inhibitory effect on lung fibrosis has not been established. In this study, we examined the effects of luteolin on lung fibrosis both in vivo and in vitro. We found that oral administration of luteolin (10 mg/kg) efficiently suppressed the neutrophil infiltration as well as TNF-α and IL-6 elevation in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in bleomycin-instilled C57BL/6J mice. Luteolin also alleviated collagen deposition, TGF-β1 expression, and lung fibrosis upon bleomycin instillation. A similar tendency was observed in both early and delayed luteolin-treated groups. Next, our in vitro studies showed that luteolin inhibited TGF-β1-induced α-SMA, type I collagen, and vimentin expression in primary cultured mouse lung fibroblasts. Moreover, luteolin significantly blocked TGF-β1-mediated epithelial marker (E-cadherin) downregulation and mesenchymal cell markers (fibronectin and vimentin) upregulation, as well as retaining epithelial morphology in human alveolar epithelial-derived A549 cells. Additionally, luteolin could attenuate TGF-β1-induced Smad3 phosphorylation in both lung fibroblasts and A549 cells. These findings suggest that luteolin has a potent antifibrotic activity; this effect was mediated, at least in part, by inhibition of lung inflammation and suppression of myofibroblast differentiation as well as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.","Chen, Chiu-Yuan; Peng, Wen-Huang; Wu, Li-Chen; Wu, Chun-Chi; Hsu, Shih-Lan",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/jf1031668; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20958047/,597
137980,[Self-care for health professionals.],2020-04-01,"Disease-causing pathogens have been with humanity for as long as the species has existed, but the world has changed. The human population is increasing and becoming more globalised. Meanwhile, the international system remains unstable and biotechnology is advancing at a breakneck speed. Humans are coming into contact with new and re-emerging pathogens as they spread into previously uninhabited environments. Pathogens play an increasingly global role, and infectious disease is becoming less confined by geographical or climatic boundaries. In order to meet these new challenges, both states and the private sector have been building an increasing number of high-containment biological laboratories(HCBLs) that work with biosafety level (BSL) 3 and 4 pathogens. This rate has increased sharply since 11 September 2011, and most states that have the means to build such laboratories do so. Pathogens do not stop at borders, and the more prepared a state is to deal with them, the better for its national security. Although there is information available on the world's BSL-4 laboratories, none of it includes the proliferation of BSL-3 laboratories. This paper attempts to create a working database of the state of global HCBL proliferation. It seeks to analyse the data and to understand how we are dealing with this phenomenon, the risks involved, and the possible measures to be taken. The information is inevitably complex and certainly far from complete, but it is the author's hope that it will provide a sufficient basis from which to make useful, actionable inferences.","Peters, A",Revue scientifique et technique,https://doi.org/10.20506/37.3.2892; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30964462/,597
138435,Eye Banking: One Cornea for Multiple Recipients.,2020-09-16,"Background Tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) is a severe life-threatening perioperative complication. It is a rare condition caused by congenital and developmental anomalies of the trachea and/or the bronchus. It is often difficult to diagnose TBM before surgery as this congenital disease presents very few symptoms preoperatively and most often appears postoperatively. Case presentation and Review The study describes a case of cleft-lip-plate (CL/P) in a 7-month-old Japanese female with TBM and Tetralogy of Fallot syndrome. Before undergoing cleft-lip surgery, her TBM was not fully elucidated by preoperative examinations, and the operation was completed uneventfully. After the surgery, however, she started showing severe respiratory distress and developed hypoxia and bradycardia in the operating room. CPR was performed successfully, but a bronchoscopy revealed a severely collapsed airway, and the pathological condition was diagnosed as TBM occurred postoperatively. Eight months later, she died of sudden respiratory failure similar to that of the postoperative event caused by TBM. A literature review was conducted on the complications of CL/P from 1990 to 2017 in Japan. Conclusions It was hypothesized that CL/P with congenital heart disease (CHD) and TBM with CHD may crossover in relatively high rates. Currently, there are very few solutions available to treat severe airway obstruction related to TBM. This highlights the need for preoperative diagnosis of TBM as an important step in overcoming severe airway complications.","Hitosugi, Takashi; Mitsuyasu, Takeshi; Yokoyama, Takeshi",JPRAS open,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpra.2020.09.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33163607/,597

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of August 2020 there are more than 833,556 dead and over 24,587,513 people infected around the world. This pandemic has adversely affected many professions around the globe, including dentistry. COVID-19, caused by the Corona virus family, is transmitted mainly by direct contact with an infected person or through the spread of aerosol and droplets. Dentistry by nature is considered to be one of the most vulnerable professions with regards to the high risk of transmission between the dentist, dental team, and patients; therefore, a protocol for infection control and the prevention and spreading of the COVID-19 virus in dental settings is urgently needed.

Underlying immune cell activation is a likely culprit. Although immune cells are important for protection against invading pathogens, their chronic overactivation may lead to tissue damage and high blood pressure. Triggers that may initiate immune activation include viral infections, autoimmunity, and lifestyle factors such as excess dietary salt. These conditions activate the immune system either directly or through their impact on the gut microbiome, which ultimately produces chronic inflammation and hypertension. T cells are central to the immune responses contributing to hypertension. They are activated in part by binding specific antigens that are presented in major histocompatibility complex molecules on professional antigen-presenting cells, and they generate repertoires of rearranged T-cell receptors. Activated T cells infiltrate tissues and produce cytokines including interleukin 17A, which promote renal and vascular dysfunction and end-organ damage leading to hypertension. In this comprehensive review, we highlight environmental, genetic, and microbial associated mechanisms contributing to both innate and adaptive immune cell activation leading to hypertension. Targeting the underlying chronic immune cell activation in hypertension has the potential to mitigate the excess cardiovascular risk associated with this common and deadly disease.","Madhur, Meena S; Elijovich, Fernando; Alexander, Matthew R; Pitzer, Ashley; Ishimwe, Jeanne; Van Beusecum, Justin P; Patrick, David M; Smart, Charles D; Kleyman, Thomas R; Kingery, Justin; Peck, Robert N; Laffer, Cheryl L; Kirabo, Annet",Circulation research,https://doi.org/10.1161/circresaha.121.318052; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33793336/,597

AIM To ascertain the diagnostic performance of FIT in symptomatic adult primary care patients. METHODS Faecal samples from routine primary care practice in Oxfordshire, UK were analysed using the HM-JACKarc FIT method between March 2017 and March 2020. Clinical details were recorded. Patients were followed up for up to 36 months in linked hospital records for evidence of benign and serious (colorectal cancer, high-risk adenomas and bowel inflammation) colorectal disease. The diagnostic accuracy of FIT is reported by gender, age group and FIT threshold. RESULTS In 9896 adult patients with at least 6-month follow-up, a FIT result ≥10 µg Hb/g faeces had a sensitivity for colorectal cancer of 90.5% (95% CI 84.9%-96.1%), specificity 91.3% (90.8%-91.9%), positive predictive value (PPV) 10.1% (8.15%-12.0%) and negative predictive value (NPV) 99.9% (99.8%-100.0%). The PPV and specificity for serious colorectal disease were higher and the sensitivity and NPV lower than for colorectal cancer alone. The area under the curve for all adults did not change substantially by gender or by increasing the minimum age of testing. Using ≥10 µg Hb/g faeces, 10% of adults would be investigated to detect 91% of cancers, a number needed to scope of ten to detect one cancer. Using ≥7, ≥50 and ≥150 µg Hb/g faeces, 11%, 4% and 3% of adults would be investigated, and 91%, 74% and 54% cancers detected, respectively. CONCLUSION A FIT threshold of ≥10 µg Hb/g faeces would be appropriate to triage adult patients presenting to primary care with symptoms of serious colorectal disease. FIT may be used to reprioritise patients referred with colorectal cancer symptoms whose investigations have been delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Nicholson, Brian D; James, Tim; Paddon, Maria; Justice, Steve; Oke, Jason L; East, James E; Shine, Brian",Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1111/apt.15969; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32677733/,597

The Human Protein Atlas (HPA) project is a large-scale initiative aiming at mapping the entire human proteome using antibody-based proteomics and integration of various other omics technologies. The publicly available knowledge resource www.proteinatlas.org is one of the world's most visited biological databases and has been extensively updated during the last few years. The current version is divided into six main sections, each focusing on particular aspects of the human proteome: (i) the Tissue Atlas showing the distribution of the proteins across all major tissues and organs in the human body (ii) the Cell Atlas showing the subcellular localization of proteins in single cells; (iii) the Pathology Atlas showing the impact of protein levels for survival of patients with cancer; (iv) the Blood Atlas showing the expression profiles of blood cells and actively secreted proteins; (v) the Brain Atlas showing the distribution of proteins in human, mouse and pig brain; and (vi) the Metabolic Atlas showing the involvement of proteins in human metabolism. The HPA constitutes an important resource for further understanding of human biology, and the publicly available datasets hold much promise for integration with other emerging efforts focusing on single cell analyses, both on transcriptomic and proteomic level.

Proctoscopic extraction from the distal sigmoid colon and proximal rectum can be technically difficult. Using a transanal minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS) approach, RFBs can be safely removed, avoiding an abdominal operation with associated morbidity. Patients without clinical findings concerning for acute colonic perforation undergo bedside digital rectal examination and proctoscopic attempt at removal of RFB. If unsuccessful, patients undergo rectal examination under anesthesia with proctoscopy and attempted RFB removal. If the RFB cannot be easily removed, a TAMIS port is inserted into the anal canal and pneumorectum is established. A laparoscopic camera and instruments are then used to facilitate removal of the RFB. To date, TAMIS was successful in all 10 patients with RFB requiring an operation. All patients tolerated the procedure well and were discharged to home from the postoperative recovery room. Unfortunately, none of the patients presented for follow-up visits, but there were no known complications. This technique can be considered prior to laparotomy for patients with RFBs after failed digital examination with proctoscopy.","Zhao, B; Roper, M T; Tomassi, M J; Wenger, S J; Klaristenfeld, D",Techniques in coloproctology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10151-020-02396-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423162/,597

Here, we describe the first characterization of the O-linked oligosaccharides of salivary agglutinin identified by negative ion liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The dominating structures were neutral or monosialylated core 1 (Galbeta1-3GalNAcalpha1-Ser/Thr) and core 2 (Galbeta1-3(GlcNAcbeta1-6)GalNAcalpha1-Ser/Thr) structures extended by fucosylated oligo-N-acetyllactosamine units. Oligosaccharides detected as [M-H](-) or [M-2H](2)(-) ions ranged from the disaccharide Galbeta1-3GalNAcol up to structures of almost 4000 Da, corresponding to core 1/2 structures with five N-acetyllactosamine units and 11 fucoses. Fucose was found either as terminal or internal blood group H structures in type 1 (Galbeta1-3GlcNAcbeta1-R), type 2 (Galbeta1-4GlcNAcbeta1-R) and type 3 (Galbeta1-3GalNAcalpha1-Ser/Thr) units, where the chains also could be fucosylated on GlcNAc yielding repeated Lewis a/b or Lewis x/y structures. Sialylation was located either at the non-reducing end of the N-acetyllactosamine chains as sialyl-Lewis x or as sialyl-T (NeuAcalpha2-3Galbeta1-3GalNAcalpha1-Ser/Thr) type structures with or without further extension of the C-6 branch of GalNAc with neutral fucosylated N-acetyllactosamine chains. The data indicated that sialylation, fucosylation and type 1 N-acetyllactosamine termination are important regulatory elements for controlling the oligosaccharide chain length. Furthermore, it was shown that these regulatory oligosaccharide elements could be utilized by the pathogen Helicobacter pylori to colonize the oral cavity, reside in dental plaque and serve as a reservoir for reinfection after successful clearance of H. pylori gastric infection.","Issa, Samah; Moran, Anthony P; Ustinov, Sergey N; Lin, Jack Han-Hsing; Ligtenberg, Antoon J; Karlsson, Niclas G",Glycobiology,https://doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwq066; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20466654/,597

From 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2011, 92 of 9380 respiratory specimens were found to be positive for NL63 RNA by PCR, an overall prevalence of 1 %. NL63 viruses were circulating during all 3 years, but there was considerable yearly variation in prevalence and the month of peak incidence. Phylogenetic analysis comparing the genome sequences of the 16 Colorado NL63 viruses with those of the prototypical hCoV-NL63 and three other NL63 viruses from the Netherlands demonstrated that there were three genotypes (A, B and C) circulating in Colorado from 2005 to 2010, and evidence of recombination between virus strains was found. Genotypes B and C co-circulated in Colorado in 2005, 2009 and 2010, but genotype A circulated only in 2005 when it was the predominant NL63 strain. Genotype C represents a new lineage that has not been described previously. The greatest variability in the NL63 virus genomes was found in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the spike gene (nt 1-600, aa 1-200).

Potentially curative treatments (surgical resection, radiofrequency or liver transplantation) are only available for few patients, while transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) or systemic agents are the best treatments for intermediate and advanced stage disease. The identification of markers that allow us to choose the best treatment for the patient is urgent.Areas covered: In this review we summarize the potential biological markers to predict the efficacy of all treatment available in patients with HCC and discuss anew biomarker with ahigher potential of success in the next future.Expert opinion: HCC is aheterogeneous disease. Tumors are heterogeneous in terms of genetic alteration,with spatial heterogeneity in cellular density, necrosis and angiogenesis.This heterogeneity may affect prognosis and treatment. Tumor heterogeneity can be difficult to quantify with traditional imaging due to subjective assessment of images; the same for sampling biopsy, which evaluates only asmall part of the tumor. We think that combining multi-OMICSwith radiomics represents apromising strategy for evaluating tumor heterogenicity and for identifying biomarkers of response and prognosis.","Andrea, Casadei-Gardini; Giulia, Orsi; Francesco, Caputo; Giorgio, Ercolani",Expert review of anticancer therapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/14737140.2020.1712198; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31910040/,597

The aim of this review is a teaching approach devoted to hemophilia treaters in under-development countries. AREAS COVERED Current major challenges include the absence of the following therapeutic tools for all people with hemophilia (PWH) worldwide: hematological prophylaxis; well-coordinated multidisciplinary teams in specialized centers; joint aspiration of acute hemarthrosis; point-of-care ultrasonography (POC-US); exercise; treatment of synovitis by means of radiosynovectomy; treatment of mild hemophilic arthropathy with analgesics, anti-inflammatory agents, and rehabilitation medicine; intra-articular injections of corticosteroids, hyaluronic acid, platelet-rich plasma, and mesenchymal stem cells; and treatment of severe hemophilic arthropathy by surgical treatment. The future scenario in under-development countries should include all the aforementioned treatment tools plus the possibility of performing total joint arthroplasty in PWH with inhibitors; concomitant use of bypassing agents with emicizumab for PWH with inhibitors undergoing orthopedic surgery; and telemedicine. EXPERT OPINION Primary hematological prophylaxis is now the gold standard for the management of hemophilia. Acute hemarthrosis needs intense hematological management and articular aspiration; the articular situation should be scrutinized by POC-US. Synovitis can be controlled by radiosynovectomy. In cases of severe articular degeneration, surgical procedures might be required.","Rodriguez-Merchan, E Carlos",Expert review of hematology,https://doi.org/10.1080/17474086.2021.1977118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34482789/,597

In addition to physical health, there is increasing recognition of the need to understand the psychosocial impacts of COVID-19. The present study investigated psychosocial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on a help-seeking community sample of Canadian men, focusing on diverse aspects of their psychosocial well-being. Methods: A cross-sectional, open survey study design was used. Canadian adult men who were visiting an eHealth depression resource (HeadsUpGuys.org) were recruited to complete an online survey. Descriptive statistics, including means and standard deviations for continuous variables and frequency and percentages for categorical variables, were used to summarize survey responses. Regression analysis was utilised to identify factors associated with various mental health indicators (anxiety, depression, fear of COVID-19, suicidality). The Patient Health Questionnaire-4, Fear of COVID-19 Scale, and item 9 (suicidality item) from the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 were used to assess the mental health indicators. Results: A total of 434 men completed the study. Most respondents (79.3%; N = 344) indicated that their mental health was negatively affected by COVID-19, and two-thirds (65.5%; N = 284) conveyed that government-imposed physical distancing measures had negatively affected their mental health. Half the sample (51.2%; N = 222) reported at least moderate financial stress due to COVID-19. Nearly a third of respondents (31.1%; N = 135) reported that their current living situation has had a considerable or severe negative impact on their mental health since COVID-19. About two-fifths (37.7%; N = 94) of men felt that COVID-19 has had a negative impact on their relationship with their intimate partner. Nearly a third of respondents who were in a relationship (30.9%; N = 77) reported that they engaged in some type of abuse (primarily verbal abuse, 22.9%; N = 57) toward their intimate partner during COVID-19, and more than a quarter (27.3%; N = 68) reported being abused by their intimate partner (also primarily verbal abuse, 22.5%; N = 56). Just under half (42.2%; N = 183) of the respondents indicated experiencing suicidal ideation. Conclusion: These findings can help inform providers of health services to Canadian men, as well as policies that will be implemented during subsequent waves of COVID-19 or during future infectious outbreaks.","Ogrodniczuk, John S; Rice, Simon M; Kealy, David; Seidler, Zac E; Delara, Mahin; Oliffe, John L",Postgraduate medicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/00325481.2021.1873027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33402003/,597

Usually, the causal organism is not identified and treatment remains empiric. Recent computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging studies have challenged the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis of pneumonia, and epidemiologic studies are changing our perspective of what causes community acquired pneumonia, especially the role of viral pathogens and the frequent finding of multiple pathogens. The past decade has seen increasing overuse of empiric coverage of meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and antibiotic resistant Gram negative pathogens owing to inappropriate application of guidelines for healthcare associated pneumonia. Optimal treatment remains a matter for debate, especially in very sick patients, including the role of combination antibiotic therapy and corticosteroids. Pneumonia care bundles are being defined to improve outcomes.

DESIGN This was a prospective, controlled, blinded, and randomized study. Patient blinding was performed intraoperatively. Subjects were randomly assigned to the SprayShield™ or the control group in a 2:1 ratio. SETTING The study was conducted at the Clinic of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, at the University Hospital for Gynecology in Germany. PATIENTS Fifteen patients participated in this study; nine patients were assigned to the SprayShield™ and six patients to the control group. INTERVENTIONS During first operation (FLL) in the SprayShield™ group, the agent was applied to all myomectomy suture lines. Patients in the control group did not receive any anti-adhesion treatment, only good surgical practice. A second-look laparoscopy (SLL) was performed 8-12 weeks after myomectomy to evaluate adhesion formation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Main outcome measures were incidence, severity, and extent of uterine adhesions. RESULTS No significant differences were found between the two study groups. CONCLUSIONS SprayShield™ is easy to use. No serious adverse event related to SprayShield™ was observed. Efficacy data are inconclusive regarding the performance of SprayShield™.

148290,Medical-Surgical Nurses' Perceptions of Psychiatric Patients: A Review of the Literature With Clinical and Practice Applications.,2016,"SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is responsible for Covid-19 pandemic. In the early phase of infection, the single-strand positive RNA genome is translated into non-structural proteins (NSP). One of the first proteins produced during viral infection, NSP1, binds to the host ribosome and blocks the mRNA entry channel. This triggers translation inhibition of cellular translation. In spite of the presence of NSP1 on the ribosome, viral translation proceeds however. The molecular mechanism of the so-called viral evasion to NSP1 inhibition remains elusive. Here, we confirm that viral translation is maintained in the presence of NSP1. The evasion to NSP1-inhibition is mediated by the cis-acting RNA hairpin SL1 in the 5'UTR of SARS-CoV-2. NSP1-evasion can be transferred on a reporter transcript by SL1 transplantation. The apical part of SL1 is only required for viral translation. We show that NSP1 remains bound on the ribosome during viral translation. We suggest that the interaction between NSP1 and SL1 frees the mRNA accommodation channel while maintaining NSP1 bound to the ribosome. Thus, NSP1 acts as a ribosome gatekeeper, shutting down host translation or fostering SARS-CoV-2 translation depending on the presence of the SL1 5'UTR hairpin. SL1 is also present and necessary for translation of sub-genomic RNAs in the late phase of the infectious program. Consequently, therapeutic strategies targeting SL1 should affect viral translation at early and late stages of infection. Therefore, SL1 might be seen as a genuine 'Achille heel' of the virus.","Tidu, Antonin; Janvier, Aurelie; Schaeffer, Laure; Sosnowski, Piotr; Kuhn, Lauriane; Hammann, Philippe; Westhof, Eric; Eriani, Gilbert; Martin, Franck",RNA,https://doi.org/10.1261/rna.078121.120; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33268501/,597

Mathematical models can help answer these questions. In this article, the authors describe basic concepts in the mathematical modelling of infectious diseases, illustrate their use with a simple example, and present the results of influenza models. METHOD Description of the mathematical modelling of infectious diseases and selective review of the literature. RESULTS The two fundamental concepts of mathematical modelling of infectious diseases-the basic reproduction number and the generation time-allow a better understanding of the course of an epidemic. Modelling studies based on past influenza epidemics suggest that the rise of the epidemic curve can be slowed at the beginning of the epidemic by isolating ill persons and giving prophylactic medications to their contacts. Later on in the course of the epidemic, restricting the number of contacts (e.g., by closing schools) may mitigate the epidemic but will only have a limited effect on the total number of persons who contract the disease. CONCLUSION Mathematical modelling is a valuable tool for understanding the dynamics of an epidemic and for planning and evaluating interventions.","Mikolajczyk, Rafael; Krumkamp, Ralf; Bornemann, Reinhard; Ahmad, Amena; Schwehm, Markus; Duerr, Hans-Peter",Deutsches Arzteblatt international,https://doi.org/10.3238/arztebl.2009.0777; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20019862/,597

Some studies have shown that Xuebijing injection (XBJ) can exert an anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting the production of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and other cytokines. This study aimed to investigate the effect of XBJ on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its effects on IL-6 and tumor necrosis alpha TNF-α. METHODS A total of 42 patients, who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and treated with XBJ combined with routine treatment at Chongqing University Three Gorges Hospital between January 20, 2020, and March 11, 2020, were selected as the observation group. A control group comprising 16 patients who received routine treatment was also established, and cases were matched from the observation group on a 1:1 basis according to age, comorbidities, and mild and severe disease. The clinical symptoms, laboratory test indexes, and changes in computed tomography (CT) scans of patients in the two groups were observed at the time of admission and 7 days after treatment, and the time taken for the patients to produce a negative nucleic acid test was also recorded. RESULTS There were no significant differences in baseline data between the two groups. After treatment, there were significant improvements in IL-6 levels and body temperature in the observation group as compared with the control group. Particularly in severe patients, the reduction in body temperature in the observation group was greater than that in the control group (P<0.05). A higher number of patients in the observation group showed improved CT imaging results compared with the control group, and the time taken to produce a negative nucleic acid test was shorter in the observation group than in the control group; however, the differences were not statistically significant (P>0.05). Furthermore, there were no significant differences in TNF-α and IL-10 between the two groups.

Beam-walking tasks are used to assess vestibulomotor function. Brain injury in rodents can disrupt performance on both of these tasks. Developing novel paradigms that integrate tasks like these can reduce the need for multiple tests when attempting to assess multiple behaviors in the same animal. Using adult male rats, we evaluated the use of a modified beam-walking (MBW) apparatus as a surrogate indicator for anxiety. We used a model of blast-induced traumatic brain injury (bTBI). A total of 39 rats were assessed before and at 3, 6, 24, 72, and 168h either post- bTBI (n=33) or no-injury (n=6) using both EPM and MBW. A novel anxiety index was calculated that encompassed peeks and re-emergences on MBW. The proposed MBW anxiety index was compared with the standard anxiety index calculated from exploration into different sections of EPM. Post- bTBI, rats had an increased anxiety index when measured using EPM. Similarly, they peeked or fully emerged less out of the safe box on MBW. It was found that this novel MBW anxiety index captured similar aspects of behavior when compared to the standard anxiety index obtained from EPM. Further, these effects were dissociated from the effects of bTBI on motor function simultaneously measured on MBW. Over the course of 168h post-bTBI, rats gradually recovered on both EPM and MBW. The MBW apparatus succeeded at capturing and dissociating two separate facets of rat behavior, motor function and anxiety, simultaneously.","Sweis, Brian M; Bachour, Salam P; Brekke, Julia A; Gewirtz, Jonathan C; Sadeghi-Bazargani, Homayoun; Hevesi, Mario; Divani, Afshin A",Behavioural brain research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2015.09.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26367471/,597

This study focused on trends of face-to-face (FTF) bullying victimization and perpetration, cyberbullying victimization, relational bullying victimization, verbal bullying victimization, and physical bullying victimization, as well as characteristics of the youth involved. It also explored methodological and survey differences to help determine which factors contribute to variation from study to study. A systematic search found 91 studies reporting trends of bullying, from 1998 to 2017, that met predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The findings illustrate no significant time trend when looking at FTF bullying victimization, yet an increasing time trend for cyberbullying victimization. Additional trends begin to emerge when stratifying the findings by grade and gender, with FTF bullying victimization among boys declining, while FTF bullying victimization among girls is increasing. Across both FTF bullying victimization and cyberbullying victimization, younger adolescents report significantly more bullying than older adolescents, and this is consistent over time. Verbal and physical bullying victimization as well as FTF bullying perpetration have significantly declined over time. This study also identified key variables that contribute to the variation from trend study to trend study. The implications of these findings inform both policy and practice and provide insight into the overall scope of bullying within the United States.","Kennedy, Reeve S","Trauma, violence & abuse",https://doi.org/10.1177/1524838019888555; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31789118/,597
151147,Scientific Rigor in the Age of COVID-19.,2020-12-10,"The modulation of the characteristics of an MoS2 anode via substitutional doping, particularly N, P and Se, is vital for promoting the potassium-ion storage performances. However, these traditional chalcogen doping can only take the place of a sulfur element and not essentially change the inherent electrical nature of MoS2. Herein, novel Te-MoS2 materials have been synthesized via a simple hydrothermal process under Te doping. A half-metallic Te occupies the position of an Mo atom to form Te-S bonds, which is different from the same group Se element. After theoretical modeling and electrochemical measurements, it was observed that the formation of Te-S bonds can increase the electrical conductivity (about 530 times increment) and mitigate the mechanical stress to ensure the whole structural stability during the repeated insertion/extraction of K-ions. Moreover, the insertion of Te into the lattice of MoS2 generated the fractional phase transformation from 2H to the 1T phase of MoS2 and 1T&2H in-plane hetero-junction. Benefiting from these advantages, the 1T&2H Te-MoS2 anode delivered high capacities of 718 and 342 mA h g-1 at 50 and 5000 mA g-1, respectively, and an ultra-stable cycling performance (88.1% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 2 A g-1).

METHODS We conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed, CINAHL, and Embase databases from 2007 to 2020. Studies were eligible if they assessed whether user engagement with a smartphone app used by an individual to manage his or her CVD risk factors was associated with the CVD health behavior change or risk factor outcomes. For eligible studies, data were extracted on study and sample characteristics, intervention description, app user engagement measures, and the relationship between app user engagement and the CVD risk factor outcomes. App user engagement was operationalized as general usage (eg, number of log-ins or usage days per week) or self-monitoring within the app (eg, total number of entries made in the app). The quality of the studies was assessed. RESULTS Of the 24 included studies, 17 used a randomized controlled trial design, 4 used a retrospective analysis, and 3 used a single-arm pre- and posttest design. Sample sizes ranged from 55 to 324,649 adults, with 19 studies recruiting participants from a community setting. Most of the studies assessed weight loss interventions, with 6 addressing additional CVD risk factors, including diabetes, sleep, stress, and alcohol consumption. Most of the studies that assessed the relationship between user engagement and reduction in weight (9/13, 69%), BMI (3/4, 75%), body fat percentage (1/2, 50%), waist circumference (2/3, 67%), and hemoglobin A1c (3/5, 60%) found statistically significant results, indicating that greater app user engagement was associated with better outcomes. Of 5 studies, 3 (60%) found a statistically significant relationship between higher user engagement and an increase in objectively measured physical activity. The studies assessing the relationship between user engagement and dietary and diabetes self-care behaviors, blood pressure, and lipid panel components did not find statistically significant results. CONCLUSIONS Increased app user engagement for prevention and management of CVD may be associated with improved weight and BMI; however, only a few studies assessed other outcomes, limiting the evidence beyond this. Additional studies are needed to assess user engagement with smartphone apps targeting other important CVD risk factors, including dietary behaviors, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and hypertension. Further research is needed to assess mHealth user engagement in both inpatient and outpatient settings to determine the effect of integrating mHealth interventions into the existing clinical workflow and on CVD outcomes.","Spaulding, Erin M; Marvel, Francoise A; Piasecki, Rebecca J; Martin, Seth S; Allen, Jerilyn K",JMIR cardio,https://doi.org/10.2196/18834; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33533730/,597

An association between increased venous thromboembolism in patients with pneumonia-related to COVID-19 has not yet been well described. PATIENTS AND METHODS We aimed to illustrate cases of pulmonary thromboembolism in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome related to COVID-19 treated in our intensive care unit. The medical records of patients affected by COVID-19 with acute respiratory distress syndrome in our institute from 1/3/2020 to 31/3/2020 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS Our center registered a high prevalence of thromboembolic events among 62 patients affected by acute respiratory distress syndrome related to COVID-19 despite a regular antithrombotic prophylaxis. Out of these, 32 patients were transferred to other hospitals, and 30 were treated in our center. Venous thromboembolism was registered in 12 (19.3%) cases. In particular, 11 diagnoses of pulmonary embolism and 1 diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis were formulated. We described a case series of venous thromboembolism in nine patients treated in our Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Main pulmonary arteries were always involved in these patients. None of them died. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, critically ill patients with ARDS related to COVID-19 may have an increased risk of VTE that could be a leading cause of mortality. These patients require a high index of clinical suspicion and an accurate diagnostic approach, in order to immediately start an appropriate anticoagulant treatment.","Longhitano, Y; Racca, F; Zanza, C; Piccioni, A; Audo, A; Muncinelli, M; Santi, R; Kozel, D; Geraci, C; Taverna, M; Bonato, V; Cassini, F; Franceschi, F",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202009_22864; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32965007/,597

MATERIALS AND METHODS In this case-control study, 45 pregnant women infected with symptomatic COVID-19 were compared with 45 pregnant women infected with asymptomatic COVID-19. The cases included women were referred for delivery to hospitals of Hamadan Province and infected with COVID-19-related symptoms. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on the results of real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) detection. The control group included asymptomatic women who were referred for delivery to hospitals in Hamadan Province infected with COVID-19. Data were collected by a checklist. For the data analysis, the Stata version 12 was used (StataCorp, College Station, TX). RESULTS The odds of cesarean delivery in symptomatic women was more the fourfold higher (OR = 4.12, 95% CI (1.7, 10.05), p = .002). Moreover, the odds of LBW was significantly higher in symptomatic women (OR = 2.1, 95% CI (1.2, 6.29), p = .035). CONCLUSIONS Our findings showed that cesarean delivery and LBW were significantly higher in symptomatic women compared with asymptomatic women. In areas with high COVID-19 pandemics, the performance of the PCR test is recommended for all pregnant women upon admission for delivery.","Jenabi, Ensiyeh; Bashirian, Saeid; Khazaei, Salman; Masoumi, Seyedeh Zahra; Ghelichkhani, Samereh; Goodarzi, Firoozeh; Mirzaei, Mohammad","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",https://doi.org/10.1080/14767058.2020.1861599; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33322959/,597

Our aim was to understand how decisions to admit or not are made. We observed 55 decision-making events in six NHS hospitals. We interviewed 30 referring and 43 intensive care doctors about these events. We describe the nature and context of the decision-making and analysed how doctors make intensive care admission decisions. Such decisions are complex with intrinsic uncertainty, often urgent and made with incomplete information. While doctors aspire to make patient-centred decisions, key challenges include: being overworked with lack of time; limited support from senior staff; and a lack of adequate staffing in other parts of the hospital that may be compromising patient safety. To reduce decision complexity, heuristic rules based on experience are often used to help think through the problem; for example, the patient's functional status or clinical gestalt. The intensive care doctors actively managed relationships with referring doctors; acted as the hospital generalist for acutely ill patients; and brought calm to crisis situations. However, they frequently failed to elicit values and preferences from patients or family members. They were rarely explicit in balancing burdens and benefits of intensive care for patients, so consistency and equity cannot be judged. The use of a framework for intensive care admission decisions that reminds doctors to seek patient or family views and encourages explicit balancing of burdens and benefits could improve decision-making. However, a supportive, adequately resourced context is also needed.","Griffiths, F; Svantesson, M; Bassford, C; Dale, J; Blake, C; McCreedy, A; Slowther, A-M",Anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1111/anae.15272; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33141939/,597

156153,Safety of Psychotropic Medications in People With COVID-19: Evidence Review and Practical Recommendations.,2020-10-01,"BACKGROUND Over the past few decades, the popularity of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has grown considerably and along with it, scrutiny regarding its evidence base. While this is to be expected, and is in line with other health disciplines, research in CAM is confronted by numerous obstacles. This scoping review aims to identify and report the strategies implemented to address barriers to the conduct and application of research in CAM. METHODS The scoping review was undertaken using the Arksey and O'Malley framework. The search was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, EMCARE, ERIC, Scopus, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library, JBI and the grey literature. Two reviewers independently screened the records, following which data extraction was completed for the included studies. Descriptive synthesis was used to summarise the data. RESULTS Of the 7945 records identified, 15 studies met the inclusion criteria. Using the oBSTACLES instrument as a framework, the included studies reported diverse strategies to address barriers to the conduct and application of research in CAM. All included studies reported the use of educational strategies and collaborative initiatives with CAM stakeholders, including targeted funding, to address a range of barriers. CONCLUSIONS While the importance of addressing barriers to the conduct and application of research in CAM has been recognised, to date, much of the focus has been limited to initiatives originating from a handful of jurisdictions, for a small group of CAM disciplines, and addressing few barriers. Myriad barriers continue to persist, which will require concerted effort and collaboration across a range of CAM stakeholders and across multiple sectors. Further research can contribute to the evidence base on how best to address these barriers to promote the conduct and application of research in CAM.","Veziari, Yasamin; Kumar, Saravana; Leach, Matthew",BMC complementary medicine and therapies,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12906-021-03371-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34266441/,597
156259,A systematic review of tumor treating fields therapy for high-grade gliomas.,2020-06-23,"OBJECTIVE We investigated whether physical exercise interventions improve cognitive functioning in nondementia populations. METHODS We conducted a systematic review of meta-analyses including only randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Two reviewers completed a systematic search of PubMed, Embase, PsychInfo, and Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials. Study characteristics, effect size data, and heterogeneity estimates were extracted and presented in tabular form. Methodological quality was assessed by 2 reviewers using the AMSTAR-2 checklist. The validity of results was considered based on AMSTAR-2 scores and study characteristics. RESULTS We included 11 meta-analyses: 6 focused on disease-free older adults and 5 on mild cognitive impairment (MCI) excluding dementia. These meta-analyses summarized 97 unique RCTs. Methodological quality ranged from critically low to high. For overall cognitive functioning, which was the outcome of 6 meta-analyses, 1 showed improvement due to exercise interventions in disease-free older adults (g = 0.29, P < .01), while 2 reported nonsignificant effects. In patients with MCI, 3 meta-analyses reported significant benefits of exercise interventions on overall cognitive functioning (g = 0.25-0.57, P < .01). For cognitive domains such as attention and memory, there was limited evidence of beneficial effects of exercise demonstrated in either disease-free or MCI samples. CONCLUSIONS Exercise may improve overall cognitive functioning in disease-free older adults, but there is too little high-quality evidence to conclude whether this is achieved through improvement in any of the specific cognitive domains assessed. There is clearer evidence that exercise may improve cognitive functioning in MCI, but again there is limited evidence across most cognitive domains.","Turner, David T; Hu, Mandy X; Generaal, Ellen; Bos, Daniel; Ikram, M Kamran; Heshmatollah, Alis; Fani, Lana; Ikram, M Arfan; Penninx, Brenda W J H; Cuijpers, Pim",Journal of geriatric psychiatry and neurology,https://doi.org/10.1177/0891988720915523; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32295450/,597

METHODS This prospective cohort enrolled previously healthy term infants during inpatient or outpatient visits for acute URI or bronchiolitis during September to May 2004 to 2008. Illness severity was determined using an ordinal bronchiolitis severity score. Common respiratory viruses were identified by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS Of 648 infants, 67% were enrolled during inpatient visits and 33% during outpatient visits. Seventy percent had bronchiolitis, 3% croup and 27% URI. Among infants with bronchiolitis, 76% had respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), 18% human rhinovirus (HRV), 10% influenza, 2% coronavirus, 3% human metapneumovirus and 1% parainfluenza virus. Among infants with croup, 39% had HRV, 28% parainfluenza virus, 28% RSV, 11% influenza, 6% coronavirus and none human metapneumovirus. Among infants with URI, 46% had HRV, 14% RSV, 12% influenza, 7% coronavirus, 6% parainfluenza virus and 4% human metapneumovirus. Individual viruses exhibited distinct seasonal, demographic and clinical expression. CONCLUSIONS The most common infections among infants seeking care in unscheduled medical visits for URI or bronchiolitis were RSV and HRV. Demographic differences were observed between patients with different viruses, suggesting that host and viral factors play a role in phenotypic expression of viral illness.","Miller, E Kathryn; Gebretsadik, Tebeb; Carroll, Kecia N; Dupont, William D; Mohamed, Yassir A; Morin, Laura-Lee; Heil, Luke; Minton, Patricia A; Woodward, Kimberly; Liu, Zhouwen; Hartert, Tina V; Williams, John V",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0b013e31829b7e43; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23694832/,597

As RNA viruses may coevolve with their hosts, we sought to investigate the closest sister taxon to bats, the Eulipotyphla, and screened European hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) from Germany for CoV by nested reverse transcriptase PCR. A novel betacoronavirus species in a phylogenetic sister relationship to MERS-CoV and clade c bat CoVs was detected and characterized on the whole-genome level. A total of 58.9% of hedgehog fecal specimens were positive for the novel CoV (EriCoV) at 7.9 log10 mean RNA copies per ml. EriCoV RNA concentrations were higher in the intestine than in other solid organs, blood, or urine. Detailed analyses of the full hedgehog intestine showed the highest EriCoV concentrations in lower gastrointestinal tract specimens, compatible with viral replication in the lower intestine and fecal-oral transmission. Thirteen of 27 (48.2%) hedgehog sera contained non-neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV. The animal origins of this betacoronavirus clade that includes MERS-CoV may thus include both bat and nonbat hosts.","Corman, Victor Max; Kallies, René; Philipps, Heike; Göpner, Gertraude; Müller, Marcel Alexander; Eckerle, Isabella; Brünink, Sebastian; Drosten, Christian; Drexler, Jan Felix",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01600-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24131722/,597

The prognosis is mostly good but patients with high-risk cSCC have a greater risk of recurrence and death. The aim of the present study was to conduct a systematic review analyzing the prevalence, predictors and prognostic utility of sentinel lymph node (SLN) involvement in cSCC. We performed a published work search in Ovid MEDLINE and reviewed the reference lists of selected studies. Based on the 23 studies included in the systematic review, the proportion of patients with cSCC and positive SLN biopsy findings was 8% (95% confidence interval, 5.1-10.8%; I2 = 44.51%). We found no studies reporting on predictors of SLN involvement in cSCC or on the prognostic utility of this finding following adjustment for confounders. The rate of positive SLN in cSCC is less than previously reported. Criteria for recommending SLN biopsy as a staging tool for cSCC vary considerably from study to study, and none of the studies were large enough to reliably identify predictors of SLN positivity. No randomized controlled trials have yet analyzed whether SLN biopsy may improve the prognosis of cSCC. More studies are required on the prognostic value of SLN positivity and the associated risk factors in cSCC.","Tejera-Vaquerizo, Antonio; García-Doval, Ignacio; Llombart, Beatriz; Cañueto, Javier; Martorell-Calatayud, Antonio; Descalzo-Gallego, Miguel A; Sanmartín, Onofre",The Journal of dermatology,https://doi.org/10.1111/1346-8138.14342; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29701281/,597

Therefore, research efforts have focused on alternatives such as supplementation with collagen derivatives. The objective of this scoping review is to examine the extent, range, and nature of research, and to summarize and disseminate research findings on the effects of collagen derivatives in OA and cartilage repair. The purpose is to identify gaps in the current body of evidence in order to further help progress research in this setting. METHODS The databases Medline, Scopus, CENTRAL, TOXLINE, and CDSR were comprehensively searched from inception to search date. After studies selection against eligibility criteria, following recommended methods, data were charted from the retrieved articles and these were subsequently synthesized. Numerical and graphical descriptive statistical methods were used to show trends in publications and geographical distribution of studies. RESULTS The systematic literature search identified a total of 10,834 records. Forty-one published studies were ultimately included in the review, 16 of which were preclinical studies and 25 were clinical studies (including four systematic reviews/meta-analyses). Collagen hydrolysate (CH) and undenatured collagen (UC) were the two types of collagen derivatives studied, with a total of 28 individual studies on CH and nine on UC. More than a third of studies originated from Asia, and most of them have been published after 2008. Oral forms of collagen derivatives were mainly studied; three in vivo preclinical studies and three clinical trials investigated intra-articularly injected CH. In most of the clinical trials, treatment durations varied between 3 and 6 months, with the shortest being 1.4 months and the longest 11 months. All in vivo preclinical studies and clinical trials, regardless of their quality, concluded on beneficial effects of collagen derivatives in OA and cartilage repair, whether used as nutritional supplement or delivered intra-articularly, and whatever the manufacturers of the products, the doses and the outcomes considered in each study. CONCLUSIONS Although current evidence shows some potential for the use of CH and UC as an option for management of patients with OA, there is still room for progress in terms of laboratory and clinical research before any definitive conclusion can be made. Harmonization of outcomes in preclinical studies and longer randomized placebo-controlled trials in larger populations with the use of recommended and validated endpoints are warranted before collagen derivatives can be recommended by large scientific societies.","Honvo, Germain; Lengelé, Laetitia; Charles, Alexia; Reginster, Jean-Yves; Bruyère, Olivier",Rheumatology and therapy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40744-020-00240-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33068290/,597

The Treatment of Brain AVM Study (TOBAS) was designed to assess curative treatments in the management of AVMs. The purpose of our study is to provide a care trial context to brain AVM patients. METHODS TOBAS is a pragmatic, prospective study including 2 randomized controlled trials and a registry. All AVM patients can be recruited. The preferred management modality will be predetermined prior to randomization by the team based on clinical judgment. Patients eligible for both conservative and interventional management will be randomly allocated conservative or curative treatment. Randomization will be stratified by a treatment modality (surgery, radiosurgery or embolization) and minimized according to a history of previous rupture and Spetzler-Martin grade. A second randomization will allocate eligible patients to embolization/no embolization prior to surgery or radiosurgery. The primary outcome of the study is death (any cause) or disabling stroke (mRS>2) at 10 years. All patients managed according to clinical judgment alone will be included in the registry. The study is registered under: wwwTrials.gov, ID: NCT02098252. EXPECTED RESULTS A minimum recruitment of 540 patients is required to show that treatment can reduce the primary outcome by 10 % (from 25 to 15 %); 440 patients will be needed to show a 10 % increase in angiographic occlusion for a good clinical outcome with pre-embolization. CONCLUSION The trial is designed to offer optimal and verifiable care to patients with brain AVMs in spite of the uncertainty.

Herein, we compare various types of esophagojejunostomy in terms of the technical aspects and postoperative outcomes. METHODS A total of 48 patients underwent LTG for gastric cancer by the same surgeon. Four types of intracorporeal esophagojejunostomies have been applied after LTG: type A, a conventional anvil head method; type B, an OrVil™ system method; type C, a hemi-double stapling technique with anvil head; and type D, side-to-side esophagojejunostomy with linear stapler. We describe and review these types of esophagojejunostomy using a step-by-step approach. RESULTS The mean reconstruction times were longer for types A and B than for types C and D (p < 0.05). In terms of complications, there were five cases (10.4%) of anastomosis leakage, which was more common in types A and B: two cases in each of type A and B and one case in type C. Moreover, anastomosis stricture requiring intervention was more common in types A and B (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS To date, there are no reliable reconstruction methods after LTG. Therefore, special care is needed to prevent postoperative complication regardless of methods; also, technical innovations to support development of the safest methods of esophagojejunostomy are warranted.","Shim, Jung Ho; Yoo, Han Mo; Oh, Seong Il; Nam, Myung Jin; Jeon, Hae Myung; Park, Cho Hyun; Song, Kyo Young",Gastric cancer : official journal of the International Gastric Cancer Association and the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10120-012-0207-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23097123/,597

Two reviewers will independently screen the titles and abstracts retrieved from a literature search, as well as potentially relevant full-text articles. General characteristics, potential effect modifiers, and outcome data will be extracted from the included studies, and the risk of bias will be appraised. Conflicts at all levels of screening and abstraction will be resolved through team discussions. After describing the results of the review, if appropriate, a random effects meta-analysis and network meta-analysis will be conducted in a frequentist setting, assuming equal heterogeneity across all treatment comparisons and accounting for correlations induced by multi-arm studies using a multivariate normal model. DISCUSSION Our systematic review will address the uncertainties in the use of pharmacological or non-pharmacological treatments, and their relative efficacy, for acute and subacute LBP. These findings will be useful for patients, healthcare providers, and policymakers.

162324,COVID-19 serosurveillance positivity in general population: comparison at different times,2021,"BACKGROUND Natural orifice specimen extraction - NOSE laparoscopy is a promising technique that avoids mini-laparotomy, possibly reducing postoperative pain, wound infections and hospital stay. Recent systematic reviews have shown that postoperative morbidity associated with laparoscopically assisted gastrectomies is similar to that after open gastrectomies. More specifically, there is no difference in wound infection rate. The study objective was to evaluate whether postoperative morbidity and hospital stay may be reduced by transoral specimen extraction after laparoscopically assisted gastrectomy for early gastric cancer (EGC). MATERIAL AND METHODS A prospective, nonrandomized study was carried out starting in August 2012. Data from all patients operated on during the first year, with minimum 18 months follow-up, were collected to assess feasibility, oncologic results, postoperative morbidity, hospital stay and functional results. Overall, 14 patients were included and followed-up. After gastric resection, a 3 cm opening was created on the gastric stump, and the specimen, divided into three segments stitched one to each other, was sutured to the gastric tube and retrieved through the mouth. RESULTS Postoperative morbidity was 7.14% (1/14): one case of pneumonia. No wound infection occurred. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 4.7 ± 1.0 days. CONCLUSIONS NOSE laparoscopic subtotal gastrectomy is feasible and safe, with similar oncologic results as LAG, but decreased morbidity and hospital stay.","Hüscher, Cristiano G S; Lirici, Marco Maria; Ponzano, Cecilia",Minimally invasive therapy & allied technologies : MITAT : official journal of the Society for Minimally Invasive Therapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/13645706.2016.1254094; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27802070/,597
162338,Tinjauan sistematis: gambaran kesehatan mental perawat yang menangani pasien COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND Cryptosporidium is a protozoan parasite of humans and other animals worldwide and is one of the greatest contributors to human diarrhoeal illness. Transmission can occur indirectly via contaminated food or water, or directly via contact with animals or other infected people. Risk exposures are often identified from outbreak investigations, but a subset of cases remains unexplained, and sources for sporadic disease and pathways to infection are still unclear. Given the few systematic syntheses of reported evidence in industrialised populations, the aim of this review is to consolidate the literature to describe exposures associated with human cryptosporidiosis in industrialised countries, specifically including the UK, and describe any differences between outbreak-associated and sporadic disease. METHODS/DESIGN Where relevant, methods will follow the recommendations made in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Three steps will be used to identify the literature including electronic database searching using PubMed, Scopus, Embase and Web of Science; reference list trawling; and an exploration of the grey literature. Screening of results will be undertaken by two reviewers using pre-defined criteria. Studies conducted in industrialised countries and reporting on human subjects will be included. All observational studies will be included where they report exposures and relevant quantitative results. Data will be extracted using a standardised form. Study quality will be assessed using the ROBINS-I tool. Data will be summarised presenting the papers' main findings including population under study, outcomes, and exposures, and whether these were considered outbreak or sporadic cases. A narrative summary will also be included. Where populations are appropriate, available data will be pooled in a meta-analysis combining the significant exposures across studies. DISCUSSION This review aims to consolidate the evidence for transmission routes and exposures for Cryptosporidium in industrialised countries, with particular reference to how these may apply to the UK. In addition, the review will seek to describe differences between outbreak and sporadic cases. This will help to identify those most vulnerable, highlighting pathways where interventions and public health response may be appropriate.

Materials and Methods From September 2016 to December 2016, patients who were not virgins and did not have pelvic inflammation or obliteration of the cul-de-sac who underwent NOTES hysterectomy or ovarian cystectomy (OC) were included in the study. Results Transvaginal NOTES was performed smoothly in six patients, two patients (mean age 35 years, mean body mass index [BMI] 25) received an OC and four patients (mean age 49 years, mean BMI 27) underwent a hysterectomy. One patient with a hysterectomy received concurrent adhesiolysis. The mean surgical times were 74 and 75 min and blood loss was 50 and 87.5 ml in the OC and hysterectomy groups, respectively. One patient with a hysterectomy had a postoperative fever with 38°C last for 2 days. Pain scores were 0 at 48 h postoperatively in both groups. Conclusion Transvaginal NOTES is a feasible and safe technique for hysterectomy and OC in our patients and those in previous reports. This procedure was minimally invasive with no scars on the abdomen as well as little pain.","Ding, Dah-Ching; Chu, Tang-Yuan; Hong, Mun-Kun",Ci ji yi xue za zhi = Tzu-chi medical journal,https://doi.org/10.4103/tcmj.tcmj_127_17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29296049/,597
163714,Current advances in pharmacological treatments for patients with COVID-19,2021,"Introduction: Despite gains in global coverage of childhood vaccines, many children remain undervaccinated. Vaccination campaigns also known as Supplemental Immunization Activity (SIA) are commonly conducted to reach those who are undervaccinated. However, reaching these children even during an SIA is challenging. We evaluated the effectiveness of an SIA in reaching zero dose children. Methods: We conducted a prospective study in 10 health center catchment areas in Southern province, Zambia in November 2020. About 2 months before the measles and rubella SIA we developed aerial satellite maps which were then used to enumerate and survey households. Zero dose children were identified during this exercise. After the SIA, households with zero dose children identified before the SIA were targeted for mop up vaccination and to assess if they were vaccinated during the SIA. A Bayesian geospatial model was used to identify factors associated with zero-dose status before the campaign and produce fine-scale prevalence maps. Models were used to identify factors associated with measles zero-dose children reached in the campaign and identify optimal locations for additional vaccination sites. Results: Before the vaccination campaign, 4% of children under 9 months were DTP zero-dose and 17% of children 9-60 months were measles zero-dose. Of the 461 measles zero-dose children identified before the vaccination campaign, 338 (73.3%) were vaccinated during the campaign, 118 (25.6%) were reached by a targeted mop-up activity. The presence of other children in the household, younger age, greater travel time to health facilities, and living between health facility catchment areas were associated with zero-dose status. Mapping zero-dose prevalence revealed substantial heterogeneity, both within and between catchment areas. Several potential locations were identified for additional vaccination sites. Conclusion: Fine-scale variation in zero-dose prevalence and the impact of accessibility to healthcare facilities on vaccination coverage were identified. Geospatial modeling can aid targeted vaccination activities.","Arambepola, R.; Yang, Y.; Hutchinson, K.; Mwansa, F. D.; Doherty, J. A.; Bwalya, F.; Ndubani, P.; Musukwa, G.; Moss, W.

How well a crisis like COVID-19 is handled depends, in many ways, on how the public perceives the crisis and risks related to it, through the media. Therefore, how the situation is framed, what are seen as key issues, and who is perceived to be in charge, can have implications for the outcome. This article analyses Icelandic news media content about COVID-19 at the onset of the pandemic by using theories of agenda-setting and framing. The objective is to examine how the pandemic was framed, which topics were highlighted and who was given a voice in the media. We specifically investigate what kind of leadership was present during the earliest stages of the pandemic. Using content analysis, we examined media content about COVID-19 from 21 Icelandic media outlets from January 1st to March 31st, 2020. Our conclusions show that from the start of the pandemic, health related subjects, such as disease prevention, COVID-19 statistics and the health care system were salient in the media, though tourism and economic factors were also quite prominent. Furthermore, experts were at the helm of communication whilst politicians remained more in the background. The dissemination of instructions and rules illuminates the relationship between the experts and politicians, as the experts were given a voice in the media to communicate such information. The politicians, however, directly cited the experts, thanked them or endorsed them, when they spoke on instructions and rules in the media.","Gylfadottir, A. G.; Olafsson, J.

Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are more vulnerable to changes due to their limited resources. However, the capabilities of information technologies and processes of knowledge management can assist these enterprises to survive and respond appropriately to changes. Thus, this study aims to assess the extent to which information technology capabilities influence the responsiveness of SMEs to challenges that have emerged during the coronavirus crisis. It also investigates the degree to which knowledge management affects such a relationship in the context of Saudi Arabia. The study includes developing a survey as a data collection method. The responses from 136 SMEs were used to make an analysis and, consequently, draw a conclusion. It has been found that IT capabilities positively influence SMEs' responsiveness to changes brought by coronavirus, through supporting work flexibility and providing a wide range of options in the supply chain, processes, and sales. It further found that knowledge management mediates the relationship between IT capabilities and SMEs' responsiveness.","Azyabi, N.

This can be an effective approach for theoretical and conceptual teaching, but it is challenging to provide practical laboratory experiences. The objective here is to design a hands-on laboratory experience that can safely be undertaken by students remotely and that has substantial educational content. A new experiment was designed featuring a bifilar pendulum that students build themselves from readily available low-cost materials. This simple vibrating system has a surprisingly rich set of interesting physical characteristics that provide several important learning points. Initial trials indicate good student experience with the new experiment, notably an appreciation for the “do-it-yourself” aspect of the apparatus construction. The self-directed features and multiple learning features of the new student experiment make it attractive for use during Covid-19 times and beyond.

While stepping into the corridor of the 21st century, the utility of remote sensing and GIS techniques in various fields has made things understandable and thus enhances the ways of investigation for better decision making and management. The paper presents the Landsat Satellite series based Land Surface Temperature retrieval concerning land use/ land cover changes over Lahore District, Punjab, Pakistan. The Spatiooral analysis was performed from 1980-2020. We availed high-resolution Landsat and Sentinel-2 Satellite imagery to perform Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Supervised classification. Cloud-free satellite data was acquired from June, July, or August. Data pre-processing including atmospheric and terrain corrections were performed using ERDAS Imagine. The Red, NIR, and Thermal bands were utilized for LST estimation. ArcGIS 10.22 was used for making maps, analysis, and interpretations. The Spatiooral analysis of LULC and LST for the area indicates a great urbanization trend over the past forty years. People are migrating from small towns and villages to the metropolitan city of Pakistan for their livelihoods, and settlements. The built-up/urban land has expanded over the period with excessive construction that has affected the Land surface temperature. The area where human activity has increased shows higher LST's as compared to green lands. The excessive construction has taken off the agricultural land, while the River Ravi still flows with a changing course and less water table. The COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020 put everything on lockdown had an impact on environmental restoration due to fewer emissions and human activities. The overall classification accuracy of the images yielded substantial-high Kappa statistics of 80 %, 88%, 82%, 82.41%, and 87.76% for 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, and the 2020 images, respectively. The unplanned urbanization is leading the Lahore District to serious environmental issues and climate change impacts.

Blood glucose (BG) monitoring was less frequent (Q2h vs. Q1h in our standard IIP) and the BG target higher (150-199 mg/dl vs. 120-160 mg/dl). We sought to validate the safety and effectiveness of the COVID-19 IIP. We reviewed the medical records of 40 adult patients admitted with COVID-19 from 3/2020-5/2020 who were treated with either standard IIP (n=20) or COVID-19 IIP (n=20) to compare safety (hypoglycemia) and effectiveness (achievement of BG target, mean BG.) All results (Table) are reported as mean ± SD. Four patients in the standard IIP group and 2 in the COVID-19 IIP did not achieve target BG before IIP discontinuation. Preliminary results using our modified COVID-19 IIP show that it is safe and effective in controlling severe hyperglycemia, achieving its distinct BG target in a similar timeframe and without any increased risk of hypoglycemia despite reduced BG monitoring frequency. We conclude that our COVID-19 IIP can be used to safely manage hyperglycemia while protecting patients and HCWs as the pandemic continues.","Athonvarangkul, Diana Bak Leigh B.; Zheng, Cindy D'Ambrosi Julie Siner Jonathan Honiden Shyoko Inzucchi Silvio E.",Diabetes,https://doi.org/10.2337/db21-873-p,597

Our proposed system is able to monitor a number of people simultaneously, and therein we use a high-resolution direction of arrival (DOA) detection for finding closely separated targets. So, it effectively increases the number of target detection and reduces the cost by reducing the number of sensors. Furthermore, our proposed system is capable of identifying the sleep position of each monitored person by selecting appropriate target features and using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The breathing analysis involves designing an optimum filter for estimating both the breathing rate and the noiseless breathing waveform. In addition, we use the radar in a bedroom environment above a bed where two subjects sleep next to each other. The accuracy of the breathing monitoring subsystem is more than 97% for human subjects in the bedroom compared with a reference sensor. Also, the correct rate for sleep position detection is more than 83%.","Alizadeh, M.; Shaker, G.; Safavi-Naeini, S.; Ieee,",2020 Ieee 20th International Conference on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering,https://doi.org/10.1109/bibe50027.2020.00136,597

Its popularity and use in remote telehealth and rehabilitation have gained more importance and application with the current COVID-19 pandemic situation. The benefits of gamification and the use of virtual reality (VR) games in rehabilitation therapy and telerehabilitation have been particularly well demonstrated in post-stroke patients. In this study, we present our pilot study using a game-based therapy approaches for the upper limb (UL) rehabilitation in elderly post-stroke patients in Singapore. The aim of the study is to develop a smart multi-sensory musical assistive system, called SilverTune, to promote the rehabilitation outcomes of elderly post-stroke patients. The SilverTune is like a musical instrument which is highly adaptable to provide six types of music audios and play interactions to cater for various elderly's preferences and therapeutic movement requirements. SilverTune can also quantitatively record therapeutic data, analyze performance in real time, and give multi-modal feedback to both elderly and therapist. It is designed to produce a variety of digital audios like drum, saxophone, bell, harp, etc. via changing the shape and the interaction behaviours of the users. A SilverTune mobile app was developed as a companion mobile app for SilverTune music therapy. The app can play the digital contents, which is activated by SilverTune. Furthermore, the app can record user's profile and the data input from SilverTune for future analysis by the therapist. Two games were developed to play using SilverTune device. The first is a horse racing game where the horse moves around a racetrack. The second is a table tennis game whereby the table tennis ball is required to be served across the net to gain points. The horse racing game facilitated shoulder flexion and extension, whereas the table tennis game facilitated shoulder horizontal abduction and adduction. If the movement of the SilverTunes device is detected by the accelerometer, the horse or bat will run or swing forward. If no movement is detected, then the horse or bat will be stationary. Participants' self-perceived level of performance and satisfaction were shown to have significant improvements after the intervention phase. Particpants were also assessed before and after interventions using Fugl Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity (FMA-UE), Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) scores with improvements in passive joint motion. Post-intervention questionnaire found that many participants liked SilverTune games due to its novelty, audio/visual effects and that it helped them to stay focused during therapy. SilverTune can be potentially used as a telerehabilitation tool for the current COVID-19 pandemic situation to support a safe high-quality care at a reduced cost. © 2021 IEEE.","Luo, Z.; Durairaj, P.; Lau, C.

The stellar atmospheric parameters of the primary star were obtained through the spectral fitting as follows: $T_{eff}=6990\pm117 K$, $\log g=4.25\pm0.26 cm/s^2$, $[Fe/H]=-0.45\pm0.03 dex$. The original spectra obtained by European Southern Observatory (ESO) were processed with IRAF package by us. Based on the ESO blue-violet spectra, TYC 6408-989-1 was concluded as a marginal Am (Am:) star with a spectral type of kA3hF1mA5 IV-V identified through the MKCLASS program. The observed light curves were analyzed through the Wilson-Devinney code. The final photometric solutions show that TYC 6408-989-1 is a marginal contact binary with a low mass ratio (q=0.27). The temperature of the secondary component derived through the light curve analysis is significantly higher than main sequence stars. In addition, TYC 6408-989-1 is a poor thermal contact binary. The temperature differences between the two components is about 1800K. TYC 6408-989-1 should be located in the oscillation stage predicted by the thermal relaxation oscillations theory (TRO) and will evolve into the shallow contact stage eventually. The very short period (less than one day), marginal Am peculiarity and quit large rotational velocity ($v\sin i \simeq 160 km s^{-1}$) make TYC 6408-989-1 became a challenge to the cut-off of rotation velocities and periods of Am stars.

168647,Environmental effects of the COVID-19 pandemic from a (marine) ecological perspective,2020,"The number of people in food crisis around the world is increasing, exacerbated by the challenges of COVID-19 and a rapidly changing climate. Major crop yields are projected to decrease in low-latitude regions due to anthropogenic climate change, making tropical and sub-tropical food systems particularly vulnerable to climate shocks. Increased cultivation of breadfruit (Artocarpus altilis), often categorized as a neglected and underutilized species (NUS), has been suggested as an agricultural adaptation pathway for food insecure tropical and subtropical regions, due to its potential to enhance climate resilience and overall sustainability of low-latitude agricultural systems. To better understand breadfruit’s cultivation suitability and geographic range in current and future climates, we employ a diverse set of observations and models to delineate the current climatically viable breadfruit range, and assess the climatically viable breadfruit range in the future (2061-2080) under stabilization and high emission scenarios. We find that the area of suitable breadfruit range within the tropics and subtropics is projected to decrease ∼4.4% in the stabilization scenario and ∼4.5% in the high emission scenario. In Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands, yield quality and consistency show minimal decreases under the high emission scenario, with increases in total suitable area under both scenarios. In contrast, in Latin America and the Caribbean, the current range of breadfruit suitability is projected to contract ∼10.1-11.5% (stabilization-high emission). Present and future model suitability outputs suggest that opportunities to successfully expand breadfruit cultivation over the next several decades exist in sub-Saharan Africa, where food insecurity is coincidentally high. However, in all regions, high emission scenario conditions reduce the overall consistency and quality of breadfruit yields compared to the stabilization scenario. Our results have the potential to inform global food security adaptation planning and highlight breadfruit as an ideal NUS to incorporate in food security adaptation strategies in a changing climate.","Yang, Lucy; Zerega, Nyree; Horton, Daniel E.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.01.462801,597
169212,Clinical characterization and Genomic analysis of COVID-19 breakthrough infections during second wave in different states of India,2021-07-15,"Bioinformatic research relies on large-scale computational infrastructures which have a non-zero carbon footprint. So far, no study has quantified the environmental costs of bioinformatic tools and commonly run analyses. In this study, we estimate the bioinformatic carbon footprint (in kilograms of CO2 equivalent units, kgCO2e) using the freely available Green Algorithms calculator (www.green-algorithms.org). We assess (i) bioinformatic approaches in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), RNA sequencing, genome assembly, metagenomics, phylogenetics and molecular simulations, as well as (ii) computation strategies, such as parallelisation, CPU (central processing unit) vs GPU (graphics processing unit), cloud vs. local computing infrastructure and geography. In particular, for GWAS, we found that biobank-scale analyses emitted substantial kgCO2e and simple software upgrades could make GWAS greener, e.g. upgrading from BOLT-LMM v1 to v2.3 reduced carbon footprint by 73%. Switching from the average data centre to a more efficient data centres can reduce carbon footprint by ~34%. Memory over-allocation can be a substantial contributor to an algorithm’s carbon footprint. The use of faster processors or greater parallelisation reduces run time but can lead to, sometimes substantially, greater carbon footprint. Finally, we provide guidance on how researchers can reduce power consumption and minimise kgCO2e. Overall, this work elucidates the carbon footprint of common analyses in bioinformatics and provides solutions which empower a move toward greener research.","Grealey, Jason; Lannelongue, Loïc; Saw, Woei-Yuh; Marten, Jonathan; Meric, Guillaume; Ruiz-Carmona, Sergio; Inouye, Michael",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.08.434372,597

However, viruses undergo frequent recombination, which makes it difficult to trace their evolutionary history using traditional phylogenetic methods. Here, we present a phylogenetic workflow, virDTL, for analyzing viral evolution in the presence of recombination. Our approach leverages reconciliation methods developed for inferring horizontal gene transfer in prokaryotes, and, compared to existing tools, is uniquely able to identify ancestral recombinations while accounting for several sources of inference uncertainty, including in the construction of a strain tree, estimation and rooting of gene family trees, and reconciliation itself. We apply this workflow to the Sarbecovirus subgenus and demonstrate how a principled analysis of predicted recombination gives insight into the evolution of SARS-CoV-2. In addition to providing confirming evidence for the horseshoe bat as its zoonotic origin, we identify several ancestral recombination events that merit further study.","Zaman, Sumaira; Sledzieski, Samuel; Berger, Bonnie; Wu, Yi-Chieh; Bansal, Mukul S.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.12.456131,597

The need for research mentorship in Africa is well-recognised. However, there is scarce literature on the development of such programmes and their potential impacts on students and young researchers in Africa (SYRIA). This study documents the development of the CORE Africa Research Mentorship Scheme (CARMS), and reports the outcomes and challenges experienced over a two-year period, from 2018 to 2020. 41 mentors and mentees from Cameroon, Uganda and Nigeria participated in the programme. Mentors were based in Africa and the UK, while mentees were all based in Africa. Mentees gained knowledge and skills in various research areas including proposal writing, research methods, data analysis, report writing and research publication. Nine mentees gained their first research publication through the CARMS and three successfully completed their first grant proposal. Three mentees were supported by their mentor to develop PhD research proposals and five others gained skills that helped them secure paid research jobs. Eleven mentees have ‘graduated’ from the programme, seven of which are currently enrolled as trainee mentors. Mentees appreciated the opportunity to improve on their research skills and felt that the programme gave them a ‘safe’ environment to freely express their concerns. Main challenges encountered were: difficulty finding suitable mentors, communication barriers, poorly defined mentorship goals, dealing with mentee’s lack of knowledge/experience of ‘basic’ research concepts and funding limitations. This programme had several positive impacts on the knowledge and skills of mentees and demonstrates the importance of mentorship in research capacity strengthening. Sustaining such programmes requires investments in training and development, to ensure that mentees are continuously and adequately supported.","Ngongalah, Lem; Rawlings, Ngwa Niba; Musisi, James; Awanchiri, Kimonia; Akwah, Emmanuella; Ngeh, Etienne; Ssemwanga, Andrew",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.29.428492,597

In this study, we report a novel variant carrying the L452R mutation that emerged from a local B.1.362 lineage, B.1.362+L452R. The L452R mutation is associated with the Delta and Epsilon variants and was shown to cause increased infection and reduction in neutralization in pseudoviruses. Indeed, the B.1.362+L452R variant demonstrated a X4-fold reduction in neutralization capacity of sera from BNT162b2-vaccinated individuals compared to a wild-type strain. The variant infected 270 individuals in Israel between December 2020 and March 2021, until diminishing due to the gain in dominance of the Alpha variant in February 2021. This study demonstrates an independent, local emergence of a variant carrying a critical mutation, L452R, which may have the potential of becoming a variant of concern and emphasizes the importance of routine surveillance and detection of novel variants among efforts undertaken to prevent further disease spread.","Mor, O.; Mandelboim, M.; Fleishon, S.; Bucris, E.; Bar-Ilan, D.; Linial, M.; Lustig, Y.; Mendelson, E.; Zuckerman, N.

Talent management has undergone a dynamic development in recent years. It has recently become a frequently discussed concept among business and academics alike and one of the priorities of the modern management of all companies. The paper also presents the results of research carried out on a sample of 137 human resources managers. Respondents who participated in the questionnaire survey are human resources managers in companies operating in the Slovak Republic at national and international markets. Data were collected using the online questionnaire. For the research, two research hypotheses were established. The hypotheses aimed to determine whether there are statistically significant relationships between the scale of talent recruitment and selection process over the past year;the change in the management and organizational style of the company during the COVID-19 pandemic;the existence of the statistically significant relationship between the budget allocated to talent management and headhunting practices over the last year. The hypotheses were verified using correlation analysis and the methods of inductive statistics. Testing the statistically significant relationships verified hypothesis H1. It confirmed the existence of statistically significant relationships between the scale of the talent recruitment and selection process over the past year and the change in management and organization of the company during the COVID-19 pandemic. The hypothesis H2 was rejected. It stated the absence of statistically significant relationships between the budget for talent management in the organization during the COVID-19 pandemic and the competition for qualified talent for the last year. The questionnaire survey results pointed how human resources managers in companies operating in the Slovak Republic perceive the situation associated with the current COVID-19 pandemic. The findings identified the pandemic impact on talent management and how human resources managers see human resource management's future and priorities.","Tomcikova, L.; Svetozarovova, N.; Coculova, J.",Marketing and Management of Innovations,https://doi.org/10.21272/mmi.2021.2-08,597

When evaluating service quality in public transportation systems, one of the most important factors is customer satisfaction. The increase in service quality increases the usage of public transport system utilization and it helps to solve many problems such as traffic congestion, air and noise pollution and energy consumption. For this purpose, the SERVQUAL model is extended with two new criteria related to Industry 4.0 and the pandemic to understand and evaluate the service quality of public transport systems. New criteria added into the SERVQUAL model and a novel P-SERVQUAL 4.0 (Pandemic SERVQUAL 4.0) model is presented. The novel service quality evaluation model is constructed as a three level hierarchical structure to evaluate public transport systems during the pandemic. Then, the evaluation model is modeled as a multi criteria decision making problem and a novel AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) integrated WASPAS (Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment) under interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy (IVIF) environment methodology is employed. A real case application to evaluate Istanbul public transport systems is presented in this study. The proposed novel model is applied to evaluate the most used public transportation alternatives such as IETT Bus, Metrobus, Tram, Metro and Marmaray, in Istanbul. By the application of P-SERVQUAL 4.0 model;as a result of this study, Marmaray is determined as the best alternative. The proposed methodology can be used by public or private organizations to improve their strategies and operations to adapt Industry 4.0 and prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19).

We analysed the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody and T cell responses in previously infected (recovered) or uninfected (naive) individuals that received mRNA vaccines to SARS-CoV-2. While previously infected individuals sustained higher antibody titers than uninfected individuals post-vaccination, the latter reached comparable levels of neutralization responses to the ancestral strain than previously infected individuals 7 days after the second vaccine dose. T cell activation markers measured upon spike or nucleocapsid peptide in vitro stimulation showed a progressive increase after vaccination in the time-points analysed. Comprehensive analysis of plasma neutralization using 16 authentic isolates of distinct locally circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants revealed a range of reduction in the neutralization capacity associated with specific mutations in the spike gene: lineages with E484K and N501Y/T (e.g., B.1.351 and P.1) had the greatest reduction, followed by lineages with L452R (e.g., B.1.617.2) or with E484K (without N501Y/T). While both groups retained neutralization capacity against all variants, plasma from previously infected vaccinated individuals displayed overall better neutralization capacity when compared to plasma from uninfected individuals that also received two vaccine doses, pointing to vaccine boosters as a relevant future strategy to alleviate the impact of emerging variants on antibody neutralizing activity.","Lucas, C.; Vogels, C.

By equipping and presenting it as a dynamic centre for collections-based research we are enabling active development of the Sedgwick’s relationship with the scientific research community. Furthermore, it will enable the Sedgwick to deliver public engagement in ways that enhance the existing ‘traditional’ museum offer.

Using a suite of stochastic continuous-time Markov chain models we examine the impact of latent and chronic infection on the mean time to extinction of the infection. Our findings indicate that the mean time to pathogen extinction is increased for infectious diseases which cause exposed/latent infection prior to full infection and that the extinction time is increased further if these exposed individuals are also capable of transmitting the infection. A chronic infection stage can decrease or increase the mean time to pathogen extinction and in particular this depends on whether chronically infected individuals incur disease-induced mortality and whether they are able to transmit the infection. We relate our findings to specific infectious diseases that exhibit latent and chronic infectious stages and argue that infectious diseases with these characteristics may be more difficult to manage and control.,"Xander, O’Neill White Andy Clancy Damian Ruiz-Fons Francisco Gortázar Christian",Mathematics,https://doi.org/10.3390/math9091007,597

The study included sera from 358 individuals who had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 between January and May 2020. Samples were collected at 6 and 12 months after onset. The titers of IgG to the viral nucleocapsid protein (NP) and receptor-binding domain of the spike protein (RBD) were measured by CLEIA. The nAb titer was determined using lentivirus-based pseudovirus or authentic virus. Antibody titers of NP-IgG, RBD-IgG, and nAbs were higher in severe and moderate cases than in mild cases at 12 months after onset. While the nAb levels were likely to confer adequate protection against wild-type viral infection, the neutralization activity to recently circulating variants in some of the mild cases (~30%) was undermined, implying the susceptibility of reinfection to the variants of concerns (VOCs).

We sought to evaluate secular trends in patient enrollment on global oncology trials of drugs and/or biological agents coincident with trends in the pandemic through 10/31/2020. Methods: This time-series study of global oncology clinical trial patient enrollment relied on data from the Medidata Enterprise Data Store, which comprises studies using the RAVE electronic data capture platform, and eCDC. We quantified the number of patients enrolling on oncology trials according to contiguous pandemic waves between 01/05/2020 and fixed right censoring at 10/31/2020. For this study, we defined pandemic waves empirically through review of peaks and nadirs of global case counts/week from eCDC data: wave 1 (01/05/2020- 05/02/2020), wave 2 (05/03/2020-08/22/2020), wave 3 (08/23/2020-10/31/2020). We used negative binomial regressions to evaluate associations between time periods (i.e., waves) and counts of new trial enrollees and time periods and counts of new COVID-19 patients. Results: A total of 54,752 patients enrolled in 1,176 oncology trials world-wide during the observation period: 14,888 patients during wave 1, 19,631 patients during wave 2, and 20,233 patients during wave 3 of the pandemic. Compared to wave 1, the incidence of new trial enrollees increased by 10% in wave 2 (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 1.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.95-1.26) and by 29% in wave 3 (IRR 1.29, 95% CI: 1.10-1.52). Over the same period, 47,336,995 people were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection: 3,481,165 patients during wave 1, 20,205,244 patients during wave 2, and 23,650,586 patients during wave 3. Compared to wave 1, the incidence of new COVID-19 patients increased by 617% in wave 2 (IRR 6.17, 95% CI: 2.76-13.77) and by 1,155% (IRR 11.55, 95% CI: 4.61-28.95) in wave 3. Conclusions: Despite substantial increases in the incidence of COVID19 following the first wave of the pandemic, the number of patients enrolled in oncology clinical trials increased notably during the same period.

Design/methodology/approach Qualitative data was collected using 30 in-depth interviews from University students, using purposive sampling and the data was subjected to thematic analysis. The interview was done through the Zoom application. Findings The results reveal that the key variables that expedite the adoption process among Generation Z is Observability, Country of Origin, Brand and Word of mouth. Observability is the most influential variable, followed by word of mouth in the adoption of the vaccine. This study holds much importance to the marketers, to come up with carefully orchestrated campaigns to demonstrate the success of the vaccine, which could influence a faster rate of adoption. Research limitations/implications The research is limited to University students who belong to Generation Z, the studies on other demographic groups could reveal other interesting insights. A quantitative study examining the relationship of the adoption and other variables will conform to the results of the study. Practical implications The study will allow marketers to come up with effective promotion strategies to encourage the adoption of the COVID 19 vaccine. The emphasis should be given to triggering word of mouth and improving the observability of the effectiveness of the vaccine. Social implications The strategies to encourage the adoption of the vaccine could result in reducing the effects of pandemics and further spread of the virus. Originality/value This study holds much importance to the marketers to come up with carefully orchestrated campaigns to demonstrate the success of the vaccine, which could influence a faster rate of adoption. The study also contributes to the consumer behavior literature by addressing the existing research gap.","Jose, S.",Young Consumers,https://doi.org/10.1108/yc-01-2021-1276,597

In this study, we investigated infodemiologic trends in symptomatology associated with the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) following the spread of SARS-CoV-2 Lambda variant in Peru, enabling infodemiologic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in regions with high circulation of this new variant. Weekly Google Trends scores were obtained for key symptom keywords between March 1st, 2020 and July 4th, 2021, whilst case count data were obtained from Peruvian Ministry of Health. Multiple time series linear regression was used to assess trends in each score series, using the week of December 27th as cutoff for emergence of the Lambda variant. The significance of such trends was tested for each time period, before and after the cutoff date. A total 2,075,484 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections in Peru in relation to Google Trends data were analyzed. After Lambda variant emergence, searches for diarrhea demonstrated a change from a negative to positive correlation with weekly case counts and anticipated dynamic changes in case counts by 1-5 weeks. Searches for shortness of breath and headache remained consistently positively correlated to weekly case counts before and after Lambda emergence. No changes in searches for other common cold symptoms were observed, while no specific trends were observed for taste loss or smell loss. Diarrhea, headache, and shortness of breath appear to be the most important symptoms for infodemiologic tracking the current outbreak in Peru and other regions with high circulation of SARS-CoV-2 Lambda variant.","Henry, B.

We then constructed a fear index for COVID-19 using data from the Baidu Index. Based on the findings, conditional skewness reacts negatively to daily growth in total confirmed cases, indicating that the pandemic increases stock market crash risk. Moreover, the fear sentiment exacerbates such risk, especially with regard to the impact of COVID-19. In other words, when the fear sentiment is high, the stock market crash risk is more strongly affected by the pandemic. Our evidence is robust for the number of daily deaths and global cases.","Liu, Zhifeng; Huynh, Toan Luu Duc; Dai, Peng-Fei",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.08030v2.pdf,597

I identify themes of the disruption of academic work, of care and care practices, and of critiques of injustice and inequity within academia, but also argue that the ways in which these topics are instantiated-through distinctive repertoires of humor and of emotional honesty, positivity, and gratitude-are central to performances of academic life.

181555,Letter to the Editor: Note on published research on the effects of COVID-19 on the environment without sufficient depth of science,2020-05-20,"Chromatin insulator proteins mediate the formation of contacts between distant insulator sites along chromatin fibers. Long-range contacts facilitate communication between regulatory sequences and gene promoters throughout the genome, allowing accurate gene transcription regulation during embryo development and cell differentiation. Lack of insulator function has detrimental effects often resulting in lethality. The Drosophila insulator protein Suppressor of Hairy wing [Su(Hw)] is not essential for viability, but plays a crucial role in female oogenesis. The mechanism(s) by which Su(Hw) promotes proper oogenesis remains unclear. To gain insight into the functional properties of chromatin insulators, we further characterize the oogenesis phenotypes of su(Hw) mutant females. We find that mutant egg chambers frequently display an irregular number of nurse cells, have poorly formed microtubule organization centers (MTOC) in the germarium, and show mislocalized Gurken (Grk) in later stages of oogenesis. Furthermore, eggshells produced by partially rescued su(Hw) mutant females exhibit dorsoventral patterning defects that are identical to defects found in spindle mutants or in piRNA pathway mutants. Further analysis reveals an excess of DNA damage in egg chambers, which is independent of activation of transposable elements, and that Gurken localization defects and oogenesis progression are partially rescued by mutations in mei-41 and chk1 genes. In addition, we show that Su(Hw) is required for chromosome integrity in dividing neuroblasts from larval brains. Together, these findings suggest that Su(Hw) plays a critical role in maintaining genome integrity during germline development in Drosophila females as well as in dividing somatic cells.","Hsu, Shih-Jui; Stow, Emily C.; Simmons, James R.; Wallace, Heather A.; Lopez, Andrea Mancheno; Stroud, Shannon; Labrador, Mariano",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/551002,597
181769,Pathology of the digestive tract and liver with COVID-19,2020,"Background - During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the immediate threat of illness and mortality is not the only concern. In the United States, COVID-19 is not only causing physical suffering to patients, but also great levels of adverse sentiment (e.g., fear, panic, anxiety) among the public. Such secondary threats can be anticipated and explained through sentiment analysis of social media, such as Twitter. Methods - We obtained a dataset of geotagged tweets on the topic of COVID-19 in the contiguous United States during the period of 11/1/2019 - 9/15/2020. We classified each tweet into ""adverse"" and ""non-adverse"" using the NRC Emotion Lexicon and tallied up the counts for each category per county per day. We utilized the space-time scan statistic to find clusters and a three-stage regression approach to identify socioeconomic and demographic correlates of adverse sentiment. Results - We identified substantial spatiotemporal variation in adverse sentiment in our study area/period. After an initial period of low-level adverse sentiment (11/1/2019 - 1/15/2020), we observed a steep increase and subsequent fluctuation at a higher level (1/16/2020 - 9/15/2020). The number of daily tweets was low initially (11/1/2019 - 1/22/2020), followed by spikes and subsequent decreases until the end of the study period. The space-time scan statistic identified 12 clusters of adverse sentiment of varying size, location, and strength. Clusters were generally active during the time period of late March to May/June 2020. Increased adverse sentiment was associated with decreased racial/ethnic heterogeneity, decreased rurality, higher vulnerability in terms of minority status and language, and housing type and transportation. Conclusions - We utilized a dataset of geotagged tweets to identify the spatiotemporal patterns and the spatial correlates of adverse population sentiment during the first two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. The characteristics of areas with high adverse sentiment may be relevant for communication of containment measures. The combination of spatial clustering and regression can be beneficial for understanding of the ramifications of COVID-19, as well as disease outbreaks in general.","Hohl, A.; Choi, M.; Medina, R.; Wan, N.; Wen, M.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.15.21260543v1?rss=1,597

The co-infection model is shown to exhibit the dynamical property of backward bifurcation when the associated reproduction number is less than unity. Furthermore, it is shown that TB and HPV re-infection parameters ($varphisst{p} neq 0$ and $sigmasst{t} neq 0$) as well as TB exogenous re-infection term ($varepsilonsst{1} neq 0$) induced the phenomenon of backward bifurcation in the oncogenic HPV-TB co-infection model. The global asymptotic stability of the disease-free equilibrium of the co-infection model is also proven not to exist, when the associated reproduction number is below unity. The necessary conditions for the existence of optimal control and the optimality system for the co-infection model is established using the Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. Uncertainty and global sensitivity analysis are also carried out to determine the top ranked parameters that drive the dynamics of the co-infection model, when the associated reproduction numbers as well as the infected populations are used as response functions. Numerical simulations of the optimal control model reveal that the intervention strategy which combines and implements control against HPV infection by TB infected individuals as well as TB treatment control for dually infected individuals is the most cost-effective of all the control strategies for the control and management of the burden of oncogenic HPV and TB co-infection.","Omame, A.; Okuonghae, D.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.15.20195297v1?rss=1,597

RECENT FINDINGS Interleukin-12p40 and interferon-gamma-blockers may lead to increased incidence of infections with intracellular bacteria, parasites, and fungi. In addition, we may see viral infections with interferon-gamma-blockers. Increased risk of infections is unlikely with either interleukin-1- or interleukin-15-blockers. Interleukin-6-blockers may lead to increased risk of infection with extracellular bacteria, viruses, parasites and fungi. SUMMARY In tumor necrosis factor knockout mice, increased susceptibility to pathogens are reported that are normally controlled by granuloma formation. In patients treated with tumor necrosis factor-blockers, a two-fold increase of granulomatous infections, predominantly reactivation of latent tuberculosis, is found. The infections detected in tumor necrosis factor knockout mice were accurate for predicting the infections observed when using tumor necrosis factor-blockers. If a similar correlation exists for other cytokines, the use of interferon-gamma and interleukin-12p40 blockers, and possibly interleukin-6 blockers, will lead to an increased risk for severe infections. Care should be taken when new cytokine blockers/antagonists are introduced.","van de Vosse, Esther; van Agtmael, Michiel A",Current opinion in rheumatology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17917545/,597

OBJECTIVES To provide convalescent whole blood donor screening strategies for patients recovering from COVID-19. METHODS We recruited COVID-19 recovering patients who met our defined inclusion criteria for whole blood donation. All blood units were screened for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA by real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and SARS-COV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against the S1 domain. RESULTS We screened 180 blood units from patients recovering from COVID-19. All results were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and 87.2% were positive for SARS-COV-2 IgG antibodies in the plasma. CONCLUSIONS Blood component units from recovering COVID-19 patients are safe. Plasma units with positive IgG antibodies could serve as an efficient passive immunization for COVID-19 patients. Moreover, in the face of increased transfusion demand for treatment of anemia and coagulation dysfunction in critical ill COVID-19 patients, red blood cells units and random platelets units from convalescent donors can be safely transfused.","Mandel, Mathilda; Gurevich, Michael; Mandelboim, Michael; Amital, Howard; Achiron, Anat",The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33443334/,597

MATERIALS AND METHODS After the institutional review board approved the study and written consent was obtained from patients, 40 patients (25 female, 15 male; mean age, 42.8 years +/- 12.3 [standard deviation]) underwent thin-section CT at 51.8 days +/- 20.2 after onset of SARS symptoms. Twenty of the 40 patients underwent follow-up thin-section CT at 140.7 days +/- 26.7 after symptom onset. Lung findings were scored according to extent and then grouped in three categories (ground-glass opacity, interstitial opacity, and air trapping) for analysis. Mean CT scores for each finding in the various patient subgroups were compared by using the Mann-Whitney test. Clinical parameters and scores were evaluated for correlation by using Spearman rank correlation analysis. Mean scores for each finding were compared between the two serial examinations by using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test. RESULTS Air trapping, ground-glass opacity, and reticulation were found in 37 (92%), 36 (90%), and 28 (70%) of 40 patients, respectively, at initial thin-section CT examination and in 16 (80%), 14 (70%), and 10 (50%) of 20 patients, respectively, at follow-up examination. Scans from patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) had a significantly higher score for ground-glass opacity than did those from patients without ARDS (P = .009). A comparison of scores for the serial thin-section CT examinations indicated a significant reduction in the extent of ground-glass opacity (P < .001) and interstitial opacity (P < .001) but not in that of air trapping (P = .38) at follow-up examination. At initial thin-section CT, scores for ground-glass opacity, interstitial opacity, and air trapping correlated with age; those for ground-glass opacity and air trapping, with peak C-reactive protein level. At the second examination, scores for ground-glass opacity and interstitial opacity correlated with peak lactate dehydrogenase level; that for air trapping, with age and peak C-reactive protein level. CONCLUSION Thin-section CT scores correlated with clinical and laboratory parameters in patients after SARS. Although ground-glass opacity and interstitial opacity resolve over time, air trapping persists.","Chang, Yeun-Chung; Yu, Chong-Jen; Chang, Shan-Chwen; Galvin, Jeffrey R; Liu, Hon-Man; Hsiao, Cheng-Hsiang; Kuo, Ping-Hong; Chen, Kuan-Yu; Franks, Teri J; Huang, Kou-Mou; Yang, Pan-Chyr",Radiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16055695/,597
191280,Community-based study links skin rashes to COVID-19.,2021-05-01,"An imported carrier stallion (A) from Europe was implicated in causing an extensive outbreak of equine viral arteritis (EVA) on a Warmblood breeding farm in Pennsylvania, USA. Strains of equine arteritis virus (EAV) present in the semen of two carrier stallions (A and G) on the farm were compared to those in tissues of foals born during the outbreak, as well as viruses present in the semen of two other stallions that became persistently infected carriers of EAV following infection during the outbreak. The 2822 bp segment encompassing ORFs 2-7 (nt 9807-12628; which encode the G(S), GP3, GP4, G(L), M and N proteins, respectively) was directly amplified by RT-PCR from semen samples and foal tissues. Nucleotide and phylogenetic analyses confirmed that virus present in the semen of stallion A initiated the outbreak. The genomes of viruses present in most foal tissues (10/11) and serum from an acutely infected mare collected during the outbreak were identical to that of virus present in the lung of the first foal that died of EVA. Virus in the placenta of one foal differed by one nucleotide (99.9% identity) from the predominant outbreak virus. The relative genetic stability of viruses that circulated during the outbreak contrasts markedly with the heterogeneous virus populations variously present in the semen of persistently infected stallions on the farm. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the carrier stallion can be a source of genetic diversity of EAV, and that outbreaks of EVA can be initiated by the horizontal aerosol transmission of specific viral variants that occur in the semen of particular carrier stallions.","Balasuriya, U B; Hedges, J F; Nadler, S A; McCollum, W H; Timoney, P J; MacLachlan, N J",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10466790/,597

Our studies on the organization of the transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) have shown that the structure of these viruses is more complex. Different electron microscopy techniques, including cryomicroscopy of vitrified viruses, revealed the existence of an internal core, most probably icosahedral, in TGEV virions. Disruption of these cores induced the release of elongated ribonucleoprotein complexes. Ultrastructural analysis of freeze-substituted TGEV-infected swine testis (ST) cells showed characteristic intracellular budding profiles as well as two types of virions. While large virions with an electron-dense internal periphery are seen at perinuclear regions, smaller viral particles exhibiting compact internal cores of poligonal contours are more abundant in areas closer to the plasma membrane of the cell. These data strongly suggest that maturation events following the budding process are responsible for the formation of the internal core shell, the new structural element that we have recently described in extracellular infectious TGEV virions.","Risco, C; Antón, I M; Muntión, M; González, J M; Carrascosa, J L; Enjuanes, L",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9782301/,597
192974,[SAFE SURGICAL PRACTICE IN THE ERA OF COVID-19].,2020-06-01,"Murine coronavirus mutants resistant to neutralization with soluble receptors were isolated to study the receptor-binding site on the S proteins since such mutants were expected to have mutations in an important site for receptor-binding. We have isolated five soluble receptor-resistant (srr) mutants which had mutations of a single amino acid at 3 different positions in S protein. Srr mutant 11 with an amino acid change at position 65 (Leu to His) in the S1 subunit showed an extremely reduced binding by virus overlay protein blot assay. However srr mutants with a mutation at 1114 (Leu to Phe) (srr mutants 3, 4 and 7) or 1163 (Cys to Phe) (srr mutant 18) in the S2 subunit had receptor-binding activity similar to that of wild type cl-2. These results suggest that an amino acid at position 62 located in a conserved region among MHV strains is in particular important for receptor binding. We also discuss why srr mutants with a mutation in S2 showed high resistance to neutralization by soluble receptor, irrespective of their binding to MHV receptors.","Saeki, K; Ohtsuka, N; Taguchi, F",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9782259/,597

METHOD Totally 4 371 children with clinical diagnosis of ALRTI during the period from March 2007 to February 2015 seen in Beijing Children's Hospital were recruited into this study. Patients were divided into 4 groups by age, including 1 890 cases in < 1 year group, 788 cases in 1-3 years group, 553 cases in 3-6 years group, 1140 cases in ≥6 years group. One nasopharyngeal aspirate specimen was collected from each patient. RT-PCR methods were applied to detect 9 common respiratory viruses including HCoVs (including HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and so on. Clinical features of ALRTI with single HCoVs infection were analyzed and compared with hospitalized ALRTI cases with single RSV infection in the same period. RESULT (1) Totally 2 895 cases were positive for at least one virus in this study in 4 371 ALRTI patients (positive rate 66.23%), in which 147 cases were positive for HCoVs infection (positive rate 3.36%). (2) Positive rates of HCoVs in each year from 2007 to 2014 were 6.11%, 3.79%, 4.69%, 4.31%, 2.38% 2.10%, 0.77% and 2.65%, respectively. The mean positive rates of HCoVs for each month from January to December were 2.53%, 2.12%, 3.63%, 6.68%, 1.53%, 3.77%, 3.92%, 3.00%, 2.15%, 5.26%, 3.01% and 2.80%. (3) Detection results of each subtypes of HCoVs in total 4 371 pediatric ALRTI patients were: 48 cases positive for HCoV-OC43(1.10%), 32 cases positive for HCoV-229E(0.73%), 25 cases positive for HCoV-NL63 (0.57%), 27 cases positive for HCoV-HKU1 (0.62%). (4) Positive rates of HCoVs infection in <1 year group, 1-3 years group, 3-6 years group and ≥ 6 years group were 4.13%, 5.08%, 2.71% and 1.23%, respectively. There were significant differences in positive rates of HCoV among groups (χ² = 27.218, P<0.01). (5) There were 16 hospitalized cases with single infection of HCoVs in this study, of which 12 cases were diagnosed as bronchopneumonia, 3 cases developed acute laryngeal obstruction, 2 cases had acute bronchial asthma attack. Common clinical manifestations included cough (14 cases), gasping (13 cases), dyspnea (9 cases), fever (6 cases), hoarseness (4 cases), laryngeal stridor (4 cases) and abnormality on chest X-ray (including fuzzy lung texture, patchy shadow and consolidation) (12 cases).

CONCLUSION HCoVs are pathogens of ALRTI in children, The overall positive rate of HCoVs was 3.36% in this study. The clinical manifestations and severity of ALRTI caused by single HCoVs was comparable to that of ALRTI with single RSV infection in children.","Qian, Yi; Xie, Zhengde; Ren, Lili; Liu, Chunyan; Xiao, Yan; Xu, Baoping; Yang, Yan; Qian, Suyun; Geng, Rong; Shen, Kunling",Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26757973/,597
194064,Impact of a Transfusion-free Program on Patients Undergoing Pancreaticoduodenectomy.,2016,"The interaction of viruses with host cell receptors is the initial step in viral infection and is an important determinant of virus host range, tissue tropism, and pathogenesis. The complement regulatory protein decay-accelerating factor (DAF/CD55) is an attachment receptor for enterovirus 70 (EV70), a member of the Picornaviridae, commonly associated with an eye infection in humans known as acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis. In early work, the EV70 receptor on erythrocytes, responsible for its hemagglutinating activity, was shown to be sensitive to neuraminidase, implying an essential role for sialic acid in virus attachment. Here, we extend these results to show that cell surface sialic acid is required for EV70 binding to nucleated cells susceptible to virus infection and that sialic acid binding is important in productive infection. Through the use of site-directed mutagenesis to eliminate the single N-linked glycosylation site of DAF and of a chimeric receptor protein in which the O-glycosylated domain of DAF was replaced by a region of the HLA-B44 molecule, a role in EV70 binding for the sialic acid residues of DAF was excluded, suggesting the existence of at least one additional, sialylated EV70-binding factor at the cell surface. Treatment of cells with metabolic inhibitors of glycosylation excluded a role for the N-linked oligosaccharides of glycoproteins but suggested that O-linked glycosylation is important for EV70 binding.","Alexander, David A; Dimock, Kenneth",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12388686/,597

Therefore, the induction of mucosal immunity is a high priority in the development of vaccines against mucosal pathogens. The selection of an appropriate antigen delivery system is necessary to induce an efficient mucosal immune response. Poxvirus vectors have been the most intensively studied live recombinant vector, and numerous studies have demonstrated their ability to induce mucosal immune responses against foreign expressed antigens. Previous studies have demonstrated that recombinants based on the attenuated modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) vector were effective in inducing protective responses against different respiratory viruses, such as influenza and respiratory syncytial virus, following immunization via mucosal routes. Recent studies performed in the murine and macaque models have shown that recombinant MVA (rMVA) does not only stimulate HIV-specific immunity in the genital and rectal tracts following mucosal delivery, but can also control simian/human immunodeficiency viraemia and disease progression. In addition, a prime-boost vaccination approach against tuberculosis emphasized the importance of the intranasal rMVA antigen delivery to induce protective immunity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The aim of this review is to summarize the studies employing recombinant poxviruses, specifically rMVA as a mucosal delivery vector. The results demonstrate that rMVAs can activate specific immune responses at mucosal surfaces, and encourage further studies to characterize and improve the MVA mucosal immunogenicity of poxvirus vectors.","Gherardi, M Magdalena; Esteban, Mariano",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16227213/,597

METHODS Bioinformatics analyses were performed to search the homologous proteins of the SARS-CoV 3CL proteinase from the GenBank and PDB database. A 3D model of the proteinase was constructed by using homology modeling technique. Targeting to the 3D model and its X-ray crystal structure of the main proteinase (Mpro) of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), virtual screening was performed employing molecular docking method to identify possible 3CL proteinase inhibitors from small molecular databases. RESULTS Sequence alignment indicated that the SARS-CoV 3CL proteinase was extremely homologous to TGEV Mpro, especially the substrate-binding pocket (active site). Accordingly, a 3D model for the SARS-CoV 3CL proteinase was constructed based on the crystal structure of TGEV Mpro. The 3D model adopts a similar fold of the TGEV Mpro, its structure and binding pocket feature are almost as same as that of TGEV Mpro. The tested virtual screening indicated that 73 available proteinase inhibitors in the MDDR database might dock into both the binding pockets of the TGEV Mpro and the SARS-CoV 3CL proteinase. CONCLUSIONS Either the 3D model of the SARS-CoV 3CL proteinase or the X-ray crystal structure of the TGEV Mpro may be used as a starting point for design anti-SARS drugs.

The wide variety of affected organs is likely based upon the shared expression of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) important entry-receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). For this reason, the broad distribution of ACE2 receptors in different tissues plays a crucial role in the multi-organ dysfunction and fatality due to COVID-19. Because of the high prevalence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with COVID-19, we review the molecular understanding into viral infection mechanisms and implications for AKI. Furthermore, mechanisms of the AKI to chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression, such as the relative contribution of immune cell reaction, fibroblasts activation, endothelial dysfunction, and subsequent hypoxia may contribute to the association of AKI with worse outcomes during this virus pandemic. We highlight the state of the knowledge on SARS-CoV-2-dependent mechanisms for AKI and list the potential management choices for the prevention of AKI aggravation and the impending possibility of CKD. Finally, we intend to provide a much better understanding of why Coronavirus induces AKI and its subsequent progression to CKD in the coming years and further discuss the acute and long-term renal consequences.","Karimi, Zeinab; Masjedi, Fatemeh; Malekmakan, Leila; Doostkam, Aida; Roozbeh, Jamshid; Ghahramani, Nasrollah",Iranian journal of kidney diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34278995/,597

Adenovirus is one of the major viral causes of childhood bronchiolitis. As the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the most sensitive technique for documenting viral respiratory infections, the PCR method was performed on the throat swab samples of asthmatic children with and without wheezing to investigate the presence of the adenovirus genome in the upper respiratory tract. The frequencies of adenovirus in asymptomatic and symptomatic asthmatic patients, healthy controls and wheezy children were as follows: 33.3%, 71.4%, 37% and 62.96%, respectively. The adenovirus was detected in a significantly higher percentage in the upper airways of patients with asthma exacerbation and in children with wheezing than in patients without asthma exacerbation and in the healthy controls (p < 0.05). The frequency of adenovirus was not different between asthmatic patients receiving or not receiving inhaled corticosteroid. Adenovirus has the potential to precipitate asthma exacerbations in asthmatic patients; its frequency was not affected by the treatment of inhaled corticosteroid.","Saçkesen, Cansin; Pinar, Ahmet; Sekerel, Bülent E; Akyön, Yakut; Saraçlar, Yildiz",The Turkish journal of pediatrics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16250306/,597

We have previously determined the minimal mechanism of helicase function by nsp13 where we demonstrated that the enzyme unwinds nucleic acid in discrete steps of 9.3 base—pairs each with a catalytic rate of 30 steps per second. In that study we used different constructs of nsp13 (GST and H6 constructs). GST—nsp13 showed much more efficient nucleic acid unwinding than the H6—tagged counterpart. At 0.1 second, more than 50% of the ATP is hydrolyzed by GST—nsp13 compared to less than 5% ATP hydrolysis by H6—nsp13. Interestingly, the two constructs have the same binding affinity for nucleic acids. We, therefore propose that the difference in the catalytic efficiency of these two constructs is due to the interference of ATP binding by the histidine tag at the amino—terminus of nsp13.","Adedeji, A O; Singh, K; Sarafianos, S G",Cellular and molecular biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23273200/,597

High TVs may increase the incidence of postoperative lung injury after thoracic surgery. There is nonetheless little evidence that the use of low TV during OLV will fail to provide adequate arterial oxygenation. We evaluated the influence of low (5 mL/kg-1) and high (10 mL/kg-1) TV on arterial oxygenation during one-lung ventilation in clinical conditions. METHODS A hundred patients scheduled for lung surgery were studied. Patients were randomly assigned to either 30 minutes of one-lung ventilation with a TV of 10 mL/kg-1 at a rate of 10 breaths/minute (Group 10, N.=50) or a TV of 5 mL/kg-1 with 5 cmH2O PEEP at a rate of 20 breaths/minute (Group 5, N.=50). According to the rules of crossover design during the subsequent 30 minutes, each patient received the alternative management. Arterial blood partial pressures, hemodynamic responses, and ventilatory parameters were recorded. Results are presented as means ± SDs; P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS PaO2 was unaffected by TV (10 mL/kg-1: 218±106 versus 5 mL/kg-1: 211±119 mmHg, P=0.29). Calculated intrapulmonary shunt fraction was also similar with each TV during OLV (5 mL/kg-1: 25±9% versus 10 mL/kg-1: 24±8%, p=0.14). In contrast, low TV significantly increased PaCO2 (10 mL/kg-1: 39±6 versus 5 mL/kg-1: 44±8 mmHg, P<0.001). There were significant differences both in peak (10 mL/kg-1: 27±6 versus 5 mL/kg-1: 21±5 cmH2O, P<0.001) and plateau airway pressure values (10 mL/kg-1: 22±6 versus 5 mL/kg-1: 18±5 cmH2O, P<0.001) during OLV. CONCLUSION Low TV (5 mL/kg-1) accompanied by 5 cmH2O PEEP provides comparable arterial oxygenation and intrapulmonary shunt fraction during one-lung ventilation as higher TV (10 mL/kg-1) without PEEP.","Végh, T; Juhász, M; Szatmári, S; Enyedi, A; Sessler, D I; Szegedi, L L; Fülesdi, B",Minerva anestesiologica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23135690/,597

DESIGN Cross-sectional self-administered survey conducted between February 11 and March 10, 2004. SETTING The City of Ottawa, Ont, and the Department of Family Medicine at the University of Ottawa. PARTICIPANTS Ottawa family physicians; respondents can be considered a self-selected sample. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Self-reported office preparedness and physicians' capacity and willingness to respond to public health emergencies. RESULTS Response rate was 41%. Of 676 physicians contacted, 274 responded, and of those, 246 completed surveys. About 26% of respondents felt prepared for an outbreak of influenza not well covered by vaccine. About 18% felt prepared for serious respiratory epidemics, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome; about 50% felt unprepared. Most respondents (80%) thought they were not ready to respond to an earthquake. About 77% of physicians were willing to be contacted on an urgent basis in case of a public health emergency. Of these, 94% would assist in immunization clinics, 84% in antibiotic clinics, 58% in assessment centres, 52% in treatment centres, 41% with declaration of death, 26% with home care, and 23% with telephone counseling. CONCLUSION Family physicians appear to be unprepared for, but willing to address, serious public health emergencies. It is essential to set up effective partnerships between primary care and public health services to support family physicians' capacity to respond to emergencies. This type of study, along with the creation of a register of available services and of a virtual network for sharing information, is an initial step in assessing primary care response.","Hogg, William; Huston, Patricia; Martin, Carmel; Soto, Enrique",Canadian family physician Medecin de famille canadien,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17279185/,597

200580,"Reply: Thymopoiesis, inflamm-aging, and COVID-19 phenotype",2020,"Many classes of pathogens excreted in feces are able to initiate waterborne infections. There are bacterial pathogens, including enteric and aquatic bacteria, enteric viruses, and enteric protozoa, which are strongly resistant in the water environment and to most disinfectants. The infection dose of viral and protozoan agents is lower than bacteria, in the range of one to ten infectious units or oocysts. Waterborne outbreaks of bacterial origin (particularly typhoid fever) in the developing countries have declined dramatically from 1900s. Therefore, some early bacterial agents such as Shigella sonnei remains prevalent and new pathogens of fecal origin such as zoonotic C. jejuni and E. coli O157:H7 may contaminate pristine waters through wildlife or domestic animal feces. The common feature of these bacteria is the low inoculum (a few hundred cells) that may trigger disease. The emergence in early 1992 of serotype O139 of V. cholerae with epidemic potential in Southeast Asia suggests that other serotypes than V. cholerae O1 could also getting on epidemic. Some new pathogens include environmental bacteria that are capable of surviving and proliferating in water distribution systems. Other than specific hosts at risk, the general population is refractory to infection with ingested P. aeruginosa. The significance of Aeromonas spp. in drinking water to the occurrence of acute gastroenteritis remains a debatable point and has to be evaluated in further epidemiological studies. Legionella and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) are environmental pathogens that have found an ecologic niche in drinking and hot water supplies. Numerous studies have reported Legionnaires' disease caused by L. pneumophila occurring in residential and hospital water supplies. M. avium complex frequently causes disseminated infections in AIDS patients and drinking water has been suggested as a source of infection; in some cases the relationship has been proven. More and more numerous reports show that Helicobacter pylori DNA can be amplified from feces samples of infected patients, which strongly suggests fecal-to-oral transmission. Therefore, it is possible that H. pylori infection is waterbome, but these assumptions need to be substantiated. Giardiasis has become the most common cause of human waterborne disease in the U.S. over the last 30 years. However, as a result of the massive outbreak of waterborne cryptosporidiosis in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, affecting an estimated 403,000 persons, there is increasing interest in the epidemiology and prevention of new infection disease caused by Cryptosporidium spp. as well as monitoring water quality. The transmission of Cryptosporidium and Giardia through treated water supplies that meet water quality standards demonstrates that water treatment technologies have become inadequate, and that a negative coliform no longer guarantees that water is free from all pathogens, especially from protozoan agents. Substantial concern persists that low levels of pathogen occurrence may be responsible for the endemic transmission of enteric disease. In addition to Giardia and Cryptosporidium, some species of genera Cyclospora, Isospora, and of family Microsporidia are emerging as opportunistic pathogens and may have waterborne routes of transmission. More than 15 different groups of viruses, encompassing more than 140 distinct types can be found in the human gut. Some cause illness unrelated with the gut epithelium, such as Hepatitis A virus (HAV) and Hepatitis E virus (HEV). Numerous large outbreaks have been documented in the U.S. between 1950 and 1970, and the incidence rate has strongly declined in developing countries since the 1970s. Hepatitis E is mostly confined to tropical and subtropical areas, but recent reports indicate that it can occur at a low level in Europe. A relatively small group of viruses have been incriminated as causes of acute gastroenteritis in humans and fewer have proven to be true etiologic agents, including rotavirus, calicivirus, astrovirus, and some enteric adenovirus. These enteric viruses have infrequently been identified as the etiologic agents of waterborne disease outbreaks, because of inadequate diagnostic technology, but many outbreaks of unknown etiology currently reported are likely due to viral agents. Actually, Norwalk virus and Norwalk-like viruses are recognized as the major causes of waterborne illnesses world-wide. The global burden of infectious waterborne disease is considerable. Reported numbers highly underestimate the real incidence of waterborne diseases. The most striking concern is that enteric viruses such as caliciviruses and some protozoan agents, such as Cryptosporidium, are the best candidates to reach the highest levels of endemic transmission, because they are ubiquitous in water intended for drinking, being highly resistant to relevant environmental factors, including chemical disinfecting procedures. Other concluding concerns are the enhanced risks for the classic group of debilitated subjects (very young, old, pregnant, and immunocompromised individuals) and the basic requirement of to take specific measures aimed at reducing the risk of waterborne infection diseases in this growing, weaker population.","Leclerc, H; Schwartzbrod, L; Dei-Cas, E",Critical reviews in microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12546197/,597

A 582-base pair cDNA probe for viral RNA encoding the nucleocapsid protein of SIV type A H1N1 strain was generated by the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry gave similar results for serial sections from each of 15 lung samples. Positive cells typically exhibited a dark brown (in situ hybridization) or red (immunohistochemistry) reaction product in the nucleus and cytoplasm without background staining. A strong positive signal for both in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry was detected mainly in the bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial cells. A less intense signal was detected in the interstitial and alveolar macrophages. Simultaneous detection of hybridization and immunohistochemical signals on serial sections provided evidence that SIV had replicated in positive cells. The in situ hybridization technique developed in this study was useful for the detection of SIV RNA in tissues taken from naturally infected pigs and may be a valuable technique for studying the pathogenesis of SIV infection.,"Jung, T; Choi, C; Chae, C",Veterinary pathology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12102201/,597

202837,Community Pharmacy Practice in Nepal- An Underexploited Healthcare Domain,2019,"Despite growing interest in issues of residential mobility and place attachment in a globalised world, research within Environmental and Community psychology has tended to overlook the ways that interpersonal relations, and wider socio‐political and economic structural factors inform place attachment formation amongst residentially mobile individuals. We address this gap drawing on the Human Geography concept of ‘Linked Lives’ (Coulter et al., Progress in Human Geography, 2016, 40(3), 352–374), to conceive the relocation decisions of residentially mobile individuals, and their place (non)attachment to the current residence place, as deeply intertwined with formative place experiences, interpersonal relations, and the structural contexts within which people live (Coulter et al., Progress in Human Geography, 2016, 40(3), 352–374). With the aim of deepening understanding of the co‐evolution of residential mobility and place attachment, this paper presents narrative case studies of residents living in a town in Southwest England, with each resident indicating a different variety of people–place relations to their current residence place. Findings indicate that moving intentions and consequent residential place attachment result from complex interactions over time between (a) formative place experiences and settlement identities, leading to preferred types of residence place;(b) interpersonal relations with significant others including family and community members that vary according to life stage events;and (c) structural forces, comprising cultural, economic, and political factors shaping people's lives. Future research could examine how structural changes arising from the COVID‐19 pandemic are influencing residential mobilities and attachments to place.

First identified in December 2019, in March 2020 it was announced by the World Health Organisation that COVID-19 had become a global pandemic. The disease can affect different organ systems, and early reports have suggested skin symptoms. The researchers, working with dermatologists across Spain, reviewed 375 patients with suspected, or confirmed, COVID-19, with the aim of developing a detailed classification of the different types of skin symptoms associated with COVID-19 with corresponding images. An initial 120 images were reviewed by four dermatologists, without knowing any other clinical information, and they identified patterns of symptoms associated with COVID-19. These patterns were then applied to the rest of the images and further refined. Five common skin symptoms were identified this way. These symptoms are chilblain-like lesions, outbreaks of small blisters, wheals, rashes comprised of small flat and raised red bumps, and livedo and necrosis. Livedo is a skin condition where circulation is impaired within the blood vessels of the skin, necrosis refers to the premature death of skin tissue. These symptoms are associated with different severity of COVID-19 infection, from less severe disease in the chilblain-like lesions, to most severe in patients with livedo. The researchers noted that some of the skin symptoms associated with COVID-19 are common and can have many causes, particularly wheals and rashes. As such, they may not be particularly helpful as an aide to diagnosis.",,Br J Dermatol,,597

203230,Survey of the Impact of COVID-19 on Pediatric Orthopaedic Surgeons Globally,2021,"The response of the scientific community to the global health emergency caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has produced an unprecedented number of manuscripts in a short period of time, the vast majority of which have been shared in the form of preprints posted on online preprint repositories before peer review This surge in preprint publications has in itself attracted considerable attention, although mostly in the bibliometrics literature In the present study we apply a mathematical growth model, known as the generalized Richards model, to describe the time evolution of the cumulative number of COVID-19 related preprints This mathematical approach allows us to infer several important aspects concerning the underlying growth dynamics, such as its current stage and its possible evolution in the near future We also analyze the rank-frequency distribution of preprints servers, ordered by the number of COVID-19 preprints they host, and find that it follows a power law in the low rank (high frequency) region, with the high rank (low frequency) tail being better described by a q-exponential function The Zipf-like law in the high frequency regime indicates the presence of a cumulative advantage effect, whereby servers that already have more preprints receive more submissions © Copyright © 2021 Vasconcelos, Cordeiro, Duarte-Filho and Brum","Vasconcelos, G.

Analysis of China's recent Government Work Report suggests that while a repeat of recovery measures focused on high-emissions infrastructure following the 2008 global recession is not in the cards, a Chinese Green New Deal is not in sight either. Much investment is flowing to fossil fuel industries, whilst support policies for renewable energy industries are absent from Beijing's recovery program. These signs of environmental ambition taking a back seat are worrisome given that Beijing is currently designing its 14th Five-Year Plan.","Gosens, Jorrit; Jotzo, Frank",Environmental Innovation and Societal Transitions,,597

Los equipos de protección personal (EPP) tienen como indicación un único uso, sin embargo, la escasez de estos ha llevado a buscar métodos para descontaminarlos y reutilizarlos, asegurando su disponibilidad. La evidencia presenta múltiples procedimientos para descontaminar mascarillas con filtro respirador tipo N95 (MFR N95), pero el método ideal debe inactivar al patógeno, asegurar la integridad del filtro respirador, el ajuste de la mascarilla y la salud del personal que la utilizará. La descontaminación con peróxido de hidrógeno vaporizado, irradiación germicida ultravioleta e incubación con calor húmedo se presentan como los métodos más eficaces contra distintos patógenos. Ante la creciente demanda de EPP y MFR N95, se sugiere realizar más estudios clínicos, que evalúen la eficacia de los métodos de descontaminación específicamente contra SARS-CoV-2 y se generen protocolos que permitan reutilizar con total seguridad este vital elemento para el personal de salud.","Santos-López, Matías; Jaque-Ulloa, Diego; Serrano-Aliste, Sebastián",Int. j. odontostomatol.

204008,Home Birth in the Era of COVID-19: Counseling and Preparation for Pregnant Persons Living with HIV,2020,"Nowadays, humanity is facing one of the most dangerous pandemics known as COVID-19. Due to its high inter-person contagiousness, COVID-19 is rapidly spreading across the world. Positive patients are often suffering from different symptoms that can vary from mild to severe including cough, fever, sore throat, and body aches. In more dire cases, infected patients can experience severe symptoms that can cause breathing difficulties which lead to stern organ failure and die. The medical corps all over the world are overloaded because of the exponentially myriad number of contagions. Therefore, screening for the disease becomes overwrought with the limited tools of test. Additionally, test results may take a long time to acquire, leaving behind a higher potential for the prevalence of the virus among other individuals by the patients. To reduce the chances of infection, we suggest a prediction model that distinguishes the infected COVID-19 cases based on clinical symptoms and features. This model can be helpful for citizens to catch their infection without the need for visiting the hospital. Also, it helps the medical staff in triaging patients in case of a deficiency of medical amenities. In this paper, we use the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) to select the interesting features by finding the best trade-offs between two conflicting objectives: minimizing the number of features and maximizing the weights of selected features. Then, a classification phase is conducted using an AdaBoost classifier. The proposed model is evaluated using two different datasets. To maximize results, we performed a natural selection of hyper-parameters of the classifier using the genetic algorithm. The obtained results prove the efficiency of NSGA-II as a feature selection algorithm combined with AdaBoost classifier. It exhibits higher classification results that outperformed the existing methods.","Soui, Makram; Mansouri, Nesrine; Alhamad, Raed; Kessentini, Marouane; Ghedira, Khaled",Nonlinear Dyn,,597
204072,COVID-19: Considerations for Children and Families During the Pandemic,2020,"A survey of undergraduate students 18–25 years of age (n = 777) was conducted at a large U.S. University to assess changes in alcohol consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic and associations with anxiety and depression symptom severity assessed via the GAD-7 and PHQ-9, respectively. Fifty-three percent experienced anxiety, 57% experienced depression, and 46% experienced both in the past two weeks in fall 2020. Alcohol consumption increased 54% from February to October 2020 (p &lt; .01), most pronouncedly in students with severe anxiety (86%), severe depression (180%), or both (83%). Depression severity was associated with the largest increases in alcohol consumption during COVID-19 in students.

204953,ACE2 and COVID-19: using antihypertensive medications and pharmacogenetic considerations,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) initiates the cytokine/chemokine storm-mediated lung injury. The SARS-CoV unique domain (SUD) with three macrodomains (N, M, and C), showing the G-quadruplex binding activity, was examined the possible role in SARS pathogenesis in this study. The chemokine profile analysis indicated that SARS-CoV SUD significantly up-regulated the expression of CXCL10, CCL5 and interleukin (IL)-1ß in human lung epithelial cells and in the lung tissues of the mice intratracheally instilled with the recombinant plasmids. Among the SUD subdomains, SUD-MC substantially activated AP-1-mediated CXCL10 expression in vitro. In the wild type mice, SARS-CoV SUD-MC triggered the pulmonary infiltration of macrophages and monocytes, inducing CXCL10-mediated inflammatory responses and severe diffuse alveolar damage symptoms. Moreover, SUD-MC actuated NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome-dependent pulmonary inflammation, as confirmed by the NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor and the NLRP3-/- mouse model. This study demonstrated that SARS-CoV SUD modulated NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent CXCL10-mediated pulmonary inflammation, providing the potential therapeutic targets for developing the antiviral agents.","Chang, Young-Sheng; Ko, Bo-Han; Ju, Jyh-Cherng; Chang, Hsin-Hou; Huang, Su-Hua; Lin, Cheng-Wen",,,597

207391,COVID-19 and implications for thiopurine use,2020,"The rapid evolution of RNA viruses has been long considered to result from a combination of high copying error frequencies during RNA replication, short generation times and the consequent extensive fixation of neutral or adaptive changes over short periods. While both the identities and sites of mutations are typically modelled as being random, recent investigations of sequence diversity of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have identified a preponderance of C->U transitions, proposed to be driven by an APOBEC-like RNA editing process. The current study investigated whether this phenomenon could be observed in datasets of other RNA viruses. Using a 5% divergence filter to infer directionality, 18 from 36 datasets of aligned coding region sequences from a diverse range of mammalian RNA viruses (including Picornaviridae, Flaviviridae, Matonaviridae, Caliciviridae and Coronaviridae) showed a >2-fold base composition normalised excess of C->U transitions compared to U->C (range 2.1x-7.5x), with a consistently observed favoured 5' U upstream context. The presence of genome scale RNA secondary structure (GORS) was the only other genomic or structural parameter significantly associated with C->U/U->C transition asymmetries by multivariable analysis (ANOVA), potentially reflecting RNA structure dependence of sites targeted for C->U mutations. Using the association index metric, C->U changes were specifically over-represented at phylogenetically uninformative sites, potentially paralleling extensive homoplasy of this transition reported in SARS-CoV-2. Although mechanisms remain to be functionally characterised, excess C->U substitutions accounted for 11-14% of standing sequence variability of structured viruses and may therefore represent a potent driver of their sequence diversification and longer-term evolution.","Simmonds, Peter; Ansari, M Azim",PLoS Pathog,,597
207428,[A Case of Suicide Related with COVID-19],2020,"The use of trolleys in the shopping industry has always been very popular, especially among customers who frequently stop by the mall or supermarket to shop for their necessities.

207665,Evaluation of remote monitoring device for monitoring vital parameters against reference standard: A diagnostic validation study for COVID-19 preparedness,2020,"Simulation is capable to cope with the uncertain and dynamic nature of industrial value chains. However, in-depth system expertise is inevitable for mapping objects and constraints from the real world to a virtual model. This knowledge-intensity leads to long development times of respective projects, which contradicts the need for timely decision support. Since more and more companies use industrial knowledge graphs and ontologies to foster their knowledge management, this paper proposes a framework on how to efficiently derive a simulation model from such semantic knowledge bases. As part of the approach, a novel Simulation Ontology provides a standardized meta-model for hybrid simulations. Its instantiation enables the user to come up with a fully parameterized formal simulation model. Newly developed Mapping Rules facilitate this process by providing guidance on how to turn knowledge from existing ontologies, which describe the system to be simulated, into instances of the Simulation Ontology. The framework is completed by a parsing procedure for an automated transformation of this conceptual model into an executable one. This novel modeling approach makes model development more efficient by reducing its complexity. It is validated in a use case implementation from semiconductor manufacturing, where cross-domain knowledge was required in order to model and simulate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on a global supply chain network.","Jurasky, Wiking Moder Patrick Milde Michael Ehm Hans Reinhart Gunther",Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing,,597

The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical manifestations and CT features of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia in 15 pregnant women and to provide some initial evidence that can be used for guiding treatment of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS. We reviewed the clinical data and CT examinations of 15 consecutive pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia in our hospital from January 20, 2020, to February 10, 2020. A semiquantitative CT scoring system was used to estimate pulmonary involvement and the time course of changes on chest CT. Symptoms and laboratory results were analyzed, treatment experiences were summarized, and clinical outcomes were tracked. RESULTS. Eleven patients had successful delivery (10 cesarean deliveries and one vaginal delivery) during the study period, and four patients were still pregnant (three in the second trimester and one in the third trimester) at the end of the study period. No cases of neonatal asphyxia, neonatal death, stillbirth, or abortion were reported. The most common early finding on chest CT was ground-glass opacity (GGO). With disease progression, crazy paving pattern and consolidations were seen on CT. The abnormalities showed absorptive changes at the end of the study period for all patients. The most common onset symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were fever (13/15 patients) and cough (9/15 patients). The most common abnormal laboratory finding was lymphocytopenia (12/15 patients). CT images obtained before and after delivery showed no signs of pneumonia aggravation after delivery. The four patients who were still pregnant at the end of the study period were not treated with antiviral drugs but had achieved good recovery. CONCLUSION. Pregnancy and childbirth did not aggravate the course of symptoms or CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia. All the cases of COVID-19 pneumonia in the pregnant women in our study were the mild type. All the women in this study-some of whom did not receive antiviral drugs-achieved good recovery from COVID-19 pneumonia.","Liu, Dehan; Li, Lin; Wu, Xin; Zheng, Dandan; Wang, Jiazheng; Yang, Lian; Zheng, Chuansheng",AJR Am J Roentgenol,,597

The titer change of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 needs to be further clarified, the clinical and preventive value of antibodies still needs to be further investigated. METHOD: An ELISA was established by coating with SARS-CoV-2 recombinant spike protein and used to detect serum IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients to evaluate the pattern of changes of antibodies. RESULTS: The specificity of the ELISA for detection SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG were 96% (144/150) and 100% (150/150), respectively. The sensitivity of ELISA was 100% (150/150) for IgM, and 99.3% (149/150) for IgG. SARS-CoV-2-SP-IgM and SP-IgG antibodies could be detected on day 1 of hospitalization in 12.5% patients, and SP-IgM began to decrease after reaching its peak at around 22-28 days, and become negative at month 3 in 30% patients and negative at month 7 in 79% of these patients after onset; IgG reached its peak around day 22-28 and kept at a high level within the longest observation period for 4 months, it dropped very sharply at 7 months. The positive rates of SP-IgM and SP-IgG were higher than those of RT-qPCR on day 7 and 4. CONCLUSION: The established indirect ELISA has good specificity and sensitivity. IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 appeared almost simultaneously in the early stage, and the level of IgG antibodies couldn't maintain a high plateau in the observation period of 7 months.

208502,Institutional versus home isolation to curb the COVID-19 outbreak,2020,"Introduction La vaccination contre le SARS-CoV-2 représente un espoir dans la lutte contre la pandémie actuelle. Les efforts internationaux de développement et d’approbation de plusieurs vaccins ont conduit au démarrage des campagnes de vaccination moins d’un an après l’émergence de cette pandémie. Les vaccins les plus efficaces montrent une efficacité&gt;90 % et un excellent profil de tolérance. Les patients atteints d’un cancer actif présentent un risque accru de forme sévère de COVID-19 et devraient être par conséquence une population cible pour la vaccination. L’objectif de ce travail est de développer et de valider un nomogramme afin de prédire l’acceptabilité de la vaccination contre le SARS-CoV-2 chez des patients atteints de cancer. Méthodes Une enquête de cohorte a été menée dans quatre centres de cancérologie des Alpes-Maritimes entre novembre et décembre 2020. Les patients inclus étaient âgés de plus de 18 ans et traités pour un cancer par chimiothérapie ou radiothérapie ;sous hormonothérapie, ou étaient en surveillance de leur cancer. Un auto-questionnaire anonyme sur les déterminants de la future vaccination anti-COVID-19 a été administré à chaque patient. La cohorte a été séparée en deux cohortes distinctes : une cohorte d’apprentissage pour développer le modèle et une cohorte pour le valider. Les variables statistiquement significatives lors de l’analyse univariée (p&lt;0,05) ont été introduites dans un modèle de régression logistique en suivant une procédure de sélection des variables de type pas à pas descendant utilisant le critère AIC. À partir du modèle multivarié final, un nomogramme a été développé afin de prédire l’acceptabilité des patients vis-à-vis de la vaccination contre le SARS-CoV-2. Toutes les analyses ont été réalisées à l’aide du logiciel R et du package DynNom pour la représentation graphique du nomogramme. Résultats Parmi les 1244 questionnaires administrés, 999 questionnaires ont été analysés (80,3 %). La population comprenait 56,1 % de femmes et l’âge médian était de 67 ans (extrêmes : 18–97). Parmi ces patients, 47 % étaient sous traitement actif (chimiothérapie, immunothérapie, radiothérapie), 40 % étaient sous surveillance et 13 % étaient sous hormonothérapie. La majorité avait reçu un vaccin contre la grippe en 2020 (54,3 %) ou les années précédentes (52,2 %). Une faible proportion des patients a affirmé avoir contracté la COVID-19 (2,8 %) et plus de 50 % des patients ont déclaré l’intention de vouloir se faire vacciner. Le sexe, l’âge et l’antécédent de vaccination contre la grippe ont été identifiés comme des facteurs indépendants significatifs prédictifs de la volonté de se faire vacciner contre le SARS-CoV-2 et ont été utilisés dans la construction du nomogramme. Avec une accuracy de 0,68 [IC95 % : 0,62–0,73], une sensibilité de 0,73, une spécificité de 0,62 et une AUC égale à 0,7 [IC95 % : 0,6–0,8], la validité du modèle peut-être jugée comme satisfaisante.

The authors note that between March and May 2020, Japan experienced a lockdown due to the COVID-19 crisis. They hypothesize that the subsequently empty roads may have triggered speed-related traffic violations that caused fatal motor vehicle collisions (MVCs). In their study, the authors reviewed police data on crash fatalities between January 2010 and February 2020 in which motor vehicle drivers were at fault, then forecasted the numbers of fatal crashes that might be expected during the three-month lockdown period. The authors found that the actual, observed speed-related fatal crashes were within the 95% confidence intervals of the forecasted numbers. However, in April 2020, the observed ratio was higher than the forecasted ratio. The authors conclude with a brief discussion of the interplay between speeding, speed enforcement by the police, and driver behavior during a lockdown.","Inada, Haruhiko Ashraf Lamisa Campbell Sachalee",Injury Prevention,,597

In particular, more than 30 million Chinese college students are home-schooling, yet there is little understanding of how academic workload, separation from school, and fears of contagion lead to a decrease in their health. This study examined the relationships between Chinese college students' three critical stressors and two types of health in the COVID-19 pandemic context. We used a three-wave lagged design with a one-week interval. All the constructs were assessed by self-report in anonymous surveys during the COVID-19 pandemic. College students were asked to report their demographic information, academic workload, separation from school, fears of contagion, perceived stress, and health. The results of this study showed that academic workload, separation from school, and fears of contagion had negative effects on college students' health via perceived stress. In the COVID-19 crisis, multiple prevention and control measures focusing on college students may lead them to have different degrees of stress and health problems. Our results enrich the literature on stress and health and offer novel practical implications for all circles of the society to ensure students' health under the context of the COVID-19 epidemic.","Yang, Chunjiang; Chen, Aobo; Chen, Yashuo",PLoS One,,597

210321,Pipeline Pharmacological Therapies in Clinical Trial for COVID-19 Pandemic: a Recent Update,2020,"The events of the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemics have shown the importance of social factors, especially given the large number of asymptomatic cases that effectively spread the virus, which can cause a medical emergency to very susceptible individuals. Besides, the SARS-CoV-2 virus survives for several hours on different surfaces, where a new host can contract it with a delay. These passive modes of infection transmission remain an unexplored area for traditional mean-field epidemic models. Here, we design an agent-based model for simulations of infection transmission in an open system driven by the dynamics of social activity; the model takes into account the personal characteristics of individuals, as well as the survival time of the virus and its potential mutations. A growing bipartite graph embodies this biosocial process, consisting of active carriers (host) nodes that produce viral nodes during their infectious period. With its directed edges passing through viral nodes between two successive hosts, this graph contains complete information about the routes leading to each infected individual. We determine temporal fluctuations of the number of exposed and the number of infected individuals, the number of active carriers and active viruses at hourly resolution. The simulated processes underpin the latent infection transmissions, contributing significantly to the spread of the virus within a large time window. More precisely, being brought by social dynamics and exposed to the currently existing infection, an individual passes through the infectious state until eventually spontaneously recovers or otherwise is moves to a controlled hospital environment. Our results reveal complex feedback mechanisms that shape the dependence of the infection curve on the intensity of social dynamics and other sociobiological factors. In particular, the results show how the lockdown effectively reduces the spread of infection and how it increases again after the lockdown is removed. Furthermore, a reduced level of social activity but prolonged exposure of susceptible individuals have adverse effects. On the other hand, virus mutations that can gradually reduce the transmission rate by hopping to each new host along the infection path can significantly reduce the extent of the infection, but can not stop the spreading without additional social strategies. Our stochastic processes, based on graphs at the interface of biology and social dynamics, provide a new mathematical framework for simulations of various epidemic control strategies with high temporal resolution and virus traceability.","Tadic, Bosiljka; Melnik, Roderick",PLoS One,,597

However, few studies have focused on the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of pediatric COVID-19. This study conducted a retrospective review of the epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19 in children. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on children with a definite diagnosis of COVID-19 in mainland China using the web crawler technique to collect anonymous COVID-19 updates published by local health authorities. RESULTS: Three hundred forty-one children aged 4 days to 14 years with a median age of 7 years were included. Sixty-six percent of pediatric patients were infected via family members with COVID-19. The median incubation period was 9 days (interquartile range, 6 to 13). Asymptomatic cases accounted for 5.9%, of which 30% had abnormal chest radiologic findings. A majority of pediatric COVID-19 cases showed mild to moderate clinical features, and only a few developed severe or critical diseases (0.6% and 0.3%, respectively). Fever (77.9%) and cough (32.4%) were the predominant presenting symptoms of pediatric COVID-19. The pediatric patients had fewer underlying diseases and complications than adults. The treatment modalities for pediatric COVID-19 patients were not as complex as those of adult COVID-19 patients. The overall prognosis of pediatric COVID-19 was benign with a decent recovery. The median time from onset to cure was 16 days (interquartile range, 13 to 21). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to adults, COVID-19 in children has distinct features of epidemiology and clinical manifestations. The findings from this study might help to guide the development of measures to prevent and treat this ongoing global pandemic.

Currently there is no effective antiviral treatment for COVID-19. Thus, early recognition of patients at high risk is important. METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational study of 110 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. We compared the effectiveness of three scoring systems: the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS), quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA), and National Early Warning Score (NEWS) systems, for predicting the prognosis of COVID-19. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was used for these assessments, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to identify the cumulative risk for 28-day mortality according to the NEWS stratification. RESULTS: For predicting 28-day mortality, NEWS was superior to qSOFA (AUROC, 0.867 vs. 0.779, P < 0.001), while there was no significant difference between NEWS and SIRS (AUROC, 0.867 vs. 0.639, P = 0.100). For predicting critical outcomes, NEWS was superior to both SIRS (AUROC, 0.918 vs. 0.744, P = 0.032) and qSOFA (AUROC, 0.918 vs. 0.760, P = 0.012). Survival time was significantly shorter for patients with NEWS &#8805; 7 than for patients with NEWS < 7. CONCLUSION: Calculation of the NEWS at the time of hospital admission can predict critical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Early intervention for high-risk patients can thereby improve clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients.","Jang, Jong Geol; Hur, Jian; Hong, Kyung Soo; Lee, Wonhwa; Ahn, June Hong",J Korean Med Sci,,597

OBJECTIVE: To objectively evaluate the effects of RPE including medical masks and respirators on the skin barrier by measuring various physiological properties of the skin. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was designed. Twenty healthy healthcare workers were included in this study. Skin parameters including skin hydration, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), erythema, sebum secretion, pH, and skin temperature were measured in the RPE-covered and RPE-uncovered areas of the face 4 and 8 hours after wearing RPE and 14 hours after not wearing RPE. RESULTS: Skin hydration, TEWL, erythema, pH, and skin temperature increased in the RPE-covered areas after wearing RPE for 4 and 8 hours. By contrast, in the RPE-uncovered areas, skin hydration decreased and TEWL, erythema, and pH showed minimal changes over time. Based on the repeated-measure analysis, the changes in skin physiological properties over time were significantly different between RPE-covered and RPE-uncovered areas. CONCLUSION: We observed that skin physiological characteristics change with the prolonged use of RPE such as medical masks and respirators. These changes may lead to various adverse skin reactions after long-term use.","Han, Hye Sung; Shin, Sun Hye; Park, Jae Wan; Li, Kapsok; Kim, Beom Joon; Yoo, Kwang Ho",Contact dermat,,597

213075,Speculation is not evidence: antihypertensive therapy and COVID-19,2020,"Motivation: Traditional image attribution methods struggle to satisfactorily explain predictions of neural networks. Prediction explanation is important, especially in the medical imaging, for avoiding the unintended consequences of deploying AI systems when false positive predictions can impact patient care. Thus, there is a pressing need to develop improved models for model explainability and introspection. Specific Problem: A new approach is to transform input images to increase or decrease features which cause the prediction. However, current approaches are difficult to implement as they are monolithic or rely on GANs. These hurdles prevent wide adoption. Our approach: Given an arbitrary classifier, we propose a simple autoencoder and gradient update (Latent Shift) that can transform the latent representation of an input image to exaggerate or curtail the features used for prediction. We use this method to study chest X-ray classifiers and evaluate their performance. We conduct a reader study with two radiologists assessing 240 chest X-ray predictions to identify which ones are false positives (half are) using traditional attribution maps or our proposed method. Results: We found low overlap with ground truth pathology masks for models with reasonably high accuracy. However, the results from our reader study indicate that these models are generally looking at the correct features. We also found that the Latent Shift explanation allows a user to have more confidence in true positive predictions compared to traditional approaches (0.15$\pm$0.95 in a 5 point scale with p=0.01) with only a small increase in false positive predictions (0.04$\pm$1.06 with p=0.57).

Risk factors, histopathological characterization, pathophysiology, prevalence, and management of post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis are poorly understood, and few studies have addressed these issues.Areas covered:This article reviews the current evidence regarding post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis, with an emphasis on the potential risk factors, histopathology, pathophysiology, functional and tomographic features, and potential therapeutic modalities. A search on the issue was performed in the MEDLINE, Embase, and SciELO databases and the Cochrane library between 1 December 2019, and 25 January 2021. Studies were reviewed and relevant topics were incorporated into this narrative review. Expert opinion: Pulmonary sequelae may occur secondary to COVID-19, which needs to be included as a potential etiology in the current differential diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis. Therefore, serial clinical, tomographic, and functional screening for pulmonary fibrosis is recommended after COVID-19, mainly in patients with pulmonary involvement in the acute phase of the disease. Further studies are necessary to determine the risk factors, markers, pathophysiology, and appropriate management of post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis.","Tanni, Suzana Erico; Fabro, Alexandre Todorovic; de Albuquerque, André; Ferreira, Eloara Vieira Machado; Verrastro, Carlos Gustavo Yuji; Sawamura, Márcio Valente Yamada; Ribeiro, Sergio Marrone; Baldi, Bruno Guedes",Expert Rev Respir Med,,597

215019,Progression of Myopia in School-Aged Children After COVID-19 Home Confinement,2021,"Maritime piloting operations involve on-call work schedules that may lead to sleep loss and circadian misalignment. Our study documented pilot work scheduling practices (n = 61) over a one-year period. Most pilots worked a week-on/week-off schedule. Work periods averaged 7.6 hours in duration and pilots worked up to four ship assignments during a given work period. Work weeks averaged a total of 35.0 hours with pilots working on average three consecutive days. Night work was common (19.0 hours/week) with 02:00 h the most common starting hour for a work period. On-call work periods occurred at irregular times with a high degree of start time variability between consecutive work periods. While typical individual and weekly work total hours were not high, there were instances with long work periods, minimal rest opportunities, and extended total weekly work hours. Fatigue-model predictions based on work schedules were similar to objective outcomes collected among other groups of maritime pilots and may prove useful in identifying potential fatigue risks within on-call work schedules. Future studies should be conducted using objective measures to provide further insight on how on-call maritime operations influence sleep timing, alertness, and performance.","Gregory, Kevin; Hobbs, Alan; Parke, Bonny; Bathurst, Nicholas; Pradhan, Sean; Flynn-Evans, Erin",Chronobiol Int,,597
215046,Clinical characteristics of 11 asymptomatic patients with COVID-19,2020,"In patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the respiratory symptoms, such as fever, cough and dyspnea, are the most frequent clinical manifestations. These patients may also present with less well-defined symptoms like diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and/or abdominal discomfort both at the time of diagnosis and during the clinical course. In a few cases, these symptoms may also present before the appearance of respiratory symptoms. To penetrate the body, Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 uses ACE2 receptors, which are present not only in respiratory epithelium but also in gastrointestinal mucosa and liver cholangiocytes. In several cases, viral RNA is detectable in the stool of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The liver damage seems to show a multifactorial origin. About 2%-11% of patients with COVID-19 have known underlying hepatic pathologies. In 14%-53% of COVID-19 cases, there is an alteration of the indices of liver cytolysis and is more frequently observed in severe forms of COVID-19, especially during hospitalization.","Zippi, Maddalena; Fiorino, Sirio; Occhigrossi, Giuseppe; Hong, Wandong",World J.

The COVID-19 pandemic imposed an extreme case of lockdown in China and limited many Chinese's activities to what they could do in their homes. Understanding the public's motivations to use both mainstream media and social media can help better serve the public during a public health emergency. Based on an online survey of 528 participants, conducted in China in April 2020, the present investigation revealed that the participants had stronger information-seeking and surveillance motivations to use mainstream media than social media. There were small, nonsignificant differences between other motivations to use traditional media and social media (i.e., emotion management, expressive motivation, and social interaction/helping others motivation). Participants had stronger credibility-based attitudes toward traditional media than toward social media. Among these motivations, the information-seeking motivations to use mainstream media and social media were the strongest predictor of their respective attitudes toward mainstream media and social media. Further results show that both types of media use can be predicted by other motivations (e.g., social interaction and emotion management), instead of their attitudes toward the media, and can be mindless and habitual.","Wang, Xiao",Computers in Human Behavior Reports,,597

218506,Polydatin and COVID-19,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a significant growth in government surveillance techniques globally, primarily through the use of cell phone applications. However, although these applications can have actionable effects on public health efforts to control pandemics, the participatory or voluntary nature of these measures is obscuring the relationship between health information and traditional government surveillance techniques, potentially preventing effective oversight. Public health measures have traditionally been resistant to the integration of government-led intelligence techniques, such as signals intelligence (SIGINT), because of ethical and legal issues arising from the nature of surveillance techniques.We explore this rise of participatory SIGINT and its nature as an extension of biosurveillance through 3 drivers: the rise of surveillance capitalism, the exploitation of a public health crisis to obscure state of exception politics with a moral imperative, and the historically enduring nature of emergency-implemented surveillance measures.We conclude that although mobile applications may indeed be useful in containing pandemics, they should be subject to similar oversight and regulation as other government intelligence collection techniques.","Bernard, Rose; Bowsher, Gemma; Sullivan, Richard",Am J Public Health,,597

We report on an improved soluble ACE2, termed a ""microbody,"" in which the ACE2 ectodomain is fused to Fc domain 3 of the immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain. The protein is smaller than previously described ACE2-Ig Fc fusion proteins and contains an H345A mutation in the ACE2 catalytic active site that inactivates the enzyme without reducing its affinity for the SARS-CoV-2 spike. The disulfide-bonded ACE2 microbody protein inhibits entry of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudotyped virus and replication of live SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and in a mouse model. Its potency is 10-fold higher than soluble ACE2, and it can act after virus bound to the cell. The microbody inhibits the entry of ß coronaviruses and virus with the variant D614G spike. The ACE2 microbody may be a valuable therapeutic for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that is active against viral variants and future coronaviruses.","Tada, Takuya; Fan, Chen; Chen, Jennifer S; Kaur, Ramanjit; Stapleford, Kenneth A; Gristick, Harry; Dcosta, Belinda M; Wilen, Craig B; Nimigean, Crina M; Landau, Nathaniel R",Cell Rep,,597

219141,The Impact of COVID-19 on Children-Parent's Perspective,2020,"The Ni-Fe-S-containing A-cluster of acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) synthase (ACS) assembles acetyl-CoA from carbon monoxide (CO), a methyl group (CH3+), and CoA. To accomplish this feat, ACS must bind CoA and interact with two other proteins that contribute the CO and CH3+, respectively: CO dehydrogenase (CODH) and corrinoid Fe-S protein (CFeSP). Previous structural data show that, in the model acetogen Moorella thermoacetica, domain 1 of ACS binds to CODH such that a 70-Å-long internal channel is created that allows CO to travel from CODH to the A-cluster. The A-cluster is largely buried and is inaccessible to CFeSP for methylation. Here we use electron microscopy to capture multiple snapshots of ACS that reveal previously uncharacterized domain motion, forming extended and hyperextended structural states. In these structural states, the A-cluster is accessible for methylation by CFeSP.","Cohen, Steven E; Brignole, Edward J; Wittenborn, Elizabeth C; Can, Mehmet; Thompson, Samuel; Ragsdale, Stephen W; Drennan, Catherine L",,,597

The purpose of this study was to investigate 62 subjects in Wuhan, China, with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia and describe the CT features of this epidemic disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS. A retrospective study of 62 consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia was performed. CT images and clinical data were reviewed. Two thoracic radiologists evaluated the distribution and CT signs of the lesions and also scored the extent of involvement of the CT signs. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare lesion distribution and CT scores. The chi-square test was used to compare the CT signs of early-phase versus advanced-phase COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS. A total of 62 patients (39 men and 23 women; mean [± SD] age, 52.8 ± 12.2 years; range, 30-77 years) with COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated. Twenty-four of 30 patients who underwent routine blood tests (80.0%) had a decreased lymphocyte count. Of 27 patients who had their erythrocyte sedimentation rate and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level assessed, 18 (66.7%) had an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and all 27 (100.0%) had an elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level. Multiple lesions were seen on the initial CT scan of 52 of 62 patients (83.9%). Forty-eight of 62 patients (77.4%) had predominantly peripheral distribution of lesions. The mean CT score for the upper zone (3.0 ± 3.4) was significantly lower than that for the middle (4.5 ± 3.8) and lower (4.5 ± 3.7) zones (p = 0.022 and p = 0.020, respectively), and there was no significant difference in the mean CT score of the middle and lower zones (p = 1.00). The mean CT score for the anterior area (4.4 ± 4.1) was significantly lower than that for the posterior area (7.7 ± 6.3) (p = 0.003). CT findings for the patients were as follows: 25 patients (40.3%) had ground-glass opacities (GGO), 21 (33.9%), consolidation; 39 (62.9%), GGO plus a reticular pattern; 34 (54.8%), vacuolar sign; 28 (45.2%), microvascular dilation sign; 35 (56.5%), fibrotic streaks; 21 (33.9%), a subpleural line; and 33 (53.2%), a subpleural transparent line. With regard to bronchial changes seen on CT, 45 patients (72.6%) had air bronchogram, and 11 (17.7%) had bronchus distortion. In terms of pleural changes, CT showed that 30 patients (48.4%) had pleural thickening, 35 (56.5%) had pleural retraction sign, and six (9.7%) had pleural effusion. Compared with early-phase disease (&#8804; 7 days after the onset of symptoms), advanced-phase disease (8-14 days after the onset of symptoms) was characterized by significantly increased frequencies of GGO plus a reticular pattern, vacuolar sign, fibrotic streaks, a subpleural line, a subpleural transparent line, air bronchogram, bronchus distortion, and pleural effusion; however, GGO significantly decreased in advanced-phase disease. CONCLUSION. CT examination of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia showed a mixed and diverse pattern with both lung parenchyma and the interstitium involved. Identification of GGO and a single lesion on the initial CT scan suggested early-phase disease. CT signs of aggravation and repair coexisted in advanced-phase disease. Lesions presented with a characteristic multifocal distribution in the middle and lower lung regions and in the posterior lung area. A decreased lymphocyte count and an increased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level were the most common laboratory findings.","Zhou, Shuchang; Wang, Yujin; Zhu, Tingting; Xia, Liming",AJR Am J Roentgenol,,597

Immediate measures to reduce transmission rates and protect patients and providers take priority and necessitate some delays in care, particularly for patients with mild symptoms or less aggressive cancers. However, strict guidelines have yet to be developed, and many unintentional delays in care are to be expected based on the magnitude of the looming public health crisis. The medical complexity of head and neck cancer management may lead to prolonged delays that worsen treatment outcomes. Therefore, those caring for patients with head and neck cancer must take action to reduce these negative impacts as the country rallies to overcome the challenges posed by this pandemic.","Werner, Michael T; Carey, Ryan M; Albergotti, W Greer; Lukens, John N; Brody, Robert M",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,597
221129,Abnormal Effective Connectivity Underlying Auditory Mismatch Negativity Impairments in Schizophrenia,2020,"Many governments have implemented strict lockdown measures to prevent the transmission of the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Compliance with these restrictions is vital and depends greatly on the level of trust in the institutions central to their development and implementation. The objectives of this study were to assess: (1) the effects of the Dutch lockdown measures imposed in March 2020 on trust in government and trust in science; and (2) whether these differ across social groups. We draw on unique data from the high-quality Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences panel, which comprises a true probability sample of Dutch households (average participation rate: 80.4%). Our data were collected on an ongoing basis from December 2017 to March 2020 (n = 2219). Using the implementation of lockdown measures in mid-March as a natural experiment, we employed difference-in-differences analyses to assess the causal effect of the Dutch lockdown measures on trust in government and trust in science. We estimated that the imposition of the measures caused an 18% increase (95% confidence interval (CI):15%-21%)) in trust in government and a 6% increase (95% CI: 4%-8%) in trust in science. The impact on trust in government was greater among the participants aged 65 and older and those with poor self-assessed health, although the relevant CIs were wide and, in the case of self-assessed health, included the null. No differential effects were observed for trust in science. Our study indicates that the strict public-health measures imposed in the Netherlands during an acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic generated trust in the institutions involved in drafting and implementing them, especially among those with a higher risk of serious health outcomes. This suggests that, to prevent a major public-health crisis, people appreciate firm government intervention during the acute phase of an infectious disease pandemic.","Oude Groeniger, Joost; Noordzij, Kjell; van der Waal, Jeroen; de Koster, Willem",Soc Sci Med,,597

We used linear regression to model weekly consultation counts and blood pressure (BP) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) measurement counts per 100 patients and predicted non-shutdown values. Analyses were repeated for selected at-risk groups and different age groups. Results: During the shutdown, weekly consultation counts were lower than predicted by -17.2% (total population), -16.5% (patients with hypertension), -17.5% (diabetes), -17.6% (cardiovascular disease), -15.7% (patients aged &lt;60 years), -20.4% (60-80 years), and -14.5% (&gt;80 years). Weekly BP counts were reduced by -35.3% (total population) and -35.0% (hypertension), and HbA1c counts by -33.2% (total population) and -29.8% (diabetes). p-values Conclusion: Our results document consequential decreases in consultation counts and chronic disease monitoring during the shutdown.

We compared the sensitivity and specificity of the two rapid antigen tests against RT-PCR results in 130 symptomatic and 130 asymptomatic adults. In addition, we evaluated the suitability and ease-of-use of the BD Veritor test in a subsample of study participants (n=42) and implementers (n=5). The sensitivity of the BD Veritor rapid antigen test was 70% in symptomatic (95% confidence interval [CI]: 51-85%) and 87% (95% CI: 69-96%) in asymptomatic individuals with positive SARSCoV-2 RT-PCR, for overall sensitivity of 78% (95% CI: 66-88%). The sensitivity of the Standard Q rapid antigen test was 63% (95% CI: 44-80%) in symptomatic and 73% (95% CI: 54-87%) in asymptomatic individuals. One false positive in BD Veritor test (specificity 99.5) and no false positive in Standard Q tests were observed (specificity 100%). The BD Veritor rapid antigen test was 78% sensitive when compared with RT-PCR irrespective of the cycle threshold (Ct) levels in this evaluation in Bangladesh.

Our study aimed to evaluate the performance of the immunochromatographic AMP rapid antigen test (AMP RAT) compared to the gold-standard real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) in a hospital cohort. METHODS: A total of 392 patients, who presented consecutively with COVID-19 symptoms in our emergency department, were included in this retrospective study. Two swabs were collected per patient: a nasopharyngeal for the RAT and a combined naso- and oropharyngeal for the rRT-PCR. A positive rRT-PCR (defined as cycle threshold (Ct) < 40) was found in 94 (24%) patients. RESULTS: In our cohort with a median patient age of 70, overall sensitivity and specificity of the AMP RAT was 69.2% (58.8-78.3, 95% CI) and 99.7% (98.1-100.0, 95% CI), respectively. In patients with a Ct value < 25 and < 30, higher sensitivities of 100.0% (89.4-100.0, 95% CI) and 91.8% (81.9-97.3%, 95% CI) were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The AMP RAT showed a high sensitivity in patients with a Ct value < 25 and < 30 and might be helpful for frontline testing whenever rRT-PCR is not readily available.","Leixner, Georg; Voill-Glaninger, Astrid; Bonner, Elisabeth; Kreil, Anna; Zadnikar, René; Viveiros, André",Int J Infect Dis,,597

It is necessary to develop and offer strategies to reduce the psychological impact of the outbreak and promote adaptive coping. OBJECTIVE: This study protocol aims to describe a self-administered web-based intervention (Mental Health COVID-19) based on the principles of positive psychology supported by elements of cognitive behavioral therapy and behavioral activation therapy to reduce the symptoms of anxiety and depression and increase positive emotions and sleep quality during and after the COVID-19 outbreak through a telepsychology system. METHODS: A randomized controlled clinical superiority trial with two independent groups will be performed, with intrasubject measures at four evaluation periods: pretest, posttest, 3-month follow-up, and 6-month follow-up. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: self-administered intervention with assistance via chat or self-administered intervention without assistance via chat. The total required sample size will be 166 participants (83 per group). RESULTS: The clinical trial is ongoing. This protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Board of the Free School of Psychology-University of Behavioral Sciences (Escuela libre de Psicología-Universidad de Ciencias del Comportamiento). The aim is to publish the preliminary results in December 2020.

223008,Loneliness and social isolation: determinants of cardiovascular outcomes: Implications in COVID-19 era,2021,"COVID-19, What to do now? This issue has had devastating effects in all domains of society worldwide. Lockdowns, the lack of freedom and social distancing meant the closure of a country's entire activity. Having effects at all levels, beside incalculable ones in health, it is argued that scientific activity in education, business, economics and management suffered some of the most drastic impacts of this pandemic. This study aims to map the scientific literature in these areas in the context of COVID-19 and analyze its content through bibliometrics, which made it possible to highlight the scarcity of studies on the topic, namely empirical studies on the effects of this pandemic on scientific research and teaching/education. The results show there is a lack of peer-reviewed publications on this topic, with the studies covered (93) via the threads used revealing only 28 articles coming within the proposed objective. The bibliometrics corroborates that shortage. Finally, the contributions and implications for theory and practice are presented, followed by the limitations and suggestions for future research.","Rodrigues, M.; Franco, M.; Silva, R.",Sustainability,,597

To reveal the binding differences of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domains (RBDs) to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) at different temperatures at atomic level, 20 molecular dynamics simulations were carried out for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBD-ACE2 complexes at five selected temperatures, i.e. 200, 250, 273, 300 and 350 K. The analyses on structural flexibility and conformational distribution indicated that the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD was more stable than that of the SARS-CoV RBD at all investigated temperatures. Then, molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area and solvated interaction energy approaches were combined to estimate the differences in binding affinity of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs to ACE2; it is found that the binding ability of ACE2 to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD was stronger than that to the SARS-CoV RBD at five temperatures, and the main reason for promoting such binding differences is electrostatic and polar interactions between RBDs and ACE2. Finally, the hotspot residues facilitating the binding of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs to ACE2, the key differential residues contributing to the difference in binding and the interaction mechanism of differential residues that exist at all investigated temperatures were analyzed and compared in depth. The current work would provide a molecular basis for better understanding of the high infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 and offer better theoretical guidance for the design of inhibitors targeting infectious diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2.","Yan, Fang-Fang; Gao, Feng",Brief Bioinform,,597

Previous studies suggested that pets could be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. Here, we investigated the putative infection by SARS-CoV-2 in 22 cats and 11 dogs from owners previously infected or suspected of being infected by SARS-CoV-2. For each animal, rectal, nasopharyngeal swabs and serum were taken. Swabs were submitted to RT-qPCR assays targeting 2 genes of SARS-CoV-2. All dogs were tested SARS-CoV-2 negative. One cat was tested positive by RT-qPCR on rectal swab. Nasopharyngeal swabs from this animal were tested negative. This cat showed mild respiratory and digestive signs. Serological analysis confirms the presence of antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 in both serum samples taken 10 days apart. Genome sequence analysis revealed that the cat SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the phylogenetic clade A2a like most of the French human SARS-CoV-2. This study reports for the first time the natural infection of a cat in France (near Paris) probably through their owners.

However, public interest and demand for telehealth during the pandemic remain unknown. OBJECTIVE: We used an infodemiological approach to estimate the worldwide demand for telehealth services during COVID-19, focusing on the 50 most affected countries and comparing the demand for such services with the level of information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure available. METHODS: We used Google Trends, the Baidu Index (China), and Yandex Keyword Statistics (Russia) to extract data on worldwide and individual countries' telehealth-related internet searches from January 1 to July 7, 2020, presented as relative search volumes (RSV; range 0-100). Daily COVID-19 cases and deaths were retrieved from the World Health Organization. Individual countries' ICT infrastructure profiles were retrieved from the World Economic Forum Report. RESULTS: Across the 50 countries, the mean RSV was 18.5 (SD 23.2), and the mean ICT index was 62.1 (SD 15.0). An overall spike in worldwide telehealth-related RSVs was observed from March 11, 2020 (RSV peaked to 76.0), which then tailed off in June-July 2020 (mean RSV for the period was 25.8), but remained higher than pre-March RSVs (mean 7.29). By country, 42 (84%) manifested increased RSVs over the evaluation period, with the highest observed in Canada (RSV=100) and the United States (RSV=96). When evaluating associations between RSV and the ICT index, both the United States and Canada demonstrated high RSVs and ICT scores (&#8805;70.3). In contrast, European countries had relatively lower RSVs (range 3.4-19.5) despite high ICT index scores (mean 70.3). Several Latin American (Brazil, Chile, Colombia) and South Asian (India, Bangladesh, Pakistan) countries demonstrated relatively higher RSVs (range 13.8-73.3) but low ICT index scores (mean 44.6), indicating that the telehealth demand outstrips the current ICT infrastructure. CONCLUSIONS: There is generally increased interest and demand for telehealth services across the 50 countries most affected by COVID-19, highlighting the need to scale up telehealth capabilities, during and beyond the pandemic.","Wong, Mark Yu Zheng; Gunasekeran, Dinesh Visva; Nusinovici, Simon; Sabanayagam, Charumathi; Yeo, Khung Keong; Cheng, Ching-Yu; Tham, Yih-Chung",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,597

So far, the number of COVID-19-associated deaths per 100,000 individuals is far lower in these countries as compared with other neighbouring or close countries. The use of face masks in public may not protect the general public from contracting the virus, however, presumptively decreases the viral load and contributes to a favourable clinical outcome in COVID-19 disease. A certain time is required for antigen-specific T cells and B cells to fully develop. Obligatory face mask wearing in public favours the virus transmission through oral mucosa and/or conjunctival epithelium, which enables the adaptive immune responses to evolve. In the case of inhalation of high loads of SARS-CoV-2, the time for the development of fully protective adaptive immune responses seems to be insufficient. Then, a less specific and more damaging innate immune response prevails.","Strízová, Zuzana; Bartunková, Jirina; Smrz, Daniel",Cent Eur J Public Health,,597

The quality of the included studies was assessed using the QUADAS-2 checklist. A bivariate random-effects regression model was implemented. RESULTS: Meta-analysis of 12 included studies showed that the performances of commercial COVID-19 molecular in vitro diagnostic tests were high, with a summary sensitivity of 95.9% (95% CI 93.9-97.2%, I2 = 60.22%) and specificity of 97.2% (95% CI 95.5-98.3%, I2 = 56.66%).

Reducing patient exposure to COVID-19 became a primary concern, especially for populations at an increased risk for severe illness, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive patients. Objectives: The primary objective of this study was to measure the impact of pharmacy services including telehealth through the percentage of virologically suppressed patients (HIV ribonucleic acid [RNA] < 200 copies/mL) during the pre-COVID and post-COVID time periods. Secondary objectives included the percentage of patients with undetectable viral loads (HIV RNA < 20 copies/mL), percentage of patients with cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) cell counts greater than 200 cells/mm3, and changes in CD4 cell counts and percentages pre-COVID and post-COVID. Methods: This was a retrospective chart review at a single center HIV primary care clinic in Brooklyn, NY evaluating electronic medical records (EMRs) of 211 HIV-positive patients. Pre-COVID was defined as 1 year prior to March 13, 2020, and post-COVID was defined as March 13 to July 20, 2020. Results: Viral load suppression rates for pre and post-COVID were 88.6% and 85.3%, respectively (P = .28). Undetectable viral load rates for pre and post-COVID were approximately 81.5% and 74.4% (P = .096). Mean CD4 cell counts and percentages were 617 cells/mm3 and 29% for pre-COVID, and 460 cells/mm3 and 22% for post-COVID. CD4 cell counts greater than 200 cells/mm3 pre-COVID and post-COVID was 92.6% and 78.3%, respectively (P = .001). Conclusion: Utilization of pharmacy services including telehealth, may allow clinical pharmacists to collaboratively provide remote services without jeopardizing patient outcomes.

226923,Covid-19 mortality review: Current smokers Are under-represented and cannot be Explained by ethnicity alone,2021,"COVID-19 is a worldwide emergency; therefore, there is a critical need for foundational knowledge about B and T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 essential for vaccine development. However, little information is available defining which determinants of SARS-CoV-2 other than the spike glycoprotein are recognized by the host immune system. In this study, we focus on the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein as a suitable candidate target for vaccine formulations. Major B and T cell epitopes of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein are predicted and resulting sequences compared with the homolog immunological domains of other coronaviruses that infect human beings. The most dominant of B cell epitope is located between 176-206 amino acids in the SRGGSQASSRSSSRSRNSSRNSTPGSSRGTS sequence. Further, we identify sequences which are predicted to bind multiple common MHC I and MHC II alleles. Most notably there is a region of potential T cell cross-reactivity within the SARS-CoV-2 N protein position 102-110 amino acids that traverses multiple human alpha and betacoronaviruses. Vaccination strategies designed to target these conserved epitope regions could generate immune responses that are cross-reactive across human coronaviruses, with potential to protect or modulate disease. Finally, these predictions can facilitate effective vaccine design against this high priority virus.","Oliveira, Sergio C; de Magalhães, Mariana T Q; Homan, E Jane",Front Immunol,,597

However, only a few coronavirus helicase inhibitors have been patented. These patents include drug-like compound SSYA10-001, aryl diketo acids (ADK), and dihydroxychromones. Additionally, adamantane-derived bananins, natural flavonoids, one acrylamide derivative [(E)-3-(furan-2-yl)-N-(4-sulfamoylphenyl)acrylamide], a purine derivative (7-ethyl-8-mercapto-3-methyl-3,7-dihydro-1H-purine-2,6-dione), and a few bismuth complexes. The IC50 of patented inhibitors ranges between 0.82 µM and 8.95 µM, depending upon the assays used. Considering the urgency of clinical interventions against Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19), it is important to consider developing antiviral portfolios consisting of small molecules. AREAS COVERED: This review examines coronavirus helicases as antiviral targets, and the potential of previously patented and experimental compounds to inhibit the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) helicase.Small molecule coronavirus helicase inhibitors represent attractive pharmacological modalities for the treatment of coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Rightfully so, the current emphasis is focused upon the development of vaccines. However, vaccines may not work for everyone and broad-based adoption of vaccinations is an increasingly challenging societal endeavor. Therefore, it is important to develop additional pharmacological antivirals against the highly conserved coronavirus helicases to broadly protect against this and subsequent coronavirus epidemics.","Spratt, Austin N; Gallazzi, Fabio; Quinn, Thomas P; Lorson, Christian L; Sönnerborg, Anders; Singh, Kamal",,,597

Prolonged ICU stay is a risk factor for the development of nosocomial candidemia. The current study aimed to investigate the incidence and risk factors associated with the development of nosocomial candidemia among patients admitted to the ICU for COVID-19. Patients who developed nosocomial candidemia were identified, and their clinical course was reported. A 1:3 case control matching was used to identify non-candidemia patients who served as controls. 89 patients were admitted to the ICU for COVID-19 during the study period. The incidence of nosocomial candidemia was 8.9% (n=8). Case-control matching identified 24 patients with similar disease severity at the time of ICU admission. Median time to first isolation of yeast was 26 days. Candidemia patients reported longer median ICU stay than controls. (40 vs. 10 days, p=0.004). In hospital death rates were comparable in both groups (38% vs. 54%, p=0.548). Prolonged mechanical ventilation support was associated with the development of nosocomial candidemia.

The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants has caused an unexpected rebound globally. The World Health Organization has listed three variants (B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1) as variants of concern. To understand the epidemiology and thereby plan appropriate safety measures, differential identification of the variants is indeed critical. OBJECTIVES: . Although whole-genome sequencing is the gold standard for variant identification, it is time-consuming and relatively expensive. Therefore, a rapid, easy, and cost-effective platform targeting multiple regions of the genome is required. Here, we assessed the usefulness of the Novaplex&#8482; SARS-CoV-2 Variants I Assay kit in identifying mutations in the variants. STUDY DESIGN: . We retrospectively examined 30 stored nasal swabs from COVID-19-positive patients tested between November 2020 and March 2021. RNA extracted from these swabs was subjected to the commercial kit and real-time reverse transcription-PCR was performed. To determine the genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 in the collected samples and deduce the consensus sequences among the identified variants, genome sequencing libraries were prepared and mapped to the reference genome. RESULTS: . Four of the tested samples were determined as variants. Of them, two harbored both H69/V70 deletion and N501Y substitution, whereas two harbored E484K substitution alone. CONCLUSIONS: . The variant with E484K substitution alone (""R.1"") has been now categorized as a variant of interest in Japan. Additionally, the kit-based assay was found to be feasible, convenient, and user-friendly in identifying the abovementioned mutations with a turnaround time of only 2 h.","Kami, Wakaki; Kinjo, Takeshi; Arakaki, Wakako; Oki, Hiroya; Motooka, Daisuke; Nakamura, Shota; Fujita, Jiro",J Clin Virol,,597

Methods: Uncinate process tissues were obtained from 61 chronic rhinosinusitis patients (of which, 39 had allergy and 22 did not) who were infected with HRV16 using an air-liquid interface organ culture system. The expression levels of programmed cell death-ligand (PD-L)1, PD-L2, intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), IFN-Î³, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 were evaluated in the infected nasal mucosa. Results: The HRV infection rates were not significantly different between allergy (74.4 %) and non-allergy (72.7 %) groups. In the allergy group, the expression of PD-L1 (P=0.013) and IL-10 (P=0.040) was significantly elevated in the HRV-infected tissues; there was a strong correlation between PDL1 and IL-10 (r= 0.868, P<0.001). In contrast, infected tissues from the non-allergy group displayed increased levels of IL-4 (P=0.039), IL-5 (P=0.023), and IFN-Î³ (P=0.031) as well as an increased IL-4/IFN-Î³ ratio after HRV infection (P=0.043). Conclusion: This study shows that, regardless of the presence of allergy, HRV infection rates are similar in the nasal mucosa of patients with CRS. HRV infection enhances the Th2 environment by modulating PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression levels in allergic mucosa and by increasing the IL-4/IFN-Î³ ratio in non-allergic mucosa.","Ko, Young-Kyung; Zhang, Yu-Lian; Wee, Jee Hye; Han, Doo Hee; Kim, Hyun Jik; Rhee, Chae-Seo",Clinical and experimental otorhinolaryngology,,597

Key stakeholders such as students, testing and evaluation services, and faculty were included in the planning process. In addition to changes in OSCE delivery, grading processes and remediation were also modified. Summary This Capstone OSCE merged virtual education and skills-based assessments together out of necessity and provides an example of flexibility and nimbleness in times of great change. Although further assessment is needed, processes used and lessons learned are helpful for future, intentional planning of virtual or partially virtual skills assessments.","Deville, Rebecca L.; Fellers, Caitlin M.; Howard, Meredith L.",Currents in Pharmacy Teaching and Learning,,597

World Health Organization (WHO) has defined COVID-19 as a global pandemic. Critical care ultrasound (CCUS) can rapidly acquire the image of lung and other organs and demonstrate the pathophysiological changes to guide precise therapy in COVID-19 pneumonia without radiation or interfering with personal protective equipment. In addition, the application of CCUS can cover the whole courses from the fever clinic to the intensive care unit to improve the treatment. We would like to present the CCUS features about COVID-19 pneumonia and share the application experience of CCUS in Wuhan, China, and hope it works for physicians worldwide to solve the problem and improve the outcome.","Zou, Tongjuan; Yin, Wanhong; Kang, Yan",IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control,,597
228462,The COVID-19 world - Are we there yet?,2021,"Abscopal effects are an important aspect of targeted radiation therapy due to their implication in normal tissue toxicity from chronic inflammatory responses and mutagenesis. Gene expression can be used to determine abscopal effects at the molecular level. Synchrotron microbeam radiation therapy utilizing high-intensity X rays collimated into planar microbeams is a promising cancer treatment due to its reported ability to ablate tumors with less damage to normal tissues compared to conventional broadbeam radiation therapy techniques. The low scatter of synchrotron radiation enables microbeams to be delivered to tissue effectively, and is also advantageous for out-of-field studies because there is minimal interference from scatter. Mouse legs were irradiated at a dose rate of 49 Gy/s and skin samples in the out-of-field areas were collected. The out-of-field skin showed an increase in Tnf expression and a decrease in Mdm2 expression, genes associated with inflammation and DNA damage. These expression effects from microbeam exposure were similar to those found with broadbeam exposure. In immune-deficient Ccl2 knockout mice, we identified a different gene expression profile which showed an early increase in Mdm2, Tgfb1, Tnf and Ccl22 expression in out-of-field skin that was not observed in the immune-proficient mice. Our results suggest that the innate immune system is involved in out-of-field tissue responses and alterations in the immune response may not eliminate abscopal effects, but could change them.","Forrester, Helen B; Lobachevsky, Pavel N; Stevenson, Andrew W; Hall, Christopher J; Martin, Olga A; Sprung, Carl N",Radiat. res,,597
228463,The Covid-19 world-Are we there yet?,2021,"Importance: The COVID-19 pandemic coupled with health disparities have highlighted the disproportionate burden of disease among Black, Hispanic, and Native American (ie, American Indian or Alaska Native) populations. Increasing transparency around the representation of these populations in health care professions may encourage efforts to increase diversity that could improve cultural competence among health care professionals and reduce health disparities. Objective: To estimate the racial/ethnic diversity of the current health care workforce and the graduate pipeline for 10 health care professions and to evaluate whether the diversity of the pipeline suggests greater representation of Black, Hispanic, and Native American populations in the future. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study used weighted data from the 2019 American Community Survey (ACS) to compare the diversity of 10 health care occupations (advanced practice registered nurses, dentists, occupational therapists, pharmacists, physical therapists, physician assistants, physicians, registered nurses, respiratory therapists, and speech-language pathologists) with the diversity of the US working-age population, and 2019 data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) were used to compare the diversity of graduates with that of the US population of graduation age. Data from the IPEDS included all awards and degrees conferred between July 1, 2018, and June 30, 2019, in the US. Main Outcomes and Measures: A health workforce diversity index (diversity index) was developed to compare the racial/ethnic diversity of the 10 health care professions (or the graduates in the pipeline) analyzed with the racial/ethnic diversity of the current working-age population (or average student-age population). For the current workforce, the index was the ratio of current workers in a health occupation to the total working-age population by racial/ethnic group. For new graduates, the index was the ratio of recent graduates to the population aged 20 to 35 years by racial/ethnic group. A value equal to 1 indicated equal representation of the racial/ethnic groups in the current workforce (or pipeline) compared with the working-age population. Results: The study sample obtained from the 2019 ACS comprised a weighted total count of 148 358 252 individuals aged 20 to 65 years (White individuals: 89 756 689; Black individuals: 17 916 227; Hispanic individuals: 26 953 648; and Native American individuals: 1 108 404) who were working or searching for work and a weighted total count of 71 608 009 individuals aged 20 to 35 years (White individuals: 38 995 242; Black individuals: 9 830 765; Hispanic individuals: 15 257 274; and Native American individuals: 650 221) in the educational pipeline. Among the 10 professions assessed, the mean diversity index for Black people was 0.54 in the current workforce and in the educational pipeline. In 5 of 10 health care professions, representation of Black graduates was lower than representation in the current workforce (eg, occupational therapy: 0.31 vs 0.50). The mean diversity index for Hispanic people was 0.34 in the current workforce; it improved to 0.48 in the educational pipeline but remained lower than 0.50 in 6 of 10 professions, including physical therapy (0.33). The mean diversity index for Native American people was 0.54 in the current workforce and increased to 0.57 in the educational pipeline. Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that Black, Hispanic, and Native American people were underrepresented in the 10 health care professions analyzed. Although some professions had greater diversity than others and there appeared to be improvement among graduates in the educational pipeline compared with the current workforce, additional policies are needed to further strengthen and support a workforce that is more representative of the population.","Salsberg, Edward; Richwine, Chelsea; Westergaard, Sara; Portela Martinez, Maria; Oyeyemi, Toyese; Vichare, Anushree; Chen, Candice P",JAMA Netw Open,,597

(Special Issue: COVID-19 collection.),2020,"With the loosening of the male guardianship system (Wilaya) in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), this study examines the contribution of m-government to the empowerment of Saudi women. We employ the key concepts of Sen's Capability Approach (CA) to understand how m-government services in the KSA have provided opportunities for women to become empowered. The findings of the study indicate that m-government contributes towards women's empowerment by providing opportunities to participate in social and economic activities. However, there are also key social and cultural factors that impede the use of m-government services for empowerment, and we found these to include religious beliefs, Saudi traditions and customs, and husbands' jealousy. The study makes some important contributions to theory and practice by being the first study to focus on the use that Saudi women make of the opportunities now available to them to access government services through m-government applications and to address the cultural barriers which may function to prevent their access.","Alotaibi, Norah Humus; Dasuki, Salihu; Zamani, Efpraxia",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.09745v1.pdf,597

OBJECTIVES: We performed a meta-analysis to assess the efficacy and safety of anakinra in adult hospitalized non-intubated patients with COVID-19. SEARCH METHODS: Relevant trials were identified by searching literature until 24 April 2021 using the following terms: anakinra, interleukin 1, coronavirus, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2. SELECTION CRITERIA: Trials evaluating the effect of anakinra on the need for invasive mechanical ventilation and mortality in hospitalized non-intubated patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: Nine studies (n = 1,119) were eligible for inclusion in the present meta-analysis. Their bias risk with reference to the assessed parameters was high. In pooled analyses, anakinra reduced the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (odds ratio, OR: 0·38, 95% confidence interval, CI: 0·17-0·85, p= 0.02, I2=67%; 6 studies, n = 587) and mortality risk (OR: 0·32, 95% CI: 0·23-0·45, p< 0·00001, I2=0%; 9 studies, n = 1,119) compared with standard of care therapy. There were no differences regarding the risk of adverse events, including liver dysfunction (OR: 0·75, 95% CI: 0·48-1·16, p> 0·05, I2=28%; 5 studies, n = 591) and bacteremia (OR: 1·07, 95% CI: 0·42-2·73, p> 0·05, I2=71%; 6 studies, n = 727). CONCLUSIONS: Available evidence shows that treatment with anakinra reduces both the need for invasive mechanical ventilation and mortality risk of hospitalized non-intubated patients with COVID-19 without increasing the risk of adverse events. Confirmation of efficacy and safety requires randomized placebo-controlled trials.","Barkas, Fotios; Ntekouan, Sebastian Filippas; Kosmidou, Maria; Liberopoulos, Evangelos; Liontos, Angelos; Milionis, Haralampos",Rheumatology (Oxford),,597

230647,"The critical component as part of the strategies for medical care, prevention and control of COVID-19",2020,"Location privacy has been extensively studied in the literature. However, existing location privacy models are either not rigorous or not customizable, which limits the trade-off between privacy and utility in many real-world applications. To address this issue, we propose a new location privacy notion called PGLP, i.e., \textit{Policy Graph based Location Privacy}, providing a rich interface to release private locations with customizable and rigorous privacy guarantee. First, we design the privacy metrics of PGLP by extending differential privacy. Specifically, we formalize a user's location privacy requirements using a \textit{location policy graph}, which is expressive and customizable. Second, we investigate how to satisfy an arbitrarily given location policy graph under adversarial knowledge. We find that a location policy graph may not always be viable and may suffer \textit{location exposure} when the attacker knows the user's mobility pattern. We propose efficient methods to detect location exposure and repair the policy graph with optimal utility. Third, we design a private location trace release framework that pipelines the detection of location exposure, policy graph repair, and private trajectory release with customizable and rigorous location privacy. Finally, we conduct experiments on real-world datasets to verify the effectiveness of the privacy-utility trade-off and the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.","Cao, Yang; Xiao, Yonghui; Takagi, Shun; Xiong, Li; Yoshikawa, Masatoshi; Shen, Yilin; Liu, Jinfei; Jin, Hongxia; Xu, Xiaofeng",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.01263v1.pdf,597

METHODS: This retrospective study reviewed 60 critically ill patients (43 males and 17 females, mean age 64.4 ± 11.0 years) with COVID-19 pneumonia who were admitted to two different clinical centers. Their clinical and medical records were analyzed, and the chest CT images were assessed to determine the involvement of lobes and the distribution of lesions in the lungs between the patients who recovered from the illness and those who died. RESULTS: Compared with recovered patients (50/60, 83%), deceased patients (10/60, 17%) were older (mean age, 70.6 vs. 62.6 years, p = 0.044). C-reactive protein (CRP) (110.8 ± 26.3 mg/L vs 63.0 ± 50.4 mg/L, p < 0.001) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (18.7 ± 16.6 vs 8.4 ± 7.5, p = 0.030) were significantly elevated in the deceased as opposed to the recovered. Medial or parahilar area involvement was observed in all the deceased patients (10/10, 100%), when compared to only 54% (27/50) in the recovered. Ground-glass opacities (97%), crazy-paving pattern (92%), and air bronchogram (93%) were the most common radiological findings. There was significant difference in diabetes (p = 0.025) and emphysema (p = 0.013), and the odds ratio on a deceased patient having diabetes and emphysema was 6 times and 21 times the odds ratio on a recovered patient having diabetes and emphysema, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Older patients with comorbidities such as diabetes and emphysema, and higher CRP and NLRs with diffuse lung involvement were more likely to die of COVID-19. KEY POINTS: â¢ Almost all patients critically ill with COVID-19 pneumonia had five lung lobes involved. â¢ Medial or parahilar area involvement and degree of lung involvement were more serious in the deceased patients when compared with those who recovered from treatment. â¢ Chronic lung disease, e.g., emphysema, diabetes, and higher serum CRP and NLR characterized patients who died of COVID-19.","Zhang, Nan; Xu, Xunhua; Zhou, Ling-Yan; Chen, Gang; Li, Yu; Yin, Huiming; Sun, Zhonghua",Eur Radiol,,597

Materials and Methods: The object of research was 45 black motley cows and their calves from birth to 2 months of life. Serum and colostrum samples were screened for antibodies against Rotavirus, diarrhea, and coronavirus using serological methods. The testing was performed before vaccination, 40 days before calving, 20 days before calving, and before calving. Colostrum samples were taken during the first milk yield. Serum samples from calves were drawn before colostrum feeding as well as at 7, 14, and 21 days, and 1 and 2 months of age. To measure the level of immunoglobulins A, M, and G, additional serum samples were collected from calves at 25, 35, 65, and 75 days after birth. Results: Giving pregnant cows, an IFN-based drug at a dose of 1 ml/kg 48 h before vaccination results in the development and accumulation of antibodies to Rotavirus, coronavirus, and viral diarrhea (VD) in the colostrum, with a titer of 7.6±0.3 log2, 5.8±0.34 log2, and 4.4±0.18 log2, respectively. It indicates an increase in the antigenic activity of the multivalent vaccine. Conclusion: IFN-based drugs enhance the protective effect of vaccination against associative infections in the newborn calves. They stimulate a rise in the titer of antibodies to Rotavirus, coronavirus, VD, and mucosal disease complex as well as an increase in immunoglobulins A, M, and G.","Andreeva, Alfia; Nikolaeva, Oksana; Altynbekov, Oleg; Galieva, Chulpan; Ilina, Kseniia",Vet.

We sought to examine colchicine's effects on circulating inflammatory and metabolic molecules in adults with obesity and metabolic syndrome (MetS). METHODS: Blood samples were collected pre- and post-intervention during a double-blind randomized controlled trial in which 40 adults with obesity and MetS were randomized to colchicine 0.6 mg or placebo twice-daily for 3 months. Serum samples were analyzed for 1305 circulating factors using the SomaScan Platform. The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was used to adjust the false discovery rate (FDR) for multiple testing. RESULTS: At baseline, age (48.0 ± 13.8 vs. 44.7 ± 10.3 years) and BMI (39.8 ± 6.4 vs. 41.8 ± 8.2 kg/m2) were not different between groups. After controlling for the FDR, 34 molecules were significantly changed by colchicine. Colchicine decreased concentrations of multiple inflammatory molecules, including C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, and resistin, in addition to vascular-related proteins (e.g., oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor, phosphodiesterase 5A). Conversely, relative to placebo, colchicine significantly increased concentrations of eight molecules including secreted factors associated with metabolism and anti-thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: In adults with obesity, colchicine significantly affected concentrations of proteins involved in the innate immune system, endothelial function and atherosclerosis, uncovering new mechanisms behind its cardiometabolic effects.

It also assessed the knowledge and attitude of patients to the COVID-19 infection and the willingness to carry out specific precautionary measures in the orthodontic clinics to mitigate the spread of the virus. METHODS: It was a cross-sectional descriptive study. Questionnaires were distributed to orthodontic patients via Google forms. The questionnaire assessed participants' knowledge, attitude, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on orthodontic treatment, and willingness to carry out infection control precautionary measures in the orthodontic clinic. RESULTS: A total of 304 responses were obtained; 83 males (27.3%), 221 females (72.7%) with a mean age of 35.6 years. Subjects demonstrated good knowledge of COVID-19 infection (94.7%). Most respondents (95%) considered the infection as dangerous and believed the orthodontic patient was at risk of contracting the disease but were willing regardless to carry on with their orthodontic treatment during the pandemic. Fear of contracting the COVID-19 virus during orthodontic appointments and missed orthodontic appointments (74%), and increased treatment time (50%) were the immediate and long-term concerns, respectively. A high acceptance rate of compliance to precautionary measures to mitigate virus spread in the clinic was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on the orthodontic treatment and the financial and emotional wellbeing of orthodontic patients. Patients were willing to continue with orthodontic management during the pandemic while complying with precautionary measures to prevent disease spread in the orthodontic practice setting.","Umeh, Onyinye Dorothy; Utomi, Ifeoma Linda; Isiekwe, Ikenna Gerald; Aladenika, Emmanuel T",Am. j. orthod. dentofacial orthop,,597

234848,The role of imaging and other diagnostic approaches in COVID-19,2020,"Suicidal ideation is prevalent in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD); but, during COVID-19, it may be increased. The present study aimed to examine the effects of obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptom dimensions and OCD severity on suicidal ideation by considering the role of stress responses in reaction to COVID-19 in a clinical sample of patients with OCD. In a cross-sectional study, 304 patients with OCD completed measures of OC symptom dimensions, OCD severity, general mental health (depression and anxiety), and COVID-19-related stress. Results showed that after controlling for depression, anxiety, comorbidity, and lifetime suicide attempts, the OC symptom dimensions of responsibility for harm and unacceptable obsessional thoughts as well as general severity had indirect effects on suicidal ideation through the specific stress responses to COVID-19, including traumatic stress and compulsive checking. The study shows that OCD patients with specific OC symptom dimensions and severe OCD are more likely to have suicidal ideation during the pandemic. Further, the specific stress responses to COVID-19 may be an underlying mechanism. Clinicians should carefully assess suicidal ideation in patients with OCD who experience responsibility for harm and unacceptable thoughts, particularly during the pandemic.","Khosravani, Vahid; Samimi Ardestani, Seyed Mehdi; Sharifi Bastan, Farangis; McKay, Dean; Asmundson, Gordon J G",Clin. psychol. psychother,,597

A control group was used to compare the cumulative incidence and case fatality rate (CFR). The main outcomes of the study were cumulative incidence, defined as number of patients with active epilepsy and COVID-19 admitted to an emergency department divided by the total number of patients with epilepsy at risk, and CFR based on the number of deaths during the enrollment period. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate risk factors for fatality in patients with active epilepsy.Results:Of the 1537 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria, 21 (1.3%) had active epilepsy. The cumulative incidence (95% CI) of COVID-19 in patients with epilepsy was higher (1.2% [0.6-2.4]) compared to the population without epilepsy (0.5% [0.5-0.5]). In reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction?positive patients, there were no significant differences in CFR in patients with active epilepsy compared to patients without epilepsy (33.3% vs 8.3%;P = .266). Of the 21 patients with active epilepsy, 5 (23%) died. In multivariate analysis, the factor associated with fatality in patients with active epilepsy was hypertension (odds ratio [OR] 2.8 [95% CI: 1.3-21.6]). In another model, age (OR: 1.0 [95% CI: 1.0-1.1]) and epilepsy (OR: 5.1 [95% CI: 1.3-24.0]) were associated with fatality during hospitalization.Conclusion:COVID-19 cumulative incidence was higher in patients with active epilepsy.

239782,The Critical Need for Pause in the COVID-19 Era,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern (VOCs) continue to wreak havoc across the globe. Higher transmissibility and immunologic resistance of VOCs bring unprecedented challenges to epidemic extinguishment. Here we describe a monoclonal antibody, 2G1, that neutralizes all current VOCs and has surprising tolerance to mutations adjacent to or within its interaction epitope. Cryo-electron microscopy structure showed that 2G1 bound to the tip of receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein with small contact interface but strong hydrophobic effect, which resulted in nanomolar to sub-nanomolar affinities to spike proteins. The epitope of 2G1 on RBD partially overlaps with ACE2 interface, which gives 2G1 ability to block interaction between RBD and ACE2. The narrow binding epitope but high affinity bestow outstanding therapeutic efficacy upon 2G1 that neutralized VOCs with sub-nanomolar IC50 in vitro. In SARS-CoV-2 and Beta- and Delta-variant-challenged transgenic mice and rhesus macaque models, 2G1 protected animals from clinical illness and eliminated viral burden, without serious impact to animal safety. Mutagenesis experiments suggest that 2G1 could be potentially capable of dealing with emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants in future. This report characterized the therapeutic antibodies specific to the tip of spike against SARS-CoV-2 variants and highlights the potential clinical applications as well as for developing vaccine and cocktail therapy.","Ma, Hang; Guo, Yingying; Tang, Haoneng; Tseng, Chien-Te; Wang, Lei; Zong, Huifang; Wang, Zhenyu; He, Yang; Chang, Yunsong; Wang, Shusheng; Huang, Haiqiu; Ke, Yong; Yuan, Yunsheng; Wu, Mingyuan; Zhang, Yuanyuan; Drelich, Aleksandra; Kempaiah, Kempaiah; Peng, Bi-Hung; Wang, Ailin; Yang, Kaiyong; Yin, Haiyang; Liu, Junjun; Yue, Yali; Xu, Wenbo; Zhu, Shuangli; Ji, Tianjiao; Li, Gang; Liu, Guangchun; Song, Jingjing; Mu, Lingling; Xiang, ZongShang; Song, Zhangyi; Chen, Hua; Bian, Yanlin; Zhang, Baohong; Chen, Hui; Zhang, Jiawei; Liao, Yunji; Zhang, Li; Gilly, John; Xiao, Xiaodong; Han, Lei; Jiang, Hua; Xie, Yueqing; Zhou, Qiang; Zhu, Jianwei",,,597

It is reported that at least 7000 health care workers (HCW) had lost their lives due to COVID-19 from the beginning of the pandemia till September 2020 in the world. In our country between the dates, March 11, 2020 which the first case was reported, and September 1, 2020, the date which our study has been finalized, 7428 HCW were infected by SARS-CoV-2, and 52 of them were deceased. In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the contact and illness of healthcare workers working outside of the pandemic clinics in our hospital and to examine the possible transmission routes and disease prognoses. Healthcare workers who were working outside the pandemic service between March 11, 2020 and September 1, 2020 and who had a definite diagnosis of COVID-19 and all hospital staff who had contacted with these people, and HCW who had contact with patients diagnosed with COVID-19 while receiving inpatient treatment in services other than the pandemic service was evaluated and classified as low, medium and high risk according to the risk scoring defined in the published ""Ministry of Health COVID-19 Guidelines"". Healthcare workers who were evaluated as contacted were questioned in detail regarding the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) at the time of contact, especially suitability of the masks, contact time and shape and all the data were recorded. A total of 53 index cases (40 HCW and 13 inpatients diagnosed as COVID-19) were detected during the study period. The number of HCW contacted with these index cases was 672. In our study, we examined the data of 40 index cases and 672 contacted HCW (total of 712 HCW). Only 3 of 40 index cases (7.5%) had hospital-acquired COVID-19 infection, the other 37 cases were infected by community sources. COVID-19 was not detected in 94.2% of the contacted HCW during the follow-up while 5.8% of them had positive PCR test results. Considering the possible way of contamination among the contacted HCW who developed COVID-19 during the follow-up period, it was determined that 13.1% of the cases were a result of taken care of patients, 86.9% of the cases were a result of being in hospital social environments (drinking tea, smoking, eating, chatting in the same room without personal precautions) and in the days after the contact, it was in the form of contact with healthcare personnel diagnosed with COVID-19. When the contacted HCW were questioned about using proper masks at the time of contact, we determined that 93.3% of them used masks during patient caring procedures, however, only 48.9% used masks when they were in social areas (p<0.001). Healthcare workers face an unprecedented risk of occupational disease and death due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is also observed that prolonged pandemia period caused health workers to disregard rigorous infection control precautions in social areas of hospitals which they follow inpatient care although this has shown to be the most common way of contamination. Commonly performed in-service training and causing awareness in all areas of the hospital about following infection control precautions and PPE usage and checking the process regularly are the most important ways to prevent HCW from being affected by COVID-19.","Korkmaz, Derya; Konya, Petek; Tünay, Havva; Demirtürk, Nese",Mikrobiyol Bul,,597
240325,Telephone Fracture Clinic Consultations: A Satisfactory Solution in Lockdown,2021,"BACKGROUND: Management of critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation in austere environments or during disaster response is a logistic challenge. Availability of oxygen cylinders for mechanically ventilated patient may be difficult in such a context. A solution to ventilate patients requiring high fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is to use a ventilator able to be supplied by a low-pressure oxygen source connected with two oxygen concentrators (OCs). We tested the Elisée 350 (ResMedBella Vista, Australia) ventilator paired with two Newlife Intensity 10 (Airsep, Ball Ground, Georgia) OCs and evaluated the delivered FiO2 across a range of minute volumes and combinations of ventilator settings. METHODS: The ventilators were attached to a test lung, OC flow was adjusted with a Certifier FA ventilator test systems from 2 to 10 L/min and injected into the oxygen inlet port of the Elisée 350. The FiO2 was measured by the analyzer integrated in the ventilator, controlled by the ventilator test system. Several combinations of ventilator settings were evaluated to determine the factors affecting the delivered FiO2. RESULTS: The Elisée 350 ventilator is a turbine ventilator able to deliver high FiO2 when functioning with two OCs. However, modifications of the ventilator settings such as an increase in minute ventilation affect delivered FiO2 even if oxygen flow is constant on the OC. CONCLUSION: The ability of two OCs to deliver high FiO2 when used with a turbine ventilator makes this method of oxygen delivery a viable alternative to cylinders to ventilate patients requiring an FiO2 of &#8805;80% in austere place or during disaster response.

Central pontine myelinolysis (CPM), in which a focus of demyelination occurs in the pontine region, and extrapontine myelinolysis (EPM), in which foci of demyelination appear in the white matter of the cerebral hemispheres, can be distinguished as a part of this syndrome. We describe two clinical cases of CPM that developed due to hyponatremia and hypokalemia in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19). Differential diagnosis included acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, infectious encephalitis, and brain tumor. In both cases, a significant recovery of the lost functions was noted. The pathogenetic mechanisms of CPM development in patients with COVID-19 are discussed. ODS development in COVID-19 necessitates strict control and correction of electrolyte disturbances in this category of patients in accordance with existing recommendations, which can reduce the risk of CPM. © 2021 Ima-Press Publishing House.

241569,To a New Normal: Surgery and COVID-19 During the Transition Phase,2020,"BACKGROUND: Despite marked advances in the clinical therapies, clinical outcome of most T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patients remains poor, due to the high risk of relapse, even after complete remission. Previous studies suggest that the NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) has a dual role in hematologic malignancies, acting as a tumor suppressor or tumor promoter depending on the tumor type. However, little is known about the expression and functions of SIRT1 in T-ALL leukemogenesis. METHODS: Public RNA-seq data, a Notch1 driven T-ALL mouse model and Î³-secretase inhibitor were used to identify SIRT1 expression in T-ALL. We knocked down SIRT1 expression with ShRNAs and assessed the impacts of SIRT1 deficiency on cell proliferation, colony formation, the cell cycle and apoptosis. Transgenic SIRT1 knockout mice were used to determine the function of SIRT1 in vivo. RT-PCR, western blot, co-immunoprecipitation and ubiquitination analyses were used to detect SIRT1, p27 and CDK2 expression and their interactions. RESULTS: SIRT1 protein expression was positively correlated with the activation of Notch1. Downregulation of SIRT1 expression suppressed the proliferation and colony formation of T-ALL cell lines, which was reversed by SIRT1 overexpression. SIRT1 silencing prolonged the lifespan of T-ALL model mice. We demonstrated that p27 was involved in the downstream mechanism of cell cycle arrest induced by silencing SIRT1. SIRT1 increased the phosphorylation of p27 on Thr187 by deacetylating CDK2 and enhanced the interaction between p27 and SKP2 leading to the degradation of p27. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that SIRT1 is a promising target in T-ALL and offer a mechanistic link between the upregulation of SIRT1 and downregulation of p27.","Wang, Fangce; Li, Zheng; Zhou, Jie; Wang, Guangming; Zhang, Wenjun; Xu, Jun; Liang, Aibin",J Exp Clin Cancer Res,,597
241658,EXPRESS: Prevention vs. Promotion-Focus Regulatory Efforts on the Disease Incidence and Mortality of COVID-19: A Multinational Diffusion Study using Functional Data Analysis,2020,"Background: The role of subclinical severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections in perpetuating the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown because population seroprevalence data are absent. We aimed to establish the sensitivity and specificity of our enzyme immunoassay and microneutralisation assay, and the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in Hong Kong before and after the pandemic, as well as in Hong Kong residents evacuated from Hubei province, China. Methods: We did a multicohort study in a hospital and university in Hong Kong. We evaluated the sensitivity of our enzyme immunoassay and microneutralisation assay with RT-PCR data from patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 and the specificity of our enzyme immunoassay and microneutralisation assay with archived serum samples collected before 2019. We compared the seropositivity of the general population of Hong Kong before and after the pandemic had begun, and determined the seropositivity of Hong Kong residents evacuated from Hubei province, China, in March, 2020. Findings: Between Feb 26 and March 18, 2020, we assessed RT-PCR samples from 45 patients who had recovered from COVID-19 to establish the sensitivity of our enzyme immunoassay and microneutralisation assay. To establish the specificity of these assays, we retrieved archived serum. The sensitivity was 91·1% (41 of 45 [95% CI 78·8-97·5]) for the microneutralisation assay, 57·8% (26 of 45 [42·2-72·3]) for anti-nucleoprotein IgG, 66·7% (30 of 45 [51·1-80·0]) for anti-spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG, and 73·3% (33 of 45 [58·1-85·4]) for enzyme immunoassay (either positive for anti-nucleoprotein or anti-RBD IgG). The specificity was 100% (152 of 152 [95% CI 97·6-100·0]) for both the enzyme immunoassay and microneutralisation assay. Among the Hong Kong general population, 53 (2·7%) of 1938 were enzyme immunoassay positive, but of those who were positive, all 53 were microneutralisation negative, and no significant increase was seen in the seroprevalence between April 12, 2018, and Feb 13, 2020. Among asymptomatic Hubei returnees, 17 (4%) of 452 were seropositive with the enzyme immunoassay or the microneutralisation assay, with 15 (88%) of 17 seropositive with the microneutralisation assay, and two familial clusters were identified. Interpretation: Our serological data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is a new emerging virus. The seropositivity rate in Hubei returnees indicates that RT-PCR-confirmed patients only represent a small proportion of the total number of cases. The low seroprevalence suggests that most of the Hong Kong and Hubei population remain susceptible to COVID-19. Future waves of the outbreak are inevitable without a vaccine or antiviral prophylaxis. The role of age-related cross reactive non-neutralising antibodies in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 warrants further investigation.

242089,CORR Synthesis: What Evidence Is Available for the Continued Use of Telemedicine in Orthopaedic Surgery in the Post-COVID-19 Era?,2021,"Human coronaviruses (HCoV) are respiratory pathogens which have been known since the 1960's. In December 2019, a new betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was reported and is responsible for one of the biggest pandemics of the last two centuries. Similar to the HCoV-OC43 strain, available evidence suggests SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion associated with potential neurological disorders. Coronavirus infection of the central nervous system (CNS) is largely controlled by a viral factor, the spike glycoprotein (S) and a host factor, innate immunity. However, the interaction between these two factors remains elusive. Proteolytic cleavage of the S protein can occur at the interface between receptor binding (S1) and fusion (S2) domains (S1/S2), as well as in a position adjacent to a fusion peptide within S2 (S2'). Herein, using HCoV-OC43 as a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2, we report that both S protein sites are involved in neurovirulence and are required for optimal CNS infection. Whereas efficient cleavage at S1/S2 is associated with decreased virulence, the potentially cleavable putative S2' site is essential for efficient viral infection. Furthermore, type 1 interferon (IFN 1)-related innate immunity also plays an important role in the control of viral spread towards the spinal cord, by preventing infection of ependymal cells. Our results underline the link between the differential S cleavage and IFN 1 in the prevention of viral spread, to control the severity of infection and pathology in both immunocompetent and immunodeficient mice. Taken together, these results point towards two potential therapeutic anti-viral targets: cleavage of the S protein in conjunction with efficient IFN 1-related innate immunity to prevent or at least reduce neuroinvasion, neural spread, and potential associated neurovirulence of human coronaviruses.ImportanceHuman coronaviruses (HCoV) are recognized respiratory pathogens. The emergence of the novel pathogenic member of this family in December 2019 (SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19) poses a global health emergency. As with other coronaviruses reported previously, invasion of the human central nervous system (CNS), associated with diverse neurological disorders, was suggested for SARS-CoV-2. Herein, using the related HCoV-OC43 strain, we show that the viral spike protein constitutes a major neurovirulence factor and that type 1 interferon (IFN 1), in conjunction with cleavage of S protein by host proteases, represent important host factors that participate in the control of CNS infection.To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a direct link between cleavage of the S protein, innate immunity and neurovirulence. Understanding mechanisms of viral infection and spread in neuronal cells is essential to better design therapeutic strategies, and to prevent infection by human coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2 in human CNS especially in the vulnerable populations such as the elderly and immune-compromised individuals.","Le Coupanec, Alain; Desforges, Marc; Kaufer, Benedikt; Dubeau, Philippe; Côté, Marceline; Talbot, Pierre J",J. virol,,597

Preparation strategies for managing this pandemic have been keys to face the COVID-19 surge all over the world and all levels of care. MATERIALS AND METHODS: During the epidemic, the Italian society of pediatric emergency-urgency (SIMEUP) promoted a national survey aiming to evaluate preparedness and response of pediatric emergency departments (PED) critical in ensuring optimal management of COVID-19 cases. RESULTS: Our results suggest that Italian PED have promptly set a proactive approach to the present emergency. 98.9% of the hospitals have defined special pathways and assistive protocols concerning the management of pediatric COVID-19 cases. The highest percentage of application of the measures for preventive and protective for COVID-19 concerned the use of personal protective equipments. CONCLUSIONS: Results show that the following measures for pediatric patients, admitted in PED, have been promptly implemented throughout the whole country: eg. use of protective devices, pre-triage of patients accessing the hospital. Despite COVID-19 being a new threat, we have shown that by developing an easy-to-follow decision algorithm and clear plans for the interventional platform teams, we can ensure optimal health care workers and patients' safety.","Talarico, Valentina; Pinto, Luciano; Marseglia, Gian Luigi; Centonze, Antonella; Cristofaro, Concetta; Reina, Rocco; Nocerino, Agostino; Lubrano, Riccardo; Zampogna, Stefania",Ital J Pediatr,,597

243193,COVID-19: The Long Tail,2020,"Developing new photoactive materials and electrode preparation technology with high stability, repeatability, easy fabrication, and a low electron-hole recombination rate is promising for ideal photoelectrochemical (PEC) biosensors, but it remains a great challenge. Here, a porous and crystalline oriented two-dimensional (2D) ultrathin covalent organic framework film (D-TA COF film) was formed in situ on indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) substrates under very mild conditions. The structure and morphology of D-TA COF film were characterized by means of Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and powder X-ray diffraction. Compared with the randomly oriented D-TA COF powder drop-coated on ITO, the photocurrent of the D-TA COF film grown on the ITO surface in situ achieved as high as â¼333-fold increase. This photocurrent can be further amplified by O2 (acting as electron acceptors). Benefiting from the fabrication in situ, D-TA COF film also exhibited tough adhesion, assuring the film was difficult to separate from the electrode. Accordingly, D-TA COF film was applied as the photoactive material to build a PEC biosensor for H2O2 detection based on coupling with large amounts of catalase (CAT) through simple adsorption. The introduced CAT catalyzed the decomposition of H2O2 to O2, leading to an enhancement of the photocurrent response. As a result, a ""signal-on"" PEC biosensor was fabricated with good sensitivity, rapid response, and high stability, and it can also detect H2O2 released from living cells. Taking into account these advantages, the D-TA COF film is expected to be an ideal photoactive material to construct various PEC biosensors, which as far as we know have not been reported.","Liu, Tingting; Cui, Lin; Zhao, Huijuan; Zhang, Xiaomei",ACS Appl Mater Interfaces,,597

244404,COVID-19: A chance to be our best,2020,"BACKGROUND: Within 4 months of COVID-19 first being reported in the USA, it spread to every state and to more than 90% of all counties. During this period, the US COVID-19 response was highly decentralised, with stay-at-home directives issued by state and local officials, subject to varying levels of enforcement. The absence of a centralised policy and timeline combined with the complex dynamics of human mobility and the variable intensity of local outbreaks makes assessing the effect of large-scale social distancing on COVID-19 transmission in the USA a challenge. METHODS: We used daily mobility data derived from aggregated and anonymised cell (mobile) phone data, provided by Teralytics (Zürich, Switzerland) from Jan 1 to April 20, 2020, to capture real-time trends in movement patterns for each US county, and used these data to generate a social distancing metric. We used epidemiological data to compute the COVID-19 growth rate ratio for a given county on a given day. Using these metrics, we evaluated how social distancing, measured by the relative change in mobility, affected the rate of new infections in the 25 counties in the USA with the highest number of confirmed cases on April 16, 2020, by fitting a statistical model for each county. FINDINGS: Our analysis revealed that mobility patterns are strongly correlated with decreased COVID-19 case growth rates for the most affected counties in the USA, with Pearson correlation coefficients above 0·7 for 20 of the 25 counties evaluated. Additionally, the effect of changes in mobility patterns, which dropped by 35-63% relative to the normal conditions, on COVID-19 transmission are not likely to be perceptible for 9-12 days, and potentially up to 3 weeks, which is consistent with the incubation time of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 plus additional time for reporting. We also show evidence that behavioural changes were already underway in many US counties days to weeks before state-level or local-level stay-at-home policies were implemented, implying that individuals anticipated public health directives where social distancing was adopted, despite a mixed political message. INTERPRETATION: This study strongly supports a role of social distancing as an effective way to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in the USA. Until a COVID-19 vaccine is widely available, social distancing will remain one of the primary measures to combat disease spread, and these findings should serve to support more timely policy making around social distancing in the USA in the future.

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic was initially represented as a severe acute respiratory illness, with eventual dramatic complications. However, over time it revealed to be a complex systemic disease with manifestations derived from viral-induced inflammation and hypercoagulability, thus liable to affect any body organ or system. As a result, clinical presentation is variable, in addition to variations associated with several individual and collective risk factors. Given the extreme variability of pathology and clinical manifestations, a single, or a few, universal homeopathic preventive Do not split medicine(s) do not seem feasible. Yet homeopathy may have a relevant role to play, inasmuch as the vast majority of patients only exhibit the mild form of disease and are indicated to self-care at home, without standard monitoring, follow-up, or treatment. For future pandemics, homeopathy agencies should prepare by establishing rapid-response teams and efficacious lines of communication.","Waisse, Silvia; Oberbaum, Menachem; Frass, Michael",Homeopathy,,597

This research examines the positive and negative effects of online assessment on students' learning behaviour and how teachers prepare their teaching. This case study research included the result of questionnaire from thirty IC students followed by interview with three EFL teachers in the Intensive English Course (IC) program and six IC program students in one of Islamic University in Kediri. The small survey indicated that students have positive attitude toward the administration of online assessment. Furthermore, the outcomes of open-ended interviews showed that there were four themes for beneficial effects, including enhancing flexibility in assessment, improving evaluation versatility, building teachers and students' awareness of preparing evaluation and cultivating students' autonomous learning abilities. On the other hand, three themes for negative effects emerged from the online assessment, including complication of evaluation administration, reduced interaction between teachers and students, and anxiety in English test. The effects emerge from how teachers and students view the drawbacks of the online assessment itself. Positive effects lead to students' learning better are caused by lesson taken from conducting the test;however, the negatives should be treated as challenges that will improve the teaching and learning. Finally, both teachers and students are ready to face online assessment in the future.","Fitriyah, Ima Jannah Miftahul",Indonesian Journal of English Language Teaching and Applied Linguistics,,597

246532,Case Report: Handwashing-Induced Dermatitis During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"While the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues to strike and collect its death toll throughout the globe, as of 31 January 2021, the vaccine candidates worldwide were 292, of which 70 were in clinical testing. Several vaccines have been approved worldwide, and in particular, three have been so far authorized for use in the EU. Vaccination can be, in fact, an efficient way to mitigate the devastating effect of the pandemic and offer protection to some vulnerable strata of the population (i.e., the elderly) and reduce the social and economic burden of the current crisis. Regardless, a question is still open: after vaccination availability for the public, will vaccination campaigns be effective in reaching all the strata and a sufficient number of people in order to guarantee herd immunity? In other words: after we have it, will we be able to use it? Following the trends in vaccine hesitancy in recent years, there is a growing distrust of COVID-19 vaccinations. In addition, the online context and competition between pro- and anti-vaxxers show a trend in which anti-vaccination movements tend to capture the attention of those who are hesitant. Describing this context and analyzing its possible causes, what interventions or strategies could be effective to reduce COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy? Will social media trend analysis be helpful in trying to solve this complex issue? Are there perspectives for an efficient implementation of COVID-19 vaccination coverage as well as for all the other vaccinations?","Gori, Davide; Reno, Chiara; Remondini, Daniel; Durazzi, Francesco; Fantini, Maria Pia",,,597

246887,Encounters in the Silent Land of COVID-19 Quarantine: Art and Literature,2021,"Editor office's response for Ahead of Print article withdrawn The article ""Potential false-positive rate among the 'asymptomatic infected individuals' in close contacts of COVID-19 patients"" was under strong discussion after pre-published. Questions from the readers mainly focused on the article's results and conclusions were depended on theoretical deduction, but not the field epidemiology data and further researches were needed to prove the current theory. Based on previous discussions, the article was decided to be offline by the editorial board from the pre-publish lists. Objective: As the prevention and control of COVID-19continues to advance, the active nucleic acid test screening in the close contacts of the patients has been carrying out in many parts of China. However, the false-positive rate of positive results in the screening has not been reported up to now. But to clearify the false-positive rate during screening is important in COVID-19 control and prevention. Methods: Point values and reasonable ranges of the indicators which impact the false-positive rate of positive results were estimated based on the information available to us at present. The false-positive rate of positive results in the active screening was deduced, and univariate and multivariate-probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to understand the robustness of the findings. Results: When the infection rate of the close contacts and the sensitivity and specificity of reported results were taken as the point estimates, the positive predictive value of the active screening was only 19.67%, in contrast, the false-positive rate of positive results was 80.33%. The multivariate-probabilistic sensitivity analysis results supported the base-case findings, with a 75% probability for the false-positive rate of positive results over 47%. Conclusions: In the close contacts of COVID-19 patients, nearly half or even more of the 'asymptomatic infected individuals' reported in the active nucleic acid test screening might be false positives.","Zhuang, G H; Shen, M W; Zeng, L X; Mi, B B; Chen, F Y; Liu, W J; Pei, L L; Qi, X; Li, C",Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,,597
246892,Correction to: How has COVID-19 affected the treatment of osteoporosis? An IOF-NOF-ESCEO global survey,2021,"Recent reports using conventional Susceptible, Exposed, Infected and Removed models suggest that the next wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK could overwhelm health services, with fatalities exceeding the first wave. We used Bayesian model comparison to revisit these conclusions, allowing for heterogeneity of exposure, susceptibility and transmission. We used dynamic causal modelling to estimate the evidence for alternative models of daily cases and deaths from the USA, the UK, Brazil, Italy, France, Spain, Mexico, Belgium, Germany and Canada over the period 25 January 2020 to 15 June 2020. These data were used to estimate the proportions of people (i) not exposed to the virus, (ii) not susceptible to infection when exposed and (iii) not infectious when susceptible to infection. Bayesian model comparison furnished overwhelming evidence for heterogeneity of exposure, susceptibility and transmission. Furthermore, both lockdown and the build-up of population immunity contributed to viral transmission in all but one country. Small variations in heterogeneity were sufficient to explain large differences in mortality rates. The best model of UK data predicts a second surge of fatalities will be much less than the first peak. The size of the second wave depends sensitively on the loss of immunity and the efficacy of Find-Test-Trace-Isolate-Support programmes. In summary, accounting for heterogeneity of exposure, susceptibility and transmission suggests that the next wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic will be much smaller than conventional models predict, with less economic and health disruption. This heterogeneity means that seroprevalence underestimates effective herd immunity and, crucially, the potential of public health programmes.","Friston, Karl; Costello, Anthony; Pillay, Deenan",,,597
246986,Corporate Social Responsibility: Business Responses to Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic,2021,"As of December 14, 2020, children and adolescents aged <18 years have accounted for 10.2% of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases reported in the United States.* Mitigation strategies to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, among persons of all ages, are important for pandemic control. Characterization of risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection among children and adolescents can inform efforts by parents, school and program administrators, and public health officials to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission. To assess school, community, and close contact exposures associated with pediatric COVID-19, a case-control study was conducted to compare exposures reported by parents or guardians of children and adolescents aged <18 years with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing (case-patients) with exposures reported among those who received negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results (control participants). Among 397 children and adolescents investigated, in-person school or child care attendance &#8804;14 days before the SARS-CoV-2 test was reported for 62% of case-patients and 68% of control participants and was not associated with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.5-1.3). Among 236 children aged &#8805;2 years who attended child care or school during the 2 weeks before SARS-CoV-2 testing, parents of 64% of case-patients and 76% of control participants reported that their child and all staff members wore masks inside the facility (aOR = 0.4, 95% CI = 0.2-0.8). In the 2 weeks preceding SARS-CoV-2 testing, case-patients were more likely to have had close contact with a person with known COVID-19 (aOR = 3.2, 95% CI = 2.0-5.0), have attended gatherings with persons outside their household, including social functions (aOR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.1-5.5) or activities with other children (aOR = 3.3, 95% CI = 1.3-8.4), or have had visitors in the home (aOR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.2-2.9) than were control participants. Close contacts with persons with COVID-19 and gatherings contribute to SARS-CoV-2 infections in children and adolescents. Consistent use of masks, social distancing, isolation of infected persons, and quarantine of those who are exposed to the virus continue to be important to prevent COVID-19 spread.","Hobbs, Charlotte V; Martin, Lora M; Kim, Sara S; Kirmse, Brian M; Haynie, Lisa; McGraw, Sarah; Byers, Paul; Taylor, Kathryn G; Patel, Manish M; Flannery, Brendan",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,597

Here, we identify genes associated with CCV alterations in ASD by performing spatial correlations between the gene expression of 6 donated brains and neuroimaging data from 1,404 ASD patients and 1,499 controls. Based on spatial correlations between gene expression and CCV differences from two independent meta-analyses and between gene expression and individual CCV distributions of 404 patients and 496 controls, we identify 417 genes associated with both CCV differences and individual CCV distributions. These genes are enriched for genetic association signals and genes downregulated in the ASD post-mortem brain. The expression patterns of these genes are correlated with brain activation patterns of language-related neural processes frequently impaired in ASD. These findings highlight a model whereby genetic risk impacts gene expression (downregulated), which leads to CCV alterations in ASD.","Xie, Yingying; Zhang, Xue; Liu, Feng; Qin, Wen; Fu, Jilian; Xue, Kaizhong; Yu, Chunshui",Cell Rep,,597

For example, emerging evidence strongly suggests that incidence and case fatality rates are higher among Blacks than Whites.1 Immigrants are among the groups most likely to experience disproportionate effects from COVID-19. Unlike race/ethnicity, however, nativity and citizenship status are not included on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) coronavirus case report form,2 so data regarding testing and spread across immigrant groups are likely to remain scarce. Information from other health and social surveys-including data that I present in Table 1-suggest that noncitizens experience barriers to physical distancing that will place them at high risk of contracting COVID-19 and have high levels of disadvantage that leave them vulnerable to its economic effects. I recommend three policy changes to address the high health and economic risk among noncitizens, goals that are in the best interest of public health and the broader economy. (Am J Public Health.

249127,Well-Being During a Time of Crisis and Beyond: Supporting a Culture of Mindfulness in Oncology Practices,2020,"Testing and case identification are key strategies in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Contact tracing and isolation are only possible if cases have been identified. The effectiveness of testing should be assessed, but a single comprehensive metric is not available to assess testing effectiveness, and no timely estimates of case detection rate are available globally, making inter-country comparisons difficult. The purpose of this paper was to propose a single, comprehensive metric, called the COVID-19 Testing Index (CovTI) scaled from 0 to 100, derived from epidemiological indicators of testing, and to identify factors associated with this outcome. The index was based on case-fatality rate, test positivity rate, active cases, and an estimate of the detection rate. It used parsimonious modeling to estimate the true total number of COVID-19 cases based on deaths, testing, health system capacity, and government transparency. Publicly reported data from 165 countries and territories that had reported at least 100 confirmed cases by June 3, 2020 were included in the index. Estimates of detection rates aligned satisfactorily with previous estimates in literature (R2 = 0.44). As of June 3, 2020, the states with the highest CovTI included Hong Kong (93.7), Australia (93.5), Iceland (91.8), Cambodia (91.3), New Zealand (90.6), Vietnam (90.2), and Taiwan (89.9). Bivariate analyses showed the mean CovTI in countries with open public testing policies (66.9, 95% CI 61.0-72.8) was significantly higher than in countries with no testing policy (29.7, 95% CI 17.6-41.9) (p<0.0001). A multiple linear regression model assessed the association of independent grouping variables with CovTI. Open public testing and extensive contact tracing were shown to significantly increase CovTI, after adjusting for extrinsic factors, including geographic isolation and centralized forms of government. The correlation of testing and contact tracing policies with improved outcomes demonstrates the validity of this model to assess testing effectiveness and also suggests these policies were effective at improving health outcomes. This tool can be combined with other databases to identify other factors or may be useful as a standalone tool to help inform policymakers.","Kuster, Anthony C; Overgaard, Hans J",PLoS One,,597

Orv Hetil. 2021; 162(16): 611-614. Summary. Mortality of COVID-19 is increased when certain co-morbidities, among others advanced malignancies are present. Deleterious effect of cytotoxic therapy, related to its immunosuppressive effect, may also be hypothesised. However, postponing or cancelling oncologic treatment, especially in younger patients with advanced and more aggressive tumors may worsen the prognosis. The case of a 39-year-old female patient is presented, who was diagnosed with loco-regionally advanced breast cancer during the pandemic. Primary systemic chemotherapy was started. The patient presented with acute respiratory tract symptoms during the fifth cycle and subsequently SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed. Chemotherapy was cancelled. Symptoms resolved in three days after diagnosis. SARS-CoV-2 PCR remained positive up to day 43. Antihormonal therapy was introduced on day 19 and she underwent mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection on day 51. Chemotherapy was reset postoperatively on day 82 with prophylactic G-CSF protection. No adverse event was observed throughout the treatment. Cytotoxic chemotherapy and surgery can be successfully delivered in breast cancer patients with prolonged asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity, even without negative swab result. Individual optimisation of the therapy may require deviations from standard protocols. Closer multidisciplinary cooperation may contribute to the minimisation of both oncologic and infectious risks.

Lately, scientific evidence has been growing about the measures for reopening respiratory outpatient services during the COVID-19 pandemic. We aim to summarize the key differences and similarities among recommendations by different national and international organizations. METHODS: We searched on Google and Pubmed for recently published National and International Recommendations/Guidelines/Position Papers from professional organizations and societies, offering a guidance to physicians on how to safely perform pulmonary function testing during COVID-19 pandemic. We also searched for spirometry manufacturers' operational indications. RESULTS: Indications on spirometry were released by the Chinese Task force, the American Thoracic Society, the European Respiratory Society, the Thoracic Society of Australia and New Zealand, the Société de Pneumologie de Langue Française, the Spanish Societies (Sociedad Espanola de Neumologia y Cirugia Toracica, Sociedad Espanola de Alergologia e Inmunologia Clinica, Asociacion de Especialistas en Enfermeria del trabajo, Asociacion de Enfermeria Comunitaria), the Sociedade Portuguesa de Pneumologia, the British Thoracic Society/Association for Respiratory Technology & Physiology, the Irish Thoracic Society, the Sociedad Uruguaya de Neumologia, the Italian Thoracic Society and the Italian Respiratory Society, Cleveland Clinic and Nebraska Medical Center. Detailed technical recommendations were found on manufacturers' websites. We found several similarities across available guidelines for safely resuming pulmonary function services, as well as differences in criteria for selecting eligible patients for which spirometry is deemed essential and advice which was not homogenous on room ventilation precautions. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows a synthesis of national/international guidelines allowing practicing physicians to adapt and shape the way to organize their outpatient services locally. There is generally good agreement on the importance of limiting pulmonary function testing to selected cases only. However, significant differences concerning the subsets of candidate patients, as well as on the management of adequate room ventilation, were observed.","Crimi, Claudia; Impellizzeri, Pietro; Campisi, Raffaele; Nolasco, Santi; Spanevello, Antonio; Crimi, Nunzio","Pulmonology (Barc., Print)",,597

We reviewed and graded the research evidence with potential clinical application. We conducted a modified Delphi consensus among experienced colonoscopists on definitions and practice of WI, WE and UWR. METHODS: Major data bases were searched to obtain research reports that could potentially shape clinical practice related to WAC and UWR. Pertinent references were graded (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation). Extracted data supporting evidence-based Statements were tabulated and provided to respondents. We received responses from 55 (85% surveyed) experienced colonoscopists (37 experts and 18 nonexperts in WAC) from 16 countries in 3 rounds. Voting was conducted anonymously in the second and third round, with &#8805;80% agreement defined as consensus. We aimed to obtain consensus in all Statements. RESULTS: In the first and the second modified Delphi rounds, 20 proposed statements were decreased to 14 then 11 statements. After the third round, the combined responses from all respondents depicted the consensus in 11 Statements (S): definitions of WI (S1) and WE (S2), procedural features (S3-S5), impact on bowel cleanliness (S6), adenoma detection (S7), pain score (S8), and UWR (S9- S11).

251071,The Joint Commission should reconsider its position on virtual monitoring of suicide risk,2020,"BACKGROUND: The UK has been one of the European countries most affected by COVID-19 pandemic The UK implemented a lockdown in March 2020, when testing policy at the time was focusing on hospitalised cases Limited information is therefore available on the impact of the lockdown on point prevalence in the community We assessed COVID-19 point prevalence in London between early April and early May 2020, which approximately reflect infection around the time of the lockdown and 3-5 weeks into lockdown METHODS: We tested 1064 participants of a community surveillance cohort for acute COVID-19 infection using PCR in London in April and May 2020 and described positivity as well as characteristics and symptoms of the participants RESULTS: Point prevalence decreased from 2 2% (95% CI 1 4 to 3 5) in early April to 0 2% (95% CI 0 03 to 1 6) in early May 22% of those who tested positive in April were asymptomatic Extrapolation from reports of confirmed cases suggest that 5-7 6% of total infections were confirmed by testing during this period CONCLUSION: COVID-19 point prevalence in the community sharply decreased after lockdown was implemented This study is based on a small sample and regular seroprevalence studies are needed to better characterise population-level immunity","Edelstein, M.; Obi, C.; Chand, M.; Hopkins, S.; Brown, K.; Ramsay, M.",J Epidemiol Community Health,,597
251239,Morbidity and mortality trends of Covid 19 in top 10 countries,2020,"OBJECTIVES: A subset of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients exhibit clinical features of cytokine storm. However, clinicopathologic features diagnostic of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) have not been reported. We studied the reticuloendothelial organs of 4 consecutive patients who died of COVID-19 and correlated with clinical and laboratory parameters to detect HLH. METHODS: Autopsies were performed on 4 patients who died of COVID-19. Routine H&E staining and immunohistochemical staining for CD163 were performed to detect hemophagocytosis. Clinical and laboratory results from premortem blood samples were used to calculate H-scores. RESULTS: All 4 cases demonstrated diffuse alveolar damage within the lungs. Three of the 4 cases had histologic evidence of hemophagocytosis within pulmonary lymph nodes. One case showed hemophagocytosis in the spleen but none showed hemophagocytosis in liver or bone marrow. Lymphophagocytosis was the predominant form of hemophagocytosis observed. One patient showed diagnostic features of HLH with an H-score of 217, while a second patient likely had HLH with a partial H-score of 145 due to a missing triglyceride level. The remaining 2 patients had H-scores of 131 and 96. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-associated HLH. Identification of HLH in a subset of patients with severe COVID-19 will inform clinical trials of therapeutic strategies.","Prilutskiy, Andrey; Kritselis, Michael; Shevtsov, Artem; Yambayev, Ilyas; Vadlamudi, Charitha; Zhao, Qing; Kataria, Yachana; Sarosiek, Shayna R; Lerner, Adam; Sloan, J Mark; Quillen, Karen; Burks, Eric J",Am J Clin Pathol,,597

Although rare, improper technique when performing nasopharyngeal swabs has the potential to lead to injury or misleading test results. We present a case of uncontrolled epistaxis requiring hospitalization following a routine nasopharyngeal swab in a healthy patient. Both the complexity and variability of the anatomy of the nasopharynx can contribute to poor swabbing technique. Otolaryngologists should be encouraged to educate and support other healthcare workers to improve the yield and reduce the risk of harm due to nasopharyngeal swabs. Increased comfort levels with performing nasopharyngeal swabs will also improve the sensitivity of screening tests for common respiratory viruses such as influenza, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), or bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus.","Liu, Mark Roychowdhury Prithwijit Ito Christopher J.",Otolaryngology Case Reports,,597

The framework is motivated by interactive robotic applications found in warehouses, construction sites and additive manufacturing, where a mobile robot manipulates objects in the scene. The proposed framework uses a novel dynamic Gaussian Process (GP) Implicit Surface method to incrementally build and update the scene map that reflects environment changes. Actively the framework provides the next-best-view (NBV), balancing the need of pick object reach-ability and map's information gain (IG). To enforce a priority of visiting boundary segments over unknown regions, the IG formulation includes an uncertainty gradient based frontier score by exploiting the GP kernel derivative. This leads to an efficient strategy that addresses the often conflicting requirement of unknown environment exploration and object picking exploitation given a limited execution horizon. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework with software simulation and real-life experiments.","Liu, Liyang; Fryc, Simon; Wu, Lan; Vu, Thanh; Paul, Gavin; Vidal-Calleja, Teresa",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.13108v1.pdf,597

Since then, cases in South Africa have increased exponentially with significant community transmission. A multisectoral approach to containing and mitigating the spread of SARS-CoV-2 was instituted, led by the South African National Department of Health. A National COVID-19 Command Council was established to take government-wide decisions. An adapted World Health Organiszion (WHO) COVID-19 strategy for containing and mitigating the spread of the virus was implemented by the National Department of Health. The strategy included the creation of national and provincial incident management teams (IMTs), which comprised of a variety of work streams, namely, governance and leadership; medical supplies; port and environmental health; epidemiology and response; facility readiness and case management; emergency medical services; information systems; risk communication and community engagement; occupational health and safety and human resources. The following were the most salient lessons learnt between March and September 2020: strengthened command and control were achieved through both centralised and decentralised IMTs; swift evidenced-based decision-making from the highest political levels for instituting lockdowns to buy time to prepare the health system; the stringent lockdown enabled the health sector to increase its healthcare capacity. Despite these successes, the stringent lockdown measures resulted in economic hardship particularly for the most vulnerable sections of the population.","Moonasar, Devanand; Pillay, Anban; Leonard, Elizabeth; Naidoo, Raveen; Mngemane, Shadrack; Ramkrishna, Wayne; Jamaloodien, Khadija; Lebese, Lebogang; Chetty, Kamy; Bamford, Lesley; Tanna, Gaurang; Ntuli, Nhlanhla; Mlisana, Koleka; Madikizela, Lindiwe; Modisenyane, Moeketsi; Engelbrecht, Christie; Maja, Popo; Bongweni, Funeka; Furumele, Tsakani; Mayet, Natalie; Goga, Ameena; Talisuna, Ambrose; Ramadan, Otim Patrick Cossy; Pillay, Yogan",,,597
252396,Intriguing New Faces Of Covid-19: Persisting Clinical Symptoms And Cardiac Effects in Children,2021,"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has compelled a majority of hospital systems to reduce surgical and procedural volumes in an attempt to preserve resources. Elective surgery and procedures (ESP) resumption has proven to be a calculated risk between COVID-19 exposure and resource depletion and patient morbidity and mortality from surgical deferral. Methods: Within a few days of halting ESP, our 7-hospital (2427 in-patient beds, 26,647 inpatient surgeries) healthcare system developed a multidisciplinary Pivot Plan with the primary outcome of a phased resumption of ESP. The plan entailed the integration of our electronic medical record, order entry automatization, perioperative staff utilization, partnering with primary care providers, and a step-wise COVID-19 testing algorithm based on a pre-determined hierarchy of case acuity and timeliness of patient care. Results: The Pivot Plan was instituted on May 10, 2020. Since then, 22,624 patients have been tested for COVID-19 in anticipation of an ESP; 140 (0.62%) tested positive for COVID-19 and had their procedure deferred. As our testing capability has increased, we have been able to increase our added ESP capacity from 13 cases per day to 531 cases per day. In turn, we have seen the case volume increase by 52%. Conclusion: Our academic healthcare system located in one of the initial COVID - 19 hotspots in the United States has successfully resumed ESP in part due to a receptive and supportive culture, based upon nimbleness, agility, and rapid integration of multiple resources from a cohort of diverse disciplines applied to the perioperative services workflow.","Serrano, Oscar K; Orlando, Rocco; Papasavas, Pavlos; McClure, Mitchell H; Kumar, Ajay; Steinberg, Adam C; Cohen, Jeffrey L; Shichman, Steven J; Singh, Rekhinder K; Sardella, William V; Schipper, Bret M",,,597

Treatment and evolution in octogenarians are not well defined. Our objective is to describe its clinical characteristics, the treatments and its clinical evolution. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Retrospective observational study of consecutive patients admitted in the period between March 23 and April 12, 2020 with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, with pneumonia by radiological study or chest tomography, whith STC criteria and who received treatment. We classified patients as those who received only glucocorticoid (GC) pulses, or GC and tocilizumab pulses. We determined serum levels of ferritin, CRP and D-dimers. The final variable was survival. RESULTS: 21 patients, (80-88 years). The mean ferritin was 1056 microg/L (317-3,553), CRP 115.8mg/dL (22-306) and D-dimers 2.9m/L (0.45-17.5). All patients received GC pulses and in 2 cases simultaneously tocilizumab. The mean follow-up time was 13.7 days (8-21). The overall mortality was 38.1% (8/21 patients). The 2 patients who received tocilizumab died. The deceased had significantly higher levels of ferritin (1,254 vs. 925microg/L; P=.045) and CRP (197.6 vs. 76mg / dL; P=.007). At the end of the follow-up, a decrease in the biochemical parameters was observed with ferritin of 727microg/L, CRP of 27mg/dl and D-dimers of 1.18mg/L. In 13/21 patients (61.9%), the CTS was controlled without the need to add other treatments. CONCLUSIONS: STC mortality from SARS-CoV-2 is high despite treatment. A greater inflammatory response was associated with a higher mortality. Although it seems that the early use of GC pulses could control it, and the use of other treatments such as tocilizumab shouldo be, with the study design and its limitations, this conclusion cannot be stablished.","Callejas Rubio, José Luis; Aomar Millán, Ismael; Moreno Higueras, Manuela; Muñoz Medina, Leopoldo; López López, María; Ceballos Torres, Ángel",Rev Esp Geriatr Gerontol,,597

We conducted an online search in Medline/PubMed to identify original cohorts comparing data between survivors and non-survivors from COVID-19. The presence of cardiovascular events and related biomarkers were compared between the 2 groups. Data on 1,845 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were pooled from 12 comparative studies. The overall mortality rate in relation to COVID-19 was 17.6%. Men aged > 50 years old were more likely to die from COVID-19. Significant co-morbidities contributing to mortality were hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, a previous history of cardiovascular disease including chronic heart failure, and cerebrovascular accidents. A significant relationship was observed between mortality and patient presentation with dyspnea, fatigue, tachycardia, and hypoxemia. Cardiovascular disease-related laboratory biomarkers related to mortality were elevated serum level of lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, brain natriuretic peptide, and cardiac troponin I. Adverse cardiovascular disease-related clinical events preceding death were shock, arrhythmias, and acute myocardial injury. In conclusion, severe clinical presentation and elevated biomarkers in COVID-19 patients with established risk factors can predict mortality from cardiovascular causes.","Shoar, Saeed; Hosseini, Fatemeh; Naderan, Mohammad; Mehta, Jawahar L",Am J Cardiol,,597

Herbal medicines and their derived natural products have drawn much attention in the treatment of COVID-19, but the detailed mechanisms by which natural products inhibit SARS-CoV-2 have not been elucidated. Here, we show that platycodin D (PD), a triterpenoid saponin abundant in Platycodon grandiflorum (PG), a dietary and medicinal herb commonly used in East Asia, effectively blocks the two main SARS-CoV-2 infection routes via lysosome- and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2)-driven entry. Mechanistically, PD prevents host entry of SARS-CoV-2 by redistributing membrane cholesterol to prevent membrane fusion, which can be reinstated by treatment with a PD-encapsulating agent. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of PD are recapitulated by the pharmacological inhibition or gene silencing of NPC1, which is mutated in patients with Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) displaying disrupted membrane cholesterol distribution. Finally, readily available local foods or herbal medicines containing PG root show similar inhibitory effects against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our study proposes that PD is a potent natural product for preventing or treating COVID-19 and that briefly disrupting the distribution of membrane cholesterol is a potential novel therapeutic strategy for SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Kim, Tai Young; Jeon, Sangeun; Jang, Youngho; Gotina, Lizaveta; Won, Joungha; Ju, Yeon Ha; Kim, Sunpil; Jang, Minwoo Wendy; Won, Woojin; Park, Mingu Gordon; Pae, Ae Nim; Han, Sunkyu; Kim, Seungtaek; Lee, C Justin",Exp. mol. med,,597

Given these functional data, we explore the modes of variation in the data using functional principal component analysis (FPCA). We also apply functional clustering analysis to identify patterns of COVID-19 confirmed case and death trajectories across the US. Moreover, we quantify the associations between Google COVID-19 search trends for symptoms and COVID-19 confirmed case and death trajectories using dynamic correlation. Finally, we examine the dynamics of correlations for the top nine Google search trends of symptoms commonly associated with COVID-19 confirmed case and death trajectories. Our results reveal and characterize distinct patterns for COVID-19 spread and mortality across the US. The dynamics of these correlations suggest the feasibility of using Google queries to forecast COVID-19 cases and mortality for up to three weeks in advance.

However, conventional learning (CL) has cost, time, and space constraints. This study aimed to evaluate whether laypersons who completed instructor-led distance learning (DL) acquired a level of CPR skill comparable to that achieved via CL training. METHODS: This randomized controlled study recruited students from 28 Korean high schools who were randomized to complete instructor-led DL or CL training. The CL training involved classroom-based face-to-face training, whereas the instructor-led DL training was provided online using a videoconferencing system. RESULTS: The study enrolled 62 students who were randomized to the CL group (31 participants) or the DL group (31 participants). Relative to the CL group, the DL group achieved remarkably similar results in terms of most CPR variables. In addition, the DL group had a significant improvement in the mean compression depth (before: 46 mm [interquartile range: 37-52 mm] vs. after: 49 mm [interquartile range: 46-54 mm], p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Instructor-led DL can be a suitable alternative to CL for providing CPR training to laypersons. In settings like the current COVID-19 pandemic, where face-to-face CL is not practical, DL may be a useful tool for delivering CPR training.","Han, Sangsoo; Park, Hye Ji; Nah, Sangun; Lee, Eun Hae; Lee, Hyun Ji; Park, Ju Ok; Lee, Choung Ah",PLoS One,,597

Effective treatment for COVID-19 is urgently needed. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the antiviral effect of Arbidol vs. Chloroquine in treating COVID-19. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 62 patients with COVID-19 diagnosed according to the guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 in China. They were divided into two groups depending on the antiviral drugs that they received. Participants in the Arbidol group (n=42) received 0.2 g Arbidol, tid for 10 days,and those in Chloroquine group (n=20) received 500 mg Chloroquine, bid for 10 days. The coronavirus negative conversion time and the length of hospital stay were analyzed and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in demographic and clinical characteristics between the two groups. After antiviral treatment, the nasopharyngeal specimen negative conversion time of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the length of hospital stay in the Arbidol group were significantly shorter than those in the Chloroquine group (18.50 vs. 25.05 days, P=0.001; 23.52 vs. 28.75 days, P=0.001). Adverse events observed during the antiviral treatment period were comparable between the two groups. Overall, 3 (7.14%) participants in the Arbidol group and 4 (20.0%) in the Chloroquine group experienced adverse events during antiviral treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that Arbidol is advantageous over Chloroquine in terms of the SARS-CoV-2 negative conversion and the length of hospital stay in treating COVID-19 patients.","Li, Ming; Yu, Tongya; Zhu, Jinghua; Wang, Yinjia; Yang, Yanxia; Zhao, Kaiwu; Yi, Yongning; He, Juan; Li, Chao; He, Jian",Ann Palliat Med,,597

259463,Convergence between global BCG vaccination and COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"PURPOSE: Currently, there are about 15 ongoing clinical studies on low dose radiation therapy for Coronavirus Disease 2019 pneumonia. One of the underlying assumptions is that irradiation of 0.5 to 1.5 Gy is effective at ameliorating viral pneumonia. We aimed to reanalyze all available experimental radiobiologic data to assess evidence for such amelioration. METHODS AND MATERIALS: With standard statistical survival models, and based on a systematic literature review, we reanalyzed 13 radiobiologic animal data sets published in 1937 to 1973 in which animals (guinea pigs/dogs/cats/rats/mice) received radiation before or after bacterial or viral inoculation, and assessing various health endpoints (mortality/pneumonia morbidity). In most data sets absorbed doses did not exceed 7 Gy. RESULTS: For 6 studies evaluating postinoculation radiation exposure (more relevant to low dose radiation therapy for Coronavirus Disease 2019 pneumonia) the results are heterogeneous, with one study showing a significant increase (P < .001) and another showing a significant decrease (P < .001) in mortality associated with radiation exposure. Among the remaining 4 studies, mortality risk was nonsignificantly increased in 2 studies and nonsignificantly decreased in 2 others (P > .05). For preinoculation exposure the results are also heterogeneous, with 6 (of 8) data sets showing a significant increase (P < .01) in mortality risk associated with radiation exposure and the other 2 showing a significant decrease (P < .05) in mortality or pneumonitis morbidity risk. CONCLUSIONS: These data do not provide support for reductions in morbidity or mortality associated with postinfection radiation exposure. For preinfection radiation exposure the inconsistency of direction of effect is difficult to interpret. One must be cautious about adducing evidence from such published reports of old animal data sets.","Little, Mark P; Zhang, Wei; van Dusen, Roy; Hamada, Nobuyuki",Int. j. radiat. oncol. biol. phys,,597
259559,Major cardiac concerns in therapy and vaccinations for COVID-19,2021,"Even though the early reports from China provided advance warning of what was to come, the COVID-19 pandemic has spread throughout the world with devastating consequences. Emergency measures are being implemented to reduce the magnitude of the public health crisis, prevent healthcare facilities from becoming overwhelmed and reduce the death toll of the disease. Containment strategies to mitigate viral transmission and emergency measures to increase the capacity of each country to provide intensive care are at the forefront of the public health management of the epidemic, even though the detrimental social and psychological effects of quarantine are evident on a global scale. Optimal management of critically ill patients with COVID-19 is also unclear, and the initial suggestion for early intubation as in typical ARDS may have caused significant harm. The management of mild cases of confirmed infection is another point of controversy, as drugs which may be repurposed for COVID-19 treatment have significant, potentially irreversible toxic effects and their use in mild cases of a viral illness which is typically self-limited may be harmful.","Zareifopoulos, Nicholas; Lagadinou, Maria; Karela, Anastasia; Platanaki, Christina; Karantzogiannis, Gerasimos; Velissaris, Dimitrios",Monaldi arch. chest dis,,597

Furthermore, the world health organization (WHO) has announced that COVID-19 has reached the global epidemic stage. Early and reliable diagnosis using chest CT-scan can assist medical specialists in vital circumstances. In this work, we introduce a computer aided diagnosis (CAD) web service to detect COVID- 19 online. One of the largest public chest CT-scan databases, containing 746 participants was used in this experiment. A number of well-known deep neural network architectures consisting of ResNet, Inception and MobileNet were inspected to find the most efficient model for the hybrid system. A combination of the Densely connected convolutional network (DenseNet) in order to reduce image dimensions and Nu-SVM as an anti-overfitting bottleneck was chosen to distinguish between COVID-19 and healthy controls. The proposed methodology achieved 90.80% recall, 89.76% precision and 90.61% accuracy. The method also yields an AUC of 95.05%. Ultimately a flask web service is made public through ngrok using the trained models to provide a RESTful COVID-19 detector, which takes only 39 milliseconds to process one image. The source code is also available at https://github.com/KiLJ4EdeN/COVID_WEB. Based on the findings, it can be inferred that it is feasible to use the proposed technique as an automated tool for diagnosis of COVID-19.","Saeedi, Abdolkarim; Saeedi, Maryam; Maghsoudi, Arash",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.14419v2.pdf,597

We investigated how musicians dealt with this sudden restriction in mobility. Responses of 234 people were collected. The majority of respondents (95%) resided in Belgium or the Netherlands. Results indicated a decrease of 79% of live music making in social settings during lockdown compared with before lockdown. In contrast, an increase of 264% was demonstrated for online joint music making. However, results showed that most respondents were largely or even completely unaccustomed with specialized platforms for online joint music making (e.g., JamKazam, Jamulus). Respondents reported to mostly use well-known video-conferencing platforms such as Zoom and Skype when playing together virtually. However, when such video-conferencing platforms were used, they were often not employed for synchronized playing and were generally reported to insufficiently deal with latency issues. Furthermore, respondents depending on music making as their main source of income explored online real-time methods significantly more than those relying on other income sources. Results also demonstrated an increase of 93% in the use of alternative remote joint music-making methods (e.g., recording parts separately and subsequently circulating these digital recordings). All in all, results of this study provide a more in-depth view on joint music making during the first weeks of lockdown induced by the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, and demonstrate users' perceptions of performance and usability of online real-time platforms as well as alternative methods for musical interaction.","Onderdijk, K.

We present a COVID-19 patient with refractory acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS), and life-threatening PE who underwent successful thrombolysis. CASE PRESENTATION: A previously healthy 47 year old male was admitted to our hospital due to severe COVID-19 pneumonia [confirmed by Real-Time-Polymerase-Chain-Reaction (RT-PCR)]. He had rapidly evolving ARDS [partial arterial pressure of oxygen to fractional inspired concentration of oxygen ratio: 175], and sepsis. Laboratory results showed lymphocytopenia, and increased D-dimer levels (7.7 µg/ml; normal: 0-0.5 µg/ml). The patient was treated in the intensive care unit. On day-1, ARDS-net/prone positioning ventilation, and empiric anti-COVID treatment integrating prophylactic anticoagulation was administered. On hospital day-2, the patient developed shock with worsening oxygenation. Point-of-care-ultrasound depicted a large thrombus migrating from the right atrium to the pulmonary circulation. Intravenous alteplase (100 mg over 2 h) was administered as rescue therapy. The patient made an uneventful recovery, and was discharged to home isolation (day-20) on oral rivaroxaban. CONCLUSION: Thrombolysis may have a critical therapeutic role for massive PE in COVID-19; however the risk of potential bleeding should not be underestimated. Point-of-care ultrasound has a pivotal role in the management of refractory ARDS in COVID-19.","Alharthy, Abdulrahman; Faqihi, Fahad; Papanikolaou, John; Balhamar, Abdullah; Blaivas, Mike; Memish, Ziad A; Karakitsos, Dimitrios",Am. j. emerg. med,,597

An imaging study with objective clinical correlation is needed in COVID-19 anosmia in order to better understand underlying pathogenesis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We evaluated 23 patients with persistent COVID-19 olfactory dysfunction. Patients included in this study had a minimum 1-month duration between onset of olfactory dysfunction and evaluation. Olfactory functions were evaluated with Sniffin' Sticks Test. Paranasal sinus CTs and MRI dedicated to olfactory nerves were acquired. On MRI, quantitative measurements of olfactory bulb volumes and olfactory sulcus depth and qualitative assessment of olfactory bulb morphology, signal intensity, and olfactory nerve filia architecture were performed. RESULTS: All patients were anosmic at the time of imaging based on olfactory test results. On CT, Olfactory cleft opacification was seen in 73.9% of cases with a mid and posterior segment dominance. 43.5% of cases had below normal olfactory bulb volumes and 60.9% of cases had shallow olfactory sulci. Of all, 54.2% of cases had changes in normal inverted J shape of the bulb. 91.3% of cases had abnormality in olfactory bulb signal intensity in the forms of diffusely increased signal intensity, scattered hyperintense foci or microhemorrhages. Evident clumping of olfactory filia was seen in 34.8% of cases and thinning with scarcity of filia in 17.4%. Primary olfactory cortical signal abnormality was seen in 21.7% of cases. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate olfactory cleft and olfactory bulb abnormalities are seen in COVID-19 anosmia. There was a relatively high percentage of olfactory bulb degeneration. Further longitudinal imaging studies could shed light on the mechanism of olfactory neuronal pathway injury in COVID-19 anosmia.","Kandemirli, Sedat Giray; Altundag, Aytug; Yildirim, Duzgun; Tekcan Sanli, Deniz Esin; Saatci, Ozlem",Acad Radiol,,597

METHODS: A total of 122 subjects with COVID-19 were included: 106 SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR-positive patients and 16 RT-PCR-negative patients with symptoms and chest computed tomography (CT) consistent with COVID-19. Ninety-six historical blood donation samples were used as controls. Demographic and clinical characteristics were retrieved from electronic records. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated, as were their 95% binomial confidence intervals using the Clopper-Pearson method. All analyses were performed in R version 3.6.3. RESULTS: The sensitivity of the chromatographic immunoassay in all RT-PCR-positive patients, irrespective of the timing of symptom onset, was 85.8% (95% binomial CI 77.7% to 91.9%). This increased with time after symptom onset, and at >14 days was 94.9% (85.9% to 98.9%). The specificity was 100% (96.4% to 100%). 15/16 (94%) RT- PCR-negative cases tested positive. The most frequent comorbidities were hypertension and diabetes mellitus and the most frequent symptoms were fever, cough, and dyspnea. All RT-PCR-negative patients had pneumonia.

After temporarily closing, many educators quickly adapted their procedures to ensure children's safety as they reopened to provide childcare for essential workers and then the community at large. This manuscript reports on statewide efforts to continue quality improvement initiatives for early childhood programs amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. We first describe the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic for over 2000 educators-teachers, administrators, and specialists-who completed surveys in the Spring and Fall of 2020. These survey data come from a statewide system called the Texas Early Childhood Professional Development System (TECPDS), designed to track the professional development needs/progress of early childhood educators. Second, we describe an example of how a statewide professional development and quality improvement program shifted to remote delivery during the pandemic. As an increasing number of educators turn to virtual training resources, we explain lessons learned from these response efforts and how they can inform future virtual professional development efforts, even amidst crisis, to ensure that a focus on quality improvement continues while supporting teachers' individual needs.","Crawford, April; Vaughn, Kelly A; Guttentag, Cathy L; Varghese, Cheryl; Oh, Yoonkyung; Zucker, Tricia A",Early Child Educ J,,597

261772,Forecasting daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in Malaysia using ARIMA models,2020,"Most industrial trucks are equipped with hydraulic systems designed for specific operations, for which the required power is supplied by the internal combustion engine (ICE). The largest share of the power consumption is required by the hydraulic system during idling operations, and, consequently, the current literature focuses on energy saving strategies for the hydraulic system rather than making the vehicle traction more efficient. This study presents the preliminary realization of an electric-powered hydraulic pump system (e-HPS) that drives the lifting of the dumpster and the garbage compaction in a waste compactor truck, rather than traditional ICE-driven hydraulic pump systems (ICE-HPSs). The different components of the e-HPS are described and the battery pack was modelled using the kinetic battery model. The end-of-life of the battery pack was determined to assess the economic feasibility of the proposed e-HPS for the truck lifespan, using numerical simulations. The aim was twofold: to provide an implementation method to retrofit the e-HPS to a conventional waste compactor truck and to assess its economic feasibility, investigating fuel savings during the use phase and the consequent reduction of CO2 emissions. Results show that the total lifespan cost saving achieved a value of 65,000 €. Furthermore, total CO2 emissions for the e-HPS were about 80% lower than those of the ICE-HPS, highlighting that the e-HPS can provide significant environmental benefits in an urban context.","De Santis, Michele Silvestri Luca Forcina Antonio Gianpaolo Di Bona Di Fazio Anna Rita",Applied Sciences,,597

262337,Altered regional cerebral glucose metabolism and its correlation with cognitive impairment in the subacute stage of COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Computed tomography (CT) is the preferred imaging technique for the evaluation of COVID-19 pneumonia. However, it is not suitable as a monitoring tool for pregnant women because of the risk of ionizing radiation damage to the fetus as well as the possible infection of others. In this study, we explored the value of bedside lung ultrasound (LUS) as an alternative to CT for the detection and monitoring of lung involvement in pregnant women with COVID-19. METHODS: Clinical and LUS data of 39 pregnant women with COVID-19 were retrospectively reviewed. All LUS and CT images were analyzed to summarize the findings and calculate LUS scores and CT scores for each patient. LUS findings were compared with CT, and correlation between LUS scores and CT scores was evaluated. RESULTS: Among the 39 pregnant women, there were 6 mild-type cases, 29 common-type cases, 4 severe-type cases, and no critical-type cases. The most common LUS findings of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were various grades of multiple B-lines (84.6%), thickened and irregular pleural lines (71.8%), pleural effusion (61.5%) and small multifocal consolidation limited to the subpleural space (35.9%). The mean LUS score at admission was 0 points in mild-type cases, 10.6 points in common-type cases and 15.3 points in severe-type cases (P < 0.01). The correlation between LUS scores and CT was 0.793. All patients were clinically cured and each underwent an average of three LUS follow-ups during hospitalization. The mean LUS score at discharge was 5.6 points lower than that at admission. The consistency of LUS and chest CT during follow-up was 0.652. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative LUS scoring can effectively instead of CT for detecting and monitoring of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women and protect fetuses from the risk of ionizing radiation.","Deng, Qing; Cao, Sheng; Wang, Hao; Zhang, Yao; Chen, Liao; Yang, Zhaohui; Peng, Zhoufeng; Zhou, Qing",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,,597

There is emerging evidence of SARS-CoV-2 virus found in the blood of patients from China and some developed countries. However, there is inadequate data reported in Ghana and other parts of Africa, where blood transfusion service heavily relies on voluntary and replacement blood donors. This study aimed to investigate whether plasma of infected individuals could pose significant transfusion transmitted risk of COVID-19 in Ghanaian populations. METHODS: This cross-sectional retrospective study was conducted at the Kumasi Centre for Collaborative Research into Tropical Medicine (KCCR), KNUST, Ghana. Study subjects comprised contacts of COVID-19 individuals, those with classical symptoms of COVID-19 and individuals who had recovered based on the new Ghana discharge criteria. Whole blood, sputum or deep coughed saliva samples were collected and transported to KCCR for SARS-CoV-2 testing. Viral nucleic acid was extracted from sputum/nasopharyngeal samples using Da An Gene column based kit and from plasma using LBP nucleic acid extraction kit. Real-Time PCR was performed specifically targeting the ORF1ab and Nucleocapsid (N) genomic regions of the virus. RESULTS: A total of 97 individuals were recruited into the study, with more than half being males (58; 59.7%). The mean age of all subjects was 33 years (SD = 7.7) with minimum being 22 years and maximum 56 years. Majority (76; 78.4%) of all the subjects were asymptomatic, and among the few symptomatic subjects, cough (10; 10.3%) was the most predominant symptom. Of the 97 sputum samples tested, 79 (81.4%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. We identified SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in the plasma of 1 (1.03%) subject who had clinically recovered. CONCLUSION: This study reports the identification of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in a convalescent individual in Ghana. Due to the low prevalence observed and the marginal cycling thresholds associated, the risk of transfusion transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is negligible. Well-powered studies and advanced diagnostics to determine infectious viremia is recommended to further evaluate the potential risk of hematogenous transmission among recovered patients.","Owusu, Michael; Sylverken, Augustina Angelina; El-Duah, Philip; Ayisi-Boateng, Nana Kwame; Yeboah, Richmond; Adu, Eric; Asamoah, Jesse; Frimpong, Michael; Senyo, Japhet; Acheampong, Godfred; Mutocheluh, Mohamed; Amuasi, John; Owusu-Dabo, Ellis; Adu-Sarkodie, Yaw; Phillips, Richard Odame",PLoS One,,597

These calculations are based on matrix elements of boosted hadrons coupled to non-local operators and can be related to the standard, light-cone distribution functions via an appropriate factorization formalism. There is significant progress in several directions, including calculations of flavor singlet parton distribution functions (PDFs), first calculations of generalized parton distributions (GPDs), as well as the implementation of some of the approaches for the transverse-momentum-dependent PDFs (TMD PDFs). This new direction of lattice calculations is particularly interesting for phenomenological fits on experimental data sets, as the lattice results can help to improve the constraints on the distribution functions.","Constantinou, Martha",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.02445v1.pdf,597

Approximately 80% of the infected patients are largely asymptomatic or have mild symptoms such as fever or cough, while rest of the patients display varying degrees of severity of symptoms, with an average mortality rate of 3-4%. Severe symptoms such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome may be caused by tissue damage, which is mostly due to aggravated and unresolved innate and adaptive immune response, often resulting from a cytokine storm. Here, we discuss how an intricate interplay among infected cells and cells of innate and adaptive immune system can lead to such diverse clinicopathological outcomes. Particularly, we discuss how the emergent nonlinear dynamics of interaction among the components of adaptive and immune system components and virally infected cells can drive different disease severity. Such minimalistic yet rigorous mathematical modeling approaches are helpful in explaining how various co-morbidity risk factors, such as age and obesity, can aggravate the severity of CoVID-19 in patients. Furthermore, such approaches can elucidate how a fine-tuned balance of infected cell killing and resolution of inflammation can lead to infection clearance, while disruptions can drive different severe phenotypes. These results can help further in a rational selection of drug combinations that can effectively balance viral clearance and minimize tissue damage.","Sahoo, Sarthak; Jhunjhunwala, Siddharth; Jolly, Mohit Kumar",J Indian Inst Sci,,597

The infection of SARS-CoV-2 in humans involves a viral surface glycoprotein named as spike proteins, which bind to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) proteins. Particularly, the receptor binding domains (RBDs) mediate the interaction and contain several disordered regions, which help in the binding. Investigations on the influence of disordered residues/regions in stability and binding of spike protein with ACE2 help to understand the disease pathogenesis, which has not yet been studied. In this study, we have used molecular-dynamics simulations to characterize the structural changes in disordered regions of the spike protein that result from ACE2 binding. We observed that the disordered regions undergo disorder-to-order transition (DOT) upon binding with ACE2, and the DOT residues are located at functionally important regions of RBD. Although the RBD is having rigid structure, DOT residues make conformational rearrangements for the spike protein to attach with ACE2. The binding is strengthened via hydrophilic and aromatic amino acids mainly present in the DOTs. The positively correlated motions of the DOT residues with its nearby residues also explain the binding profile of RBD with ACE2, and the residues are observed to be contributing more favorable binding energies for the spike-ACE2 complex formation. This study emphasizes that intrinsically disordered residues in the RBD of spike protein may provide insights into its etiology and be useful for drug and vaccine discovery.","Yesudhas, Dhanusha; Srivastava, Ambuj; Sekijima, Masakazu; Gromiha, M Michael",Proteins,,597

264539,Echo Training Post-COVID: Response from the National Board of Echocardiography,2020,"BACKGROUND: Understanding severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and transmission in educational settings is crucial for ensuring the safety of staff and children during the COVID-19 pandemic. We estimated the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection and outbreaks among staff and students in educational settings during the summer half-term (June-July, 2020) in England. METHODS: In this prospective, cross-sectional analysis, Public Health England initiated enhanced national surveillance in educational settings in England that had reopened after the first national lockdown, from June 1 to July 17, 2020. Educational settings were categorised as early years settings (<5-year-olds), primary schools (5-11-year-olds; only years 1 and 6 allowed to return), secondary schools (11-18-year-olds; only years 10 and 12), or mixed-age settings (spanning a combination of the above). Further education colleges were excluded. Data were recorded in HPZone, an online national database for events that require public health management. RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 event rates and case rates were calculated for staff and students, and direction of transmission was inferred on the basis of symptom onset and testing dates. Events were classified as single cases, coprimary cases (at least two confirmed cases within 48 h, typically within the same household), and outbreaks (at least two epidemiologically linked cases, with sequential cases diagnosed within 14 days in the same educational setting). All events were followed up for 28 days after educational settings closed for the summer holidays. Negative binomial regression was used to correlate educational setting events with regional population, population density, and community incidence. FINDINGS: A median of 38â000 early years settings (IQR 35â500-41â500), 15â600 primary schools (13â450-17â300), and 4000 secondary schools (3700-4200) were open each day, with a median daily attendance of 928â000 students (630â000-1â230â000) overall. There were 113 single cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, nine coprimary cases, and 55 outbreaks. The risk of an outbreak increased by 72% (95% CI 28-130) for every five cases per 100â000 population increase in community incidence (p<0·0001). Staff had higher incidence than students (27 cases [95% CI 23-32] per 100â000 per day among staff compared with 18 cases [14-24] in early years students, 6·0 cases [4·3-8·2] in primary schools students, and 6·8 cases [2·7-14] in secondary school students]), and most cases linked to outbreaks were in staff members (154 [73%] staff vs 56 [27%] children of 210 total cases). Probable direction of transmission was staff to staff in 26 outbreaks, staff to student in eight outbreaks, student to staff in 16 outbreaks, and student to student in five outbreaks. The median number of secondary cases in outbreaks was one (IQR 1-2) for student index cases and one (1-5) for staff index cases. INTERPRETATION: SARS-CoV-2 infections and outbreaks were uncommon in educational settings during the summer half-term in England. The strong association with regional COVID-19 incidence emphasises the importance of controlling community transmission to protect educational settings. Interventions should focus on reducing transmission in and among staff.

267370,Up in the Air? Future Research Strategies to Assess Aerosols in Dentistry,2021,"One of harm reduction's most salient features is its pragmatism. Harm reduction purports to distinguish itself from dominant prohibitionist and abstinence-based policy paradigms by being grounded in what is realistic, in contrast with the moralism or puritanism of prohibition and abstention. This is reflected in the meme ""harm reduction works"", popular both in institutional and grassroots settings. The idea that harm reduction is realistic and effective has meant different things among the main actors who seek to shape harm reduction policy. Drawing on scholarly literature about harm reduction, as well as examples from recent harm reduction advocacy efforts in relation to drug policy in Canada, this paper argues that harm reduction distinguishes itself through a unique ""way of knowing"". Grassroots harm reduction advocates, particularly as they argue through human rights frameworks, do more than simply make claims for the provision of particular services-like needle exchange, safe consumption sites, safe supply and the like-on the basis that these are realistic paths toward the health and well-being of people who use drugs. Rather, as they marshal lived experience in support of these policy changes through peer-driven initiatives in contexts of prohibition, they make particular claims about what constitute valid, methodologically rigorous evidence bases for action in contexts where policies to date have been driven by ideology and have developed in ways that have excluded and marginalized those most affected from policymaking. In doing so, they advocate for the centrality of people who use drugs not only in policy-making processes, but in evidence production itself.","Klein, Alana",Health care anal,,597

These variables were used to predict COVID-19 preventive health behaviors (PPE use), psychological distress, and physical symptoms. The surveys were completed between April 9, 2020 and April 18, 2020 which is a period that corresponded to the first 2-3 weeks of lockdown for most participants. A demographically diverse sample of participants was recruited. A substantial number of participants reported a reduction employment status and 69% were in self-isolation.Participants reported a high degree of perceived vulnerability to COVID-19. PPE mask wearing was variable: 16% ""not at all,"" 20% ""some of the time,"" 42% ""a good part of the time,"" and 26 ""most of the time."" Using clinical cutoff on the post-trauma scale, 70% of the sample would be considered to have symptoms consistent with PTSD. Physical symptom reporting was also high. Intolerance of uncertainty and psychological inflexibility were significant predictors of psychological distress and physical symptoms. Psychological flexibility moderated the relationship between intolerance of uncertainty and psychological distress/physical symptoms. The relationship between intolerance of uncertainty and psychological distress/physical symptoms was stronger among participants with lower levels of psychological flexibility. These findings indicate psychological flexibility can reduce distress associated with COVID-19. Additionally, these results support the workability of the Unified Flexibility and Mindfulness Model as a framework for studying health behavior.","O039,; Brien, William H; Wang, Shan; Varga, Aniko Viktoria; Xu, Huanzhen; Sims, Tracy; Horan, Kristin; Lim, Chung Xiann",,,597
267808,Part 1: COVID-19 and knowledge for midwifery practice—impact and care of pregnant women,2021,"BACKGROUND: Despite many reports on the characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, relatively little is known about the transmission features of COVID-19 outside Wuhan, especially at the provincial level. METHODS: We collected epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological and occupation information, along with contact history, of 671 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 reported from January 23 to February 5, 2020, in Henan province, China. We described characteristics of these cases, compared the diagnostic accuracy and features of blood testing, computed tomography (CT) scans and X-rays, and analysed SARS-CoV-2 transmission sources and patients' occupations in Henan province. RESULTS: The mean age of patients in this case series was 43 years, 56.2% were male and 22.4% had coexisting medical disorders. The death rate was 0.3%. Fourteen patients did not show any symptoms. Lymphocyte percentage was associated with disease severity (&#967;2 = 6.71, P = 0.035) but had a large variation in each sample group. The mean time from illness onset to diagnosis was 5.6 days. A total of 330 patients had ever lived in or visited Wuhan, 150 had contact with confirmed cases, 323 had been to a hospital and 119 had been to a wet market. There were 33 patients who did not have a traceable transmission source, with 21.2% of these being farmers and 15.2% being workmen. CONCLUSIONS: Lymphocyte percentage was a sign of severe COVID-19 in general but was not a good diagnostic index. Longer time from illness onset to diagnosis was associated with higher COVID-19 severity, older age, higher likelihood of having coexisting cardiovascular diseases including hypertension, and being male. Farming was found to be a high-risk occupation in Henan province, China.","Nie, Yifei; Li, Jitian; Huang, Xueyong; Guo, Wanshen; Zhang, Xiaobai; Ma, Yan; Wang, Haifeng; Qi, Muge; Tang, Xiaoyan; Shen, Xiaojing; Dai, Xiaofeng",Int. j. epidemiol,,597

METHODS: All healthcare providers in the South West of England (population 4 million) participated in this evaluation. 3890 patients aged &#8805;50 years presenting in primary care with low-risk symptoms of colorectal cancer had a FIT from 01/06/2018 to 31/12/2018. A threshold of 10 µg Hb/g faeces defined a positive test. RESULTS: Six hundred and eighteen (15.9%) patients tested positive; 458 (74.1%) had an urgent referral to specialist lower gastrointestinal (GI) services within three months. Forty-three were diagnosed with colorectal cancer within 12 months. 3272 tested negative; 324 (9.9%) had an urgent referral within three months. Eight were diagnosed with colorectal cancer within 12 months. Positive predictive value was 7.0% (95% CI 5.1-9.3%). Negative predictive value was 99.8% (CI 99.5-99.9%). Sensitivity was 84.3% (CI 71.4-93.0%), specificity 85.0% (CI 83.8-86.1%). The area under the ROC curve was 0.92 (CI 0.86-0.96). A threshold of 37 µg Hb/g faeces would identify patients with an individual 3% risk of cancer.

268337,Letter to the Editor: Exponential Increase in COVID-19 Related Publications Compared to Other Pandemic Diseases,2020,"BACKGROUND: As millions of workers have shifted to telework, special accommodations for workers with respect to ergonomics may be required to ensure the workforce remains healthy. METHODS: A survey about home office ergonomics and discomfort was sent to faculty, staff, and administrators by email and was completed by 843 individuals. RESULTS: Over 40%of the participants reported moderate to severe discomfort (severe low/middle back pain, moderate discomfort in eyes/neck/head, and discomfort in the upper back/shoulders). Laptops (always and often) were widely used (85%) with most using the laptop monitor (55%) of all respondents. Further, less than 45%of the seating conditions were reported as having adjustable arm rests. CONCLUSION: As teleworking in makeshift offices becomes more common, the risk of significant discomfort and potentially more serious musculoskeletal disorders may result from poor static postures. Companies may need to accommodate workers by allowing them to take home office chairs, external monitors, keyboards, and mice as laptops are insufficient, ergonomically.","Gerding, Thomas; Syck, Megan; Daniel, Denise; Naylor, Jennifer; Kotowski, Susan E; Gillespie, Gordon L; Freeman, Andrew M; Huston, Thomas R; Davis, Kermit G",Work,,597

Despite the high mortality rates from SARS-CoV-1 and Middle-East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV infections, which both sparked the interest of the scientific community, the underlying physiopathology of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, remains partially unclear. SARS-CoV-2 shares similar features with SARS-CoV-1, notably the use of the angiotensin conversion enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor to enter the host cells. However, some features of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic are unique. In this work, we focus on the association between obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes on the one hand, and the severity of COVID-19 infection on the other, as it seems greater in these patients. We discuss how adipocyte dysfunction leads to a specific immune environment that predisposes obese patients to respiratory failure during COVID-19. We also hypothesize that an ACE2-cleaved protein, angiotensin 1-7, has a beneficial action on immune deregulation and that its low expression during the SARS-CoV-2 infection could explain the severity of infection. This introduces angiotensin 1-7 as a potential candidate of interest in therapeutic research on CoV infections.","Méry, Geoffroy; Epaulard, Olivier; Borel, Anne-Laure; Toussaint, Bertrand; Le Gouellec, Audrey",Front Immunol,,597

We aimed to compare the endogenous oxidative damage markers of coenzyme Q10, nicotinamide dinucleotide oxidase 4, malondialdehyde, and ischemia-modified albumin levels in patients with pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 and in an healthy control group. We also aimed to compare these parameters between patients with severe and non-severe pulmonary involvement. METHODS: The study included 58 adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and 30 healthy volunteers. CoQ10 and MDA levels were determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography. NOX4 and IMA levels were determined by ELISA assay and colorimetric method. RESULTS: Higher levels of CoQ10, MDA, NOX4, and IMA and lower levels of COQ10H were observed in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia than in the control group. MDA, IMA, NOX4, and CoQ10 levels were significantly higher in patients with severe pulmonary involvement than in patients with non-severe pulmonary involvement, but no significant difference was observed in CoQ10H levels. CoQ10 levels were significantly and positively correlated with both ferritin and CRP levels. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is significantly associated with increased endogenous oxidative damage.

SARS-CoV-2 infection in human has a broad clinical spectrum ranging from mild to severe cases, with a mortality rate of ~6.4% worldwide (based on World Health Organization daily situation report). However, the dynamics of viral infection, replication and shedding are poorly understood. Here, we show that Rhesus macaques are susceptible to the infection by SARS-CoV-2. After intratracheal inoculation, the first peak of viral RNA was observed in oropharyngeal swabs one day post infection (1 d.p.i.), mainly from the input of the inoculation, while the second peak occurred at 5 d.p.i., which reflected on-site replication in the respiratory tract. Histopathological observation shows that SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause interstitial pneumonia in animals, characterized by hyperemia and edema, and infiltration of monocytes and lymphocytes in alveoli. We also identified SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory tract tissues, including trachea, bronchus and lung; and viruses were also re-isolated from oropharyngeal swabs, bronchus and lung, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrated that neutralizing antibodies generated from the primary infection could protect the Rhesus macaques from a second-round challenge by SARS-CoV-2. The non-human primate model that we established here provides a valuable platform to study SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and to evaluate candidate vaccines and therapeutics.","Shan, Chao; Yao, Yan-Feng; Yang, Xing-Lou; Zhou, Yi-Wu; Gao, Ge; Peng, Yun; Yang, Lian; Hu, Xue; Xiong, Jin; Jiang, Ren-Di; Zhang, Hua-Jun; Gao, Xiao-Xiao; Peng, Cheng; Min, Juan; Chen, Ying; Si, Hao-Rui; Wu, Jia; Zhou, Peng; Wang, Yan-Yi; Wei, Hong-Ping; Pang, Wei; Hu, Zheng-Fei; Lv, Long-Bao; Zheng, Yong-Tang; Shi, Zheng-Li; Yuan, Zhi-Ming",Cell Res,,597

As a result, we estimate the rise in the unemployment rate over the corresponding period to be surprisingly small, only about 2 percentage points. Third, participation in the labor force has declined by 7 percentage points, an unparalleled fall that dwarfs the three percentage point cumulative decline that occurred from 2008 to 2016.","Coibion, O.; Weber, M.; Gorodnichenko, Y.",Working Paper Series - National Bureau of Economic Research (Massachusetts)|2020.

The symptoms appear to be more severe in males older than 65 and people with underlying health conditions; approximately one in five individuals could be at risk worldwide. The virus's sequence was rapidly established days after the first cases were reported and identified an RNA virus from the Coronaviridae family closely related to a Betacoronavirus virus found in bats in China. SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh coronavirus known to infect humans, and with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), the only ones to cause severe diseases. Lessons from these two previous outbreaks guided the identification of critical therapeutic targets such as the spike viral proteins promoting the virus's cellular entry through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor expressed on the surface of multiple types of eukaryotic cells. Although several therapeutic agents are currently evaluated, none seems to provide a clear path for a cure. Also, various types of vaccines are developed in record time to address the urgency of efficient SARS-CoV-2 prevention. Currently, 58 vaccines are evaluated in clinical trials, including 11 in phase III, and 3 of them reported efficacy above 90 %. The results so far from the clinical trials suggest the availability of multiple effective vaccines within months.","Bakhiet, Moiz; Taurin, Sebastien",Cytokine growth factor rev,,597

COVID-19 disease progression include lymphopenia, elevated proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, accumulation of macrophages and neutrophils in lungs, immune dysregulation, cytokine storms, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), etc. Development of vaccines to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and other coronavirus has been difficult to create due to vaccine induced enhanced disease responses in animal models. Multiple betacoronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 expand cellular tropism by infecting some phagocytic cells (immature macrophages and dendritic cells) via antibody bound Fc receptor uptake of virus. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) may be involved in the clinical observation of increased severity of symptoms associated with early high levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in patients. Infants with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19 may also have ADE caused by maternally acquired SARS-CoV-2 antibodies bound to mast cells. ADE risks associated with SARS-CoV-2 has implications for COVID-19 and MIS-C treatments, B-cell vaccines, SARS-CoV-2 antibody therapy, and convalescent plasma therapy for patients. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies bound to mast cells may be involved in MIS-C and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults (MIS-A) following initial COVID-19 infection. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies bound to Fc receptors on macrophages and mast cells may represent two different mechanisms for ADE in patients. These two different ADE risks have possible implications for SARS-CoV-2 B-cell vaccines for subsets of populations based on age, cross-reactive antibodies, variabilities in antibody levels over time, and pregnancy. These models place increased emphasis on the importance of developing safe SARS-CoV-2 T cell vaccines that are not dependent upon antibodies.","Ricke, Darrell O",Front Immunol,,597
273654,Public engagement is key for containing COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"We have read with great interest the two editorials by Burdorf et al: ""The COVID-19 pandemic: one year later - an occupational perspective"" (1) and ""The COVID-19 (Coronavirus) pandemic: consequences for occupational health"" (2). The authors highlight the importance of the societal consequences of the outbreak and changes in the world of work to manage occupational health. The key points identified - such as individual socio-economic factors, psychological effects and occupations with highest risk of contamination - modify return-to-work approaches. It is estimated that around 800 million people of working age worldwide were living with disabilities before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In early January 2021, the cumulative COVID-19 hospitalisation rate reached 207.4/100 000 (18-49-year-olds) and 505.7/100 000 (50-64-year-olds), respectively, in the United States (3). In France, the hospitalisation rate was 411.5/100 000 across all ages (4). A recent cohort study of working-age men who were hospitalised for COVID-19 highlighted the long-term health consequences of such a disease (5). The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic creates new challenges for occupational health, shifting attention away from return-to-work after health problems to resuming work during an outbreak, dealing with lockdown, and taking special account of workers with vulnerabilities (6, 7). We recommend considering three different aspects of occupational medicine during a pandemic. Firstly, for most workers at high-risk of severe COVID-19, the issues of work disability and resuming work had never occurred before the epidemic. Recommendations such as physical and social distancing and wearing a facemask are highly advisable to protect against infection but may not be enough to enable some individuals to resume work. Therefore, decision-making requires individual comprehensive assessments of the underlying medical condition, the SARS-CoV-2 contamination risk associated with either regular work or teleworking, and vaccination opportunities. The second situation concerns workers who have suffered from COVID-19. Preliminary studies suggest that long recovery duration is related to high severity (7), but this is still a matter of debate for patients suffering from ""long COVID-19"" (5, 8, 9), a condition for which the long-term effects remain unknown. Any long-running recovery must be considered to be a potential sign of long COVID-19. These long-lasting syndromes occur among patients with severe symptoms but have also been reported independently of acute phase severity, hospitalisation and receiving medical oxygen (8, 9). Researchers worldwide are currently investigating such syndromes. Strategies promoting return to work for these workers will need to be implemented and could be similar to programmes developed for other chronic conditions. Moreover, numerous more serious sequelae following critical illness suggest the need for enhanced support by rehabilitation and occupational health specialists. Finally, the consequences of the epidemic must be evaluated over time for people who suffered from functional limitations before COVID-19 as their physical and mental condition may be modified by the epidemic and, specifically, the consequences of lockdown (10). In all of these situations, medical, social, financial and working contexts are key elements. In addition to a medical assessment, the use of scales such as the Work Ability Index (WAI) (11) or the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) (12) can help perform long-term follow-up and provide information about work capacity and workload. It also gives a ""back to basics"" perspective, urging politicians to move towards a `decent-work-for-all` policy, as advocated by the United Nation`s Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8, which the WHO has endorsed (13).

The pandemic caused by COVID-19 has forced universities to switch from face-to-face to online instruction. Furthermore, this transfer process was planned and executed quickly, with urgent redesigns of courses originally conceived for live teaching. The aim of this work is to measure the service quality of online teaching delivered during the COVID-19 period. The methodology was based on an importance-performance analysis using a structural equations model. The data were obtained from a sample of 467 students attending a university in southern Spain. The results reveal five priority attributes of online teaching that need to be improved in order to enhance the service quality of the virtual instruction provided to students. Universities need to redefine their online format by integrating methodological and technological decisions and involving collaboration between teachers, students and administration staff and services. The results do not apply to educational institutions that exclusively teach courses online, but to those institutions that had to rapidly adapt, and shift course material originally designed for face-to-face training.","Ramírez-Hurtado, José M; Hernández-Díaz, Alfredo G; López-Sánchez, Ana D; Pérez-León, Víctor E",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,597

However, delaying cancer-specific therapies could have a deleterious effect on survival. The potential suppressive effects of chemotherapies or cancer-related microenvironment raised the question on how cancer patients' immune system responds to SARS-CoV-2 virus. METHODS: We have started a prospective monocentric trial entitled COV-CREM (NCT04365322) in April 2020. The primary objective of the trial was to assess specific immune response's intensity and diversity to SARS-CoV-2 in infected patients. RESULTS: In this study, we showed that cancer patients (28 solid tumours, 11 haematological malignancies) exposed to SARS-CoV-2 produced a high rate of specific antibodies, as observed in patients without a cancer history (n = 29). However, our results highlight a lack in the generation of T-cell responses against CoV-N, M and S proteins from the SARS-CoV-2 virus, suggesting that cancer patients failed to mount a protective T-cell immunity. Nevertheless, SARS-CoV-2 infection did not impair established immune memory since specific responses against common viruses were not hampered in cancer patients. CONCLUSION: Given the severity and the unknown evolution of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it is of fundamental importance to integrate cancer patients in vaccination programs.","Mansi, Laura; Spehner, Laurie; Daguindau, Etienne; Bouiller, Kevin; Almotlak, Hamadi; Stein, Ulrich; Bouard, Adeline; Kim, Stefano; Klajer, Elodie; Jary, Marine; Meynard, Guillaume; Vienot, Angélique; Nardin, Charlée; Bazan, Fernando; Lepiller, Quentin; Westeel, Virginie; Adotévi, Olivier; Borg, Christophe; Kroemer, Marie",Eur J Cancer,,597

A comprehensive systematized review",2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To discuss key considerations involved in adapting an in-person ophthalmology conference to a virtual medium. RECENT FINDINGS: In 2020, several ophthalmological societies have held or are planning to hold virtual conferences in lieu of their previously scheduled in-person ophthalmology conference because of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. The strategic meeting components attempted to be retained in these transitions include educational information disseminating, academic discussion with colleagues, sponsorships, and networking. Live-streamed components of a virtual conference may be entirely real time or may include a combination of both prerecorded and live-streamed components. A virtual meeting may offer either a single live-streamed program or several concurrent live-streamed programs from which attendees can choose. The availability of on-demand content, mechanisms for audience participation, avenues for industry interaction and contribution, registration costs, and continuing medical education credit availability vary between virtual meeting formats. SUMMARY: Transition of an in-person ophthalmology conference to a virtual format with retention of the inherent value associated with the meeting is possible and the experiences of societies executing this adaptation can be helpful for others entering this space. There are numerous considerations regarding meeting format and logistics to contemplate in light of each meeting's specific audience and objectives.","Gupta, Mrinali P; Sridhar, Jayanth; Wykoff, Charles C; Yonekawa, Yoshihiro",Curr Opin Ophthalmol,,597

METHODS: This study included 20 adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU of DHQ Hospital, Faisalabad (Pakistan). Patients were categorised into the survival group and the death group according to the outcome. We retrieved demographics, clinical manifestations and signs, laboratory indicators, treatment measures and clinical outcomes from the medical record, and summarised the clinical characteristics and outcomes of these patients. RESULTS: The average age of patients was 70 ± 12 years, of which 40% were male. They were admitted to the ICU 11 days after the onset of symptoms. The most common symptoms on admission were cough (19 cases, 95%), fatigue or myalgia (18 cases, 90%), fever (17 cases, 85%) and dyspnoea (16 cases, 80%). Eleven (55%) patients had underlying diseases, of which hypertension was the most common (11 cases, 55%), followed by cardiovascular disease (4 cases, 20%) and diabetes (3 cases, 15%). Six patients (30%) received invasive mechanical ventilation and continuous renal replacement therapy and eventually died. Acute heart injury was the most common complication (19 cases, 95%). Ten (50%) patients died between 2 and 19 days after admission to the ICU. Compared with dead patients, the average body weight of surviving patients was lower (61.70 ± 2.36 vs 68.60 ± 7.15, P = .01), Glasgow Coma Scale score was higher (14.69 ± 0.70 vs 12.70 ± 2.45, P = .03), with fewer concurrent shocks (2 vs 10, P = .001) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (2 vs 10, P = .001). CONCLUSION: The mortality rate is high in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Lower Glasgow Coma Scale, higher body weight and decreased lymphocyte count appear to be potential risk factors for the death of patients with COVID-19 in the ICU.","Gul, Noor; Usman, Umer; Ahmed, Umair; Ali, Majid; Shaukat, Aamir; Imran, Mehar Muhammad",Int J Clin Pract,,597

277649,The Impact of COVID-19 Disease on Platelets and Coagulation,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic closed university campuses across the country. Nurse educators were challenged to develop innovative solutions for students to complete course requirements. The on-campus poster session used by a college of nursing as a scholarly forum for dissemination of all Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) student final projects was cancelled due to the pandemic. METHOD: Nurse educators developed and implemented an interactive, synchronous virtual session using the Zoom Video Communications platform. RESULTS: Twelve virtual sessions were held, and 73 students presented DNP project posters. More than 150 students and faculty attended the virtual poster sessions. Students and faculty had positive feedback regarding the virtual format. Student presentations were academically rigorous, and audiences engaged in robust discussion with DNP students. CONCLUSION: The virtual platform was successfully used for an interactive presentation by DNP student and nursing faculty participants. This format may be especially valuable for use of scholarship dissemination by distance learning programs.

SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped RNA virus that relies on its trimeric surface glycoprotein, spike, for entry into host cells. Here we describe the COVID-19 vaccine candidate MV-014-212, a live attenuated, recombinant human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) expressing a chimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike as the only viral envelope protein. MV-014-212 was attenuated and immunogenic in African green monkeys (AGMs). One mucosal administration of MV-014-212 in AGMs protected against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, reducing by more than 200- fold the peak shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in the nose. MV-014-212 elicited mucosal immunity in the nose and neutralizing antibodies in serum that exhibited cross-neutralization against two virus variants of concern. Intranasally delivered, live attenuated vaccines such as MV-014-212 entail low-cost manufacturing suitable for global deployment.

279756,Exploring Changes in Caregiver Burden and Caregiving Intensity due to COVID-19,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Surrogate medical decision making is common in the United States healthcare system. Variables that may influence surrogate decision making have been proposed. Little work has examined relations between these variables and outcomes of surrogate decision making. This study investigated whether surrogates' characteristics, including their knowledge of treatment options, and interpersonal factors predicted surrogates' accuracy and intervention selections. Specifically, predictor variables included: trust in the medical profession, trait-level anxiety, depression, anxiety about COVID-19, religiosity, perceived emotional support, understanding of treatment options, empathy, willingness to accept responsibility for medical decisions, reluctance to burden others, and perceived similarity between oneself and the patient. METHODS: 154 pairs of patients and their surrogates completed an online survey. Patients indicated preferred treatments in hypothetical decision scenarios. Surrogates indicated the treatment that they thought the patient would prefer. RESULTS: When taken all together in a predictive model, the variables significantly predicted surrogates' accuracy, F (6) = 3.03, R2 = .12, p = .008. Variables also predicted selection of intensive interventions, F (4) = 5.95, R2 = .14, p = .00. Surrogates reporting greater anxiety about COVID-19 selected more intensive interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with prior research, this study found that surrogates' characteristics influence the interventions they choose, with anxiety about COVID-19 having considerable bearing on their chosen interventions. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: These findings can inform development of decision-making interventions to improve surrogates' accuracy. Providers may attend to variables highlighted by this study to support surrogates, particularly within the stressful context of COVID-19 and possible future pandemics.","Spalding, Rachael L; Edelstein, Barry",Patient educ. couns,,597
280033,"COVID-19: The Experience from Beijing, China",2020,"In the past two decades, supercritical fluid chromatography has evolved from a niche application to a comprehensive technology and a fully-fledged alternative to conventional high-performance liquid chromatography. In this study, we have focused on chiral separation of synthetic cathinones in gradient supercritical fluid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry using an inverse gradient of a make-up solvent. Synthetic cathinones possess an amphetamine-like effect and, therefore, are frequently being offered on the Internet as a replacement for illicit drugs. Cathinones are chiral compounds, however, they are usually marketed and used as racemic mixtures. Since the effect of individual enantiomers can significantly vary, there is a need for the development of enantioseparation methods enabling to study the biological effects of individual enantiomers. Since cathinones are basic molecules, they are easily protonated (positively charged) under weakly acidic mobile phase conditions, which is a typical feature of supercritical mobile phases with an alcohol as an organic modifier. The positively charged species represent ideal analytes for ion exchangers, such as chiral zwitterion ion exchangers Chiralpak ZWIX (+) and Chiralpak ZWIX (-), which possess a positively and negatively charged unit in the molecular structure of the selectors. The presence of the positive charge in the selector's structure, functioning as a counter-ion for the positively charged analytes, significantly reduces the required amount of a buffer, which is plausible for hyphenation of such a separation system with mass spectrometry. For mass spectrometry hyphenated to supercritical fluid chromatography, the use of a make-up solvent is required to avoid analyte precipitation when using a low concentration of an organic co-solvent (modifier) in the super-/subcritical mobile phase. Hereby, we introduce a unique approach, which is based on the gradient introduction of the make-up to the post-column effluent. Using this approach, it is possible to keep constant the overall amount of the organic solvent (modifier and make-up) introduced into the mass spectrometer when using a gradient of the organic modifier. We show that the developed gradient elution method facilitates the chiral separation of all employed analytes, while the mobile-phase gradient compensation by the inverse make-up gradient enables their detection with high signal intensities.","Kolderová, Natalie; Jurásek, Bronislav; Kuchar, Martin; Lindner, Wolfgang; Kohout, Michal",J Chromatogr A,,597

However, how a single gene integrates both ROS and SA pathways remains poorly understood. Here, we show that Arabidopsis WRKY55 transcription factor positively regulates ROS and SA accumulation and thus leaf senescence and resistance against the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae WRKY55 is predominantly expressed in senescent leaves and encodes a transcriptional activator localized to nuclei. Both inducible and constitutive overexpression of WRKY55 accelerates leaf senescence, while mutants delay it. A transcriptomic sequencing identified 1,448 differentially expressed gens (DEGs), of which 1,157 genes are up-regulated by WRKY55 expression. Accordingly, the ROS and SA contents in WRKY55-overexpression plants are higher than that in the control, while mutants showed a contrast change. Moreover, WRKY55 positively regulates defense against Pseudomonas syringae Finally we show that WRKY55 activates the expression of RbohD, ICS1, PBS3 and SAG13 through directly binding to the W-box-containing fragments. Taken together, our work has identified a novel WRKY transcription factor that integrates both ROS and SA pathways to regulate leaf senescence and pathogen resistance.","Wang, Yiqiao; Cui, Xing; Yang, Bo; Xu, Shutao; Wei, Xiangyan; Zhao, Peiyu; Niu, Fangfang; Sun, Mengting; Wang, Chen; Cheng, Hao; Jiang, Yuan-Qing",Development (Camb.),,597

280147,What's Important: Empathy for Leaders in the Time of COVID-19,2021,"Prediction of Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) has been an important aspect of Pharmacovigilance because of its impact in the pharma industry. The standard process of introduction of a new drug into a market involves a lot of clinical trials and tests. This is a tedious and time consuming process and also involves a lot of monetary resources. The faster approval of a drug helps the patients who are in need of the drug. The in silico prediction of Adverse Drug Reactions can help speed up the aforementioned process. The challenges involved are lack of negative data present and predicting ADR from just the chemical structure. Although many models are already available to predict ADR, most of the models use biological activities identifiers, chemical and physical properties in addition to chemical structures of the drugs. But for most of the new drugs to be tested, only chemical structures will be available. The performance of the existing models predicting ADR only using chemical structures is not efficient. Therefore, an efficient prediction of ADRs from just the chemical structure has been proposed in this paper. The proposed method involves a separate model for each ADR, making it a binary classification problem. This paper presents a novel CNN model called Drug Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) to predict ADRs using chemical structures of the drugs. The performance is measured using the metrics such as Accuracy, Recall, Precision, Specificity, F1 score, AUROC and MCC. The results obtained by the proposed DCNN model outperform the competing models on the SIDER4.1 database in terms of all the metrics. A case study has been performed on a COVID-19 recommended drugs, where the proposed model predicted the ADRs that are well aligned with the observations made by medical professionals using conventional methods.","Mantripragada, Anjani Sankar; Teja, Sai Phani; Katasani, Rohith Reddy; Joshi, Pratik; V, Masilamani; Ramesh, Raj",J Bioinform Comput Biol,,597

The early identification of severe COVID-19 is of critical concern. In addition, the correlation between the immunological features and clinical outcomes in severe cases needs to be explored. OBJECTIVE: To build a nomogram for identifying patients with severe COVID-19 and explore the immunological features correlating with fatal outcomes. METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 85 and 41 patients with COVID-19 in primary and validation cohorts, respectively. A predictive nomogram based on risk factors for severe COVID-19 was constructed using the primary cohort and evaluated internally and externally. In addition, in the validation cohort, immunological features in patients with severe COVID-19 were analyzed and correlated with disease outcomes. RESULTS: The risk prediction nomogram incorporating age, C-reactive protein, and D-dimer for early identification of patients with severe COVID-19 showed favorable discrimination in both the primary (area under the curve [AUC] 0.807) and validation cohorts (AUC 0.902) and was well calibrated. Patients who died from COVID-19 showed lower abundance of peripheral CD45RO+CD3+ T cells and natural killer cells, but higher neutrophil counts than that in the patients who recovered (P = .001, P = .009, and P = .009, respectively). Moreover, the abundance of CD45RO+CD3+ T cells, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and neutrophil-to-natural killer cell ratio were strong indicators of death in patients with severe COVID-19 (AUC 0.933 for all 3). CONCLUSION: The novel nomogram aided the early identification of severe COVID-19 cases. In addition, the abundance of CD45RO+CD3+ T cells and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte and neutrophil-to-natural killer cell ratios may serve as useful prognostic predictors in severe patients.","Cai, Li; Zhou, Xi; Wang, Miao; Mei, Heng; Ai, Lisha; Mu, Shidai; Zhao, Xiaoyan; Chen, Wei; Hu, Yu; Wang, Huafang",J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract,,597

Experimental studies justify that among respiratory virus infected mice, a weaker ER signaling leads to increased morbidity and mortality in both males and females. In animal experiments, estrogen treatment silences the inflammatory reactions and decreases virus titers leading to improved survival rate; it seems to be an ideal prevention and therapy against COVID-19. We should overcome the widespread reluctance to estrogen therapy as we have a unique estrogen formula; conjugated estrogens, or conjugated equine estrogens available under the brand name of Premarin deriving from natural sources. Premarin can exert similar ER upregulative and gene repairing power like endogenous estrogen without any risk for adverse reactions.

A prospective series of 100 consecutive patients admitted to the Spedali Civili University Hospital in Brescia (Italy) between March 9th and March 20th with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and ARDS requiring ventilatory support was analyzed to determine whether intravenous administration of tocilizumab (TCZ), a monoclonal antibody that targets the interleukin 6 (IL-6) receptor, was associated with improved outcome. Tocilizumab was administered at a dosage of 8 mg/kg by two consecutive intravenous infusions 12 h apart. A third infusion was optional based on clinical response. The outcome measure was an improvement in acute respiratory failure assessed by means of the Brescia COVID Respiratory Severity Score (BCRSS 0 to 8, with higher scores indicating higher severity) at 24-72 h and 10 days after tocilizumab administration. Out of 100 treated patients (88 M, 12 F; median age: 62 years), 43 received TCZ in the intensive care unit (ICU), while 57 in the general ward as no ICU beds were available. Of these 57 patients, 37 (65%) improved and suspended noninvasive ventilation (NIV) (median BCRSS: 1 [IQR 0-2]), 7 (12%) patients remained stable in NIV, and 13 (23%) patients worsened (10 died, 3 were admitted to ICU). Of the 43 patients treated in the ICU, 32 (74%) improved (17 of them were taken off the ventilator and were discharged to the ward), 1 (2%) remained stable (BCRSS: 5) and 10 (24%) died (all of them had BCRSS&#8805;7 before TCZ). Overall at 10 days, the respiratory condition was improved or stabilized in 77 (77%) patients, of whom 61 showed a significant clearing of diffuse bilateral opacities on chest x-ray and 15 were discharged from the hospital. Respiratory condition worsened in 23 (23%) patients, of whom 20 (20%) died.

Nutrition is a key factor related to this disease, and nutritional status may determine the risk and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Selenium is one of the major trace elements required for redox functions and has significant roles in viral infections. The purpose of this review was to examine the current evidence on the role of selenium in COVID-19. We reviewed studies on selenium and COVID-19, and other relevant studies to understand how selenium status can modify the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and how selenium status might affect a person post-infection. RECENT FINDINGS: We found that oxidative stress is a characteristic feature of COVID-19 disease, which is linked with the immunopathological disorder observed in individuals with severe COVID-19. Selenium plays a key role in strengthening immunity, reducing oxidative stress, preventing viral infections and supporting critical illness. Moreover, selenium deficiency is related to oxidative stress and hyperinflammation seen in critical illness, and selenium deficiency is found to be associated with the severity of COVID-19 disease. Selenium supplementation at an appropriate dose may act as supportive therapy in COVID-19. Future studies in large cohorts of COVID-19 are warranted to verify the benefits of selenium supplementation for reducing risk and severity of COVID-19.","Khatiwada, Saroj; Subedi, Astha",Curr Nutr Rep,,597

283099,Catching our breath: reshaping rehabilitation services for COVID-19,2020,"Influenza viruses cause annual epidemics and occasional pandemics of respiratory tract infections that produce a wide spectrum of clinical disease severity in humans. The novel betacoronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in December 2019 and has since caused a pandemic. Both viral and host factors determine the extent and severity of virus-induced lung damage. The host's response to viral infection is necessary for viral clearance but may be deleterious and contribute to severe disease phenotypes. Similarly, tissue repair mechanisms are required for recovery from infection across the spectrum of disease severity; however, dysregulated repair responses may lead to chronic lung dysfunction. Understanding of the mechanisms of immunopathology and tissue repair following viral lower respiratory tract infection may broaden treatment options. In this Review, we discuss the pathogenesis, the contribution of the host response to severe clinical phenotypes and highlight early and late epithelial repair mechanisms following influenza virus infection, each of which has been well characterized. Although we are still learning about SARS-CoV-2 and its disease manifestations in humans, throughout the Review we discuss what is known about SARS-CoV-2 in the context of this broad knowledge of influenza virus, highlighting the similarities and differences between the respiratory viruses.","Flerlage, Tim; Boyd, David F; Meliopoulos, Victoria; Thomas, Paul G; Schultz-Cherry, Stacey",Nat. rev. microbiol,,597
283606,How Extrapulmonary Symptoms Involving the Gastrointestinal Tract and Elevations in Transaminase Levels Can Be Indicative of an Early Phase of Covid-19: a Case Study,2021,"The demand for same-day delivery (SDD) has increased rapidly in the last few years and has particularly boomed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Existing literature on the problem has focused on maximizing the utility, represented as the total number of expected requests served. However, a utility-driven solution results in unequal opportunities for customers to receive delivery service, raising questions about fairness. In this paper, we study the problem of achieving fairness in SDD. We construct a regional-level fairness constraint that ensures customers from different regions have an equal chance of being served. We develop a reinforcement learning model to learn policies that focus on both overall utility and fairness. Experimental results demonstrate the ability of our approach to mitigate the unfairness caused by geographic differences and constraints of resources, at both coarser and finer-grained level and with a small cost to utility. In addition, we simulate a real-world situation where the system is suddenly overwhelmed by a surge of requests, mimicking the COVID-19 scenario. Our model is robust to the systematic pressure and is able to maintain fairness with little compromise to the utility.","Chen, Xinwei; Wang, Tong; Thomas, Barrett W.; Ulmer, Marlin W.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.09541v1.pdf,597

This case study applied an ethnographic content analysis to examine how the cancellation or postponement of sport as a result of COVID-19 was framed across 22 episodes of SportsCenter from March 8 to 14, 2020. More than 134 min of coveragewas devoted toCOVID-19-related stories, and 268 unique types of stories were produced. Descriptive statistics suggested that COVID-19 was framed as having a direct impact on U.S. men's professional sports leagues and the National Collegiate Athletic Association men's basketball tournament. When considering news format characteristics, SportsCenter produced its coverage through convenience and relevance to ESPN, not sport. Even during a ""breaking news"" pandemic, SportsCenter retained its long-standing news process of gender bias and nationalistic favoritism. The visual difficulty of how to ""show"" coronavirus also presented a production challenge, but the messages and cues embedded in the visuals depicted a rapid shift in discourse that focused on basic reporting without health or global context.

285967,A review of Cameroonian medicinal plants with potentials for the management of the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Objective: The vaccination of skilled nursing facility (SNF) staff is a critical component in the battle against COVID-19. Together, residents and staff constitute the single most vulnerable population in the pandemic. The health of these workers is completely entangled with the health of those they care for. Vaccination of SNF staff is key to increasing uptake of the vaccine, reducing health disparities, and reopening SNFs to visitors. Yet, as the vaccine rollout begins, some SNF staff are declining to be vacci-nated. The purpose of this article is to describe reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy reported by staff of skilled nursing facilities and understand factors that could potentially reduce hesitancy. Design: Five virtual focus groups were conducted with staff of SNFs as part of a larger project to improve vaccine uptake. Setting and Participants: Focus groups with 58 staff members were conducted virtually using Zoom. Measures: Focus groups sought to elicit concerns, perspectives, and experiences related to COVID-19 testing and vaccination. Results: Our findings indicate that some SNF staff are hesitant to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Reasons for this hesitancy include beliefs that the vaccine has been developed too fast and without sufficient testing;personal fears about pre-existing medical conditions, and more general distrust of the government. Conclusions and Implications: SNF staff indicate that seeing people like themselves receive the vaccination is more important than seeing public figures. We discuss the vaccination effort as a social enterprise and the need to develop long-term care provider-academic-community partnerships in response to COVID-19 and in expectation of future pandemics.

286283,A Critical Reflection on Environmental Education During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Large-scale deployment of COVID-19 vaccines will seriously affect the ongoing phases 2 and 3 randomised placebo-controlled trials assessing SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates. The effect will be particularly acute in high-income countries where the entire adult or older population could be vaccinated by late 2021. Regrettably, only a small proportion of the population in many low-income and middle-income countries will have access to available vaccines. Sponsors of COVID-19 vaccine candidates currently in phase 2 or initiating phase 3 trials in 2021 should consider continuing the research in countries with limited affordability and availability of COVID-19 vaccines. Several ethical principles must be implemented to ensure the equitable, non-exploitative, and respectful conduct of trials in resource-poor settings. Once sufficient knowledge on the immunogenicity response to COVID-19 vaccines is acquired, non-inferiority immunogenicity trials-comparing the immune response of a vaccine candidate to that of an authorised vaccine-would probably be the most common trial design. Until then, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover trials will continue to play a role in the development of new vaccine candidates. WHO or the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences should define an ethical framework for the requirements and benefits for trial participants and host communities in resource-poor settings that should require commitment from all vaccine candidate sponsors from high-income countries.","Dal-Ré, Rafael; Bekker, Linda-Gail; Gluud, Christian; Holm, Søren; Jha, Vivekanand; Poland, Gregory A; Rosendaal, Frits R; Schwarzer-Daum, Brigitte; Sevene, Esperança; Tinto, Halidou; Voo, Teck Chuan; Sreeharan, Nadarajah","Lancet, Infect. dis.

286466,Is there a role for cough suppression techniques in the COVID-19 era?,2020,"Following the decline in Physical Activity (PA) due to COVID-19 restrictions in the form of government mandated lockdowns and closures of public spaces, the modulatory effect of physical exercise on immunity is being heavily revisited. In an attempt to comprehend the wide discrepancy in patient response to COVID-19 and the factors that potentially modulate it, we summarize the findings relating PA to inflammation and immunity. A distinction is drawn between moderate intensity and high intensity physical exercise based on the high lactate production observed in the latter. We hypothesize that, the lactate production associated with high intensity anaerobic exercise is implicated in the modulation of several components of the innate and adaptive immunity. In this review, we also summarize these immunomodulatory effects of lactate. These include increasing serum IL-6 levels, the main mediator of cytokine storms, as well as affecting NK cells, Macrophages, Dendritic cells and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. The implications of high lactate levels in athletic performance are highlighted where athletes should undergo endurance training to increase VO2 max and minimize lactate production. Tumor models of hypoxia were also reported where lactate levels are elevated leading to increased invasiveness and angiogenesis. Accordingly, the novel lactate blocking strategy employed in cancer treatment is evaluated for its potential benefit in COVID-19 in addition to the readily available beta-blockers as an antagonist to lactate. Finally, we suggest the diagnostic/prognostic purpose of the elevated lactate levels that can be determined through sweat lactate testing. It is the detrimental effect of lactate on immunity and its presence in sweat that qualify it to be used as a potential non-invasive marker of poor COVID-19 outcome.","AbdelMassih, Antoine Fakhry; Menshawey, Rahma; Hozaien, Rafeef; Kamel, Aya; Mishriky, Fady; Husseiny, Reem J; Hanoura, Aia Mohamed; Yacoub, Elaria; AlShehry, Nada; Menshawey, Esraa; El-Husseiny, Nadine; Yasser, Reem; Arsanyous, Mariem; Nathan, Lauren; Seyam, Mahmoud; Massoud, Doaa; Ali, Nada; Kassim, Assem; AmanAllah, Mostafa; Elsayed, Rokaya; Sheashaa, Hesham; Husseiny, Yousef; Hassan, Nourhan Hatem; Badr, Kirollos; Elkhateb, Amr; Fouad, Verina; Elfishawy, Mayada; Medhat, Omar; Mustafa, Mai; Khalil, Noha; Elsayed, Rawan; Nada, Youssef; Elshawarbi, Passant; Abdelmoneim, Noha; Gamal, Nada; Messiha, Mariam; Ghazy, Marihan; Abdelfatah, Emmy; Nasry, Febronia; Gayed, Ramy; Eesa, Marian; Luis, Merna; Eskandar, Estfana; Yacoub, Shenoda; Saud, Alaa; Rajab, Maram; Abdelaziz, Mariam; Elgamal, Nadine; Jaber, Hutaf; Tayssir, Sara",Med Hypotheses,,597
286474,A COVID-19–Positive Neonate Born to a COVID-19–Negative Mother: Should Asymptomatic Newborns Be Tested?,2021,"BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE WORK: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the current pandemics of coronavirus disease. This virus is able to attack the cells of the airway epithelium by binding to the transmembrane angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). We developed an oral spray that could inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 endocytosis. The spray contains hydroxytyrosol for its anti-viral, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties, and &#945;-cyclodextrin for its ability to deplete sphingolipids, that form the lipid rafts where ACE2 localizes. The aim of the present pilot multi-centric open non-controlled observational study was to evaluate the safety profile of the ""Endovir Stop"" spray. METHODS: An MTT test was performed to evaluate cytotoxicity of the spray in two human cell lines. An oxygen radical absorbance capacity assay was performed to evaluate the antioxidant capacity of the spray. The spray was also tested on 87 healthy subjects on a voluntary basis. RESULTS: The MTT test revealed that the spray is not cytotoxic. The ORAC assay showed a good antioxidant capacity for the spray. Endovir Stop tested on healthy volunteers showed the total absence of side effects and drug interactions during the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that Endovir Stop spray is safe. The next step would be the administration of the efficacy of the spray by testing it to a wider range of people and see whether there is a reduced infection rate of SARS-CoV-2 in the treated subjects than in the non-treated individuals.","Paolacci, Stefano; Ceccarini, Maria Rachele; Codini, Michela; Manara, Elena; Tezzele, Silvia; Percio, Marcella; Capodicasa, Natale; Kroni, Dorela; Dundar, Munis; Ergoren, Mahmut Cerkez; Sanlidag, Tamer; Beccari, Tommaso; Farronato, Marco; Farronato, Giampietro; Tartaglia, Gianluca Martino; Bertelli, Matteo",Acta Biomed,,597

Furthermore, these factors, along with a person's perceived COVID-19 severity and vulnerability influence cyberchondria. Females were significantly more likely to suffer from cyberchondria, however, males were more likely to share news without fact checking their source. Our findings suggest that to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 misinformation and cyberchondria, measures should be taken to enhance a healthy skepticism of health news while simultaneously guarding against information overload.","Laato, Samuli; Islam, A.K.M.

Such metabolic changes provide potential targets for therapeutic approaches that could reduce the impact of infection. Several examples are discussed in this review, which include effects on energy metabolism, glutaminolysis and fatty acid metabolism. The response of the immune system also involves metabolic changes and manipulating these may change the outcome of infection. This could include changing the status of herpesviruses infections from productive to latency. The consequences of viral infections which include coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), may also differ in patients with metabolic problems, such as diabetes mellitus (DM), obesity, and endocrine diseases. Nutrition status may also affect the pattern of events following viral infection and examples that impact on the pattern of human and experimental animal viral diseases and the mechanisms involved are discussed. Finally, we discuss the so far few published reports that have manipulated metabolic events in-vivo to change the outcome of virus infection. The topic is expected to expand in relevance as an approach used alone or in combination with other therapies to shape the nature of virus induced diseases.","Sumbria, Deepak; Berber, Engin; Mathayan, Manikannan; Rouse, Barry T",Front Immunol,,597

The purpose of this study is to investigate the risk factors and predictive value of deterioration on repeatedly performed CT scan during hospitalization.All COVID-19 patients treated in our isolation ward, from January 22, 2020 to February 7, 2020, were reviewed. Patients included were categorized into RD (Radiological Deterioration) group or NRD (No Radiological Deterioration) group according to the manifestation on the CT routinely performed during the hospitalization. All clinical data and CT images were analyzed.Forty three patients were included in our study. All are moderate cases with at least 4 CT scans each. Eighteen (42.9%) patients had radiological deteriorations which were all identified in CT2 (the first CT after admission). Patients in RD group had lower leukocyte count (Pâ=â.003), lymphocyte count (Pâ=â.030), and higher prevalence (Pâ=â.012) of elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) at admission. NRD patients had a lower prevalence of reticulations (Pâ=â.034) on baseline CT (CT1, performed within 2âdays before admission) and a longer duration between symptom onset and the time of CT2 (Pâ<â.01). There was no significant difference in hospital stay or fibrotic change on CT4 (follow-up CT scan performed 4âweeks after discharge) between 2 groups. Shorter duration between symptom onset and CT2 time (odds ratio [OR], 0.436; 95% confidence interval: 0.233-0.816; Pâ<â.01) and lower leukocyte count in baseline evaluation (OR, 0.316; 95% CI: 0.116-0.859; Pâ<â.05) were associated with increased odds of radiological deterioration on CT image during hospitalization.For moderate COVID-19 patients, the value of routinely performed CT during the treatment is limited. We recommend avoiding using CT as a routine monitor in moderate COVID-19 patients.","Gao, Yang; Hu, Yuxiong; Zhu, Junteng; Liu, Huan; Qiu, Rongxian; Lin, Qunying; He, Xiongzhi; Lin, Hai-Bin; Cheng, Shiming; Li, Guangxi",Medicine (Baltimore),,597

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children with psoriasis. METHODS: A survey of children (<18 years) with psoriasis, conducted from June 10 to June 29, 2020. RESULTS: In total, 92 children were included: 71.7% had psoriasis lesions at the time of home lockdown while 45.2% were receiving systemic treatments, and two contracted COVID-19. During lockdown, psoriasis worsened in 47.3% of the children and 18.8% stopped their systemic treatments, mainly for reasons linked to the pandemic. A total of 41.3% had a consultation for psoriasis during lockdown (71.1% by teleconsultation): 39.5% due to worsening of their psoriasis and 21.1% for pandemic-related issues. Among patients not having a consultation during lockdown, 27.5% had a cancellation by the doctor and 9.3% had concerns over going to see the doctor. Finally, 22.8% of patients reported finding it difficult to respect hygiene measures because of their psoriasis, e.g., application of alcohol-based hand sanitizers (47.6%), handwashing routines (42.9%), and wearing a mask (28.6%). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the major clinical impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children with psoriasis.

287503,Lung Ultrasound in COVID-19,2020,"OBJECTIVE: COVID-19 epidemic can be associated with a variety of anxious responses and safety behaviors. The present research explored the psychological implications associated with COVID-19 during the outbreak in 2020 to date. Pakistani media has given particular attention to this outbreak in the region. METHODS: Three hundred and forty-seven undergraduate university students from Pakistan completed a battery of questionnaires focusing fear of COVID-19, associated safety behaviors, factual knowledge of COVID-19, and other psychological pointers hypothesized to be as predictors of anxious responses to COVID-19 threat and associated safety behaviors. RESULTS: The sample appeared to be fearful of COVID-19 and this fear was related to disgust sensitivity, anxiety sensitivity-related physical concerns, body vigilance, contamination cognitions, and general distress. Results suggested that the tendency of overestimating the severity of contamination and anxiety sensitivity towards physical concerns are significant predictors of COVID-19 related fear and consequent safety behaviors. CONCLUSION: It is suggested that people with a greater concern of contamination are likely to respond fearfully to COVID-19 and that people with higher fear of COVID-19 are likely to feel contamination concerns.","Waqas, Muhammad; Hania, Alishba; Hongbo, Li",Psychiatry Investig,,597
287632,The intriguing features of COVID-19 in children and its impact on the pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: First vaccines for prevention of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are becoming available but there is a huge and unmet need for specific forms of treatment. In this study we aimed to evaluate the anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect of siRNA both in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: To identify the most effective molecule out of a panel of 15 in silico designed siRNAs, an in vitro screening system based on vectors expressing SARS-CoV-2 genes fused with the firefly luciferase reporter gene and SARS-CoV-2-infected cells was used. The most potent siRNA, siR-7, was modified by Locked nucleic acids (LNAs) to obtain siR-7-EM with increased stability and was formulated with the peptide dendrimer KK-46 for enhancing cellular uptake to allow topical application by inhalation of the final formulation - siR-7-EM/KK-46. Using the Syrian Hamster model for SARS-CoV-2 infection the antiviral capacity of siR-7-EM/KK-46 complex was evaluated. RESULTS: We identified the siRNA, siR-7, targeting SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) as the most efficient siRNA inhibiting viral replication in vitro. Moreover, we showed that LNA-modification and complexation with the designed peptide dendrimer enhanced the antiviral capacity of siR-7 in vitro. We demonstrated significant reduction of virus titer and lung inflammation in animals exposed to inhalation of siR-7-EM/KK-46 in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, we developed a therapeutic strategy for COVID-19 based on inhalation of a modified siRNA-peptide dendrimer formulation. The developed medication is intended for inhalation treatment of COVID-19 patients.","Khaitov, Musa; Nikonova, Alexandra; Shilovskiy, Igor; Kozhikhova, Ksenia; Kofiadi, Ilya; Vishnyakova, Lyudmila; Nikolskii, Alexander; Gattinger, Pia; Kovchina, Valeria; Barvinskaia, Ekaterina; Yumashev, Kirill; Smirnov, Valeriy; Maerle, Artem; Kozlov, Ivan; Shatilov, Artem; Timofeeva, Anastasiia; Andreev, Sergey; Koloskova, Olesya; Kuznetsova, Nadezhda; Vasina, Daria; Nikiforova, Maria; Rybalkin, Sergei; Sergeev, Ilya; Trofimov, Dmitriy; Martynov, Alexander; Berzin, Igor; Gushchin, Vladimir; Kovalchuk, Aleksey; Borisevich, Sergei; Valenta, Rudolf; Khaitov, Rakhim; Skvortsova, Veronica",Allergy,,597

On March 19, 2020, the County of Los Angeles issued the Safer at Home order as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This curtailed driving and decreased the number of breath alcohol tests that were conducted in Los Angeles County. The number of breath tests conducted in January-February of 2019 and 2020 and March-April of 2019 and 2020 were evaluated using Fisher's exact test and analysis of variance. There was a statistically significant decrease in the overall number of breath tests conducted in Los Angeles County in March-April of 2020. There was also a significant decrease in the number of collisions where DUI was a factor. Accounting for changes in traffic volumes, the number of breath tests per vehicle miles driven also decreased significantly. Since the Safer at Home order closed all non-essential services such as bars and restaurants, there is indirect data on the relative contribution of liquor-serving establishments, and to some extent large social gatherings, to the incidence of drunk driving. Taking into account traffic volume, it was determined that the odds of encountering an intoxicated driver decreased by approximately 23% during the Safer at Home period. This information could help policy-makers determine the likely effectiveness of various countermeasures to prevent drunk driving.","Apodaca, Juan C; Desharnais, Robert A; Mitchell, Lennert J",J. forensic sci,,597

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of results from published studies to date to provide a summary of evidence on detection of COVID-19 by chest CT and the expected CT imaging manifestations. METHODS: Studies were identified by searching PubMed database for articles published between December 2019 and February 2020. Pooled CT positive rate of COVID-19 and pooled incidence of CT imaging findings were estimated using a random-effect model. RESULTS: A total of 13 studies met inclusion criteria. The pooled positive rate of the CT imaging was 89.76% and 90.35% when only including thin-section chest CT. Typical CT signs were ground glass opacities (83.31%), ground glass opacities with mixed consolidation (58.42%), adjacent pleura thickening (52.46%), interlobular septal thickening (48.46%), and air bronchograms (46.46%). Other CT signs included crazy paving pattern (14.81%), pleural effusion (5.88%), bronchiectasis (5.42%), pericardial effusion (4.55%), and lymphadenopathy (3.38%). The most anatomic distributions were bilateral lung infection (78.2%) and peripheral distribution (76.95%). The incidences were highest in the right lower lobe (87.21%), left lower lobe (81.41%), and bilateral lower lobes (65.22%). The right upper lobe (65.22%), right middle lobe (54.95%), and left upper lobe (69.43%) were also commonly involved. The incidence of bilateral upper lobes was 60.87%. A considerable proportion of patients had three or more lobes involved (70.81%). CONCLUSIONS: The detection of COVID-19 chest CT imaging is very high among symptomatic individuals at high risk, especially using thin-section chest CT. The most common CT features in patients affected by COVID-19 included ground glass opacities and consolidation involving the bilateral lungs in a peripheral distribution.","Bao, Cuiping; Liu, Xuehuan; Zhang, Han; Li, Yiming; Liu, Jun",J Am Coll Radiol,,597

A random subset of 2000 tweets was annotated by trained readers to classify tweets according to their content, including telehealth, sentiment, user type, and relation to COVID-19. A state-of-the-art NLP model (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, BERT) was used to categorize the remaining tweets. Following a low and fairly stable level of activity, telehealth tweets rose dramatically beginning the first week of March 2020. The sentiment was overwhelmingly positive or neutral, with only a small percentage of negative tweets. Users included patients, clinicians, vendors (entities that promote the use of telehealth technology or services), and others, which represented the largest category. No significant differences were seen in sentiment across user groups. The COVID-19 pandemic produced a large increase in user tweets related to telehealth and COVID-19, and user sentiment suggests that most people feel positive or neutral about telehealth.","Champagne-Langabeer, T.; Swank, M.

African Americans are disproportionately affected by COVID-19 and more likely to experience severe outcomes relative to other ethnicities. We evaluated the incidence and severity of depression among African American patients within 90 days of recovery from severe COVID-19 infection. Methods We identified African American patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection who received invasive mechanical ventilation at the intensive care unit (ICU) of Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia between May 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020. The patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9), a nine-item questionnaire used to assess depression, and its severity was administered to the patients within 30 to 90 days of hospital discharge. Patients with a history of psychiatric disorders were excluded. We categorized patients into major depressive disorder (MDD) diagnosis or other depression based on their responses. To assess severity, all patients were categorized into none or minimal, mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe based on a score range of 0-27 on the PHQ-9. We calculated the number of patients on treatment for depression as a percentage of the total eligible for treatment based on their PHQ-9 scores. Data analysis was performed using R version 3.6.3 (R Foundation). Results A total of 73 patients completed the questionnaire. The median age of the participants was 52.5 years [IQR 44-65 years] and 65% were males. 44% of the patients had a diagnosis of MDD. The incidence of MDD was higher among females (69%, n=18/26) compared to males (29%, n=14/47), patients aged 55-74 years (60%, n=18/30), &gt; 75 years (66%, n=4/6) compared to younger patients and patients with multiple co-morbidities (45%, n=28/62) compared to patients with only one or no co-morbidity (36%, n=4/11). 27 patients in the study were eligible for treatment based on a PHQ-9 score of at least 14 (moderate and moderately severe depression). However, only 7 of them were receiving some form of depression treatment. The remaining 74% (n=20/27) had not been screened for depression since hospital discharge (Figure 1). ConclusionOur study showed that at least 4 out of 10 African Americans without prior psychiatric illness, hospitalized in the ICU for severe COVID-19 infection will develop MDD within 90 days of discharge. 74% of treatment eligible patients in our study had not been evaluated by a medical professional and were not on any form of treatment.","Olanipekun, T.; Abe, T.; Westney, G.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the humoral response after two doses of mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, in patients with IRD treated with immunomodulating drugs and the impact on IRD activity. METHODS: Consecutive patients treated at the rheumatology institute, who received their first SARS-CoV-2 (Pfizer) vaccine, were recruited to the study, at their routine visit. They were reassessed 4-6 weeks after receiving the second dose of vaccine, and blood samples were obtained for serology. IRD activity assessment and the vaccine side effects were documented during both visits. IgG antibodies (Abs) against SARS-CoV-2 were detected using the SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant (Abbott) assay. RESULTS: Two hundred and sixty-four patients with stable disease, (mean(SD) age 57.6 (13.18) years, disease duration 11.06 (7.42) years), were recruited. The immunomodulatory therapy was not modified before or after the vaccination. After the second vaccination, 227 patients (86%) mounted IgG Ab against SARS-CoV-2 (mean (SD) 5830.8 (8937) AU/mL) and 37 patients (14%) did not, 22/37 were treated with B cell-depleting agents. The reported side effects of the vaccine were minor. The rheumatic disease remained stable in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: The vast majority of patients with IRD developed a significant humoral response following the administration of the second dose of the Pfizer mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 virus. Only minor side effects were reported and no apparent impact on IRD activity was noted.","Braun-Moscovici, Yolanda; Kaplan, Marielle; Braun, Maya; Markovits, Doron; Giryes, Samy; Toledano, Kohava; Tavor, Yonit; Dolnikov, Katya; Balbir-Gurman, Alexandra",Ann. rheum. dis,,597

293791,Addition of Nonauthor Collaborator Names of the COVID-19 Lombardy ICU Network,2021,"Background: Knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs are cognitive outcomes that serve as key determinants of engaging in health behaviors, likely including vaccination and other mitigation behaviors against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Studies have begun examining people's knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about COVID-19, but little is known about how these cognitive outcomes differ across racial/ethnic groups. Methods: An online survey was conducted with a convenience sample of adults ages 18 and older in the United States (n = 2,006) in May 2020, about 2 months after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. Multivariable regression models were used to examine differences in knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about COVID-19 across racial/ethnic groups (non-Latinx white, non-Latinx black, non-Latinx of another race, or Latinx). Results: Knowledge tended to be lower among non-Latinx blacks and Latinx participants compared to non-Latinx whites. For example, fewer non-Latinx blacks responded correctly that COVID-19 is not caused by the same virus that causes influenza (adjusted OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.49-0.90), and Latinx participants were less likely to respond correctly that people with COVID-19 do not always show symptoms of being sick (adjusted OR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.45-0.87). For beliefs and attitudes, non-Latinx blacks (ß = -0.09) and non-Latinx participants of another race (ß = -0.05) reported lower perceived likelihood of getting COVID-19 in the future compared to non-Latinx whites, while Latinx participants reported greater perceived stigma of COVID-19 (ß = 0.08) (all p < 0.05).

294922,Modeling COVID-19 hospital admissions and occupancy in the Netherlands,2021-02-15,"BACKGROUND: Long-term effects of COVID-19, also called Long COVID, affect more than 10% of patients. The most severe cases (i.e. those requiring hospitalization) present a higher frequency of sequelae, but detailed information on these effects is still lacking. The objective of this study is to identify and quantify the frequency and outcomes associated with the presence of sequelae or persistent symptomatology (SPS) during the 6 months after discharge for COVID-19. METHODS: Retrospective observational 6-month follow-up study conducted in four hospitals of Spain. A cohort of all 969 patients who were hospitalized with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 from March 1 to April 15, 2020, was included. We collected all the SPS during the 6 months after discharge reported by patients during follow-up from primary care records. Cluster analyses were performed to validate the measures. The main outcome measures were return to the Emergency Services, hospital readmission and post-discharge death. Surviving patients' outcomes were collected through clinical histories and primary care reports. Multiple logistic regression models were applied. RESULTS: The 797 (82.2%) patients who survived constituted the sample followed, while the rest died from COVID-19. The mean age was 63.0 years, 53.7% of them were men and 509 (63.9%) reported some sequelae during the first 6 months after discharge. These sequelae were very diverse, but the most frequent were respiratory (42.0%), systemic (36.1%), neurological (20.8%), mental health (12.2%) and infectious (7.9%) SPS, with some differences by sex. Women presented higher frequencies of headache and mental health SPS, among others. A total of 160 (20.1%) patients returned to the Emergency Services, 35 (4.4%) required hospital readmission and 8 (1.0%) died during follow-up. The main factors independently associated with the return to Emergency Services were persistent fever, dermatological SPS, arrythmia or palpitations, thoracic pain and pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization during the first wave of the pandemic developed a significant range of mid- to long-term SPS. A detailed list of symptoms and outcomes is provided in this multicentre study. Identification of possible factors associated with these SPS could be useful to optimize preventive follow-up strategies in primary care for the coming months of the pandemic.","Romero-Duarte, Álvaro; Rivera-Izquierdo, Mario; Guerrero-Fernández de Alba, Inmaculada; Pérez-Contreras, Marina; Fernández-Martínez, Nicolás Francisco; Ruiz-Montero, Rafael; Serrano-Ortiz, Álvaro; González-Serna, Rocío Ortiz; Salcedo-Leal, Inmaculada; Jiménez-Mejías, Eladio; Cárdenas-Cruz, Antonio",BMC Med,,597

This data has been analyzed using statistical models such as Poisson and negative binomial models. It is found that a negative binomial regression model is the best fit for our data. Our results reveal that higher population density found to be an important factor for the quick spreading of COVID-19 where it is quite impossible to maintain the social distance and the virus can spread easily.

Importantly, these perceptions may vary according to the characteristics of the consumer (e.g., preferences, motivations), the product (e.g., sensory attributes) and the encounter (e.g., how the meat alternative is presented/framed). Qualitative and quantitative methods were applied to examine consumer perceptions of five proposed alternatives to meat: legumes, tofu, seitan, lab-grown meat, and insects. In Study 1, 138 participants provided free associations with regards to conventional animal proteins (e.g., red/white meat, fish) and the five alternatives. Three profiles of consumers were identified: (1) hedonically motivated meat eaters uninterested in meat substitutes; (2) health-oriented meat eaters open to some meat substitutes; and (3) ethically conscious meat avoiders positively oriented to most meat alternatives. In Study 2, the presentation of the product was experimentally manipulated: 285 participants evaluated the same five meat alternatives along several dimensions (e.g., edibility, healthiness), either when framed as an individual product or as part of a larger meal. Overall, most meat alternatives benefited from a meal framing, with the notable exception of legumes, which benefited from an individual framing, and insects which were evaluated quite negatively regardless of framing. The present findings suggest that there is not a single way to frame all meat alternatives that will improve their appeal to all consumers.","Possidónio, Catarina; Prada, Marília; Graça, João; Piazza, Jared",Appetite,,597

Therefore, the goal of this study was to analyze weekly pharmacy purchases of psychiatric drugs from wholesalers in this country in 2019 and 2020 using data from the IMS RPM® (Regional Pharmaceutical Market) Weekly Database. The outcome was the number of pharmacy purchases of psychiatric drugs per week from wholesalers between Calendar Week 2 and Calendar Week 52 in 2019 and 2020. Calendar Weeks 12 and 51 in 2020 corresponded to the days prior to the first and second German COVID-19 lockdowns, respectively. Descriptively, compared with 2019, the number of weekly pharmacy purchases of psychiatric drugs increased by 32% between Calendar Weeks 2-11 and Calendar Week 12 in 2020, while there was a 9% increase between Calendar Weeks 13-50 and Calendar Week 51 that same year. Overall, the relative increase in the weekly pharmacy purchases of psychiatric drugs from wholesalers was less pronounced before the second COVID-19 lockdown in Germany than before the first.

Among 103,701 shared-shift connections among staff members, 1.4% occurred between persons with COVID-19, a percentage that is significantly higher than the expected 0.9% by random occurrence alone (p<0.001), suggesting that additional transmission occurred within this group. The observed connections among detained persons with COVID-19 were significantly lower than expected (1.0% versus 1.1%, p<0.001) when considering only the housing units in which initial transmission occurred, suggesting that the systematic isolation of persons with COVID-19 is effective at limiting transmission.

Pre-vaccination sera from recovered donors neutralized Wuhan-Hu-1 and sporadically neutralized B.1.351, but a single immunization boosted neutralizing titers against all variants and SARS-CoV-1 by up to 1000-fold. Neutralization was due to antibodies targeting the receptor binding domain and was not boosted by a second immunization.

298664,Adherence to anti-hypertensive treatment on the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes a respiratory disease with a case fatality rate of up to 35%. Given its potential to cause a public health emergency and the absence of efficacious drugs or vaccines, MERS is one of the WHO priority diseases warranting urgent research and development of countermeasures. We aimed to assess safety and tolerability of an anti-MERS-CoV modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA)-based vaccine candidate that expresses the MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein, MVA-MERS-S, in healthy adults. METHODS: This open-label, phase 1 trial was done at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (Hamburg, Germany). Participants were healthy men and women aged 18-55 years with no clinically significant health problems as determined during medical history and physical examination, a body-mass index of 18·5-30·0 kg/m2 and weight of more than 50 kg at screening, and a negative pregnancy test for women. A key exclusion criterion was a previous MVA vaccination. For the prime immunisation, participants received doses of 1â×â107 plaque-forming unit (PFU; low-dose group) or 1â×â108 PFU (high-dose group) MVA-MERS-S intramuscularly. A second identical dose was administered intramuscularly as a booster immunisation 28 days after first injection. As a control group for immunogenicity analyses, blood samples were drawn at identical study timepoints from six healthy adults, who did not receive any injections. The primary objectives of the study were safety and tolerability of the two dosage levels and reactogenicity after administration. Immunogenicity was assessed as a secondary endpoint by ELISA and neutralisation tests. T-cell immunity was evaluated by interferon-Î³-linked enzyme-linked immune absorbent spot assay. All participants who were vaccinated at least once were included in the safety analysis. Immunogenicity was analysed in the participants who completed 6 months of follow-up. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03615911, and EudraCT, 2014-003195-23 FINDINGS: From Dec 17, 2017, to June 5, 2018, 26 participants (14 in the low-dose group and 12 in the high-dose group) were enrolled and received the first dose of the vaccine according to their group allocation. Of these, 23 participants (12 in the low-dose group and 11 in the high-dose group) received a second dose of MVA-MERS-S according to their group allocation after a 28-day interval and completed follow-up. Homologous prime-boost immunisation with MVA-MERS-S revealed a benign safety profile with only transient mild-to-moderate reactogenicity. Participants had no severe or serious adverse events. 67 vaccine-related adverse events were reported in ten (71%) of 14 participants in the low-dose group, and 111 were reported in ten (83%) of 12 participants in the high-dose group. Solicited local reactions were the most common adverse events: pain was observed in 17 (65%; seven in the low-dose group vs ten in the high-dose group) participants, swelling in ten (38%; two vs eight) participants, and induration in ten (38%; one vs nine) participants. Headaches (observed in seven participants in the low-dose group vs nine in the high-dose group) and fatigue or malaise (ten vs seven participants) were the most common solicited systemic adverse events. All adverse events resolved swiftly (within 1-3 days) and without sequelae. Following booster immunisation, nine (75%) of 12 participants in the low-dose group and 11 (100%) participants in the high-dose group showed seroconversion using a MERS-CoV S1 ELISA at any timepoint during the study. Binding antibody titres correlated with MERS-CoV-specific neutralising antibodies (Spearman's correlation r=0·86 [95% CI 0·6960-0·9427], p=0·0001). MERS-CoV spike-specific T-cell responses were detected in ten (83%) of 12 immunised participants in the low-dose group and ten (91%) of 11 immunised participants in the high-dose group. INTERPRETATION: Vaccination with MVA-MERS-S had a favourable safety profile without serious or severe adverse events. Homologous prime-boost immunisation induced humoral and cell-mediated responses against MERS-CoV. A dose-effect relationship was demonstrated for reactogenicity, but not for vaccine-induced immune responses. The data presented here support further clinical testing of MVA-MERS-S in larger cohorts to advance MERS vaccine development.

Although the mutation at the population level had been extensively investigated, how the mutations evolve at the individual level is largely unknown. Eighteen time-series fecal samples were collected from nine patients with COVID-19 during the convalescent phase. The nucleic acids of SARS-CoV-2 were enriched by the hybrid capture method. First, we demonstrated the outstanding performance of the hybrid capture method in detecting intra-host variants. We identified 229 intra-host variants at 182 sites in 18 fecal samples. Among them, nineteen variants presented frequency changes > 0.3 within 1-5 days, reflecting highly dynamic intra-host viral populations. Moreover, the evolution of the viral genome demonstrated that the virus was probably viable in the gastrointestinal tract during the convalescent period. Meanwhile, we also found that the same mutation showed a distinct pattern of frequency changes in different individuals, indicating a strong random drift. In summary, dramatic changes of the SARS-CoV-2 genome were detected in fecal samples during the convalescent period; whether the viral load in feces is sufficient to establish an infection warranted further investigation.","Xu, Yi; Kang, Lu; Shen, Zijie; Li, Xufang; Wu, Weili; Ma, Wentai; Fang, Chunxiao; Yang, Fengxia; Jiang, Xuan; Gong, Sitang; Zhang, Li; Li, Mingkun",J Genet Genomics,,597
301406,Dramatic decrease of laboratory-confirmed influenza A after school closure in response to COVID-19,2020,"Objective: The article focuses on exploring and comparing two top-down methods i.e., media milling and microfluidization for the fabrication of nanocrystals of rifampicin (RIF), a poorly water-soluble drug in terms of their potential for generation of stable and efficacious nanocrystals.Significance: Nanocrystals are often the system of choice for the formulation of poorly water-soluble drugs. The characteristic benefit of nanocrystals lies in their ability to boost the bioavailability of such drugs by enhancing their saturation solubility and dissolution velocity. Nanocrystals can be prepared by either bottom-up or top-down approach. The latter is often preferred due to the feasibility of scale-up and economical nature. Hence the emphasis on these methods.Methods: Stable RIF nanocrystals were developed and optimized using media milling and microfluidizer method by incorporating a suitable surfactant/stabilizer. The developed nanocrystals were evaluated for their saturation solubility, in vitro dissolution, solid-state characteristics, morphology, intrinsic dissolution rate, and short-term physical stability.Results: Both the methods were found to be equally efficient in terms of development of stable RIF nanocrystals, while in terms of processing time and efficacy, microfluidization was found to be advantageous. Amorphization and polymorphic conversion were evident based on the results of solid-state characterization. Furthermore, both formulations exhibited an enhanced solubility and faster dissolution velocity.Conclusions: Based on the characterization outcomes, it can be concluded that both the top-down technologies could be successfully applied to develop nanocrystals of poorly water-soluble drugs. However, microfluidization was found to outplay media milling in terms of processing time and drug loading.","Chogale, Manasi; Gite, Sandip; Patravale, Vandana",Drug Dev Ind Pharm,,597

The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of an individualized internet-based physical activity program on improving physical activity level. Methods This study conducted May-Dec 2018 was a single blind parallel group randomized controlled trial. Participants were recruited by distributing advertisements on popular Persian websites. Participants meeting eligibility criteria were randomly assigned to individualized (N=91) or non-individualized internet-based physical activity (N=93) intervention groups. The designed website for the study included an interactive computer-tailored exercise program that generated progressing physical activity recommendations for individualized intervention group based on the progression process for 10 weeks and a fixed exercise program for non-individualized group. Results Drop outs in the individualized group were 15 and in the non-individualized group were 14. Following the ten-week exercise program, the individualized group's physical activity level according to GPAQ questionnaire assessments was significantly improved in the travel section (p-value &lt;0.001), recreational activities (p-value: 0.036), and total physical activity (p-value &lt;0.001) compared to the beginning of the study. The physical activity level in the travel section (p-value &lt;0.001) and total physical activity (p-value: 0.009), were significantly improved in the individualized group (N=76) compared to the non-individualized group (N=79). No adverse effects were reported. Conclusions Based on the current study, an individualized internet-based physical activity intervention might be effective in improving the level of physical activity. Conducting future studies during the COVID-19 pandemic is mandated to assess the impact.","Noormohammadpour, Pardis Taee Foad Selk-Ghaffari Maryam Taee Farough Mansournia Mohammad Ali Kordi Ramin",European Journal of Integrative Medicine,,597
302596,The dual pandemic of COVID-19 and systemic inequities in US Latino communities,2021,"The roles of conspiracy beliefs and political trust for public health behaviour have seldomly been studied prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we tested whether conspiracy beliefs affect containment-related behaviour in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic and whether this relationship is mediated by political trust, preference for saving the economy or for saving lives. The data were collected at two time points, at the beginning of the epidemic and after the state of emergency was introduced. The sample consisted of 790 adults from Serbia (349 at time 1 and 441 at time 2), of which around 60% were female, with a mean age of around 33. The results indicate that holding more conspiracy beliefs is related to less adherence to containment-related behaviour, both directly and indirectly, via decreased political trust. Preference for saving lives has a direct effect on containment-related behaviour, while preference for saving economy plays no important role in this relationship, although it has a negative zero-order association with containment-related behaviour. The findings are interpreted in light of the importance of governmental pandemic management for containing, i.e. preventing the spread of infectious diseases.","Karic, Tijana; Mededovic, Janko",Pers Individ Dif,,597

This study aimed to explore the trajectories of perinatal depressive symptoms, their heterogeneity of onsets and peaks, and relations to demographic and psychological factors. METHOD: A longitudinal study was conducted at two hospitals in China amongst 1,126 participants. Perinatal depression was measured using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Demographic and psychological factors were collected by self-developed questionnaire and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7. Women completing at least three depression screens (n = 879) were included. Latent Growth Curve Model and Growth Mixture Model were performed to identify the depression trajectories and logistic regression was used to analyse factors of trajectories. RESULTS: Three trajectories were identified: 90.0% of women never presented with depressive symptoms (""Low-throughout""); 5.1% presented with depressive symptoms mainly during the antenatal period (""Antenatal-high""); 4.9% presented with depressive symptoms mainly during the postpartum period (""Postpartum-high""). 52.4% of women experienced their first depressive symptoms during early pregnancy. Suffering from anxiety and being unsatisfied with their marriage were associated with the ""Antenatal-high"" and ""Postpartum-high"" trajectories, respectively. LIMITATIONS: Response rate was not high. We also do not have information on clinical diagnoses or changes in some variables over time. CONCLUSIONS: We identified three trajectories and heterogeneity existed concerning the timing of their peaks. Women should be considered for depression screening and intervention in early pregnancy. Factors associated with each trajectory were different, raising the potential of individualized intervention to reduce the occurrence of depression.","Yu, Min; Li, Hui; Xu, Dong Roman; Wu, Yinglan; Liu, Hua; Gong, Wenjie",J Affect Disord,,597

There is sudden need of statistical modeling due to onset of COVID-19 pandemic across the world. But health planning and policy requirements need the estimates of disease problem from clinical data. Objective: The present study aimed to predict the declination of COVID-19 using recovery rate and case load rate on basis of available data from India. Methods: The reported COVID-19 cases in the country were obtained from website (https://datahub.io/core/covid-19#resource-covid-19_zip/). The confirmed cases, recovered cases and deaths were used for estimating recovery rate, case load rate and death rate till June 04, 2020. Results: A total of 216919 confirmed cases were reported nationwide in India on June 04, 2020. It is found that the recovery rate increased to 47.99% and case load rate decreased to 49.21%. Death rate is found to be very low 2.80%. Accordingly, coincidence of the difference of case load rate and recovery rate (delta) will reveal a declination in expected COVID-19 cases. Conclusion: The epidemic in the country was mainly caused by the movement of people from various foreign countries to India. Lockdown as restricting the migration of population and decision taken by the government to quarantine the population may greatly reduce the risk of continued spread of the epidemic in India. This study predicts that when the case load rate gets lesser than recovery rate, there after COVID-19 patients would be started to decline.","Bhattacharjee, Atanu; Kumar, Mukesh; Patel, Kamalesh Kumar",,,597

Besides, possessing several advantages of MSC-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) over MSCs, EV-based therapy also holds potential therapeutic effects in respiratory virus infection. In this review, we summarized the basic characteristics and mechanisms of COVID-19 and MSCs, outlined some preclinical and clinical studies of MSCs or MSC-EVs for respiratory virus infection such as influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2, shed light on the common problems that we should overcome to translate MSC therapy into clinical application, and discussed some safe issues related to the use of MSCs.","Xiong, Jing; Chen, Long; Zhang, Li; Bao, Lei; Shi, Yuan",Cell Transplant,,597

Research Design & Methods: Gaussian Mixture Modelling and Factor Analysis: the main design is quantitative, using Gaussian Mixture Modelling to find the optimal number of country clusters, and Factor Analysis with Principal Axis Factoring (FA-PAF) to build a composite index of governmental policies. Data includes eight mitigation policy variables and three supporting economic policy variables. Data are aggregated to form three periods and the cluster changes are identified by Gaussian Mixture Modelling. Then, the Covid Mitigation Index (CMI) is constructed by FA-PAF to obtain a comparative measure over the periods and the country clusters. The results were obtained by means of R studio and SPSS. Findings: The dynamic clustering leads to a decreasing number of clusters from nine clusters in the first period (January-February 2020), four clusters in the second period (March-April 2020), and two clusters in the third period (May-June 2020). In the first period, China (with CMI=48) took serious actions forming its own cluster, while 11 other countries (with CMI&gt;10), e.g., early affected European countries such as Italy and Spain and large Asian countries such India and Indonesia, took moderate actions. In the second period all cluster averages were greater than China's in the first period, i.e., most world countries were dedicated to fight Covid-19. In Europe, Italy, San Marino and France showed the highest CMI values, similarly to Iraq and Palestine in the Middle East, Peru and Honduras in the Latin America, and China, India and Indonesia in Asia. In the third period, cluster averages showed even tighter policies even though 42 countries had lower CMI values than previously. Implications & Recommendations: The approach provided a big picture for decision makers both in business and in governments. The key idea was to reveal reference groups of countries which help governmental actors to design and adapt their strategies over time by learning by their own experience and the results of the better performing clusters. It was suggested that a multi-criteria approach accounting for individual government's preferences over health and economy is used along with the presented approach. Contribution & Value Added: Clustering with Gaussian Mixture Models and factor analysis based on Principal Axis Factoring for composite-index building were used. The methods are well-established, but they were applied in a novel way dynamically over time and for the composite CMI. CMI was built on two factors which identified the structure of mitigation policies and economic policies. The development of governmental polices over the first cycle of Covid-19 pandemic was described.","Kinnunen, J.; Georgescu, I.; Hosseini, Z.; Androniceanu, A.

305609,Systematic Observation of Mask Adherence and Distancing (SOMAD):Findings from Philadelphia,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Published in July 2013 NICE Clinical Guidelines 168 (CG168) recommended that people with bleeding varicose veins should be referred immediately to a vascular service. We have examined the impact of CG168 on referral practice for patients with bleeding varicose veins from primary to secondary care in a local NHS service. METHODS: Referrals to a local vascular service in the 6 years before (Group 1) and 6 years after (Group 2) publication of CG168 were analysed to assess patients' management following a bleed, with particular reference to a patient's initial presentation and delays in referral to the vascular service. This was done by retrospective electronic database and case-note interrogation of patients presenting with bleeding varicose veins. Relevant data was collected onto an Excel spread sheet in relation to demographic information, comorbidities, clinical presentation and treatment pathway. RESULTS: 73 patients presented with bleeding varicose veins during the period studied. Their mean age was 66 and 56% were men. Their mean BMI was 28. Of note Thirty-three patients (45%) initially self-treated, before going to see their General Practitioner (GP), another 18 (25%) went to the Emergency department (ED). In 51 patients (70%) the underlying superficial pathology involved the great saphenous vein (GSV) and most patients (73%) were treated with foam sclerotherapy with or without truncal thermal ablation. 45 patients (Group 1) were treated in the 6 years before CG168 and 28 patients, allowing 6 months for dissemination, were treated in the 6 years after CG168 (Group 2). Mean time from index bleed to referral to the vascular service was faster after CG168 (84 days pre and 20 days post CG168). P=0.00842. Publication of CG168 was also associated with reduced mean bleed to intervention times (194 vs 60 days P=0.00097). CONCLUSIONS: Publication of UK NICE guidelines CG 168 has been associated with a significant reduction in the delay to referral of patients presenting with bleeding varicose veins however the goal of immediate referral to a vascular service is not being met. CG168 is likely to have been a significant component of the factors that have led to the improvements seen thus far.","Cragg, James; Nyamekye, Isaac",J. Vasc. Surg. Venous Lymphat. Disord,,597

306486,Increase in Alcoholic Hepatitis Cases during Covid Pandemic in the Us,2021,"We present two different approaches for modeling the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Both approaches are based on the population classes susceptible, exposed, infectious, quarantined, and recovered and allow for an arbitrary number of subgroups with different infection rates and different levels of testing. The first model is derived from a set of ordinary differential equations that incorporates the rates at which population transitions take place among classes. The other is a particle model, which is a specific case of crowd simulation model, in which the disease is transmitted through particle collisions and infection rates are varied by adjusting the particle velocities. The parameters of these two models are tuned using information on COVID-19 from the literature and country-specific data, including the effect of restrictions as they were imposed and lifted. We demonstrate the applicability of both models using data from Cyprus, for which we find that both models yield very similar results, giving confidence in the predictions.","Alexandrou, Constantia; Harmandaris, Vangelis; Irakleous, Anastasios; Koutsou, Giannis; Savva, Nikos",PLoS One,,597
306502,The Toll of COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: To track and reduce the spread of COVID-19, apps have been developed to identify contact with individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 and warn those who are at risk of having contracted the virus. However, the effectiveness of these apps depends highly on their uptake by the general population. OBJECTIVE: The present study investigated factors influencing app use intention, based on the health belief model. In addition, associations with respondents' level of news consumption and their health condition were investigated. METHODS: A survey was administered in Flanders, Belgium, to 1500 respondents, aged 18 to 64 years. Structural equation modeling was used to investigate relationships across the model's constructs. RESULTS: In total, 48.70% (n=730) of respondents indicated that they intend to use a COVID-19 tracing app. The most important predictor was the perceived benefits of the app, followed by self-efficacy and perceived barriers. Perceived severity and perceived susceptibility were not related to app uptake intention. Moreover, cues to action (ie, individuals' exposure to [digital] media content) were positively associated with app use intention. As the respondents' age increased, their perceived benefits and self-efficacy for app usage decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Initiatives to stimulate the uptake of contact tracing apps should enhance perceived benefits and self-efficacy. A perceived barrier for some potential users is privacy concerns. Therefore, when developing and launching an app, clarification on how individuals' privacy will be protected is needed. To sustain perceived benefits in the long run, supplementary options could be integrated to inform and assist users.","Walrave, Michel; Waeterloos, Cato; Ponnet, Koen",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,597
306611,Changes in patient behavior during COVID-19: What I've observed,2020,"Coping with the COVID-19 pandemic has been painful and no single model for such a purpose is perfect. However, sharing experiences is the best way for countries to learn real-time lessons and adapt to this rapidly changing pandemic. This commentary shares with the international community how an adaptive model of health system organization and responses helped Vietnam to break transmission of coronavirus. We find that an effective model is adaptive to time and context, and mobilizes and engages the wider society. We identify merging of different health system units into Center for Diseases Controls as a health system organization that saved massive resources. The early establishment of a formal committee responding to the pandemic helped unify every public health strategy. The mobilization of different stakeholders and communities added resources and facilitated a synchronous implementation of response strategies, even where those strategies involved significant personal or financial sacrifice. National training on Covid-19 treatment for healthcare professionals across the entire hospital system was useful to expand the health service availability. Quickly published response guidelines helped to activate every level of the health system and involve every sector of society. A strategy of keeping high alert and preemptive action is also essential for coping with the pandemic.","Van Nguyen, Huy; Van Hoang, Minh; Dao, An Thi Minh; Nguyen, Hoa L; Van Nguyen, Tien; Nguyen, Phuong The; Khuong, Long Quynh; Le, Phuong Mai; Gilmour, Stuart",Int J Health Plann Manage,,597
306671,"When Crisis Strikes, Handle With CARE",2021,"Background and Aim: The discovery of drugs capable of inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 is a priority for human beings due to the severity of the global health pandemic caused by COVID-19. To this end, natural products can provide therapeutic alternatives that could be employed as an effective safe treatment for COVID-19. Experimental procedure: Twelve compounds were isolated from the aerial parts of C. officinalis L. and investigated for their inhibitory activities against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro compared to its co-crystallized N3 inhibitor using molecular docking studies. Furthermore, a 100 ns MD simulation was performed for the most active two promising compounds, Calendulaglycoside A (SAP5) and Osteosaponin-I (SAP8). Results and Conclusion: At first, molecular docking studies showed interesting binding scores as compared to the N3 inhibitor. Calendulaglycoside A (SAP5) achieved a superior binding than the co-crystallized inhibitor indicating promising affinity and intrinsic activity towards the Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 as well. Moreover, findings illustrated preferential stability for SAP5 within the Mpro pocket over that of N3 beyond the 40 ns MD simulation course. Structural preferentiality for triterpene-Mpro binding highlights the significant role of 17ß-glucosyl and carboxylic 3&#945;-galactosyl I moieties through high electrostatic interactions across the MD simulation trajectories. Furthermore, this study clarified a promising SAR responsible for the antiviral activity against the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and the design of new drug candidates targeting it as well. The above findings could be promising for fast examining the previously isolated triterpenes both pre-clinically and clinically for the treatment of COVID-19.","Zaki, Ahmed A; Ashour, Ahmed; Elhady, Sameh S; Darwish, Khaled M; Al-Karmalawy, Ahmed A",Journal of traditional and complementary medicine,,597

Here we report the use of remdesivir in a patient with COVID-19 and the prototypic genetic antibody deficiency X-linked agammaglobulinaemia (XLA). Despite evidence of complement activation and a robust T cell response, the patient developed persistent SARS-CoV-2 pneumonitis, without progressing to multi-organ involvement. This unusual clinical course is consistent with a contribution of antibodies to both viral clearance and progression to severe disease. In the absence of these confounders, we take an experimental medicine approach to examine the in vivo utility of remdesivir. Over two independent courses of treatment, we observe a temporally correlated clinical and virological response, leading to clinical resolution and viral clearance, with no evidence of acquired drug resistance. We therefore provide evidence for the antiviral efficacy of remdesivir in vivo, and its potential benefit in selected patients.","Buckland, Matthew S; Galloway, James B; Fhogartaigh, Caoimhe Nic; Meredith, Luke; Provine, Nicholas M; Bloor, Stuart; Ogbe, Ane; Zelek, Wioleta M; Smielewska, Anna; Yakovleva, Anna; Mann, Tiffeney; Bergamaschi, Laura; Turner, Lorinda; Mescia, Frederica; Toonen, Erik J M; Hackstein, Carl-Philipp; Akther, Hossain Delowar; Vieira, Vinicius Adriano; Ceron-Gutierrez, Lourdes; Periselneris, Jimstan; Kiani-Alikhan, Sorena; Grigoriadou, Sofia; Vaghela, Devan; Lear, Sara E; Török, M Estée; Hamilton, William L; Stockton, Joanne; Quick, Josh; Nelson, Peter; Hunter, Michael; Coulter, Tanya I; Devlin, Lisa; Bradley, John R; Smith, Kenneth G C; Ouwehand, Willem H; Estcourt, Lise; Harvala, Heli; Roberts, David J; Wilkinson, Ian B; Screaton, Nick; Loman, Nicholas; Doffinger, Rainer; Lyons, Paul A; Morgan, B Paul; Goodfellow, Ian G; Klenerman, Paul; Lehner, Paul J; Matheson, Nicholas J; Thaventhiran, James E D",Nat Commun,,597

The TEXAS Coronavirus Antibody REsponse Survey (CARES) is a statewide seroprevalence program which utilizes the Roche S-test to detect antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the Roche N-test to detect antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein, to monitor the combined impact of prior infection and the COVID-19 vaccine. The current sample size having both S- and N-test data and reported vaccination status is 8,846. Participants with prior infection (i.e. N+) and with either partial or full vaccination have the highest proportion of those showing the maximum value of the S-test (80.95% and 83.07%, respectively). Using a permutation test, there is no statistically significant difference between the median S-test value for those that have had prior infection and are partially vaccinated versus those that have had prior infection and are fully vaccinated. These groups both show significantly higher median amount compared to the other three groups: N+/not vaccinated, N-/partially vaccinated, and N-/fully vaccinated (all p-values < 0.0001). Unvaccinated individuals with prior infection have one of the lowest median S-test values. For participants with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and a COVID-19 vaccine, the median S-test value is high and is not statistically different between those who are partially vaccinated and those who are fully vaccinated.","Boerwinkle, Eric; Shuford, Jennifer A; Swartz, Michael D; Lakey, David L; Aguillard, Kimberly A; Pont, Stephen J; Valerio-Shewmaker, Melissa A",,,597

308090,Factors that affect the performance of covid-19 infection management administration in general hospitals,2021,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Patients with rheumatic disease taking long-term disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are expected to have a higher risk of infection due to the alterations in cellular immunity associated with these medications. However, the potential risks associated with these drugs remain unclear. This study aimed to estimate the risk of COVID-19 infection in patients with rheumatic disease taking disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. METHODS: Patients with autoimmune rheumatic disease taking DMARDs with or without long-term (> 6 months) HCQ treatment prior to the COVID-19 outbreak were selected consecutively. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was made based on the history of symptoms suggestive of the disease and/or serum IgG positivity. During statistical analysis, the risk of COVID-19 infection was calculated in rheumatic patients taking DMARDs versus controls, as well as in patients taking HCQ versus those who are not. The ORs and 95% CIs were also calculated. The participants in the control group were selected from individuals without RD. RESULTS: A total of 800 patients with RD and 449 controls were analyzed. COVID-19 infection was detected in 16.8% of rheumatic patients versus 17.6% of controls (OR 0.95; 95% CI 0.7-1.28). The proportions of COVID-19 infection in HCQ users versus non-users were 15.3% and 18.1%, respectively (OR 0.87; 95% CI 0.61-1.26). These results remained unchanged after adjusting for all covariates using logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that rheumatic patients taking DMARDs are not at a higher risk of COVID-19 infection, and that HCQ therapy has no influence on the risk of COVID-19 infection. Key points â¢ The risk of COVID-19 infection is not higher in patients with RD on DMARD therapy. â¢ The prevalence of COVID-19 infection in HCQ users has not significant difference relative to non-users. â¢ Significant percent of RD patients taking DMARDs had asymptomatic infection. â¢ There was a positive association between leflunamide therapy and the risk of COVID-19 infection.","Yousefghahari, Behnaz; Navari, Sanaz; Sadeghi, Mahmoud; Soleimaniamiri, Shima; Soleimaniamiri, Mohammadjafar; Heidari, Behzad; Babaei, Mansour; Ghodrati, Kian; Guran, Ardeshir; Gholinia, Hemmat",Clin. rheumatol,,597

An accurate estimate of this fraction is crucial for the assessment of the situation and the establishment of protective measures. In most current studies using epidemics models, the total number of infected is either approximated by the number of diagnosed individuals or is dependent on the model parameters and assumptions, which are often debated. We here study the relationship between the fraction of diagnosed infected out of all infected, and the fraction of infected with known contaminator out of all diagnosed infected. We show that those two are approximately the same in exponential models and across most models currently used in the study of epidemics, independently of the model parameters. As an application, we compute an estimate of the effective number of infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus in various countries.","Melka, Akiva Bruno; Louzoun, Yoram",Sci Rep,,597

As a significant public health threat, it has spread worldwide. Scientists and global health experts are collaborating to find and execute speedy diagnostics, robust and highly effective vaccines, and therapeutic techniques to tackle COVID-19. The ocean is an immense source of biologically active molecules and/or compounds with antiviral-associated biopharmaceutical and immunostimulatory attributes. Some specific algae-derived molecules can be used to produce antibodies and vaccines to treat the COVID-19 disease. Algae have successfully synthesized several metabolites as natural defense compounds that enable them to survive under extreme environments. Several algae-derived bioactive molecules and/or compounds can be used against many diseases, including microbial and viral infections. Moreover, some algae species can also improve immunity and suppress human viral activity. Therefore, they may be recommended for use as a preventive remedy against COVID-19. Considering the above critiques and unique attributes, herein, we aimed to systematically assess algae-derived, biologically active molecules that could be used against this disease by looking at their natural sources, mechanisms of action, and prior pharmacological uses. This review also serves as a starting point for this research area to accelerate the establishment of anti-SARS-CoV-2 bioproducts.","Alam, Md Asraful; Parra-Saldivar, Roberto; Bilal, Muhammad; Afroze, Chowdhury Alfi; Ahmed, Md Nasir; Iqbal, Hafiz M N; Xu, Jingliang",Molecules (Basel),,597

Since neutrophils are the major component of innate immunity, we hypothesize that the quantum of activated neutrophils in the blood may predict an adverse outcome. DESIGN: In a retrospective study of 300 adult patients with confirmed COVID-19, we analyzed the impact of neutrophil activation (NEUT-RI), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and the established clinical risk factors of age, diabetes, obesity and hypertension on the clinical outcome. RESULTS: Significant predictors of the need for mechanical ventilation were NEUT-RI (Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.22, P < 0.001), diabetes (OR = 2.56, P = 0.00846) and obesity (OR = 6.55, P < 0.001). For death, the significant predictors were NEUT-RI (OR = 1.14, P = 0.00432), diabetes (OR = 4.11, P = 0.00185) and age (OR = 1.04, P = 0.00896). The optimal cut-off value for NEUT-RI to predict mechanical ventilation and death was 52 fluorescence intensity units (sensitivity 44%, specificity 88%, area under the curve 0.67 and 44%, 86%, 0.64, respectively). CONCLUSION: This finding supports an aberrant neutrophil response in COVID-19, likely due to uncontained viral replication, tissue hypoxia and exacerbated inflammation, introduces a novel biomarker for rapid monitoring and opens new avenues for therapeutic strategies.","Dennison, David; Al Khabori, Murtadha; Al Mamari, Sahimah; Aurelio, Allan; Al Hinai, Houda; Al Maamari, Khuloud; Alshekaili, Jalila; Al Khadouri, Ghalib",Int J Infect Dis,,597

311297,Worse progression of COVID-19 in men: Is testosterone a key factor?,2020,"This research note sheds light on the first three months of the COVID-19 outbreak in South Africa, where the virus has spread faster than anywhere else in the region At the same time, South Africa has been recognized globally for its swift and efficient early response We consider the impact of this response on different segments of the population, looking at changes in mobility by province to highlight variation in the willingness and ability of different subsets of the population to comply with lockdown orders Using anonymized mobile phone data, we show that South Africans in all provinces reduced their mobility substantially in response to the government’s lockdown orders Statistical regression analysis shows that such mobility reductions are significantly and negatively associated with COVID-19 growth rates two weeks later These findings add an important perspective to the emerging literature on the efficacy of shelter-in-place orders, which to date is dominated by studies of the United States We show that people were particularly willing and able to act in the provinces hit hardest by the pandemic in its initial stages At the same time, compliance with lockdown orders presented a greater challenge among rural populations and others with more precarious livelihoods By reflecting on South Africa’s inequality profile and results of a recent survey, we demonstrate how the country’s response may deepen preexisting divides This cautionary tale is relevant beyond South Africa, as much of the continent -- and the world -- grapples with similar tradeoffs Along with measures to contain the spread of disease, governments and other development focused organizations should seriously consider how to offset the costs faced by already marginalized populations","Carlitz, Ruth D.; Makhura, Moraka N.",World Development,,597

Studies have found that particle exposure is closely related to cardiovascular disease. In addition, there have been many reports that nanomaterials can enter the heart tissue, accumulate and then cause damage. Therefore, in the present article, literature related to nanomaterials-induced cardiotoxicity in recent years was collected from the PubMed database, and then organized and summarized to form a review. This article mainly discusses heart damage caused by nanomaterials from the following three aspects: Firstly, we summarize the research 8 carbon nanotubes, etc. Secondly, we discuss in depth the possible underlying mechanism of the damage to the heart caused by nanoparticles. Oxidative stress damage, mitochondrial damage, inflammation and apoptosis have been found to be key factors. Finally, we summarize the current research models used to evaluate the cardiotoxicity of nanomaterials, highlight reliable emerging technologies and in vitro models that have been used for toxicity evaluation of environmental pollutants in recent years, and indicate their application prospects.","Cheng, Yanping; Chen, Zaozao; Yang, Sheng; Liu, Tong; Yin, Lihong; Pu, Yuepu; Liang, Geyu",Sci Total Environ,,597

The pandemic began in China and has spread throughout the world. This new coronavirus has a high transmission capacity and elevated lethality in people over 60 years old and in those with risk factors (obesity, diabetes, and systemic arterial hypertension); those characteristics have a different proportion in each country. At present, there is no specific, effective, and safe treatment to treat this virus. In this review, an analysis is made on the differences in epidemiological aspects of the disease and its presentation in pediatric patients; the poorly-based recommendation for using an empirical combination of antimalarials plus antimicrobials as antiviral treatment; the indication of intravenous steroids; and the possible influence of antihypertensive drugs on the course of the disease.","Márquez-González, Horacio; Miranda-Novales, María G; Solórzano-Santos, Fortino; Klunder-Klunder, Miguel; Garduño-Espinoza, Juan; Méndez-Galván, Jorge F",Bol Med Hosp Infant Mex,,597

Each day, users post millions of tweets and comments on this subject, which contain significant implicit information about the public opinion. In this regard, a dataset of COVID-related tweets in English language is collected, which consists of more than two million tweets from March 23 to June 23 of 2020 to extract the feelings of the people in various countries in the early stages of this outbreak. To this end, first, we use a lexicon-based approach in conjunction with the GeoNames geographic database to label the tweets with their locations. Next, a method based on the recently introduced and widely cited RoBERTa model is proposed to analyze their sentimental content. After that, the trend graphs of the frequency of tweets as well as sentiments are produced for the world and the nations that were more engaged with COVID-19. Graph analysis shows that the frequency graphs of the tweets for the majority of nations are significantly correlated with the official statistics of the daily afflicted in them. Moreover, several implicit knowledge is extracted and discussed.","Vahdat-Nejad, Hamed; Salmani, Fatemeh; Hajiabadi, Mahdi; Azizi, Faezeh; Abbasi, Sajedeh; Jamalian, Mohadese; Mosafer, Reyhane; Hajiabadi, Hamideh",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.06151v1.pdf,597
312819,Prone positioning for patients intubated for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to COVID-19: a retrospective observational cohort study,2020,"This research aims to study the alteration of spatial pollution compounds to the eutrophication phenomenon in water resources during the COVID-19 situation. Sixteen water resources were monitored to examine the impact of spatial pollution compound on eutrophication phenomenon discovered from the activities of the Valaya Alongkorn Rajabhat University under the Royal Patronage. The analytical parameters were DO, nitrite (NO2-), nitrate (NO3-), ammonia (NH3), phosphate (PO4-), and Total kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) collected in three months (November 2020, January 2021, and March 2021). This research has presented the differences in water resource characters in three months and the positive impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on wastewater. The total nitrogen was highest in November 2020 when compared with that of in January and March 2021 because it was a ‘normal situation’ (no lockdown) in November. The student, officer, lecturer, and government visitors came to use the facilities of the university. The results of total kjeldahl nitrogen showed a high range during the working period. The effect of P was higher on the water bodies in November than January and March because in November was a normal situation (no lockdown). The N:P ratio showed different trends to the eutrophication phenomenon with nitrogen and phosphate. Therefore, a comparison between a situation with lockdown and no lockdown showed that the lockdown situation was environment friendly. Finally, the results also confirm an improvement in environmental quality, which happened when humans were absent, especially in coronavirus circumstances. © 2021 by ASERS® Publishing.

METHODS: A total of 45 patients with CF and their mothers were enrolled in the study together with 90 age-matched healthy children and their mothers as a control group. The State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was administered by teleconference with children aged 13 to 18 years old and their mothers. The STAI for children was administered with children aged 9 to 12 years. Results were compared with age-matched healthy children and their mothers. The relationship between anxiety scores of children with CF and their mothers was evaluated by comparing with clinical data of children with CF. At the conclusion of the teleconference, mothers were asked whether their anxiety had changed as a result of the interview. RESULTS: It was found that healthy children aged 13 to 18 years had higher state anxiety scores than age-matched children with CF. Mothers of children with CF had higher trait anxiety scores, especially those of children aged 0 to 12 years, than mothers of healthy children (P < .05). For mothers of children with CF, state anxiety scores were higher among those whose children had chronic Pseudomonas infection (P < .05). Most mothers of children with CF stated that their anxiety decreased following the interview. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic may increase anxiety among mothers of children with CF as well those with healthy children. However, COVID-19 had no effect on the anxiety of children with CF. Informing parents of children with CF about COVID-19 by teleconference may decrease anxiety.","Pinar Senkalfa, Burcu; Sismanlar Eyuboglu, Tugba; Aslan, Ayse T; Ramasli Gursoy, Tugba; Soysal, Azime S; Yapar, Dilek; Ilhan, Mustafa N",Pediatr. pulmonol,,597

314167,Covid-19 Maternal-Neonate Vertical Transmission Rates in Los Angeles County,2020,"Background: Currently, there is an unmet clinical need in identifying and screening women at high risk of breast cancer, where tumours are often aggressive and treatment intervention is too late to prevent metastasis, recurrence and mortality. This has been brought into sharp focus by the SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic, constantly changing hospital policies and surgical guidelines in reducing access to established screening and treatment regimens. Nipple aspirate fluid (NAF), is thought to provide a unique window into the biological processes occurring within the breast, particularly in the context of a developing neoplasm. Evaluation of NAF in asymptomatic women, for novel chemical biomarkers of either early disease and/or cancer risk offers tremendous promise as a tool to facilitate early detection and to supplement screening. However, it is acceptability as a method of collection and screening by women is critical and yet unknown. A breast health questionnaire was disseminated to women through breast cancer charities, patient support groups and social media platforms, with the aim of collecting opinions on the acceptability of use of NAF as a potential screening tool. Method: Following ethical approval a questionnaire was prepared using online surveys consisting of four parts: (a) introduction on breast health screening in the UK, (b) core demographic data, (c) questions regarding screening and the acceptability of using NAF and (d) opinions about the process of collecting and using nipple fluid for screening. The voluntary and anonymous questionnaire was disseminated through social media, professional networks, charity websites and by individuals between October 2019 and December 2020. Survey responses were collected electronically, and the data analysed using online surveys statistical tools. Results: A total of 3178 women completed the questionnaire (65.9% Caucasian, 27.7% Asian/British Asian, 0.6% black and 5.0% other). Of these, 2650 women (83.4%) had no prior knowledge of NAF and 89.4% were unaware that NAF can be expressed in up to 90% of all women. Concerning their risk of breast cancer, 89.8% of women were keen to know their future risk of breast cancer, 8.5% were unsure whether they wanted to know their risk and a further, 1.6% did not want to know. Regarding screening, 944 women (29.8%) were unaware of the lack of routine National Health Service Breast Screening for those under the age of 47 years. Furthermore, 53.0% of women were unaware that mammographic screening is affected by breast density. In terms of the acceptability of home testing for breast health, 92.0% were keen to undergo a home test. Both 79.7% and 70.9% stated they would consider hand massage and a breast pump to acquire nipple fluid samples, respectively. A further 48.6% of women would consider the use of a hormonal nasal spray for the same purpose. However, with regards to acquiring results from NAF testing, 42.6% of women would prefer to receive results at home and 34.2% in a medical facility. Finally, 91.6% of women believed that breast health should be incorporated as part of school education curriculum. Conclusion: Public awareness regarding breast screening protocols and limitations of mammography could be improved. Many women were unaware that NAF might be a useful biofluid for future risk prediction, and yet the concept of self-testing of nipple fluid, with either hand massage or a breast pump was well received. Efforts should be made to increase awareness of the benefits of alternative and supplementary tests, especially in the context of high-risk individuals and younger patients. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

316741,Public Reporting of COVID-19 Management,2020,"BACKGROUND: A virtual oral health care help line was established to provide consultation and triage for people with dental questions and concerns. Its goal during a pandemic was to keep patients from seeking unnecessary in-person care from emergency departments and urgent care clinics, especially when dental practices were closed or limited to providing essential urgent and emergency oral health care. METHODS: The Adams School of Dentistry, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, developed the Carolina Dentistry Virtual Oral Health Care Helpline using a quality improvement framework with faculty and staff member feedback. The process included establishing infrastructure (phone, video, protocols, referrals, documentation), personnel (scheduling, training, calibration), and internal and external communication. The authors collected retrospective information for descriptive evaluation of the first month's operations. RESULTS: There were 337 telephone calls answered, of which 65 (19%) were administrative and 272 (81%) were related to dental concerns. Dental pain (54%) was the most prevalent reason for calling. Triage and Providers referred 107 of 175 callers (61%) to the school's urgent care center. Of the 79 callers who received teleconsultations from virtual providers, 33 (42%) did not require additional follow-up, and 7 (9%) needed a follow-up phone call. Overall, 4 people were referred to community clinics, and 4 were referred to the emergency department. CONCLUSIONS: The Helpline was launched quickly and improved through quality improvement cycles, and it provided a needed community dental service. The process resolved some patient concerns without their seeking urgent or emergency care. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The pandemic has increased teledentistry practice. The authors describe establishing a dental school's virtual oral health Helpline, which provides a framework for dental practices seeking to use this patient communication modality.","Weintraub, Jane A; Quinonez, Rocio B; Smith, Avie Jackson Thompson; Ciarrocca, Katharine; Fouad, Ashraf F; Shazib, Muhammad Ali; Kraszeski, Marlene M; Rankin, David B; Matthews, N Shaun",J Am Dent Assoc,,597
317079,Commentary. Eliminating vitamin D deficiency during the COVID-19 pandemic: A call to action,2020,"The new Coronavirus has challenged modern medicine. The disease caused by this virus, COVID-19, is characterized by a high rate of lethality, especially in the older age group. There is still no vaccine and no specific treatment, therefore prevention remains the main way to fight the virus. SARS-COV-2 is characterized by high virulence and contagiousness, that's why the main preventive recommendation is social distance.

In this study, a dataset of Arabic COVID-19 related tweets was collected, which fell in the period of the curfew. The dataset was processed, based on several machine learning predictive models: Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), and Naïve Bayes (NB), along with the N-gram feature extraction technique. The results show that applying the SVM classifier along with bigram in Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) outperformed other models with an accuracy of 85%. The results of awareness prediction showed that the south region observed the highest level of awareness towards COVID-19 containment measures, whereas the middle region was the least. The proposed model can support the medical sectors and decision-makers to decide the appropriate procedures for each region based on their attitudes towards the pandemic.","Aljameel, Sumayh S; Alabbad, Dina A; Alzahrani, Norah A; Alqarni, Shouq M; Alamoudi, Fatimah A; Babili, Lana M; Aljaafary, Somiah K; Alshamrani, Fatima M",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,597

The case group consisted of 72 males and 28 females. 40 healthy adults without any history or clinical evidence suggestive of COVID-19 and without any comorbidities, like diabetes, hypertension chronic lung disease, cardiac disease, cancer, and immune-compromised individuals were considered as a control group for the study. Routine laboratory findings of these 100 patients were used to evaluate the abnormalities found in COVID-19 patients. Statistical analysis was carried out on the data after determining whether the data had a normal/log-normal distribution and their significance was determined by calculating the p-value. The percentage of patients showing a decrease or increase from the normal value was calculated. Trend analysis was carried out for the 100 patients considered in the case group. Among them, 6 patients were used as representatives to show the trend in these biomarkers during the course of hospital stay. These 5 severe cases consisted of 2 adult males, 2 adult females, and 1 adolescent girl. This selection is to demonstrate the representation of COVID-19 infection in adult males and females and pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome associated with COVID-19 in the younger age group.

Our main objective was to develop a core outcome set (COS) for use in trials aimed at improving AMS in care homes. METHODS: A refined inventory of outcomes for AMS interventions in care homes, compiled from a previous study, was rated in a three-round international Delphi survey with 82 participants, using a nine-point Likert scale (from 1, unimportant, to 9, critical). This was followed by an online consensus exercise with 12 participants from Northern Ireland to finalise the COS content. Subsequently, a suitable outcome measurement instrument (OMI) was selected for each outcome in the COS by: identifying existing OMIs through a literature search and experts' suggestions, assessing the quality of OMIs, and selecting one OMI for each core outcome via a two-round international Delphi survey with 59 participants. RESULTS: Of 14 outcomes initially presented, consensus was reached for inclusion of five outcomes in the COS after the three-round Delphi survey and the online consensus exercise, comprising the total number of antimicrobial courses prescribed, appropriateness of antimicrobial prescribing, days of therapy per 1000 resident-days, rate of antimicrobial resistance, and mortality related to infection. Of 17 potential OMIs identified, three were selected for the two-round Delphi exercise after the quality assessment. Consensus was reached for selection of two OMIs for the COS.

321977,Management challenges for chronic dysimmune neuropathies during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"In recent times, computational methods played an important role in the down selection of chemical compounds, which could be a potential drug candidate with a high affinity to target proteins. However, the screening methodologies, including docking, often fails to identify the most effective compound, which could be a ligand for the target protein. To solve that, here we have integrated meta-dynamics, an enhanced sampling molecular simulation method, with all-atom molecular dynamics to determine a specific compound that could target the main protease of novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2). This combined computational approach uses the enhanced sampling to explore the free energy surface associated with the protein's binding site (including the ligand) in an explicit solvent. We have implemented this method to find new chemical entities that exhibit high specificity of binding to the 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro) present in the SARS-CoV-2 and segregated to the most strongly bound ligands based on free energy and scoring functions (defined and implemented) from a set of 17 ligands which were prescreened for synthesizability and druggability. Additionally, we have compared these 17 ligands' affinities against controls, N3 and 13b &#945;-ketoamide inhibitors, for which experimental crystal structures are available. Based on our results and analysis from the combined molecular simulation approach, we could identify the best compound which could be further taken as a potential candidate for experimental validation.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

The first case of COVID-19 was reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. Since then, there have been more than 21 million incidences and 761 thousand casualties worldwide as of 16 August 2020. One of the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 is that its symptoms and fatality rates vary with the ages of the infected individuals. This study aims at assessing the impact of social distancing on the reduction of COVID-19 infected cases by constructing a mathematical model and using epidemiological data of incidences in Korea. We developed an age-structured mathematical model for describing the age-dependent dynamics of the spread of COVID-19 in Korea. We estimated the model parameters and computed the reproduction number using the actual epidemiological data reported from 1 February to 15 June 2020. We then divided the data into seven distinct periods depending on the intensity of social distancing implemented by the Korean government. By using a contact matrix to describe the contact patterns between ages, we investigated the potential effect of social distancing under various scenarios. We discovered that when the intensity of social distancing is reduced, the number of COVID-19 cases increases; the number of incidences among the age groups of people 60 and above increases significantly more than that of the age groups below the age of 60. This significant increase among the elderly groups poses a severe threat to public health because the incidence of severe cases and fatality rates of the elderly group are much higher than those of the younger groups. Therefore, it is necessary to maintain strict social distancing rules to reduce infected cases.","Choi, Yongin; Kim, James Slghee; Choi, Heejin; Lee, Hyojung; Lee, Chang Hyeong",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,597

Then, the infection rates are optimized by genetic algorithm (GA) and a modified susceptible-infected-quarantined-recovered (SIQR) epidemic spreading model is proposed. In addition, the long short-term memory (LSTM) is imbedded into the SIQR model to design the hybrid intelligent model to further optimize other parameters of the system model, which can obtain the optimal predictive model and control measures.

From the beginning of infection, patients will progress through different symptom stages, such as fever, dyspnea or even death. Identifying disease progression and predicting patient outcome at an early stage helps target treatment and resource allocation. However, there is no clear COVID-19 stage definition, and few studies have addressed characterizing COVID-19 progression, making the need for this study evident. METHODS: We proposed a temporal deep learning method, based on a time-aware long short-term memory (T-LSTM) neural network and used an online open dataset, including blood samples of 485 patients from Wuhan, China, to train the model. Our method can grasp the dynamic relations in irregularly sampled time series, which is ignored by existing works. Specifically, our method predicted the outcome of COVID-19 patients by considering both the biomarkers and the irregular time intervals. Then, we used the patient representations, extracted from T-LSTM units, to subtype the patient stages and describe the disease progression of COVID-19. RESULTS: Using our method, the accuracy of the outcome of prediction results was more than 90% at 12 days and 98, 95 and 93% at 3, 6, and 9 days, respectively. Most importantly, we found 4 stages of COVID-19 progression with different patient statuses and mortality risks. We ranked 40 biomarkers related to disease and gave the reference values of them for each stage. Top 5 is Lymph, LDH, hs-CRP, Indirect Bilirubin, Creatinine. Besides, we have found 3 complications - myocardial injury, liver function injury and renal function injury. Predicting which of the 4 stages the patient is currently in can help doctors better assess and cure the patient. CONCLUSIONS: To combat the COVID-19 epidemic, this paper aims to help clinicians better assess and treat infected patients, provide relevant researchers with potential disease progression patterns, and enable more effective use of medical resources. Our method predicted patient outcomes with high accuracy and identified a four-stage disease progression. We hope that the obtained results and patterns will aid in fighting the disease.","Sun, Chenxi; Hong, Shenda; Song, Moxian; Li, Hongyan; Wang, Zhenjie",BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,,597
323843,"Endoscopy in inflammatory bowel diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic and post-pandemic period (vol 5, pg 598, 2020)",2021,"Antibody therapies such as convalescent plasma and monoclonal antibodies have emerged as major potential therapeutics for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Immunoglobulins differ from conventional antimicrobial agents in that they mediate direct and indirect antimicrobial effects that work in concert with other components of the immune system. The field of infectious diseases pioneered antibody therapies in the first half of the 20th century but largely abandoned them with the arrival of conventional antimicrobial therapy. Consequently, much of the knowledge gained from the historical development and use of immunoglobulins such as serum and convalescent antibody therapies was forgotten; principles and practice governing their use were not taught to new generations of medical practitioners, and further development of this modality stalled. This became apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic in the spring of 2020 when convalescent plasma was initially deployed as salvage therapy in patients with severe disease. In retrospect, this was a stage of disease when it was less likely to be effective. Lessons of the past tell us that antibody therapy is most likely to be effective when used early in respiratory diseases. This article puts forth three principles of antibody therapy, namely, specificity, temporal, and quantitative principles, connoting that antibody efficacy requires the administration of specific antibody, given early in course of disease in sufficient amount. These principles are traced to the history of serum therapy for infectious diseases. The application of the specificity, temporal, and quantitative principles to COVID-19 is discussed in the context of current use of antibody therapy against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).","Casadevall, Arturo; Pirofski, Liise-Anne; Joyner, Michael J",mBio (Online),,597

METHODS: The COVID-19 suspects are subjected to nasopharyngeal (NP) and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs for testing. Two types of swabs (Nylon and Dacron) are used for sample collection. Prospectively each suspect's response is collected and assessed for self-reported comfort level. The provider's experience with each suspect and virological outcomes recorded separately. The sample adequacy was compared based on swab types and demographic characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 1008 COVID-19 suspects were considered for comparison of various outcomes. Dacron and flocked Nylon swab sticks are used for taking 530 and 478 samples, respectively. Suspects who underwent the procedure using Nylon swabs were six times more likely to have pain/discomfort compared to when Dacron swab was used (Adj RR (95% CI: 6.76 (3.53 to 13, p=0.0001))). The providers perceived six times more resistance with the Nylon swabs compared to Dacron Swabs (Adj RR (95% CI: 5.96 (3.88 to 9.14, p=0.0001))). The pediatric population had a higher rate of blood staining in Dacron swab [Dacron 66 (80.5%); Nylon 51 (54.8%) p=0.0001]. The sample adequacy rate and laboratory positivity rate were not significantly different from each other.

324425,India's lockdown exit: are we prepared to lock horns with COVID-19 and dengue in the rainy season?,2020,"Approximately 375,000 deaths during 2020 were attributed to COVID-19 on death certificates reported to CDC (1). Concerns have been raised that some deaths are being improperly attributed to COVID-19 (2). Analysis of International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnoses on official death certificates might provide an expedient and efficient method to demonstrate whether reported COVID-19 deaths are being overestimated. CDC assessed documentation of diagnoses co-occurring with an ICD-10 code for COVID-19 (U07.1) on U.S. death certificates from 2020 that had been reported to CDC as of February 22, 2021. Among 378,048 death certificates listing U07.1, a total of 357,133 (94.5%) had at least one other ICD-10 code; 20,915 (5.5%) had only U07.1. Overall, 97.3% of 357,133 death certificates with at least one other diagnosis (91.9% of all 378,048 death certificates) were noted to have a co-occurring diagnosis that was a plausible chain-of-event condition (e.g., pneumonia or respiratory failure), a significant contributing condition (e.g., hypertension or diabetes), or both. Overall, 70%-80% of death certificates had both a chain-of-event condition and a significant contributing condition or a chain-of-event condition only; this was noted for adults aged 18-84 years, both males and females, persons of all races and ethnicities, those who died in inpatient and outpatient or emergency department settings, and those whose manner of death was listed as natural. These findings support the accuracy of COVID-19 mortality surveillance in the United States using official death certificates. High-quality documentation of co-occurring diagnoses on the death certificate is essential for a comprehensive and authoritative public record. Continued messaging and training (3) for professionals who complete death certificates remains important as the pandemic progresses. Accurate mortality surveillance is critical for understanding the impact of variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and of COVID-19 vaccination and for guiding public health action.","Gundlapalli, Adi V; Lavery, Amy M; Boehmer, Tegan K; Beach, Michael J; Walke, Henry T; Sutton, Paul D; Anderson, Robert N",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,597

324989,Do we really need guidelines for HRA during the COVID-19 pandemic?,2020,"BACKGROUND: E-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI) is a complex inflammatory syndrome predominantly seen in adolescents and young adults. The clinical and laboratory profile can easily mimic infectious and noninfectious conditions. The exclusion of these conditions is essential to establish the diagnosis. Recently, the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic introduced the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). MIS-C knowledge is evolving. The current criteria to establish the diagnosis are not specific and have overlapping features with EVALI, making the accurate diagnosis a clinical challenge during continued COVID-19 transmission within the community. CASE REPORT: Three young adults evaluated at our emergency department for prolonged fever and gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms were initially assessed for possible MIS-C due to epidemiologic links to COVID-19 and were eventually diagnosed with EVALI. The clinical, laboratory, and radiologic characteristics of both entities are explored, as well as the appropriate medical management. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Physician awareness of overlapping and differentiating EVALI and MIS-C features is essential to direct appropriate diagnostic evaluation and medical management of adolescents and young adults presenting with systemic inflammatory response during the unfolding pandemic of COVID-19.","Hassoun, Ameer; Brady, KeriAnne; Arefi, Rojin; Trifonova, Irina; Tsirilakis, Kalliope",J. emerg. med,,597

AIM: To summarize the findings of a multinational observational cohort of patients with SARS-CoV-2 and cerebrovascular disease. METHODS: Retrospective observational cohort of consecutive adults evaluated in the emergency department and/or admitted with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) across 31 hospitals in four countries (1 February 2020-16 June 2020). The primary outcome was the incidence rate of cerebrovascular events, inclusive of acute ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhages (ICH), and cortical vein and/or sinus thrombosis (CVST). RESULTS: Of the 14,483 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2, 172 were diagnosed with an acute cerebrovascular event (1.13% of cohort; 1130/100,000 patients, 95%CI 970-1320/100,000), 68/171 (40.5%) were female and 96/172 (55.8%) were between the ages 60 and 79 years. Of these, 156 had acute ischemic stroke (1.08%; 1080/100,000 95%CI 920-1260/100,000), 28 ICH (0.19%; 190/100,000 95%CI 130-280/100,000), and 3 with CVST (0.02%; 20/100,000, 95%CI 4-60/100,000). The in-hospital mortality rate for SARS-CoV-2-associated stroke was 38.1% and for ICH 58.3%. After adjusting for clustering by site and age, baseline stroke severity, and all predictors of in-hospital mortality found in univariate regression (p < 0.1: male sex, tobacco use, arrival by emergency medical services, lower platelet and lymphocyte counts, and intracranial occlusion), cryptogenic stroke mechanism (aOR 5.01, 95%CI 1.63-15.44, p < 0.01), older age (aOR 1.78, 95%CI 1.07-2.94, p = 0.03), and lower lymphocyte count on admission (aOR 0.58, 95%CI 0.34-0.98, p = 0.04) were the only independent predictors of mortality among patients with stroke and COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is associated with a small but significant risk of clinically relevant cerebrovascular events, particularly ischemic stroke. The mortality rate is high for COVID-19-associated cerebrovascular complications; therefore, aggressive monitoring and early intervention should be pursued to mitigate poor outcomes.","Siegler, James E; Cardona, Pere; Arenillas, Juan F; Talavera, Blanca; Guillen, Ana N; Chavarría-Miranda, Alba; de Lera, Mercedes; Khandelwal, Priyank; Bach, Ivo; Patel, Pratit; Singla, Amit; Requena, Manuel; Ribo, Marc; Jillella, Dinesh V; Rangaraju, Srikant; Nogueira, Raul G; Haussen, Diogo C; Vazquez, Alejandro R; Urra, Xabier; Chamorro, Ángel; Román, Luis S; Thon, Jesse M; Then, Ryna; Sanborn, Emma; de la Ossa, Natalia P; Millàn, Mònica; Ruiz, Isaac N; Mansour, Ossama Y; Megahed, Mohammed; Tiu, Cristina; Terecoasa, Elena O; Radu, Razvan A; Nguyen, Thanh N; Curiale, Gioacchino; Kaliaev, Artem; Czap, Alexandra L; Sebaugh, Jacob; Zha, Alicia M; Liebeskind, David S; Ortega-Gutierrez, Santiago; Farooqui, Mudassir; Hassan, Ameer E; Preston, Laurie; Patterson, Mary S; Bushnaq, Saif; Zaidat, Osama; Jovin, Tudor G",Int J Stroke,,597

Objectives: This study aimed to describe the prevalence of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) cases among health professionals and the frequencies of risk factors and psychosocial risk. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study targeted at health professionals working in Portugal during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Data were obtained through a self-administered questionnaire available online at the websites of medical and nursing boards, among other sources. We performed a univariate analysis, calculating absolute and relative frequencies, and a bivariate analysis with a Pearson's chi-squared test. Results: We studied 4,212 health professionals, of which 36.7% (n = 1,514) worked in areas dedicated to the treatment of sick or suspected COVID-19 patients. Of these, 2.11% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Among all participants, 76.7% and 79.1% presented moderate to severe levels of fatigue and anxiety, respectively. Fatigue levels were significantly higher in professionals working in areas dedicated to the treatment of patients with COVID-19 (80.5% p = 0.01), but this difference was not observed regarding anxiety (79.5% p = 0.681). Conclusions: The percentage of health professionals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 was 2.11%. The reported high levels of fatigue and anxiety should determine a better protection of the health and safety of those who provide health care in the current pandemic. © 2021 Associacao Nacional de Medicina do Trabalho.

The present study aims to report the regional variations of North American adult cardiac surgical case volume and case mix through the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A survey was sent to recruit participating adult cardiac surgery centers in North America. Data in regard to changes in institutional and regional cardiac surgical case volume and mix were analyzed. RESULTS: Our study comprises 67 adult cardiac surgery institutions with diverse geographic distribution across North America, representing annualized case volumes of 60,452 in 2019. Nonurgent surgery was stopped during the month of March 2020 in the majority of centers (96%), resulting in a decline to 45% of baseline with significant regional variation. Hospitals with a high burden of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 demonstrated similar trends of decline in total volume as centers in low burden areas. As a proportion of total surgical volume, there was a relative increase of coronary artery bypass grafting surgery (high +7.2% vs low +4.2%, P = .550), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (high +2.5% vs low 0.4%, P = .328), and heart transplantation (high +2.7% vs low 0.4%, P = .090), and decline in valvular cases (high -7.6% vs low -2.6%, P = .195).

The Quebec Lung Cancer Network, which oversees thoracic oncology services in the province of Quebec under the direction of the Ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux, convened to develop recommendations to deal with the potential disruption of services in thoracic oncology in the province of Quebec. The summary provided here has been adapted from the original document posted on the Programme québécois du cancer Web site at: https://www.msss.gouv.qc.ca/professionnels/documents/coronavirus-2019-ncov/PJ1_Recommandations_oncologie-thoracique-200415.pdf. Methods: Plans to optimize the health care system and potentially to prioritize services were discussed with respect to various levels of activity. For each level-of-activity scenario, suggestions were made for the services and treatments to prioritize and for those that might have to be postponed, as well as for potential alternatives to care. Results: The principal recommendation is that the cancer centre executive committee and the multidisciplinary tumour board always try to find a solution to maintain standard-of-care therapy for all patients with thoracic tumours, using novel approaches to treatment and the adoption of a network approach to care, as needed. Conclusions: The effect of the covid-19 pandemic on the health care system remains unpredictable and requires that cancer teams unite and offer the most efficient and innovative therapies to all patients under the various conditions that might be forced upon them.","Blais, N; Bouchard, M; Chinas, M; Lizotte, H; Morneau, M; Spicer, J; Martel, S",Curr Oncol,,597

A major key to tackling this virus is to disrupt its RNA replication process as previously reported for Remdesivir (Rem-P3). In this study, we theorize, using computational simulations, novel mechanisms that may underlie the binding of Rem-P3 to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp-NSPs complex; a multimeric assembly that drives viral RNA replication in human hosts. Findings revealed that while ATP-binding stabilized the replicative tripartite, Rem-P3 disintegrated the RdRp-NSP complex, starting with the detachment of the NSP7-NSP8 heterodimer followed by minimal displacement of the second NSP8 subunit (NSP8II). More so, Rem-P3 interacted with a relatively higher affinity (&#916;Gbind) while inducing high perturbations across the RdRp-NSP domains. D452, T556, V557, S682, and D760 were identified for their crucial roles in stacking the cyano-adenosine and 3,4-dihydroxyoxolan rings of Rem-P3 while its flexible P3 tail extended towards the palm domain blocking D618 and K798; a residue-pair identified for essential roles in RNA replication. However, ATP folded away from D618 indicative of a more coordinated binding favorable for nucleotide polymerization. We believe findings from this study will significantly contribute to the structure-based design of novel disruptors of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA replicative machinery.","Olotu, Fisayo A; Omolabi, Kehinde F; Soliman, Mahmoud E S",Cell Biochem Biophys,,597

329580,Noncutaneous considerations of COVID-19 for dermatology practices,2020,"Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into value-added chemical fuels is an appealing approach to address energy crisis and global warming. CsPbBr3 quantum dots (QDs) are good candidates for CO2 reduction because of their excellent photoelectric properties, including high molar extinction coefficient, low exciton binding energy, and defect tolerance. However, the pristine CsPbBr3 QDs generally have low photocatalytic performance mainly due to dominant charge recombination and lack of efficient catalytic sites for CO2 adsorption/activation. Herein, we report a new photocatalytic system, in which CsPbBr3 QDs are coupled with covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) for visible-light-driven CO2 reduction. In this hybrid photocatalytic system, the robust triazine rings and periodical pore structures of CTFs promote the charge separation in CsPbBr3 and endow them with strong CO2 adsorption/activation capacity. The resulting photocatalytic system exhibits excellent photocatalytic activity towards CO2 reduction. This work presents a new photocatalytic system based on CTFs and perovskite QDs for visible-light-driven CO2 reduction, which highlights the potential of perovskite-based photocatalysts for solar fuel applications.","Wang, Qi; Wang, Jin; Wang, Ji-Chong; Hu, Xin; Bai, Yu; Zhong, Xinhua; Li, Zhengquan","ChemSusChem (Weinh., Internet)",,597
329656,COVID-19 in the Americas: Strategies that Mark the Difference,2020,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) expression may increase due to upregulation in patients using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). Because renin-angiotensin system blockers increase levels of ACE2, a protein that facilitates coronavirus entry into cells, there is concern that these drugs could increase the risk of developing a severe and fatal form of COVID-19. The impact of discontinuing ACEI and ARBs in patients with COVID-19 remains uncertain. DESIGN: BRACE CORONA is a pragmatic, multicenter, randomized, phase IV, clinical trial that aims to enroll around 500 participants at 34 sites in Brazil. Participants will be identified from an ongoing national registry of suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19. Eligible patients using renin-angiotensin system blockers (ACEI/ARBs) with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 will be randomized to a strategy of continued ACEI/ARB treatment versus temporary discontinuation for 30 days. The primary outcome is the median days alive and out of the hospital at 30 days. Secondary outcomes include progression of COVID-19 disease, all-cause mortality, death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischemic attack, new or worsening heart failure, myocarditis, pericarditis, arrhythmias, thromboembolic events, hypertensive crisis, respiratory failure, hemodynamic decompensation, sepsis, renal failure, and troponin, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), N-terminal-proBNP, and D-dimer levels.

329836,PMU29 Burden of COVID-19 Consequences: an Example of Post-viral Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,2021,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a group of single stranded RNA viruses, of which some of them such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are associated with deadly worldwide human diseases. Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), a condition caused by SARS-CoV-2, results in acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with high mortality in the elderly and in people with underlying comorbidities. Results from several studies suggest that CoVs localize in mitochondria and interact with mitochondrial protein translocation machinery to target their encoded products to mitochondria. Coronaviruses encode a number of proteins; this process is essential for viral replication through inhibiting degradation of viral proteins and host misfolded proteins including those in mitochondria. These viruses seem to maintain their replication by altering mitochondrial dynamics and targeting mitochondrial-associated antiviral signaling (MAVS), allowing them to evade host innate immunity. Coronaviruses infections such as COVID-19 are more severe in aging patients. Since endogenous melatonin levels are often dramatically reduced in the aged and because it is a potent anti-inflammatory agent, melatonin has been proposed to be useful in CoVs infections by altering proteasomal and mitochondrial activities. Melatonin inhibits mitochondrial fission due to its antioxidant and inhibitory effects on cytosolic calcium overload.

329917,Exploring the rationale for thermotherapy in COVID-19,2021,"Currently, the expansion of the novel human respiratory coronavirus (known as SARS-CoV-2 [severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2], COVID-2019 [coronavirus disease 2019], or 2019-nCoV [2019 novel coronavirus]) has stressed the need for therapeutic alternatives to alleviate and stop this new epidemic. The previous epidemics of infections by high-morbidity human coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV in 2003 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, prompted the characterization of compounds that could be potentially active against the currently emerging novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. The most promising compound is remdesivir (GS-5734), a nucleotide analog prodrug currently in clinical trials for treating Ebola virus infections. Remdesivir inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in tissue cultures, and it displayed efficacy in nonhuman animal models. In addition, a combination of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon beta (LPV/RTV-IFN-ß) was shown to be effective in patients infected with SARS-CoV. LPV/RTV-IFN-ß also improved clinical parameters in marmosets and mice infected with MERS-CoV. Remarkably, the therapeutic efficacy of remdesivir appeared to be superior to that of LPV/RTV-IFN-ß against MERS-CoV in a transgenic humanized mouse model. The relatively high mortality rates associated with these three novel human coronavirus infections, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, have suggested that proinflammatory responses might play a role in the pathogenesis. It remains unknown whether the generated inflammatory state should be targeted. Therapeutics that target the coronavirus alone might not be able to reverse highly pathogenic infections. This minireview aims to provide a summary of therapeutic compounds that have shown potential in fighting SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Martinez, Miguel Angel",,,597
329918,Exploring the rationale for thermotherapy in COVID-19,2021,"In Spain, Home Care as a fundamental tool of Primary Health Care, has had uneven development both before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, although it initially played a relevant role in the control and monitoring of infected people and their families. However, at no time it was used the desirable community perspective and community participation throughout the process as it has been successfully done in other settings. Subsequently, with the closure of health centers, it ceased to be provided in some autonomous communities, when all the attention was transferred to the hospital setting. This exacerbated hospital-centrism, to the detriment of PHC and Home Care, is showing a high contagion in healthcare professionals. The circulation of professionals in the hospitals, where the main focus of infection is concentrated, and from these to their homes is a clear risk factor. In addition, we must not forget that Home Care is of special importance for the care of people with terminal illnesses or very advanced chronic diseases (dementia, COPD ...), although always taking into account recommendations tending to extreme precautions for infection for professionals, family and caregivers. This can be adapted to the pandemic situation by using tools that digital health offers (telephone care, video calls ...). Finally, it would be very interesting that, once the crisis was over, research was carried out that allowed the incorporation of people who have been treated by the health service during the pandemic, through the technique called public participation in research projects.","Ramón Martínez Riera, José; Gras-Nieto, Elvira",Enferm. clin.

330875,Reduced fixation stability induced by peripheral viewing does not contribute to crowding,2020,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide and encompasses diverse diseases of the vasculature, myocardium, cardiac electrical circuit, and cardiac development. Forkhead box protein P1 (Foxp1) is a large multi-domain transcriptional regulator belonging to the Fox family with winged helix DNA-binding protein, which plays critical roles in cardiovascular homeostasis and disorders. The broad distribution of Foxp1 and alternative splicing isoforms implicate its distinct functions in diverse cardiac and vascular cells and tissue types. Foxp1 is essential for diverse biological processes and has been shown to regulate cellular proliferation, apoptosis, oxidative stress, fibrosis, angiogenesis, cardiovascular remodeling, and dysfunction. Notably, both loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches have defined critical roles of Foxp1 in CVD. Genetic deletion of Foxp1 results in pathological cardiac remodeling, exacerbation of atherosclerotic lesion formation, prolonged occlusive thrombus formation, severe cardiac defects, and embryo death. In contrast, activation of Foxp1 performs a wide range of physiological effects, including cell growth, hypertrophy, differentiation, angiogenesis, and cardiac development. More importantly, Foxp1 exerts anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerotic effects in controlling coronary thrombus formation and myocardial infarction (MI). Thus, targeting for Foxp1 signaling has emerged as a pre-warning biomarker and a novel therapeutic approach against progression of CVD, and an increased understanding of cardiovascular actions of the Foxp1 signaling will help to develop effective interventions. In this review, we focus on the diverse actions and underlying mechanisms of Foxp1 highlighting its roles in CVD, including heart failure, MI, atherosclerosis, congenital heart defects, and atrial fibrillation.","Liu, Xin-Ming; Du, Sheng-Li; Miao, Ran; Wang, Le-Feng; Zhong, Jiu-Chang",Heart fail. rev,,597

Subject to country-specific variability, it is projected that with current mitigation measures in place, the peak incidence of active COVID-19 infections may be delayed by over 6 months. Although this aims to prevent the overburdening of healthcare systems, prolonged deferral of elective endoscopy will become unsustainable. Herein, we propose that by incorporating readily available point-of-care tests and conducting accurate clinical risk assessments, a safe and timely return to elective endoscopy is feasible. Our algorithm not only focuses on the safety of patients and healthcare workers, but also assists in rationalizing the use of invaluable resources such as personal protective equipment.","Gupta, Sunil; Shahidi, Neal; Gilroy, Nicole; Rex, Douglas K; Burgess, Nicholas G; Bourke, Michael J",Gastrointest Endosc,,597

One such critical approach is targeting proteins such as helicases that regulate most of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA metabolism. The purpose of the current study was to predict a library of phytochemicals derived from diverse plant families with high binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 helicase (Nsp13) enzyme. High throughput virtual screening of the Medicinal Plant Database for Drug Design (MPD3) database was performed on SARS-CoV-2 helicase using AutoDock Vina. Nilotinib, with a docking value of -9.6 kcal/mol, was chosen as a reference molecule. A compound (PubChem CID: 110143421, ZINC database ID: ZINC257223845, eMolecules: 43290531) was screened as the best binder (binding energy of -10.2 kcal/mol on average) to the enzyme by using repeated docking runs in the screening process. On inspection, the compound was disclosed to show different binding sites of the triangular pockets collectively formed by Rec1A, Rec2A, and 1B domains and a stalk domain at the base. The molecule is often bound to the ATP binding site (referred to as binding site 2) of the helicase enzyme. The compound was further discovered to fulfill drug-likeness and lead-likeness criteria, have good physicochemical and pharmacokinetics properties, and to be non-toxic. Molecular dynamic simulation analysis of the control/lead compound complexes demonstrated the formation of stable complexes with good intermolecular binding affinity. Lastly, affirmation of the docking simulation studies was accomplished by estimating the binding free energy by MMPB/GBSA technique. Taken together, these findings present further in silco investigation of plant-derived lead compounds to effectively address COVID-19.","Ahmad, Sajjad; Waheed, Yasir; Ismail, Saba; Bhatti, Saadia; Abbasi, Sumra Wajid; Muhammad, Khalid",Molecules (Basel),,597
332048,Welche Schutzmaske schützt vor COVID-19? Was ist evidenzbasiert?,2020,"As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, there is an imminent need for rapid diagnostic tools and effective antivirals targeting SARS-CoV-2. We have developed a novel bioluminescence-based biosensor to probe a key host-virus interaction during viral entry: the binding of SARS-CoV-2 viral spike (S) protein to its receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Derived from Nanoluciferase binary technology (NanoBiT), the biosensor is composed of Nanoluciferase split into two complementary subunits, Large BiT and Small BiT, fused to the Spike S1 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and ACE2 ectodomain, respectively. The ACE2-S1 interaction results in reassembly of functional Nanoluciferase, which catalyzes a bioluminescent reaction that can be assayed in a highly sensitive and specific manner. We demonstrate the biosensor's large dynamic range, enhanced thermostability and pH tolerance. In addition, we show the biosensor's versatility towards the high-throughput screening of drugs which disrupt the ACE2-S1 interaction, as well as its ability to act as a surrogate virus neutralization assay. Results obtained with our biosensor correlate well with those obtained with a Spike-pseudotyped lentivirus assay. This rapid in vitro tool does not require infectious virus and should enable the timely development of antiviral modalities targeting SARS-CoV-2 entry.","Azad, Taha; Singaravelu, Ragunath; Brown, Emily E F; Taha, Zaid; Rezaei, Reza; Arulanandam, Rozanne; Boulton, Stephen; Diallo, Jean-Simon; Ilkow, Carolina S; Bell, John C",Biosens Bioelectron,,597

The diagnosis was made in patients with confirmed Covid-19 who presented with new-onset cognitive disturbances, central focal neurological signs or seizures. All patients underwent cognitive screening, brain MRI, lumbar puncture, and brain FDG-PET/CT. RESULTS: The four patients were 60 years of age or older, and presented with various degrees of cognitive impairment, with predominant frontal lobe impairment. Two patients presented with cerebellar syndrome, one had myoclonus, one had psychiatric manifestations, and one patient had status epilepticus. The delay between first Covid-19 symptoms and onset of neurological symptoms was between 0 and 12 days. None of the patients had MRI features of encephalitis nor significant CSF abnormalities. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in the CSF was negative for all patients.

CASE PRESENTATION: This report describes the response of a multisite integrated system to the COVID-19 pandemic through activation of the Hospital Incident Command System. DISCUSSION: A robust emergency response plan with multidisciplinary involvement can help to ensure clear lines of accountability and expedite decision-making. Consistent physician input across affected specialties allows for a robust understanding of impacted areas, peer-to-peer communication, and a sense of ownership across the medical staff. The necessity of effective communication with staff and patients during times of crisis cannot be understated. The potential for information overload in a pandemic is significant but can be overcome through consistent and transparent communication from leadership. CONCLUSION: Health systems should have a well-organized emergency response system prepared to launch in small-scale or large-scale situations. The threshold to implement the response system and accountability to make that decision must be a clearly defined organizational policy.","Love, E. A.; Degen, S. C.; Craig, J. E.; Helmers, R.

Contexts are defined as sets of presuppositions that shape a person’s experiences. We examine how two very common contexts, mind and self, can inform therapists’ understanding of how their clients are responding to the coronavirus pandemic. The mind consists of a person’s defensive and protective postures in the face of perceived threat, whereas the self takes a broader perspective and emphasizes human connections and interrelatedness. Therapists can use several mind/self contrasts—blame versus responsibility, insufficiency versus sufficiency, being at effect versus being at cause, and avoidance versus mastery—to assist people who are struggling in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.","Raskin, Jonathan D.; Efran, Jay S.",J.

This disease has a multifactorial origin and it is associated with multiple comorbidities including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, osteoarthritis, metabolic syndrome, cancer, and dyslipidemia. With regard to dyslipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia is a well-known activator of the NLRP3 inflammasome, triggering adipokines and cytokines secretion which in addition induce a systemic inflammatory state that provides an adequate scenario for infections, particularly those mediated by viruses such as HIV, H1N1 influenza, and SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV-2 infection causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and it is responsible for the pandemic that we are currently living. COVID-19 causes an aggressive immune response known as cytokine release syndrome or cytokine storm that causes multiorgan failure and in most cases leads to death. In the present work, we aimed to review the molecular mechanisms by which obesity-associated systemic inflammation could cause a more severe clinical presentation of COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 infection could potentiate or accelerate the pre-existing systemic inflammatory state of individuals with obesity, via the NLRP3 inflammasome activation and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from cells trough Gasdermin-pores commonly found in cell death by pyroptosis.","López-Reyes, Alberto; Martinez-Armenta, Carlos; Espinosa-Velázquez, Rocio; Vázquez-Cárdenas, Paola; Cruz-Ramos, Marlid; Palacios-Gonzalez, Berenice; Gomez-Quiroz, Luis Enrique; Martínez-Nava, Gabriela Angélica",Front Immunol,,597

Based on this, the Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche dell'Adulto (GIMEMA) has recently developed a digital health tool dedicated to patients with hematologic malignancies: the GIMEMA-ALLIANCE platform. OBJECTIVE: The main objectives of this web-based platform are to generate relevant data to better understand quality of life, symptoms, and medication adherence during the COVID-19 pandemic and postpandemic era; to develop a prospective real-life registry on outcomes of patients with hematologic cancer, with or without a diagnosis of COVID-19; and to facilitate patient-centered care in routine practice. METHODS: The platform consists of physician- and patient-secure portals and enables electronic patient-reported outcome (ePRO) assessments with real-time graphical presentation to physicians of individual patient symptoms and quality-of-life outcomes. Automated alerts are sent to treating hematologists based on the following predetermined criteria: presence of clinically important problems and symptoms, problems with adherence to therapy, and risk of COVID-19 diagnosis. The platform also allows physicians to set up video consultations. Clinical information regarding disease and treatment as well as clinical and survival outcomes are also prospectively collected. RESULTS: Recruitment of participants started in December 2020. As of April 2021, a total of 116 patients have been enrolled in this study. Use of this platform may help to improve patient-physician communication and help hematologists in the early recognition of clinically important problems and symptoms of their patients. More than 20 community and university-based hospitals have currently agreed to participate. In addition to patient-reported outcome data, the prospective collection of disease- and treatment-related information, as well as data on possible COVID-19 diagnosis and COVID-19 vaccination, will allow the development of a large database to also identify subgroups of patients at risk of poor outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Data generated via this platform will help to answer clinically relevant questions for patients with hematologic malignancies during the COVID-19 pandemic and postpandemic era. The use of the GIMEMA-ALLIANCE platform in routine practice may also contribute to enhancing patient-centered care.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cs-131 decays by 100% electron capture producing K- (9%) and L- (80%) Auger electrons with mean energies of 26 keV and 3.5 keV, respectively, plus &#8776; 9.4 very low energy electrons (<0.5 keV) per decay. Cs-131 accumulates in the cells through the Na+/K+-ATPase. By this uptake mechanism and the alkali chemistry of Cs+, we argue for its intracellular homogeneous distribution. Cs-131 was added to the cell culture medium of HeLa and V79 Cells. The bio-kinetics of Cs-131 (uptake, release, intracellular distribution) was examined by measuring its intracellular activity concentration over time. Taking advantage of the 100% confluent cellular monolayer, we developed a new and robust dosimetry that is entrusted to a quantity called S C-value. RESULTS: The S C-values evaluated in the cell nucleus are almost independent of the nuclear size and geometry. We obtained dose-rate controlled RBE-values for intracellular Cs-131 decay. Using the Î³H2AX assay, the RBE was 1 for HeLa cells. Using the clonogenic cell survival, it was 3.9 for HeLa cells and 3.2 for V79 cells. CONCLUSION: This experimental setup and dosimetry provides reliable RBE-values for Auger emitters in various cell lines.","Fredericia, Pil M; Siragusa, Mattia; Köster, Ulli; Severin, Gregory; Groesser, Torsten; Jensen, Mikael",Int J Radiat Biol,,597

Their major sources of information about COVID-19, the relationships between the sources and demographic factors, and the relationships between the sources and the self-confidence in coping with COVID-19 were surveyed. RESULTS: Most Taiwanese people relied on the internet for COVID-19 information. Many respondents also used a variety of sources of information on COVID-19; such variety was associated with sex, age, and the level of worry toward COVID-19, as well as if one was a health care worker. For health care workers, the use of formal lessons as an information source was significantly associated with better self-confidence in coping with COVID-19. The significant association between receiving information from more sources and greater self-confidence was found only in health care workers but not in non-health-care workers. CONCLUSIONS: Medical professionals should consider subgroups of the population when establishing various means to deliver information on COVID-19.","Wang, Peng-Wei; Lu, Wei-Hsin; Ko, Nai-Ying; Chen, Yi-Lung; Li, Dian-Jeng; Chang, Yu-Ping; Yen, Cheng-Fang",J Med Internet Res,,597

338711,The Management of COVID-19 in Forensic Psychiatric Institutions,2020,"Do crisis evolve linearly through sequential one-directional stages that end with their resolution? Or are crisis, a set of nonlinear events with somewhat a chaotic nature, better represented as multilayer relapse cycles, that is, a series of dynamic processes and templates that evolve at different levels of analysis and can either go forward—achievement—or go back—relapses? Moreover, should crisis always move forward to reach their resolution or should we strive to achieve social systems resilience, grounded on learning and adaptation processes, that is, moving forward and backwards, until achieving it? To argument in favor of achieving crisis resilience, we propose a theoretical model—the crisis layers and thresholds (CLT) model grounded on the following assumptions: (a) individuals' evaluations and responses should be the basis/core of crisis management and crisis communication activities;(b) different concurrent psychosocial and organizational processes occur at different levels of analysis of a crisis, from a microindividual level to a macro organization level;and (c) rather than striving for crisis resolution, we should strive for crisis resilience, preparing the social system for current and future emerging risks and crisis To implement effective evidence-based crisis management and crisis communication in line with such assumptions, we also propose the CLT-ResiliScence approach, an Information and Communication Technology-mediated crisis sensing approach This is based on monitoring “social sensors” data, particularly from social media, as an important source of information Examples of this will be provided based on research on the current COVID-19 pandemic © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","Gaspar, R.; Domingos, S.; Brito, D.; Leiras, G.; Filipe, J.; Raposo, B.; Telo de Arriaga, M.",Human Behavior and Emerging Technologies,,597

Postoperative digestive morbidities such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and esophageal stricture are common. The aim of this study was to identify the incidence of and potential risk factors for digestive morbidities after EA/TEF repair. We retrospectively reviewed all EA/TEF patients who underwent repair at a single institution between January 1999 and December 2018, excluding patients who died prior to discharge. Patient demographics, perioperative management, and postoperative GERD and esophageal stricture rates were collected. We performed univariate and multivariate analyses to examine risk factors associated with postoperative GERD and esophageal stricture. The study enrolled 58 infants (58.6% male, 17.2% with type A EA/TEF, 62.1% with associated anomalies). Postoperative GERD occurred in 67.2% of patients and was the most common digestive morbidity. Esophageal stricture occurred in 37.9% of patients after EA/TEF repair. Multivariate analysis showed that long-gap EA/TEF and postoperative GERD were independent risk factors for esophageal stricture after repair surgery.Conclusion: The incidence of postoperative GERD and esophageal stricture was 67.2% and 37.9%, respectively. The risk factors for postoperative esophageal stricture were long-gap EA/TEF and postoperative GERD. What is Known: â¢ EA/TEF is a congenital digestive tract anomaly with a high postoperative survival rate but can be complicated by many long-term morbidities. What is New: â¢ Long-gap EA/TEF and postoperative GERD are risk factors of anastomotic stricture after repair. â¢ Surgeons and pediatricians should be highly experienced in managing anastomotic tension and the GERD.","Lu, Yi-Hsuan; Yen, Ting-An; Chen, Chien-Yi; Tsao, Po-Nien; Lin, Wen-Hsi; Hsu, Wen-Ming; Chou, Hung-Chieh",Eur. j. pediatr,,597
339707,Essential training is still possible during COVID-19,2020,"Reliable transportation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) patient samples from a swabbing station to a diagnostics facility is essential for accurate results. Therefore, cooling or freezing the samples is recommended in case of longer transportation times. In this study, SARS-CoV-2 detectability by RT-PCR was assessed after prolonged unfrozen storage or repetitive freeze-thawing of SARS-CoV-2 samples. SARS-CoV-2-positive patient swabs stored in viral transport medium were exposed to different temperatures (4°C, 25°C, and 35°C) and to repetitive freeze-thawing, to assess the effect of storage conditions on RT-PCR detection. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was still reliably detected by RT-PCR after 21 days of storage in viral transport medium, even when the samples had been stored at 35°C. The maximum observed change in cycle threshold value per day was 0.046 (±0.019) at 35°C, and the maximum observed change in cycle threshold value per freeze-thaw cycle per day was 0.197 (±0.06). Compared with storage at 4°C, viral RNA levels deviated little but significantly when stored at 25°C or 35°C, or after repeated freeze-thawing. The results of this study indicate that viral RNA levels are relatively stable at higher temperatures and repetitive freeze-thawing.","Dzung, Andreas; Cheng, Phil F; Stoffel, Corinne; Tastanova, Aizhan; Turko, Patrick; Levesque, Mitchell P; Bosshard, Philipp P",J Mol Diagn,,597

340116,Characteristics of Impaired Chemosensory Function in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients,2020,"BACKGROUND: Ethical relationships are important among many participants in healthcare, including the ethical relationship between nurse and employer. One aspect of organizational behavior that can impact ethical culture and moral well-being is institutional betrayal. RESEARCH AIM: The purpose of this concept analysis is to develop a conceptual understanding of institutional betrayal in nursing by defining the concept and differentiating it from other forms of betrayal. DESIGN: This analysis uses the method developed by Walker and Avant. RESEARCH CONTEXT: Studies were reviewed using health literature databases with no date restrictions. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: Analysis was conducted using established guidelines for ethical research. FINDINGS: Although institutional betrayal is a concept applied in the literature, there was a paucity of studies exploring the concept within nursing. Examples of the concept in the literature include violation of trust between organization (i.e. employer) and nurse, such as provision of inadequate workplace protections, ineffective or hostile management, and gaslighting of those who experience negative events. Examples of institutional betrayal have become more visible during the COVID-19 pandemic. DISCUSSION: A conceptual definition of institutional betrayal is a deep violation of trust or confidence or violation of moral standards committed by an institution toward a nurse. This definition incorporates experiences and issues suggested by the literature. Outcomes are likely negative, including impacts on nurse psychological and workplace well-being. This concept likely fits within a framework of ethical workplaces and has conceptual relationships with moral distress and moral resilience. Further studies can help qualitatively explore and empirically measure this concept. CONCLUSION: In the pursuit of improving the ethical culture of healthcare workplaces, this concept can provide meaningful insight into organizational behavior and its consequences. Naming and describing the concept can promote conceptual clarity and equip researchers, nurses, and leaders to identify and mitigate the issue.","Brewer, Katherine C",Nurs Ethics,,597

340427,A Laboratory Risk Assessment during the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic,2020,"Among the various modes of communication in social media, the use of Internet memes has emerged as a powerful means to convey political, psychological, and socio-cultural opinions. Although memes are typically humorous in nature, recent days have witnessed a proliferation of harmful memes targeted to abuse various social entities. As most harmful memes are highly satirical and abstruse without appropriate contexts, off-the-shelf multimodal models may not be adequate to understand their underlying semantics. In this work, we propose two novel problem formulations: detecting harmful memes and the social entities that these harmful memes target. To this end, we present HarMeme, the first benchmark dataset, containing 3,544 memes related to COVID-19. Each meme went through a rigorous two-stage annotation process. In the first stage, we labeled a meme as very harmful, partially harmful, or harmless; in the second stage, we further annotated the type of target(s) that each harmful meme points to: individual, organization, community, or society/general public/other. The evaluation results using ten unimodal and multimodal models highlight the importance of using multimodal signals for both tasks. We further discuss the limitations of these models and we argue that more research is needed to address these problems.","Pramanick, Shraman; Dimitrov, Dimitar; Mukherjee, Rituparna; Sharma, Shivam; Akhtar, Md.

341168,COVID-19: measuring the impact on healthcare demand and capacity and exploring intervention scenarios,2020-12-31,"Aim. To determine the clinical efficacy and safety of the sorbed probiotics Bifidobacterium bifidum 1 (5×108 KОЕ) and B. bifidum 1 (5×107 KОЕ) in combination with Lactobacillus plantarum 8P-А3 in the complex therapy of pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 in adult patients without severe risk factors. Materials and methods. An open, randomized prospective study included 100 patients (45 men, 55 women), aged 18 to 60 years without risk factors for severe COVID-19 with pneumonia confirmed by computed tomography, and an area of lung lesion no more than 75% (moderate forms). SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasal and oropharyngeal swabs (RT-PCR) was detected in 72% of the participants, in the rest it was highly probable in terms of the aggregate parameters. Diagnostics of COVID-19 and its severity, the appointment of a standard examination and treatment were carried out in accordance with the Temporary Methodological Recommendations of the Ministry of Health of Russia, version 8 of 09.03.2020. This publication presents the results of using B. bifidum 1 (3 capsules twice a day for 10 days) during the peak of clinical manifestations (in a hospital). Results. In those who received sorbed B. bifidum 1, by the 10th day of treatment, the frequency of weakness was 32% lower (RR 0.55 [95% CI 0.24–0.73], OR 0.25 [0.11–0.59]);hypoosmia/dysgeusia – by 22% (RR 0.42 [0.05–0.65], OR 0.40 [0.17–0.90]) and cough – by 24% (RR 0.39 [0.07–0.60], OR 0.38 [0.17–0.84]). B. bifidum 1 reduced the average duration of weakness by 3 days [1.1–4.9], hypoosmia/dysgeusia by 3.2 days [1.3–5.1], cough by 1.9 days [0.4–3,4], dyspnea – by 1.8 days [0.7–2.7], diarrhea – by 1.7 days [0.1–3.5];reduced the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea by 20% (RR 0.77 [0.24–0.93], OR 0.18 [0.05–0.68]). Due to the deterioration of the condition and the increase in the symptoms of respiratory failure, additional treatment was required less often by 24% (p=0.005). After the end of the intervention, the frequency of virologic debridement, levels of CRP, leukocytes, lymphocytes, platelets and the degree of lung damage on computed tomography did not statistically differ in the compared groups. No side effects of B. bifidum 1 (5×108 KОЕ) have been identified. Conclusion. The use of sorbed B. bifidum 1 (5×108 KОЕ) improved the well-being of patients without risk factors with moderate viral (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia and reduced the duration of diarrheal syndrome in a short time.

The epidemic has largely been controlled in China since March 2020, but continues to inflict severe public health and socioeconomic burden in other parts of the world. One of the major reasons for China's success for the fight against the epidemic is the effectiveness of its health care system and enlightenment (awareness) programs which play a vital role in the control of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nigeria is currently witnessing a rapid increase of the epidemic likely due to its unsatisfactory health care system and inadequate awareness programs. In this paper, we propose a mathematical model to study the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in Nigeria. Our model incorporates awareness programs and different hospitalization strategies for mild and severe cases, to assess the effect of public awareness on the dynamics of COVID-19 infection. We fit the model to the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Nigeria from 29 March to 12 June 2020. We find that the epidemic could increase if awareness programs are not properly adopted. We presumed that the effect of awareness programs could be estimated. Further, our results suggest that the awareness programs and timely hospitalization of active cases are essential tools for effective control and mitigation of COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria and beyond. Finally, we perform sensitive analysis to point out the key parameters that should be considered to effectively control the epidemic.","Musa, Salihu S; Qureshi, Sania; Zhao, Shi; Yusuf, Abdullahi; Mustapha, Umar Tasiu; He, Daihai",,,597

Subsequently, there has been an increase in infections attributable to this virus throughout China and worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) has officially named the infection coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus has been classified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This appears to be a virus from Rhinolophus bats, but the intermediate host has not yet been identified. The mechanism of infection of SARS-CoV-2 is not yet known; it appears to have affinity for cells located in the lower airways, where it replicates. The interhuman transmission of coronaviruses mainly occurs through saliva droplets and direct and indirect contact via surfaces. As of March 10, 2020, the number of cases worldwide was 113,702. Along with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS), COVID-19 appears to cause a severe clinical picture in humans, ranging from mild malaise to death by sepsis/acute respiratory distress syndrome. The prognosis is worse in elderly patients with comorbidities. To date, there is no specific therapy for COVID-19. Prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection implies strategies that limit the spread of the virus. WHO and other international and national bodies have developed continuously updated strategic objectives and provisions to contain the spread of the virus and infection.","Gabutti, Giovanni; d039,; Anchera, Erica; Sandri, Federica; Savio, Marta; Stefanati, Armando",Infect Dis Ther,,597

Since there is no standard gold of surgical treatment and there is still controversy in this, it is important to evaluate the results of the different surgical techniques. The objective of this study is to evaluate postoperative results of both surgical techniques in patients with follow-up of 1 to 12 months postoperative. MATERIAL AND METHODS: It is a prospective, longitudinal, descriptive and observational study carried out in a period from January 2015 to December 2017. Postoperative open (group 1) and percutaneous needle (group 2) patients were included. All patients were reviewed and surveyed by telephone. The comparison results of both techniques were analyzed using 2 for parametric results and by the Fisher test for nonparametric results. RESULTS: It was found that patients in group 2 expressed greater satisfaction, where 21.8% (n = 12) were fully satisfied with the percutaneous procedure, unlike those in group 1 where total satisfaction was only manifested at 3.8% (n = 2).

Four-month follow-up with participation in national and international competitions. Twenty-four soccer players were included, age 27.13 years (between 20 and 36). Nine (37.5%) had asymptomatic disease and 15 (62.5%) had mild symptoms. No athletes required hospitalization. Physical, electrocardiographic, and echocardiographic examinations did not reveal heart disease. CMRs showed ventricular thicknesses and volumes consistent with high-performance athletes. In T1, T2 and fat saturation signals, no fat infiltration or signs of edema were observed. No late enhancement after gadolinium injection. They began their training between 12 and 14 days after diagnosis. Eleven (45.8%) participated between 4 and 6 international matches of Libertadores de América International Cup. The remaining 13 completed high intensity training sessions and participated in local league competitions.

Here we combine satellite observations of tropospheric NO2 from TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument and the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS)-Chem 3D chemical transport model to estimate that NO x emissions declined nationwide by ∼20% during the lockdown (23 March to 31 May 2020).

We apply a uniform 20% lockdown period emission reduction to GEOS-Chem anthropogenic emissions over the UK to determine that decline in lockdown emissions led to a national decline in PM2.5 of 1.1 μg m−3, ranging from 0.6 μg m−3 in Scotland to 2 μg m−3 in the southwest. The decline in emissions in cities (&gt;40%) is greater than the national average and causes an increase in ozone of ∼2 ppbv in London and Manchester. The change in ozone and PM2.5 concentrations due to emission reductions alone is about half the total change from 2019 to 2020.

Whereas no one husbandry animal case has been reported to date, which would have significant implications in food safety, companion animals play a role in COVID-19 epidemiology that opens up new questions. There is evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can infect felines, dogs and minks, and there is evidence of human-to-animal infection. Likewise, the S protein nucleotide sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus isolated in domestic animals and humans is identical, and the replication of the SARS-CoV-2 in cats is efficient. Besides, the epidemiological evidence for this current pandemic indicates that the spillover to humans was associated with close contact between man and exotic animals, very probably in Chinese wet markets, thus there is a growing general consensus that the exotic animal markets, should be strictly regulated. The examination of these findings and the particular role of animals in COVID-19 should be carefully analyzed in order to establish preparation and containment measures. Animal management and epidemiological surveillance must be also considered for COVID-19 control, and it can open up new questions regarding COVID-19 epidemiology and the role that animals play in it.","Hernández, Marta; Abad, David; Eiros, José María; Rodríguez-Lázaro, David",Pathogens,,597

347325,The effect of COVID-19 in a newly established burn center,2021,"BACKGROUND: A system of photosensitive retinal ganglion cells provides 'non-visual' information on the circadian sequences of light to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which, as the 'master clock', synchronizes the chronobiological mechanisms of all the biological clocks. Damage to SCN structure alters circadian behavioral and hormonal rhythms and interferes with a regular sleep-wake pattern. Several studies have shown that, in aging and in Alzheimer's disease (AD), circadian rhythms change their synchronization with the environment and behavior loses sync with light. OBJECTIVE: The current overview aims to examine research studies showing the effect of bright light therapy (BLT) on sleep disorders and sleep-wake patterns in AD. METHODS: A literature search was conducted, taking into consideration the relevant studies over the last 20 years. Fifteen studies have been thorough: seven followed an environmental-architectural approach and eight followed a treatment devices approach. RESULTS: Studies agree in considering BLT as a promising non-pharmacological intervention to compensate for circadian rhythm alterations and they support the need for standardized protocols that allow a comparison between multicenter studies. CONCLUSION: Interestingly, in an attempt to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, health authorities have forced the population to stay home. Therefore, AD people are not currently able to enjoy exposure to sunlight. It is predictable that they may experience an exacerbation of circadian disturbances and that the BLT can be an effective response to prevent such exacerbation.","Roccaro, Ilaria; Smirni, Daniela",J Alzheimers Dis,,597

348518,Hypertension Associated Risks during the Covid-19 Pandemic: the Patients' Perception,2021,"OBJECTIVES: COVID-19 is a public health emergency of international concern whose detection in recovered asymptomatic patients is dependent on accurate diagnosis as it enables the estimation of the susceptibility of the population to the infection. This demand has resulted in the development of several commercial assays employing recombinant proteins, but the results of these assays are not reliable as they do not involve comparison with natural viral antigens. We independently used the SARS-CoV-2 whole viral antigen (WVA) and recombinant nucleocapsid protein (rNP) to develop in-house ELISAs for IgG detection; the results of these ELISAs were then compared to obtain reliable results. METHODS: WVA and rNP ELISAs were performed on COVID-19 negative sera from patients before the pandemic in Brazil, and on RT-qPCR-positive or SARS-CoV-2-IgG against rNP and IgG against WVA-positive samples from recently infected patients in Sao Paulo, Brazil. RESULTS: Both ELISAs detected a large fraction of infected patients but exhibited certain drawbacks. Higher signals and lower numbers of false-negatives were observed in rNP ELISA; however, a higher fraction of false-positives was observed in control groups. A high number of false-negatives was observed with WVA ELISA. Correlating the results of rNP and WVA ELISAs resulted in improved performance for COVID-19 diagnosis. CONCLUSION: The choice of antigen is an important aspect in optimizing the laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19. The use of rNP ELISA for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies seems promising, but comparison of the results with those of WVA ELISA is crucial for accurate test development prior to commercialization. IgG serology using several assays, and with the spectral patterns of SARS-CoV-2, resulted in confusing information that must be clarified before the establishment of diagnostic serology criteria.","Meireles, Luciana Regina; da Silva, Angélica Moura Freixeira; Carvalho, Camila Aparecida; Kesper, Norival; Galisteo Jr, Andrés Jimenez; Soares, Camila Pereira; Araujo, Danielle Bastos; Durigon, Edison Luiz; Oliveira, Danielle Bruna Leal; Morganti, Lígia; Chura-Chambi, Rosa Maria; de Andrade Jr, Heitor Franco",Clinics,,597

349428,A review on COVID-19 for medical students,2021,"BACKGROUND: This paper critically discusses the use and merits of global indices, in particular, the Global Health Security Index (GHSI; Cameron et al. https://www.ghsindex.org/#l-section--map ) in times of an imminent crisis, such as the current pandemic. This index ranked 195 countries according to their expected preparedness in the case of a pandemic or other biological threat. The coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic provides the background to compare each country's predicted performance from the GHSI with the actual performance. In general, there is an inverted relation between predicted versus actual performance, i.e. the predicted top performers are among those that are the worst hit. Obviously, this reflects poorly on the potential policy uses of this index in imminent crisis management. METHODS: The paper analyses the GHSI and identifies why it may have struggled to predict actual pandemic preparedness as evidenced by the Covid-19 pandemic. The paper also uses two different data sets, one from the Worldmeter on the spread of the Covid-19 pandemics, and the other from the International Network for Government Science Advice (INGSA) Evidence-to-Policy Tracker, to draw comparisons between the actual introduction of pandemic response policies and the corresponding death rate in 29 selected countries. RESULTS: This paper analyses the reasons for the poor match between prediction and reality in the index, and mentions six general observations applying to global indices in this respect. These observations are based on methodological and conceptual analyses. The level of abstraction in these global indices builds uncertainties upon uncertainties and hides implicit value assumptions, which potentially removes them from the policy needs on the ground. CONCLUSIONS: From the analysis, the question is raised if the policy community might have better tools for decision-making in a pandemic. On the basis of data from the INGSA Evidence-to-Policy Tracker, and with backing in studies from social psychology and philosophy of science, some simple heuristics are suggested, which may be more useful than a global index.","Kaiser, Matthias; Chen, Andrew Tzer-Yeu; Gluckman, Peter",Health Res Policy Syst,,597

A total of 133 college students from different U.S. universities completed a short online questionnaire as soon as they came back from their study abroad experience (T1) and approximately six months after (T2), when they were resuming their Fall 2020 academic semester. Consistent with the stress process model, secondary stressors associated with reacculturation were predictive, concurrently and longitudinally, of mental health outcomes, especially loneliness, indicating that students who had the hardest time returning home unexpectedly were at the highest risk for worsened mental health over the following months. These findings reveal that reacculturation following unplanned termination of a study abroad experience is not an event as much as it is a process that unfolds over a period of months, as would be understood from the perspective of the stress process model.","Fanari, Alice Segrin Chris",International Journal of Intercultural Relations,,597

In locations with significant rates of viral transmission, social distancing measures and enforced 'lockdowns' are the new 'norm' as governments try to prevent healthcare services from being overwhelmed. However, with these measures have come important challenges for the delivery of existing services for other diseases and conditions. The clinical care of patients with pituitary disorders typically involves a multidisciplinary team, working in concert to deliver timely, often complex, disease investigation and management, including pituitary surgery. COVID-19 has brought about major disruption to such services, limiting access to care and opportunities for testing (both laboratory and radiological), and dramatically reducing the ability to safely undertake transsphenoidal surgery. In the absence of clinical trials to guide management of patients with pituitary disease during the COVID-19 pandemic, herein the Professional Education Committee of the Pituitary Society proposes guidance for continued safe management and care of this population.","Fleseriu, Maria; Buchfelder, Michael; Cetas, Justin S; Fazeli, Pouneh K; Mallea-Gil, Susana M; Gurnell, Mark; McCormack, Ann; Pineyro, Maria M; Syro, Luis V; Tritos, Nicholas A; Marcus, Hani J",Pituitary,,597

351156,Management changes for patients with endocrine-related cancers in the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Infectious pollutants bioaerosols can threaten human public health. In particular, the indoor environment provides a unique exposure situation to induce infection through airborne transmission like SARS-CoV-2. To prevent the infection from spreading, personal protective equipment or indoor air purification is necessary. However, it has been discovered that the conventional filter can become contaminated by pathogen-containing aerosols, meaning that advanced filtering and self-sterilization systems are required. Here, we fabricate a multilayered nanocoating around the fabric using laponite (LAP) with Cu2+ ions (LAP-Cu2+ nanocoating) two contradictory functions in one system: trapping proteinaceous pathogens and antibacterial. Due to the strong LAP-protein interaction, albumin and spike protein (S-protein) are trapped into the fabric when proteins are sprayed using a nebulizer. The protein-blocking performance of the nanocoated fabric is 9.55-fold higher than bare fabric. These trapping capacities are retained after rinsing and repeated adsorption cycles, showing reproducibility for air filtration. Even though the protein-binding occurred, the LAP-Cu2+ fabric indicates antibacterial effect. LAP-Cu2+ fabric has an equivalent air and water transmittance rate to that of bare fabric with a stability under physiological environment. Therefore, given its excellent ""Spear-and-shield"" functions, the proposed LAP-Cu2+ fabric shows great potential for use in filter and masks during the viral pandemic.","Choi, Daheui; Choi, Moonhyun; Jeong, Hyejoong; Heo, Jiwoong; Kim, Taihyun; Park, Sohyeon; Jin, Youngho; Lee, Sangmin; Hong, Jinkee",Chem Eng J,,597

DESIGN: this is a retrospective/prospective observational hospital cohort. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: the study population includes all patients consecutively admitted to the emergency department of Città della salute e della scienza University Hospital from 01.03 to 31.05.2020 with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: patients were classified in two groups according to the findings of X-ray imaging, lung ultrasound and chest computer tomography, as pneumonia or not pneumonia patients. RESULTS: in multivariable analysis, factors most strongly associated with emergency department admission with pneumonia were age, oxygen saturation <90% (adj OR 4.16 ;95%CI 1.44-12.07), respiratory rate >24 breaths/min (adj OR 6.50; 95%CI 2.36-17.87), fever &#8805;38° (adj OR 3.05; 95%CI 1.53-6.08) and the presence of gastroenteric symptoms (vomiting and diarrhea). A delay (> 7 days) between the appearance of the initial lung symptoms (cough and dyspnea) and the admission to the emergency department was also related to a higher probability of receiving a positive imaging report (OR 4.99; 95%CI 2,02-12,34). CONCLUSIONS: in order to reorganize the management of COVID-19 patients in Italy, in view of the risk of a second wave of epidemic or of local outbreaks, it would be desirable to relocate the triage, and possibly the patient's care, from hospital to home.

An evidence-based review,2021,"Arsenic intoxication affects male reproductive parameters of prepubertal rats. Besides, morphological and functional alterations in their testis and epididymis may remain after withdrawal of arsenic insult, causing potential impairment in male fertility during adulthood. In this study, we aimed at analyzing the effect of prepubertal arsenic exposure on the fecundity of epididymal sperm from sexually mature Wistar rats, assessing fertility indexes, sperm parameters, and sperm phosphoproteins content. Male pups on postnatal day (PND) 21 received filtered water (controls, n = 10) and 10 mg L-1 arsenite (n = 10) daily for 30 days. From PND52 to PND81, rats from both groups received filtered water. During this period, the males mated with non-exposed females between PND72 and PND75. Our results showed that sexually mature rats presented low sperm production, epididymal sperm count, motility, and quality after prepubertal arsenic exposure. These findings possibly contributed to the low fertility potential and high preimplantation loss. Epididymal sperm proteome detected 268 proteins, which 170 were found in animals from both control and arsenic groups, 27 proteins were detected only in control animals and 71 proteins only in arsenic-exposed rats. In these animals, SPATA 18 and other five proteins were upregulated, whereas keratin type II cytoskeletal 1 was downregulated (q < 0.1). The results of KEGG pathway analysis demonstrated an enrichment of pathways related to dopaminergic response, adrenergic signaling, protein degradation, and oocyte meiosis in arsenic-exposed animals. Moreover, 26 proteins were identified by phosphoproteomic with different phosphorylation pattern in animals from both groups, but SPATA18 was phosphorylated only in arsenic-exposed animals. We concluded that prepubertal exposure to arsenic is deleterious to sperm quality and male fertility, altering the sperm phosphoproteins profile.","Couto-Santos, Felipe; Viana, Arabela Guedes de Azevedo; Souza, Ana Cláudia Ferreira; Dutra, Alexandre Augusto de Assis; Mendes, Tiago Antônio de Oliveira; Ferreira, André Teixeira da Silva; Aguilar, Jonas Enrique Perales; Oliveira, Leandro Licursi; Machado-Neves, Mariana",Toxicology,,597

Other specimen types such as deep throat saliva (DTS), also known as posterior oropharyngeal saliva and lower-respiratorytract specimens (LRT) including sputum, tracheal aspirate and bronchoalveolar lavage are not validated. These non-validated specimen types, however, do have significant diagnostic value. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the performance of Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2 from DTS and LRT specimens. METHODS: 162 specimens from 158 patients with suspected COVID-19 disease were tested with Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay. These included 120 DTS and 42 LRT specimens i.e. 35 sputum, 6 tracheal aspirate and one bronchoalveolar lavage. Results were compared to those by the TIB-Molbiol LightMix® SarbecoV E-gene assay. RESULTS: Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay has satisfactory performance when compared with reference method. The positive percent agreement (PPA) of DTS and LRT specimens were 98.86 % & 100 % respectively while the negative percent agreement (NPA) was 100 % for both DTS and LRT specimens. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated with appropriate sample pre-treatment, Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay can be used to test on non-validated specimen types including DTS & LRT specimens.","Wong, River Chun-Wai; Wong, Ann Han; Ho, Yolanda Iok-Ieng; Leung, Eddie Chi-Man; Lai, Raymond Wai-Man",J Clin Virol,,597

Age-old passive immunization with protective antibodies to neutralize the virus is one of the strategies for emergency prophylaxis and therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this review, the authors discuss up-to-date advances in immune-based therapy for COVID-19. The use of convalescent plasma therapy as the first line of defense to treat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been established, with encouraging results. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that bind to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein or block the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor have been found to be very promising as a countermeasure for tackling the SARS-CoV-2 infection, and clinical trials are underway. Considering the counterproductive antibody-dependent enhancement of the virus, mAbs therapy that is safe and efficacious, even in people with underlying conditions, will be a significant breakthrough. In addition, emerging immunotherapeutic interventions using nanobodies and cellular immunotherapy are promising avenues for tackling the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors also discuss the implication of mAbs as mediators of cytokine storm syndrome to modify the immune response of COVID-19 patients, thus reducing the fatality rate of COVID-19 infection.","Sajna, Kuttuvan Valappil; Kamat, Siya",Cytotherapy,,597

This case study was conducted as follows: (1) a questionnaire for teachers was distributed via e-mail;(2) teachers' responses were collected and processed;(3) a questionnaire for students was created in Google Forms;(4) students' responses were collected and processed;(5) the research results were described and analyzed;and (6) teachers' and students' responses were compared. The study involved 45 teachers and 100 foreign students, mostly from China. The majority of teachers taught at Level A2 (48%);the majority of students studied at Level B1 (36%). The study shows that modern teachers (77.8%) have a high degree of adaptability, which allows them to switch to new teaching formats in two weeks. They use a variety of teaching aids: not only textbooks mandated by the curriculum (100%), but also other textbooks (91.1%), educational materials from the Internet (88.9%), authentic audio/video materials (51.1%), and self-developed educational materials (53.3%). According to students, the most effective are the authentic materials from the Internet (45%), and the textbook mandated by the program (41%). Both teachers and students noted difficulties in the online training of four language skills: speaking (35.6% of teachers and 32% of students), writing (17.8% and 32%, respectively), listening (15.6% and 40%), and reading (11.1% and 17%). Teachers lack personal communication with students (35.6%), specialized online tools for teaching Russian as a foreign language (13.3%), and effective means of monitoring the acquisition of educational material (31.1%). They strive to solve these problems through a variety of activities, creating an atmosphere conducive to authentic communication. Research data correspond with the conclusions of methodologists about the fundamentally new nature of the relationship between teachers and students in the virtual environment, which is manifested in a less hierarchic teacher-student relationship due to greater initiative, involvement, and independence of students in an online lesson. The article presents a way to study the perception of changes in the teaching mode by teachers and students. The research enriches the e-learning knowledge area with data on how the sudden mass transition to online foreign language learning was carried out.","Kolesova, Daria V.; Moskovkin, Leonid V.; Popova, Tatiana I.",Electronic Journal of e-Learning,,597

The mechanical stability via pulling of the RBD is 250 pN and 200 pN for CoV2 and CoV1 respectively, and the additional stability observed for CoV2 (â¼50 pN) might play a role in the increasing spread of COVID-19.","Moreira, Rodrigo A; Chwastyk, Mateusz; Baker, Joseph L; Guzman, Horacio V; Poma, Adolfo B",Nanoscale,,597
354999,Behavioral Medicine in the COVID-19 Era: Dawn of the Golden Age,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical efficacy of Xuebijing combined with human immunoglobulin for the treatment of severe and critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted. The clinical data of 65 patients with severe and critical COVID-19 admitted to Chongqing Public Health Medical Center and Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital from January 2020 to March 2020 during the period of supporting to combat COVID-19 by the medical team of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University and Chongqing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine were analyzed. According to different treatment regimens, patients were divided into conventional treatment group (conventional antivirus, anti-infection and symptomatic support treatments), Xuebijing group (Xuebijing was applied to patients with elevated inflammatory cytokines) and combination group (Xuebijing combined with human immunoglobulin, human immunoglobulin was applied to patients with low immunity indicated by monitoring results of lymphocytes and their subsets). The improvement of blood routine examination, blood gas analysis, myocardial enzyme spectrum, liver and kidney function, lymphocytes and their subsets and cytokines as well as severity score in three groups before and after treatment were observed. Kaplan-Meier method was used to draw the 28-day survival curve of each group, and the cumulative survival rate among the groups was compared. RESULTS: Among the 65 severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients, only 20 patients received conventional treatment, 22 patients were treated with Xuebijing based on conventional treatment, and 23 patients were treated with Xuebijing combined with human immunoglobulin based on conventional treatment. Before treatment, CD4+ T cell count in combination group was higher than other two groups, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) was lower than other two groups, while other indicators showed no statistically significant differences among the three groups, suggesting that the baseline of the three groups was relatively balanced before treatment. The patients in the conventional treatment group were relieved after treatment, and it was characterized by that the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were significantly lower than those before treatment [APACHE II score: 5.20±2.74 vs. 6.20±1.93, LDH (µmol×s-1×L-1): 4.1±1.0 vs. 4.7±0.9, both P < 0.01], but there was still liver damage, which was manifested as higher aspartate aminotransferase (AST) than that before treatment [U/L: 30.5 (23.8, 41.5) vs. 21.0 (17.0, 34.0), P < 0.05]. In Xuebijing group, the respiratory function and immunity of patients were improved after treatment, and the improvement degree of the ratio of CD4+ T cell was more significant than that in the conventional treatment group (4.86±6.31 vs. -0.95±12.38, P < 0.05). However, the patients still lived with an ""inflammatory storm"" and liver damage after treatment. It was shown that IL-4 was significantly higher than that before treatment (ng/L: 2.57±1.15 vs. 1.92±1.04, P < 0.05), while albumin (ALB) decreased significantly compared with before treatment [g/L: 33.0 (30.5, 35.6) vs. 36.2 (32.1, 41.4), P < 0.01]. While the treatment of Xuebijing combined with human immunoglobulin could improve patients' respiratory function and enhance their immunity more effectively, it was shown that arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2), T lymphocyte count, ratio of CD4+ T cell, CD4+ T cell count, CD8+ T cell count and CD4+/CD8+ ratio were significantly higher than those before treatment, while ALB, IL-6, APACHE II score and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score were significantly lower than those before treatment. T lymphocyte count, the ratio of CD4+ T cell and IL-6 in combination group were improved more significantly than those in conventional treatment group and Xuebijing group [T lymphocyte count (×109/L): 310.68±359.28 vs. 46.54±240.01, 81.59±256.76; ratio of CD4+ T cell: 14.53±14.49 vs. -0.95±12.38, 4.86±6.31; IL-6 (ng/L): -25.53±39.05 vs. -1.75±5.45, 12.78±44.81], PaO2/FiO2 was improved more significantly as compared with the Xuebijing group [mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa): 146.31±109.73 vs. 59.41±87.70], and the differences were statistically different (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of Xuebijing and human immunoglobulin for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 can improve patients' respiratory function, reduce ""inflammatory storm"", enhance immunity, and alleviate severity of patients' condition.","Chen, Li; Zhang, An; Li, Quntang; Cui, Yong; Yuan, Guodan",Zhonghua Wei Zhong Bing Ji Jiu Yi Xue,,597

At the individual level, the main biological system involved in Covid-19 is the respiratory system. Respiratory complications range from mild flu-like illness symptoms to a fatal respiratory distress syndrome or a severe and fulminant pneumonia. Critically, the presence of a pre-existing cardiovascular disease or its risk factors, such as hypertension or type II diabetes mellitus, increases the chance of having severe complications (including death) if infected by the virus. In addition, the infection can worsen an existing cardiovascular disease or precipitate new ones. This paper presents a contemporary review of cardiovascular complications of Covid-19. It also specifically examines the impact of the disease on those already vulnerable and on the poorly resourced health systems of Africa as well as the potential broader consequences on the socio-economic health of this region.","Ogah, Okechukwu S; Umuerri, Ejiroghene M; Adebiyi, Adewole; Orimolade, Olanike A; Sani, Mahmoud U; Ojji, Dike B; Mbakwem, Amam C; Stewart, Simon; Sliwa, Karen",Glob Heart,,597

356572,OCD during COVID-19: Understanding clinical and non-clinical anxiety in the community,2021,"BACKGROUND: The association of adolescent social media use with mental health symptoms, especially depression, has recently attracted a great deal of interest in public media as well as the scientific community. Some studies have cited statistically significant associations between adolescent social media use and depression and have proposed that parents must regulate their adolescents' social media use in order to protect their mental health. METHOD: In order to rigorously assess the size of the effect that has been reported in the current scientific literature, we conducted a meta-analysis of studies that measured the association between social media use specifically and depressive symptoms amongst early- to mid- adolescents (11-18 years-old). We searched Psychnet, PubMed, and Web of Science with the following terms: online social networks, social media, internet usage, facebook, twitter, instagram, myspace, snapchat, and depression. RESULTS: We found a small but significant positive correlation (k=12 studies, r=.11, p<.01) between adolescent social media use and depressive symptoms. There was also high heterogeneity (I2=95.22%) indicating substantial variation among studies. CONCLUSIONS: High heterogeneity along with the small overall effect size observed in the relationship between self-reported social media use and depressive symptoms suggests that other factors are likely to act as significant moderators of the relationship. We suggest that future research should be focused on understanding which types of use may be harmful (or helpful) to mental health, rather than focusing on overall use measures that likely reflect highly heterogeneous exposures.","Ivie, Elizabeth J; Pettitt, Adam; Moses, Louis J; Allen, Nicholas B",J Affect Disord,,597

To evaluate the seroprevalence of COVID-19 infection in pauci-symptomatic and asymptomatic people, the associated epidemiological factors, and IgG antibody kinetic over a 5-month period to get a better knowledge of the disease transmissibility and the rate of susceptible persons that might be infected. Methods. Seroprevalence was evaluated by a cross-sectional study based on the general population of Santa Fe, Argentina (non-probabilistic sample) carried out between July and November 2020. A subgroup of 20 seropositive individuals was followed-up to analyze IgG persistence. For the IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies detection, the COVID-AR IgG® ELISA kit was used. Results. 3 000 individuals were included conforming asymptomatic and pauci-symptomatic groups (n=1 500 each). From the total sample, only 8.83% (n=265) presented reactivity for IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2. A significant association was observed between positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and a history of contact with a confirmed case; the transmission rate within households was approximately 30%. In the pauci-symptomatic group, among the seropositive ones, anosmia and fever presented an OR of 16.8 (95% CI 9.5-29.8) and 2.7 (95% CI 1.6-4.6), respectively (p &lt;0.001). In asymptomatic patients, IgG levels were lower compared to pauci-symptomatic patients, tending to decline after 4 months since the symptoms onset. Conclusion. We observed a low seroprevalence, suggestive of a large population susceptible to the infection. Anosmia and fever were independent significant predictors for seropositivity. Asymptomatic patients showed lower levels of antibodies during the 5-month follow-up. IgG antibodies tended to decrease over the end of this period regardless of symptoms.","Rodeles, Luz María; Peverengo, Luz María; Benítez, Romina; Benzaquen, Nadia; Serravalle, Priscila; Long, Ana Karina; Ferreira, Virginia; Benitez, Agostina Daiana; Zunino, Luisina; Lizarraga, Camila; Vicco, Miguel Hernán",Rev. panam. salud pública,,597
357198,Essential Gynecologic Surgery during the COVID-19 Pandemic: New York Institutional Experience,2020,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has posed a unique challenge to health care systems globally. To curb COVID-19 transmission, mitigation measures such as travel restrictions, border closures, curfews, lockdowns, and social distancing have been implemented. However, these measures may directly and indirectly affect the delivery and utilization of essential health services, including malaria services. The suspension of indoor residual spraying (IRS) and insecticide-treated net (ITN) distribution, shortages of malaria commodities, and reduced demand for health services have hindered the continued delivery of malaria services. The overall goal of this analysis was to describe the trends in malaria incidence and mortality in Zimbabwe prior to and during the pandemic to understand the consequences of COVID-19-related changes in the delivery and utilization of malaria services. METHODS: Monthly data on the number of malaria cases and deaths by district for the period January 2017 to June 2020 were obtained from the national health management information system (HMIS). District-level population data were obtained from the 2012 Census. Malaria incidence per 1000 population and malaria deaths per 100,000 population were calculated for 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020 and mapped to describe the spatial and temporal variation of malaria at the district level. RESULTS: Compared to the same period in 2017, 2018 and 2019, there was an excess of over 30,000 malaria cases from January to June 2020. The number of malaria deaths recorded in January to June 2020 exceeded the annual totals for 2018 and 2019. District level maps indicated that areas outside high malaria burden provinces experienced higher than expected malaria incidence and mortality, suggesting potential outbreaks. CONCLUSIONS: The observed surge in malaria cases and deaths in January to June 2020 coincided with the onset of COVID-19 in Zimbabwe. While further research is needed to explore possible explanations for the observed trends, prioritizing the continuity of essential malaria services amid the COVID-19 pandemic remains crucial.","Gavi, Samuel; Tapera, Oscar; Mberikunashe, Joseph; Kanyangarara, Mufaro",Malar J,,597

357828,COVID-19 and Kounis Syndrome: Deciphering Their Relationship,2021,"Epidemiological studies based on statistical methods indicate inverse correlations between virus lifetime and both (i) daily mean temperature and (ii) diurnal temperature range (DTR). While thermodynamic models have been used to predict the effect of constant-temperature surroundings on virus inactivation rate, the relationship between virus lifetime and DTR has not been explained using first principles. Here, we model the inactivation of viruses based on temperature-dependent chemical kinetics with a time-varying temperature profile to account for the daily mean temperature and DTR simultaneously. The exponential Arrhenius relationship governing the rate of virus inactivation causes fluctuations above the daily mean temperature during daytime to increase the instantaneous rate of inactivation by a much greater magnitude than the corresponding decrease in inactivation rate during nighttime. This asymmetric behavior results in shorter predicted virus lifetimes when considering DTR and consequently reveals a potential physical mechanism for the inverse correlation observed between the number of cases and DTR reported in statistical epidemiological studies. In light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, a case study on the effect of daily mean temperature and DTR on the lifetime of SARS-CoV-2 was performed for the five most populous cities in the United States. In Los Angeles, where mean monthly temperature fluctuations are low (DTR &#8776; 7 °C), accounting for DTR decreases predicted SARS-CoV-2 lifetimes by only 10%; conversely, accounting for DTR for a similar mean temperature but larger mean monthly temperature fluctuations in Phoenix (DTR &#8776; 15 °C) decreases predicted lifetimes by 50%. The modeling framework presented here provides insight into the independent effects of mean temperature and DTR on virus lifetime, and a significant impact on transmission rate is expected, especially for viruses that pose a high risk of fomite-mediated transmission.","Yap, Te Faye; Decker, Colter J; Preston, Daniel J",Sci Total Environ,,597

In this paper we present results from surveys relating to opening the New Zealand border. METHOD: Three surveys were distributed to primary care practices between May and December 2020. A range of primary care member organisations distributed the survey augmented by snowballing. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics and qualitative data through an inductive process and grouped into themes. RESULTS: Respondents became increasingly supportive of opening a trans-Tasman border but not internationally. Two broad themes were evident: (1) making sure that the border is not an Achilles heel and (2) effective strategies to reduce local transmission. These themes highlight primary care's concerns around management of the border and the management of local spread respectively. CONCLUSION: The results highlight concerns around border control from a primary care perspective.

Of these nucleotide substitutions 58, 94, and 37 were nonsynonymous types mostly present in the Nsp2, Nsp3, Spike, and ORF9. A continent-specific phylogram analyses clustered the SARS-CoV-2 in the different group based on the frequency of nucleotide substitutions. Detailed analyses about the continent-specific amino acid changes and their effectiveness by SNAP2 software was investigated. We found 11 common nonsynonymous mutations; among them, two novel effective mutations were identified in ORF9 (S194L and S202N). Intriguingly, ORF9 encodes nucleocapsid phosphoprotein possessing many effective mutations across continents and could be a potential candidate after the spike protein for studying the role of mutation in viral assembly and pathogenesis. Among the two forms of certain frequent mutation, one form is more prevalent in Europe continents (Nsp12:L314, Nsp13:P504, Nsp13:Y541, Spike:G614, and ORF8:L84) while other forms are more prevalent in American (Nsp12:P314, Nsp13:L504, Nsp13:C541, Spike:D614, and ORF8:L84) and Asian continents (Spike:D614), indicating the spatial and temporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. We identified highly conserved 38 regions and among these regions, 11 siRNAs were predicted on stringent criteria that can be used to suppress the expression of viral genes and the corresponding reduction of human viral infections. The present investigation provides information on different mutations and will pave the way for differentiating strains based on virulence and their use in the development of better antiviral therapy.","Mishra, Divya; Suri, Gurparsad Singh; Kaur, Gurleen; Tiwari, Manish",J Med Virol,,597

Pre-lecture surveys probing students' comfort were administered weekly, in which students assigned themselves a""discomfort level""on a scale of 0--10 and provided a written explanation for their choice. The weekly class-wide average discomfort level was effectively constant over the semester, suggesting that the class found no single unit especially jarring nor especially easy. Student written responses were coded according to their reported source of discomfort---math, math-physics connection, physics, and notation. The relative prevalence of these categories varied significantly over the semester, indicating that students find that different units present different challenges, and also that some of these challenges fade in importance as the semester progresses. Semi-structured interviews with students in a similar quantum mechanics course at a different institution provided additional context and insight into these results.","Corsiglia, Giaco; Garcia, Tyler; Schermerhorn, Benjamin P.; Passante, Gina; Sadaghiani, Homeyra; Pollock, Steven",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.06688v1.pdf,597

This is an observational study of children with COVID-19 infection in hospitals contributing data to the Pediatric Acute and Critical Care COVID-19 Registry of Asia. Laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases were included in this registry. The primary outcome was severity of COVID-19 infection as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) (mild, moderate, severe, or critical). Epidemiology, clinical and laboratory features, and outcomes of children with COVID-19 are described. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify risk factors for severe/critical disease. A total of 260 COVID-19 cases from eight hospitals across seven countries (China, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, India, and Pakistan) were included. The common clinical manifestations were similar across countries: fever (64%), cough (39%), and coryza (23%). Approximately 40% of children were asymptomatic, and overall mortality was 2.3%, with all deaths reported from India and Pakistan. Using the multivariable model, the infant age group, presence of comorbidities, and cough on presentation were associated with severe/critical COVID-19. This epidemiological study of pediatric COVID-19 infection demonstrated similar clinical presentations of COVID-19 in children across Asia. Risk factors for severe disease in children were age younger than 12 months, presence of comorbidities, and cough at presentation.

METHODS: Paediatric patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between January 15 and March 15, 2020, from seven hospitals in Zhejiang Province, China, were collected retrospectively and analysed. RESULTS: Thirty-two children with COVID-19, ranging in age from 3 months to 18 years, were enrolled. Family aggregation occurred in 87.5% of infant and preschool-aged children (7/8), and also school-aged children (14/16), but in only 12.5% (1/8) of adolescents (p < 0.05, p < 0.001). Most of these patients had mild symptoms: mainly fever (20/32) followed by cough (10/32) and fatigue (4/32). The average durations of viral RNA in respiratory samples and gastrointestinal samples were 15.8 d and 28.9 d, respectively. Detox duration in faeces decreased with age: 39.8 d, 27.5 d and 20.4 d in infants and preschool children, school children, and adolescents respectively (p0-6, -18 <0.01, p0-6, -14 <0.05). Pneumonia was found in 14 children, but there was no statistical significance in the incidence of pneumonia between different age groups. Thirty patients were treated with antiviral drugs, and all patients were stable and gradually improved after admission. CONCLUSIONS: Most children with COVID-19 had a mild process and a good prognosis.

360649,The Poison Center as a pandemic response: establishment and characteristics of a COVID-19 hotline through the New Jersey Poison Center,2021,"OBJECTIVE: As COVID-19 spreads across the world, there are concerns that people with asthma are at a higher risk of acquiring the disease, or of poorer outcomes. This systematic review aimed to summarize evidence on the risk of infection, severe illness and death from COVID-19 in people with asthma. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION: A comprehensive search of electronic databases including preprint repositories and WHO COVID-19 database was conducted (until 26 May 2020). Studies reporting COVID-19 in people with asthma were included. For binary outcomes, we performed Sidik-Jonkman random effects meta-analysis. We explored quantitative heterogeneity by subgroup analyses, meta regression and evaluating the I2 statistic. RESULTS: Fifty-seven studies with an overall sample size of 587 280 were included. The prevalence of asthma among those infected with COVID-19 was 7.46% (95% CI = 6.25-8.67). Non-severe asthma was more common than severe asthma (9.61% vs. 4.13%). Pooled analysis showed a 14% risk ratio reduction in acquiring COVID-19 (95% CI = 0.80-0.94; p < 0.0001) and 13% reduction in hospitalization with COVID-19 (95% CI = 0.77-0.99, p = 0.03) for people with asthma compared with those without. There was no significant difference in the combined risk of requiring admission to ICU and/or receiving mechanical ventilation for people with asthma (RR = 0.87 95% CI = 0.94-1.37; p = 0.19) and risk of death from COVID-19 (RR = 0.87; 95% CI = 0.68-1.10; p = 0.25). CONCLUSION: The findings from this study suggest that the prevalence of people with asthma among COVID-19 patients is similar to the global prevalence of asthma. The overall findings suggest that people with asthma have a lower risk than those without asthma for acquiring COVID-19 and have similar clinical outcomes.","Sunjaya, Anthony P; Allida, Sabine M; Di Tanna, Gian Luca; Jenkins, Christine",J Asthma,,597

361747,COVID-19 and infection prevention and control in health facilities,2020,"BACKGROUND: Wildfires in California have become more deadly and destructive in recent years, and four of the ten most destructive fires occurred in 2017 and 2018. Through interviews with service providers, this article explores how these recent wildfires have impacted surrounding communities and the role various recovery resources have played in responding to the short- and long-term health and social needs of survivors. METHODS: Using a purposive sampling methodology, we interviewed 21 health and social service personnel who assisted in wildfire recovery efforts in California in 2017 and 2018. The study participants worked or volunteered in medical facilities, social services agencies and philanthropy/nonprofit organizations located in communities affected by wildfires. Participants were asked about three common, overarching themes that fire-impacted communities navigate post-disaster: health issues, social issues, and response and recovery resources. Inductive coding was used to identify common subthemes. RESULTS: The two most frequently discussed social issues during interviews were housing and employment access. Mental and emotional well-being and access to health resources were identified as being the most challenging health concerns that survivors face post-disaster. Participants also identified the following private and public recovery resources that survivors use to attempt to restabilize following the fire: community support, county agencies, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA,) insurance companies and philanthropic organizations. However, participants noted that the cumulative impacts of these efforts still leave many of their patients and clients without the resources needed to restabilize emotionally, financially and physically. Finally, participants spoke about the community-wide, downstream impacts of wildfires, noting that ""survivors"" are not only those whose health is immediately compromised by the disaster. CONCLUSION: Given the worsening wildfire seasons in California, we must increase our understanding of both the scope of the health and social issues that survivors navigate following a disaster, as well as the effectiveness and sustainability of recovery resources available to survivors. We must also understand the ""ripple effect"" that wildfires have on surrounding communalities, impacting housing access, social services, and health care access. More research and support, especially during the current COVID-19 pandemic, is urgently needed to improve our ability to support the health and social needs of wildfire survivors in the future.","Rosenthal, Annie; Stover, Eric; Haar, Rohini J",PLoS One,,597

Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has defined the infection as a global pandemic and there is a health and social emergency for the management of this new infection. While most people with COVID-19 develop only mild or uncomplicated illness, approximately 14% develop severe disease that requires hospitalization and oxygen support, and 5% require admission to an intensive care unit. In severe cases, COVID-19 can be complicated by the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, and multiorgan failure.

Strangely, ample evidences have been shown that the severity of COVID-19 infections varies widely from children (asymptomatic), adults (mild infection), as well as elderly adults (deadly critical). It has proven that COVID-19 infection in some elderly critical adults leads to a cytokine storm, which is characterized by severe systemic elevation of several pro-inflammatory cytokines. Then, a cytokine storm can induce edematous, ARDS, pneumonia, as well as multiple organ failure in aged patients. It is far from clear till now why cytokine storm induces in only COVID-19 elderly patients, and not in young patients. However, it seems that aging is associated with mild elevated levels of local and systemic pro-inflammatory cytokines, which is characterized by ""inflamm-aging"". It is highly likely that ""inflamm-aging"" is correlated to increased risk of a cytokine storm in some critical elderly patients with COVID-19 infection.

And meanwhile highlighted the important meanings for every stomatologists. Firstly, from the history of dentistry or stomatology, the establishment of occlusion and gnathology drived the transformation of dentistry from a craft practice into an independent profession and discipline. Secondly, from the evolution of occlusion, jaw, and TMJ, this article clarified the distinctiveness and uniqueness of occlusion, jaw and TMJ that made modern human beings the most highly endowed. Thirdly, teeth and other oral organs not only have masticatory and digestive functions but also possess more complex social functions. Stomatognathic system is a more accurate conception than oral organs which is usually called. The conception of stomatognathic system gives a clearer sense of wholeness and more beneficial for accurate diagnosis and treatment of occlusion-related diseases as well as temporomandibular disorders.

It is necessary for not only general stomatoloaists but also other dental specialists in stomatology to clearly understand the principal theories and proficiently master the management capability on occlusion, gnathology and temporomandibular disorders.","Zhang, Z K",Zhonghua Kou Qiang Yi Xue Za Zhi,,597
364067,Tolstoy in the Time of Covid,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19, the presently prevailing global public health emergency has culminated in international instability in economy. This unprecedented pandemic outbreak pressingly necessitated the trans-disciplinary approach in developing novel/new anti-COVID-19 drugs especially, small molecule inhibitors targeting the seminal proteins of viral etiological agent, SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Based on the traditional medicinal knowledge, we made an attempt through molecular docking analysis to explore the phytochemical constituents of three most commonly used Indian herbs in 'steam inhalation therapy' against well recognized viral receptor proteins. RESULTS: A total of 57 phytochemicals were scrutinized virtually against four structural protein targets of SARS-CoV-2 viz. 3CLpro, ACE-2, spike glycoprotein and RdRp. Providentially, two bioactives from each of the three plants i.e. apigenin-o-7-glucuronide and ellagic acid from Eucalyptus globulus; eudesmol and viridiflorene from Vitex negundo and; vasicolinone and anisotine from Justicia adhatoda were identified to be the best hit lead molecules based on interaction energies, conventional hydrogen bonding numbers and other non-covalent interactions. On comparison with the known SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibitor -lopinavir and RdRp inhibitor -remdesivir, apigenin-o-7-glucuronide was found to be a phenomenal inhibitor of both protease and polymerase, as it strongly interacts with their active sites and exhibited remarkably high binding affinity. Furthermore, in silico drug-likeness and ADMET prediction analyses clearly evidenced the usability of the identified bioactives to develop as drug against COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Overall, the data of the present study exemplifies that the phytochemicals from selected traditional herbs having significance in steam inhalation therapy would be promising in combating COVID-19.","Gowrishankar, Shanmugaraj; Muthumanickam, Sankar; Kamaladevi, Arumugam; Karthika, Chandrasekar; Jothi, Ravi; Boomi, Pandi; Maniazhagu, Dharuman; Pandian, Shunmugiah Karutha",Food Chem Toxicol,,597

364383,Clinical pathways for patients with giant cell arteritis during the COVID-19 pandemic: an international perspective,2020,"Patients with pre-existing chronic diseases are more susceptible to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), yet the underlying causes of increased risk are of infection remain unclear. Angiotensin-converting- enzyme 2 (ACE2), the cell surface receptor that recognizes the coronavirus spike protein has protective effects against inflammation and chronic hyperglycemia in animal models. The roles of ACE2 in severe SARS-CoV-2 infections remains ambiguous due to contradictory findings. In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between human plasma ACE2 levels in diabetics and the high risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. First, the medical records of 245 patients with SARS-CoV-2-positive who have chronic diseases were analyzed. We also recruited 404 elderly subjects with comorbid chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, hypertension and obesity, and investigated the ACE2 plasma levels. Plasma concentrations of ACE2 were much lower (2973.83±2196.79 pg/mL) in diabetics with chronic disease than in healthy controls (4308.21±2352.42 pg/ml), and the use of hypoglycemia drugs was associated with lower circulating concentrations of ACE2 (P=1.49E-08). Diabetics with lower plasma levels of ACE2 may be susceptible to severe COVID-19. Our findings suggest that the poor prognosis in patients with diabetes infected with SARS-CoV-2 may be due to low circulating ACE2 levels.","Zhang, Yanliang; Sun, Yangyang; Liu, Kang; Alolga, Raphael N; Xu, Xueqiang; Feng, Ganzhu; Xiao, Pingxi",Aging (Albany NY),,597

The purpose of the current study was to examine whether family systems therapists increased their teletherapy use during the pandemic relative to prepandemic usage, and whether projected postpandemic rates would remain at the same level; further, environmental and demographic predictors of these changes were examined. In May 2020, a sample of 626 family systems therapists (58.6% women, 40.6% men; M = 57.4 years old; M years in practice = 25.5) completed a national online study assessing these variables. Results suggested that family systems therapists performed 7.92% of their clinical work using teletherapy before the pandemic and 88.17% during the pandemic. They also projected that they would perform 36.57% of their clinical work using teletherapy after the pandemic. Teletherapy uptake was unrelated to primary practice setting, provider age, gender, race/ethnicity, and practice location (urban/suburban vs. rural) but was higher for family systems therapists who reported increased supportive teletherapy policies and training in their practice setting. Organizational infrastructure and availability of training played an important role in influencing teletherapy uptake during the pandemic. Family systems therapists have a unique opportunity to deploy teletherapy modalities to meet the needs of families during the COVID-19 pandemic, and infrastructure and training to do so may facilitate that work.","McKee, Grace B; Pierce, Bradford S; Tyler, Carmen M; Perrin, Paul B; Elliott, Timothy R",Fam. process,,597
364761,EKG-gyöngyszem: EKG a beteg hátán a COVID-19-pandémiában,2020,"Neutralizing antibodies are key determinants of protection from future infection, yet well-validated high-throughput assays for measuring titers of SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies are not generally available. Here, we describe the development and validation of IMMUNO-COV v2.0, a scalable surrogate virus assay, which titrates antibodies that block infection of Vero-ACE2 cells by a luciferase-encoding vesicular stomatitis virus displaying SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins (VSV-SARS2-Fluc). Antibody titers, calculated using a standard curve consisting of stepped concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 spike monoclonal antibody, correlated closely (P < 0.0001) with titers obtained from a gold standard 50% plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT50%) performed using a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2. IMMUNO-COV v2.0 was comprehensively validated using data acquired from 242 assay runs performed over 7 days by five analysts, utilizing two separate virus lots, and 176 blood samples. Assay performance was acceptable for clinical use in human serum and plasma based on parameters including linearity, dynamic range, limit of blank and limit of detection, dilutional linearity and parallelism, precision, clinical agreement, matrix equivalence, clinical specificity and sensitivity, and robustness. Sufficient VSV-SARS2-Fluc virus reagent has been banked to test 5 million clinical samples. Notably, a significant drop in IMMUNO-COV v2.0 neutralizing antibody titers was observed over a 6-month period in people recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Together, our results demonstrate the feasibility and utility of IMMUNO-COV v2.0 for measuring SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies in vaccinated individuals and those recovering from natural infections. Such monitoring can be used to better understand what levels of neutralizing antibodies are required for protection from SARS-CoV-2 and what booster dosing schedules are needed to sustain vaccine-induced immunity. IMPORTANCE Since its emergence at the end of 2019, SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, has caused over 100 million infections and 2.4 million deaths worldwide. Recently, countries have begun administering approved COVID-19 vaccines, which elicit strong immune responses and prevent disease in most vaccinated individuals. A key component of the protective immune response is the production of neutralizing antibodies capable of preventing future SARS-CoV-2 infection. Yet, fundamental questions remain regarding the longevity of neutralizing antibody responses following infection or vaccination and the level of neutralizing antibodies required to confer protection. Our work is significant as it describes the development and validation of a scalable clinical assay that measures SARS-CoV-2-neutraling antibody titers. We have critical virus reagent to test over 5 million samples, making our assay well suited for widespread monitoring of SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies, which can in turn be used to inform vaccine dosing schedules and answer fundamental questions regarding SARS-CoV-2 immunity.","Vandergaast, Rianna; Carey, Timothy; Reiter, Samantha; Lathrum, Chase; Lech, Patrycja; Gnanadurai, Clement; Haselton, Michelle; Buehler, Jason; Narjari, Riya; Schnebeck, Luke; Roesler, Anne; Sevola, Kara; Suksanpaisan, Lukkana; Bexon, Alice; Naik, Shruthi; Brunton, Bethany; Weaver, Scott C; Rafael, Grace; Tran, Sheryl; Baum, Alina; Kyratsous, Christos A; Peng, Kah Whye; Russell, Stephen J",mSphere,,597

OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether particular cytokine profiles are associated with COVID-19 severity and mortality. METHODS: Cytokine concentrations and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antigen were measured at hospital admission in serum of symptomatic patients with COVID-19 (N = 115), classified at hospitalization into 3 respiratory severity groups: no need for mechanical ventilatory support (No-MVS), intermediate severity requiring mechanical ventilatory support (MVS), and critical severity requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Principal-component analysis was used to characterize cytokine profiles associated with severity and mortality. The results were thereafter confirmed in an independent validation cohort (N = 86). RESULTS: At time of hospitalization, ECMO patients presented a dominant proinflammatory response with elevated levels of TNF-&#945;, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10. In contrast, an elevated type-I interferon response involving IFN-&#945; and IFN-ß was characteristic of No-MVS patients, whereas MVS patients exhibited both profiles. Mortality at 1 month was associated with higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines in ECMO patients, higher levels of type-I interferons in No-MVS patients, and their combination in MVS patients, resulting in a combined mortality prediction accuracy of 88.5% (risk ratio, 24.3; P < .0001). Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antigen levels correlated with type-I interferon levels and were associated with mortality, but not with proinflammatory response or severity. CONCLUSIONS: Distinct cytokine profiles are observed in association with COVID-19 severity and are differentially predictive of mortality according to oxygen support modalities.

We profiled eGDR in younger adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) by their demographic and clinical characteristics. METHODS: In this single centre study, medical records of TIDM were assessed and eGDR tertiles correlated with demographic and clinical variables. RESULTS: Of 175 T1DM individuals, 108 (61.7%) were males. Mean age (±SD) was 22.0 ± 1.6 years and median time from diagnosis 11.0 years (range 1-23). Individuals were predominantly Caucasian (81.7%), with 27.4% being overweight (BMI: 25-30 kg/m2) and 13.7% obese (BMI > 30 kg/m2). Mean total cholesterol (TC) levels were significantly lower in high and middle eGDR tertiles (4.4 ± 1 and 4.3 ± 0.8 mmol/l, respectively) compared with low eGDR tertile (4.8 ± 1, p < 0.05 for both). Triglyceride (TG) levels showed a similar trend at 1.1 ± 0.5 and 1.1 ± 0.5 mmol/l for high and middle eGDR tertile compared to low eGDR tertile (1.5 ± 1 mmol/l, p < 0.05 for both). Renal function was similar across eGDR tertiles and no difference in retinopathy was detected. CONCLUSION: TC and TG are altered in individuals with T1DM and low eGDR, suggesting that this subgroup requires optimal lipid management to ameliorate their vascular risk.","Nishtala, Revathi; Kietsiriroje, Noppadol; Karam, Mohammad; Ajjan, Ramzi A; Pearson, Sam",Diab Vasc Dis Res,,597

366972,COVID-19 pandemic: A perspective from nephrology resident,2021,"This study examines how job search behavior changed at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the weeks following the event's onset, and if the physical contact required by different jobs moderated these trends. Based on event system theory, we argue that the onset of the pandemic created a strong event because it was highly novel, disruptive, and critical. We test this by examining 16 weeks of job applications for 14 organizations that differ in terms of whether the jobs require employees to work from home or face-to-face. We use Bliese, Adler, and Flynn's (2017) transition framework and discontinuous random coefficient growth curve modeling to test the pandemic's effect on job search behavior both during the event onset and then the weeks following the onset. Importantly, we include a 9-week preonset baseline period to provide more rigorous tests of change. Results show that the onset of the pandemic created an immediate increase in job search behavior (job applications), and this effect endured into the postonset period. Job type moderated these trends, such that the onset and postonset applications were substantially greater for work-from-home jobs (which followed a negatively accelerated curve) compared to face-to-face jobs. These findings advance the job search literature by introducing event system theory and transition frameworks to better understand how and why events uniquely influence job search behavior over time.

The response is from a K-12 educational environment perspective. Willis, Slade, and Prinsloo's typology of different ethical approaches to learning analytics adds value to the special issue topic of shifting to digital as it provides different ways to view learning analytics as well as the type of approval(s) possibly needed for each view. K-12 educational institutions can utilize the manuscript as a starting place for review of their ethical oversights when analyzing student data as more schools are shifting to digital. A limitation of Willis, Slade, and Prinsloo's manuscript in supporting the shift to digital is that the manuscript was published before the overwhelming shift to digital was mandated as a result of Covid-19. Future work related to the manuscript and with a focus on the K-12 educational environment could include K-12 education agencies deriving a K-12 specific typology from a review of ethical oversight protocols or analyzing the effects of the shift to digital in K-12 on the original typology. During the 2020 pandemic, K-12 schools in the United States moved to digital learning quickly and in large numbers. This move has resulted in a wealth of digital learning analytics available to be used in improving student learning outcomes. However, local education agencies must first make sure they have a clear framework for oversight of how digital learning analytics will be used. K-12 students are at risk of harm if local education agencies do not stop and carefully reflect on the potential risks to students resulting from decisions made as a result of using digital learning analytics.","Beerwinkle, Andrea L",Educ Technol Res Dev,,597

This study examined the extent to which common inpatient elective operations consume acute care resources. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used the Premier Healthcare Database to examine the distribution of inpatient elective operations in the United States from the fourth quarter of 2015 through the second quarter of 2018. Primary outcomes were measures of acute care use after 4 common elective operations: joint replacement, spinal fusion, bariatric surgery, and coronary artery bypass grafting. A framework for matching changing demand with changes in supply was created by overlaying acute care data with publicly available outbreak capacity data. RESULTS: Elective coronary artery bypass grafting (n = 117 423) had the highest acute care use: 92.8% of patients used intensive care unit beds, 89.1% required postoperative mechanical ventilation, 41.0% required red blood cell transfusions, and 13.3% were readmitted within 90 days of surgery. Acute care use was also substantial after spinal fusion (n = 203 789): 8.3% of patients used intensive care unit beds, 2.2% required postoperative mechanical ventilation, 9.2% required red blood cell transfusions, and 9.3% were readmitted within 90 days of surgery. An example of a framework for matching hospital demand with elective surgery supply is provided. CONCLUSIONS: Acute care needs after elective surgery in the United States are consistent and predictable. When these data are overlaid with national hospital capacity models, rational decisions regarding matching supply to demand can be achieved to meet changing needs.","Krishnamoorthy, Vijay; Ohnuma, Tetsu; Bartz, Raquel; Fuller, Matthew; Khandelwal, Nita; Haines, Krista; Scales, Charles; Raghunathan, Karthik",Am J Crit Care,,597

Human neutrophil elastase is known to play multiple roles in the human body, but an increase in its activity may cause a variety of diseases. Elastase inhibitors may prevent the development of psoriasis, chronic kidney disease, respiratory disorders (including COVID-19), immune disorders, and even cancers. Among polyphenolic compounds, some flavonoids and their derivatives, which are mostly found in herbal plants, have been revealed to influence elastase release and its action on human cells. This review focuses on elastase inhibitors that have been discovered from natural sources and are biochemically characterised as flavonoids. The inhibitory activity on elastase is a characteristic of flavonoid aglycones and their glycoside and methylated, acetylated and hydroxylated derivatives. The presented analysis of structure-activity relationship (SAR) enables the determination of the chemical groups responsible for evoking an inhibitory effect on elastase. Further study especially of the in vivo efficacy and safety of the described natural compounds is of interest in order to gain better understanding of their health-promoting potential.","Jakimiuk, Katarzyna; Gesek, Jakub; Atanasov, Atanas G; Tomczyk, Michal",J Enzyme Inhib Med Chem,,597

In the absence of any specific antiviral drug/vaccine, COVID-19 related drug repurposing along with various other non-pharmacological measures coupled with lockdown have been employed to combat this infection. In this context, a plant based rich fiber diet, which happens to be consumed by a majority of the Indian population, appears to be advantageous, as it replenishes the host gut microbiota with beneficial microbes thereby leading to a symbiotic association conferring various health benefits to the host including enhanced immunity. Further, implementation of the lockdown which has proven to be a good non-pharmacological measure, seems to have resulted in consumption of home cooked healthy diet, thereby enriching the beneficial microflora in the gut, which might have resulted in better prognosis of COVID-19 patients in India in comparison to that observed in the western countries.","Rishi, Praveen; Thakur, Khemraj; Vij, Shania; Rishi, Lavanya; Singh, Aagamjit; Kaur, Indu Pal; Patel, Sanjay K S; Lee, Jung-Kul; Kalia, Vipin C",Indian J Microbiol,,597

369396,129 “Pop-Up” Specialist End of Life Ward For COVID-19—The Nottingham Experience,2021,"Introduction: Severe COVID-19 is associated with high rates of intensive care unit (ICU) delirium and prolonged mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory distress syndrome. We hypothesize that COVID-19 ICU survivors are at high risk for developing post-intensive care syndrome (PICS), namely long-term cognitive, psychiatric, and physical impairments which persist after ICU hospitalization. Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study at two sites of 49 patients who met the following inclusion criteria: age 18 or older, admitted to the medical ICU, had a positive COVID-19 nasopharyngeal swab, and attended at least one outpatient visit at the Indiana University School of Medicine's Critical Care Recovery Center (CCRC). Patients were administered assessments by trained personnel of cognition (Mini Mental State Exam [MMSE] or Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA]) and self-reported scales for depression (Patient Health Questionarre-9 [PHQ-9]), anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder-7 [GAD-7]), post-traumatic stress disorder (Post Traumatic Symptom Scale-10 [PTSS-10]), quality of life and physical functioning (EuroQol-5D Quality of Life questionnaire [EQ5D QoL], EuroQol-5D5L [EQ5D5L], Healthy Age Brain Care Monitor Self Report [HABC-SR]). Descriptive statistics were computed as frequency, mean, and standard deviation using SPSS. Results: A total of 49 patients were included in the study with 30.6% female, mean age of 51.89 (SD 13.95). Nearly all patients (93.9%) required mechanical ventilation while hospitalized. The average hospital length of stay was 23.06 days (SD 12.3) and the mean days from discharge to initial evaluation in the CCRC was 87.3 (SD 43.2). Scores suggestive of mild cognitive impairment were seen in 23.3% (n = 36) of patients who performed the MMSE and in 37.5% (n = 16) of patients who completed the MoCA. Of the patients who participated in the PHQ-9, 33.3% (n = 36) had an abnormal score consistent with at least mild depression. 21.1% (n = 47) of the patients had abnormal scores on the functional subscale of the HABC-SR. Most notably, the mean quality of life score was 67.8 (SD 19.08) using the EQ5D QoL. Conclusions: ICU hospitalization for severe COVID-19 symptoms may be associated with long-term impairments in cognition, mental health, and physical function consistent with PICS. Larger observational cohort studies are needed to have a deeper understanding of COVID-19-related PICS, risk factors for COVID-19 PICS, and factors affecting recovery from PICS. These results emphasize the importance of continued focused assessment of ICU survivors to help identify and treat impairments in these domains in order to improve quality of life.","Seyffert, S.

369429,The COVID-19 pandemic momentum: can it be used to support improvements in healthcare worker influenza vaccination,2021,"Bovine coronavirus (BoCV) is an important pathogen of cattle, causing severe enteric disease and playing a role in the bovine respiratory disease complex. Similar to other coronaviruses, a remarkable variability characterizes both its genome and biology. Despite their potential relevance, different aspects of the evolution of BoCV remain elusive. The present study reconstructs the history and evolution of BoCV using a phylodynamic approach based on complete genome and spike protein sequences. The results demonstrate high mutation and recombination rates affecting different parts of the viral genome. In the spike gene, this variability undergoes significant selective pressures-particularly episodic pressure-located mainly on the protein surface, suggesting an immune-induced selective pressure. The occurrence of compensatory mutations was also identified. On the contrary, no strong evidence in favor of host and/or tissue tropism affecting viral evolution has been proven. The well-known plasticity is thus ascribable to the innate broad viral tropism rather than mid- or long-term adaptation. The evaluation of the geographic spreading pattern clearly evidenced two clusters: a European cluster and an American-Asian cluster. While a relatively dense and quick migration network was identified in the former, the latter was dominated by the primary role of the United States (US) as a viral exportation source. Since the viral spreading pattern strongly mirrored the cattle trade, the need for more intense monitoring and preventive measures cannot be underestimated as well as the need to enforce the vaccination of young animals before international trade, to reduce not only the clinical impact but also the transferal and mixing of BoCV strains.","Franzo, Giovanni; Drigo, Michele; Legnardi, Matteo; Grassi, Laura; Pasotto, Daniela; Menandro, Maria Luisa; Cecchinato, Mattia; Tucciarone, Claudia Maria",Viruses,,597

An ONP sample was obtained following bilateral conjunctiva swabs in 85 subjects with a contact history or symptoms but unknown SARS-CoV-2 status and with no ocular symptoms or findings. The results were evaluated according to the patient's symptoms and how the swab was taken. The conjunctiva swab was positive in 29 (34.1%) cases and the ONP swab in 20 (23.5%) cases. Both methods produced positive results in 11 (14.1%) cases. The mean cycle threshold (Ct ) value was 30.15 ± 3.41 in symptomatic cases and 33.62 ± 1.76 in asymptomatic cases (p = .008). The mean Ct value was 24.37 ± 3.48 when only the ONP swab was positive and 31.22 ± 1.99 when only the conjunctiva swab was positive. In cases that were positive by both methods, the mean Ct value was 25.21 ± 4.94 for the ONP swab and 30.29 ± 5.05 for the conjunctiva swab. We found higher SARS-CoV-2 detection rates with the conjunctiva swab than the ONP swab in cases with unknown SARS-CoV-2 status in the early period. In addition, the conjunctival viral load seemed to be higher in symptomatic cases than in asymptomatic cases. We, therefore, believe a conjunctiva swab could be an alternative method to detect SARS-CoV-2 at the time of the first presentation to the outpatient department.","Gunduz, Ayten; Firat, Murat; Turkoglu, Gamze",J Med Virol,,597

The change in lung texture encountered by practitioners handling severe COVID-19 cases is caused by a potentially lethal presentation of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), in which ""breathing becomes impossible without a ventilator. Ventilators are not curative, but they are essential in some cases: they keep the body alive while it fights infection. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) endorses innovative solutions, often devised by nurses tinkering with old machine parts. While adapting simple machines is preferable to using a pseudo-ethical algorithm to ration available ventilators, it is a risky endeavor. Provisional devices--like those that siphon air into multiple tubes to service two patients at once--and emergency triage techniques, are suboptimal fixes employed against a lifethreatening ventilator shortage.","Trabucco, Caroline M.",Administrative Law Review,,597

Therefore, a number of studies have already been, or are now being, conducted on the detrimental effects of the virus. In this respect, a question may arise: Is there any possibility to turn the threat of the virus outbreak into an opportunity in some sectors such as the banking industry? In this research, the effects of COVID-19 outbreak as an intervening element on the acceptance of branchless banking were studied.Design/methodology/approachIn this research, the factors affecting the acceptance and development of branchless banking in Iran at the time of COVID-19 outbreak were identified by systematically studying the theoretical framework, conducting further research and interviewing the experts;then, a causal loop diagram of the problem in the proposed case study and the flow rate model were presented.FindingsThe simulation results showed that banking transactions and a bank's financial resources would increase by implementing the package policy of reducing the number of branches, promoting incentive policies and increasing the budget rate of the bank in Information Technology (IT). Further, by promoting customers' acceptance of new technologies, the spread of COVID-19 can be viewed as a positive factor, or even a catalyst, in the acceptance and development of branchless banking in Iran.Originality/valueBased on the proposed model, the difficulties faced by individuals during the spread of COVID-19 could act as justifiable incentives to boost appropriate organizational preparations for making changes to the classic working processes.

The practice of wearing a mask, which requires change in people's usual behavior, may reduce disease transmission by preventing the virus spread from infectious to susceptible individuals. Wearing a mask may result in a public good game structure, where an individual does not want to wear a mask but desires that others wear it. This study develops and analyzes a new intervention game model that combines the mathematical models of epidemiology with evolutionary game theory. This approach quantifies how people use mask-wearing and related protecting behaviors that directly benefit the wearer and bring some advantage to other people during an epidemic. At each time-step, a suspected susceptible individual decides whether to wear a facemask, or not, due to a social learning process that accounts for the risk of infection and mask cost. Numerical results reveal a diverse and rich social dilemma structure that is hidden behind this mask-wearing dilemma. Our results highlight the sociological dimension of mask-wearing policy.","Kabir, K M Ariful; Risa, Tori; Tanimoto, Jun",Sci Rep,,597

371882,"Response to ""Tomographic Findings and Thrombogenic Effects of COVID-19""",2020,"In this article, we present a novel method for line artifacts quantification in lung ultrasound (LUS) images of COVID-19 patients. We formulate this as a nonconvex regularization problem involving a sparsity-enforcing, Cauchy-based penalty function, and the inverse Radon transform. We employ a simple local maxima detection technique in the Radon transform domain, associated with known clinical definitions of line artifacts. Despite being nonconvex, the proposed technique is guaranteed to convergence through our proposed Cauchy proximal splitting (CPS) method, and accurately identifies both horizontal and vertical line artifacts in LUS images. To reduce the number of false and missed detection, our method includes a two-stage validation mechanism, which is performed in both Radon and image domains. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method in comparison to the current state-of-the-art B-line identification method, and show a considerable performance gain with 87% correctly detected B-lines in LUS images of nine COVID-19 patients.","Karakus, Oktay; Anantrasirichai, Nantheera; Aguersif, Amazigh; Silva, Stein; Basarab, Adrian; Achim, Alin",IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control,,597

The SAgovernment announced a countrywide lockdown from midnight 26 March 2020 to midnight 30 April 2020 to stem the pandemic and save lives. However, many questions remain on how the COVID-19 threat will unfold in SA, given the significant informal sector overcrowding and poverty in our communities. There is no doubt that leadership and teamwork at all levels is critical in influencing outcomes.","Parker, A; Karamchand, S; Schrueder, N; Lahri, S; Rabie, H; Aucamp, A; Abrahams, R; Ciapparelli, P; Erasmus, D S; Cotton, M F; Lalla, U; Leisegang, R; Meintjes, J; Mistry, R; Moosa, M R; Mowlana, A; Koegelenberg, C F N; Prozesky, H; Smith, W; Van Schalkwyk, M; Taljaard, J J",S Afr Med J,,597
372296,The thromboembolism in COVID-19: the unsolved problem,2020,"While most countries imposed a lockdown in response to the first wave of COVID-19 infections, Sweden did not. To quantify the lockdown effect, we approximate a counterfactual lockdown scenario for Sweden through the outcome in a synthetic control unit. We find, first, that a 9-week lockdown in the first half of 2020 would have reduced infections and deaths by about 75% and 38%, respectively. Second, the lockdown effect starts to materialize with a delay of 3-4 weeks only. Third, the actual adjustment of mobility patterns in Sweden suggests there has been substantial voluntary social restraint, although the adjustment was less strong than under the lockdown scenario. Lastly, we find that a lockdown would not have caused much additional output loss.","Born, Benjamin; Dietrich, Alexander M; Müller, Gernot J",PLoS One,,597
372376,Teledentistry support in COVID-19 oral care,2020,"The search for therapeutic drugs that can neutralize the effects of COVID-2019 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is the main focus of current research. The coronavirus main protease (Mpro) is an attractive target for anti-coronavirus drug design. Further, &#945;-ketoamide is proved to be very effective as a reversible covalent-inhibitor against cysteine proteases. Herein, we report on the non-covalent to the covalent adduct formation mechanism of &#945;-ketoamide-based inhibitor with the enzyme active site amino acids by QM/SQM model (QM = quantum mechanical, SQM = semi-empirical QM). To uncover the mechanism, we focused on two approaches: a concerted and a stepwise fashion. The concerted pathway proceeds via deprotonation of the thiol of cysteine (here, Cys145 SÎ³H) and simultaneous reversible nucleophilic attack of sulfur onto the &#945;-ketoamide warhead. In this work, we propose three plausible concerted pathways. On the contrary, in a traditional two-stage pathway, the first step is proton transfer from Cys145 SÎ³H to His41 NÎ´ forming an ion pair, and consecutively, in the second step, the thiolate ion attacks the &#945;-keto group to form a thiohemiketal. In this reaction, we find that the stability of the tetrahedral intermediate oxyanion/hydroxyl group plays an important role. Moreover, as the &#945;-keto group has two faces Si or Re for the nucleophilic attack, we considered both possibilities of attack leading to S- and R-thiohemiketal. We computed the structural, electronic, and energetic parameters of all stationary points including transition states via ONIOM and pure DFT method. Additionally, to characterize covalent, weak noncovalent interaction (NCI) and hydrogen-bonds, we applied NCI-reduced density gradient (NCI-RDG) methods along with Bader's Quantum Theory of Atoms-in-Molecules (QTAIM) and natural bonding orbital (NBO) analysis.","Banerjee, Snehasis",Biophys Chem,,597

In light of this worrisome scenario, this opinion review aimed to discuss the current knowledge about the potential role of curcumin and its nanostructured systems on the SARS-CoV-2 targets. From this perspective, this work demonstrated that curcumin urges as a potential antiviral key for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 based on its relation to the infection pathways. Moreover, the use of curcumin-loaded nanocarriers for increasing its bioavailability and therapeutic efficiency was highlighted. Additionally, the potential of the nanostructured systems by themselves and their synergic action with curcumin on molecular targets for viral infections have been explored. Finally, a viewpoint of the studies that need to be carried out to implant curcumin as a treatment for COVID-19 was addressed.","Dourado, Douglas; Freire, Danielle T; Pereira, Daniel T; Amaral-Machado, Lucas; N Alencar, Éverton; de Barros, André Luís Branco; Egito, E Sócrates T",Biomed Pharmacother,,597

373750,Broader trauma: Considerations for COVID-19 psychosocial interventions in Hong Kong,2020,"The current outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected people around the world. Typically, COVID-19 originates in the lung, but lately it can extend to other organs and lead to tissue injury and multiorgan failure in severe patients, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), kidney failure and sepsis or systemic inflammation. Given that COVID-19 has been detected in a range of other organs, the COVID-19-associated disease is an alert of aberrant activation of host immune response which drives un-controlled inflammation that affects multiple organs. Complement is a vital component of innate immunity where it forms the first line of defense against potentially harmful microbes, but its role in COVID-19 is still not clear. Notably, the abnormal activation and continuous deposits of complement components were identified in the pre-clinical samples from COVID-19 patients, which have been confirmed in animal models. Recent evidence has revealed that the administration of complement inhibitors leads to relieve inflammatory response in ARDS. Hence, we speculate that the targeting complement system could be a potential treatment option for organ damage in COVID-19 patients.","Li, Qin; Chen, Zi",Med Microbiol Immunol,,597

This raises concerns about how to achieve a shared decision-making process that prepares patients to make an informed decision about their choices about prenatal genetic screening and testing options, calling for a reconsideration of how healthcare providers approach the first prenatal visit. METHODS: We conducted interviews with 40 pregnant women to identify components of decision-making regarding prenatal genetic screens and tests at this visit. Analysis was approached using grounded theory. RESULTS: Participants brought distinct notions of risk to the visit, including skewed perceptions of baseline risk for a fetal genetic condition and the implications of screening and testing. Participants were very concerned about financial considerations associated with these options, ranking out-of-pocket costs on par with medical considerations. Participants noted diverging priorities at the first visit from those of their healthcare provider, leading to barriers to shared decision-making regarding screening and testing during this visit. CONCLUSION: Research is needed to determine how to restructure the initiation of prenatal care in a way that best positions patients to make informed decisions about prenatal genetic screens and tests.","Farrell, Ruth M; Pierce, Madelyn; Collart, Christina; Edmonds, Brownsyne Tucker; Chien, Edward; Coleridge, Marissa; Rose, Susannah L; Perni, Uma; Frankel, Richard",Prenat. diagn,,597

374214,Cardiovascular Imaging in Patients with COVID-19,2020,"MHC class II (MHC II) displays peptides at the cell surface, a process critical for CD4+ T cell development and priming. Ubiquitination is a mechanism that dictates surface MHC II with the attachment of a polyubiquitin chain to peptide-loaded MHC II, promoting its traffic away from the plasma membrane. In this study, we have examined how MHC II ubiquitination impacts the composition and function of both conventional CD4+ T cell and regulatory T cell (Treg) compartments. Responses were examined in two models of altered MHC II ubiquitination: MHCIIKRKI /KI mice that express a mutant MHC II unable to be ubiquitinated or mice that lack membrane-associated RING-CH 8 (MARCH8), the E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for MHC II ubiquitination specifically in thymic epithelial cells. Conventional CD4+ T cell populations in thymus, blood, and spleen of MHCIIKRKI/KI and March8 -/- mice were largely unaltered. In MLRs, March8 -/-, but not MHCIIKRKI/KI, CD4+ T cells had reduced reactivity to both self- and allogeneic MHC II. Thymic Treg were significantly reduced in MHCIIKRKI/KI mice, but not March8 -/- mice, whereas splenic Treg were unaffected. Neither scenario provoked autoimmunity, with no evidence of immunohistopathology and normal levels of autoantibody. In summary, MHC II ubiquitination in specific APC types does not have a major impact on the conventional CD4+ T cell compartment but is important for Treg development.","Liu, Haiyin; Wilson, Kayla R; Schriek, Patrick; Macri, Christophe; Blum, Annabelle B; Francis, Lauren; Heinlein, Melanie; Nataraja, Champa; Harris, James; Jones, Sarah A; Gray, Daniel H D; Villadangos, Jose A; Mintern, Justine D",J. immunol,,597

Here we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with rheumatic diseases. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus and preprint database up to 29th August 2020, for publications with confirmed COVID-19 infection in patients with rheumatic diseases. The primary outcomes were the rates of hospitalization, oxygen support, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death. A meta-analysis of effect sizes using the random-effects models was performed, and meta-regression analyses were performed to explore heterogeneity. The data from the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance physician registry (the COVID-19 GRA) was used as a reference. RESULTS: A total of 31 articles involving 1138 patients were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The publications were from Europe, Asia and North America, but none from other continents. The overall rates of hospitalization, oxygen support, ICU admission and fatality among COVID-19 infected patients with rheumatic diseases were 0.58 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.48-0.67), 0.33 (95% CI 0.21-0.47), 0.09 (95% CI 0.05-0.15) and 0.07 (95% CI 0.03-0.11), respectively. The rate of oxygen support in Europe (0.48, 95% CI 0.4-0.57) was higher than that in other continents. Among all hospitalized patients, the rates of oxygen support, ICU admission and fatality were 0.61 (95% CI 0.48-0.73), 0.13 (95% CI 0.07-0.21) and 0.13 (95% CI 0.09-0.18), respectively. The fatality rate was highest in Europe (0.19, 95% CI 0.15-0.24). The fatality rate was higher both in this meta-analysis and the COVID-19 GRA (7.0% and 6.7%, respectively) than that (3.4%) in WHO database, although the age, gender and comorbidity were not matched. CONCLUSION: Patients with rheumatic diseases remain vulnerable with substantial rates of severe outcomes and a geographic variation.

Little is known about the effects of increased mask-wearing on social interactions, social anxiety, or overall mental health. OBJECTIVES: Explore the potential effects of mask-wearing on social anxiety. DESIGN: We review existing literatures to highlight three preselected sets of factors that may be important in shaping the effects of mask-wearing on social anxiety. These are: (a) people's perceptions of the social norms associated with wearing masks; (b) people's experiences of the degree to which masks prevent accurate interpretation of social and emotional cues; and (c) people's use of masks as a type of safety behavior that enables self-concealment. METHODS: APA PsycNet and PubMed were searched principally between September and November 2020 for articles describing the relationship between social anxiety, intolerance of uncertainty, ambiguous feedback, and safety behavior use and for research on the relationship between mask-wearing and social norms and social interactions.

The level of awareness and knowledge of the disease as well as the related attitude and practice amongst hospital workers could determine its extent of control. The aim of this study was to determine the knowledge, attitude and practices amongst hospital staff regarding COVID-19. Methods: this cross-sectional study was conducted among staff of the Niger Delta University Teaching Hospital, Bayelsa State, Nigeria. A self-administered semi-structured questionnaire was adapted in assessing their knowledge, attitude and practice towards COVID-19. Results: one hundred and twenty four respondents completed the study with a mean age of 30.9 ± 6.5 years. Up to 90% of them demonstrated good knowledge of COVID-19 with regard to preventive and control measures. Approximately 90% of them practiced good hand hygiene though a lesser proportion wore face masks (51.6%) and practiced crowd avoidance (58.1%).

OBJECTIVE: We examine the COVID-19-related healthcare utilization and mortality by race and ethnicity of patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study. SETTING: We used the VHA COVID-19 shared data resources between February 1 and June 30, 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Veterans tested for SARS-CoV-2 virus by VHA. EXPOSURE(S): Three racial-ethnicity groups of Black, Hispanic, and White (as reference) veterans. MAIN OUTCOME(S) AND MEASURE(S): Main outcomes are testing rate, positivity rate, hospitalization rate, ICU admission rate, and in-hospital mortality. Controlling for sex, age, and Elixhauser comorbidity index, we report adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) from logistic regression models. RESULTS: Of the 8,667,996 active veteran enrollees, 252,702 were tested by VHA from February to June, 2020, with 20,500 positive results and 4,790 hospitalizations. The testing rate was 4.4% among Black and 4.7% among Hispanic veterans compared to White veterans, 2.8%. The testing positivity rate was similarly elevated among Black (12.2%) and Hispanic (11.6%) veterans compared to White veterans (6.0%). The aORs of hospitalization in Black veterans (1.88; 95% CI 1.74, 2.03) and Hispanic veterans (1.41; 95% CI 1.25, 1.60) were higher compared to White veterans. No significant differences by race and ethnicity were observed in OR or aOR of ICU admission and in-hospital death among hospitalized patients. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: On a national level, the VHA was more likely to test and hospitalize Black and Hispanic veterans compared to White veterans, but there were no significant differences in ICU admission or in-hospital mortality among those hospitalized. This pattern of differences may relate to social determinants of health, factors affecting access to non-VHA care, or preferences for VHA care affecting initial care seeking, but not in-hospital outcomes.","Razjouyan, Javad; Helmer, Drew A; Li, Ang; Naik, Aanand D; Amos, Christopher I; Bandi, Venkata; Sharafkhaneh, Amir",J. racial ethnic health disparities (Internet),,597

This is achieved through a dedicated WebGIS platform, particularly handy in communicating geoscience during the COVID-19 era. For this application, we selected nine volcanic outcrops in Santorini, Greece. The latter are mainly associated with several geological processes (e.g., dyking, explosive, and effusive eruptions). In particular, they have been associated with the famous Late Bronze Age (LBA) eruption, which made them ideal for geoheritage popularization objectives since they combine scientific and educational purposes with geotourism applications. Initially, we transformed these stunning volcanological outcrops into geospatial models—the so called virtual outcrops (VOs) here defined as virtual geosites (VGs)—through UAV-based photogrammetry and 3D modeling. In the next step, we uploaded them on an online platform that is fully accessible for Earth science teaching and communication. The nine VGs are currently accessible on a PC, a smartphone, or a tablet. Each one includes a detailed description and plenty of annotations available for the viewers during 3D exploration.

Impact of Covid-19 on Therapy Provision for Children with Cns Tumours,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic requires to conscientiously weigh ""timely surgical intervention"" for colorectal cancer against efforts to conserve hospital resources and protect patients and health care providers. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Professional societies provided ad-hoc guidance at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic on deferral of surgical and perioperative interventions, but these lack specific parameters to determine the optimal timing of surgery. METHODS: Using the GRADE system, published evidence was analyzed to generate weighted statements for stage, site, acuity of presentation, and hospital setting to specify when surgery should be pursued, the time and duration of oncologically acceptable delays, and when to utilize nonsurgical modalities to bridge the waiting period. RESULTS: Colorectal cancer surgeries-prioritized as emergency, urgent with imminent emergency or oncologically urgent, or elective-were matched against the phases of the pandemic. Surgery in COVID-19-positive patients must be avoided. Emergent and imminent emergent cases should mostly proceed unless resources are exhausted. Standard practices allow for postponement of elective cases and deferral to nonsurgical modalities of stage II/III rectal and metastatic colorectal cancer. Oncologically urgent cases may be delayed for 6(-12) weeks without jeopardizing oncological outcomes. Outside established principles, administration of nonsurgical modalities is not justified and increases the vulnerability of patients. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has stressed already limited health care resources and forced rationing, triage, and prioritization of care in general, specifically of surgical interventions. Established guidelines allow for modifications of optimal timing and type of surgery for colorectal cancer during an unrelated pandemic.","O039,; Leary, Michael P; Choong, Kevin C; Thornblade, Lucas W; Fakih, Marwan G; Fong, Yuman; Kaiser, Andreas M",Ann Surg,,597
376597,The Early Effect of COVID-19 Restrictions on an Academic Orthopedic Surgery Department,2020,"There is growing evidence on the effect of face mask use in controlling the spread of COVID-19. However, few studies have examined the effect of local face mask policies on the pandemic. In this study, we developed a dynamic compartmental model of COVID-19 transmission in New York City (NYC), which was the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA. We used data on daily and cumulative COVID-19 infections and deaths from the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to calibrate and validate our model. We then used the model to assess the effect of the executive order on face mask use on infections and deaths due to COVID-19 in NYC. Our results showed that the executive order on face mask use was estimated to avert 99,517 (95% CIs 72,723-126,312) COVID-19 infections and 7978 (5692-10,265) deaths in NYC. If the executive order was implemented 1 week earlier (on April 10), the averted infections and deaths would be 111,475 (81,593-141,356) and 9017 (6446-11,589), respectively. If the executive order was implemented 2 weeks earlier (on April 3 when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended face mask use), the averted infections and deaths would be 128,598 (94,373-162,824) and 10,515 (7540-13,489), respectively. Our study provides public health practitioners and policymakers with evidence on the importance of implementing face mask policies in local areas as early as possible to control the spread of COVID-19 and reduce mortality.","Shen, Mingwang; Zu, Jian; Fairley, Christopher K; Pagán, José A; Ferket, Bart; Liu, Bian; Yi, Stella S; Chambers, Earle; Li, Guoqiang; Guo, Yuming; Rong, Libin; Xiao, Yanni; Zhuang, Guihua; Zebrowski, Alexis; Carr, Brendan G; Li, Yan; Zhang, Lei",J Urban Health,,597

Especially for college students, as a group of external conditions supporting and having a strong sense of autonomy, online learning habits will have a lasting impact on subsequent learning production, and even become the second important knowledge acquisition way besides classroom. Therefore, it is necessary to study the use of online learning platform and self-directed learning behavior of college students. Based on TAM and UTAUT, this study supplements the perception theory and self-directed learning theory by extracting the influence factors of live platform. Based on the data analysis of smartpls and SPSS, this paper constructs the structural equation model of self-learning behavior of College Students’ online learning platform, explores the external and internal influence mechanism of self-learning behavior, and provides guidance for online learning platform practitioners and college students’ self-learning behavior.","Zhang, Lulu Tian Yue Song Shibo",Journal of Physics: Conference Series,,597

At the same time, like the intestinal microbiota, it is involved in modulating the immune response to infectious agents in the host organism. A causal relationship between the composition of the respiratory microbiota and the likelihood of development and the severity of COVID-19 may be hypothesized. We analyze biomaterial from nasopharyngeal smears from 336 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, selected during the first and second waves of the epidemic in Russia. Sequences from a similar study conducted in Spain were also included in the analysis. We investigated associations between disease severity and microbiota at the level of microbial community (community types) and individual microbes (differentially represented species). To search for associations, we performed multivariate analysis, taking into account comorbidities, type of community and lineage of the virus. We found that two out of six community types are associated with a more severe course of the disease, and one of the community types is characterized by high stability (very similar microbiota profiles in different patients) and low level of lung damage. Differential abundance analysis with respect to comorbidities and community type suggested association of Rothia and Streptococcus genera representatives with more severe lung damage, and Leptotrichia, unclassified Lachnospiraceae and Prevotella with milder forms of the disease.","Babenko, Vladislav Viktorovich; Bakhtyev, Ramiz Romanovich; Baklaushev, Vladimir Pavlovich; Balykova, Larisa Alexandrovna; Bashkirov, Pavel Viktorovich; Bespyatykh, Julia Andreevna; Blagonravova, Anna Sergeevna; Boldyreva, Daria Igorevna; Fedorov, Dmitry Evgenievich; Gafurov, Ilshat Rafkatovich; Gaifullina, Raushaniya Faritovna; Galeeva, Julia Sergeevna; Galova, Elena Anatolyevna; Gospodaryk, Alina Vladimirovna; Ilina, Elena Nikolaevna; Ivanov, Konstantin Pavlovich; Kharlampieva, Daria Dmitrievna; Khromova, Polina Andreevna; Klimina, Ksenia Mikhailovna; Kolontarev, Konstantin Borisovich; Kolyshkina, Nadezhda Aleksandrovna; Koritsky, Andrey Vladimirovich; Kuropatkin, Vyacheslav Alexandrovich; Lazarev, Vasily Nikolaevich; Manolov, Alexander Ivanovich; Manuvera, Valentin Alexandrovich; Matyushkina, Daria Sergeevna; Morozov, Maxim Denisovich; Moskaleva, Ekaterina Vladimirovna; Musarova, Varvara Alexandrovna; Ogarkov, Oleg Borisovich; Orlova, Elizaveta Andreevna; Pavlenko, Alexander Vladimirovich; Petrova, Alla Germanovna; Pozhenko, Natalia Sergeevna; Pushkar, Dmitry Yurievich; Rumyantsev, Alexander Grigorievich; Rumyantsev, Sergey Aleksandrovich; Rumyantsev, Vladimir Alexandrovich; Rychkova, Lyubov Vladimirovna; Samoilov, Alexander Sergeevich; Shirokova, Irina Yurievna; Sinkov, Vyacheslav Vladimirovich; Solovieva, Svetlana Vladimirovna; Starikova, Elizaveta Valentinovna; Tikhonova, Polina Olegovna; Trifonova, Galina Sergeevna; Troitsky, Alexander Vitalievich; Tulichev, Alexander Alekseevich; Udalov, Yuri Dmitrievich; Varizhuk, Anna Mikhailovna; Vasiliev, Alexander Olegovich; Vereshchagin, Rinat Irekovich; Veselovsky, Vladimir Alexandrovich; Volnukhin, Alexey Igorevich; Yusubalieva, Gaukhar Maratovna; Govorun, Vadim Markovich",,,597

There are no efficient treatments for COVID-19. Therefore, it is essential to investigate new therapies for this problem. Due to specific mechanism for inhibition of microbial growth, antimicrobial peptides can be considered as one of the best therapies in this field. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are important agents that are made by the immune system in response to pathogens. This kind of immune response exists in all animal categories from prokaryotes to humans. Different types of AMPs have been identified and isolated from various organisms from bacteria to humans. So far, 190 antiviral peptides with antiviral effects have been extracted and introduced from various animal sources. These natural compounds and their derivatives, e.g. synthetic peptides, can be considered as new therapeutic goals in COVID-19. In this review, we assessed these peptides in different animal categories as well as synthetic peptides and the possibility of using these compounds in the treatment of COVID-19.","Zare-Zardini, H.; Ferdosian, F.; Soltaninejad, H.; Zahedi, M.; Memarpoor-Yazdi, M.; Hamidieh, A.

COVID-19 is affecting everyone in the globe and mask wearing is one of the few precautions against it. To quantify people's perception of mask effectiveness and to prevent the spread of COVID-19 for small areas, we use Understanding America Study's (UAS) survey data on COVID-19 as our primary data source. Our data analysis shows that direct survey-weighted estimates for small areas could be highly unreliable. In this paper we develop a synthetic estimation method to estimate proportions of mask effectiveness for small areas using a logistic model that combines information from multiple data sources. We select our working model using an extensive data analysis facilitated by a new variable selection criterion for survey data and benchmarking ratios. We propose a Jackknife method to estimate variance of our proposed estimator. From our data analysis. it is evident that our proposed synthetic method outperforms direct survey-weighted estimator with respect to commonly used evaluation measures.","Sen, A.; Lahiri, P.",,,597

Methods: Mathematical functions are employed to describe the number of cases and demises in each region and to predict their final numbers, as well as the dates of maximum daily occurrences and the local stabilization date. The model parameters are calibrated using a computational methodology for numerical optimization. Trend analyses are run, allowing to assess the effects of public policies. Easy to interpret metrics over the quality of the fitted curves are provided. Country-wise data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) concerning the daily number of cases and demises around the world are used, as well as detailed data from Johns Hopkins University and from the Brasil.io project describing individually the occurrences in United States counties and in Brazilian states and cities, respectively. U. S. and Brazil were chosen for a more detailed analysis because they are the current foci of the pandemic. Results: Illustrative results for different countries, U. S. counties and Brazilian states and cities are presented and discussed. Conclusion: The main contributions of this work lie in (i) a straightforward model of the curves to represent the data, which allows automation of the process without requiring interventions from experts; (ii) an innovative approach for trend analysis, whose results provide important information to support authorities in their decision-making process; and (iii) the developed computational tool, which is freely available and allows the user to quickly update the COVID-19 analyses and forecasts for any country, United States county or Brazilian state or city present in the periodic reports from the authorities.","Paiva, Henrique Mohallem; Afonso, Rubens Junqueira Magalhaes; Caldeira, Fabiana Mara Scarpelli de Lima Alvarenga; Velasquez, Ester de Andrade",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.10332v1.pdf,597

378813,Incidence of COVID-19 recurrence among large cohort of healthcare employees,2021,"Globalization has altered the way we live our lives and earn a livelihood. Consequently, trade and travel have been recognized as significant determinants of the spread of disease. Additionally, rise in urbanization and the closer integration of the world economy has facilitated global interconnectedness. Therefore, globalization has emerged as an essential mechanism of disease transmission. This paper aims to examine the potential impacts of COVID-19 on globalization and global health in terms of mobility, trade, travel, and countries most impacted. The effect of globalization was operationalized in terms of mobility, economy, and healthcare systems. The mobility of individuals and its magnitude was assessed using airline and seaport trade data and travel information. The economic impact was measured based on the workforce, event cancellations, food and agriculture, academic institutions, and supply chain. The healthcare capacity was assessed by consideration of healthcare systems indicators and preparedness of countries. Utilizing a technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) we calculated a pandemic vulnerability index (PVI) creating a quantitative measure of the potential global health. The pandemic has placed an unprecedented burden on the world's economy, healthcare, and globalization through the travel, events cancellation, employment workforce, food chain, academia, and healthcare capacity. Based on PVI results, certain countries are more vulnerable than others. In Africa, more vulnerable countries include South Africa and Egypt; in Europe, they are Russia, Germany, and Italy; in Asia and Oceania, they are India, Iran, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey; and for the Americas, they are Brazil, USA, Chile, Mexico, and Peru. The impact on mobility, economy, and healthcare systems has only started to manifest. The findings of this study may help in the planning and implementation of strategies at the country level to help ease this emerging burden.","Shrestha, Nistha; Shad, Muhammad Yousaf; Ulvi, Osman; Khan, Modasser Hossain; Karamehic-Muratovic, Ajlina; Nguyen, Uyen-Sa D T; Baghbanzadeh, Mahdi; Wardrup, Robert; Aghamohammadi, Nasrin; Cervantes, Diana; Nahiduzzaman, Kh Md; Zaki, Rafdzah Ahmed; Haque, Ubydul",One Health,,597

In view of that, this phenomenographic design study sought to investigate and document the qualitatively different perspectives of thirteen students with visual impairments (SWVIs) as they transitioned and studied fully in an online space. The experiences of the SWVIs were captured in five themes that emerged from the analysis of the field data. The five themes are pre-COVID-19 academic experiences, [initial] reaction to online shift, preparation towards online shift, coping mechanisms in fully online learning spaces and preferred post-COVID-19 learning space. In the end, the SWVIs expressed more challenges with online learning than benefits and opted for a switch to the face-to-face mode post-COVID-19.

Although mobile phone locations provide some information about community-level activity, dense distributed geophysical sensing of ground motions across a city are more complete and also natively anonymous. In this paper, we demonstrate how fiber-optic Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) connected to a telecommunication cable beneath Palo Alto, CA captured seismic and geodetic signals produced by vehicles during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak and subsequent quarantine. We utilize DAS strain measurements of roadbed deformation caused by local cars and trucks in an automatic template matching detection algorithm to count the number of vehicles traveling per day over a two-month period around the timing of the San Francisco Bay Area shelter-in-place order. Using a segment of the optical fiber near a major grocery store on Sand Hill Road we find a 50% decrease in vehicle count immediately following the order, but data from near Stanford Hospital showed a far more subtle change due to on-going hospital activities. We compare the information derived from DAS measurements to other quarantine response metrics and find a strong correlation with the relative changes reported by Google and Apple using mobile phone data.","Lindsey, Nathaniel J.; Yuan, Siyuan; Lellouch, Ariel; Gualtieri, Lucia; Lecocq, Thomas; Biondi, Biondo",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.04861v1.pdf,597

383313,Functioning During a Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Antiviral medications are being given empirically to some patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To support the development of a COVID-19 management guideline, we conducted a systematic review that addressed the benefits and harms of 7 antiviral treatments for COVID-19. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed and 3 Chinese databases (CNKI, WANFANG and SinoMed) through Apr. 19, medRxiv and Chinaxiv through Apr. 27, and Chongqing VIP through Apr. 30, 2020. We included studies of ribavirin, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, umifenovir (arbidol), favipravir, interferon and lopinavir/ritonavir. If direct evidence from COVID-19 studies was not available, we included indirect evidence from studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) for efficacy outcomes and other acute respiratory viral infections for safety outcomes. RESULTS: In patients with nonsevere COVID-19 illness, the death rate was extremely low, precluding an important effect on mortality. We found only very low-quality evidence with little or no suggestion of benefit for most treatments and outcomes in both nonsevere and severe COVID-19. An exception was treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir, for which we found low-quality evidence for a decrease in length of stay in the intensive care unit (risk difference 5 d shorter, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0 to 9 d) and hospital stay (risk difference 1 d shorter, 95% CI 0 to 2 d). For safety outcomes, evidence was of low or very low quality, with the exception of treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir for which moderate-quality evidence suggested likely increases in diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. INTERPRETATION: To date, persuasive evidence of important benefit in COVID-19 does not exist for any antiviral treatments, although for each treatment evidence has not excluded important benefit. Additional randomized controlled trials involving patients with COVID-19 will be needed before such treatments can be administered with confidence.","Liu, Wei; Zhou, Pengxiang; Chen, Ken; Ye, Zhikang; Liu, Fang; Li, Xiaotong; He, Na; Wu, Ziyang; Zhang, Qi; Gong, Xuepeng; Tang, Qiyu; Du, Xin; Ying, Yingqiu; Xu, Xiaohan; Zhang, Yahui; Liu, Jinyu; Li, Yun; Shen, Ning; Couban, Rachel J; Ibrahim, Quazi I; Guyatt, Gordon; Zhai, Suodi",CMAJ,,597
383409,Introducing a method for safe air evacuation from oxygenator in cardiac surgery operating rooms during COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Rationale: The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) as a predictor of outcomes has been studied in different disease states such as sepsis, ARDS and pancreatitis. In COVID-19 patients, NLR has been shown to be an independent risk factor associated with disease severity with a few studies suggesting an association between NLR and outcomes. Using data from a large multi-hospital healthcare system over a 6-month period, we sought to independently evaluate the NLR's ability to predict need for hospitalization, ICU admission, need for mechanical ventilation, 30-day mortality, and its association with hypoxemia. Methods: We collected demographic, historic and clinical data from patients with a naso-and/or oropharyngeal swab positive for SARS-CoV-2 PCR visiting the ED for COVID-19-related complaints between March-September 2020. Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) was calculated using 1 liter per minute (lpm) supplemental O2 to 3% FiO2 conversion and capped at 15 lpm O2. We examined the association of NLR with hypoxemia, need for hospitalization, ICU admission, need for mechanical ventilation within 7 days of ED visit and 30-day mortality after adjustment for history of hypertension, diabetes, severity of hypoxemia and age. Results: From 510 patients analyzed, 357 had a complete blood count (CBC) drawn (median age 57, 51% female). Median NLR was 2.09 with IQR of 3.69-5.88. NLR negatively correlated with degree of hypoxemia as quantified by SpO2-FiO2 (SF) ratio (Rho =-0.33, p &lt; 0.001). Patients requiring hospital admission had higher NLR compared to those who did not (median 2.59 IQR [4.45-7.6] vs 1.57 [2.75-4.36], p &lt; 0.001). In patients admitted to the hospital, NLR was higher in those requiring ICU admission compared to those who did not [2.99 [6.21-10.8] vs 2.37 [4.05-6.05], p &lt; 0.01]. In those with NLR above the median there was a trend towards higher need for intubation within 7 days, although this did not achieve statistical significance (OR 2.28, 95% CI 0.94-5.53, p = 0.07). 30-day mortality was higher in those with NLR above the median compared to those below the median (OR 2.84, 95% CI 1.29-6.28, p &lt; 0.01). Conclusions: In patients presenting to the ED with COVID-19, an increased NLR is associated with need for hospitalization, ICU admission and worse 30-day mortality while being inversely correlated with degree of hypoxemia. The cost-effectiveness and wide-spread availability of CBC testing makes NLR an easily implementable prognostication tool in COVID-19 patients.","Rivera, J.; Girard, C.; Kim, A.

Now people analyze the opinion of others before purchasing any product, hotel booking, stepping onto restaurants etc. and the respective user share their experience as a feedback towards the service. But there is no e-governance platform to obtain public opinion grievances towards covid19, government new laws, policies etc. With the growing availability and emergence of opinion rich information's, new opportunities and challenges might arise in developing a technology for mining the huge set of public messages, opinions and alert the respective departments to take necessary actions and also nearby ambulances if its related to covid-19. To overcome this pandemic situation a natural language processing based efficient e-governance platform is demandful to detect the corona positive patients and provide transparency on the covid count and also alert the respective health ministry and nearby ambulance based on the user voice inputs. To convert the public voice messages into text, we used Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). To identify respective government department responsible for the respective user voice input, we perform pre-processing, part of speech, unigram, bigram, trigram analysis and fuzzy logic (machine learning technique). After identifying the responsible department, we perform 2 methods, (1) Automatic alert e-mail and message to the government departmental officials and nearby ambulance or covid camp if the user input is related to covis19. (2) Ticketing system for public and government officials monitoring. For experimental results, we used Java based web and mobile application to execute the proposed methodology.

384227,Teleclerkships? The role of telemedicine in medical student education during COVID-19 and beyond,2021,"Background: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged from China in 2019 and rapidly spread worldwide. Patients with metabolic comorbid conditions are more susceptible to infection by COVID-19. Metabolic syndrome is a constellation of interlinked metabolic risk factors that predispose patients to increased risk of complications. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the aggressive form of NAFLD. Objective: The aim of this study is to determine the relationship between metabolic syndrome components and the risk of COVID-19. Methods: We reviewed data from a large commercial database (Explorys IBM) that aggregates electronic health records from 26 large nationwide healthcare systems. Using systemized nomenclature of clinical medical terms (SNOMED-CT), we identified adults with the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome and its individual components from 1999-2019. We included patients with the diagnosis of COVID-19 from December 2019 to May 2020. Comorbidities known to be associated with COVID-19 and metabolic syndrome such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, smoking, male gender, African American, and hypertension were collected. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to investigate whether metabolic syndrome or its individual components are independently associated with the risk of COVID-19. Results: Out of 61.4 million active adult patients in the database, 8,885 (0.01%) had documented COVID-19. The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was higher if metabolic syndrome was the primary diagnosis (0.10% vs 0.01% %, OR 7.00 [6.11-8.01]). The adjusted odds (aOR) of having COVID-19 was higher in patients if they were African Americans (OR 7.45 [7.14- 7.77]), hypertensive (aOR 2.53 [2.40 - 2.68]), obese (aOR 2.20 [2.10 2.32]), diabetic (aOR 1.41 [1.33- 1.48]) hyperlipidemic (OR 1.70 [1.56-1.74]) or diagnosed with NASH (OR 4.93 [4.05- 6.00]). There was a slight decrease in adjusted odds of having COVID-19 in males as compared to females (aOR 0.88 [0.84- 0.92]). Conclusion: The incidence of COVID-19 in patients with metabolic syndrome is high. Among all comorbid metabolic conditions, NASH had the strongest association with COVID-19.","Ghoneim, Sara; Butt, Muhammad Umer; Hamid, Osama; Shah, Aun; Asaad, Imad",Metabol Open,,597
385258,Screening for Sarcopenia (Physical Frailty) in the COVID-19 Era,2021,"BACKGROUND: The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 2021 Physician Fee Schedule (PFS) includes increases in office reimbursement but decreases in the valuation of total hip arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty and the conversion factor. The purpose of this study was to determine the financial impact of these changes on arthroplasty surgeons. METHODS: We queried data for 35 arthroplasty surgeons within our practice from 10/2019 to 10/2020 and captured all office and arthroplasty-related surgical procedure codes. We compared the difference in both work relative value units (RVUs) and Medicare reimbursement by surgeon based on the current 2020 PFS to the 2021 changes. We also estimated the impact of several proposals to include office increases to the global surgical package for each code. RESULTS: While the mean per surgeon RVU amount for primary arthroplasty procedures will decrease (6267 vs 6,088, P = .78), the mean office work RVU (2755 vs 3,220, P = .16) will increase in 2021. However, the reduction in surgical reimbursement ($530,076 in 2020 to $464,414 in 2021) far exceeds the gains from the office ($99,456 vs $107,374), leading to an overall decrease in reimbursement ($629,532 vs $571,788), a reduction of 9%. The passage of the coronavirus disease 2019 relief bill delays many of the PFS cuts and will result in an overall reduction in reimbursement of 2.4% ($629,532 vs $612,475, P = .61). CONCLUSION: Arthroplasty surgeons are projected to lose 2.4% of Medicare reimbursement in 2021 with the changes in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services PFS. Further study is needed to determine whether these cuts will limit access to care for Medicare patients.","Krueger, Chad A; Courtney, P Maxwell",J Arthroplasty,,597

Movements doubting the dangerousness or the existence of the virus have emerged and became a challenge to social cohesion. About 3487 individuals (434 Corona doubters and 3053 non-doubters) have participated in an online survey (predominat age group: 35-45 years). Particularly, COVID-19-related anxiety, generalized anxiety (Generalizied Anxiety Disorder Screener, GAD-7), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-2) and functional/adherent safety behaviour were assessed. COVID-19 doubters describe less functional safety behaviour. Fear of the virus is evident, similar to non-doubters. Generalized anxiety and depression were significantly higher in doubters. Repression and denial as psychological defence mechanisms could be the unconscious psychological strategy for coping with the distress variables. The results point out that public strategies may only be successful in managing opinions and beliefs if they address fears and worries.","Teufel, Martin; Schweda, Adam; Kohler, Hannah; Musche, Venja; Fink, Madeleine; Weismüller, Benjamin; Moradian, Sheila; Skoda, Eva-Maria; Bäuerle, Alexander",J. public health (Oxf),,597

The World Health Organization (WHO) has named the disease caused by the virus as COVID-19 and the virus which is the culprit was renamed from the initial novel respiratory 2019 coronavirus to SARS-CoV-2. The person-to-person transmission of this virus is ongoing despite drastic public health mitigation measures such as social distancing and movement restrictions implemented in most countries. Understanding the source of such an infectious pathogen is crucial to develop a means of avoiding transmission and further to develop therapeutic drugs and vaccines. To identify the etiological source of a novel human pathogen is a dynamic process that needs comprehensive and extensive scientific validations, such as observed in the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) cases. In this context, this review is devoted to understanding the taxonomic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and HIV. Herein, we discuss the emergence and molecular mechanisms of both viral infections. Nevertheless, no vaccine or therapeutic drug is yet to be approved for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2, although it is highly likely that new effective medications that target the virus specifically will take years to establish. Therefore, this review reflects the latest repurpose of existing antiviral therapeutic drug choices available to combat SARS-CoV-2.","Saleemi, Mansab Ali; Ahmad, Bilal; Benchoula, Khaled; Vohra, Muhammad Sufyan; Mea, Hing Jian; Chong, Pei Pei; Palanisamy, Navindra Kumari; Wong, Eng Hwa",Infect Genet Evol,,597
385973,Postintubation Dysphagia During COVID-19 Outbreak-Contemporary Review,2020,"The hallmarks of constitutive heterochromatin, HP1 and H3K9me2/3, assemble heterochromatin-like domains/complexes outside canonical constitutively heterochromatic territories where they regulate chromatin template-dependent processes. Domains are more than 100 kb in size; complexes less than 100 kb. They are present in the genomes of organisms ranging from fission yeast to human, with an expansion in size and number in mammals. Some of the likely functions of domains/complexes include silencing of the donor mating type region in fission yeast, preservation of DNA methylation at imprinted germline differentially methylated regions (gDMRs) and regulation of the phylotypic progression during vertebrate development. Far cis- and trans-contacts between micro-phase separated domains/complexes in mammalian nuclei contribute to the emergence of epigenetic compartmental domains (ECDs) detected in Hi-C maps. A thermodynamic description of micro-phase separation of heterochromatin-like domains/complexes may require a gestalt shift away from the monomer as the ""unit of incompatibility"" that determines the sign and magnitude of the Flory-Huggins parameter, &#967;. Instead, a more dynamic structure, the oligo-nucleosomal ""clutch"", consisting of between 2 and 10 nucleosomes is both the long sought-after secondary structure of chromatin and its unit of incompatibility. Based on this assumption we present a simple theoretical framework that enables an estimation of &#967; for domains/complexes flanked by euchromatin and thereby an indication of their tendency to phase separate. The degree of phase separation is specified by &#967;N, where N is the number of ""clutches"" in a domain/complex. Our approach could provide an additional tool for understanding the biophysics of the 3D genome.","Singh, Prim B; Belyakin, Stepan N; Laktionov, Petr P",,,597

To assess air pollution during and after lockdowns, this study selected pandemic hotspots in China (Wuhan), Japan (Tokyo), the Republic of Korea (Daegu), and India (Mumbai) and compared the Air Quality Index (AQI) in these areas for the past three years. The results indicated that air pollution levels were positively correlated with a reduction in pollutant levels during and after lockdowns in these cities. In Tokyo, low levels of air pollution, no significant change in the distribution of ""good"" and ""moderate"" days was observed during lockdown. In Daegu, mid-level air pollution, the percentage of ""unhealthy"" days (AQI>100) markedly reduced during lockdown; however, this reverted after lockdown was lifted. In Wuhan and Mumbai, high air pollution levels, the percentage of unhealthy days remarkably decreased during lockdown and continued to reduce after lockdown. It was found that PM2.5 was the critical pollutant for all cities because its sub-AQI was the largest of the six pollutant species for the majority of days. In addition, PM10 dominated the overall AQI for 2.2-9.6% of the period in Wuhan and Mumbai, and its sub-AQI reduced during lockdown. The mean sub-AQI for NO2, SO2, CO, and O3 was within the ""good"" category for all cities. In conclusion, the lockdown policy reduced air pollution in general and this reduction was more significant for regions with high air pollution levels.","Hu, Meng; Chen, Zhongbing; Cui, Haiyan; Wang, Tao; Zhang, Chao; Yun, Keming",,,597

Data on the SARS-CoV-2-exposure/infection rate of gastrointestinal endoscopy staff is scarce. This study aimed to assess the SARS-CoV-2-exposure/infection rate among gastrointestinal endoscopists/nurses performing gastrointestinal endoscopies before and after the adoption of specific prevention measures. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional study in a teaching hospital (Rome, Central Italy) on retrospective data (9 March-15 April 2020) of consecutive gastrointestinal endoscopies, characteristics of procedures, patients and endoscopy staff, SARS-CoV-2-exposure/positivity of patients and staff before and after adoption of prevention measures. Exposed staff tested for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal swabs(RNA-PCR) and serology. RESULTS: A total of 130 gastrointestinal endoscopies were performed in 130 patients (age 66 ± 14 years, 51% women, 51% inpatients, 56.9% lower). A total of 12 (9.2%) patients were SARS-CoV-2-positive and 14(10.8%) had a high risk of potential infection. Of the endoscopy staff (n = 16, 5 endoscopists, 8 nurses and 3 residents), 14 (87.5%) were exposed to SARS-CoV-2-infected and 16 (100%) to potentially infected patients. 3/5 and 5/5 endoscopists were exposed to actual and potential, 1/3 and 3/3 residents to actual and potential and 8/8 nurses to actual and potential infection, respectively. None of the staff was found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2. None experienced fever or any other suspicious symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019.

We investigated the association between use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) and COVID-19 hospitalization/death in a large nationwide population. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with hypertension, heart failure, diabetes, kidney disease, or ischaemic heart disease registered in the Swedish National Patient Registry until 1 February 2020 were included and followed until 31 May 2020. COVID-19 cases were defined based on hospitalization/death for COVID-19. Multivariable logistic and Cox regressions were fitted to investigate the association between ACEi/ARB and MRA and risk of hospitalization/death for COVID-19 in the overall population, and of all-cause mortality in COVID-19 cases. We performed consistency analysis to quantify the impact of potential unmeasured confounding. Of 1 387 746 patients (60% receiving ACEi/ARB and 5.8% MRA), 7146 (0.51%) had incident hospitalization/death from COVID-19. After adjustment for 45 variables, ACEi/ARB use was associated with a reduced risk of hospitalization/death for COVID-19 (odds ratio 0.86, 95% confidence interval 0.81-0.91) in the overall population, and with reduced mortality in COVID-19 cases (hazard ratio 0.89, 95% confidence interval 0.82-0.96). MRA use was not associated with risk of any outcome. Consistency analysis showed that unmeasured confounding would need to be large for there to be harmful signals associated with RAASi use.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of skin testing and basophil activation testing to PEG, polysorbate 80, BNT162b2 and AZD1222 (Astra-Zeneca) COVID-19 vaccines in patients with a history of PEG allergy. METHODS: Three known PEG allergic participants and three healthy controls were recruited, and evaluated for hypersensitivity to the BNT162b2 and AZD1222 vaccines and related compounds by skin testing and basophil activation measured by CD63 upregulation using flow cytometry. RESULTS: We found that the BNT162b2 vaccine induced positive skin tests in PEG allergic patients, whereas traditional PEG skin testing was negative in two of three patients. One patient was found to be co-sensitized to both the BNT162b2 and AZD1222 vaccines due to cross-reactive PEG and polysorbate allergy. The BNT162b2 vaccine, but not PEG alone, induced dose-dependent activation of all patients' basophils ex vivo. Similar basophil activation could be induced by PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin, suggesting that PEGlyated lipids within nanoparticles, and not PEG in its native state, are able to efficiently induce degranulation. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings implicate PEG, as covalently modified within the vaccine lipid nanoparticle, as a potential trigger of anaphylaxis to BNT162b2.","Troelnikov, Alexander; Perkins, Griffith; Yuson, Chino; Ahamdie, Aida; Balouch, Summaya; Hissaria, Pravin",J. allergy clin. immunol,,597

389054,Cardiothoracic Surgical Residency Programs: A Pandemic Playbook,2020,"Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) plays an important role in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Management of thrombi in ECMO is generally an important issue; especially in ECMO for COVID-19 patients who are prone to thrombus formation, the thrombus formation in oxygenators is an unresolved issue, and it is very difficult to deal with. To prevent thromboembolic complications, it is necessary to develop a method for early thrombus detection. We developed a novel method for detailed real-time observation of thrombi formed in oxygenators using indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging. The purpose of this study was to verify the efficacy of this novel method through animal experiments. The experiments were performed three times using three pigs equipped with veno-arterial ECMO comprising a centrifugal pump (CAPIOX SL) and an oxygenator (QUADROX). To create thrombogenic conditions, the pump flow rate was set at 1 L/min without anticoagulation. The diluted ICG (0.025 mg/mL) was intravenously administered at a dose of 10 mL once an hour. A single dose of ICG was 0.25mg. The oxygenator was observed with both an optical detector (PDE-neo) and the naked eye every hour after measurement initiation for a total of 8 hours. With this dose of ICG, we could observe it by fluorescence imaging for about 15 minutes. Under ICG imaging, the inside of the oxygenator was observed as a white area. A black dot suspected to be the thrombus appeared 6-8 hours after measurement initiation. The thrombus and the black dot on ICG imaging were finely matched in terms of morphology. Thus, we succeeded in real-time thrombus detection in an oxygenator using ICG imaging. The combined use of ICG imaging and conventional routine screening tests could compensate for each other's weaknesses and significantly improve the safety of ECMO.","Sakurai, Hironobu; Fujiwara, Tatsuki; Ohuchi, Katsuhiro; Hijikata, Wataru; Inoue, Yusuke; Seki, Haruna; Tahara, Tomoki; Yokota, Sachie; Ogata, Asato; Mizuno, Tomohiro; Arai, Hirokuni",Artif. organs,,597

Our work is based on a previous systematic literature review of 42 articles on CE through open coding following grounded theory. This allowed us to identify 68 CECPs and classify them into three levels of abstraction: microenvironmental, macroenvironmental, and organizational. To make this general research relevant to the tourism industry we conducted semi-structured interviews with 33 experts in CE and tourism, ensuring that theoretical saturation was reached. The data was analyzed in two coding phases, identifying which general CECPs are applicable to the tourism industry and which of them need further specification. The result shows that 34 of the 68 CECPs are applicable to tourism, of which 41% need to be specified to be relevant to the sector. Especially at the microenvironmental level, 53% of the general CECPs needed to be specified for the case of tourism. The analysis allowed to identify the 10 most crucial CECPs for the tourism industry and which of them have been most affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.","Martínez-Cabrera, Julia López-del-Pino Francisco",Sustainability,,597

390616,Correction to: Protecting Medical Trainees on the COVID-19 Frontlines Saves Us All,2020,"Neutrophils are primary effector cells of innate immunity and fight infection by phagocytosis and degranulation. Activated neutrophils also release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in response to a variety of stimuli. These NETs are net-like complexes composed of cell-free DNA, histones and neutrophil granule proteins. Besides the evolutionarily conserved mechanism to capture and eliminate pathogens, NETs are also associated with pathophysiological processes of various diseases. Here, we elucidate the mechanisms of NET formation and their different implications in disease. We focused on autoinflammatory and cardiovascular disorders as the leading cause of death. Neutrophil extracellular traps are not only present in various cardiovascular diseases but play an essential role in atherosclerotic plaque formation, arterial and venous thrombosis, as well as in the development and progression of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Furthermore, NETosis can be considered as a source of autoantigens and maintains an inflammatory milieu promoting autoimmune diseases. Indeed, there is further need for research into the balance between NET induction, inhibition, and degradation in order to pharmacologically target NETs and their compounds without impairing the patient's immune defense. This review may be of interest to both basic scientists and clinicians to stimulate translational research and innovative clinical approaches.","Klopf, Johannes; Brostjan, Christine; Eilenberg, Wolf; Neumayer, Christoph",Int. j. mol. sci.

METHODS: From October 2015 to September 2018, we conducted active surveillance for acute respiratory illness (ARI) among women during pregnancy. Nurses conducted twice weekly phone and text message follow-up upon enrollment until delivery to identify new episodes of ARI. Nasal and throat swabs were collected &#8804;10 days from illness onset to detect influenza. RESULTS: In total, we enrolled 18 724 pregnant women median aged 28 years old, 37% in first trimester, 48% in second trimester, and 15% in third trimester, with seven self-reported influenza vaccination during pregnancy. In the 18-week epidemic period during October 2015 to September 2016, influenza incidence was 0.7/100 person-months (95% CI: 0.5-0.9). In the cumulative 29-week-long epidemic during October 2016 to September 2017, influenza incidence was 1.0/100 person-months (95% CI: 0.8-1.2). In the 11-week epidemic period during October 2017 to September 2018, influenza incidence was 2.1/100 person-months (95% CI: 1.9-2.4). Influenza incidence was similar by trimester.

AIM/METHODS: To investigate the role of innate immune detection of flagellin irrespective of adaptive immunity, we examined the consequences of loss of toll-like receptor 5 (T5) and/or Nod-like receptor 4 (N4) upon a Rag1-deficient background. RESULTS: Mice lacking TLR5 and Rag1 (T5/Rag-DKO) exhibited frequent lethal Pasteurellaceae-containing abscesses that prevented breeding of these mice. Mice lacking TLR5, NLRC4, and Rag1 (T5/N4/Rag-TKO) also resulted in sporadic lethal abdominal abscesses caused by similar Pasteurellaceae. In the absence of such infections, relative to Rag1-KO, T5/N4/Rag-TKO mice exhibited microbiota encroachment, low-grade inflammation, microbiota dysbiosis, and, moreover were highly prone to Citrobacter infection and developed severe colitis when adoptively transferred with colitogenic T-cells. Relative proneness of T5/N4/Rag-TKO mice to T-cell colitis was ablated by antibiotics while fecal microbiota transplant from T5/N4/Rag-TKO mice to WT mice transferred proneness to Citrobacter infection, indicating that dysbiosis in T5/N4/Rag-TKO mice contributed to these phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate a critical role for innate immune detection of flagellin, especially in the intestinal tract and particularly in hosts deficient in adaptive immunity.","Zou, Jun; Zhao, Xu; Shi, Zhenda; Zhang, Zhan; Vijay-Kumar, Matam; Chassaing, Benoit; Gewirtz, Andrew T",J. infect. dis,,597

We sought to evaluate whether the COVID-19 pandemic may have contributed to delays in acute stroke management at comprehensive stroke centers. METHODS: Pooled clinical data of consecutive adult stroke patients from 14 US comprehensive stroke centers (January 1, 2019, to July 31, 2020) were queried. The rate of thrombolysis for nontransferred patients within the Target: Stroke goal of 60 minutes was compared between patients admitted from March 1, 2019, and July 31, 2019 (pre-COVID-19), and March 1, 2020, to July 31, 2020 (COVID-19). The time from arrival to imaging and treatment with thrombolysis or thrombectomy, as continuous variables, were also assessed. RESULTS: Of the 2955 patients who met inclusion criteria, 1491 were admitted during the pre-COVID-19 period and 1464 were admitted during COVID-19, 15% of whom underwent intravenous thrombolysis. Patients treated during COVID-19 were at lower odds of receiving thrombolysis within 60 minutes of arrival (odds ratio, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.38-0.98]; P=0.04), with a median delay in door-to-needle time of 4 minutes (P=0.03). The lower odds of achieving treatment in the Target: Stroke goal persisted after adjustment for all variables associated with earlier treatment (adjusted odds ratio, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.35-0.85]; P<0.01). The delay in thrombolysis appeared driven by the longer delay from imaging to bolus (median, 29 [interquartile range, 18-41] versus 22 [interquartile range, 13-37] minutes; P=0.02). There was no significant delay in door-to-groin puncture for patients who underwent thrombectomy (median, 83 [interquartile range, 63-133] versus 90 [interquartile range, 73-129] minutes; P=0.30). Delays in thrombolysis were observed in the months of June and July. CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation for acute ischemic stroke during the COVID-19 period was associated with a small but significant delay in intravenous thrombolysis but no significant delay in thrombectomy time metrics. Taking steps to reduce delays from imaging to bolus time has the potential to attenuate this collateral effect of the pandemic.","Siegler, James E; Zha, Alicia M; Czap, Alexandra L; Ortega-Gutierrez, Santiago; Farooqui, Mudassir; Liebeskind, David S; Desai, Shashvat M; Hassan, Ameer E; Starosciak, Amy K; Linfante, Italo; Rai, Vivek; Thon, Jesse M; Then, Ryna; Heslin, Mark E; Thau, Lauren; Khandelwal, Priyank; Mohammaden, Mahmoud H; Haussen, Diogo C; Nogueira, Raul G; Jillella, Dinesh V; Nahab, Fadi; Kaliaev, Artem; Nguyen, Thanh N; Zaidat, Osama; Jovin, Tudor G; Jhadav, Ashutosh P",Stroke,,597

Lack of vaccine and specific anti-viral drugs started a global health disaster. For a sustained control and protection, development of potential anti-viral drugs is one of the targeted approach. Although, designing and developing a panel of new drugs molecules are always encouraged. However, in the current emergency, drug repurposing study is one of the most effective and fast track option. The crystal structure of a SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) RNA Dependent RNA Polymerase (RdRp) has recently been deciphered through X-ray crystallography. The single-chain of core RNA Dependent RNA Polymerase relies on virus-encoded cofactors nsp7 and two units of nsp8 for its optimum function. This study explored the FDA approved database of 7922 molecules and screened against the core polymerase along with cofactors. Here we report a panel of FDA approved drugs that show substantial interactions with key amino acid residues of the active site. Interestingly, some of the identified drugs (Ornipressin, Lypressin, Examorelin, Polymyxin B1) bind strongly within the binding pockets of both forms of RdRp. Besides, we found strong candidates for the complex form as well which include Nacortocin, Cistinexine, Cisatracurium (among others).

Corona virus is a spherical shaped and enveloped positive-sense single stranded RNA virus with a size of ~30 kilobase encoding various structural, non-structural proteins and accessory proteins. The entry of coronavirus into the host cells is mediated by spike proteins which efficiently allow SARS-CoV2 to replicate in host cell by evading immune surveillance like innate and adaptive immune responses in the host cells and ultimately leads to increased virulence and disease outcome. In the current review, we highlighted the molecular insights of SARS-CoV-2 and its infection mechanism in the host cell via host-viral protein interactions based on currently available data up to 16thMay 2020 and using various research literature databases. The detection of coronavirus is mainly by RT-PCR and serological tests.

394279,Covid-19 and re-opening of schools: Opinions with scientific evidence,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is adversely impacting modern human civilization. A global view using a systems science approach is necessary to recognize the close interactions between health of animals, humans and the environment. DISCUSSION: A model is developed initially by describing five sequential or parallel steps on how a RNA virus emerged from animals and became a pandemic: 1. Origins in the animal kingdom; 2. Transmission to domesticated animals; 3. Inter-species transmission to humans; 4. Local epidemics; 5. Global spread towards a pandemic. The next stage identifies global level determinants from the physical environments, the biosphere and social environment that influence these steps to derive a generic conceptual model. It identifies that future pandemics are likely to emerge from ecological processes (climate change, loss of biodiversity), anthropogenic social processes (i.e. corporate interests, culture and globalization) and world population growth. Intervention would therefore require modifications or dampening these generators and prevent future periodic pandemics that would reverse human development. Addressing issues such as poorly planned urbanization, climate change and deforestation coincide with SDGs such as sustainable cities and communities (Goal 11), climate action (Goal 13) and preserving forests and other ecosystems (Goal 15). This will be an added justification to address them as global priorities. Some determinants in the model are poorly addressed by SDGs such as the case of population pressures, cultural factors, corporate interests and globalization. The overarching process of globalization will require modifications to the structures, processes and mechanisms of global governance. The defects in global governance are arguably due to historical reasons and the neo-liberal capitalist order. This became evident especially in the aftermath of the COVID-19 when the vaccination roll-out led to violations of universal values of equity and right to life by some of the powerful and affluent nations. A systems approach leads us to a model that shows the need to tackle several factors, some of which are not adequately addressed by SDGs and require restructuring of global governance and political economy.","Thoradeniya, Tharanga; Jayasinghe, Saroj",Global Health,,597

395780,Vital signs that point to links between COVID-19 and sepsis,2020,"INTRODUCTION: In light of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, protecting vulnerable groups has become a high priority. Persons at risk of severe disease, for example, those receiving immunosuppressive therapies for chronic inflammatory cdiseases (CIDs), are prioritised for vaccination. However, data concerning generation of protective antibody titres in immunosuppressed patients are scarce. Additionally, mRNA vaccines represent a new vaccine technology leading to increased insecurity especially in patients with CID. OBJECTIVE: Here we present for the first time, data on the efficacy and safety of anti-SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in a cohort of immunosuppressed patients as compared with healthy controls. METHODS: 42 healthy controls and 26 patients with CID were included in this study (mean age 37.5 vs 50.5 years). Immunisations were performed according to national guidelines with mRNA vaccines. Antibody titres were assessed by ELISA before initial vaccination and 7 days after secondary vaccination. Disease activity and side effects were assessed prior to and 7 days after both vaccinations. RESULTS: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as well as neutralising activity could be detected in all study participants. IgG titres were significantly lower in patients as compared with controls (2053 binding antibody units (BAU)/mL ±1218 vs 2685±1102). Side effects were comparable in both groups. No severe adverse effects were observed, and no patients experienced a disease flare. CONCLUSION: We show that SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines lead to development of antibodies in immunosuppressed patients without considerable side effects or induction of disease flares. Despite the small size of this cohort, we were able to demonstrate the efficiency and safety of mRNA vaccines in our cohort.","Geisen, Ulf M; Berner, Dennis K; Tran, Florian; Sümbül, Melike; Vullriede, Lena; Ciripoi, Maria; Reid, Hayley M; Schaffarzyk, Annika; Longardt, Ann C; Franzenburg, Jeanette; Hoff, Paula; Schirmer, Jan H; Zeuner, Rainald; Friedrichs, Anette; Steinbach, Andrea; Knies, Christine; Markewitz, Robert Dh; Morrison, Peter J; Gerdes, Sascha; Schreiber, Stefan; Hoyer, Bimba F",Ann. rheum. dis,,597

The aim of our study is to establish laboratory predictors of mortality in COVID-19 disease which can help to identify high risk patients. All patients admitted to hospital due to Covid-19 disease were included. Laboratory biomarkers that contributed with significant predictive value for predicting mortality to the clinical model were included. Cut-off points were established, and finally a risk score was built. 893 patients were included. Median age was 68.2 ± 15.2 years. 87(9.7%) were admitted to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and 72(8.1%) needed mechanical ventilation support. 171(19.1%) patients died. A Covid-19 Lab score ranging from 0 to 30 points was calculated on the basis of a multivariate logistic regression model in order to predict mortality with a weighted score that included haemoglobin, erythrocytes, leukocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, creatinine, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and D-dimer. Three groups were established. Low mortality risk group under 12 points, 12 to 18 were included as moderate risk, and high risk group were those with 19 or more points. Low risk group as reference, moderate and high patients showed mortality OR 4.75(CI95% 2.60-8.68) and 23.86(CI 95% 13.61-41.84), respectively. C-statistic was 0-85(0.82-0.88) and Hosmer-Lemeshow p-value 0.63. Covid-19 Lab score can very easily predict mortality in patients at any moment during admission secondary to SARS-CoV2 infection.

To date, only a few neonatal early-onset sepsis by SARS-COV-2 has been reported worldwide. CASE PRESENTATION: In this report, we present two seriously ill neonates who were born from mothers with stablished COVID-19 pneumonia. Laboratory tests showed lymphopenia with high LDH and hypocalcemia right after the birth. They had fever for days without responding to antibiotics and despite ruling out other potential causes. Both patients had positive RTPCR for SARS-COV-2 in the second round of testing but the first assay tested was negative. Hydroxychloroquine was used to treat both patients; the first patient was treated with it over a period of 14 days before showing signs of improvement. The second patient responded to the treatment over a period of 5 days. CONCLUSION: Although based on the available evidences, vertical transmission of COVID-19 is less likely, many aspects of pathogenesis and transmission of this novel virus are still unclear. Therefore we cannot rule out the vertical transmission totally. Further investigations are warranted to determine the exact mechanisms and routes of transmission.","Sagheb, Setareh; Lamsehchi, Ameneh; Jafary, Mohamadreza; Atef-Yekta, Reza; Sadeghi, Kourosh",Ital J Pediatr,,597

397828,An unusual collateral damage of COVID-19 pandemic Comment,2020,"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The escalating number of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals has conferred the viral spread with the status of global pandemic. However, there are no prophylactic or therapeutic drugs available on the market to treat COVID-19, although several drugs have been approved. Recently, two articles using the comparative viral-human protein-protein interaction map revealed that the sigma-1 receptor in the endoplasmic reticulum plays an important role in SARS-CoV-2 replication in cells. Knockout and knockdown of SIGMAR1 (sigma-1 receptor, encoded by SIGMAR1) caused robust reductions in SARS-CoV-2 replication, which indicates that the sigma-1 receptor is a key therapeutic target for SARS-CoV-2 replication. Interestingly, a recent clinical trial demonstrated that treatment with the antidepressant fluvoxamine, which has a high affinity at the sigma-1 receptor, could prevent clinical deterioration in adult outpatients infected with SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we discuss the brief history of the sigma-1 receptor and its role in SARS-CoV-2 replication in cells. Here, we propose repurposing of traditional central nervous system (CNS) drugs that have a high affinity at the sigma-1 receptor (i.e., fluvoxamine, donepezil, ifenprodil) for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Finally, we discussed the potential of other CNS candidates such as cutamesine and arketamine.","Hashimoto, Kenji",Eur. arch. psychiatr. clin. neurosci,,597

VA primary care patients with elevated anxiety sensitivity (N = 25) were recruited to participate in a mixed-method open pilot to examine acceptability, usability, and preliminary effectiveness in a VA primary care setting. Participants completed an initial visit, that included the intervention, and a one-month follow-up. Veterans found CAST to be generally acceptable, with strong usability ratings. Qualitative analyses identified areas of strength and areas for improvement for use with VA primary care Veterans. Repeated measures ANCOVAs revealed significant effects for symptoms of anxiety, depression, traumatic-stress, and suicidal ideation.

398471,COVID-19: Safe Guidelines for Breast Imaging During the Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Diabetic and obese patients are at higher risk of severe disease and cardiac injury in corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. Cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 is mainly via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is highly expressed in normal hearts. There is a disagreement regarding the effect of factors such as obesity and diabetes on ACE2 expression in the human heart and whether treatment with renin-angiotensin system inhibitors or anti-diabetic medications increases ACE2 expression and subsequently the susceptibility to infection. We designed this study to elucidate factors that control ACE2 expression in human serum, human heart biopsies, and mice. METHODS: Right atrial appendage biopsies were collected from 79 patients that underwent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. We investigated the alteration in ACE2 mRNA and protein expression in heart tissue and serum. ACE2 expression was compared with clinical risk factors: diabetes, obesity and different anti-hypertensive or anti-diabetic therapies. WT or db/db mice were infused with Angiotensin II (ATII), treated with different anti-diabetic drugs (Metformin, GLP1A and SGLT2i) were also tested. RESULTS: ACE2 gene expression was increased in diabetic hearts compared to non-diabetic hearts and was positively correlated with glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), body mass index (BMI), and activation of the renin angiotensin system (RAS), and negatively correlated with ejection fraction. ACE2 was not differentially expressed in patients who were on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) prior to the operation. We found no correlation between plasma free ACE2 and cardiac tissue ACE2 expression. Transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), metalloprotease ADAM10 and ADAM17 that facilitate viral-ACE2 complex entry and degradation were increased in diabetic hearts. ACE2 expression in mice was increased with ATII infusion and attenuated following anti-diabetic drugs treatment. CONCLUSION: Patients with uncontrolled diabetes or obesity with RAS activation have higher ACE2 expressions therefore are at higher risk for severe infection. Since ACEi or ARBs show no effect on ACE2 expression in the heart further support their safety.","Herman-Edelstein, Michal; Guetta, Tali; Barnea, Amir; Waldman, Maayan; Ben-Dor, Naomi; Barak, Yaron; Kornowski, Ran; Arad, Michael; Hochhauser, Edith; Aravot, Dan",Cardiovasc Diabetol,,597

(preprint),2021,"Structural racism in the United States underlies racial disparities in the criminal justice system, in the healthcare system generally, and with regards to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the year 2020, these inequities combined and magnified to such a degree that it left Black Americans and physicians caring for them questioning how much Black lives matter. Academic medical centers and the major cardiology organizations responded to a global call to end racism with bold statements and initiatives. Interventional cardiologists utilize advanced equipment to mechanically treat a wide spectrum of heart problems, yet this technology has not been applied in an equitable manner. Interventional therapies are often underutilized in Blacks, exacerbating healthcare disparities and contributing to the excess cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in these communities. Racial bias, whether intentional, unconscious, systemic, or at the individual level, plays a role in these disparities. Many in the interventional cardiology community aspire to take intentional steps to reduce the impact of bias and racism in our specialty.

or persistent withdrawal, refers to a syndrome that includes anxiety, irritability, hostility, mood instability, fatigue, insomnia and increased physical complaints often related to gastrointestinal symptoms, pain and weakness Unlike acute withdrawal, where treatment guidelines and practices are highly predictable and protocol driven;post-acute interventions are highly symptom driven and individualized Attention to co-occurring medical and psychiatric disorders is vital as well It is well-known that benzodiazepines pose greater risks to older adults including confusion, ataxia, syncope, risk of falls, fractures, delirium and excess hospitalizations Even with these known risks about 20-25% of all inappropriate prescriptions for benzodiazepines are given to older adults There is limited literature on managing post-acute withdrawal syndromes in older adults, with few available guidelines for medication management of emerging symptoms The additional challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic have increased both the stress on older adults in need of care and of providers seeking to engage patients in therapeutic relationships We focus on representative cases of older adults seeking treatment related to benzodiazepines withdrawal and describe flexible treatment approaches for their evolving and complex needs Methods Cases studies were identified from the patient population at Mount Sinai Beth Israel, an urban medical center serving a multicultural and socioeconomically diverse population that includes several NORC sites Mount Sinai Beth Israel has been serving the population of lower Manhattan since 1889 and provides full service behavioral health care including opioid treatment programs Patients were identified from those who presented to the ambulatory care center that offers adult, geriatric and dual-diagnosis services A personalized treatment planning approach was developed in each case and included the time period of the COVID-19 quarantine Results Mr A: 64 year old man with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Opioid Use Disorder in sustained remission on Methadone 270mg daily and Sedative Hypnotic Use Disorder The patient entered treatment for impending Benzodiazepine withdrawal after losing his provider He was taking alprazolam 2mg, clonazepam 6m and zolpidem 10mg daily over the past 30 years Following treatment for acute withdrawal and treatment with a slow taper of clonazepam the patient has been struggling with episodic anxiety and feelings of loss Isolation and boredom related to COVID-19 quarantine conditions have contributed to this making the issue of worsening anxiety with protracted withdrawal symptoms difficult to delineate Ms B:74 year old woman with Generalized Anxiety Disorder entered treatment after her provider closed his practice The patient was prescribed diazepam 40mg, lorazepam 2mg and zolpidem 10mg daily for the past 5 years In addition she was prescribed dextroamphetamine 20 mg daily for 3 years for fatigue Over a 2 year period the medications were tapered using clonazepam;the dextroamphetamine was discontinued While being maintained on clonazepam 0 5mg daily she started to complain of fearfulness, loneliness, insonia and chronic pain which increased with the onset of the COVID-19 quarantine Mirtazpine 7 5mg was started at bedtime with improvement Ms D: 59 year old woman with PTSD, Major Depressive Disorder, Alcohol Use Disorder, Cannabis Use Disorder and Cocaine Use Disorder treated with lorazepam 2 mg daily entered treatment after a previous provider was unable to administer Naltrexone LAI The dose was reduces by 25% every 3 to 4 weeks while mirtazapine was utilized to manage emerging symptoms of depression and insomnia Conclusions We found that patients often entered treatment as a result of prior providers either refusing to continue prescribing benzodiazepines or limiting their practice Patients responded well to engagement but under the increased stress of COVID-19 quarantine conditions symptoms increasingly emerged Our population included patients who were also receiving MAT for sustained remission of Opioid Use Disorder and faced greater risks related to benzodiazepine use Patients were receptive to educational interventions regarding the risks of continuing use and were able to engage in treatment Despite the proven negative outcomes of chronic use providers continue to prescribe benzodiazepines inappropriately to older adults The need to care for patients treated with these agents is high Post-acute withdrawal syndrome is poorly understood and under recognized in older adults Efforts such as de-prescribing, patient centered approaches to rational prescribing and use remote education

A 2D DNA sheet could be modularized into connected parts (e.g. two, three and four parts in this work), which can be independently transformed between two conformations with a few DNA ""trigger"" strands. More interestingly, the transformation of the connected 2D modules can lead to the controlled, resettable structural conversion of a 2D sheet to a 3D architecture, due to the constraints induced by the connections between the 2D modules. This new approach can provide an efficient mean for constructing programmable, higher-order, and complex DNA objects, as well as sophisticated dynamic substrates for various applications.","Liu, Yan; Cheng, Jin; Fan, Sisi; Ge, Huan; Luo, Tao; Tang, Linlin; Ji, Bin; Zhang, Chuan; Cui, Daxiang; Ke, Yonggang; Song, Jie",Angew. chem; int. ed. engl,,597

AIM: To describe the use of influenza prevention and control methods in private practices of the Swiss sentinel network. METHODS: This online cross-sectional survey collected data about infection prevention and control measures in the 166 private practices of the Swiss sentinel surveillance network during the 2018-2019 influenza season. Questions pertained to the practice setting, infection prevention and control recommendations, influenza vaccination status of the physicians and their staff, adhesion to hand hygiene, and mask wearing. FINDINGS: Among the 122 practices that answered (response rate 73.5%), 90.2% of the responding physicians had been vaccinated themselves, and 46.7% (56/120) estimated that their staff vaccination coverage was >60%, although it was offered to employees in all practices. Most practices (N=68, 55.7%) had no specific recommendations for their staff concerning mask wearing. Most physicians reported washing or disinfecting their hands before examining a patient (N=91, 74.6%), after examination (N=110, 90.2%) and before a medical procedure (N=112, 91.8%). However, this rate was lower for arrival at the practice (N=78, 63.9%) and leaving the practice (N=83, 68.0%). CONCLUSION: Most physicians in the Swiss sentinel surveillance network have been vaccinated themselves. However, the vaccination rates among their staff are low, despite vaccine availability. Hand hygiene measures were also suboptimal. These results warrant further efforts to implement infection prevention and control measures in the ambulatory setting.","Peytremann, A; Senn, N; Mueller, Y",J Hosp Infect,,597

402474,COVID-19: The experience from Italy,2021,"BACKGROUND: Many people with dementia are cared for at home by unpaid informal caregivers, usually family members. Caregivers may experience a range of physical, emotional, financial and social harms, which are often described collectively as caregiver burden. The degree of burden experienced is associated with characteristics of the caregiver, such as gender, and characteristics of the person with dementia, such as dementia stage, and the presence of behavioural problems or neuropsychiatric disturbances. It is a strong predictor of admission to residential care for people with dementia. Psychoeducational interventions might prevent or reduce caregiver burden. Overall, they are intended to improve caregivers' knowledge about the disease and its care; to increase caregivers' sense of competence and their ability to cope with difficult situations; to relieve feelings of isolation and allow caregivers to attend to their own emotional and physical needs. These interventions are heterogeneous, varying in their theoretical framework, components, and delivery formats. Interventions that are delivered remotely, using printed materials, telephone or video technologies, may be particularly suitable for caregivers who have difficulty accessing face-to-face services because of their own health problems, poor access to transport, or absence of substitute care. During the COVID-19 pandemic, containment measures in many countries required people to be isolated in their homes, including people with dementia and their family carers. In such circumstances, there is no alternative to remote delivery of interventions. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and acceptability of remotely delivered interventions aiming to reduce burden and improve mood and quality of life of informal caregivers of people with dementia. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, MEDLINE, Embase and four other databases, as well as two international trials registries, on 10 April 2020. We also examined the bibliographies of relevant review papers and published trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included only randomised controlled trials that assessed the remote delivery of structured interventions for informal caregivers who were providing care for people with dementia living at home. Caregivers had to be unpaid adults (relatives or members of the person's community). The interventions could be delivered using printed materials, the telephone, the Internet or a mixture of these, but could not involve any face-to-face contact with professionals. We categorised intervention components as information, training or support. Information interventions included two key elements: (i) they provided standardised information, and (ii) the caregiver played a passive role. Support interventions promoted interaction with other people (professionals or peers). Training interventions trained caregivers in practical skills to manage care. We excluded interventions that were primarily individual psychotherapy. Our primary outcomes were caregiver burden, mood, health-related quality of life and dropout for any reason. Secondary outcomes were caregiver knowledge and skills, use of health and social care resources, admission of the person with dementia to institutional care, and quality of life of the person with dementia. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Study selection, data extraction and assessment of the risk of bias in included studies were done independently by two review authors. We used the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) to describe the interventions. We conducted meta-analyses using a random-effects model to derive estimates of effect size. We used GRADE methods to describe our degree of certainty about effect estimates. MAIN RESULTS: We included 26 studies in this review (2367 participants). We compared (1) interventions involving training, support or both, with or without information (experimental interventions) with usual treatment, waiting list or attention control (12 studies, 944 participants); and (2) the same experimental interventions with provision of information alone (14 studies, 1423 participants). We downgraded evidence for study limitations and, for some outcomes, for inconsistency between studies. There was a frequent risk of bias from self-rating of subjective outcomes by participants who were not blind to the intervention. Randomisation methods were not always well-reported and there was potential for attrition bias in some studies. Therefore, all evidence was of moderate or low certainty. In the comparison of experimental interventions with usual treatment, waiting list or attention control, we found that the experimental interventions probably have little or no effect on caregiver burden (nine studies, 597 participants; standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.35 to 0.23); depressive symptoms (eight studies, 638 participants; SMD -0.05, 95% CI -0.22 to 0.12); or health-related quality of life (two studies, 311 participants; SMD 0.10, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.32). The experimental interventions probably result in little or no difference in dropout for any reason (eight studies, 661 participants; risk ratio (RR) 1.15, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.53). In the comparison of experimental interventions with a control condition of information alone, we found that experimental interventions may result in a slight reduction in caregiver burden (nine studies, 650 participants; SMD -0.24, 95% CI -0.51 to 0.04); probably result in a slight improvement in depressive symptoms (11 studies, 1100 participants; SMD -0.25, 95% CI -0.43 to -0.06); may result in little or no difference in caregiver health-related quality of life (two studies, 257 participants; SMD -0.03, 95% CI -0.28 to 0.21); and probably result in an increase in dropouts for any reason (12 studies, 1266 participants; RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.20). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Remotely delivered interventions including support, training or both, with or without information, may slightly reduce caregiver burden and improve caregiver depressive symptoms when compared with provision of information alone, but not when compared with usual treatment, waiting list or attention control. They seem to make little or no difference to health-related quality of life. Caregivers receiving training or support were more likely than those receiving information alone to drop out of the studies, which might limit applicability. The efficacy of these interventions may depend on the nature and availability of usual services in the study settings.","González-Fraile, Eduardo; Ballesteros, Javier; Rueda, José-Ramón; Santos-Zorrozúa, Borja; Solà, Ivan; McCleery, Jenny",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,,597

We conducted the current national study among a cohort of PWUD to understand how COVID-19 has affected service access, including any significant impacts PWUD may have experienced. Results will contribute to the evidence base for informing future pandemic and public health policy planning for vulnerable populations. METHODS: The project involved qualitative telephone-based interviews with 196 adult (aged 18+) PWUD from across Canada. Eligibility criteria included daily or weekly use of psychoactive substance(s), and/or current enrollment in opioid agonist treatment (OAT). Data collection took place between May and July 2020. Data underwent thematic analyses, and common themes informed the results. RESULTS: Most participants experienced detrimental service access issues and treatment disruptions during COVID-19, including reduced access to harm reduction services, OAT, withdrawal management and treatment services, medical professionals (e.g., addictions and mental health counseling), shelters/housing, and food banks. Positive impacts included greater access to OAT take-home 'carries' and prescription deliveries. Decreases in service capacity resulted in increased health issues and risky substance use behaviors among PWUD, such as unaccompanied substance use, sharing/re-use of supplies, and overdose events. CONCLUSIONS: Reductions in the accessibility of critical services PWUD rely on during COVID-19 has increased existent substance use and health issues among PWUD, while decreasing their ability to mitigate risks related to substance use. Thus, the expansion of the depth and breadth of support options is crucial. Services must remain open and flexible to the unique needs of PWUD during COVID-19, while novel and effective adaptations and interventions should remain available and accessible post-COVID-19.","Russell, Cayley; Ali, Farihah; Nafeh, Frishta; Rehm, Jürgen; LeBlanc, Sean; Elton-Marshall, Tara",J Subst Abuse Treat,,597

404977,"Definitions, instruments and correlates of patient empowerment: A descriptive review",2021,"BackgroundSevere coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized, in part, by an excessive inflammatory response. Evidence from animal and human studies suggests that vagus nerve stimulation can lead to reduced levels of various pro-inflammatory cytokines. We conducted a prospective randomized controlled study (SAVIOR-I) to assess the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation (nVNS) for the treatment of respiratory symptoms and inflammatory markers among patients who were hospitalized for COVID-19 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04368156). MethodsParticipants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 allocation to receive either the standard of care (SoC) alone or nVNS therapy plus the SoC. The nVNS group received 2 consecutive 2-minute doses of nVNS 3 times daily as prophylaxis. Efficacy and safety were evaluated via the incidence of specific clinical events, inflammatory biomarker levels, and the occurrence of adverse events. ResultsOf the 110 participants who were enrolled and randomly assigned, 97 (nVNS, n=47; SoC, n=50) had sufficient available data and comprised the evaluable population. C-reactive protein (CRP) levels decreased from baseline to a significantly greater degree in the nVNS group than in the SoC group at day 5 and overall (ie, all postbaseline data points collected through day 5, combined). Procalcitonin level also showed significantly greater decreases from baseline to day 5 in the nVNS group than in the SoC group. D-dimer levels were decreased from baseline for the nVNS group and increased from baseline for the SoC group at day 5 and overall, although the difference between the treatment groups did not reach statistical significance. No significant treatment differences were seen for clinical respiratory outcomes or any of the other biochemical markers evaluated. No serious nVNS-related adverse events occurred during the study. ConclusionsnVNS therapy led to significant reductions in levels of inflammatory markers, specifically CRP and procalcitonin. Because nVNS has multiple mechanisms of action that may be relevant to COVID-19, additional research into its potential to be used earlier in the course of COVID-19 and possibly mitigate some of the symptoms associated with post-acute COVID-19 syndrome is warranted.","Tornero, Carlos; Pastor, Ernesto; Garzando, Maria del Mar; Orduna, Jorge; Forner, Maria Jose; Bocigas, Irene; Cedeno, David; Vallejo, Ricardo; Staats, Peter; Liebler, Eric",,,597

Recent SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility studies in cats show that the virus can replicate in these companion animals and transmit to other cats. Here, we present an in-depth study of SARS-CoV-2 infection, disease and transmission in domestic cats. Cats were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 via intranasal and oral routes. One day post challenge (DPC), two sentinel cats were introduced. Animals were monitored for clinical signs, clinicopathological abnormalities and viral shedding. Postmortem examinations were performed at 4, 7 and 21 DPC. Viral RNA was not detected in blood but transiently in nasal, oropharyngeal and rectal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid as well as various tissues. Tracheobronchoadenitis of submucosal glands with the presence of viral RNA and antigen was observed in airways of the infected cats.

407830,ACE2 and COVID-19 and the resulting ARDS,2020,"Background and objective: Cryptosporidiosis is a diarrheal disease that affects millions of people worldwide and can cause dire effects in immunocompromised, HIV/AIDS patients and younger children. Cryptosporidium species are causative agents for cryptosporidiosis. The presently available chemotherapeutic options are not fully effective in curbing the menace of disease in all patients. The deprived experimental traceability of the pathogen, lack of a suitable in-vivo model are few factors that hindered the development of reliable chemotherapeutic options despite continuous efforts. The underway COVID-19 pandemic widens this gap as most of the scientific resources and researches shifted priority. The genome sequencing of the Cryptosporidium parvum (C. parvum) has discovered many new targets, such as Inosine 5′-Monophosphate Dehydrogenase (IMPDH), Lactate Dehydrogenase and many more. The parasite uses the host adenosine pool to synthesize guanine nucleotide in a streamlined pathway, where IMPDH catalyzes the first rate-limiting step. The present study aims to discover new anti-cryptosporidial agents that work against the IMPDH of the parasite. Methodology and results: In this study, The PharmaGist (https://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/PharmaGist/) tool was deployed for the pharmacophore model generation employing previously reported Cryptosporidium parvum IMPDH (CpIMPDH) inhibitors having IC50 values ranging from 0.009 μM to 0.028 μM. The model having the highest scores was used as a 3D query for high throughput screening of the Zinc database via ZINC pharmer (http://zincpharmer.csb.pitt.edu/) tool. The screened 'hits' were further subjected to molecular docking in the active site of CpIMPDH (PDB ID:4IXH), Lipinski's rule of 5, and SwissADME (http://www.swissadme.ch/) filter. Finally, the best three 'hits' or proposed leads (ZINC09672610, ZINC16511373, and ZINC39780256) docked CpIMPDH were further subjected to 50 ns molecular dynamic simulation (MDL) analysis for stability analysis. Conclusion and significance: The ZINC09672610 and ZINC39780256 compounds show excellent in-silico inhibitory efficacy against CpIMPDH. These compounds were used as a starting point for the discovery and development of new anti-cryptosporidial compounds. Future anti-cryptosporidial agents could be designed by utilizing these three molecules.","Katiyar, K.; Srivastava, R. K.; Nath, R.",Informatics in Medicine Unlocked,,597

OBJECTIVE: To quantify glycemia, glycemic variability (GV), and magnitude/duration of low sensor glucose (SG) values in patients with PBH after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (PBH-RYGB). DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. SETTING: Academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals with PBH-RYGB (n=40), reactive hypoglycemia without GI surgery (Non-Surg Hypo, n=20), pre-diabetes (Pre-DM, n=14), newly-diagnosed T2D (n=5), and healthy controls (HC, n=38). INTERVENTIONS: Masked CGM (Dexcom G4) was used to assess patterns over 24 hours, daytime (6 AM-midnight) and nighttime (midnight-6 AM).Outcome measures: Prespecified measures included mean and median SG, variability, and percent time at thresholds of sensor glucose. RESULTS: Mean and median SG were similar for PBH-RYGB and HC (mean: 99.8±18.6 vs. 96.9±10.2 mg/dL; median: 93.0±14.8 vs. 94.5±7.4 mg/dL). PBH-RYGB had a higher coefficient of variation (27.3±6.8 vs. 17.9±2.4%, p<0.0001) and range (154.5±50.4 vs. 112.0±26.7 mg/dL, p<0.0001). Nadir was lowest in PBH-RYGB (42.5±3.7 vs. HC 49.0±11.9 mg/dL, p=0.0046), with >2-fold greater time with SG<70 mg/dL vs. HC (7.7±8.4 vs. 3.2±4.1%, p=0.0013); these differences were greater at night (12.6±16.9 vs. 1.0±1.5%, p<0.0001). Non-Surg Hypo also had 4-fold greater time with SG<70 at night vs. HC (SG <70: 4.0 ± 5.9% vs 1.0 ± 1.5%), but glycemic variability was not increased. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PBH-RYGB experience higher glycemic variability and frequency of SG<70 compared to HC, especially at night. These data suggest that additional pathophysiologic mechanisms beyond prandial changes contribute to PBH.","Lee, Daniel; Dreyfuss, Jonathan M; Sheehan, Amanda; Puleio, Alexa; Mulla, Christopher M; Patti, Mary Elizabeth",J. clin. endocrinol. metab,,597

However, VPS29 deficiency had no effect on certain other viruses that enter cells via endosomes and had an opposing, enhancing effect on influenza A virus infection. VPS29 deficiency caused changes endosome morphology, and acidity and attenuated the activity of endosomal proteases. These changes in endosome properties caused incoming coronavirus, but not influenza virus particles, to become entrapped therein. Overall, these data show how host regulation of endosome characteristics can influence viral susceptibility and identify a host pathway that could serve as a pharmaceutical target for intervention in zoonotic viral diseases.","Poston, Daniel; Weisblum, Yiska; Hobbs, Alvaro; Bieniasz, Paul D",,,597

In the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, applicable research and clinical trials should be undertaken in relevant populations in order to extrapolate to a population level. This is all the more important in Africa, which has a rich genetic diversity. We suggest that a lack of organized research ethics committees across the continent and a deficiency of appropriate training are responsible in part for the reluctance of clinical trial organizers in the developed countries of the Global North to engage with medical leadership in Africa. We consider ways of alleviating this problem, including suggesting a pan-continental surveillance of ethics committee agendas and of training, either through the auspices of the African Union or the World Health Organization. In addition, medical leadership in African nations must be encouraged to take ownership of their medical ethics agendas to facilitate decent international clinical trial participation for the good of the continent as a whole.","Taylor-Robinson, Simon D; Spearman, C Wendy; Suliman, Ahmed A A",QJM,,597

We examine their analyses of results from the COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey (CTIS) and show that, despite their claims, CTIS in fact performs well for its intended goals. Our examination reveals several limitations in the data defect correlation framework, including that it is only applicable for a single goal (population point estimation) and that it does not admit the possibility of measurement error. Through examples, we show that these limitations seriously affect the applicability of the framework for analyzing CTIS results. Through our own alternative analyses, we arrive at different conclusions, and we argue for a more expansive view of survey quality that accounts for the intended uses of the data and all sources of error, in line with the Total Survey Error framework that have been widely studied and implemented by survey methodologists.","Reinhart, Alex; Tibshirani, Ryan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.00680v1.pdf,597

413749,Time-to-Death approach in revealing Chronicity and Severity of COVID-19 across the World,2020,"Context Clinical autopsies have historically provided a fundamental contribution in the definition of the clinico-pathological basis of infectious diseases. Even though we are witnessing the decline of the clinical autopsy, its importance remains unchanged as it is the most exhaustive way to investigate diseases. The identification of the virus in postmortem tissues is a fundamental step in the definition of its clinical features. Objective To investigate the presence of Sars-CoV-2 in the postmortem with swabs. Design We performed postmortem swabs in 12 autopsy cases of patients with a clinical diagnosis of Sars-CoV-2 related pneumonia. Our protocol, consisted of a rhino-pharingeal and a tracheal swab in order to search for the virus in the upper airways and of two swabs on the parenchyma of each lung. We also performed a fifth swab on the parenchyma of both lungs in order to search for other viruses that could evolve in a clinical picture of interstitial pneumonia Results Overall we found that 9 out of 12 cases had at least one postmortem swab to be positive for Sars-CoV-2. Moreover we evaluated the time lapse between the antemortem and the postmortem swabs, the time between death and the postmortem swabs, and the time lapse between the postmortem swabs and the acceptance to the microbiology laboratory. Interestingly we did not find a relation neither between the results of the swabs and the time lapsed from their collection, or with the time lapsed before their acceptance in the microbiology laboratory. Conclusions A thorough knowledge of the eventual persistence of pathogens in deaths related to infectious diseases is fundamental for the safety of the operators during the autopsy practice, especially when referring to emergent pathogens like Sars-Cov-2. Our study highlights the importance in performing multiple swabs in the postmortem, since Sars-CoV-2 swab positivity can be limited to only a single swab.","Dell039,; Aquila, Marco; Cattani, Paola; Fantoni, Massimo; Marchetti, Simona; Aquila, Isabella; Stigliano, Egidio; Carbone, Arnaldo; Oliva, Antonio; Arena, Vincenzo",Arch. pathol. lab. med.

While death is considered an unavoidable end for LTC home residents, the importance of facilitating a good death is one of the primary goals of palliative and end-of-life care. Nurse practitioners (NPs) are well-situated to optimize the palliative and end-of-life care needs of LTC home residents. This study explores the role of NPs in facilitating a dignified death for LTC home residents while also facing increased pressures related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The current exploratory qualitative study employed a phenomenological approach. A purposive sample of 14 NPs working in LTC homes was recruited. Data were generated using semi-structured interviews and examined using thematic analysis. Three categories were derived: (a) advance care planning and goals of care discussions;(b) pain and symptom management at the end-of-life;and (c) care after death. The findings suggest that further implementation of the NP role in LTC homes in collaboration with LTC home team and external partners will promote a good death and optimize the experiences of residents and their care partners during the end-of-life journey.","Vellani, Shirin Boscart Veronique Escrig-Pinol Astrid Cumal Alexia Krassikova Alexandra Sidani Souraya Zheng Nancy Yeung Lydia McGilton Katherine S.",Journal of Personalized Medicine,,597

414578,"Estimates of mortality attributable to COVID-19: a statistical model for monitoring COVID-19 and seasonal influenza, Denmark, spring 2020",2021,"Face masks are primary line of defense to reduce the transmission risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). World Health Organization (WHO) has already updated the guidelines and advised the use of face masks in public areas essentially. This has dramatically increased the production and use of face masks in many parts of the world. Arabian Peninsula is comprised of six countries where the public perception of following WHO guidelines is high. In this study, we highlight the concerns relating to extensive use of face masks in this region, particularly in the context of (micro-)plastic pollution. We computed the number of face masks to be used in each of the countries of Arabian Peninsula for varying levels of acceptance rate and average number of daily usages. Accordingly, the amount of (micro-)plastic that could come into the terrestrial and marine environment is also reported. Saudi Arabia, being the most populated country in the region may contribute up to 32 - 235 thousand tons of (micro-)plastic which is nearly half of the amount in the whole Peninsula. On the other hand, an extremely high infection rate in Qatar (25.74%) may also lead to a significant increase of (micro-)plastic content due to high public acceptance rate and living standards. The high (micro-)plastic fraction is of significant concern because it ends up in the marine ecosystems. Further, it allows colonization of several pathogenic microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, fungal filaments, and spores) and might serve as carriers of disease transmission finally affecting the living organisms habituating these ecosystems. It is suggested that appropriate regulations on face masks waste should be devised to avoid any unwanted consequences in the near future.","Akber Abbasi, Saddam; Khalil, Amjad B; Arslan, Muhammad",,,597

Therefore, it is necessary to build flows of nutritional assistance practices at the pediatric hospital level, based on the recommendations of the Federal Council of Nutritionists and the Brazilian Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition, aiming at not generating a deficit in the nutritional monitoring of the patient and in reducing the risk of contamination of the professional. When individual protection equipment is available, nutritional admission will be made in person and during hospitalization, monitoring can be performed using secondary data from electronic medical records and / or telecommunication with the multidisciplinary team. The implementation of nutritional routines in hospitals in times of Covid-19 pandemic generates more assertive conducts for the prevention and treatment of malnutrition and other nutritional implications, also guaranteeing the safety of professionals in assistance in pediatric units..","Queiroz, Aline Pereira; Santos, Caroline dos; Reis, Greice Milena SantAna; Matos, Paulo Sergio Carvalho; Santos, Rogério dos Santos e; Silva, Tamires de Jesus",Rev.

Yet, generating clinical evidence of efficacy and safety of these candidate treatments may be frustrated by the absence of comprehensive trial coordination mechanisms. Many small stand-alone trials and observational studies of single-agent interventions are currently running or in planning; many of these will likely not deliver robust results that could support regulatory and patient-level treatment decisions. In this paper, we discuss actions that all stakeholders in the clinical trial ecosystem need to take to ensure that the window of opportunity during this pandemic will not shut, both for patients in need of treatment and for researchers to conduct decision-relevant clinical trials.","Eichler, Hans-Georg; Cavaleri, Marco; Enzmann, Harald; Scotti, Francesca; Sepodes, Bruno; Sweeney, Fergus; Vamvakas, Spiros; Rasi, Guido",Clin Pharmacol Ther,,597

In educational policy, however, the idea that we should prepare for an unknown, uncontrollable and risky future has been widely accepted long before the outbreak. Building on insights from complexity theory and the study of dynamic systems, the article critically examines how the standard educational response to future unpredictability, which focuses on enhancing adaptability, fares in a time of crisis. It is argued that the emphasis on adaptability in response to a world that is increasingly becoming volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous is often uncritically embraced in educational policy. We suggest that furthering adaptability through education could be suited for tackling everyday uncertainty, yet is an ill-suited response to crisis situations because it hinders transformative change. The article also points to some additional difficulties with striving to further adaptability. Instead, it is argued that developing a vision might prove to be instrumental in guiding an adequate educational response. It is acknowledged that relying on a vision might raise some difficulties, but it is maintained that these can be, at least partially, avoided.

416644,Lessons learnt during the first 100 days of COVID-19 pandemic in India,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 worldwide emergence and evolution has resulted in variants containing mutations resulting in immune evasive epitopes that decrease vaccine efficacy. We acquired clinical samples, analyzed SARS-CoV-2 genomes, used the most worldwide emerged spike mutations from Variants of Concern/Interest, and developed an algorithm for monitoring the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine platform. The algorithm partitions logarithmic-transformed prevalence data monthly and Pearsons correlation determines exponential emergence. The SARS-CoV-2 genome evaluation indicated 49 mutations. Nine of the ten most worldwide prevalent (>70%) spike protein changes have r-values >0.9. The tenth, D614G, has a prevalence >99% and r-value of 0.67. The resulting algorithm is based on the patterns these ten substitutions elucidated. The strong positive correlation of the emerged spike protein changes and algorithmic predictive value can be harnessed in designing vaccines with relevant immunogenic epitopes. SARS-CoV-2 is predicted to remain endemic and continues to evolve, so must SARS-CoV-2 monitoring and next-generation vaccine design.","Maison, David P; Ching, Lauren L; Cleveland, Sean B; Tseng, Alanna C; Nakano, Eileen; Shikuma, Cecilia M; Nerurkar, Vivek R",,,597

417004,COVID-19 containment measures adopted by Italian Paediatric Oncology and Haematology Association (AIEOP) centres to prevent the virus spread among healthcare providers,2020,"BACKGROUND: The mammalian target of rapamycin protein (mTOR) signaling pathway is involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and the mechanism of extrapyramidal adverse reactions to antipsychotic drugs, which might be mediated by an mTOR-dependent autophagy impairment. This study aimed to examine the expression of mTOR pathway genes in patients with schizophrenia treated with olanzapine, which is considered an mTOR inhibitor and autophagy inducer. METHODS: Thirty-two patients with acute schizophrenia who had been treated with olanzapine for four weeks (average dose 14.24 ± 4.35 mg/d) and 32 healthy volunteers were recruited. Before and after olanzapine treatment, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) was used to evaluate the symptoms of patients with schizophrenia, and the mRNA expression levels of mTOR pathway-related genes, including MTOR, RICTOR, RAPTOR, and DEPTOR, were detected in fasting venous blood samples from all subjects using real-time quantitative PCR. RESULTS: The MTOR and RICTOR mRNA expression levels in patients with acute schizophrenia were significantly decreased compared with those of healthy controls and further significantly decreased after four weeks of olanzapine treatment. The DEPTOR mRNA expression levels in patients with acute schizophrenia were not significantly different from those of healthy controls but were significantly increased after treatment. The expression levels of the RAPTOR mRNA were not significantly different among the three groups. The pairwise correlations of MTOR, DEPTOR, RAPTOR, and RICTOR mRNA expression levels in patients with acute schizophrenia and healthy controls were significant. After olanzapine treatment, the correlations between the expression levels of the DEPTOR and MTOR mRNAs and between the DEPTOR and RICTOR mRNAs disappeared. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormalities in the mTOR pathway, especially DEPTOR and mTORC2, might play important roles in the autophagy mechanism underlying the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and effects of olanzapine treatment.","Cui, Fengwei; Gu, Shuguang; Gu, Yue; Yin, Jiajun; Fang, Chunxia; Liu, Liang",BMC Psychiatry,,597

417170,Medical Apps and the Gray Zone in the COVID-19 Era: Between Evidence and New Needs for Cybersecurity Expansion,2021,"The development of effective and safe vaccines is the ultimate way to efficiently stop the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Built on the fact that SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the association of its Spike (S) protein with the human Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to invade host cells, we computationally redesigned the S protein sequence to improve its immunogenicity and antigenicity. Toward this purpose, we extended an evolutionary protein design algorithm, EvoDesign, to create thousands of stable S protein variants that perturb the core protein sequence but keep the surface conformation and B cell epitopes. The T cell epitope content and similarity scores of the perturbed sequences were calculated and evaluated. Out of 22,914 designs with favorable stability energy, 301 candidates contained at least two pre-existing immunity-related epitopes and had promising immunogenic potential. The benchmark tests showed that, although the epitope restraints were not included in the scoring function of EvoDesign, the top S protein design successfully recovered 31 out of the 32 major histocompatibility complex (MHC) -II T cell promiscuous epitopes in the native S protein, where two epitopes were present in all seven human coronaviruses. Moreover, the newly designed S protein introduced nine new MHC-II T cell promiscuous epitopes that do not exist in the wildtype SARS-CoV-2. These results demonstrated a new and effective avenue to enhance a target protein's immunogenicity using rational protein design, which could be applied for new vaccine design against COVID-19 and other human viruses.","Ong, Edison; Huang, Xiaoqiang; Pearce, Robin; Zhang, Yang; He, Yongqun",,,597

417456,COVID-19: an ethical predicament and the dichotomy of society,2021,"OBJECTIVES: In most European countries, patients seeking medication abortion during the COVID-19 pandemic are still required to attend healthcare settings in person. We assessed whether demand for self-managed medication abortion provided by online telemedicine increased following the emergence of COVID-19. METHODS: We examined 3915 requests for self-managed abortion to online telemedicine service Women on Web (WoW) between 1 January 2019 and 1 June 2020. We used regression discontinuity to compare request rates in eight European countries before and after they implemented lockdown measures to slow COVID-19 transmission. We examined the prevalence of COVID-19 infection, the degree of government-provided economic support, the severity of lockdown travel restrictions and the medication abortion service provision model in countries with and without significant changes in requests. RESULTS: Five countries showed significant increases in requests to WoW, ranging from 28% in Northern Ireland (97 requests vs 75.8 expected requests, p=0.001) to 139% in Portugal (34 requests vs 14.2 expected requests, p<0.001). Two countries showed no significant change in requests, and one country, Great Britain, showed an 88% decrease in requests (1 request vs 8.1 expected requests, p<0.001). Among countries with significant increases in requests, abortion services are provided mainly in person in hospitals or abortion is unavailable and international travel was prohibited during lockdown. By contrast, Great Britain implemented a fully remote no-test telemedicine service. CONCLUSION: These marked changes in requests for self-managed medication abortion during the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrate demand for remote models of care, which could be fulfilled by expanding access to medication abortion by telemedicine.","Aiken, Abigail R A; Starling, Jennifer E; Gomperts, Rebecca; Scott, James G; Aiken, Catherine E",BMJ sex. reprod. health (Online),,597

418103,The Novel Concept of Patient Self-Imaging: Success in COVID-19 and Cardiopulmonary Disorders,2021,"More than one year has passed since the first cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 coronavirus were reported in Wuhan (China), rapidly evolving into a global pandemic. This infectious disease has become a major public health challenge in the world. Unfortunately, to date, no specific antivirals have been proven to be effective against COVID-19, and although a few vaccines are available, the mortality rate is not decreasing but is still increasing. One therapeutic strategy has been focused on infection prevention and control measures. In this regard, the use of nutraceutical supports may play a role against some aspect of the infection, particularly the inflammatory state and the immune system function of patients, thus representing a strategy to control the worst outcomes of this pandemic. For this reason, we performed an overview including meta-analyses and systematic reviews to assess the association among melatonin, vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc supplementation and inflammatory markers using three databases, namely, MEDLINE, PubMed Central and the Cochrane Library of Systematic Reviews. According to the evidence available, an intake of 50,000 IU/month of vitamin D showed efficacy in CRP. An amount of 1 to 2 g per day of vitamin C demonstrated efficacy both in CRP and endothelial function, and a dosage of melatonin ranging from 5 to 25 mg /day showed good evidence of efficacy in CRP, TNF and IL6. A dose of 50 mg/day of elemental zinc supplementation showed positive results in CRP. Based on the data reported in this review, the public health system could consider whether it is possible to supplement the current limited preventive measures through targeted nutraceutical large-scale administration.","Corrao, Salvatore; Mallaci Bocchio, Raffaella; Lo Monaco, Marika; Natoli, Giuseppe; Cavezzi, Attilio; Troiani, Emidio; Argano, Christiano",Nutrients,,597

418901,Improving the safety of nasogastric tube insertion by the “SORT maneuver” during the novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19),2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been categorized as evolving in overlapping phases. First, there is a viral phase that may well be asymptomatic or mild in the majority, perhaps 80% of patients. The pathophysiological mechanisms resulting in minimal disease in this initial phase are not well known. In the remaining 20% of cases, the disease may become severe and/or critical. In most patients of this latter group, there is a phase characterized by the hyperresponsiveness of the immune system. A third phase corresponds to a state of hypercoagulability. Finally, in the fourth stage organ injury and failure occur. Appearance of autoinflammatory/autoimmune phenomena in patients with COVID-19 calls attention for the development of new strategies for the management of life-threatening conditions in critically ill patients. Antiphospholipid syndrome, autoimmune cytopenia, Guillain-Barré syndrome and Kawasaki disease have each been reported in patients with COVID-19. Here we present a scoping review of the relevant immunological findings in COVID-19 as well as the current reports about autoinflammatory/autoimmune conditions associated with the disease. These observations have crucial therapeutic implications since immunomodulatory drugs are at present the most likely best candidates for COVID-19 therapy. Clinicians should be aware of these conditions in patients with COVID-19, and these observations should be considered in the current development of vaccines.","Rodríguez, Yhojan; Novelli, Lucia; Rojas, Manuel; De Santis, Maria; Acosta-Ampudia, Yeny; Monsalve, Diana M; Ramírez-Santana, Carolina; Costanzo, Antonio; Ridgway, William M; Ansari, Aftab A; Gershwin, M Eric; Selmi, Carlo; Anaya, Juan-Manuel",J Autoimmun,,597

It exhibits several drawbacks especially on highly dividing and developing cells. This study aimed to assess the role of Opuntia ficus indica ethanolic extract on testicular damage induced by MTX in rat. MTX was administrated for 10 days (20 mg/kg). Extract of cactus cladodes (Opuntia ficus indica) was given to MTX-treated rats (0.4 g/kg). Spermatozoa were collected from cauda epididymis and analyzed for sperm count and motility. Testis samples were used for histopathological and oxidative stress studies (assessment of malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, protein carbonyls (PCs), catalase (CAT) glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities). Moreover, levels of testosterone were measured in serum by radioimmunoassay. Our results showed that MTX had destructive effects on sperm count and motility associated with significant decrease in testosterone levels in MTX group. This effect was then confirmed by docking results. Testis of MTX group showed increased oxidative stress status. In fact, PCs and MDA were increased and CAT, GPx and SOD were decreased suggesting increased reactive oxygen species and deficiency in enzymatic antioxidant. These findings were associated with disrupted testicular morphology as assessed by histological study. Cladodes extract had protective effects on rat's gonad histology, oxidative stress and improve both sperm parameters (count and motility) and serum testosterone levels. In conclusion, our results suggested that Opuntia ficus indica cladodes extract improved MTX-induced testicular injury and possess potent fertility boosting effects in rats.

419375,Targeting MMP-Regulation of Inflammation to Increase Metabolic Tolerance to COVID-19 Pathologies: A Hypothesis,2021,"Background: Evidence regarding timing of tracheostomy in adult patients with COVID-19 is unknown. Intensive care unit(ICU) mortality as high as 42-78% has been reported in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Medical literature has not shown mortality benefit in early tracheostomy, with exceptions in traumatic brain injury and neurological injury. There is some evidence to support shorter ICU length of stay and reduced ventilator-free days with early tracheostomy. This study aims to compare tracheostomy outcomes at day 28 between COVID-19 and non- COVID-19 patients, and to assess if timing of tracheostomy from intubation impacts outcomes. Methods: A prospective single-system multi-center observational cohort study will be performed on patients who underwent percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy(PDT) for prolonged mechanical ventilation. Results: Thus far, thirty patients have undergone PDT due to respiratory failure from COVID-19 and 28 for non-COVID-19 patients. We will evaluate 28-day mortality between the two groups, as well as times to decannulation. Secondary outcomes will aim to compare ICU length of stay between the two groups, incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia(VAP) in the two groups, sequential organ failure assessment scores between the two groups, and to compare the impact of positive end expiratory pressure(PEEP) and fraction of inspired oxygen(FiO2) at the time of tracheostomy on outcomes in the two groups. We will continue to follow these patients beyond 28 days to assess any change in outcomes.Conclusions: Our study will attempt to analyze primary and secondary outcomes between COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19 patients undergoing PDT in ICU. We anticipate a higher 28-day mortality and poorer outcomes in COVID-19 patients as compared to non-COVID-19 patients. This outcome is expected on the basis of higher complication rate being reported in COVID-19 in terms of severity of acute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS) requiring prolonged prone positioning, higher PEEP and FiO2 for longer duration, thromboembolic complications, renal failure and heart failure among many others. Given longer duration required for prone positioning in COVID-19 patients, our study also anticipates later timing of tracheostomy in these patients as compared to non-COVID-19 patients. Knowing the difficulty in predicting duration of mechanical ventilation in ARDS, our study will help answer important questions like the factors that should be considered in decision-making at the time of offering PDT to these critically ill COVID-19 patients. With recent literature showing benefit of dexamethasone in COVID-19, our study will also help establish if there is a difference in the incidence of VAP between the two groups. .","Geriani, D.; Egan, J.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,,597

As of September 6, 2020, confirmed cases have risen to more than 27,000,000 worldwide and more than 885,000 people have died. Currently, no cure or standard treatment for COVID-19 exists. We conducted a prospective single-arm open-label phase II clinical trial assessing the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Convalescent plasma with sufficient total anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG titer (1:320) obtained from recovered donors was administered to adult patients with either severe or critical COVID-19 illness. Primary outcomes were adverse events in association with plasma administration, and hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included disease progression, recovery, length of stay, and hospital discharge. RESULTS: Of the 38 patients included in the analysis, 24 (63%) recovered and were discharged, and 14 (37%) died. Patients who received convalescent plasma early in the disease course (severe illness group) as compared to the patients that received convalescent plasma later in the disease progression (critical illness group) had significantly lower hospital mortality 13% vs 55% (p < 0.02) and shorter mean hospital length of stay 15.4 vs 33 days (p < 0.01). One patient experienced a transient transfusion reaction. No other adverse effects of convalescent plasma infusion were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that convalescent plasma with adequate anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titer is safe and has the potential for positive impact on clinical outcomes including recovery and survival if given to patients early in the course of COVID-19 disease.

420778,Muscle force interacts with stature to influence functionally related polar second moments of area in the lower limb among adult women,2020,"For investigating the effects of stress on the immune response of chickens, we established a corticosterone (CORT)-induced stress model by exogenous intake of CORT. Control group was fed with a basal diet and the stress model group was fed with a 30 mg/Kg CORT-treated diet in ad libitum conditions for 7 days. Then, we used RNA-seq technology to identify the expression pattern of miRNAs, target genes, and relevant pathways in chicken spleen. Results showed that 71 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) were determined, 9 of which were significantly differentially expressed miRNAs (SDEMs), and 241 target genes of DEMs were predicted. GO annotation and KEGG pathway analysis were carried out to understand the role of the DEMs. Out of 287 significantly enriched GO terms, 37 were stress- or immune-related, such as response to light stimulus, detection of oxidative stress, and immune response in mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue. Out of 85 KEGG pathways, 8 were related to stress or immunity, such as cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, JAK-STAT signaling pathway, and RLR signaling pathway. We then constructed the interaction networks between target genes from immune-related pathways and their DEMs. The analysis results suggested that some DEMs (gga-miR-17 family, gga-miR-15/16 family, gga-miR-2954 and gga-miR-34b-5p) and target genes (SIKE1, CX3CL1, IL11Ra, PIGR, and CDKN1A) were core miRNAs and genes. This study revealed the dynamic miRNA transcriptome, target genes and related pathways in chicken spleen under CORT-induced stress model, which provided a basis for studying the molecular mechanism of stress affecting immune function.","Su, Aru; Zhou, Yanting; Guo, Yujie; Yang, Xiuling; Zhang, Yanhua; Li, Wenting; Tian, Yadong; Li, Kui; Sun, Guirong; Jiang, Ruirui; Han, Ruili; Kang, Xiangtao; Yan, Fengbin",Res Vet Sci,,597

421575,Vitamin d and covid-19: A note of caution,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, is now a global pandemic affecting more than 12 million patients across 188 countries. A significant proportion of these patients require admission to intensive care units for acute hypoxic respiratory failure and are at an increased risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias. The presence of underlying comorbidities, pathophysiologic changes imposed by the disease, and concomitant polypharmacy, increase the likelihood of life-threatening arrhythmias in these patients. Supraventricular, as well as ventricular arrhythmias, are common and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. It is important to understand the interplay of various causal factors while instituting strategies to mitigate the impact of modifiable risk factors. Furthermore, avoidance and early recognition of drug interactions, along with prompt treatment, might help improve outcomes in this vulnerable patient population.","Karamchandani, Kunal; Quintili, Ashley; Landis, Terra; Bose, Somnath",J. cardiothoracic vasc. anest,,597
421675,Lessons From COVID-19 on the Stepwise Development of Interventions,2020,"This paper studies the intergenerational impact of parental job loss on school performance during the Great Recession in Spain. Collecting data through parental surveys in a school in the province of Barcelona, I obtain information about the parental labour market status before and after the Great Recession. I can then link this information to repeated information on their children's school performance, for a sample of over 300 students. Using individual fixed effects, the estimates show a negative and significant decrease on average grades of around 15% of a standard deviation after father's job loss. These results are mainly driven by those students whose fathers suffer long unemployment spells. In contrast, the average impact of mother's job loss on school performance is close to zero and non-significant. The decline in school performance during the Great Recession after father's job loss, particularly among disadvantaged students, could result in detrimental long-term effects that might contribute to increased inequality. This could be an important and underemphasised cost of recessions.","Ruiz-Valenzuela, Jenifer",SERIEs (Berl),,597

AIM: In light of these changes, the authors compared data relative to allogeneic transplants carried out from 2018 at their center before (n = 167) and during the pandemic (n = 45). METHODS: The authors examined patient characteristics, donor and graft types, cell doses and main transplant outcomes. Moreover, the authors evaluated the rise of costs attributable to additional COVID-19-related procedures as well as the risk of adverse events these procedures conveyed to grafts or recipients. RESULTS: Overall, the number of transplants did not decrease during the pandemic, whereas patients at high relapse risk were prioritized. Transplants were mainly from matched unrelated donors, with a significant decrease in haploidentical related donors. Moreover, the use of bone marrow as a graft for haploidentical transplant was almost abandoned. Cryopreservation was introduced for all related and unrelated apheresis products, with a median storage time of 20 days. Notably, transplant outcomes (engraftment, acute graft-versus-host disease and non-relapse mortality) with cryopreserved products were comparable to those with fresh products. CONCLUSIONS: Considering that the emergency situation may persist for months, cryopreserving allogeneic grafts can offer a lifesaving opportunity for patients whose allogeneic transplant cannot be postponed until after the end of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Valentini, Caterina Giovanna; Chiusolo, Patrizia; Bianchi, Maria; Metafuni, Elisabetta; Orlando, Nicoletta; Giammarco, Sabrina; Bacigalupo, Andrea; Sica, Simona; Teofili, Luciana",Cytotherapy,,597

Increased research on diagnostic tools is currently being implemented in order to assist with rapid identification of the virus, as mass diagnosis and containment is the best way to prevent the outbreak of the virus. Accordingly, there is a growing urgency to establish a point-of-care device for the rapid detection of coronavirus to prevent subsequent spread. This device needs to be sensitive, selective, and exhibit rapid diagnostic capabilities. Electrochemical biosensors have demonstrated these traits and, hence, serve as promising candidates for the detection of viruses. This review summarizes the designs and features of electrochemical biosensors developed for some past and current pandemic or epidemic viruses, including influenza, HIV, Ebola, and Zika. Alongside the design, this review also discusses the detection principles, fabrication techniques, and applications of the biosensors.

426959,Childhood Asthma and Covid 19,2020,"The HGR is a quite challenging task as its performance is influenced by various aspects such as illumination variations, cluttered backgrounds, spontaneous capture, etc. The conventional CNN networks for HGR are following two stage pipeline to deal with the various challenges: complex signs, illumination variations, complex and cluttered backgrounds. The existing approaches needs expert expertise as well as auxiliary computation at stage 1 to remove the complexities from the input images. Therefore, in this paper, we proposes an novel end-to-end compact CNN framework: fine grained feature attentive network for hand gesture recognition (Fit-Hand) to solve the challenges as discussed above. The pipeline of the proposed architecture consists of two main units: FineFeat module and dilated convolutional (Conv) layer. The FineFeat module extracts fine grained feature maps by employing attention mechanism over multiscale receptive fields. The attention mechanism is introduced to capture effective features by enlarging the average behaviour of multi-scale responses. Moreover, dilated convolution provides global features of hand gestures through a larger receptive field. In addition, integrated layer is also utilized to combine the features of FineFeat module and dilated layer which enhances the discriminability of the network by capturing complementary context information of hand postures. The effectiveness of Fit- Hand is evaluated by using subject dependent (SD) and subject independent (SI) validation setup over seven benchmark datasets: MUGD-I, MUGD-II, MUGD-III, MUGD-IV, MUGD-V, Finger Spelling and OUHANDS, respectively. Furthermore, to investigate the deep insights of the proposed Fit-Hand framework, we performed ten ablation study.","Verma, Monu; Gupta, Ayushi; Vipparthi, santosh kumar",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.07143v1.pdf,597

Using 2018 American Hospital Association data, we identified barriers to surveillance data reporting and combined this with data on the projected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospital capacity at the hospital referral region level. Our results find the most common barrier was public health agencies lacked the capacity to electronically receive data, with 41.2% of all hospitals reporting it. We also identified 31 hospital referral regions in the top quartile of projected bed capacity needed for COVID-19 patients in which over half of hospitals in the area reported that the relevant public health agency was unable to receive electronic data. Public health agencies' inability to receive electronic data is the most prominent hospital-reported barrier to effective syndromic surveillance.

To place recent findings into context, we compared symptoms and functional health status in two independent samples assessed before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Participants were recruited via an online panel using quota sampling. We assessed symptoms, functional health, and global quality of life with the EORTC QLQ-C30 in two general population samples in Spain (collected in July 2019 and April 2020). We also assessed several COVID-19 related variables, such as adherence to social distancing. RESULTS: Data from N = 1010 participants before the pandemic (mean age 47.1 years, 50.5% female) were compared with data from N = 504 participants during the pandemic (mean age 47.1 years, 50.8% female). Participants during the pandemic (vs. before the pandemic) reported lower role functioning and emotional functioning, as well as less symptom burden. A lower degree of social distancing was associated with better functional health and lower symptom burden. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate an impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on functional health and symptom burden in the Spanish general population. The comparison of before and during the pandemic can be used to benchmark results raised only during the pandemic.","Lehmann, Jens; Holzner, Bernhard; Giesinger, Johannes M; Bottomley, Andrew; Ansari, Shaad; von Butler, Ludwig; Kemmler, Georg",BMC Public Health,,597

The proposed optimization algorithm is able to determine the time and duration of social distancing policies in the country. The achieved results are based on data from the period between March and May of 2020, regarding the cumulative number of infections and deaths due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This dataset is assumably largely sub-notified due to the absence of mass testing in Brazil. Thus, the MPC is based on a SIR model which is identified using an uncertainty-weighted Least-Squares criterion. Furthermore, this model includes an additional dynamic variable that mimics the response of the population to the social distancing policies determined by the government, which affect the COVID-19 transmission rate. The proposed control method is set within a mixed-logical formalism, since the decision variable is forcefully binary (existence or the absence of social distance policy). A dwell-time constraint is included to avoid too frequent shifts between these two inputs. The achieved simulation results illustrate how such optimal control method would operate in practice, pointing out that no social distancing should be relaxed before mid August 2020. If relaxations are necessary, they should not be performed before this date and should be in small periods, no longer than 25 days. This paradigm would proceed roughly until January/2021. The results also indicate a possible second peak of infections, which has a forecast to the beginning of October. This peak can be reduced if the periods of days with relaxed social isolation measures are shortened.","Morato, Marcelo M; Bastos, Saulo B; Cajueiro, Daniel O; Normey-Rico, Julio E",Annual reviews in control,,597

Analysis of these mutations is necessary for gaining knowledge regarding different aspects of therapeutic development. Previously, we have reported a Sanger method-based genome sequence of a viral isolate named SARS-CoV-2 NIB-1, circulating in Bangladesh. The genome has four novel non-synonymous mutations in V121D, V843F, A889V, and G1691C positions. RESULTS: Using different computational tools, we have found V121D substitution has the potential to destabilize the non-structural protein-1 (NSP-1). NSP-1 inactivates the type-1 interferon-induced antiviral system. Hence, this mutant could be a basis of attenuated vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. V843F, A889V, and G1691C are all located in nonstructural protein-3 (NSP-3). G1691C can decrease the flexibility of the protein. V843F and A889V might change the binding pattern and efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PLPro) inhibitor GRL0617. V843F substitution in PLPro was the most prevalent mutation in the clinical samples. This mutation showed a reduced affinity for interferon-stimulated gene-15 protein (ISG-15) and might have an impact on innate immunity and viral spread. However, V843F+A889V double mutant exhibited the same binding affinity as wild type PLPro. A possible reason behind this phenomenon can be that V843F is a conserved residue of PLPro which damaged the protease structure, but A889V, a less conserved residue, presumably neutralized that damage. CONCLUSIONS: Mutants of NSP-1 could provide attenuated vaccines against coronavirus. Also, these mutations of PLPro might be targeted to develop better anti-SARS therapeutics. We hope our study will help to get better insides during the development of attenuated vaccine and PLPro inhibitors.","Hossain, Mohammad Uzzal; Bhattacharjee, Arittra; Emon, Md Tabassum Hossain; Chowdhury, Zeshan Mahmud; Ahammad, Ishtiaque; Mosaib, Md Golam; Moniruzzaman, Md; Rahman, Md Hadisur; Islam, Md Nazrul; Ahmed, Irfan; Amin, Md Ruhul; Rashed, Asif; Das, Keshob Chandra; Keya, Chaman Ara; Salimullah, Md",J Genet Eng Biotechnol,,597

431858,Covid reports cause trouble,2021,"We propose a theoretical model to elucidate intermolecular electrostatic interactions between a virus and a substrate. Our model treats the virus as a homogeneous particle having surface charge and the polymer fiber of the respirator as a charged plane. Electric potentials surrounding the virus and fiber are influenced by the surface charge distribution of the virus. We use Poisson-Boltzmann equations to calculate electric potentials. Then, Derjaguin's approximation and a linear superposition of the potential function are extended to determine the electrostatic force. In this work, we apply this model for coronavirus or SARS-CoV-2 case and numerical results quantitatively agree with prior simulation. We find that the influence of fiber's potential on the surface charge of the virus is important and is considered in interaction calculations to obtain better accuracy. The electrostatic interaction significantly decays with increasing separation distance, and this curve becomes steeper when adding more salt. Although the interaction force increases with heating, one can observe the repulsive-attractive transition when the environment is acidic.","Dung, D. N.; Phan, A. D.; Nguyen, T. T.; Lam, V.

The questionnaire comprised three main components: (1) demographic information, previous working experience, actual working schedule; (2) individual chronotype, either calculated by Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ); (3) self-perception of risk of medication error. RESULTS: Midwives (n = 401) responded ""yes, at least once"" to the question dealing with self-perception of risk of medication error in 48.1% of cases. Cluster analysis showed that perception of risk of medication errors was associated with class of age 31-35 years, shift work schedule, working experience 6-10 years, and Intermediate-type MEQ score. CONCLUSIONS: Perception of the risk of medication errors is present in near one out of two midwives in Italy. In particular, younger midwives with lower working experience, engaged in shift work, and belonging to an Intermediate chronotype, seem to be at higher risk of potential medication error. Since early morning hours seem to represent highest risk frame for female healthcare workers, shift work is not always aligned with individual circadian preference.

433060,The Impact of COVID-19 on Pulmonary Fellowship Training in an Irish Setting,2020,"Host nutrition is an important factor affecting disease progression. Selenium (Se) is an essential trace element for the human body with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and immune effects, and Se deficiency increases RNA-virus replication and virulent mutations, which lead to more severe tissue damage and symptoms. Low Se status in the host may be an important cause of health complications induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this article, we describe the metabolic mechanisms by which Se is involved in anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and immune effects, and review the role and clinical effects of Se in viral infection. We then discuss the potential relationship between Se and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The association between soil Se level and the incidence of COVID-19 was observed in different cities of Hubei Province. The incidence of COVID-19 was more than 10 times lower in Se-enriched cities (Enshi, Shiyan, and Xiangyang) than in Se-deficient cities (Suizhou and Xiaogan). Although the relationship between soil Se levels and the incidence of COVID-19 in Hubei still needs further study, these findings provide baseline information demonstrating the effect of Se levels on SARS-CoV-2, which could contribute to the prevention and management of COVID-19.","Liu, Qiyuan; Zhao, Xiaoli; Ma, Jin; Mu, Yunsong; Wang, Ying; Yang, Shuhui; Wu, Yihang; Wu, Fengchang; Zhou, Yongzhang",Environ Res,,597
433061,The Impact of COVID-19 on Pulmonary Fellowship Training in an Irish Setting,2020,"PURPOSE: To describe the usefulness of an innovative ""semi-real-time"" pharmacy dashboard in managing workload during the unpredictable coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. SUMMARY: We created a pharmacy dashboard to monitor workload and key performance indicators during the dynamic COVID-19 crisis. The dashboard accessed the prescribing workload from our clinical information system and filled prescriptions from robotic prescription dispensing systems. The aggregated data was visualized using modern tools. The dashboard presents performance data in near real time and is updated every 15 minutes. After validation during the early weeks of the COVID-19 crisis, the dashboard provided reliable data and served as a great decision support aid in calculating the backlog of prescribed but unfilled prescriptions. It also aided in adjusting manpower, identifying prescribing and dispensing patterns, identifying trends, and diverting staff resources to appropriate locations. The dashboard has been useful in clearing the backlog in a timely manner, staff planning, and predicting the next coming surge so that we can proactively minimize accumulation of backlogged prescriptions. CONCLUSION: Developing a dynamic, semi-real-time pharmacy dashboard during unstable circumstances such as those that have arisen during the COVID-19 pandemic can be very useful in ambulatory care pharmacy workload management.","Al-Jazairi, Abdulrazaq S; Horanieh, Bashar K; Alswailem, Osama A",Am. j. health system pharm,,597

Wearing of masks and social distancing can significantly decrease transmission and spread, however, due to circumstances such as medical or dental intervention and personal choice these practices have not been universally adopted. Additional strategies are required to lessen transmission. Nasal rinses and mouthwashes, which directly impact the major sites of reception and transmission of human coronaviruses (HCoV), may provide an additional level of protection against the virus. Common over-the-counter nasal rinses and mouthwashes/gargles were tested for their ability to inactivate high concentrations of HCoV using contact times of 30 s, 1 min, and 2 min. Reductions in titers were measured by using the tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50 ) assay. A 1% baby shampoo nasal rinse solution inactivated HCoV greater than 99.9% with a 2-min contact time. Several over-the-counter mouthwash/gargle products including Listerine and Listerine-like products were highly effective at inactivating infectious virus with greater than 99.9% even with a 30-s contact time. In the current manuscript we have demonstrated that several commonly available healthcare products have significant virucidal properties with respect to HCoV.","Meyers, Craig; Robison, Richard; Milici, Janice; Alam, Samina; Quillen, David; Goldenberg, David; Kass, Rena",J Med Virol,,597

A cross-sectional study was conducted among undergraduate medical and dental students of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. Four hundred and twenty students who attended anatomy classes during COVID-19 outbreak in Greece, were asked to fill in a questionnaire of 22 questions evaluating the formats of the different courses provided. Each student was asked to complete the questionnaire anonymously via the Google Forms® platform. A total of 200 students participated. During the lockdown, 59.5% of students attended all online anatomy lectures compared to 44.5% in the pre-pandemic year. Overall, the higher percentage of 73.5% was satisfied with the traditional anatomy teaching, instead of 56% which were satisfied with the effectiveness of online anatomy lectures. Asking whether any remote educational method can partially or completely replace the traditional anatomy teaching, the majority of students replied ""no"" for all the three remote modalities. The traditional anatomy teaching remains the most preferred and effective teaching modality. The students ranked online anatomy lectures and pre-recorded anatomy lectures in second place in terms of effectiveness and preference. The development of remote learning methods has increased students' active participation in anatomy lessons, but significantly negatively affected the students' performance at exams. Remote learning cannot replace the traditional anatomy teaching method, but online lectures could be incorporated into anatomy curricula as an additional tool.","Totlis, Trifon; Tishukov, Maksim; Piagkou, Maria; Kostares, Michael; Natsis, Konstantinos",,,597

Our aim was to assess the frequency of gastrointestinal (GI) involvement in COVID-19. Patients and methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of all studies reporting clinical data about COVID-19 patients, published until 25th March 2020. The primary endpoint was the pooled prevalence of COVID-19 patients complaining of GI symptoms. Secondary endpoints were the pooled prevalence of cases with COVID-19 positive stool samples, and of asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. We used random-effects model for meta-analysis. Results: Thirty-three studies were included in the meta-analysis. Out of 4434 COVID-19 patients, the pooled prevalence of GI manifestations was 11.51% (95% CI : 8.16 to 15.35). The most frequent GI symptom was diarrhea (7.78% of cases ; 95% CI : 5.05 to 11.04), followed by nausea/vomiting (3.57% ; 95% CI : 1.87 to 5.80), poor appetite (2.39% ; 95%CI : 0.55 ; 5.46) and abdominal pain (0.78% ; 95% CI : 0.26 to 1.57). Positivity for COVID-19 in stool samples was observed in 41.50% (95% CI : 17.70 to 67.65) of cases. 11.85% (95% CI : 3.53 to 24.17) of COVID-19 patients remained asymptomatic. Conclusions: The present meta-analysis shows that a significant proportion of COVID-19 patients suffer from GI manifestations, as well as COVID-19 positivity in stool samples. Asymptomatic patients need to be considered a further potential route of viral transmission.","Merola, E; Armelao, F; de Pretis, G",Acta Gastroenterol Belg,,597

436779,A Growing Educational Divide in the COVID-19 Economy Is Especially Pronounced among Parents,2021,"Lockdown measures to control the spread of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) sharply limited energy consumption and carbon emissions. The lockdown effect on carbon emissions has been studied by many researchers using statistical approaches. However, the lockdown effect on atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) on an urban scale remains unclear. Here we present CO2 concentration and carbon isotopic (Î´13C) measurements to assess the impact of COVID-19 control measures on atmospheric CO2 in Xi'an, China. We find that CO2 concentrations during the lockdown period were 7.5% lower than during the normal period (prior to the Spring Festival, 25 Jan to 4 Feb 2020). The observed CO2excess (total CO2 minus background CO2) during the lockdown period was 52.3% lower than that during the normal period, and 35.7% lower than the estimated CO2excess with the effect of weather removed. A Keeling plot shows that in contrast CO2 concentrations and Î´13C were weakly correlated (R2=0.18) during the lockdown period, reflecting a change in CO2 sources imposed by the curtailment of traffic and industrial emissions. Our study also show that the sharp reduction in atmospheric CO2 during lockdown were short-lived, and returned to normal levels within months after lockdown measures were lifted.","Wu, Shugang; Zhou, Weijian; Xiong, Xiaohu; Burr, G S; Cheng, Peng; Wang, Peng; Niu, Zhenchuan; Hou, Yaoyao",Environ Res,,597

Compared to the same period in 2017-2019, the daily O3 mean concentrations increased at urban stations by 24% in Nice, 14% in Rome, 27% in Turin, 2.4% in Valencia and 36% in Wuhan during the lockdown in 2020. This increase in O3 concentrations is mainly explained by an unprecedented reduction in NOx emissions leading to a lower O3 titration by NO. Strong reductions in NO2 mean concentrations were observed in all European cities, ~53% at urban stations, comparable to Wuhan (57%), and ~65% at traffic stations. NO declined even further, ~63% at urban stations and ~78% at traffic stations in Europe. Reductions in PM2.5 and PM10 at urban stations were overall much smaller both in magnitude and relative change in Europe (~8%) than in Wuhan (~42%). The PM reductions due to limiting transportation and fuel combustion in institutional and commercial buildings were partly offset by increases of PM emissions from the activities at home in some of the cities. The NOx concentrations during the lockdown were on average 49% lower than those at weekends of the previous years in all cities. The lockdown effect on O3 production was ~10% higher than the weekend effect in Southern Europe and 38% higher in Wuhan, while for PM the lockdown had the same effect as weekends in Southern Europe (~6% of difference). This study highlights the challenge of reducing the formation of secondary pollutants such as O3 even with strict measures to control primary pollutant emissions. These results are relevant for designing abatement policies of urban pollution.","Sicard, Pierre; De Marco, Alessandra; Agathokleous, Evgenios; Feng, Zhaozhong; Xu, Xiaobin; Paoletti, Elena; Rodriguez, José Jaime Diéguez; Calatayud, Vicent",Sci Total Environ,,597

However, there are only few established PA protocols on how to use such platforms. Hence, the purposes of this study were to (a) design an online PA protocol and (b) explore its feasibility among older adults during a quarantine. A group of exercise specialists developed a PA protocol while accounting for challenges that may arise when using a video-conferencing platform (""Zoom""). A special focus was placed on safety, individualization, and motivational aspects. Then, 31 community dwelling older adults (71.5 ± 4 years) were recruited via social media to follow this protocol twice a week for 8 weeks. Outcome measures included adverse events, adherence rates, and satisfaction with the protocol, its delivery, and technological aspects. Twenty-eight participants completed the protocol. No adverse events occurred, and adherence rates were high (90%). Most participants (97%) indicated they would participate in such a program in the future and highly rated all aspects of the protocol (median score >6 in 1-7 Likert scales). The PA protocol delivered live via a video-conferencing platform was found to be safe and feasible with this cohort. It can therefore be implemented in practice, and in future studies planning to utilize home-based PA sessions for older adults.","Schwartz, Hadar; Har-Nir, Itai; Wenhoda, Tamar; Halperin, Israel",Translational behavioral medicine (Internet),,597

In this study, we developed a localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) aptasensor based on polyethylene-glycol(PEG)-free gold nanorods (AuNRs) for the wide-range and direct detection of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3. The surfactant on AuNRs was removed by exchanging with polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) instead of PEG then the PSS was exchanged with citrate. By exchanging the stabilizer of AuNRs from PEG to PEG-free (i.e., citrate), the sensing efficiency of LSPR aptasensor was significantly improved. Additionally, LSPR aptasensor was functionalized with aptamer and blocking agent to enhance the sensing performance. The LSPR aptasensor achieved the direct, highly sensitive, and selective detection of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 over a wide concentration range (0.1-105 ng/mL), with a limit of detection of 0.1 ng/mL.

438420,The Dermatologist's Perspective: Why is COVID-19 mortality lower in females than males?,2020,"BACKGROUND: A central component of the public health strategy to control the COVID-19 pandemic involves encouraging mask wearing and social distancing to protect individuals from acquiring and transmitting the virus. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand the psychological factors that drive adoption or rejection of these protective behaviors, which can inform public health interventions to control the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted an online survey of a representative sample of 1074 US adults and assessed three novel potential predictors of COVID-19 behaviors: trait reactance, COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs, and COVID-19 apocalypse beliefs. Key outcomes (dependent variables) included an index of COVID-19 protective behaviors, the number of trips taken from the home, and COVID-19 knowledge. RESULTS: In bivariate analyses, all three predictors were significantly correlated in the hypothesized direction with the three COVID-19 outcomes. Specifically, each predictor was negatively (P<.01) correlated with the COVID-19 protective behaviors index and COVID-19 knowledge score, and positively correlated with trips taken from home per week (more of which was considered higher risk). COVID-19 protective behaviors and COVID-19 knowledge were significantly lower in the top median compared to the bottom median for all three predictors. In general, these findings remained significant after adjusting for all novel predictors plus age, gender, income, education, race, political party, and religiosity. Self-identified Republicans (vs other political affiliations) reported the highest values for each of the novel predictors. CONCLUSIONS: This study can inform the development of health communication interventions to encourage the adoption of COVID-19 protective behaviors. Interestingly, we found that higher scores of all three novel predictors were associated with lower COVID-19 knowledge, suggesting that lack of an accurate understanding of the virus may be driving some of these attitudes; although, it is also possible that these attributes may interfere with one's willingness or ability to seek and absorb accurate health information. These individuals may be particularly immune to accepting new information and yielding their beliefs. Health communication professionals may apply lessons learned from countering similar beliefs around climate change and vaccine hesitancy. Messages designed for individuals prone to reactance may be more effective if they minimize controlling language and emphasize the individual's independence in adopting these behavioral recommendations. Messaging for those who possess conspiracy beliefs should similarly not assume that providing evidence contrary to these beliefs will alone alter behavior. Other communication techniques such as rolling with resistance, a strategy used in motivational interviewing, may be helpful. Messaging for those with apocalyptic beliefs may require using religious leaders as the message source and using scripture that would support the adoption of COVID-19 protection behaviors.","Resnicow, Ken; Bacon, Elizabeth; Yang, Penny; Hawley, Sarah; Van Horn, M Lee; An, Lawrence",J Med Internet Res,,597

Of 134 patients admitted at COVID hospital of Policlinico-University of Bari, 86 (58 men age 67.6 ± 12.4 and 28 women age 65.7 ± 15.4) fulfilled the inclusion criteria: in particular, 80 patients (93%) showed prodromal symptoms (smell and/or taste dysfunctions) and other typical clinical manifestations and 19 died (13 men age 73.4 ± 7.7 and 6 women age 74.8 ± 6.7). 48 patients were excluded because 13 finished chemotherapy and 6 radiotherapy recently, 5 presented suspected breast carcinoma, 5 suspected lung carcinoma, 6 suspected ovarian carcinoma or ovary cyst, 1 cystic fibrosis, 3 renal fibrosis and 9 were affected by autoimmune diseases in treatment with monoclonal antibodies. The venous sample was taken for each patient on the admission and during the hospital stay. For each patient, six measurements relating to considered parameters were performed. Significant correlations between He4 and IL-6 levels (r = 0.797), between He4 and PSP (r = 0.621), between He4 and PCT (r = 0.447), between He4 and D-Dimer (r = 0.367), between He4 and RCP (r = 0.327) have been found. ROC curves analysis showed an excellent accuracy for He4 (AUC = 0.92) and IL-6 (AUC = 0.91), a very good accuracy for PSP (AUC = 0.81), a good accuracy for PCT (AUC = 0.701) and D-Dimer (AUC = 0.721) and sufficient accuracy for RCP (AUC = 0.616). These results demonstrated the important correlation between He4, IL6 and PSP, an excellent accuracy of He4 and IL6 and showed a probable role of He4 in the innate immunity in particularly at the level of oral cavity, nasopharynx and respiratory tract. Besides He4 together with IL6 might be involved in the onset of smell and/or taste disorders and it might be used as innovative biomarker to monitor clinical evolution of COVID-19 because He4 could indicate a multi-organ involvement.","Schirinzi, Annalisa; Cazzolla, Angela Pia; Lovero, Roberto; Lo Muzio, Lorenzo; Testa, Nunzio Francesco; Ciavarella, Domenico; Palmieri, Giuseppe; Pozzessere, Pietro; Procacci, Vito; Di Serio, Francesca; Santacroce, Luigi",,,597

Background: Interprofessional collaboration is elementary in the intensive care unit, a success factor in difficult patient situations and complex therapies. The COVID-19-pandemic challenged newly composed treatment teams, however, experience does not exist. Aim: We analyzed personal experiences and views on inter- and intraprofessional collaboration in intensive care units during the COVID-19-pandemic and identified influencing factors. Methods: We used a qualitative, retrospective study design, collected data from physicians, nurses in intensive care, anesthesia and surgery and physiotherapists during group discussions using the story / dialogue method. We analyzed the data according to Mayring's Qualitative content analysis. Results: We identified two main categories, each with three sub-categories: 1. Mastering a exceptional situation actively (Recognizing a common goal; Acting in solidarity; Getting to know each other in inter- / intraprofessional collaboration), 2. Having overcome the exceptional situation in retrospect (Maintaining personal contacts; Gaining new knowledge and perspectives; Taking what has been learned into the future). The participants rated the interprofessional and intraprofessional collaboration as good to very good. Conclusions: Factors promoting collaboration and positive experiences are to be incorporated into everyday work. The intraprofessional management team thereby defines common goals and values for the best possible patient care.","Fröhlich, Martin R; Rettke, Horst; Conca, Antoinette; Boden, Karsten",Pflege,,597

438804,"Covid-19: Facemasks, Healthcare Policies and Risk Factors in the Crucial Initial Months of a Global Pandemic",2020,"INTRODUCTION: Increasing evidence indicate that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is companied by renal dysfunction. However, the association of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced renal dysfunction with prognosis remains obscure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All 154 patients with COVID-19 were recruited from the Second People's Hospital of Fuyang City in Anhui, China. Demographic characteristics and laboratory data were extracted. Renal dysfunction was evaluated and its prognosis was followed up based on a retrospective cohort study. RESULTS: There were 125 (81.2%) mild and 29 (18.8%) severe cases in 154 COVID-19 patients. On admission, 16 (10.4%) subjects were accompanied with renal dysfunction. Serum creatinine and cystatin C were increased and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was decreased in severe patients compared with those in mild patients. Renal dysfunction was more prevalent in severe patients. Using multivariate logistic regression, we found that male gender, older age and hypertension were three importantly independent risk factors for renal dysfunction in COVID-19 patients. Follow-up study found that at least one renal function marker of 3.33% patients remained abnormal in 2 weeks after discharge. CONCLUSION: Male elderly COVID-19 patients with hypertension elevates the risk of renal dysfunction. SARS-CoV-2-induced renal dysfunction are not fully recovered in 2 weeks after discharge.","Xiang, Hui-Xian; Fei, Jun; Xiang, Ying; Xu, Zheng; Zheng, Ling; Li, Xiu-Yong; Fu, Lin; Zhao, Hui",BMC Infect Dis,,597

439806,Lung ultrasound: The future ahead and the lessons learned from COVID-19,2020,"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) exhibit training pathologies that can lead to convergence-related degenerative behaviors, whereas spatially-distributed, coevolutionary algorithms (CEAs) for GAN training, e.g. Lipizzaner, are empirically robust to them. The robustness arises from diversity that occurs by training populations of generators and discriminators in each cell of a toroidal grid. Communication, where signals in the form of parameters of the best GAN in a cell propagate in four directions: North, South, West, and East, also plays a role, by communicating adaptations that are both new and fit. We propose Lipi-Ring, a distributed CEA like Lipizzaner, except that it uses a different spatial topology, i.e. a ring. Our central question is whether the different directionality of signal propagation (effectively migration to one or more neighbors on each side of a cell) meets or exceeds the performance quality and training efficiency of Lipizzaner Experimental analysis on different datasets (i.e, MNIST, CelebA, and COVID-19 chest X-ray images) shows that there are no significant differences between the performances of the trained generative models by both methods. However, Lipi-Ring significantly reduces the computational time (14.2%. . . 41.2%). Thus, Lipi-Ring offers an alternative to Lipizzaner when the computational cost of training matters.","Toutouh, Jamal; O'Reilly, Una-May",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.08929v1.pdf,597
439916,Is the grass really greener on the other side? - The COVID-free 'green zones' in the COVID-19 era,2020,"BACKGROUND: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, a critical care outreach team was implemented in our hospital to guarantee multidisciplinary patient assessment at admission and prompt ICU support in medical wards. In this paper, we report the activity plan results and describe the baseline characteristics of the referred subjects. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated data from 125 subjects referred to the critical care outreach team from March 22 to April 22, 2020. We considered subjects with a ceiling of care decision, with those deemed eligible assigned to level 3 care (ward subgroup), and those deemed ineligible admitted to the ICU (ICU subgroup). Quality indicators of the outreach team plan delivery included number of cardiac arrest calls, number of intubations in level 2 areas, and ineffective palliative support. RESULTS: We enrolled 125 consecutive adult subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. We did not report any emergency endotracheal intubations in the clinical ward. In the care ceiling subgroup, we had 2 (3.3%) emergency calls for cardiac arrest, whereas signs of ineffective palliative support were reported in 5 subjects (12.5%). Noninvasive forms of respiratory assistance were delivered to 40.0% of subjects in the ward subgroup (median 3 d [interquartile range (IQR) 2-5]), to 45.9% of subjects in the care ceiling subgroup (median 5 d [IQR 3-7]), and to 64.7% of subjects in the ICU subgroup (median 2.5 d [IQR 1-3]). Thirty of the 31 ward subjects (96.7%), 26 of the 34 ICU subjects, (76.4%), and 19 of the 61 ceiling of care subjects (31.1%) were discharged. CONCLUSIONS: In the context of a hospital and ICU surge, a multidisciplinary daily plan supported by a dedicated critical care outreach team was associated with a low rate of cardiac arrest calls, no emergency intubations in the ward, and appropriate palliative care support for subjects with a ceiling of care decision.","Messina, Antonio; Pradella, Andrea; Alicino, Valeria; Neganov, Maxim; Mattei, Giacomo De; Coppalini, Giacomo; Negri, Katerina; Costantini, Elena; Protti, Alessandro; Azzolini, Elena; Ciccarelli, Michele; Aghemo, Alessio; Voza, Antonio; Greco, Massimiliano; Lagioia, Michele; Cecconi, Maurizio",Respir Care,,597

We aimed to explore the association between the pandemic-related product shortages and psychological distress in people with GI disorders. METHODS: This online cross-sectional survey was nested within an ongoing, international, prospective study of well-being in people with GI disorders. The study was advertised in multiple countries in May-September 2020 via patient organizations and social media. The primary outcome measure was distress, evaluated by the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale. We utilized linear regressions, adjusting for covariates and testing individual moderation effects. KEY RESULTS: Overall, 831 people completed the survey from 27 countries, of whom 82% were female (mean age = 49 years). The most common disorders included inflammatory bowel disease (n = 322), celiac disease (n = 273), and irritable bowel syndrome (n = 260). Significant problems accessing food were reported by 19.8%, non-medical therapies by 16%, toilet paper by 10.8%, and essential medication by 8.9% of the sample (>5% pain medication). There was a positive association between toilet paper and pain medication shortages and distress, and a negative association between food shortages and distress. Significant moderation effects were identified for COVID-19 prevalence and toilet paper and food shortages, and between COVID-19 fear and pain medication shortages. CONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES: The study documented a significant relationship between product shortages and psychological distress, which were associated with COVID-19 prevalence and fear. Strategies addressing COVID-19 fear could potentially modify the relationship between shortages and distress.","Mikocka-Walus, Antonina; Skvarc, David; van Tilburg, Miranda A L; Barreiro-de Acosta, Manuel; Bennebroek Evertsz, Floor; Bernstein, Charles N; Burisch, Johan; Ferreira, Nuno; Gearry, Richard B; Graff, Lesley A; Jedel, Sharon; Mokrowiecka, Anna; Stengel, Andreas; Knowles, Simon",Neurogastroenterol Motil,,597

This study aimed to quantify changes in vitamin D level among infants and toddlers in Hong Kong after the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: We recruited 303 infants and toddlers aged 2-24 months by stratified random sampling from 1 June 2019 to November 30, 2020. Regression models were used to estimate the effect of time on infants' serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) level overall and by age groups before and after the outbreak. Interrupted time series (ITS) analysis was performed to examine the sustained effect of COVID-19 on their serum 25(OH)D level. Results: The ITS results showed no immediate reduction in serum 25(OH)D level among infants, but a decreasing trend was observed in the subsequent months post-outbreak at a monthly decline rate of -6.32 nmol/L. When analyzed by age group, the magnitude of post-outbreak reduction in 25(OH)D was stronger among younger infants (aged 2-6 months). Conclusion: Guidelines and recommendations should be given to pregnant women and mothers to ensure sufficient vitamin D level in their infants during the COVID-19 period.","Wong, Rosa S; Tung, Keith T S; So, Hung-Kwan; Wong, Wilfred H S; Wong, Siew Yan; Tsang, Hing Wai; Tung, Joanna Y L; Chua, Gilbert T; Ho, Marco H K; Wong, Ian C K; Ip, Patrick",Nutrients,,597

Tear secretion, tear break-up time and corneal staining were measured. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A preclinical and short-term prospective study was performed. Twenty New Zealand white rabbits were divided into five groups, with four rabbits per group, each receiving a different concentration of Artemia salina. In each rabbit, an extract of Artemia salina (2%, 4%, 6%, 8% or 10%) was randomly instilled in one eye and saline solution (negative control) in the other eye. Tear secretion, tear break-up time and corneal staining were measured before and after the instillation of five drops per eye (one drop per hour) on the same day. RESULTS: In tear secretion, there was an increase of 43.88 ± 6.73% with 4% Artemia salina in comparison with its baseline measurement (P = .049). The rest of the groups did not show differences (P &#8805; 0.05). For tear break-up time, none of the groups showed differences (P &#8805; 0.05), while for corneal staining score, there was an improvement of 0.88 ± 0.83 with 4% Artemia salina (P = .038) and a deterioration of 0.50 ± 0.83 with control solution (P = .008). CONCLUSIONS: Short-term instillation of eye drops with 4% Artemia salina produced both stimulation of tear secretion and a slight improvement of physiological corneal staining. Besides, all the doses of up to 10% Artemia salina did not produce undesirable side effects on the ocular surface. Therefore, these eye drops are presented as a possible new treatment for dry eye due to their secretagogue properties and ocular surface regeneration.","Carpena-Torres, Carlos; Pintor, Jesús; Huete-Toral, Fernando; Rodriguez-Pomar, Candela; Martínez-Águila, Alejandro; Carracedo, Gonzalo",Curr Eye Res,,597

As with other viral infections, such as rubella, influenza, and cytomegalovirus, SARS-CoV-2 induces a surge of proinflammatory cytokines that affect microglial function, which can be harmful to brain development. Along with the viral induction of neuroinflammation, other noninfectious conditions may interact to produce additional inflammation, such as the nutritional imbalance of fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids and alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Additionally, transient thyrotoxicosis induced by SARS-CoV-2 with secondary autoimmune hypothyroidism has been reported, which could go undetected during pregnancy. Together, those factors may pose additional risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection impacting mechanisms of neural development such as synaptic pruning and neural circuitry formation. The present review discusses those conditions in the perspective of the understanding of risk factors that should be considered and the possible emergence of neurodevelopmental disorders in COVID-19-infected children.","da Silva Chagas, Luana; Sandre, Poliana Capucho; de Velasco, Patricia Coelho; Marcondes, Henrique; Ribeiro E Ribeiro, Natalia Cristina Aparecida; Barreto, Aline Loureiro; Alves Mauro, Luiza Beatriz; Ferreira, Julia Huber; Serfaty, Claudio A",Neuroimmunomodulation,,597
443650,COVID-19 outbreak and acute cholecystitis in a Hub Hospital in Milan: wider indications for percutaneous cholecystostomy,2021,"The purpose of the present work is to provide a complete overview of possible direct/indirect implications on the quality of aquatic compartments due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. With this aim, the environmental impacts are mainly related to i) the virus persistence in sewage and wastewaters, and ii) possible fate in aquatic compartments of drugs tested and administered to SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Because SARS-CoV-2 spread is very recent, and there is a lack of specific studies on this strain, the virus persistence in wastewaters, the parameters influencing the persistence, as well as the detection methodologies are referenced to the general coronaviruses group. However, the present detailed report of up-to-date knowledge on this topic can provide a useful source for further studies focusing on more deepened investigations of SARS-CoV-2 behaviour in the environment. Such a perspective is significant not only for the control of virus diffusion but also represents a crucial point for the identification of produced alteration to the environmental quality.","Race, M; Ferraro, A; Galdiero, E; Guida, M; Núñez-Delgado, A; Pirozzi, F; Siciliano, A; Fabbricino, M",Environ Res,,597

Social capital is a measure of social trust, belonging, and participation. This study aimed to investigate the effects of social capital on sleep quality and the mechanisms involved in people who self-isolated at home for 14 days in January 2020 during the COVID-19 epidemic in central China. MATERIAL AND METHODS Individuals (n=170) who self-isolated at home for 14 days in central China, completed self-reported questionnaires on the third day of isolation. Individual social capital was assessed using the Personal Social Capital Scale 16 (PSCI-16) questionnaire. Anxiety was assessed using the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) questionnaire, stress was assessed using the Stanford Acute Stress Reaction (SASR) questionnaire, and sleep was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire. Path analysis was performed to evaluate the relationships between a dependent variable (social capital) and two or more independent variables, using Pearson's correlation analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM). RESULTS Low levels of social capital were associated with increased levels of anxiety and stress, but increased levels of social capital were positively associated with increased quality of sleep. Anxiety was associated with stress and reduced sleep quality, and the combination of anxiety and stress reduced the positive effects of social capital on sleep quality. CONCLUSIONS During a period of individual self-isolation during the COVID-19 virus epidemic in central China, increased social capital improved sleep quality by reducing anxiety and stress.","Xiao, Han; Zhang, Yan; Kong, Desheng; Li, Shiyue; Yang, Ningxi",Med Sci Monit,,597
445056,Methanol Poisoning Emerging as the Result of COVID-19 Outbreak; Radiologic Perspective,2020,"Since March 2020, many countries around the world have been experiencing a large outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Because there is a higher rate of contact between humans in cities with higher population weighted densities, Covid-19 spreads faster in these areas. In this study, we examined the relationship between population weighted density and the spread of Covid-19. Using data from Turkey, we calculated the elasticity of Covid-19 spread with respect to population weighted density to be 0.67 after controlling for other factors. In addition to the density, the proportion of people over 65, the per capita GDP, and the number of total health care workers in each city positively contributed to the case numbers, while education level and temperature had a negative effect. We suggested a policy measure on how to transfer health care workers from different areas to the areas with a possibility of wide spread.","Baser, Onur",Health policy,,597

Dysfunction of the vascular endothelium due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been implicated in the pathogenesis of the COVID-19 vasculopathy. Although initial reports suggested that endothelial injury was caused directly by the virus, recent studies indicate that endothelial cells do not express angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the receptor that SARS-CoV-2 uses to gain entry into cells, or express it at low levels and are resistant to the infection. These new findings, together with the observation that COVID-19 triggers a cytokine storm capable of injuring the endothelium and disrupting its antithrombogenic properties, favor an indirect mechanism of endothelial injury mediated locally by an augmented inflammatory reaction to infected nonendothelial cells, such as the bronchial and alveolar epithelium, and systemically by the excessive immune response to infection. Herein we review the vascular pathology of COVID-19 and critically discuss the potential mechanisms of endothelial injury in this disease.","Nicosia, Roberto F; Ligresti, Giovanni; Caporarello, Nunzia; Akilesh, Shreeram; Ribatti, Domenico",Am J Pathol,,597

446645,"Muslim Barbers of South Malabar and Covid-19: Homogamy, caste occupation and economic hardship",2021,"BACKGROUND: Aleutian mink disease virus (AMDV) causes major economic losses in fur-bearing animal production. The control of most AMDV outbreaks is complex due to the difficulties of establishing the source of infection based only on the available on-farm epidemiological data. In this sense, phylogenetic analysis of the strains present in a farm may help elucidate the origin of the infection and improve the control and biosecurity measures. OBJECTIVES: This study had the following aims: characterize the AMDV strains from most outbreaks produced at Spanish farms between 2012-2019 at the molecular level, and assess the utility of the combined use of molecular and epidemiological data to track the possible routes of infection. METHODS: Thirty-seven strains from 17 farms were partially sequenced for the NS1 and VP2 genes and analyzed phylogenetically with other strains described worldwide. RESULTS: Spanish AMDV strains are clustered in four major clades that generally show a good geographical correlation, confirming that most had been established in Spain a long time ago. The combined study of phylogenetic results and epidemiological information of each farm suggests that most of the AMDV outbreaks since 2012 had been produced by within-farm reservoirs, while a few of them may have been due to the introduction of the virus through international trade. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of phylogenetic inference, together with epidemiological data, helps assess the possible origin of AMDV infections in mink farms and improving the control and prevention of this disease.","Prieto, Alberto; Fernández-Antonio, Ricardo; López-Lorenzo, Gonzalo; Díaz-Cao, José Manuel; López-Novo, Cynthia; Remesar, Susana; Panadero, Rosario; Díaz, Pablo; Morrondo, Patrocinio; Díez-Baños, Pablo; Fernández, Gonzalo",J Vet Sci,,597

This document provides best practice statements and recommendations for consultative management based on a systematic review and meta-analysis of international data on GI and liver manifestations of COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search to identify published and unpublished studies using OVID Medline and preprint servers (medRxiv, LitCovid, and SSRN) up until April 5, 2020; major journal sites were monitored for US publications until April 19, 2020. We pooled the prevalence of diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, as well as liver function tests abnormalities, using a fixed-effect model and assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) framework. RESULTS: We identified 118 studies and used a hierarchal study selection process to identify unique cohorts. We performed a meta-analysis of 47 studies including 10,890 unique patients. Pooled prevalence estimates of GI symptoms were as follows: diarrhea 7.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.2%-8.2%), nausea/vomiting 7.8% (95% CI, 7.1%-8.5%), and abdominal pain 2.7% (95% CI, 2.0%-3.4%). Most studies reported on hospitalized patients. The pooled prevalence estimates of elevated liver abnormalities were as follows: aspartate transaminase 15.0% (95% CI, 13.6%-16.5%) and alanine transaminase 15.0% (95% CI, 13.6%-16.4%). When we compared studies from China to studies from other countries in subgroup analyses, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, and liver abnormalities were more prevalent outside of China, with diarrhea reported in 18.3% (95% CI, 16.6%-20.1%). Isolated GI symptoms were reported rarely. We also summarized the Gl and liver adverse effects of the most commonly utilized medications for COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: GI symptoms are associated with COVID-19 in <10% of patients. In studies outside of China, estimates are higher. Further studies are needed with standardized GI symptoms questionnaires and liver function test checks on admission to better quantify and qualify the association of these symptoms with COVID-19. Based on findings from our meta-analysis, we provide several Best Practice Statements for the consultative management of COVID-19.","Sultan, Shahnaz; Altayar, Osama; Siddique, Shazia M; Davitkov, Perica; Feuerstein, Joseph D; Lim, Joseph K; Falck-Ytter, Yngve; El-Serag, Hashem B",Gastroenterology,,597

For this, word association thematic analysis (WATA) was applied to English-language vaccine-related tweets from eight countries gathered between 5 December 2020 and 21 March 2021. The method was able to quickly identify multiple international differences. Whilst some were irrelevant, potentially non-trivial differences include differing extents to which non-government scientific experts are important to national vaccination discussions. For example, Ireland seemed to be the only country in which university presidents were widely tweeted about in vaccine discussions. India's vaccine kindness term #VaccineMaitri was another interesting difference, highlighting the need for international sharing.","Thelwall, Mike",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14125v1.pdf,597

A Quantitative Analysis of CO2 Environmental Dispersion Using Different Devices,2021,"Grincamycins (GCNs) are a class of angucycline glycosides isolated from actinomycete Streptomyces strains that have potent antitumor activities, but their antitumor mechanisms remain unknown. In this study, we tried to identify the cellular target of grincamycin B (GCN B), one of most dominant and active secondary metabolites, using a combined strategy. We showed that GCN B-selective-induced apoptosis of human acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cell line NB4 through increase of ER stress and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. Using a strategy of combining phenotype, transcriptomics and protein microarray approaches, we identified that isocitrate dehydrogenase 1(IDH1) was the putative target of GCN B, and confirmed that GCNs were a subset of selective inhibitors targeting both wild-type and mutant IDH1 in vitro. It is well-known that IDH1 converts isocitrate to 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG), maintaining intracellular 2-OG homeostasis. IDH1 and its mutant as the target of GCN B were validated in NB4 cells and zebrafish model. Knockdown of IDH1 in NB4 cells caused the similar phenotype as GCN B treatment, and supplementation of N-acetylcysteine partially rescued the apoptosis caused by IDH1 interference in NB4 cells. In zebrafish model, GCN B effectively restored myeloid abnormality caused by overexpression of mutant IDH1(R132C). Taken together, we demonstrate that IDH1 is one of the antitumor targets of GCNs, suggesting wild-type IDH1 may be a potential target for hematological malignancies intervention in the future.","Wang, Zheng; Li, Zeng-Xia; Zhao, Wen-Cao; Huang, Hong-Bo; Wang, Jia-Qi; Zhang, Hao; Lu, Jun-Yan; Wang, Rui-Na; Li, Wei; Cheng, Zhao; Xu, Wen-Long; Zhou, Li-Sha; Jiang, Wei; Yu, Long; Liu, Jun-Yan; Luo, Cheng; Zhu, Heng; Pan, Wei-Jun; Ju, Jian-Hua; Dang, Yong-Jun",Acta pharmacol.

Using a novel Monte Carlo simulation procedure to perform estimation, our results reveal substantial racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19-attributable YPLL across states, with a prevailing pattern of non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics experiencing disproportionately high and non-Hispanic Whites experiencing disproportionately low COVID-19-attributable YPLL. Furthermore, estimated disparities are generally more pronounced when measuring mortality in terms of YPLL compared to death counts, reflecting the greater intensity of the disparities at younger ages. We also find substantial state-to-state variability in the magnitudes of the estimated racial/ethnic disparities, suggesting that they are driven in large part by social determinants of health whose degree of association with race/ethnicity varies by state.","Xu, Jay J; Chen, Jarvis T; Belin, Thomas R; Brookmeyer, Ronald S; Suchard, Marc A; Ramirez, Christina M",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,597
447805,COVID impact: psychological disorders and COVID-19 among ICU caregivers in April and October 2020,2021,"BACKGROUND: Effective communication during a health crisis can ease public concerns and promote the adoption of important risk-mitigating behaviors. Public health agencies and leaders have served as the primary communicators of information related to COVID-19, and a key part of their public outreach has taken place on social media platforms. OBJECTIVE: This study examined the content and engagement of COVID-19 tweets authored by Canadian public health agencies and decision makers. We propose ways for public health accounts to adjust their tweeting practices during public health crises to improve risk communication and maximize engagement. METHODS: We retrieved data from tweets by Canadian public health agencies and decision makers from January 1, 2020, to June 30, 2020. The Twitter accounts were categorized as belonging to either a public health agency, regional or local health department, provincial health authority, medical health officer, or minister of health. We analyzed trends in COVID-19 tweet engagement and conducted a content analysis on a stratified random sample of 485 tweets to examine the message functions and risk communication strategies used by each account type. RESULTS: We analyzed 32,737 tweets authored by 118 Canadian public health Twitter accounts, of which 6982 tweets were related to COVID-19. Medical health officers authored the largest percentage of COVID-19-related tweets (n=1337, 35%) relative to their total number of tweets and averaged the highest number of retweets per COVID-19 tweet (112 retweets per tweet). Public health agencies had the highest frequency of daily tweets about COVID-19 throughout the study period. Compared to tweets containing media and user mentions, hashtags and URLs were used in tweets more frequently by all account types, appearing in 69% (n=4798 tweets) and 68% (n=4781 tweets) of COVID-19-related tweets, respectively. Tweets containing hashtags also received the highest average retweets (47 retweets per tweet). Our content analysis revealed that of the three tweet message functions analyzed (information, action, community), tweets providing information were the most commonly used across most account types, constituting 39% (n=181) of all tweets; however, tweets promoting actions from users received higher than average retweets (55 retweets per tweet). When examining tweets that received one or more retweet (n=359), the difference between mean retweets across the message functions was statistically significant (P<.001). The risk communication strategies that we examined were not widely used by any account type, appearing in only 262 out of 485 tweets. However, when these strategies were used, these tweets received more retweets compared to tweets that did not use any risk communication strategies (P<.001) (61 retweets versus 13 retweets on average). CONCLUSIONS: Public health agencies and decision makers should examine what messaging best meets the needs of their Twitter audiences to maximize sharing of their communications. Public health accounts that do not currently employ risk communication strategies in their tweets may be missing an important opportunity to engage with users about the mitigation of health risks related to COVID-19.","Slavik, Catherine E; Buttle, Charlotte; Sturrock, Shelby L; Darlington, J Connor; Yiannakoulias, Niko",J Med Internet Res,,597

We successfully teach an RL-based agent to perform sub-tasks in the simulator environment, using either image or state data. As far as we know, this is the first time an RL-based agent is taught from visual data in a surgical robotics environment. Additionally, we tackle the sample inefficiency of RL using a simple-to-implement system which we term hybrid-batch learning (HBL), effectively adding a second, long-term replay buffer to the Q-learning process. Additionally, this allows us to bootstrap learning from images from the data collected using the easier task of learning from state. We show that HBL decreases our learning times significantly.","Barnoy, Yotam; O'Brien, Molly; Wang, Will; Hager, Gregory",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.01006v1.pdf,597

448763,Bereavement via Zoom during COVID-19,2021,"Adventitial cystic disease (ACD) is a rare condition in which a mucinous cyst forms within the adventitia, usually in arteries but rarely in veins. A 79-year-old patient presented with stomachache and nausea. Computerized tomography showed pelvic cysts on either side of the pelvis. The right tumor was 120×100 mm, and the left tumor was 45×35 mm. Our diagnosis was bilateral ovarian tumors and we performed laparoscopic tumor resection. In the abdominal cavity, we saw that the left ovary was swollen by about 3-4 cm and the right ovary was normal size. There was a mucous cyst located in the right retroperitoneal cavity that adhered around and bordered the right external iliac vein and the right obturator nerve. We peeled the adhesion away carefully and resected the tumor but the operation caused temporary obturator nerve paralysis. From pathological examination, we diagnosed the right retroperitoneal cyst to be venous ACD originating from the right external iliac vein. We found that venous ACD can grow as large as a pelvic tumor and is difficult to distinguish from an ovarian tumor, which is why we chose laparoscopic surgery. In this case, we performed the operation laparoscopically and no sequelae or recurrent tumor appeared during a 1-year follow-up. However, graft replacement is sometimes necessary for ACD, thus venous ACD should be considered a differential diagnosis and a surgical strategy should be developed when pelvic tumors are observed.","Higami, Shota; Ueda, Taeko; Sakakibara, Yu; Tohyama, Atsushi; Harada, Hiroshi; Kurita, Tomoko; Kagami, Seiji; Matsuura, Yusuke; Yoshino, Kiyoshi",J UOEH,,597

Students need a respite from the long standing social isolation so that they regain their chance to develop holistically, but after the devastating effects of the second wave, the administrators as well as parents are skeptical about the decision of school reopening. PROCESS: The Indian Academy of Pediatrics constituted a task force comprising of national and international experts in the field who deliberated on the issue. OBJECTIVES: To bring out scientifically supported guidelines on the prerequisites of opening and attending the schools, in the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic. RECOMMENDATIONS: The task force recommends i) Decentralization of the school reopening decision;ii)Three epidemiological parameters, case positivity rate (<5 or steadily declining number of cases for past two weeks), number of new cases(<20 per lakh population per day for past two weeks) and vaccination coverage (>60% of the vaccine-eligible population) to be met at the local level, before the schools reopen;and iii) Criteria regarding health and vaccination to be met by the schoolattendees.","Ghate, S.; Zadey, S.; Thapar, R.

The outbreak of the novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) in a short period of time exposed the problems existing in the allocation of medical resources and the response to major public health emergencies in China. By using Kernel density estimation and Data envelopment analysis (DEA), it is found that the allocation and imbalance of medical resources in China are greatly different among regions, and the polarization phenomenon is obvious. As an important part of the information technology system, blockchain technology is characterized by decentralization and non-tampering. It can realize sharing of medical resources through a mechanism of resource storage, circulation, supervision, and protection. The construction of a medical resource sharing mechanism under the condition of blockchain technology will greatly improve the degree of medical resource sharing, will narrow the differences in resource allocation between regions, and can effectively respond to an outbreak of major public health emergencies.","Liu, Hu; Liu, Yuxuan",,,597
450440,Why are women better protected from COVID-19: Clues for men? Sex and COVID-19,2020,"Complement, contact activation, coagulation, and fibrinolysis are serum protein cascades that need strict regulation to maintain human health. Serum glycoprotein, a C1 inhibitor (C1-INH), is a key regulator (inhibitor) of serine proteases of all the above-mentioned pathways. Recently, an autotransporter protein, virulence-associated gene 8 (Vag8), produced by the whooping cough pathogen, Bordetella pertussis, was shown to bind to C1-INH and interfere with its function. Here, we present the structure of the Vag8-C1-INH complex determined using cryo-electron microscopy at a 3.6-Å resolution. The structure shows a unique mechanism of C1-INH inhibition not employed by other pathogens, where Vag8 sequesters the reactive center loop of C1-INH, preventing its interaction with the target proteases.IMPORTANCE The structure of a 10-kDa protein complex is one of the smallest to be determined using cryo-electron microscopy at high resolution. The structure reveals that C1-INH is sequestered in an inactivated state by burial of the reactive center loop in Vag8. By so doing, the bacterium is able to simultaneously perturb the many pathways regulated by C1-INH. Virulence mechanisms such as the one described here assume more importance given the emerging evidence about dysregulation of contact activation, coagulation, and fibrinolysis leading to COVID-19 pneumonia.","Dhillon, Arun; Deme, Justin C; Furlong, Emily; Roem, Dorina; Jongerius, Ilse; Johnson, Steven; Lea, Susan M",mBio (Online),,597

A significant proportion of the population live alone or are vulnerable to mental health problems yet, in the vast majority of cases, individuals in social isolation have no access to mental healthcare. The only resource is people themselves using self-help, self-medication and self-care. During prolonged COVID-19 isolation, an in-built system of homeostasis can help rebalance activity, thought and feeling. Increased physical activity enables a reset of physical and mental well-being. During periods of lockdown, it is recommended that exercise should be as vigorously promoted as social distancing itself.","Matias, Thiago; Dominski, Fabio H; Marks, David F",J Health Psychol,,597
450464,Evolution of a Virtual Multidisciplinary Cleft and Craniofacial Team Clinic During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Children's Hospital Colorado Experience,2020,"Oculo-centric factors may provide a key to understanding invasion success by SARS-CoV-2, a highly contagious, potentially lethal, virus with ocular tropism. Respiratory infection transmission via the eye and lacrimal-nasal pathway elucidated during the 1918 influenza pandemic, remains to be explored in this crisis. The eye and its adnexae represent a large surface area directly exposed to airborne viral particles and hand contact. The virus may bind to corneal and conjunctival angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and potentially to the lipophilic periocular skin and superficial tear film with downstream carriage into the nasopharynx and subsequent access to the lungs and gut. Adenoviruses and influenza viruses share this ocular tropism and despite differing ocular and systemic manifestations and disease patterns, common lessons, particularly in management, emerge. Slit lamp usage places ophthalmologists at particular risk of exposure to high viral loads (and poor prognosis) and as for adenoviral epidemics, this may be a setting for disease transmission. Local, rather than systemic treatments blocking virus binding in this pathway (advocated for adenovirus) are worth considering. This pathway is accessible with eye drops or aerosols containing drugs which appear efficacious via systemic administration. A combination such as hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and zinc, all of which have previously been used topically in the eye and which work at least in part by blocking ACE2 receptors, may offer a safe, cost-effective and resource-sparing intervention.","Coroneo, Minas Theodore",Ocular surf,,597

METHODS This was a case-control study conducted in Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at Patna Medical College and Hospital, Patna, Bihar. Study period was from 01st April 2020 to 30th September 2020. All the patients except Covid-19 positive cases, coming to Gynaecology Outpatient Department (GOPD), antenatal care (ANC) and labour room emergency (LRE) were included in the study. Patients who were seen from April 2019 to September 2019, total of 20,961 were in ""pre Covid-19"" control group, while patients seen from April 2020 to September 2020, a total of 8,859 were in ""during Covid-19"" case group. Records of all health parameters for patients were reviewed, and then divided into two groups as patient input indicators and healthcare efficiency indicators. Number of patients visiting GOPD, ANC and admitted in LRE comprised patient input indicators (implying hospital avoiding attitude) while delivery rate, dilation and evacuation (D & E) rate, stillbirth rate and mortality rate comprised healthcare efficiency indicators. RESULTS Overall patients visiting the hospital dropped down from 21,361 to 8859 (by 58.5 %);GOPD patients reduced by 74 % while total ANC patients reduced by 44 %;and total LRE admissions reduced by 35.3 %. CONCLUSIONS Despite increased health professionals (workdays) per patient in LRE, mortality rate and still birth rate increased by 60.2 % and 23 % respectively indicating worsening of efficiency which is direct hidden negative psychological impact of pandemic immediately calling for the need of positive counselling and proper psychiatric care of both the health professionals and patients.","Hans, P.; Sinha, A.; Kumar, U.",Journal of Evolution of Medical and Dental Sciences-Jemds,,597

451733,The Impact of Covid-19 on Surgical Activity in A Model 3 Irish Hospital,2020,"Basic broadband connectivity is regarded as generally having a positive macroeconomic effect. However, over the past decade there has been an emerging school of thought suggesting the impacts of upgrading to higher speed broadband have been overstated, potentially leading to the inefficient allocation of taxpayer-funded subsidies. In this analysis we model the impacts of Next Generation Access on new business creation using high-resolution panel data. After controlling for a range of factors, the results provide evidence of a small but significant negative impact of high-speed broadband on new business creation over the study period which we suggest could be due to two factors. Firstly, moving from basic to high-speed broadband provides few benefits to enable new businesses being formed. Secondly, strong price competition and market consolidation from online service providers (e.g. Amazon etc.) may be deterring new business start-ups. This analysis provides another piece of evidence to suggest that the economic impact of broadband is more nuanced than the debate has traditionally suggested. Our conjecture is that future policy decisions need to be more realistic about the potential economic impacts of broadband, including those effects that could be negative on the stock of local businesses and therefore the local tax base.","Chen, Philip; Oughton, Edward J; Tyler, Pete; Jia, Mo; Zagdanski, Jakub",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.14113v1.pdf,597

We then frame the resulting multiple graph regularized matrix completion problem as deep matrix factorization. This is solved by using a novel optimization method called HyPALM (Hybrid Proximal Alternating Linearized Minimization). Results on our curated RNA drug virus association (DVA) dataset shows that the proposed approach excels over state-of-the-art graph regularized matrix completion techniques.

454519,Operational Radiology Recovery in Academic Radiology Departments After the COVID-19 Pandemic: Moving Toward Normalcy,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic led to dramatic increases in telemedicine use to provide outpatient care without in-person contact risks. Telemedicine increases options for health care access, but a ""digital divide"" of disparate access may prevent certain populations from realizing the benefits of telemedicine. OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to understand telemedicine utilization patterns after a widespread deployment to identify potential disparities exacerbated by expanded telemedicine usage. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional retrospective analysis of adults who scheduled outpatient visits between June 1, 2020 and August 31, 2020 at a single-integrated academic health system encompassing a broad range of subspecialties and a large geographic region in the Upper Midwest, during a period of time after the initial surge of COVID-19 when most standard clinical services had resumed. At the beginning of this study period, approximately 72% of provider visits were telemedicine visits. The primary study outcome was whether a patient had one or more video-based visits, compared with audio-only (telephone) visits or in-person visits only. The secondary outcome was whether a patient had any telemedicine visits (video-based or audio-only), compared with in-person visits only. RESULTS: A total of 197,076 individuals were eligible (average age = 46 years, 56% females). Increasing age, rural status, Asian or Black/African American race, Hispanic ethnicity, and self-pay/uninsured status were significantly negatively associated with having a video visit. Digital literacy, measured by patient portal activation status, was significantly positively associated with having a video visit, as were Medicaid or Medicare as payer and American Indian/Alaskan Native race. CONCLUSION: Our findings reinforce previous evidence that older age, rural status, lower socioeconomic status, Asian race, Black/African American race, and Hispanic/Latino ethnicity are associated with lower rates of video-based telemedicine use. Health systems and policies should seek to mitigate such barriers to telemedicine when possible, with efforts such as digital literacy outreach and equitable distribution of telemedicine infrastructure.","Hsiao, Vivian; Chandereng, Thevaa; Lankton, Robin L; Huebner, Jeffrey A; Baltus, Jeffrey J; Flood, Grace E; Dean, Shannon M; Tevaarwerk, Amye J; Schneider, David F",Appl Clin Inform,,597

However, there is a dearth of information regarding the impact of COVID-19 in patients with tuberculosis, HIV, chronic hepatitis, and other concurrent infections. This review was conducted to evaluate the consequence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in patients with concurrent co-infections based on the publications reported to date. An extensive comprehensive screening was conducted using electronic databases up to 3rd September 2020 after obtaining registration with PROSPERO (CRD420202064800). The observational studies or interventional studies in English, evaluating the impact of SARS-CoV-2 in patients with concurrent infections are included for the meta-analyses. Our search retrieved 20 studies, with a total of 205,702 patients. Patients with tuberculosis (RR = 2.10; 95% CI, 1.75-2.51; I2 = 0%), influenza (RR = 2.04; 95% CI, 0.15-28.25, I2 = 99%) have an increased risk of mortality during a co-infection with SARS-CoV-2. No significant impact is found in people living with HIV (RR = 0.99; 95% CI, 0.82-1.19; I2 = 30%), Chronic hepatitis (RR = 1.15; 95% CI, 0.73-1.81; I2 = 10%). Several countries (Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina, Peru, Colombia, and Singapore) are on the verge of a dengue co epidemic (cumulative 878,496 and 5,028,380 cases of dengue and COVID-19 respectively). The impact of COVID-19 in patients of concurrent infections with either tuberculosis or influenza is detrimental.

Methods Demographics, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities and outcomes were extracted retrospectively from the medical records of ICU patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia from the Elisabeth-TweeSteden Hospital in Tilburg, the Netherlands from March until June 2020. Primary outcome was 28-day mortality and secondary outcomes were differences between survivors and non-survivors. Results Between March 1 and June 4, 2020, 114 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to the ICU. There were 83 (72.8%) survivors and 31 (27.2%) non-survivors. Non-survivors were significantly older (72.0 years [interquartile range, IQR 67.0-76.0] versus 65.0 years [IQR 58.0-73.0], P = 0.002), had a significantly higher Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) score (54 [IQR 45-72] versus 43 [IQR 36-53], P &lt; 0.001) and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (7 [IQR 4-7] versus 5 [IQR 3-6], P = 004). cTnT values were significantly higher in non-survivors due to more myocarditis (83.9% versus 40.8%, P &lt; 0.001).

455366,Covid-19 pandemic: A new chapter in the history of infectious diseases,2020,"Coronavirus (CoV) is a virus infectious disease with a considerable spectrum of clinical presentations. Symptoms ranged from asymptomatic infection to severe pneumonia that may lead to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and several clinical complications. Neurologic symptoms related to CoV have been described recently in the literature. The relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and the central nervous system (CNS) is still not clear. This review aimed to reveal the current knowledge regarding CNS manifestation in SARS-CoV-2. A systematic literature review was carried out to identify the particularities of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with CNS involvement, using the PubMed database between January 1, 2020 and April 30, 2020. Conference papers, reviews, published letters, editorials, studies in pregnant women and children, and studies only reporting on a specific factor were excluded. An initial search included as many as 83 articles. Out of the 83 screened articles, 32 were selected for full-text review. Sixteen studies were excluded because they did not analyze nervous system involvement in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, 16 papers were included in this review. There were three retrospective studies and 13 case reports/series of cases. Data from the current literature reveal that patients who suffer from a severe illness have more CNS involvement, neurological symptoms (i.e., dizziness, headache) and an association with strokes. The severe patients had higher D-dimer and C-reactive protein levels than non-severe patients and presented multiple organ involvement, such as serious liver, kidney and muscle damage.","Severo Bem Junior, L.; do Rego Aquino, P.

Previous research has documented an array of responses to mass crises or disasters, including chronic anxiety and posttraumatic stress as well as resilience and recovery. Much can be learned from this research about how people have coped in the past in order to identify strategies that may be particularly effective in managing distress and cultivating resilience during these perilous times. We delineate multiple coping strategies (e.g., behavioral activation, acceptance-based coping, mindfulness practice, loving-kindness practices) geared to decrease stress and promote resilience and recovery. These strategies may be especially effective because they help individuals make meaning, build distress tolerance, increase social support, foster a view of our deep human interconnectedness, and take goal-directed value-driven actions in midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Polizzi, Craig; Lynn, Steven Jay; Perry, Andrew",Clin.

456619,"COVID-19, Urologists and Hospitals",2020,"The lockdowns and travel restrictions in current coronavirus pandemic situation has replaced face-to-face teaching and meeting with online teaching and meeting. Recently, the video conferencing tool Zoom has become extremely popular for its simple-to-use feature and low network bandwith requirement. However, Zoom has serious security and privacy issues. Due to weak authentication mechanisms, unauthorized persons are invading Zoom sessions and creating disturbances (known as Zoom bombing). In this paper, we propose a preliminary work towards a seamless authentication mechanism for Zoom-based teaching and meeting. Our method is based on PRNU (Photo Response Non Uniformity)-based camera authentication, which can authenticate the camera of a device used in a Zoom meeting without requiring any assistance from the participants (e.g., needing the participant to provide biometric). Results from a small-scale experiment validates the proposed method.","Mohanty, Manoranjan; Yaqub, Waheeb",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.10553v1.pdf,597

456764,COVID-19: are the elderly prepared for virtual healthcare?,2021,"Hungary, like many countries, features a complex mix of the public and private sector in the financing and provision of health care services. At the same time, the health system also faces challenges related to shortages of health professionals, low public financing, and informal payments. With the added pressure from the COVID-19 pandemic, Hungarian policymakers acted rapidly to pass a sweeping regulation aimed at these issues. Over two days, the Hungarian parliament introduced and unanimously approved a new regulation, Act C of 2020 on the Employment Status of Health Workers, that replaces the existing public employment relationship between health professionals, public providers and their controlling authorities. The Act, passed on 6 October 2020, brings the employment of health workers under strict central control by introducing a new employment status similar to that of the armed forces. The Act also provides doctors with an unprecedented 120% salary increase and criminalizes informal payments. The reception has been overwhelmingly negative, with thousands of health professionals indicating that they would not sign the new contracts, and the policy also contains serious technical and feasibility concerns. Although the first statistics show that only about 3-5% of the active workforce did not sign the contract by 1 March 2021, the implementation of the reform still faces serious challenges.","Gaal, Peter; Velkey, Zita; Szerencses, Viktoria; Webb, Erin",Health policy,,597

SETTING: This was a cross-sectional study and total of 15 000 HCWs involved in providing services and care to the patients with COVID-19 were randomly selected from all over Pakistan. PARTICIPANTS: Informed consent was taken from all participants and were included according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. All testing was done on serum samples for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies using Abbott Chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay. An index of 1.4 was used as a cut-off to mark reactive and non-reactive cases. SPSS V.23.0 was used for data analysis. OUTCOME: Immune status of the study population depicting seroprevalence among HCWs. RESULTS: Out of all the candidates, majority of the HCWs were men (61.9%) and were doctors (62.4%). The mean age of participants was 32.8 years (SD 8.7) and majority were asymptomatic (51.8%). In this study, 33% of the HCWs were reactive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody. Around 44% of the reactive cases were asymptomatic. The symptoms more significantly associated with seropositivity were: fever (OR 1.31; 95% CI 1.16 to 1.48), headache (OR 2.43; 95% CI 2.16 to 2.73), cough and shortness of breath (OR 2.10; 95% CI 1.91 to 2.31), loss of sense of smell or taste (OR 3.70; 95% CI 3.29 to 4.17) (p<0.001). Factors which showed significant association with the presence of antibodies were professional category (absolute risk (AR) 0.09; OR 1.46; 95% CI 1.36 to 1.56), availability of protective masks (AR 0.02; OR 0.90; 95% CI 0.84 to 0.96), safety goggles (AR 0.02; OR 0.90; 95% CI 0.84 to 0.97) and living arrangements (AR 0.03; OR 1.12; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.20) (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Our study showed a high seropositivity of HCWs dealing with patients with COVID-19 in Pakistan revealing significant association with professional category, nature of work place and precautions taken while performing duties.","Batool, Hijab; Chughtai, Omar; Khan, Muhammad Dilawar; Chughtai, Akhtar Sohail; Ashraf, Shakeel; Khan, Muhammad Jamil",BMJ Open,,597

Orthopaedic clinic telephone consultations in the COVID-19 era- a patient and clinician perspective",2021,"We study an SEIQR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Quarantined-Recovered) model for an infectious disease, with time delays for latency and an asymptomatic phase. For fast pandemics where nobody has prior immunity and everyone has immunity after recovery, the SEIQR model decouples into two nonlinear delay differential equations (DDEs) with five parameters. One parameter is set to unity by scaling time. The subcase of perfect quarantining and zero self-recovery before quarantine, with two free parameters, is examined first. The method of multiple scales yields a hyperbolic tangent solution; and a long-wave approximation yields a first order ordinary differential equation (ODE). With imperfect quarantining and nonzero self-recovery, the long-wave approximation is a second order ODE. These three approximations each capture the full outbreak, from infinitesimal initiation to final saturation. Low-dimensional dynamics in the DDEs is demonstrated using a six state non-delayed reduced order model obtained by Galerkin projection. Numerical solutions from the reduced order model match the DDE over a range of parameter choices and initial conditions. Finally, stability analysis and numerics show how correctly executed time-varying social distancing, within the present model, can cut the number of affected people by almost half. Alternatively, faster detection followed by near-certain quarantining can potentially be even more effective.","Vyasarayani, C. P.; Chatterjee, Anindya",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.03878v1.pdf,597

The psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on this group are still unknown, and we want to explore how their quality of life (QoL) has changed in this unique situation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online survey, composed of pandemic-specific items, plus the EORTC QLQ-C30, was administered to a cohort of HNC survivors. Using previously published reference values as a control group, we have evaluated the impact of the pandemic on their QoL. We have also explored the differences between those who had received a total laryngectomy (LP, laryngectomized population) vs other HNC patients, in order to assess the role of tracheostomy in this regard. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-one HNC patients completed the survey. The scores of the physical (80.5 vs 85, p = 0.028), role (78 vs 84, p = 0.030), and emotional functioning (76 vs 81, p = 0.041) were significantly different in the two groups, with worse functioning in our patients. Comparing LP with the other HNC patients, social (76.6 vs 88.9, p = 0.008) and physical functioning (75.5 vs 86.1, p = 0.006) were significantly worse in the former group. LP also reported a greater perception that others are afraid to be close to them (1.67 vs 1.32, p = 0.020). No differences were found between LP with and without voice prosthesis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show how HNC patients are at high risk for a worsening in QoL because of the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic.","Gallo, Oreste; Bruno, Chiara; Locatello, Luca Giovanni; Martelli, Federica; Cilona, Maria; Orlando, Pietro; Fancello, Giuseppe; Maggiore, Giandomenico; Viberti, Francesca; Ciabatti, Pierguido; Boccuzzi, Simone; Mandalà, Marco",Support. care cancer,,597

The inverse opal hydrogel structure features well-defined, interconnected pores with high similarity to human alveolar sacs. By populating the sacs with primary human alveolar epithelial cells, functional epithelial monolayers are readily formed. Cyclic strain is integrated into the device to allow biomimetic breathing events of the alveolar lung, which, in addition, makes it possible to investigate pathological effects such as those incurred by cigarette smoking and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pseudoviral infection. Our study demonstrates a unique method for reconstitution of the functional human pulmonary alveoli in vitro, which is anticipated to pave the way for investigating relevant physiological and pathological events in the human distal lung.","Huang, Di; Liu, Tingting; Liao, Junlong; Maharjan, Sushila; Xie, Xin; Pérez, Montserrat; Anaya, Ingrid; Wang, Shiwei; Tirado Mayer, Alan; Kang, Zhixin; Kong, Weijia; Mainardi, Valerio Luca; Garciamendez-Mijares, Carlos Ezio; García Martínez, Germán; Moretti, Matteo; Zhang, Weijia; Gu, Zhongze; Ghaemmaghami, Amir M; Zhang, Yu Shrike",Proc.

Recent evidence has been conflicting, with both thyrotoxicosis and suppression of thyroid function reported. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to detail the acute effects of COVID-19 on thyroid function and determine if these effects persisted upon recovery from COVID-19. DESIGN: Cohort observational study. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Adult patients admitted to Imperial College Healthcare National Health Service Trust, London, UK with suspected COVID-19 between March 9 to April 22, 2020 were included, excluding those with pre-existing thyroid disease and those missing either free thyroxine (FT4) or TSH measurements. Of 456 patients, 334 had COVID-19 and 122 did not. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: TSH and FT4 measurements at admission, and where available, those taken in 2019 and at COVID-19 follow-up. RESULTS: Most patients (86·6%) presenting with COVID-19 were euthyroid, with none presenting with overt thyrotoxicosis. Patients with COVID-19 had a lower admission TSH and FT4 compared to those without COVID-19. In the COVID-19 patients with matching baseline thyroid function tests from 2019 (n=185 for TSH and 104 for FT4), both TSH and FT4 were reduced at admission compared to baseline. In a complete cases analysis of COVID-19 patients with TSH measurements at follow-up, admission and baseline (n=55), TSH was seen to recover to baseline at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with COVID-19 present with euthyroidism. We observed mild reductions in TSH and FT4 in keeping with a non-thyroidal illness syndrome.

The present survey aimed to provide a European overview on the COVID-19 impact on surgical oncology. METHODS: This anonymous online survey was accessible from April 24 to May 11, 2020, for surgeons (n = 298) who were contacted by the surgical society European Digestive Surgery. The survey was completed by 88 surgeons (29.2%) from 69 different departments. The responses per department were evaluated. RESULTS: Of the departments, 88.4% (n = 61/69) reported a lower volume of patients in the outpatient clinic; 69.1% (n = 47/68) and 75.0% (n = 51/68) reported a reduction in hospital bed and the operating room capacity, respectively. As a result, the participants reported an average reduction of 29.3% for all types of oncological resections surveyed in this questionnaire. The strongest reduction was observed for oncological resections of hepato-pancreatico-biliary (HPB) cancers. Of the interviewed surgeons, 68.7% (n = 46/67) agreed that survival outcomes will be negatively impacted by the pandemic. CONCLUSION: The first COVID-19 pandemic wave had a significant impact on surgical oncology in Europe. The surveyed surgeons expect an increase in the number of unresectable cancers as well as poorer survival outcomes due to cancellations of follow-ups and postponements of surgeries.","Stöss, Christian; Steffani, Marcella; Pergolini, Ilaria; Hartmann, Daniel; Radenkovic, Dejan; Novotny, Alexander; Friess, Helmut; Müller, Michael W",Dig Surg,,597

460936,The potential impact of the COVID-19 response related lockdown on TB incidence and mortality in India,2020,"Introduction: SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory virus supposed to enter the organism through aerosol or fomite transmission to the nose, eyes and oropharynx. It is responsible for various clinical symptoms, including hyposmia and other neurological ones. Current literature suggests the olfactory mucosa as a port of entry to the CNS, but how the virus reaches the olfactory groove is still unknown. Because the first neurological symptoms of invasion (hyposmia) do not correspond to first signs of infection, the hypothesis of direct contact through airborne droplets during primary infection and therefore during inspiration is not plausible. The aim of this study is to evaluate if a secondary spread to the olfactory groove in a retrograde manner during expiration could be more probable. Methods: Four three-dimensional virtual models were obtained from actual CT scans and used to simulate expiratory droplets. The volume mesh consists of 25 million of cells, the simulated condition is a steady expiration, driving a flow rate of 270 ml/s, for a duration of 0.6 seconds. The droplet diameter is of 5 µm. Results: The analysis of the simulations shows the virus to have a high probability to be deployed in the rhinopharynx, on the tail of medium and upper turbinates. The possibility for droplets to access the olfactory mucosa during the expiratory phase is lower than other nasal areas, but consistent. Discussion: The data obtained from these simulations demonstrates the virus can be deployed in the olfactory groove during expiration. Even if the total amount in a single act is scarce, it must be considered it is repeated tens of thousands of times a day, and the source of contamination continuously acts on a timescale of several days. The present results also imply CNS penetration of SARS-CoV-2 through olfactory mucosa might be considered a complication and, consequently, prevention strategies should be considered in diseased patients.","Pipolo, Carlotta; Bulfamante, Antonio Mario; Schillaci, Andrea; Banchetti, Jacopo; Castellani, Luca; Saibene, Alberto Maria; Felisati, Giovanni; Quadrio, Maurizio",Int J Med Sci,,597

This stepwise approach integrated virtual bioequivalence trials to simulate the test to reference (T/R) ratio for positive (i.e., bioequivalent) and negative (i.e., non-bioequivalent) control formulations containing ibuprofen, approximated distribution of interoccasion variability (IOV) on ibuprofen peak (Cmax) and extent of exposure (AUC) by bootstrapping resampling methods, post hoc incorporation of IOV to simulated T/R ratios, and power curve analysis. After post hoc incorporation of the bootstrapped IOV to the simulated Cmax T/R geometric mean ratios, the resulting 90% confidence intervals overlapped with the in vivo observations for both pairwise comparisons. On the other hand, simulated and observed AUC TNBE/R geometric mean ratios differed, likely due to the lack of propagating clearance-related IOV to the simulations. This approach is in line with modern regulatory initiatives that advocate leveraging quantitative methods and modeling to modernize generic drug development and review.

461130,COVID-19: contact and gesture monitoring using PROUD Technology,2020,"The article deals with the problem of assessing the effectiveness of the measures taken by the governments to overcome the crisis caused by the COVID19 pandemic. This problem is urgent since the governments and the international institutions have not defined common approaches and rules for state regulation during a pandemic. The varying degrees of restrictions and support measures applied by the governments of different countries have led to different results. The proposed model makes it possible to assess the effectiveness of government decisions by comparing the cost-benefit ratio with the maximum possible value reached in a group of similar countries. The mathematical apparatus used in this case is Data Envelopment Analysis, DEA. Several DEA-analysis models presented in this article allow us to assess the comparative efficiency for 20 European countries based on the ratio of inputs - the Government Stringency Index or individual policies of restrictions or support, and outputs - mortality rates and changes in the GDP.

461520,Interim Management of COVID-19 by Repurposed Homeopathic Medicines,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Spain is one of the countries with the highest number of COVID-19 patients. Unfortunately, few data for regions are available. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to describe the characteristics and independent risk factors associated with COVID-19 mortality in Castilla-La Mancha, Spain. METHODS: Cohort and multicenter study in all 14 public hospitals of the Castilla-La Mancha Health Service. Baseline characteristics, preexisting comorbidities, symptoms, clinical features and treatments were included. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate factors associated with death and Kaplan-Meier test to examine survival probability. Statistical significance was considered with p<0.05 (95% CI). SPSS (version 24.0 for Windows) and R 4.0.2 (R Statistics) software were used. RESULTS: The cohort comprised 12,126 patients sequentially attended between February 11 and May 11, 2020. The mean age of patients was 66.4 years; 5667 (46.7%) were women. Six protective factors against exitus were defined: female sex, anosmia, cough, chloroquine and azithromycin. The risk factors were: age over 50, obesity, cardiac pathology, fever, dyspnea, lung infiltrates, lymphopenia, D-dimer above 1000ng/mL, and mechanical ventilation requirement. Survival analysis showed higher survival rate in women (75.7%) than men (72.1%). Cumulative survival was 87.5% for non-hospitalized patients, 70.2% for patients admitted to hospital and 61.2% in ICU patients. Additionally, survival probability decreased with increasing age range. CONCLUSION: Determination of protective or death-promoting factors could be useful to stratify patients by severity criteria and to improve COVID-19 care management.","Muñoz-Rodríguez, José Ramón; Gómez-Romero, Francisco Javier; Pérez-Ortiz, José Manuel; López-Juárez, Pilar; Santiago, Juan Luis; Serrano-Oviedo, Leticia; Redondo-Calvo, Francisco Javier",Arch Bronconeumol,,597

Individuals approaching or within older adulthood may be especially vulnerable to these psychosocial stressors and their impact on mental health outcomes. Consequently, there is an urgent need to identify protective factors for older adults. The purpose of the present study was to determine the relative contribution of coping flexibility (CF) and two distinct coping strategies, forward-focused and trauma-focused, on negative affect in persons 50 years of age and older during the COVID-19 pandemic.Method: Data were collected using an online survey, including questions about demographic information, coping, depression, and anxiety. Participants aged 50 and over were included in our analyses of depression (N = 800) and anxiety (N = 638).Results: Both higher CF and higher forward-focused coping predicted lower depression and lower anxiety. In contrast, higher trauma-focused coping predicted slightly higher depressive symptoms but was not a significant predictor of anxiety.Conclusion: Our findings suggest that higher forward-focused coping may serve as a protective factor in older adults during the pandemic and, therefore, may be an effective treatment target for mental health interventions.","Jordan, Leslie S; Woodard, John L; Pena, Gabriel S; Arnold-Nedimala, Naomi A; Won, Junyeon; Callow, Daniel D; Smith, J Carson",Aging Ment Health,,597

Advances in this field have made it possible to elucidate the pathomechanism of dysautonomia and autonomic nervous system interactions in both health and disease. In the special issue ?Recent Advances in Autonomic Neurology,? four articles covering a wide range of topics in clinical neuroscience, including degenerative diseases, genetic disorders, immune-mediated neuropathy, and autoimmune encephalitis, were published. This review focused on presenting the recent progress in the clinical approaches for dysautonomia in autoimmune diseases, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Of particular current concern, is Long COVID, defined as the persistence of symptoms after 3 weeks from being infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), may involve autonomic dysfunction. The research and clinical practice for autonomic dysfunction in neurology is constantly evolving, which is exemplified by the current clinical research on Long COVID.","Nakane, Shunya",Neurology and Clinical Neuroscience,,597

For the evaluation of parenchymal heterogeneity, CT texture analysis was performed using dedicated software (Olea Medical, France). The texture analysis of each case consisted of 15 first-order intensity-based features, 17 gray level co-occurrence matrix-based features, and 9 gray level run length matrix-based features. RESULTS: A total of 91 patients (45 males, 46 females) with a mean age of 54.31±16.33 years (range: 18?81) were included in the study. A statistically significant decrease in spleen size was seen in the follow-up CT examinations (p < 0.001) whereas no statistically significant difference was found between the Hounsfield unit (HU) values. The radiomics consisted of first-order intensity-based features such as 90th percentile, maximum, interquartile range, range, mean absolute deviation, standard deviation, and variance, all of which showed statistically significant differences (p-values: < 0.001, < 0.001, 0.001, 0.003, 0.001, 0.001, and 0.004, respectively). ?Correlation? as a gray level co-occurrence matrix-based feature and ?gray level non-uniformity? as a gray level run length matrix-based feature showed statistically differences (p-values: 0.033 and < 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Although COVID-19 manifests with lung involvement in the early stage, it can also cause systemic involvement, and the spleen may be one of its target organs. A decrease in the spleen size and parenchymal microstructure changes can be observed in the short follow-up time. It is hoped that the changes in the parenchymal microstructure will be demonstrated by a non-invasive method: texture analysis.","Batur, Abdussamet; KilinÇer, AbIdIn; AteS, FatIh; AktuG DemIr, Nazlim; ErgÜn, RecaI",,,597

DESIGN: We modelled the reduction in CRC survival and life years lost resultant from per-patient delays of 2-6 months in the 2WW pathway. We stratified by age group, individual-level benefit in CRC survival versus age-specific nosocomial COVID-19-related fatality per referred patient undergoing colonoscopy. We modelled mitigation strategies using thresholds of FIT triage of 2, 10 and 150 µg Hb/g to prioritise 2WW referrals for colonoscopy. To construct the underlying models, we employed 10-year net CRC survival for England 2008-2017, 2WW pathway CRC case and referral volumes and per-day-delay HRs generated from observational studies of diagnosis-to-treatment interval. RESULTS: Delay of 2/4/6 months across all 11 266 patients with CRC diagnosed per typical year via the 2WW pathway were estimated to result in 653/1419/2250 attributable deaths and loss of 9214/20 315/32 799 life years. Risk-benefit from urgent investigatory referral is particularly sensitive to nosocomial COVID-19 rates for patients aged >60. Prioritisation out of delay for the 18% of symptomatic referrals with FIT >10 µg Hb/g would avoid 89% of these deaths attributable to presentational/diagnostic delay while reducing immediate requirement for colonoscopy by >80%. CONCLUSIONS: Delays in the pathway to CRC diagnosis and treatment have potential to cause significant mortality and loss of life years. FIT triage of symptomatic patients in primary care could streamline access to colonoscopy, reduce delays for true-positive CRC cases and reduce nosocomial COVID-19 mortality in older true-negative 2WW referrals. However, this strategy offers benefit only in short-term rationalisation of limited endoscopy services: the appreciable false-negative rate of FIT in symptomatic patients means most colonoscopies will still be required.","Loveday, Chey; Sud, Amit; Jones, Michael E; Broggio, John; Scott, Stephen; Gronthound, Firza; Torr, Beth; Garrett, Alice; Nicol, David L; Jhanji, Shaman; Boyce, Stephen A; Williams, Matthew; Barry, Claire; Riboli, Elio; Kipps, Emma; McFerran, Ethna; Muller, David C; Lyratzopoulos, Georgios; Lawler, Mark; Abulafi, Muti; Houlston, Richard S; Turnbull, Clare",Gut,,597

SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic caused a nationwide disruption of APPE pharmacy education. Healthcare institutions faced the challenge of educating APPE students while attempting to simultaneously de-densify work areas and reduce transmission risk for employees and patients. A pharmacist coordinator and pharmacist academic partners at a large teaching hospital created a collaborative common core curriculum model for resourceful implementation of APPE education. Healthcare network pharmacists, clinical pharmacist academic partners, and pharmacy residents delivered the curriculum to 35 pharmacy students over a 9-week time period. Main components of the curriculum included patient case discussions, topic discussions, journal club presentations, live continuing education (CE) webinars, and development of pharmacy technician CE programs. A majority of students reported positive experiences working with a variety of preceptors from different specialties (81%) and collaborating with students from other universities (62%). CONCLUSION: A health system can leverage institutional, network-wide, and academic partner resources to implement a collaborative APPE curriculum during challenging times such as those experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Montepara, Courtney A; Schoen, Rebecca R; Guarascio, Anthony J; McConaha, Jamie L; Horn, Paula J",Am. j. health system pharm,,597
464835,COVID-19 in geriatric age group - a review,2020,"INTRODUCTION: With COVID-19, there is urgency for policymakers to understand and respond to the health needs of slum communities. Lockdowns for pandemic control have health, social and economic consequences. We consider access to healthcare before and during COVID-19 with those working and living in slum communities. METHODS: In seven slums in Bangladesh, Kenya, Nigeria and Pakistan, we explored stakeholder perspectives and experiences of healthcare access for non-COVID-19 conditions in two periods: pre-COVID-19 and during COVID-19 lockdowns. RESULTS: Between March 2018 and May 2020, we engaged with 860 community leaders, residents, health workers and local authority representatives. Perceived common illnesses in all sites included respiratory, gastric, waterborne and mosquitoborne illnesses and hypertension. Pre-COVID, stakeholders described various preventive, diagnostic and treatment services, including well-used antenatal and immunisation programmes and some screening for hypertension, tuberculosis, HIV and vectorborne disease. In all sites, pharmacists and patent medicine vendors were key providers of treatment and advice for minor illnesses. Mental health services and those addressing gender-based violence were perceived to be limited or unavailable. With COVID-19, a reduction in access to healthcare services was reported in all sites, including preventive services. Cost of healthcare increased while household income reduced. Residents had difficulty reaching healthcare facilities. Fear of being diagnosed with COVID-19 discouraged healthcare seeking. Alleviators included provision of healthcare by phone, pharmacists/drug vendors extending credit and residents receiving philanthropic or government support; these were inconsistent and inadequate. CONCLUSION: Slum residents' ability to seek healthcare for non-COVID-19 conditions has been reduced during lockdowns. To encourage healthcare seeking, clear communication is needed about what is available and whether infection control is in place. Policymakers need to ensure that costs do not escalate and unfairly disadvantage slum communities. Remote consulting to reduce face-to-face contact and provision of mental health and gender-based violence services should be considered.","Ahmed, Syed A K Shifat; Ajisola, Motunrayo; Azeem, Kehkashan; Bakibinga, Pauline; Chen, Yen-Fu; Choudhury, Nazratun Nayeem; Fayehun, Olufunke; Griffiths, Frances; Harris, Bronwyn; Kibe, Peter; Lilford, Richard J; Omigbodun, Akinyinka; Rizvi, Narjis; Sartori, Jo; Smith, Simon; Watson, Samuel I; Wilson, Ria; Yeboah, Godwin; Aujla, Navneet; Azam, Syed Iqbal; Diggle, Peter J; Gill, Paramjit; Iqbal, Romaina; Kabaria, Caroline; Kisia, Lyagamula; Kyobutungi, Catherine; Madan, Jason J; Mberu, Blessing; Mohamed, Shukri F; Nazish, Ahsana; Odubanjo, Oladoyin; Osuh, Mary E; Owoaje, Eme; Oyebode, Oyinlola; Porto de Albuquerque, Joao; Rahman, Omar; Tabani, Komal; Taiwo, Olalekan John; Tregonning, Grant; Uthman, Olalekan A; Yusuf, Rita",,,597
464948,Home Dialysis during Covid-19 Outbreak - It Is worth to Consider,2020,"Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread to more than 200 countries all around the world, which are facing challenges in controlling its spread. The Italian Government initiated an unprecedented public health intervention to contain the epidemic by shutting down all people movements. Two weeks after the start of the lockdown period, the daily rate of patient admissions to hospitals significantly decreased. After 2 months, the quarantine progressively came to an end. A practical issue at this time is when and how the lockdown interventions should be relaxed since, without an effective vaccine, the general public still remains vulnerable. However, patient should not be placed at an increased risk of dying of lung cancer just to avoid COVID-19. Attention must be paid to all types of cancers and people should not hesitate to go to the hospital to be treated in time. All necessary actions should be taken by hospitals to minimize the risks of potential contagion, by designating differentiated routes and areas for patients potentially affected by COVID-19, while maintaining the highest standard of oncological care. If this 'cancer amnesia' situation persists, the mortality from lung neoplasms would far exceed that directly associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bertolaccini, Luca; Spaggiari, Lorenzo",Interact Cardiovasc Thorac Surg,,597
465342,Headache medication and the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: The large-scale social distancing efforts to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission have dramatically changed human behaviors associated with traumatic injuries. Trauma centers have reported decreases in trauma volume, paralleled by changes in injury mechanisms. We aimed to quantify changes in trauma epidemiology at an urban level 1 trauma center in a county that instituted one of the earliest shelter-in-place orders, to inform trauma care during future pandemic responses. METHODS: A single-center interrupted time-series analysis was performed to identify associations of shelter-in-place with trauma volume, injury mechanisms, and patient demographics in San Francisco, California. To control for short-term trends in trauma epidemiology, weekly level data were analyzed six months before shelter-in-place. To control for long-term trends, monthly level data were analyzed five years before shelter-in-place. RESULTS: Trauma volume decreased by 50% in the week following shelter-in-place (p<0.01), followed by a linear increase each successive week (p<0.01). Despite this, trauma volume for each month (March-June 2020) remained lower compared to corresponding months for all previous five years (2015-2019). Pediatric trauma volume showed similar trends with initial decreases (p=0.02) followed by steady increases (p=0.05). Reductions in trauma volumes were due entirely to changes in non-violent injury mechanisms, while violence-related injury mechanisms remained unchanged (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Although the shelter-in-place order was associated with an overall decline in trauma volume, violence-related injuries persisted. Delineating and addressing underlying factors driving persistent violence-related injuries during shelter-in-place orders should be a focus of public health efforts in preparation for future pandemic responses.

Although technology enables physicians to stay in touch with patients verbally, we have lost the ability to physically touch. Traditionally, touch is central to medical practice, physical examination guides diagnosis and informs management. But the silent language of touch fulfills a deeper symbolic function, enabling physicians to acknowledge patient concerns in a tangible way. Touch expresses healing, extending beyond skin-to-skin contact to express humanity, caring, and connection.

This meta-analysis was conducted to explore the relationship between gastrointestinal symptoms and the severity of COVID-19. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Science Direct, Embase, and Google Scholar on 16 October 2020, to identify observational studies that provided data on gastrointestinal symptoms and severity of COVID-19. Gastrointestinal symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The severe rate and the odds ratio (OR) were pooled. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic. RESULTS: A total of 21 studies with 5285 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The severe rate of COVID-19 patients with diarrhea was 41.1% [95% confidence interval (CI): 31.0-51.5%], and the OR of association between diarrhea and severe COVID-19 was 1.41 (95% CI: 1.05-1.89); sensitivity analysis showed that the results for the OR and 95% CI were unstable. For abdominal pain, the severe rate and OR of association with severe COVID-19 were 59.3% (95% CI: 41.3-76.4%) and 2.76 (95% CI: 1.59-4.81), respectively; for nausea, 41.4% (95% CI: 23.2-60.7%) and 0.92 (95% CI: 0.59-1.43), respectively; for vomiting, 51.3% (95% CI: 36.8-65.8%) and 1.68 (95% CI: 0.97-2.92), respectively.

467017,Changes in drug use in European cities during early COVID-19 lockdowns - A snapshot from wastewater analysis,2021,"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 pandemic affects human health and the global economy. Its evolution is unpredictable, making it hard for governments to provide response actions suited for all populations. Meanwhile, informal street workers carry on with their labor despite contingency measures to sustain their lives. The objective was to conduct a case-control study to become aware of how street vendors' economy is affected during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODOLOGY: During phase 2 of the COVID-19 pandemic in a Mexican suburban city. We interviewed informal street vendors (cases) and formal employees (controls). RESULTS: Before mobility restrictions were in place, population income came 1.5% from formal employment and 23.5% from informal employment (street vendors). Informal employees lived on less than the equivalent of 1.5 Big Macs per day (p <0.001). After the contingency measures, formal employment kept the same, while the informal employment ratio increased to 57.4% (p < 0.001). The street vendors were almost 100-times less likely to be concerned about the coronavirus outbreak (p < 0.001) and were 38-times less likely to stop working compared with the formal workers (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We have proven that street vendors are a sector of the population that is highly vulnerable to significant economic loss due to contingency measures. Informal workers cannot stop working despite the ""Stay at Home"" initiative because the government has not implemented strategies that guarantee their survival and their families. Therefore, street vendors continue to be a source of the virus's spread throughout cities.","Romero-Michel, Jessica C; Mokay-Ramírez, Karen A; Delgado-Machuca, Marina; Delgado-Enciso, Josuel; Aurelien-Cabezas, Nomely S; Tiburcio-Jimenez, Daniel; Meza-Robles, Carmen; Delgado-Enciso, Osiris G; Guzman Esquivel, José; Zaizar-Fregoso, Sergio A; Martinez Fierro, Margarita L; Rodriguez Sanchez, Iram P; Melnikov, Valery; Barajas-Saucedo, Carlos E; Lara-Esqueda, Agustin; Delgado-Enciso, Ivan",J Infect Dev Ctries,,597
467210,Stigmas related to Covid-19 and their prevention,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered health-related anxiety in ways that undermine peoples' mental and physical health. Contextual factors such as living in a high-risk area might further increase the risk of health deterioration. Based on the Social Identity Approach, we argue that social identities can not only be local that are characterized by social interactions, but also be global that are characterized by a symbolic sense of togetherness and that both of these can be a basis for health. In line with these ideas, we tested how identification with one's family and with humankind relates to stress and physical symptoms while experiencing health-related anxiety and being exposed to contextual risk factors. We tested our assumptions in a representative sample (N = 974) two-wave survey study with a 4-week time lag. The results show that anxiety at Time 1 was positively related to stress and physical symptoms at Time 2. Feeling exposed to risk factors related to lower physical health, but was unrelated to stress. Family identification and identification with humankind were both negatively associated with subsequent stress and family identification was negatively associated with subsequent physical symptoms. These findings suggest that for social identities to be beneficial for mental health, they can be embodied as well as symbolic.","Frenzel, Svenja B; Junker, Nina M; Avanzi, Lorenzo; Bolatov, Aidos; Haslam, S Alexander; Häusser, Jan A; Kark, Ronit; Meyer, Ines; Mojzisch, Andreas; Monzani, Lucas; Reicher, Stephen; Samekin, Adil; Schury, Valerie A; Steffens, Niklas K; Sultanova, Liliya; Van Dijk, Dina; van Zyl, Llewellyn E; Van Dick, Rolf",Br. j. soc. psychol,,597

Recruitment and networking may be more influential in match outcomes than previous cycles. Medical residency training programs have significant challenges in recruiting diverse applicants. The American Psychiatric Association's Black Caucus developed a virtual recruitment event for residency programs with robust diversity initiatives and underrepresented medical students. This article evaluates our methods, short-term results, and influence on participating medical students. METHODS: The authors sent web-based invitations to all programs subscribed to the American Association of Directors of Psychiatric Residency Training listserv. Programs that demonstrated intention and commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion were selected. The authors used various social media platforms and the Black Caucus listserv to advertise to medical students. Student participants received an online feedback survey consisting of multiple-choice and open-ended questions. RESULTS: Thirty-six programs and one hundred seven medical students participated in the 2-day diversity fair. Seventy-six students completed the following survey, which is a response rate of 71%. A majority of students reported that this event strongly influenced their interest in a program (71.05) and are actively considering a residency program they had not previously considered (69.74). A majority of medical students (89.47) strongly agreed that program representatives treated them with professionalism and respect. CONCLUSION: This event improved communication between highly valued underrepresented minority students applicants and residency programs. A notable majority of participants found the program overwhelmingly beneficial.","Ojo, Enioluwafe; Hairston, Danielle",Acad. psychiatry,,597

The 2019-nCoV was different from SARS-CoV, but shared the same host receptor the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The natural host of 2019-nCoV may be the bat Rhinolophus affinis as 2019-nCoV showed 96.2% of whole-genome identity to BatCoV RaTG13. The person-to-person transmission routes of 2019-nCoV included direct transmission, such as cough, sneeze, droplet inhalation transmission, and contact transmission, such as the contact with oral, nasal, and eye mucous membranes. 2019-nCoV can also be transmitted through the saliva, and the fetal-oral routes may also be a potential person-to-person transmission route. The participants in dental practice expose to tremendous risk of 2019-nCoV infection due to the face-to-face communication and the exposure to saliva, blood, and other body fluids, and the handling of sharp instruments. Dental professionals play great roles in preventing the transmission of 2019-nCoV.

467967,IFSO Endoscopy Committee Position Statement on the Practice of Bariatric Endoscopy During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"OBJECTIVES: One important group of people at higher risk from the SARS-CoV-2(COVID-19) pandemic are those with autoimmune conditions including rheumatoid arthritis/inflammatory bowel disease. To minimise infection risk, many people have been switched from intravenous to subcutaneous biologics including biosimilars. DESIGN: The survey was designed to understand comparative economic issues related to the intravenous infusion vs subcutaneous biologic administration routes for infliximab. The survey focused on direct cost drivers/indirect cost drivers. Acquisition costs of medicines were not included due to data not being available publicly. Wider policy implications linked to the pandemic were also explored. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Semistructured single telephone interviews were carried out with twenty key stakeholders across the National Health Service(NHS) from 35 clinical/42 pharmacy/28 commissioning roles. The interviews were undertaken virtually during April 2020. From interview (n = 20) results, a simple cost analysis was developed plus a qualitative analysis of reports on wider policy/patient impacts. RESULTS: Key findings included evidence of significant variation in local infusion tariffs UK wide, with interviewees reporting that not all actual costs incurred are captured in published tariff costs. A cost analysis showed administration costs 50% lower in the subcutaneous compared to infusion routes, with most patients administering subcutaneous medicines themselves. Other indirect benefits to this route included less pressure on infusion unit waiting times/reduced risk of COVID-19 infection plus reduced patient 'out of pocket' costs. However, this was to some extent offset by increased pressure on home-care and community/primary care services. CONCLUSIONS: Switching from infusion to subcutaneous routes is currently driven by the COVID-19 pandemic in many services. A case for biologics (infusion vs subcutaneous) must be made on accurate real-world economic analysis. In an analysis of direct/indirect costs, excluding medicine acquisition costs, subcutaneous administration appears to be the more cost saving option for many patients even without the benefit of industry funded home-care. What's known One important group of people at high risk in COVID-19 pandemic are those with autoimmune conditions, including those with rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. Depending on the complexity of their condition, some of the patients in this group may be receiving intravenous biologic infusion therapy which under normal circumstances is administered within a hospital or day hospital setting. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has published new guidance to ensure that patients having intravenous treatment are assessed for possible switching to the same treatment in subcutaneous form. What's new A cost analysis showed that administration costs for subcutananous routes are 50% lower than for infusion routes, with most patients administering subcutaneous medicines themselves. Other indirect benefits to this route included less pressure on infusion unit waiting times and reduced risk of COVID-19 infection, along with reduced patient costs. Cost savings were partly offset by increased pressure on home-care and community/primary care services.","Heald, Adrian; Bramham-Jones, Steven; Davies, Mark",Int J Clin Pract,,597

Novel agents such as 18F DOPA and 68Ga DOTATATE are being used nowadays in academic centers. During the COVID-19 pandemic, procurement of MIBG has proved particularly challenging, necessitating the use of 68Ga DOTATATE positron emission tomography. Methods: 68Ga DOTATATE PET/CT imaging was carried out for staging of three pediatric patients with Neuroblastoma at our institution. A review of the literature was also completed. Results: 68Ga-DOTATATE is FDA approved for imaging of somatostatin receptor (SSTR) positive gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. 68Ga DOTATATE PET/CT scans were successfully carried out in all patients. All patients showed DOTATATE avid disease. PET scans showed excellent spatial resolution and demonstrated high accuracy in concordance with current EANM guidelines. Conclusion: We have presented 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT imaging believe it can be reliably used as an alternative to MIBG for staging of neuroblastoma. Its advantages include technical, clinical and practical advantages making it an attractive option.

This study investigated the correlation between differentially expressed proteins in serum and CP induced by all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) in mice. We studied 80 mice in the following groups: male mice (male; n = 6), nonpregnant female control mice (NP-CRL; n = 6), healthy pregnant controls (P-CRL; Con; n = 24), pregnant mice with CP induced by atRA (n = 24), or pregnant mice with CP induced by TCDD (TCDD; n = 20). Pregnant mice were given with atRA (100 mg/kg) or TCDD (40 µg/kg), or corn oil by oral gavage at E10.5. The serum samples were collected and eight proteins-including interleukin (IL)-12p40, IL-12p70, receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), interferon (IFN)-Î³, IFN-ß, IL-10, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and epiregulin-were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Placental tissues were immunostained for IL-12p40 and RAGE from stages E13.5 to E16.5. In P-CRL mice, serum IL-12p40 was significantly increased at E13.5 and declined over E14.5-E16.5. P-CRL had lower IFN-Î³ levels at E13.5 compared with NP-CRL. The CP groups showed lower concentrations of IL-12p40 at E13.5-E14.5 and clearly higher concentrations of soluble RAGE (sRAGE) at E13.5 when compared with P-CRL. IL-12p40 immunostaining clearly decreased in placental tissue sections obtained from E13.5 to E14.5 in both CP groups. These findings suggest that reduced levels of IL-12p40 and increased levels of sRAGE in serum may be correlated with chemically induced CP in mice, but further studies would be required to establish this.","Wang, X-H; Peng, Y; Meng, L-Y",Hum Exp Toxicol,,597

We hypothesized that continued lockdowns might be associated with increased feelings of aggression. Methods: Over the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (BPAQ) was administered to a total of 5,928 adults distributed proportionally from across the United States during independent online cross-sectional surveys collected each month. Data across the 6-month period were compared between those under lockdown versus those not under such restrictions. Results: BPAQ Total Aggression scores showed a significant main effect for both month and lockdown status as well as a significant interaction effect, with increasing scores evident for those reporting that they were under lockdown relative to those reporting no restrictions. This same pattern was evident for all four subscales of the BPAQ, including Physical Aggression, Verbal Aggression, Anger, and Hostility. Limitations: Random sampling of the entire population was not possible, so generalization of the results should be made with caution. Additionally, data were collected cross-sectionally and cannot be considered to reflect longitudinal change within individuals. Finally, the cross-sectional survey design means that it is impossible to infer that the lockdowns caused the increase in aggression. Conclusions: Lockdowns were associated with elevated levels of aggression that were higher in later months of the national pandemic response.","Killgore, William D S; Cloonan, Sara A; Taylor, Emily C; Anlap, Ian; Dailey, Natalie S",J Affect Disord Rep,,597

However, the chronology of these effects is not yet fully understood. This study aimed to establish the early sequential effects of heat stress in bull sperm quality. Semen and blood samples of Nellore breed bulls were collected and distributed into control and testicular heat stress (scrotal bags/96 h) groups. Semen samples were evaluated for sperm motility, abnormalities, plasma membrane integrity, acrosomal membrane integrity, mitochondrial membrane potential, sperm lipid peroxidation, seminal plasma lipid peroxidation, and DNA fragmentation. Blood plasma was also evaluated for lipid peroxidation. An increase in sperm abnormalities was observed 7 days following heat stress. After 14 days, sperm lipid peroxidation increased and mitochondrial membrane function, sperm motility, and plasma membrane integrity decreased. Heat stress effects were still observed after 21 days following heat stress. An increase in sperm DNA fragmentation was observed as a late effect after 28 days. Thus, the initial effects of heat stress (i.e., increasing sperm abnormalities and lipid peroxidation) suggest the presence of oxidative stress in the semen that alters mitochondrial function, sperm motility, plasma membrane integrity, and belatedly, DNA fragmentation. Although sperm abnormalities persisted and increased over time, sperm lipid peroxidation, in turn, increased only until 21 days after heat stress. In this regard, these findings provide a greater understanding of the chronological effects of experimentally induced heat stress on bovine sperm, providing valuable insights about spermatogenesis during the first 28 days following heat stress.","Garcia-Oliveros, Laura Nataly; de Arruda, Rubens Paes; Batissaco, Leonardo; Gonzaga, Vitor Hugo Guilger; Nogueira, Vinícius José Moreira; Florez-Rodriguez, Shirley Andrea; Almeida, Flávia Dos Santos; Alves, Maíra Bianchi Rodrigues; Pinto, Sâmara Cristine Costa; Nichi, Marcilio; Losano, João Diego de Agostini; Kawai, Giulia Kiyomi Vechiato; Celeghini, Eneiva Carla Carvalho",Int. j. biometeorol,,597

Objectives of the study were to investigate the effect of quarantine on sleep quality (SQ) and body mass index (BMI), and if change in SQ was related to working modalities. MATERIALS: We enrolled 121 adults (age 44.9 ± 13.3 years and 35.5% males). Anthropometric parameters, working modalities and physical activity were studied. Sleep quality was evaluated by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire. At baseline, the enrolled subjects were assessed in outpatient clinic and after 40 days of quarantine/lockdown by phone interview. RESULTS: Overall, 49.6% of the subjects were good sleepers (PSQI < 5) at the baseline and significantly decreased after quarantine (p < 0.001). In detail, sleep onset latency (p < 0.001), sleep efficiency (p = 0.03), sleep disturbances (p < 0.001), and daytime dysfunction (p < 0.001) significantly worsened. There was also a significant increase in BMI values in normal weight (p = 0.023), in subjects grade I (p = 0.027) and II obesity (p = 0.020). In all cohort, physical activity was significantly decreased (p = 0.004). However, analyzing the data according gender difference, males significantly decreased physical activity as well as females in which there was only a trend without reaching statistical significance (53.5% vs 25.6%; p = 0.015 and 50.0% vs 35.9%, p = 0.106; in males and females, respectively). In addition, smart working activity resulted in a significant worsening of SQ, particularly in males (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Quarantine was associated to a worsening of SQ, particularly in males doing smart working, and to an increase in BMI values.","Barrea, Luigi; Pugliese, Gabriella; Framondi, Lydia; Di Matteo, Rossana; Laudisio, Daniela; Savastano, Silvia; Colao, Annamaria; Muscogiuri, Giovanna",J Transl Med,,597
471279,Gastrointestinal endoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic: an updated review of guidelines and statements from international and national societies,2020,"A recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel coronavirus designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019 and then spread rapidly all over the world. However, there are no specific antiviral therapies for COVID-19, using the agents which approved or in development for other viral infections is one of the potentially quickest ways to find treatment for this new viral infection. Favipiravir is an effective agent that acts as a nucleotide analog that selectively inhibits the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase or causes lethal mutagenesis upon incorporation into the virus RNA. In view of recent studies and discussion on favipiravir, in this mini review we aimed to summarize the clinical trials studying the efficacy and safety of favipiravir in patients with COVID-19.","Ghasemnejad-Berenji, Morteza; Pashapour, Sarvin","Drug res.

471280,Gastrointestinal endoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic: an updated review of guidelines and statements from international and national societies,2020,"BACKGROUND: Globally, antibiotics misuse by the public has been reported in the era of COVID-19, despite the discouraging instructions of the World Health Organization, especially for mild cases. OBJECTIVE: Is to describe this antibiotic misuse and its contributing factors. Also, to measure the pharmacists' application of infection preventive practices during the pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among randomly selected Egyptian community pharmacists (Center, East, Delta, and Upper Egypt) using a questionnaire and direct interviews from 1 to 30 August 2020. The questionnaire consisted of two parts, the first covered pharmacist's demographic data and their application of basic infection preventive practices (eg, wearing face masks, regular hand sanitization, etc), and the other part was related to antibiotic dispensing patterns. Data were descriptively analyzed and the impact of participant experience on the responses was evaluated using the &#967;2 test. RESULTS: From 480 randomly selected Egyptian community pharmacists, 413 (87%) consented to participate in the study. 86.7% of the participants were keen to wear face masks (n = 358) and 86.2% kept regular hand sanitization (n = 356); whereas, 46.9% (n = 194) maintained adequate antibiotic stock supply during the pandemic. Nearly 67% (n = 275) of the pharmacists reported that patients were more likely to be given antibiotics for showing any sign or symptom of COVID-19 infection, and 82% (n = 74 278) of the dispensed antibiotics were given upon physician recommendation. Azithromycin, Ceftriaxone, and Linezolid were the major antibiotics dispensed to COVID-19 presumptive patients Azithromycin was given to ~40% of presumptive patients showing only mild or moderate symptoms for 5-10 days. Additionally, antibiotic combinations were given to 74% (n = 62 479) of home-isolated patients for a maximum of 2 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacists applied suitable sanitation and infection control protocols. Meanwhile, antibiotics were dispensed heavily during this pandemic without proper clinical indication and for long durations supporting the idea of antibiotic misuse.","Elsayed, Asmaa A; Darwish, Samar F; Zewail, Moataz B; Mohammed, Marwa; Saeed, Haitham; Rabea, Hoda",Int J Clin Pract,,597

The COVID-19 traffic spike across e-commerce portals puts further pressure on computer network component vendors and raises the bar regarding both performance and reliability. Therefore, the authors undertake a challenge of identifying factors influencing the level of Cisco switches acceptance among network administrators in business environments. To achieve that, Structural Equation Modelling is introduced. The feedback gathered from 205 study contributors enabled the authors to evaluate the significance of two domain-specific factors-Technological Innovation (TI) and Availability of Professional Training (APT). The APT was confirmed to have a significant impact on networking hardware acceptance. The study contributes to extending the decision-making rationale regarding the procurement of networking switches and shows the added value of technology-oriented professional training for job satisfaction and working efficiency.","Ostrowski, P.; Wrycza, S.; Gajda, D.; Marcinkowski, B.",Journal of Theoretical and Applied Electronic Commerce Research,,597

473150,A model of workflow in the hospital during a pandemic to assist management,2020,"Compared to the US-born population, Hispanic immigrants are reported to have lower age-adjusted prevalence of hypertension. However, country of origin, race/ethnicity, and risk behaviors associated with acculturation, including hazardous drinking, can affect the prevalence of hypertension. Additionally, health disparities across immigration/nativity status may be associated with suboptimal antihypertensive treatment and control of hypertension. In the present study, population-based data from the years 2016 to 2018 of the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) were analyzed to assess the association of nativity status and hazardous drinking with hypertension among US-born and foreign-born Hispanic populations. Age-adjusted prevalence of past-year hypertension among foreign-born Hispanics was lower than US-born Hispanics. However, the proportion of Hispanic immigrants who had their blood pressure checked by a healthcare professional was also smaller than US-born Hispanics, suggesting that the prevalence of hypertension among Hispanic immigrants may be underreported. Hazardous drinking was associated with decreased odds of antihypertensive treatment among the Hispanic immigrants.","Arasteh, Kamyar",J. racial ethnic health disparities (Internet),,597

474454,Lipoprotein(a) and Its Potential Association with Thrombosis and Inflammation in COVID-19: a Testable Hypothesis,2020,"Flipped teaching (FT) is known to foster active learning and increase student engagement. The flipped classroom design organizes learning in such a way that the lower-order thinking such as memorization is expected at the individual student level in the form of homework and the higher-order thinking including application and analysis occurs in the classroom in the presence of the instructor. With the sudden onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, instructors and students were given no time to adjust to the remote educational set up. Flipped teaching, like most other instructional modalities, had to be transformed into an online platform. The present study assessed the effectiveness of FT in a remote setting in a graduate-level physiology course (n=33). The course content included lecture videos, slides, and reading assignments which were made available on BlackBoard, the Learning Management System. Students were expected to have reviewed the assigned content prior to the virtual synchronous sessions. During the synchronous meeting, a question-answer (Q&A) session allowed students to review the content yet again. Followed by the Q&A session, an individual quiz, containing lower-order questions, was given to assess student preparation. Soon after the review of the quiz, students in small groups (4-5 students per group) were allowed to use breakout rooms to complete a set of questions which were designed at the higher order of Bloom's taxonomy and expected students to apply knowledge, analyze or synthesize their collaborative responses. The answers to these questions were reviewed during the first part of the following synchronous session where students were selected randomly to answer these questions which prompted them to come prepared. Student surveys were administered at the beginning and the end of the course to assess their knowledge gain, perception of the remote FT format, and confidence in completing the course. Based on the survey results, it was found that the students adjusted well to the remote course setting (p&lt;0.001) and their confidence in completing the course successfully increased from the beginning to the end of the semester (p&lt;0.05). Students also found that the collaborative activities (93.55%) and the in-class discussions (96.77%) were effective and were well adjusted to the synchronous computerized exams (90.32%) and the individual in-class assessments (80.65%). Overall, the remote FT method was successful and therefore, the principles behind FT could be employed in virtual teaching.","Gopalan, Chaya",The FASEB Journal,,597

Results: Overall, almost three quarters (71%) of the participants chose the 80-year-old patient with a diagnosis of AD to be the last to be provided with a ventilator. The preferences of the remaining quarter were divided between the 80-year-old person who was cognitively intact and the 55-year-old person with AD. Education and subjective knowledge about AD were significantly associated with participants' preferences.

The purpose of this review was to discuss the incidence, characteristics, diagnostic criteria, biomarkers, and outcomes of hospitalized patients diagnosed with CAPA. A literature search was performed through Pubmed and Web of Science databases for articles published up to 20th March 2021. In 1421 COVID-19 patients, the overall CAPA incidence was 13.5% (range 2.5-35.0%). The majority required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). The time to CAPA diagnosis from illness onset varied between 8.0 and 16.0 days. However, the time to CAPA diagnosis from intensive care unit (ICU) admission and IMV initiation ranged between 4.0-15.0 days and 3.0-8.0 days. The most common diagnostic criteria were the modified AspICU-Dutch/Belgian Mycosis Study Group and IAPA-Verweij et al. A total of 77.6% of patients had positive lower respiratory tract cultures, other fungal biomarkers of bronchoalveolar lavage and serum galactomannan were positive in 45.3% and 18.2% of patients. The CAPA mortality rate was high at 48.4%, despite the widespread use of antifungals. Lengthy hospital and ICU stays ranging between 16.0-37.5 days and 10.5-37.0 days were observed. CAPA patients had prolonged IMV duration of 13.0-20.0 days. The true incidence of CAPA likely remains unknown as the diagnosis is limited by the lack of standardized diagnostic criteria that rely solely on microbiological data with direct or indirect detection of Aspergillus in respiratory specimens, particularly in clinical conditions with a low pretest probability.

475773,The impact of Covid-19 on the alternative fuels industry,2020,"Interferon (IFN)-λ plays an essential role in mucosal cells which exhibit strong antiviral activity. Lactobacillus plantarum (L. plantarum) has substantial application potential in the food and medical industries because of its probiotic properties. Alphacoronaviruses, especially porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), cause high morbidity and mortality in piglets resulting in economic loss. Co-infection by these two viruses is becoming increasingly frequent. Therefore, it is particularly important to develop a new drug to prevent diarrhea infected with mixed viruses in piglets. In this study, we first constructed an anchored expression vector with CWA (C-terminal cell wall anchor) on L. plantarum. Second, we constructed two recombinant L. plantarum strains that anchored IFN-λ3 via pgsA (N-terminal transmembrane anchor) and CWA. Third, we demonstrated that both recombinant strains possess strong antiviral effects against coronavirus infection in the intestinal porcine epithelial cell line J2 (IPEC-J2). However, recombinant L. plantarum with the CWA anchor exhibited a more powerful antiviral effect than recombinant L. plantarum with pgsA. Consistent with this finding, Lb.plantarum-pSIP-409-IFNλ3-CWA enhanced the expression levels of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) (ISG15, OASL, and Mx1) in IPEC-J2 cells more than did recombinant Lb.plantarum-pSIP-409-pgsA'-IFN-λ3. Our study verifies that recombinant L. plantarum inhibits PEDV and TGEV infection in IPEC-J2 cells, which may offer great potential for use as a novel oral antiviral agent in therapeutic applications for combating porcine epidemic diarrhea and transmissible gastroenteritis. This study is the first to show that recombinant L. plantarum suppresses PEDV and TGEV infection of IPEC-J2 cells.","Liu, Yong-Shi; Liu, Qiong; Jiang, Yan-Long; Yang, Wen-Tao; Huang, Hai-Bin; Shi, Chun-Wei; Yang, Gui-Lian; Wang, Chun-Feng",J.

Notably, hydroxychloroquine has been associated with a heterogeneous range of cutaneous and extra-cutaneous adverse events. We carried out a narrative review of the literature up to November 1st, 2020, related to the safety of hydroxychloroquine. In particular, cutaneous and extra-cutaneous adverse events associated with hydroxychloroquine were reviewed. The following databases were consulted: PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar and ResearchGate. The research of articles was conducted by using the following search terms: ''hydroxychloroquine,"" ''adverse event/effect,'' ""cutaneous"", ""skin"", ""cardiotoxicity"", ""retinopathy"", gastrointestinal and neurological toxicity"". The main indication for which hydroxychloroquine was used in the reports was an immune mediated disorder. Adverse events were described mostly in females over 50 years of age. The most common cutaneous adverse effect was maculopapular and erythematous rash occurring within 4 weeks of initiating hydroxychloroquine and disappearing within few weeks of discontinuation. Gastrointestinal symptoms and headache were the most frequent extracutaneous manifestations. Rarer cutaneous manifestations include hyperpigmentation, psoriasiform dermatitis, photodermatitis, stomatitis, melanonychia and hair loss. More severe conditions were acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis, and among extra-cutaneous adverse events cardiotoxicity and retinopathy. Since hydroxychloroquine is widely prescribed in rheumatology, it is important for rheumatologists to be familiar with its safety profile.","Gisondi, Paolo; Piaserico, Stefano; Bordin, Chiara; Bellinato, Francesco; Tozzi, Francesca; Alaibac, Mauro; Girolomoni, Giampiero; Naldi, Luigi",Clin. exp. rheumatol,,597

It is unclear how long it will take for transit to recover and whether transit will emerge fundamentally transformed for better or worse after the pandemic. This research aims to collect first-hand data about travel behavior decision-making process among downtown Minneapolis commuters -- one of the largest groups of potential transit users in the Twin Cities metropolitan region -- after the pandemic is largely contained and the stay-at-home order is lifted in the region. The research team will recruit a diverse sample of downtown commuters (N=500) virtually through various forms of digital marketing tools such as website, social media, email, and online video. Interested participants will be asked to install a mobile app from the Google Play Store (for Android) or iOS App Store (for iPhone) that semi-automatically collects daily activity-travel behavior. The app will be customized to have built-in survey functions to trigger context-specific questions about how participants make various trip decisions, e.g., trip cancellation, trip generation, mode choice, route choice, and destination choice;and how their COVID-19 experiences play a role in shaping these trip decisions. Such context-specific and decision-level data will be used to develop statistical models to provide deep insights into how the mobility impacts of COVID-19 may differ by individual socio-demographics and trip environments. Results from the research will help transportation planners and engineers to identify innovative and sensible ways to effectively promote the use of public transportation in the post-pandemic era.","Fan, Yingling",,,597
478168,Motherhood and medicine in the time of COVID-19,2021,"OBJECTIVES: To examine severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant replacement in association with containment capacity and changes in case fatality at country level. METHODS: Altogether, 69 571 full SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected globally within the first 6 months of the pandemic were examined. The correlation between variant replacement and containment capacity was examined by logistic regression models using the WHO International Health Regulation (IHR) score, the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) and the vulnerability index INFORM as proxies, while correlation with changes in monthly crude case fatality ratios was examined by a mixed effect model. RESULTS: At the global level, variant lineage G&#8727;, characterized by the S-D614G mutation, replaced the older lineages L and S in March 2020. European countries-including Finland, France and Italy-were the first to reach a 50% increment of G&#8727;, whereas only Singapore and South Korea had non-G&#8727; persisting throughout the first 6 months. Countries with higher IHR scores (ß-coefficient -0.001, 95%CI -0.016, -0.001; p 0.034) and higher stringency indexes (OxCGRT) (ß-coefficient -0.011, 95%CI -0.020, -0.001; p 0.035) were associated with lower levels of G&#8727; replacement, whereas higher vulnerability indexes (INFORM) (ß-coefficient 0.049, 95%CI 0.001, 0.097; p 0.044) were associated with higher replacement levels. Crude case fatality ratio showed a positive correlation with G&#8727; replacement (ß-coefficient: 0.034, 95%CI 0.011, 0.058; p 0.004), even after adjusting for testing capacity and other country-specific characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 variant lineage G&#8727; (S-D614G) replaced older lineages more efficiently in countries with lower containment capacity, and its possible association with increased disease severity deserves further investigation.","Chen, Zigui; Chong, Ka Chun; Wong, Martin C S; Boon, Siaw S; Huang, Junjie; Wang, Maggie H; Ng, Rita W Y; Lai, Christopher K C; Chan, Paul K S",Clin. microbiol. infect,,597

Such diseases are of particular danger during mass gathering and mass influx events, as large crowds of people in close proximity to each other creates optimal opportunities for disease transmission. The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia are two countries that have witnessed mass gatherings due to the arrival of Syrian refugees and the annual Hajj season. The mass migration of people not only brings exotic diseases to these regions but also brings new diseases back to their own countries, e.g., the outbreak of MERS in South Korea. Many emerging pathogens originate in bats, and more than 30 bat species have been identified in these two countries. Some of those bat species are known to carry viruses that cause deadly diseases in other parts of the world, such as the rabies virus and coronaviruses. However, little is known about bats and the pathogens they carry in Jordan and Saudi Arabia. Here, the importance of enhanced surveillance of bat-borne infections in Jordan and Saudi Arabia is emphasized, promoting the awareness of bat-borne diseases among the general public and building up infrastructure and capability to fill the gaps in public health preparedness to prevent future pandemics.","Al-Eitan, Laith N; Tarkhan, Amneh H; Alghamdi, Mansour A; Marston, Denise A; Wu, Guanghui; McElhinney, Lorraine M; Brown, Ian H; Fooks, Anthony R",Viruses,,597

The disease causes a range of respiratory illnesses, which are fatal. The COVID-19 disease has spread globally and has significantly impacted the health delivery systems, travel regulations, and economic activities and has posed and upsurge of responsibilities for the frontline healthcare workers. Due to the nature of the COVID-19 disease, it has typically caused complications which include pneumonia, multiple organ dysfunction together with renal failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. As of date, there is no approved vaccine or treatment for COVID-19 though there are ongoing research studies to formulate a treatment. COVID-19 is highly contagious, and the risk of infection is higher for patients with immunesuppressed patients than regular patients. The immunesuppressed conditions include cancer, HIV, and patients with solid organ transplants (SOT). This paper aims to review the risk and impact of COVID-19 on immunesuppressed patients, with a focus on cancer, HIV, and patients with SOT and the essence of special parameters for their care and management. Despite the fatal effects of this global pandemic, the findings of this study indicate the high risk which immunosuppressed patients have to contract the disease; thus, the governments and health delivery systems have to offer them extra support and treatment.","Mohammed, Ali Haider; Blebil, Ali; Dujaili, Juman; Rasool-Hassan, Bassam A",AIDS Rev,,597

However, there is limited literature detailing the longitudinal performance of EUA-cleared serologic assays in US populations, particularly in cohorts with a remote history of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (e.g., > 2 months). METHODS: We evaluated the diagnostic sensitivities and specificities of the Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (anti-N) and Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S (anti-S1-RBD) assays, using 174 residual clinical samples up to 267 days post-PCR diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 154) and a subset of samples obtained prior to the COVID-19 pandemic as negative controls (n = 20). RESULTS: The calculated diagnostic sensitivities for the anti-N and anti-S1-RBD assays were 89% and 93%, respectively. Of the 154 samples in the SARS-CoV-2-positive cohort, there were 6 discrepant results between the anti-N and anti-S1-RBD assays, 5 of which were specimens collected &#8805; 200 days post-PCR positivity and only had detectable levels of anti-S1-RBD antibodies. When only considering specimens collected &#8805; 100 days post-PCR positivity (n = 41), the sensitivities for the anti-N and anti-S1-RBD assays were 85% and 98%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The anti-S1-RBD assay demonstrated superior sensitivity at time points more remote to the PCR detection date, with 6 more specimens from the SARS-CoV-2-positive cohort detected, 5 of which were collected more than 200 days post-PCR positivity. While analytical differences and reagent lot-to-lot variability are possible, this may indicate that, in some instances, anti-S1-RBD antibodies may persist longer in vivo and may be a better target for detecting remote SARS-CoV-2 infection.","El-Khoury, Joe M; Schulz, Wade L; Durant, Thomas J S",,,597

482069,Exploring the Impact of COVID-19 on Progress Towards Achieving Global Surgery Goals,2020,"O coronavírus bovino (BCoV) e rotavírus (RV) são importantes agentes da diarréia neonatal bovina, causando grandes perdas econômicas. O BCoV é também responsável pela disenteria de inverno em vacas adultas e por desordens respiratórias e o RV possui um aspecto zoonótico de importância na saúde pública. Este estudo teve o objetivo de desenvolver uma multiplex hemi-nested RT-PCR para detecção simultânea de BCoV e RV do grupo A com a utilização de um controle interno. Para tanto, foram desenhados três primers dirigidos ao gene N de BCoV (306pb) e três primers dirigidos ao gene VP1 do RV do grupo A (228pb); para o controle interno, foram utilizados dois primers dirigidos ao mRNA do gene mitocondrial bovino ND5 (191pb). Foram utilizados como controles positivos a amostra Kakegawa de BCoV (título HA de 256), a amostra 8209 de rotavírus do grupo A (título viral de 101.66TCID50%/200µL) e suspensão de células MDBK para o controle interno. A extração de RNA foi realizada com o reagente comercial TRIzol, de acordo com as recomendações do fabricante. Foram realizados gradientes de temperatura para a determinação da temperatura ótima de hibridação para cada par de primers, resultando em 50ºC para PCR e 55ºC para a hemi-nested. Doze protocolos com diferentes concentrações de Taq DNA polymerase, MgCl2, primers e DNA-alvo foram testados. Para determinação do limiar de detecção, o protocolo final foi utilizado em diluições dos dois vírus em suspensão de amostras fecais negativas para BCoV e RV adicionadas de 10% de suspensão de células MDBK, obtendo o limiar de detecção de 10-8 para os dois vírus e aplicado em amostras fecais de bezerros (53) e vacas adultas (22). Todas as amostras foram previamente testadas para BCoV por uma nested RT-PCR dirigida ao gene RdPd, sendo 15 positivas, e para rotavírus pela PAGE, sendo 3 positivas. Para a multiplex, 15 amostras foram positivas para BCoV e 6 para rotavírus. O seqüenciamento de DNA das amostras positivas para multiplex demonstrou a especificidade do teste. Uma concordância ótima foi encontrada para BCoV (0,833) e substancial para rotavírus (0,648) calculada pela estatística kappa, comparando-se com os testes de referência. Estes resultados demonstram que a padronização da multiplex foi eficiente para a detecção de BCoV e RV, com elevadas sensibilidade e especificidade. Além disso, o diagnóstico simultâneo dos dois agentes permite um diagnóstico rápido e a um menor custo devido à utilização de reduzidas quantidades de reagentes e mão de obra, fornecendo uma importante ferramenta para o diagnóstico e estudo da etiologia da diarréia em bovinos","Asano, Karen Miyuki",,,597
482377,There is a real danger that covid-19 will become entrenched as a disease of poverty,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has strained health care system resources and reduced the availability of life-sustaining and medical-grade personal protective equipment (PPE) though the combination of increased demand and disrupted manufacturing supply chains. As a result of these shortages, many health care providers have temporarily used largely untested, improvised PPE (iPPE). Lack of quality control for makeshift PPE and frequent repurposing of used items to conserve supplies increase both the risk of provider infection and nosocomial spread to uninfected patients. One strategy to reduce risk of infection and preserve existing equipment is the implementation of secondary barrier devices placed directly over patients or providers. The authors describe an inexpensive, disposable, positive-pressure head isolation unit that can be rapidly constructed from materials readily available in nearly all health care settings for under five US dollars. The unit was successfully deployed in Taiwan during the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak, and again during the COVID-19 pandemic. The iPPE worn directly by the health care workers (HCWs) can be donned prior to patient contact in the presence of an air source. This strategy may be more protective than a covering placed over the patient in an aerosol-generating environment, which requires the HCW to be in close contact with the patient prior to securing the protective device.","Chien, Li-Chien; Beÿ, Christian K; Koenig, Kristi L",Prehosp Disaster Med,,597

This study assesses the associations of age, gender, and level of education with vaccine acceptance, from a random sample of 13,426 participants selected from 19 high-COVID-19 burden countries in June 2020. Based on univariable and multivariable logistic regression, several noteworthy trends emerged: women in France, Germany, Russia, and Sweden were significantly more likely to accept a vaccine than men in these countries. Older (&#8805;50) people in Canada, Poland, France, Germany, Sweden, and the UK were significantly more favorably disposed to vaccination than younger respondents, but the reverse trend held in China. Highly educated individuals in Ecuador, France, Germany, India, and the US reported that they will accept a vaccine, but higher education levels were associated with lower vaccination acceptance in Canada, Spain, and the UK. Heterogeneity by demographic factors in the respondents' willingness to accept a vaccine if recommended by employers were substantial when comparing responses from Brazil, Ecuador, France, India, Italy, Mexico, Poland, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Sweden, and the US.

This Swedish pilot study aimed to: (i) assess the proportion of preschoolers meeting the guidelines, (ii) evaluate the feasibility of the methods for the SUNRISE study, and (iii) assess how movement behaviors have been affected in preschoolers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Physical activity and sleep (waist-worn ActiGraph); screen time and movement behaviors (parental questionnaire); motor skills (Ages and Stages Questionnaire); and executive functions (3 iPad games) were assessed in 100 Swedish preschoolers (n = 58 boys). There were 19.4% of preschoolers (n = 14) who met the WHO guidelines. The motor skill and executive function assessments were feasible; however, 20% refused to wear the ActiGraph overnight.

We study a setting where ICU resources are constrained while suppression is costly (e.g., limiting economic interaction). Providing a fully analytical solution we show that the common wisdom of""flattening the curve"", where suppression measures are continuously taken to hold down the spread throughout the epidemic, is suboptimal. Instead, the optimal suppression is discontinuous. The epidemic should be left unregulated in a first phase and when the ICU constraint is approaching society should quickly lock down (a discontinuity). After the lockdown regulation should gradually be lifted, holding the rate of infected constant thus respecting the ICU resources while not unnecessarily limiting economic activity. In a final phase, regulation is lifted. We call this strategy""filling the box"".","Miclo, Laurent; Spiro, Daniel; Weibull, Jorgen",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.01327v1.pdf,597

Hospitals responded by expanding services to accommodate the forecasted rise in COVID-19-related admissions. We describe the effects these changes had on management of orthopaedic trauma and patient outcomes at a district general hospital in Southern England. Methods: Data were extrapolated retrospectively from two separate 6-week periods in 2019 and 2020 (1st April-13th May) using electronic records of patients referred to the orthopaedic team. Soft tissue injuries were included where a confirmed diagnosis was made with radiological evidence. Patients were excluded if no orthopaedic intervention was required. Data were compared between the two time periods. Results: There were fewer attendances to hospital in 2020 compared with 2019 (178 vs. 328), but time from presentation to surgery significantly increased in 2020 (2.94 days vs. 4.91 days, p = 0.009). There were fewer operative complications in 2020 (36/145 vs. 11/88, p < 0.001). However, ordinal logistic regression analysis found a significantly greater complication severity in 2020 including death (p = 0.039). Complication severity was unrelated to COVID-19 status. Conclusions: Restructuring of orthopaedic services in response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with significant delays to surgery and higher post-operative complication severity. Our results demonstrate the need for fast-track emergency operative orthopaedic services in UK district general hospitals whilst the COVID-19 pandemic continues.","Patel, B A; Green, S F; Henessy, C; Adamu-Biu, F; Davda, K; Chennagiri, R; Kankate, R; Ghani, Y",Indian J Orthop,,597

Relaying real time audio and video over distance is inherently productive. However, it lacks the sense of in-person interaction. With the current global pandemic, additional privacy concerns over the extended use of video and audio-conferencing systems, there is a need to redefine how VC Systems function and what information they communicate. To resolve these issues, we propose a VC system that utilizes facial recognition to identify and catalog participant’s expressions and communicates their emotional states to other participants on the VC system using encoded haptic cues. In our testing we found that the approach was able to provide summarized haptic feedback of facial expressions and reduce the time it took for the participants to react to ongoing discussions without increasing mental or physical strain on the user. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Farooq, A.; Radivojevic, Z.; Mlakar, P.; Raisamo, R.","4th International Conference on Human Interaction and Emerging Technologies: Future Applications, IHIET – AI 2021",,597

Herein, a low-cost and eco-friendly separation layer with a rough structure and rich anionic groups was fabricated from rice straw (RS) via a simple acid-base treatment and slight squeeze process. The separation layer's morphology, composition, and wettability were investigated. It was then employed to separate oil-in-water emulsion. The RS after acid and alkali treatment (A1A2-RS) exhibited a clear fiber structure and abundant humps, which made the separation layer superwettable and highly electronegative (-26.55 mV). The overlapped and intertwined A1A2-RS layer structure owned a superior performance for hexadecyl-trimethyl-ammonium-bromide (CTAB) adsorption and tiny oil interception. As a result, the separation layer had stable fluxes (>500 LMH) for multiple CTAB-stabilized emulsions and the obtained filtrates performed low total organic carbon (TOC) contents (<30 mg/L). In addition, the A1A2-RS layer had excellent renewability (10 cycles/ 200 mL) and the flux could be substantially recovered merely by aqueous wash. Moreover, filtrate analysis showed that the A1A2-RS layer had a good effect on actual emulsion treatment with a TOC removal rate of 89.56%.","Feng, Lidong; Gao, Yue; Dai, Zhenguo; Dan, Hongbing; Xiao, Fang; Yue, Qinyan; Gao, Baoyu; Wang, Shuguang",J Hazard Mater,,597

Timing of an asthma event is extremely important and lack of identification of asthma increases the risk of death. A major challenge for health systems is the length of time between symptom onset and care seeking, which could result in delayed treatment initiation and worsening of symptoms. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the utility of the internet search query data for the identification of the onset of asthma symptoms. METHODS: Pearson correlation coefficients between the time series of hospital admissions and Google searches were computed at lag times from 4 weeks before hospital admission to 4 weeks after hospital admission. An autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMAX) model with an autoregressive process at lags of 1 and 2 and Google searches at weeks -1 and -2 as exogenous variables were conducted to validate our correlation results. RESULTS: Google search volume for asthma had the highest correlation at 2 weeks before hospital admission. The ARIMAX model using an autoregressive process showed that the relative searches from Google about asthma were significant at lags 1 (P<.001) and 2 (P=.04). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that internet search queries may provide a real-time signal for asthma events and may be useful to measure the timing of symptom onset.","Hswen, Yulin; Zhang, Amanda; Ventelou, Bruno",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,597

487830,"Nurses' challenges, concerns and unfair requirements during the COVID-19 outbreak",2021,"International commerce and travel have been restricted in order to limit the spread of COVID-19. The illegal trafficking in drugs, which is often concealed in other commercial activity, will be affected by these disruptions. This is particularly true for precursor chemicals, controlled substances of synthetic origin, and new psychoactive substances coming from Asia. China hosts large and under-regulated pharmaceutical and chemical sectors that provide many of the active ingredients used both in legitimate medicines and illicit fentanyl and methamphetamine. Unregulated producers and vendors in China have been supplying drug trafficking organizations in Mexico or using the internet and postal service to directly sell fentanyl to buyers in North America. The magnitude of supply shortages and interrupted trade of chemicals and synthetic drugs coming from China will depend on the breadth and depth of COVID-19's disruptions. In turn, this could impact vulnerable drug-using populations. Drawing on historical accounts of prior supply disruptions, this commentary offers some initial speculation as to the possible effects of COVID-19 on the supply of synthetic drugs like fentanyl and precursor chemicals supplied to North America from China, which may have important lessons for other parts of the globe. Prior supply disruptions coincided with elevated prices and reduced purities of street drugs as well as increases in the number of users entering treatment. However, it is challenging to predict how developments will unfold given the unprecedented nature of this pandemic. A short-term breakdown in supply chains, interrupted trade, or social distancing mandates may not have much of an effect on the availability of synthetic drugs. Yet, disruptions in trade for months or years could shape how drugs are supplied or used. Drug policy will need to evaluate market indicators as soon as they are available but responding now with expanded medication therapies, like methadone, may help save lives. The drug policy landscape could look different in a post-COVID world.","Pardo, Bryce",Int J Drug Policy,,597

However, interactions between their biogeochemical fates remain poorly characterized, with absence of efficient route to decontamination of this combined pollution. In this work, microbial-driven Pyr degradation coupled to V(V) reduction was demonstrated for the first time. Removal efficiencies of Pyr and V(V) reached 94.8 ± 1.55% and 51.2 ± 0.20% in 72 h operation. The supplementation of co-substrate (glucose) deteriorated Pyr degradation slightly, but significantly promoted V(V) reduction efficiency to 84.5 ± 0.635%. Pyr was mineralized with NH4+-N accumulation, while insoluble vanadium (IV) was the major product from V(V) bio-reduction. It was observed that Bacillus and Pseudomonas realized synchronous Pyr and V(V) removals independently. Interspecific synergy between Pyr degraders and V(V) reducers also functioned with addition of co-substrate. V(V) was bio-reduced through alternative electron acceptor pathway conducted by gene nirS encoded nitrite reductase, which was evidenced by gene abundance and enzyme activity. Cytochrome c, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and extracellular polymeric substances also contributed to the coupled bioprocess. This work provides new insights into biogeochemical activities of Pyr and V(V), and proposes novel strategy for remediation of their co-contaminated aquifer.","Shi, Jiaxin; Li, Zongyan; Zhang, Baogang; Li, Lei; Sun, Weimin",J Hazard Mater,,597

We aimed to analyse the doubts, concerns and fears expressed by the Portuguese population about COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a content analysis of 293 questions submitted to online, radio, newspaper and TV channel forums during the first month of the pandemic in Portugal. RESULTS: Most questions contained doubts (n = 230), especially on how to prevent person-to-person transmission (n = 40) and how to proceed in case of symptoms (n = 37). Concerns and fears were also very commonly expressed (n = 144), mostly about which persons could be considered vulnerable (n = 53) and how to prevent transmission during daily life or normal activities (n = 37). CONCLUSION: As the pandemic evolved and suppression measures were put in place, doubts moved to concerns of vulnerability, quarantine and social isolation, and to doubts about transmission, transmission prevention, and on how to proceed in case of symptoms.

Before the Jewish New Year (two-day gathering) SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity rates were 17.6% and reached 28.1% two weeks later Taffix - an innovative nasal powder creates a protective gel over the nasal mucosa blocking viruses from infecting nasal cells, was tested for efficacy in preventing SARS CoV2 infection.Methods: In a prospective users survey, 243 members of an ultra-orthodox community that participated in two days prayers were followed for 14 days following this 'superspread' event. Eighty-three used Taffix throughout holiday's prayers and the following two weeks (ITT). Eighty-one used it regularly (PP). Two used it rarely if at all. The remaining 160 did not use Taffix.Results: After 14 days, 0/81 (0%) of (PP) Tafffix users, 2/83 (2.4%) of (ITT) Taffix users and 16/160 (10%) nonusers were infected. Odds ratio for infection among Taffix users was 0.22, a reduction of 78% (95%CI 1%-95%). No side effects reported.Conclusion: Taffix could be an additional tool against COVID19 spread, in addition to recommended safety measures. This is the first time that a prevention measure of SARS-CoV-2, beyond the use of masks, has proved effective.","Shmuel, Klang; Dalia, Megiddo; Tair, Lapidot; Yaakov, Naparstek",Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther,,597

In May 2020, all SECT members were invited to complete an online, 40-item, multiple choice questionnaire. The questionnaire was developed by the SECT Scientific Committee and sent via email. The overall response rate was 19.2%. The respondents answered at least 91.5% of the items, with only one exception (a question about residents). Most respondents (89.3%) worked in public hospitals. The reported impact of the pandemic on routine clinical activity was considered extreme or severe by 75.5% of respondents (25.5% and 50%, respectively). Multidisciplinary tumour boards were held either with fewer members attending or through electronic platforms (44.6% and 35.9%, respectively). Surgical activity decreased by 95.7%, with 41.5% of centers performing surgery only on oncological patients and 11.7% only in emergencies. Nearly 60% of respondents reported modifying standard protocols for early-stage cancer and in the preoperative workup. Most centers (≈80%) reported using full personal protective equipment when operating on COVID-19 positive patients. The COVID-19 pandemic severely affected thoracic oncology surgery in Spain. The lack of common protocols led to a variable care delivery to lung cancer patients.","Martínez-Hernández, Néstor J.; Caballero Silva, Usue Cabañero Sánchez Alberto Campo-Cañaveral de la Cruz José Luis Obeso Carillo Andrés Jarabo Sarceda José Ramón Sevilla López Sebastián Cilleruelo Ramos Ángel Recuero Díaz José Luis Call Sergi Couñago Felipe Hernando Trancho Florentino Society on behalf of the Scientific Committee of the Spanish Thoracic Surgery",Cancers,,597

Here we use econometric time series analysis, inventory-driven price formation, dynamic material flow analysis, and life cycle assessment to model each copper supply chain actor's response to China's solid waste import ban and the COVID-19 pandemic. We demonstrate that the economic changes associated with China's solid waste import ban increase primary refining within China, offsetting the environmental benefits of decreased copper scrap refining and generating a cumulative increase in CO2-equivalent emissions of up to 13 Mt by 2040. Increasing China's refined copper imports reverses this trend, decreasing CO2e emissions in China (up to 180 Mt by 2040) and globally (up to 20 Mt). We test sensitivity to supply chain disruptions using GDP, mining, and refining shocks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, showing the results translate onto disruption effects.","Ryter, John; Fu, Xinkai; Bhuwalka, Karan; Roth, Richard; Olivetti, Elsa A",Nat Commun,,597

Methods: Using convenience sampling respondents were asked to complete a web-administered survey to explore impact of social distancing on loneliness, stress, and behavioral changes. The analytic sample consisted of 833 responses of persons aged 60 and older. Results: A large portion reported being stressed (36%), and/or being lonely (42.5%). Nearly 1/3 stated that their sense of loneliness increased during the time of social distancing. Respondents reported engaging in more solitary activity (and fewer in-person activities), using email and text messages more than usual, and spending more time on computers/tablet than usual. Approximately 2/3 reported using more social media than usual. These differed significantly by younger (age 60-70) and older (71+) respondents. Additionally, changes in physical activity, drinking, recreational drug use and sleeping pattern changes differed by age. Conclusions: Social distancing has significant consequences on loneliness and health behaviors among adults in the United States, many of which differ by age group. Results have implications for continued shelter in place practices, but also for any older adult that may be homebound for other reasons.","Emerson, Kerstin Gerst",Rev Panam Salud Publica,,597

Yet millions of Americans, especially those at highest risk of caries, do not know what CWF is or its preventive benefits. State health departments are responsible for educating their respective populations. Thus, this study assessed health department websites (N = 50) to determine if CWF content existed, the ease of finding it, and if it was written in plain language and for a consumer audience. We used the web component of the HLE2: The Health Literacy Environment of Hospitals and Health Centers (HLE2) to assess how easy or difficult it was to the navigate a website and find information. Forty-one websites had CWF information; 37 states had content written for a consumer audience. HLE2 scores ranged from 0 to 54 points (60 possible). Only five states had websites with a HLE2 score of 50 or higher. SHDs with higher HLE2 scores were easy to navigate and their content was written for a consumer audience. Study findings suggest most SHDs should improve their website's CWF content and its accessibility to better promote the role of fluoridated water in preventing dental caries.","Maybury, Catherine; Jacob, Matt; Flanders, Jessica M; Horowitz, Alice M",PLoS One,,597

Methods : The active compounds of Shengmai Injection were screened by TCMSP and BATMAN-TCM database. The action target was predicted by TCMSP and Targetnet online database, and the active component-action target network diagram was constructed by Cytoscape 3.7.1; Taking ""coronavirus pneumonia"" as the keyword, coronavirus-related disease targets were searched in GeneCards database and OMIM database. The common target was selected by intersection with the target of Shengmai Injection as the research target. The common target was imported into STRING database to obtain data, and then the protein-protein interaction network map was constructed in Cytoscape 3.7.1 software; The enrichment analysis of GO function and KEGG pathway was carried out by using R language to predict its action mechanism and construct the ""component-target-pathway"" network diagram; Molecular docking analysis of key targets was carried out by DiscoveryStudio 2.5 software. Results: A total of 22 active compounds were obtained from Shengmai Injection. They were DNOP, β-sitosterol, angeloylgomisin O, gomisin A, gomisin R, wuweizisu C, interiotherin B, changnanic acid, kadsulactone, kadsulignan B, neokadsuranic acid A, neokadsuranic acid B, neokadsuranic acid C, neokadsuranin, schisanlactone A, schisanlactone E, schizandronic acid, uridine, diosgenin, guanosine, N-trans-feruloyltyramine and stigmasterol. There were 224 corresponding targets and 16 common targets with COVID-19, namely CASP3, CASP8, PTGS2, BCL2, BAX, PRKCA, PTGS1, PIK3CG, F10, NOS3, DPP4, NOS2, TLR9, ACE, ICAM1 and PRKCE. The key targets were CASP3, PTGS2, NOS2, NOS3 and ICAM1. GO functional enrichment analysis showed that there were 771 entries for biological processes, 11 entries for cell composition and 79 items for molecular function. A total of 67 signal pathways were screened by KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, which were mainly related to AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications, apoptosis-multiple species, p53 signaling pathway, small cell lung cancer, and so on. The results of molecular docking showed that the components with better docking with the key targets were schisanlactone E, stigmasterol and N-trans-feruloyltyramine. Conclusion: The active compounds in Shengmai Injection, such as schisanlactone E, stigmasterol, N-trans-feruloyltyramine, can act on CASP3, PTGS2, NOS2, NOS3 and other targets to regulate multiple signaling pathways for anti-inflammatory, immune regulation, anti-shock and increasing blood oxygen saturation. This may play a role in the treatment of COVID-19.","Wang, Liang-Feng; Li, Hui-Ting; Wang, Yao; Liu, Xiao-Li; Chen, Qing-Yao; Xu, Jie; Yang, Ming; Zhang, Xiao-Fei; Wang, Fang",Chin. Trad.

490781,Geriatric Antibody Response to COVID-19,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Emotion dysregulation problems are prevalent and disruptive for many with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This study compared severity and perceived change in emotion dysregulation in youth with and without ASD and probed correlates of emotion dysregulation (including possible two-way interactions) among youth with ASD. METHOD: Participants were drawn from two large online samples (mean age = 12; range: 6-17) with (N = 1323) and without (N = 921) ASD. The study used the Emotion Dysregulation Inventory (EDI), a parent-report measure designed for youth with ASD. The EDI asks parents about current severity and perceived change (i.e. how current severity compares to lifetime severity) in emotion dysregulation, and includes two factors: Reactivity (rapidly escalating, intense negative affect) and Dysphoria (poorly upregulated positive affect, general unease). RESULTS: Results indicated that youth with ASD had greater Reactivity severity and also greater positive change in Reactivity than non-ASD peers. Furthermore, differences between youth with and without ASD in the relationship between Reactivity and Dysphoria suggest a distinct profile of emotion dysregulation in ASD. Within the ASD sample, age and severity of stereotyped behavior predicted Reactivity and Dysphoria severity and Reactivity change. Female gender, lower parent education, and fluent verbal ability were additional predictors of increased Reactivity severity, while intellectual disability predicted lower Dysphoria severity. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides new insight into predictors of emotion dysregulation in youth with ASD and represents a first step toward identifying which children with ASD may be most vulnerable to severe emotion dysregulation problems.","Northrup, Jessie B; Patterson, Mark T; Mazefsky, Carla A",J Clin Child Adolesc Psychol,,597

METHODS: A cross-sectional study conducted between May 18 and June 26, 2020, during which HCWs at a large inner-city teaching hospital in NYC received voluntary antibody testing. The main outcome was presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies indicating previous infection. Seroprevalence and adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for seropositivity by type and location of work were calculated using logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Of 2,749 HCWs tested, 831 tested positive, yielding a crude seroprevalence of 30.2% (95% CI, 29%-32%). Seroprevalence ranged from 11.1% for pharmacy staff to 44.0% for nonclinical HCWs comprised of patient transporters and housekeeping and security staff, with 37.5% for nurses and 20.9% for administrative staff. Compared to administrative staff, aORs (95% CIs) for seropositivity were 2.54 (1.64-3.94) for nurses; 2.51 (1.42-4.43) for nonclinical HCWs; between 1.70 and 1.83 for allied HCWs such as patient care technicians, social workers, registration clerks and therapists; and 0.80 (0.50-1.29) for physicians. Compared to office locations, aORs for the emergency department and inpatient units were 2.27 (1.53-3.37) and 1.48 (1.14-1.92), respectively. CONCLUSION: One-third of hospital-based HCWs were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 by the end of the first wave in NYC. Seroprevalence differed by job function and work location, with the highest estimated risk for nurses and the emergency department, respectively. These findings support current nationwide policy prioritizing HCWs for receipt of newly authorized COVID-19 vaccines.","Purswani, Murli U; Bucciarelli, Jessica; Tiburcio, Jose; Yagudayev, Shamuel M; Connell, Georgia H; Omidiran, Arafat A; Hannaway, Launcelot; Zeana, Cosmina; Healy, Maureen; Yu, Gary; Reich, Doug",J Hosp Med,,597

DESIGN: Observational cohort study. SETTING: A total of 258 adult critical care units. PATIENTS: A total of 10,362 patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 with a start of critical care between March 1, 2020, and June 22, 2020, of whom 9,990 were eligible (excluding patients with a duration of critical care less than 24 hr or missing core variables). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The main outcome measure was time to death within 30 days of the start of critical care. Of 9,990 eligible patients (median age 60 yr, 70% male), 6,027 died within 30 days of the start of critical care. As of July 22, 2020, 189 patients were still receiving critical care and a further 446 were still in acute hospital. Data were missing for between 0.1% and 7.2% of patients across prognostic factors. We imputed missing data ten-fold, using fully conditional specification and continuous variables were modeled using restricted cubic splines. Associations between the candidate prognostic factors and time to death within 30 days of the start of critical care were determined after adjustment for multiple variables with Cox proportional hazards modeling. Significant associations were identified for age, ethnicity, deprivation, body mass index, prior dependency, immunocompromise, lowest systolic blood pressure, highest heart rate, highest respiratory rate, PaO2/FIO2 ratio (and interaction with mechanical ventilation), highest blood lactate concentration, highest serum urea, and lowest platelet count over the first 24 hours of critical care. Nonsignificant associations were found for sex, sedation, highest temperature, and lowest hemoglobin concentration. CONCLUSIONS: We identified patient characteristics that predict an increased likelihood of death within 30 days of the start of critical care for patients with coronavirus disease 2019. These findings may support development of a prediction model for benchmarking critical care providers.","Ferrando-Vivas, Paloma; Doidge, James; Thomas, Karen; Gould, Doug W; Mouncey, Paul; Shankar-Hari, Manu; Young, J Duncan; Rowan, Kathryn M; Harrison, David A",Crit. care med,,597

In this context, Oncology Departments of the affected countries had to adapt quickly their health system care and establish new organizations and priorities. Thus, numerous recommendations and therapeutic options have been reported to optimize therapy delivery to patients with chronic disease and cancer. Obviously, while these cancer care recommendations are immediately applicable in Europe, they may not be applicable in certain emerging and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In this review, we aimed to summarize these international guidelines in accordance with cancer types, making a synthesis for daily practice to protect patients, staff and tailor anti-cancer therapy delivery taking into account patients/tumour criteria and tools availability.

For most, the pandemic required rapid transitioning to all virtual platforms. During this pandemic, the most vulnerable populations are at highest risk of falling through the cracks of engagement in clinical care and research. Nonetheless, we argue that we should reframe the discussion to consider how this transition may create opportunities to engage extensively to reach populations. Here, we present our experience in Atlanta (Georgia, United States) in transitioning a group visit model for South Asian immigrants to a virtual platform and the pivotal role community members in the form of community health workers can play in building capacity among participants. We provide details on how this model helped address common barriers to group visit models in clinical practice and how our community health worker team innovatively addressed the digital challenges of working with an elderly population with limited English proficiency.","Shah, Megha K; Gibbs, Ashley Christina; Ali, Mohammed K; Narayan, K M Venkat; Islam, Nadia",J Med Internet Res,,597
492217,"COVID-19 and TURKMI, miRNAs in CAD, effects of cannabis and tramadol use, and more",2020,"In the face of the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, billions of people were forced to stay at home due to the implementation of social distancing and lockdown policies. As a result, individuals lost their social relationships, leading to social isolation and loneliness. Both social isolation and loneliness are major risk factors for poor physical and mental health status through enhanced chronic inflammation; however, there might be an interplay between social isolation and loneliness on the association with chronic inflammation. We aimed to clarify the link between social relationships and inflammation in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic by distinguishing whether social isolation only, loneliness only, or both were associated with chronic inflammation markers among community-dwelling adults. The data of 624 people (aged 18-92 years, mean 51.4) from the Utsunomiya COVID-19 seROprevalence Neighborhood Association (U-CORONA) study, which targeted randomly sampled households in Utsunomiya city, Japan, were analyzed. Social isolation was assessed as a structural social network by asking the number of social roles they have on a daily basis. Loneliness was measured with the UCLA loneliness scale. As chronic inflammation biomarkers, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and the concentration of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured. Generalized estimating equations method was employed to take into account the correlations within households. Isolated-Lonely condition (i.e., being both socially isolated and feeling lonely) was associated with higher NLR among men (B = 0.141, 95%CI = -0.01 to 0.29). Interestingly, Nonisolated-Lonely condition (i.e., not socially isolated but feeling lonely) was associated with lower CRP among women (B = -0.462, 95%CI = -0.82 to -0.10) and among the working-age population (B = -0.495, 95%CI = -0.76 to -0.23). In conclusion, being both socially isolated and feeling lonely was associated with chronic inflammation. Assessing both social isolation and loneliness is critical for proper interventions to mitigate the impact of poor social relationships on health, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Koyama, Yuna; Nawa, Nobutoshi; Yamaoka, Yui; Nishimura, Hisaaki; Sonoda, Shiro; Kuramochi, Jin; Miyazaki, Yasunari; Fujiwara, Takeo",Brain Behav Immun,,597

In doing so, they acquire new risks of security vulnerabilities and privacy violations. To help universities navigate this landscape, we develop a model that describes the actors, incentives, and risks, informed by surveying 49 educators and 14 administrators at U.S. universities. Next, we develop a methodology for administrators to assess security and privacy risks of these products. We then conduct a privacy and security analysis of 23 popular platforms using a combination of sociological analyses of privacy policies and 129 state laws, alongside a technical assessment of platform software. Based on our findings, we develop recommendations for universities to mitigate the risks to their stakeholders.","Cohney, Shaanan; Teixeira, Ross; Kohlbrenner, Anne; Narayanan, Arvind; Kshirsagar, Mihir; Shvartzshnaider, Yan; Sanfilippo, Madelyn",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.05867v3.pdf,597

Vaccine development is focused on the principal target of the humoral immune response, the spike (S) glycoprotein, which mediates cell entry and membrane fusion. The SARS-CoV-2 S gene encodes 22 N-linked glycan sequons per protomer, which likely play a role in protein folding and immune evasion. Here, using a site-specific mass spectrometric approach, we reveal the glycan structures on a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S immunogen. This analysis enables mapping of the glycan-processing states across the trimeric viral spike. We show how SARS-CoV-2 S glycans differ from typical host glycan processing, which may have implications in viral pathobiology and vaccine design.","Watanabe, Yasunori; Allen, Joel D; Wrapp, Daniel; McLellan, Jason S; Crispin, Max",Science,,597

There are currently more than three million diagnosed cases, constituting a pandemic which has caused a worldwide crisis. The devastating effects of this infection are due to its highly contagious nature and although mild forms predominate, in absolute values, the rates for severe forms and mortality are very high. The information on the characteristics of the infection in inflammatory bowel disease is of special interest, as these patients have higher attendance at health centres, which may increase their risk of infection. Furthermore, the treatments used to control the inflammatory activity may modify the disease course of COVID-19.

METHODS: Descriptive analyses were conducted to examine relationships among measures of influenza immunization, transmission of transition records, and attainment of follow-up care with data from 1,602 IPFs in 2018 and the COVID-19 Community Vulnerability Index. RESULTS: One-quarter of IPFs were in counties with high or very high COVID-19 vulnerability. On average, 84% of patients at IPFs were screened for influenza immunization status and were offered an immunization if indicated. Only 57% of patients had their records transmitted to another provider within 24 hours of discharge, and 50% had a follow-up visit with a mental health provider within 30 days. Scores on attainment of follow-up care were worse in counties with higher COVID-19 vulnerability. CONCLUSIONS: IPFs may be well positioned to offer COVID-19 vaccinations but will need new processes and improved rates of follow-up care to ensure that patients receive the second dose.","Brown, Jonathan D; Bell, Nadia",Psychiatr Serv,,597

It was our hypothesis that the associated implementation of physical distancing and masking led to a decline in circulation and detection of common respiratory viruses. Nasopharyngeal swabs processed with the Biofire, Film Array respiratory panel at Mayo Clinic Arizona were reviewed from January 1, 2017, to July 31, 2020. A total of 13,324 nasopharyngeal swabs were analyzed. Between April and July 2017- 2019 (Period A) a mean of 262 tests were performed monthly, falling to 128 for the corresponding months of 2020 (Period B). A reduction in the monthly mean number of positive tests (Period A 71.5; Period B 2.8) and mean positivity rate (Period A 25.04%; Period B 2.07%) was observed. Rhinovirus/enterovirus was the most prevalent virus, with a monthly mean of 21.6 cases (30.2% of positives) for Period A and 2 cases (72.7% of positives) for Period B. Positivity for a second virus occurred in a mean of 2.1 positive tests (3.3%) in Period A but was absent in Period B. Implementation of distancing and masking coincides with a marked reduction in respiratory virus detection and likely circulation. Data from the fall/winter of 2020 will help clarify the potential role for distancing and masking as a mitigation strategy, not only for SARS-CoV-2 but also in the seasonal battle against common respiratory viruses.","Freeman, Catherine M; Rank, Matthew A; Bolster LaSalle, Catherine M; Grys, Thomas E; Lewis, John C",Mayo Clin Proc,,597

As patients with cancer exhibit a higher level of inflammation compared with the general patient population, patients with cancer and COVID-19 may uniquely benefit from strategies targeted at overcoming the unrestrained pro-inflammatory response. Targeted and non-targeted anti-inflammatory therapies may prevent end-organ damage in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with cancer and decrease mortality. Here, we review the clinical role of selective inhibition of pro-inflammatory interleukins, tyrosine kinase modulation, anti-tumor necrosis factor agents, and other non-targeted approaches including corticosteroids in their roles as disease-modulating agents in patients with COVID-19 and cancer. Investigation of these therapeutics in this highly vulnerable patient group is posited to facilitate the development of tailored therapeutics for this patient population, aiding the transition of systemic inflammation from a prognostic domain to a source of therapeutic targets.","Dettorre, G M; Patel, M; Gennari, A; Pentheroudakis, G; Romano, E; Cortellini, A; Pinato, D J",ESMO Open,,597
494153,Global Pediatric Pulmonology Alliance recommendation to strengthen prevention of pediatric seasonal influenza under COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Diabetes and osteoporosis are common chronic disorders with growing prevalence in the aging population. Skeletal fragility secondary to diabetes increases the risk of fractures and is underestimated by currently available diagnostic tools like fracture risk assessment (FRAX) and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). In this narrative review we describe the relationship and pathophysiology of skeletal fragility and fractures in Type 2 diabetes (T2DM), effect of glucose lowering medications on bone metabolism and the approach to diagnosing and managing osteoporosis and bone fragility in people with diabetes (PWD). METHODS: A literature search was conducted on PubMed for articles in English that focused on T2DM and osteoporosis or bone/skeletal fragility. Articles considered to be of direct clinical relevance to physicians practicing diabetes were included. RESULTS: T2DM is associated with skeletal fragility secondary to compromised bone remodeling and bone turnover. Long duration, poor glycemic control, presence of chronic complications, impaired muscle function, and anti-diabetic medications like thiazolidinediones (TZD) are risk factors for fractures among PWD. Conventional diagnostic tools like DXA and FRAX tool underestimate fracture risk in diabetes. Presence of diabetes does not alter response to anti-osteoporotic treatment in post-menopausal women. CONCLUSION: Estimation of fragility fracture risk should be included in standard of care for T2DM along with screening for traditional complications. Physicians should proactively screen for and manage osteoporosis in people with diabetes. It is important to consider effects on bone health when selecting glucose lowering agents in people at risk for fragility fractures.","Farooqui, Khalid J; Mithal, Ambrish; Kerwen, Ann Kwee; Chandran, Manju",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,597

This study was conducted retrospectively to investigate the detailed sinonasal manifestations and dynamic profile of real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in COVID-19 patients longitudinally. METHODS: This retrospective study included 11 consecutive patients. The prevalence, timing and severity of sinonasal manifestations were analyzed. Oropharyngeal, nasal, sputum and stool specimens were collected to detect RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 over COVID-19 period. RESULTS: Among the 11 patients, 6 (54.5%) were female, and the median age was 51 (IQR, 36-62) years. Seven patients (63.6%) experienced sinonasal symptoms, with 6 (54.5%) exhibiting sinonasal symptoms on the onset day. Seven patients (63.6%) demonstrated nasal obstruction, 5 (45.5%) had rhinorrhea, and 4 (36.4%) exhibited olfactory dysfunction. All six patients with sinonasal symptoms on the onset day had non-severe infections. Most patients (85.7%) with sinonasal symptoms had non-severe infections. Sinonasal symptoms commonly appeared early. The positive RT-PCR rate for SARS-CoV-2 in various specimens was highest in the first week (73.3%), then gradually decreased over the disease course, but 3 patients (27.3%) had experienced a long-lasting fluctuated positive RT-PCR results since 29 days of illness in both groups, especially for two patients with airway comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: Sinonasal symptoms were more prevalent in patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 and usually appeared early. In addition, regular nucleic acid testing for SARS-CoV-2 should be considered for COVID-19 patients with certain airway comorbidities.","Jia, Xiaoqing; Shao, Shan; Ren, Hong; Xu, Yuan; Zhao, Jinming; Zhao, Yan; Wang, Yue; Bao, Shiping; Yan, Junping; Wang, Xiangdong; Zhang, Luo",Ann Palliat Med,,597

The nsp16 catalytic subunit of the 2'-O-MTase is unusual in its requirement for a stimulatory subunit (nsp10) to catalyze the ribose 2'-O-methylation of the viral RNA cap. Here we provide a computational basis for drug repositioning or de novo drug development based on three differential traits of the intermolecular interactions of the SARS-CoV-2-specific nsp16/nsp10 heterodimer, namely: (1) the S-adenosyl-l-methionine-binding pocket of nsp16, (2) the unique ""activating surface"" between nsp16 and nsp10, and (3) the RNA-binding groove of nsp16. We employed &#8776;9000 U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved investigational and experimental drugs from the DrugBank repository for docking virtual screening. After molecular dynamics calculations of the stability of the binding modes of high-scoring nsp16/nsp10-drug complexes, we considered their pharmacological overlapping with functional modules of the virus-host interactome that is relevant to the viral lifecycle, and to the clinical features of COVID-19. Some of the predicted drugs (e.g., tegobuvir, sonidegib, siramesine, antrafenine, bemcentinib, itacitinib, or phthalocyanine) might be suitable for repurposing to pharmacologically reactivate innate immune restriction and antagonism of SARS-CoV-2 RNAs lacking 2'-O-methylation.","Encinar, José Antonio; Menendez, Javier A",Viruses,,597

This study estimated the frequencies of predicted pathogenic COL4A3-COL4A5 variants in sequencing databases of populations without known kidney disease. METHODS: Predicted pathogenic variants were identified using filtering steps based on the ACMG/AMP criteria, which considered collagen IV &#945;3-&#945;5 position 1 Gly to be critical domains. The population frequencies of predicted pathogenic COL4A3-COL4A5 variants were then determined per mean number of sequenced alleles. Population frequencies for compound heterozygous and digenic combinations were calculated from the results for heterozygous variants. RESULTS: COL4A3-COL4A5 variants resulting in position 1 Gly substitutions were confirmed to be associated with hematuria (for each, P<0.001). Predicted pathogenic COL4A5 variants were found in at least one in 2320 individuals. p.(Gly624Asp) represented nearly half (16 of 33, 48%) of the variants in Europeans. Most COL4A5 variants (54 of 59, 92%) had a biochemical feature that potentially mitigated the clinical effect. The predicted pathogenic heterozygous COL4A3 and COL4A4 variants affected one in 106 of the population, consistent with the finding of thin basement membrane nephropathy in normal donor kidney biopsy specimens. Predicted pathogenic compound heterozygous variants occurred in one in 88,866 individuals, and digenic variants in at least one in 44,793. CONCLUSIONS: The population frequencies for Alport syndrome are suggested by the frequencies of predicted pathogenic COL4A3-COL4A5 variants, but must be adjusted for the disease penetrance of individual variants and for the likelihood of already diagnosed disease and non-Gly substitutions. Disease penetrance may depend on other genetic and environmental factors.","Gibson, Joel; Fieldhouse, Rachel; Chan, Melanie M Y; Sadeghi-Alavijeh, Omid; Burnett, Leslie; Izzi, Valerio; Persikov, Anton V; Gale, Daniel P; Storey, Helen; Savige, Judy",J.

RESULTS: The financial recession of 2008 caused a 4-year plateau in fertility treatments with a predicted 53,026 (95% confidence interval [CI] 49,581 to 56,471) fewer IVF cycles and 16,872 (95% CI 16,713 to 17,031) fewer live births. A similar scale of economic recession would cause 67,386 (95% CI 61,686 to 73,086) fewer IVF cycles between 2020 and 2023, with women younger than 35 years overall undertaking 22,504 (95% CI 14,320 to 30,690) fewer cycles, compared with 4445 (95% CI 3144 to 5749) fewer cycles in women over the age of 40 years. This equates to overall 25,143 (95% CI 22,408 to 27,877) fewer predicted live births from IVF, of which only 490 (95% CI 381 to 601) are anticipated to occur in women over the age of 40 years. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 recession could have a profound impact on US IVF live birth rates in young women, further aggravating pre-existing declines in total fertility rates.","Gromski, Piotr S; Smith, Andrew D A C; Lawlor, Deborah A; Sharara, Fady I; Nelson, Scott M",Reprod. biomed. online,,597
498978,Risk Assessment of Surgical Interventions Performed on Non-Infected Patients During COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread across the globe and significantly impacts health-care systems and strains resources, identifying prognostic factors to predict clinical outcome remains essential. We conducted a retrospective cohort study to further explore the prognostic value of serum hypoalbuminemia and other factors in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The primary endpoint was defined as the risk of in-hospital mortality. 300 patients were included in the analysis, with 56% being male and a mean (±SD) age of 61.5 ± 15.3 years. The mean (±SD) albumin was 2.86 ± 0.5 g/dL. Our analysis showed that patients with in-hospital mortality had lower albumin levels than patients without in-hospital mortality (2.6 ± 0.49 vs. 2.9 ± 0.48 g/dL, respectively, with P value = &lt;0.001). A multivariant logistic regression analysis was subsequently conducted, and after adjustment, the serum albumin level remained a strong predictor of the primary outcome. Based on the data gathered, we were able to create a model predictive of mortality in this patient group based on the serum albumin level and other pertinent factors. In this model, with all other variables remaining constant, each one-unit increase in albumin is estimated to reduce the odds of mortality by 73%. Our results strengthen the current available data on the prognostic value of serum albumin in COVID-19 patients and provide a model to predict in-hospital mortality.

This has led to an increase in internet usage including social media. This study was carried out in order to discover how the pandemic affected the Maltese population who use social media networks daily. METHODS: A dataset comprising more than 50,000 comments and in excess of 150,000 interactions were extracted from Facebook over four months. The method was quantitative and qualitative. Pearson correlation was used to analyse trends. RESULTS: Online interaction increased 200% between February-April 2020, with a significant positive correlation. There was also a significant correlation between online interaction and engagement and the Covid-19 situation in Malta (p âª 0.0001). Online posts portraying a sense of care, affection, and unity increased by more than 300% over the same period, and this also significantly correlated with the number of COVID-19 cases in Malta (p âª 0.0001). An increase in the number of COVID-19 cases had an emotional impact mainly on anxiety and agitation. DISCUSSION: The pandemic has unleashed a veritable 'infodemic' (an over-abundance of information - some accurate and some not). Social media engagement may have been resorted to not only to seek information but also to interact with friends and family who were not physically accessible due to social distancing measures. Yet another reason could have been to seek comfort and reassurance by interacting with those closest to us. Social media is not only an everyday tool but also a haven of last resort when physical connection is not possible.","Agius, Steve; Grech, Anton; Grech, Victor",Early Hum Dev,,597
499923,Keeping our eyecare providers and patients safe during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Autopsies on COVID-19 have provided deep insights into a novel disease with unpredictable and potentially fatal outcome. A standardized autopsy procedure preferably with an in-situ technique and systematic tissue processing is important. Strict safety measures include personal protective equipment with a standardized protocol for dressing and undressing, usage of FFP-3 masks and minimization of aerosol production. The use of an airborne infection isolation (AIIR) room is preferred. Viral RNA analysis using swabs from throat, both lungs and other organs provides information on cross-organ viral dynamics. To correctly determine the full extent of pathological organ changes an adequate processing procedure is of the utmost importance. Systematic dissection and processing of the lungs revealed pulmonary infarction caused by thrombosis and thromboembolism and bacterial bronchopneumonia as the most frequent cause of death. Fungal pneumonia (aspergillus) was found in one case. The quality of the tissue was sufficient for histopathological and immunohistochemistry analyses in all cases. Viral RNA from throat or lung swabs was detectable post mortem in 89 % of the cases and could also be detected from paraffin-embedded tissue by real-time PCR. Complete COVID-19 autopsies including extensive histopathological studies and viral RNA analysis require approximately three times more human and technical resources and time compared to standard non-COVID autopsies. Autopsies on COVID-19 are feasible, present a manageable risk, while following a strict protocol, and provide novel insights into disease pathogenesis and the clinician with important feedback.","Skok, Kristijan; Vander, Klaus; Setaffy, Lisa; Kessler, Harald H; Aberle, Stephan; Bargfrieder, Ute; Trauner, Michael; Lax, Sigurd F",Pathol Res Pract,,597

501217,CMA urges national action to curb third wave of COVID-19,2021,"Background: The current COVID-19 pandemic provides an incentive to expand considerably the use of telemedicine for high-risk patients with diabetes, and especially for the management of type 1 diabetes (T1D). Telemedicine and digital medicine also offer critically important approaches to improve access, efficacy, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of medical care for people with diabetes. Methods: Two case reports are presented where telemedicine was used effectively and safely after day 1 in person patient education. These aspects of the management of new-onset T1D patients (adult and pediatric) included ongoing diabetes education of the patient and family digitally. The patients used continuous glucose monitoring with commercially available analysis software (Dexcom Clarity and Glooko) to generate ambulatory glucose profiles and interpretive summary reports. The adult subject used multiple daily insulin injections; the pediatric patient used an insulin pump. The subjects were managed using a combination of e-mail, Internet via Zoom, and telephone calls. Results: These two cases show the feasibility and effectiveness of use of telemedicine in applications in which we had not used it previously: new-onset diabetes education and insulin dosage management. Conclusions: The present case reports illustrate how telemedicine can be used safely and effectively for new-onset T1D training and education for both pediatric and adult patients and their families. The COVID-19 pandemic has acutely stimulated the expansion of the use of telemedicine and digital medicine. We conclude that telemedicine is an effective approach for the management of patients with new-onset T1D.","Garg, Satish K; Rodbard, David; Hirsch, Irl B; Forlenza, Gregory P",Diabetes Technol Ther,,597

505424,A pitfall in estimating the e ective reproductive number Rt for COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Ferroptosis, nonapoptotic cell death mediated by free radical reactions and driven by the oxidative degradation of lipids, is a therapeutic target because of its role in organ damage, including AKI. Ferroptosis-causing radicals that are targeted by ferroptosis suppressors have not been unequivocally identified. Because certain cytochrome P450 substrate drugs can prevent lipid peroxidation via obscure mechanisms, we evaluated their antiferroptotic potential and used them to identify ferroptosis-causing radicals. METHODS: Using a cell-based assay, we screened cytochrome P450 substrate compounds to identify drugs with antiferroptotic activity and investigated the underlying mechanism. To evaluate radical-scavenging activity, we used electron paramagnetic resonance-spin trapping methods and a fluorescence probe for lipid radicals, NBD-Pen, that we had developed. We then assessed the therapeutic potency of these drugs in mouse models of cisplatin-induced AKI and LPS/galactosamine-induced liver injury. RESULTS: We identified various US Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs and hormones that have antiferroptotic properties, including rifampicin, promethazine, omeprazole, indole-3-carbinol, carvedilol, propranolol, estradiol, and thyroid hormones. The antiferroptotic drug effects were closely associated with the scavenging of lipid peroxyl radicals but not significantly related to interactions with other radicals. The elevated lipid peroxyl radical levels were associated with ferroptosis onset, and known ferroptosis suppressors, such as ferrostatin-1, also functioned as lipid peroxyl radical scavengers. The drugs exerted antiferroptotic activities in various cell types, including tubules, podocytes, and renal fibroblasts. Moreover, in mice, the drugs ameliorated AKI and liver injury, with suppression of tissue lipid peroxidation and decreased cell death. CONCLUSIONS: Although elevated lipid peroxyl radical levels can trigger ferroptosis onset, some drugs that scavenge lipid peroxyl radicals can help control ferroptosis-related disorders, including AKI.","Mishima, Eikan; Sato, Emiko; Ito, Junya; Yamada, Ken-Ichi; Suzuki, Chitose; Oikawa, Yoshitsugu; Matsuhashi, Tetsuro; Kikuchi, Koichi; Toyohara, Takafumi; Suzuki, Takehiro; Ito, Sadayoshi; Nakagawa, Kiyotaka; Abe, Takaaki",J Am Soc Nephrol,,597

Speech-based detection can be one of the safest tools for this purpose as the voice of the suspected can be easily recorded. The Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) analysis of speech signal is one of the oldest but potential analysis tools. The performance of this analysis mainly depends on the use of conversion between normal frequency scale to perceptual frequency scale and the frequency range of the filters used. Traditionally, in speech recognition, these values are fixed. But the characteristics of speech signals vary from disease to disease. In the case of detection of COVID-19, mainly the coughing sounds are used whose bandwidth and properties are quite different from the complete speech signal. By exploiting these properties the efficiency of the COVID-19 detection can be improved. To achieve this objective the frequency range and the conversion scale of frequencies have been suitably optimized. Further to enhance the accuracy of detection performance, speech enhancement has been carried out before extraction of features. By implementing these two concepts a new feature called COVID-19 Coefficient (C-19CC) is developed in this paper. Finally, the performance of these features has been compared.","Dash, Tusar Kanti Mishra Soumya Panda Ganapati Satapathy Suresh Chandra",Pattern Recognition,,597

508738,Special Issues on Using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment for telemedicine Assessment During COVID-19,2020,"The immune system has evolved multiple mechanisms to restrict microbial infections and regulate inflammatory responses. Without appropriate regulation, infection-induced inflammatory pathology can be deadly. The innate immune system recognizes the microbial molecules conserved in many pathogens and engages a rapid response by producing inflammatory mediators and activating programmed cell death pathways, including pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis. Activation of pattern recognition receptors, in combination with inflammatory cytokine-induced signaling through death domain-containing receptors, initiates a highly interconnected cell death process called PANoptosis (pyroptosis, apoptosis, necroptosis). Broadly speaking, PANoptosis is critical for restricting a wide range of pathogens (including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites), which we describe in this review. We propose that re-examining the role of cell death and inflammatory cytokines through the lens of PANoptosis will advance our understanding of host-pathogen evolution and may reveal new treatment strategies for controlling a wide range of infectious diseases.","Place, David E; Lee, SangJoon; Kanneganti, Thirumala-Devi",Curr Opin Microbiol,,597

The purpose of this study was to determine complications associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection for all operations done from March 16-June 30, 2020. Study Design: This study was a single-institution, retrospective observational analysis of data for all surgical procedures and all SARS-CoV-2 tests done in the medical center from March 16-June 30, 2020. The charts of all SARS-CoV-2-positive patients who had a surgical procedure during the study time period were retrospectively reviewed to assess the outcomes. Results: Of 2,208 operations during that time, 29 (1.3%) patients were SARS-CoV-2-positive and were asymptomatic at the time of their operations. Twenty-four (82.7%) of the 29 required urgent or emergent procedures. The median time between availability of test results and operations for these patients was 0.63 + 1.94 days. With median follow-up of 89 days, none of the 29 patients died from SARS-CoV-2-related causes, and none developed clinically evident thromboembolism or required re-intubation secondary to SARS-CoV-2-related pneumonia. Conclusion: By operating on carefully screened, asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, it was possible to eliminate major complications and mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Sargent, Rachel E; Sener, Stephen F; Amaya, Rodolfo; Vazquez, Elizabeth; Bowdish, Michael E; Spellberg, Brad",,,597
509078,What are the priorities of pathologists' activities during COVID-19 emergency?,2020,"PURPOSE: Decentralisation of decision-making from central to lower level organisation has been proposed as a way to increase innovation and make services more responsive to local needs. The purpose of this study was to discover research that can contribute to understanding decentralisation as one strategy for resolving challenges in healthcare service delivery organisations. This scoping review provides examples and research-informed guidance for decentralisation research, planning and implementation. FINDINGS: There is limited empirical research into management decentralisation within primary and community care, but some useful frameworks for assessing and planning decentralisation. Rapid changes are being made to workforce redesign, substitution and patient co-production. Research into such 'micro-decentralisation' is not considered in the decentralisation literature. Neither is how the context of culture, systems and regulations affects implementation of this type of decentralisation. Our recent experience suggests that management decentralisation can enable fast and effective local changes to respond to the evolving Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS COV-2) pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Decentralisation can create conditions that support innovation and improvement locally to develop primary and community care. Managers and policy makers can use an appropriate decentralisation strategy to address challenges in workforce retention and recruitment, rising care demands and expectations of patients. There are opportunities for researchers to provide actionable knowledge about changes in organisations and management which could address current challenges in healthcare.","Ohrling, Mikael; Øvretveit, John; Brommels, Mats",Int. j. health plann. manage,,597
509305,COVID-19 and the kidney: A South African state healthcare experience,2021,"Mathematical models are formal and simplified representations of the knowledge related to a phenomenon. In classical epidemic models, a neglected aspect is the heterogeneity of disease transmission and progression linked to the viral load of each infectious individual. Here, we attempt to investigate the interplay between the evolution of individuals' viral load and the epidemic dynamics from a theoretical point of view. In the framework of multi-agent systems, we propose a particle stochastic model describing the infection transmission through interactions among agents and the individual physiological course of the disease. Agents have a double microscopic state: a discrete label, that denotes the epidemiological compartment to which they belong and switches in consequence of a Markovian process, and a microscopic trait, representing a normalized measure of their viral load, that changes in consequence of binary interactions or interactions with a background. Specifically, we consider Susceptible--Infected--Removed--like dynamics where infectious individuals may be isolated from the general population and the isolation rate may depend on the viral load sensitivity and frequency of tests. We derive kinetic evolution equations for the distribution functions of the viral load of the individuals in each compartment, whence, via suitable upscaling procedures, we obtain a macroscopic model for the densities and viral load momentum. We perform then a qualitative analysis of the ensuing macroscopic model, and we present numerical tests in the case of both constant and viral load-dependent isolation control. Also, the matching between the aggregate trends obtained from the macroscopic descriptions and the original particle dynamics simulated by a Monte Carlo approach is investigated.","Marca, Rossella Della; Loy, Nadia; Tosin, Andrea",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.14480v1.pdf,597

METHODS: Observational study, based on a cross-sectional (10-20th September 2020) online survey, conducted in a cohort of pwMS' followed at two Portuguese hospitals. The survey included measures to characterize the sample and a questionnaire designed to assess the topics defined for this study. RESULTS: 270 respondents completed the full survey (response rate 58.2%). pwMS greatest concern during the pandemic was an aggravation of MS, especially by patients older than 50 years old. Almost 40% of the patients older than 50 felt that the pandemic negatively affected their MS related medical assistance. Most patients believed they would recover from COVID-19 infection. More than half of the responders feared a MS aggravation if they got COVID-19; this was more pronounced in patients with progressive MS. About 12% of the participants did not want to be vaccinated and almost 40% was unsure. Regarding vaccines in general, almost a third of the participants feared their side effects or MS related complications.

Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET) is a typical cognitive behavioral therapy targeting trauma-related psychological disorders and may be an effective intervention. METHODS: A total of 111 COVID-19 patients near the discharge stage with positive screening results for posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) were randomly assigned (1:1) to either the study group or the control group. The study group received NET and personalized psychological intervention, while the control group only received personalized psychological intervention. PTSS, depression, anxiety and sleep quality were measured pre- and post-intervention to evaluate the effect of NET. This trial was registered with the International Standard Randomized Clinical Trial Registry (No. ChiCTR2000039369). RESULTS: NET participants showed a significantly greater PTSS reduction in comparison with the control group after the intervention. Improvement in sleep quality, anxiety and depression after the intervention were pronounced but not significantly different between the two treatment groups. LIMITATIONS: The assessors weren't blinded for the convenience of measurement and protection of participants' psychological security. CONCLUSIONS: NET likely had a positive impact on PTSS of COVID-19 patients. Clinical staff should consider applying NET to improve the psychological well-being of patients who have experienced an epidemic such as COVID-19.","Fan, Ying; Shi, Yuxin; Zhang, Jun; Sun, Dingwen; Wang, Xuefei; Fu, Gaizhi; Mo, Daorong; Wen, Juan; Xiao, Xuexia; Kong, Lingai",J Affect Disord,,597

513523,Post COVID-19 Organizing Pneumonia: The Right Time to Interfere,2021,"BACKGROUND: Critical hypoxia in this COVID-19 pandemic results in high mortality and economic loss worldwide. Initially, this disease' pathophysiology was poorly understood and interpreted as a SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) pneumonia. The severe atypical lung CAT scan images alerted all countries, including the poorest, to purchase lacking sophisticated ventilators. However, 88% of the patients on ventilators lost their lives. It was suggested that COVID-19 could be similar to a High-Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE). New observations and pathological findings are gradually clarifying the disease. METHODS: As high-altitude medicine and hypoxia physiology specialists from the highlands, we perform a perspective analysis of hypoxic diseases treated at high altitude and compare them to Covid-19. Oxygen transport physiology, SARSCov-2 characteristics, and its transmission, lung imaging in COVID-19, and HAPE, as well as the causes of clinical signs and symptoms, are discussed. RESULTS: High-altitude oxygen transport physiology has been systematically ignored. COVID-19 signs and symptoms indicate a progressive and irreversible failure in the oxygen transport system, secondary to pneumolysis produced by SARS-Cov-2's alveolar-capillary membrane ""attack"". HAPE's pulmonary compromise is treatable and reversible. COVID-19 is associated with several diseases, with different individual outcomes, in different countries, and at different altitudes.","Zubieta-Calleja, Gustavo R; Zubieta-DeUrioste, Natalia; Venkatesh, Thuppil; Das, Kusal; Soliz, Jorge",Reviews on recent clinical trials (Online),,597

OBJECTIVES: To explore the coagulopathy and endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Study analyzed clinical and biological profiles of patients with suspected COVID-19 infection at admission, including hemostasis tests and quantification of circulating endothelial cells (CECs). RESULTS: Among 96 consecutive COVID-19-suspected patients fulfilling criteria for hospitalization, 66 were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 positive patients were more likely to present with fever (p=0.02), cough (p=0.03) and pneumonia at CT-scan (p=0.002) at admission. Prevalence of D-dimer >500 ng/mL was higher in COVID-19 positive patients (74.2% vs. 43.3%; p=0.007). No sign of disseminated intravascular coagulation were identified. Adding D-dimers >500 ng/mL to gender and pneumonia at CT scan in ROC curve analysis significantly increased AUC for COVID-19 diagnosis. COVID-19 positive patients had significantly more CECs at admission (p=0.008) than COVID-19 negative ones. COVID-19 positive patients treated with curative anticoagulant prior to admission had less CECs (p=0.02) than those without. Interestingly, patients treated with curative anticoagulation and ACEi or ARBs had even lesser CECs (p=0.007). CONCLUSION: Curative anticoagulation could prevent COVID-19-associated coagulopathy and endothelial lesion.","Khider, Lina; Gendron, Nicolas; Goudot, Guillaume; Chocron, Richard; Hauw-Berlemont, Caroline; Cheng, Charles; Rivet, Nadia; Pere, Helene; Roffe, Ariel; Clerc, Sébastien; Lebeaux, David; Debuc, Benjamin; Veyer, David; Rance, Bastien; Gaussem, Pascale; Bertil, Sébastien; Badoual, Cécile; Juvin, Philippe; Planquette, Benjamin; Messas, Emmanuel; Sanchez, Olivier; Hulot, Jean-Sébastien; Diehl, Jean-Luc; Mirault, Tristan; Smadja, David M",J. thromb. haemost,,597

BACKGROUND: Full gear personal protective equipment is the primary and foremost measure to prevent the contact and transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2); however, working in full gear personal protective equipment may hinder nursing care activities and thus negatively affect patients' and nurses' health. DESIGN: This descriptive qualitative inquiry followed the COREQ guidelines. METHODS: Individual semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted in a purposive sample of 15 frontline nurses who were dispatched to the outbreak epicentre from March to April 2020. Verbatim transcripts were content analysed. RESULTS: Four themes emerged from the data: inadequate preparedness for working with full gear personal protective equipment, full gear personal protective equipment stimulated stress responses, coping strategies and professional growth. Participants learned a great deal from problem-focussed and emotion-focussed strategies to tackle challenges related to the prolonged wearing of full gear personal protective equipment for quality nursing care and reduced risk of exposure. They became more vigilant to the adherence to evolving protocols and appropriate training concerning full gear personal protective equipment use. CONCLUSIONS: Frontline nurses confronted various but diminishing challenges related to the use of full gear personal protective equipment when caring for patients with COVID-19 across the approximate 40-day period. Consistent use of coverall personal protective equipment to protect from SARS-CoV-2 in high exposure settings would be feasible if nurses were better prepared; therefore, scenario-based skill training concerning the prolonged use of full gear personal protective equipment should be offered regularly and intensively. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study informs future decisions concerning improved full gear personal protective equipment-related psychomotor training and promoting ways for nurses to cope with the stress that comes from working in highly contiguous environments.","Chen, Feifei; Zang, Yuli; Liu, Yuan; Wang, Xiaomin; Lin, Xingfeng",J. clin. nurs,,597

516601,Upper respiratory tract and otolaryngological manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): A systemic review,2021,"BACKGROUND: Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is widely used in the outpatient setting for people with diabetes and has been limited to investigational use only for the inpatient population. In April 2020, the US FDA exercised enforcement discretion for the temporary use of inpatient CGM during the pandemic, thus hospitals were presented the opportunity to implement this technology. METHODS: We sought to investigate the accuracy of CGM in hospitalized patients on general care floors and the intensive care unit (ICU) in attempts to decrease healthcare professional exposure to COVID-19 and ultimately improve glycemic management of patients affected by COVID-19. Point of care (POC) and laboratory (Lab) glucose values were matched with simultaneous CGM glucose values and measures of accuracy were performed to evaluate the safety and usability of CGM in this population. Our data are presented drawing a distinction between POC and Lab as reference glucose sources. RESULTS: In 808 paired samples obtained from 28 patients (10 ICU, 18 general floor), overall mean absolute relative difference (MARD) for all patients using either POC or Lab as reference was 13.2%. When using POC as the reference glucose MARD was 13.9% and using Lab glucose as reference 10.9%. Using both POC and Lab reference glucose pairs the overall MARD for critical care patients was 12.1% and for general floor patients 14%. CONCLUSION: We determined, with proper protocols and safeguards in place, use of CGM in the hospitalized patient is a reasonable alternative to standard of care to achieve the goal of reducing healthcare professional exposure. Further study is necessary to validate safety, accuracy, and efficacy of this technology. Investigation and analysis are necessary for the development of protocols to utilize CGM trend arrows, alerts, and alarms.","Longo, Rebecca Rick; Elias, Heather; Khan, Mehvish; Seley, Jane Jefferie",J Diabetes Sci Technol,,597

The aim of the study was to assess the influence of the confinement situation caused by COVID-19 on the levels of self-perceived health and psychological capital in a sample of workers, as well as to analyze whether exposure to burnout before social isolation would help to explain the levels of health and psychological capital. METHODS: Data were collected in a longitudinal design. Time 1 surveys (December 2019) were sent to a sample of 354 Spanish workers while in Time 2 (April 2020) the employees completed 235 questionnaires. RESULTS: Our findings indicate a significant worsening of employees' health perception (t = -4.13; p < 0.01) and psychological capital (4.10, p < 0.01) levels during mandatory confinement in Spain. Our results also revealed that emotional exhaustion is the only burnout dimension capable of explaining the variance of health while self-efficacy does regarding psychological capital. CONCLUSION: We conclude a significant reduction in self-perceived health and psychological capital during COVID-19 mandatory confinement, and that burnout acts as a predictor variable in both health and psychological capital variance.","Meseguer de Pedro, Mariano; Fernández-Valera, María Magdalena; García-Izquierdo, Mariano; Soler Sánchez, María Isabel",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,597

Thirty mice were allocated into the Control, LPS, and LPS + Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) group (n = 10/group). Mouse alveolar epithelial cells (MLE-12) and macrophage cells (RAW264.7) were divided into the same groups. Pathological variation, inflammation-related factors, reactive oxygen species (ROS), ATP levels, and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) were analyzed. Pathologic features of ARDS were observed in the LPS group and were significantly alleviated by BMSCs. The trend in inflammation-related factors among the three groups was the LPS group > LPS + BMSC group > Control group. In the MLE-12 co-culture system, IL-6 was increased in the LPS group but not significantly reduced in the LPS + BMSC group. In the RAW264.7 co-culture system, IL-1ß, TNF-&#945;, and IL-10 levels were all increased in the LPS group, IL-1ß and TNF-&#945; levels were reduced by BMSCs, while IL-10 level kept increasing.

Basal OCR, ATP-linked OCR, and maximal OCR were lower in the LPS groups. Impaired basal OCR and ATP-linked OCR in MLE-12 cells were partially restored by BMSCs, while impaired basal OCR and maximal OCR in RAW264.7 cells were restored by BMSCs.

The SPRi assay measures the antibody isotype levels and the strength of binding to the RBD of ultimate 384 patient samples in one run. It turns out that during the course of the disease, the IgG levels and strength of binding increased while generally the IgM and IgA levels go down. Recovered patients all show high strength of binding of the IgG type to the RBD protein. The anti-RBD immunoglobulins SPRi assay provides additional insights in the immune status of patients recovering from CoViD-19 and this new method can furthermore be applied for the assessment of the quality of the immune reaction of healthy individuals to SARS-CoV-2 in vaccination programs.","Schasfoort, Richard B M; van Weperen, Jos; van Amsterdam, Margot; Parisot, Judicaël; Hendriks, Jan; Koerselman, Michelle; Karperien, Marcel; Mentink, Anouk; Bennink, Martin; Krabbe, Hans; Terstappen, Leon Wmm; Mulder, A H Leontine",Biosens Bioelectron,,597

METHODS: A multi-site, cross-sectional, online survey of specialty clinic healthcare providers at 10 academic health systems with integrated specialty pharmacies was conducted. The questionnaire was developed by members of the Vizient Specialty Pharmacy Outcomes and Benchmarking Workgroup and was pretested at 3 pilot sites prior to dissemination. Prescribers of specialty medications within each institution were identified and sent an email invitation to participate in the study that included a link to the anonymous questionnaire. Respondents were asked to rate their agreement with 10 statements regarding quality of services of integrated and external specialty pharmacies on a 5-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree). An analysis to determine differences in providers' overall satisfaction with the integrated and external specialty pharmacy practice models, as well as differences in satisfaction scores for each of the 10 statements, was performed using paired-samples t tests. RESULTS: The mean (SD) score for overall satisfaction with integrated specialty pharmacies was significantly higher than the score for satisfaction with external specialty pharmacies: 4.72 (0.58) vs 2.97 (1.20); 95% confidence interval, 1.64-1.87; P < 0.001. Provider ratings of the integrated specialty pharmacy model were also higher for all 10 items evaluating the quality of services (P < 0.05 for all comparisons). CONCLUSION: The study results confirm that the health-system integrated specialty pharmacy practice model promotes high rates of provider satisfaction with services and perceived benefits.","Anguiano, Rebekah H; Zuckerman, Autumn D; Hall, Elizabeth; Diamantides, Erica; Kumor, Lisa; Duckworth, Deborah L; Peter, Megan; Sorgen, Patrick J; Nathanson, Amy; Kandah, Huda-Marie; Dura, Jillian; Campbell, Udobi",Am J Health Syst Pharm,,597

SARS-CoV-2 shares highly homological sequence with the most studied SARS-CoV, and causes acute, highly deadly pneumonia (COVID-19) with clinical symptoms similar to those reported for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Increasing evidence shows that these coronaviruses are not always confined to the respiratory tract and that they may also neuroinvasive and neurotropic, with potential neuropathological consequences in vulnerable populations. The aim of this study is to predict a likely CNS involvement by SARS-CoV-2 by studying the pathogenic mechanisms in common with other better known and studied coronaviruses with which it shares the same characteristics. Understanding the mechanisms of neuroinvasion and interaction of HCoV (including SARS-Cov-2) with the CNS is essential to evaluate potentially pathological short- and long-term consequences. Autopsies of the COVID-19 patients, detailed neurological investigation, and attempts to isolate SARS-CoV-2 from the endothelium of cerebral microcirculation, cerebrospinal fluid, glial cells, and neuronal tissue can clarify the role played by COVID-19 in CNS-involvement and in the ongoing mortalities as has been in the recent outbreak.","Armocida, Daniele; Palmieri, Mauro; Frati, Alessandro; Santoro, Antonio; Pesce, Alessandro",J Clin Neurosci,,597

The nonlinear (asymmetric) relationship is investigated between CO2 emission and COVID-19 with its specific determinants. The positive and negative asymmetries of COVID-19 determinants are also captured by using econometric techniques. The daily data series of CO2 emission, new confirmed cases, confirmed deaths, and lockdown as dummy variables from January 30, 2020, to December 1, 2020, for India is analyzed by employing the nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag model. This research revealed a significant nonlinear relationship between CO2 emission and COVID-19. The bound test and asymmetric coefficients are confirmed by the variables' long- and short-run relationships. The dynamic multiplier graphs present that India's strict lockdown due to the rapid increase in COVID-19 patients significantly reduces toxic gas emissions, especially CO2 emissions. This asymmetric relationship has been proficiently declared that unhealthy public routine, extra traffic, and unhygienic gases released in the air become the reason for environmental destruction. The lockdown is practically imposed for specific periods and reasons, contributing to reducing toxic emissions, but it is not a permanent solution for environmental sustainability. The government of India, policymakers, and environmentalists should make people aware of unhealthy and environmentally envying activities and policies and long-term applicable strategies should be designed to upgrade the environment's quality.","Sarfraz, Muddassar; Mohsin, Muhammad; Naseem, Sobia; Kumar, Amit",Environ Dev Sustain,,597

In the absence of an effective vaccine, inhibitor repurposing or de novo drug design may offer a longer-term strategy to combat this and future infections due to similar viruses. Here, we report on detailed classical and mixed-solvent molecular dynamics simulations of the main protease (Mpro) enriched by evolutionary and stability analysis of the protein. The results were compared with those for a highly similar severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) Mpro protein. In spite of a high level of sequence similarity, the active sites in both proteins showed major differences in both shape and size, indicating that repurposing SARS drugs for COVID-19 may be futile. Furthermore, analysis of the binding site's conformational changes during the simulation time indicated its flexibility and plasticity, which dashes hopes for rapid and reliable drug design. Conversely, structural stability of the protein with respect to flexible loop mutations indicated that the virus' mutability will pose a further challenge to the rational design of small-molecule inhibitors. However, few residues contribute significantly to the protein stability and thus can be considered as key anchoring residues for Mpro inhibitor design.","Bzówka, Maria; Mitusinska, Karolina; Raczynska, Agata; Samol, Aleksandra; Tuszynski, Jack A; Góra, Artur",,,597

In this study, a commercial compressed-polyurethane (C-PU) mask was modified by applying a hydrophobic and anti-droplet coating using a silica sol, which was formed by the hydrolysis of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) under alkaline conditions and hydrolyzed hexadecyltrimethoxysilane (HDTMS) to achieve hydrophobization. The modified mask (C-PU/Si/HDTMS) demonstrated good water repellency resulting in high water contact angle (132°) and low sliding angle (17°). Unmodified and modified masks were characterized using attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). A drainage test confirmed the strong interaction between the mask surface and coating. Moreover, the coating had negligible effect on the average pore size of the C-PU mask, which retained its high breathability after modification. The application of this coating is a facile approach to impart anti-droplet, hydrophobic, and self-cleaning characteristics to C-PU masks.","Ray, Saikat Sinha; Park, You-In; Park, Hosik; Nam, Seung-Eun; Kim, In-Chul; Kwon, Young-Nam",Environ.

However, COVID-19 related factors impacting the service uptake are not sufficiently addressed. Hence, the current study was intended to explore COVID-19 related factors influencing antenatal care service uptake in rural Ethiopia. METHODS: A community-based qualitative study was conducted from September 25/2020 to November 25/2020 among selected pregnant women residing in rural districts of Bench-Sheko Zone, and healthcare providers working in the local health care facilities. Six focus group discussions and 9 in-depth interviews were made between pregnant women, and health care providers, respectively. Data was collected by health education and behavioral science professionals who also have experience in qualitative data collection procedure. Data were transcribed, translated, and analyzed thematically using Open Code 4.0 software. RESULT: The study revealed several COVID-19 related factors influencing the uptake of antenatal care service during the pandemic. Health facility related barriers, perceived poor quality of care during the pandemic, government measures against COVID-19, anxiety related to the pandemic, and risk minimization were the identified factors possibly influencing the current antenatal care service uptake among women in rural Bench-Sheko Zone. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 preventive measures, and health facility related factors and individual factors were responsible for the current decline in antenatal care service uptake. Preserving essential health care service is critical to prevent avoidable losses of maternal and child lives during the pandemic period. Hence, programs and strategies designed to maintain maternal health services particularly, antenatal care service have better take the above determinants into consideration.","Hailemariam, Shewangizaw; Agegnehu, Wubetu; Derese, Misganaw",J Prim Care Community Health,,597

Whether these patterns were present in public hospitals is unknown. The aim of this brief study was to investigate COVID-19 hospitalizations and outcomes in the public health system during the initial pandemic response. Methods: A retrospective review was conducted on COVID-19 admissions in New York City public hospitals during the exponential phase of the pandemic. All data were collected from an integrated electronic medical records system (Epic Health Systems, Verona, WI). Overall, 5,422 patients with at least one admission each for COVID-19 were reviewed, with a study of demographic characteristics (including age, gender, race, BMI), pregnancy status, comorbidities, facility activity, and outcomes. Data related to hospitalization and mortality trends were also collected from City of New York website. These data often involved more than one facility and/or service line resulting in more location or treatment facility counts than patients due to utilization of services at more than one location and transfers between locations and facilities. Results: Higher mortality was associated with increasing age with the highest death rate (51.9%) noted in the age group >75 years (OR 7.88, 95%CI 6.32-10.08). Comorbidities with higher mortality included diabetes (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.33-1.70), hypertension (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.44-1.83), cardiovascular conditions (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.47-1.87), COPD (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.39-2.50). It was deduced that 20% of all New York City COVID-19 positive admissions were in public health system during this timeframe. A high proportion of admissions (21.26%) and deaths (19.93%) were at Elmhurst Hospital in Queens. Bellevue and Metropolitan Hospitals had the lowest number of deaths, both in borough of Manhattan. Mortality in public hospitals in Brooklyn was 29.9%, Queens 28.1%, Manhattan 20.4%. Conclusion: Significant variations existed in COVID-19 hospitalizations and outcomes in the public health system in New York City during the initial pandemic. Although outcomes are worse with older age and those with comorbidities, variations in hospitals and boroughs outside of Manhattan are targets to investigate and strategize efforts.","Dinesh, Anant; Mallick, Taha; Arreglado, Tatiana M; Altonen, Brian L; Engdahl, Ryan",Front Public Health,,597
524248,"Covid-19: When to start invasive ventilation is ""the million dollar question""",2021,"BACKGROUND: Cardiac dysfunction, mainly assessed by biomarker alterations, has been described in COVID-19 infection. However, there are still areas of uncertainty regarding its effective role in disease evolution. Aim of this study was to evaluate early echocardiographic parameters in COVID pneumonia and their association with severity disease and prognosis. METHODS: An echocardiographic examination was performed within 72 h from admission in 64 consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia in our medium-intensity care unit, from March 30th to May 15th 2020. Six patients were excluded for inadequate acoustic window. RESULTS: Fifty-eight consecutive patients were finally enrolled, with a median age of 58 years. Twenty-two (38%) were classifiable as severe COVID-19 disease. Eight out of 58 patients experienced adverse evolution (six died, two were admitted to ICU and received mechanical ventilation), all of them in the severe pneumonia group. Severe pneumonia patients showed higher troponin, IL-6 and D-Dimer values. No significant new onset alterations of left and right ventricular systolic function parameters were observed. Patients with severe pneumonia showed higher mean estimated systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) (30.7 ± 5.2 mmHg vs 26.2 ± 4.3 mmHg, p = 0.006), even if in the normality range values. No differences in echocardiographic parameters were retrieved in patients with adverse events with respect to those with favorable clinical course. CONCLUSION: A mild sPAP increase in severe pneumonia patients with respect to those with milder disease was the only significant finding at early echocardiographic examination, without other signs of new onset major cardiac dysfunction. Future studies are needed to deepen the knowledge regarding minor cardiac functional perturbation in the evolution of a complex systemic disorder, in which the respiratory involvement appears as the main character, at least in non-ICU patients.","Ceriani, Elisa; Marceca, Azzurra; Lanfranchi, Antonio; De Vita, Stefano; Schiavon, Riccardo; Casella, Francesco; Torzillo, Daniela; Del Medico, Marta; Ruggiero, Diego; Barosi, Alberto; Cogliati, Chiara",Intern. emerg. med,,597

Baricitinib, a clinically approved JAK1/2 inhibitor with potent anti-inflammatory properties is currently being investigated in COVID-19 human clinical trials. Recent reports suggest that baricitinib may also have antiviral activity in limiting viral endocytosis. Here, we investigated the immunologic and virologic efficacy of baricitinib in a rhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Viral shedding measured from nasal and throat swabs, bronchoalveolar lavages and tissues was not reduced with baricitinib. Type I IFN antiviral responses and SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses remained similar between the two groups. Importantly, however, animals treated with baricitinib showed reduced immune activation, decreased infiltration of neutrophils into the lung, reduced NETosis activity, and more limited lung pathology. Moreover, baricitinib treated animals had a rapid and remarkably potent suppression of alveolar macrophage derived production of cytokines and chemokines responsible for inflammation and neutrophil recruitment. These data support a beneficial role for, and elucidate the immunological mechanisms underlying, the use of baricitinib as a frontline treatment for severe inflammation induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Hoang, Timothy N.; Pino, Maria; Boddapati, Arun K.; Viox, Elise G.; Starke, Carly E.; Upadhyay, Amit A.; Gumber, Sanjeev; Busman-Sahay, Kathleen; Strongin, Zachary; Harper, Justin L.; Tharp, Gregory K.; Pellegrini, Kathryn L.; Kirejczyk, Shannon; Zandi, Keivan; Tao, Sijia; Horton, Tristan R.; Beagle, Elizabeth N.; Mahar, Ernestine A.; Lee, Michelle YH; Cohen, Joyce; Jean, Sherrie M.; Wood, Jennifer S.; Connor-Stroud, Fawn; Stammen, Rachelle L.; Delmas, Olivia M.; Wang, Shelly; Cooney, Kimberly A.; Sayegh, Michael N.; Wang, Lanfang; Weiskopf, Daniela; Filev, Peter D.; Waggoner, Jesse; Piantadosi, Anne; Kasturi, Sudhir P.; Al-Shakhshir, Hilmi; Ribeiro, Susan P.; Sekaly, Rafick P.; Levit, Rebecca D.; Estes, Jacob D.; Vanderford, Thomas H.; Schinazi, Raymond F.; Bosinger, Steven E.; Paiardini, Mirko",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.16.300277; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32995780/,597

However, there is no computerized tool to automatically delineate COVID‐19 infection regions in chest CT scans for quantitative assessment in advanced applications such as severity prediction. The aim of this study is to develop a deep learning (DL) based method for automatic segmentation and quantification of infection regions as well as the entire lungs from chest CT scans. METHODS: The DL‐based segmentation method employs the “VB‐Net” neural network to segment COVID‐19 infection regions in CT scans. The developed DL‐based segmentation system is trained by CT scans from 249 COVID‐19 patients, and further validated by CT scans from other 300 COVID‐19 patients. To accelerate the manual delineation of CT scans for training, a human‐involved‐model‐iterations (HIMI) strategy is also adopted to assist radiologists to refine automatic annotation of each training case. To evaluate the performance of the DL‐based segmentation system, three metrics, i.e., Dice similarity coefficient, the differences of volume, and percentage of infection (POI), are calculated between automatic and manual segmentations on the validation set. Then, a clinical study on severity prediction is reported based on the quantitative infection assessment. RESULTS: The proposed DL‐based segmentation system yielded Dice similarity coefficients of 91.6%±10.0% between automatic and manual segmentations, and a mean POI estimation error of 0.3% for the whole lung on the validation dataset. Moreover, compared with the cases with fully manual delineation that often takes hours, the proposed HIMI training strategy can dramatically reduce the delineation time to 4 minutes after 3 iterations of model updating. Besides, the best accuracy of severity prediction was 73.4%±1.3% when the mass of infection (MOI) of multiple lung lobes and bronchopulmonary segments were used as features for severity prediction, indicating the potential clinical application of our quantification technique on severity prediction. CONCLUSIONS: A DL‐based segmentation system has been developed to automatically segment and quantify infection regions in CT scans of COVID‐19 patients. Quantitative evaluation indicated high accuracy in automatic infection delineation and severity prediction.","Shan, Fei; Gao, Yaozong; Wang, Jun; Shi, Weiya; Shi, Nannan; Han, Miaofei; Xue, Zhong; Shen, Dinggang; Shi, Yuxin",Med Phys,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33225476/; https://doi.org/10.1002/mp.14609,597
593038,P-101 IMPACT OF COMPLETE AND PREVENTIVE LOCKED–DOWN BEFORE COVID 19 OUTBREAK IN ORGAN PROCUREMENT AND SOLID TRANSPLANTATION IN ARGENTINA: THE WORST HAS NOT YET ARRIVED.,2021-09-30,"Cardiovascular diseases are the main cause of death worldwide, with sleep disordered breathing being a further aggravating factor. Respiratory illnesses are the third leading cause of death amongst the noncommunicable diseases. The current COVID-19 pandemic, however, also highlights the impact of communicable respiratory syndromes. In the clinical routine, prolonged postanesthetic respiratory instability worsens the patient outcome. Even though early and continuous, long-term cardiorespiratory monitoring has been proposed or even proven to be beneficial in several situations, implementations thereof are sparse. We employed our recently presented, multimodal patch stethoscope to estimate Einthoven electrocardiogram (ECG) Lead I and II from a single 55 mm ECG lead. Using the stethoscope and ECG subsystems, the pre-ejection period (PEP) and left ventricular ejection time (LVET) were estimated. ECG-derived respiration techniques were used in conjunction with a novel, phonocardiogram-derived respiration approach to extract respiratory parameters. Medical-grade references were the SOMNOmedics SOMNO HD(TM) and Osypka ICON-Core(TM). In a study including 10 healthy subjects, we analyzed the performances in the supine, lateral, and prone position. Einthoven I and II estimations yielded correlations exceeding 0.97. LVET and PEP estimation errors were 10% and 21%, respectively. Respiratory rates were estimated with mean absolute errors below 1.2 bpm, and the respiratory signal yielded a correlation of 0.66. We conclude that the estimation of ECG, PEP, LVET, and respiratory parameters is feasible using a wearable, multimodal acquisition device and encourage further research in multimodal signal fusion for respiratory signal estimation.","Klum, Michael; Urban, Mike; Tigges, Timo; Pielmus, Alexandru-Gabriel; Feldheiser, Aarne; Schmitt, Theresa; Orglmeister, Reinhold",Sensors (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/s20072033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32260436/,597
593207,Human talent in geriatrics in Colombia and its relevance for the management of COVID-19,2021-02-01,"Abstract Immunity transfer from a mother to the newborn does not depend exclusively on immunoglobulins. Peptides, which are characterized by immunoregulatory properties that accompany IgG2, known as proline- rich polypeptide complex (PRP), have been discovered for the first time in ovine colostrum. In this report we present new data showing that some immunoregulatory peptides associated with the main immunoglobulin class, IgY, are also present in the avian immune system. Cytokine-inducing activity of particular fractions obtained from ovine colostrum, IgG+ (IgG2 containing PRP), IgG− (IgG2 free of PRP), and purified PRP, was compared with that of crude egg yolk IgY (IgY+), additionally purified egg yolk IgY (IgY−), and polypeptides accompanying IgY named Yolkin (Y), using an ex vivo model of whole human blood cells. It was shown that both IgG+ fraction and PRP, but not IgG−, stimulated the whole blood cells to release tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β cytokines. Similar experiments performed with hen's egg IgY preparations showed that IgY+ and Y samples showed higher cytokine-inducing activity than samples additionally purified with the use of size exclusion chromatography (IgY−). The IgY+ at a dose of 100 μg was even more active than the positive lipopolysaccharide control. It was also found that Y is able to stimulate macrophage cell line J774.2 to release nitric oxide. The results obtained suggest that IgY, the main chicken immunoglobulin fraction, is accompanied by additional polypeptides and plays a role of a transporter of biologically active substances, which was observed in the case of colostral IgG.","Polanowski, A.; Zabłocka, A.; Sosnowska, A.; Janusz, M.; Trziszka, T.",Poultry Science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23155018/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0032579119394088; https://doi.org/10.3382/ps.2012-02546; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032579119394088,597

Given the rapidly growing pandemic and the overwhelmed medical system, there is an urgent need of alternative medicine to help children relieve symptoms during self-quarantine, and possibly to help increase their chances of survival and recovery from COVID-19. By using various manual techniques at specified locations on the surface of the body, pediatric massage manipulation can unblock meridians, promote the circulation of qi and blood and strengthen resistance to pathogens. METHODS: We will search the following electronic databases: Wanfang and Pubmed Database, CNKI, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE and MEDLINE. Each database will be searched from inception to June 2020. The entire process will include study selection, data extraction, risk of bias assessment and meta-analyses. RESULTS: This systematic review will evaluate the existing evidence of pediatric massage therapy for restoring pediatric lung function from COVID-19. The outcomes will include the improvement of pulmonary function and adverse effect.

As of July 21(st), 2020, there had been 14.35 million confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 0.60 million deaths in 216 countries. Design and Methods: The study explores health and wellbeing in universities within the G20 countries (19 member countries and the European Union) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The sample selection of these countries was considered since it serves around 80% of the world’s economic output, two-thirds of the global population (including more than half of the world’s poor), and 75% of international trade. Specifically, due to this public health concern, schools’ nationwide closures are impacting over 60% of the world’s student population to promote their quality of life and well-being. Results: This study investigates the G20 policies and procedures within higher education regarding health and well-being measures during the COVID-19 epidemic. The findings reveal that the lockdown, social distancing, and self-isolation requirements are stressful and detrimental for many individuals and have caused students’ health and well-being concerns. Conclusions: Several countries within the G20 have taken significant steps to support health and well-being issues for university students; however, numerous countries are far behind in addressing this issue. Hence, government leaders of G20 countries, policymakers, and health providers should promptly take the necessary measures to regulate the outbreak, improve safety measures to decrease disease transmission, and administer those who demand medical attention.","Nurunnabi, Mohammad; Almusharraf, Norah; Aldeghaither, Dalal",J Public Health Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33575229/; https://doi.org/10.4081/jphr.2020.2010,597

We evaluated an association between NSAID use and outcomes of Covid-19. This study was a retrospective observational cohort study based on insurance benefit claims sent to the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service of Korea by May 15, 2020. These claims comprised all Covid-19-tested cases and history of medical service use for the past 3 years in these patients. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, and the secondary outcome was need for ventilator care. Among 7590 patients diagnosed with Covid-19, two distinct cohorts were generated based on NSAID or acetaminophen prescription within 2 weeks before Covid-19 diagnosis. A total of 398 patients was prescribed NSAIDs, and 2365 patients were prescribed acetaminophen. After propensity score matching, 397 pairs of data set were generated, and all-cause mortality of the NSAIDs group showed no significant difference compared with the acetaminophen group (4.0% vs. 3.0%; hazard ratio [HR], 1.33; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.63–2.88; P = 0.46). The rate of ventilator care also did not show significantly different results between the two groups (2.0% vs. 1.3%; HR, 1.60; 95% CI 0.53–5.30; P = 0.42).

While endotheliopathy is thought to be a key factor of COVID-19-associated coagulopathy, markers indicative of this process that are prognostic of disease severity have not been well-established in this patient population. Using plasma profiling of patients with COVID-19, we identified circulating markers that segregated with disease severity: markers of angiogenesis (VEGF-A, PDGF-AA and PDGF-AB/BB) were elevated in hospitalized patients with non-critical COVID-19 infection, while markers of endothelial injury (angiopoietin-2, FLT-3L, PAI-1) were elevated in patients with critical COVID-19 infection. In survival analysis, elevated markers of endothelial injury (angiopoietin-2, follistatin, PAI-1) were strongly predictive of in-hospital mortality. Our findings demonstrate that non-critical and critical phases of COVID-19 disease may be driven by distinct mechanisms involving key aspects of endothelial cell function, and identify drivers of COVID-19 pathogenesis and potential targets for future therapies.","Pine, Alexander B.; Meizlish, Matthew L.; Goshua, George; Chang, C-Hong; Zhang, Hanming; Bishai, Jason; Bahel, Parveen; Patel, Amisha; Gbyli, Rana; Kwan, Jennifer M.; Won, Christine H.; Price, Christina; Dela Cruz, Charles S.; Halene, Stephanie; van Dijk, David; Hwa, John; Lee, Alfred I.; Chun, Hyung J.",Pulm Circ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33282193/; https://doi.org/10.1177/2045894020966547,597
595844,Importations of COVID-19 into African countries and risk of onward spread,2020-05-24,"BACKGROUND: Up to 50% of medicines are not used as intended, resulting in poor health and economic outcomes. Medicines optimisation is ‘a person-centred approach to safe and effective medicines use, to ensure people obtain the best possible outcomes from their medicines’. The purpose of this exercise was to co-produce a prioritised research agenda for medicines optimisation using a multi-stakeholder (patient, researcher, public and health professionals) approach. METHODS: A three-stage, multiple method process was used including: generation of preliminary research questions (Stage 1) using a modified Nominal Group Technique; electronic consultation and ranking with a wider multi-stakeholder group (Stage 2); a face-to-face, one-day consensus meeting involving representatives from all stakeholder groups (Stage 3). RESULTS: In total, 92 research questions were identified during Stages 1 and 2 and ranked in order of priority during stage 3. Questions were categorised into four areas: ‘Patient Concerns’ [e.g. is there a shared decision (with patients) about using each medicine?], ‘Polypharmacy’ [e.g. how to design health services to cope with the challenge of multiple medicines use?], ‘Non-Medical Prescribing’ [e.g. how can the contribution of non-medical prescribers be optimised in primary care?], and ‘Deprescribing’ [e.g. what support is needed by prescribers to deprescribe?]. A significant number of the 92 questions were generated by Patient and Public Involvement representatives, which demonstrates the importance of including this stakeholder group when identifying research priorities. CONCLUSIONS: A wide range of research questions was generated reflecting concerns which affect patients, practitioners, the health service, as well the ethical and philosophical aspects of the prescribing and deprescribing of medicines.

Fhx/P25, a glycoprotein, associates noncovalently with the H–L heterodimers. The elementary unit was found and purified from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) extract of PSG cells. A substantial amount of fhx/P25 unassembled into the elementary unit was also present in ER. In normal‐level fibroin‐producing breeds (J‐139 and C108), the elementary unit contained fhx/P25 of either 30 kDa (major) or 27 kDa (minor). The 27‐kDa fhx/P25 was produced from the 30‐kDa form by digestion with the bacterial α1,2‐mannosidase in vitro. The elementary unit in the ER extract contained only the 30‐kDa fhx/P25, whereas both 30‐ and 27‐kDa forms of fhx/P25 were present in the ER plus Golgi mixed extracts. In naked‐pupa mutants [Nd(2), Nd‐s and Nd‐s (D)], extremely small amounts of fibroin were produced and they consisted of one molecule of 27‐kDa fhx/P25 and six molecules of H‐chain but no L‐chain. When the Nd‐s (D) mutant was subjected to transgenesis with the normal L‐chain gene, the (H‐L)(6)fhx(1)‐type elementary unit containing the 30‐kDa fhx/P25, was produced. These results suggest that fhx/P25 in the elementary unit is largely protected from digestion with Golgi α1,2‐mannosidases when L‐chains are present in the unit. Models suggesting a role of L‐chain for the protection of α1,2‐mannose residues of fhx/P25 are presented.","Inoue, Satoshi; Tanaka, Kazunori; Tanaka, Hiromitsu; Ohtomo, Kohei; Kanda, Toshio; Imamura, Morikazu; Quan, Guo‐Xing; Kojima, Katsura; Yamashita, Tetsuro; Nakajima, Tasuku; Taira, Hideharu; Tamura, Toshiki; Mizuno, Shigeki",Eur J Biochem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14717703/,597

Clinical evidence suggests that COVID-19 patients can be classified as non-severe, severe and critical cases. In particular, studies have highlighted the relationship between the lymphopenia and the severity of the illness, where CD8 [Formula: see text] T cells have the lowest levels in critical cases. However, quantitative understanding of the immune responses in COVID-19 patients is still missing. Objectives: In this work, we aim to elucidate the key parameters that define the course of the disease deviating from severe to critical cases. Dynamics of different immune cells are taken into account in mechanistic models to elucidate those that contribute to the worsening of the disease. Methods: Several mathematical models based on ordinary differential equations are proposed to represent data sets of different immune response cells dynamics such as CD8 [Formula: see text] T cells, NK cells, and also CD4 [Formula: see text] T cells in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Parameter fitting is performed using the differential evolution algorithm. Non-parametric bootstrap approach is introduced to abstract the stochastic environment of the infection. Results: The mathematical model that represents the data more appropriately is considering CD8 [Formula: see text] T cell dynamics. This model had a good fit to reported experimental data, and in accordance with values found in the literature. The NK cells and CD4 [Formula: see text] T cells did not contribute enough to explain the dynamics of the immune responses. Conclusions: Our computational results highlight that a low viral clearance rate by CD8 [Formula: see text] T cells could lead to the severity of the disease. This deregulated clearance suggests that it is necessary immunomodulatory strategies during the course of the infection to avoid critical states in COVID-19 patients.","Blanco-Rodríguez, Rodolfo; Du, Xin; Hernández-Vargas, Esteban",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34610492/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0169260721004867; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2021.106412; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169260721004867?v=s5,597

This study, then, examined the ability of personal and environmental variables to predict telemedicine adoption during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 230 physicians practicing in the U.S. completed questions concerning personal and environmental characteristics, as well as telemedicine use at three time points: pre-pandemic, during the pandemic, and anticipated future use. Associations between use and characteristics were determined to identify factors important for telemedicine use. Physicians reported that telemedicine accounted for 3.72% of clinical work prior to the pandemic, 46.03% during the pandemic, and predicted 25.44% after the pandemic ends. Physicians within hospitals reported less increase in telemedicine use during the pandemic than within group practice (p = 0.016) and less increase in use at hospitals compared to academic medical centers (p = 0.027) and group practice (p = 0.008). Greater telemedicine use was associated with more years in practice (p = 0.009), supportive organizational policies (p = 0.001), organizational encouragement (p = 0.003), expectations of greater patient volume (p = 0.003), and perceived higher quality of patient care (p = 0.032). Characteristics such as gender, number of physicians, and level of telemedicine training were not significant predictors. Organizations interested in supporting physicians to adopt telemedicine should encourage its use and create policies supporting its use.

600452,A simple laboratory parameter facilitates early identification of COVID-19 patients,2020-02-17,"Background: The National Early Warning Score (NEWS) is an assessment scale of in-hospital patients’ conditions. The purpose of this study was to assess the appropriateness of a potential off-label use of NEWS by the emergency medical system (EMS) to facilitate the identification of critical patients and to trigger appropriate care in the pre-hospital setting. Methods: A single centre, longitudinal, prospective study was carried out between July and August 2020 in the EMS service of Bologna. Home patients with age ≥ 18 years old were included in the study. The exclusion criterion was the impossibility to collect all the parameters needed to measure NEWS. Results: A total of 654 patients were enrolled in the study. The recorded NEWS values increased along with the severity of dispatch priority code, the EMS return code, the emergency department triage code, and with patients’ age (r = 0.135; p = 0.001). The aggregated value of NEWS was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization (OR = 1.30 (1.17; 1.34); p < 0.0001). Conclusion: This study showed that the use of NEWS in the urgent and emergency care services can help patient assessment while not affecting EMS crew operation and might assist decision making in terms of severity-code assignment and resources utilization.","Semeraro, Federico; Corona, Giovanni; Scquizzato, Tommaso; Gamberini, Lorenzo; Valentini, Anna; Tartaglione, Marco; Scapigliati, Andrea; Ristagno, Giuseppe; Martella, Carmela; Descovich, Carlo; Picoco, Cosimo; Gordini, Giovanni",J Clin Med,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10122617; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34198651/,597

The NLRP3 inflammasome, which cleaves IL-1β, IL-18, and gasdermin D, must be tightly regulated to avoid excessive inflammation. Here we provide evidence that itaconate modifies NLRP3 and inhibits inflammasome activation. Itaconate and its derivative, 4-octyl itaconate (4-OI), inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation, but not AIM2 or NLRC4. Conversely, NLRP3 activation was increased in itaconate-depleted Irg1(−/−) macrophages. 4-OI inhibited the interaction between NLRP3 and NEK7, a key step in the activation process, and “dicarboxypropylated” C548 on NLRP3. Furthermore, 4-OI inhibited NLRP3-dependent IL-1β release from PBMCs isolated from cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS) patients, and reduced inflammation in an in vivo model of urate-induced peritonitis. Our results identify itaconate as an endogenous metabolic regulator of the NLRP3 inflammasome and describe a process that may be exploited therapeutically to alleviate inflammation in NLRP3-driven disorders.","Hooftman, Alexander; Angiari, Stefano; Hester, Svenja; Corcoran, Sarah E.; Runtsch, Marah C.; Ling, Chris; Ruzek, Melanie C.; Slivka, Peter F.; McGettrick, Anne F.; Banahan, Kathy; Hughes, Mark M.; Irvine, Alan D.; Fischer, Roman; O’Neill, Luke A.J.",Cell Metab,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32791101/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1550413120304113; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413120304113; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2020.07.016,597

Here we examine the properties of highly potent human monoclonal antibodies (hu-mAbs) in a mouse adapted model of SARS-CoV-2 infection (SARS-CoV-2 MA). In vitro antibody neutralization potency did not uniformly correlate with in vivo activity, and some hu-mAbs were more potent in combination in vivo. Analysis of antibody Fc regions revealed that binding to activating Fc receptors is essential for optimal protection against SARS-CoV-2 MA.

Its curative treatment is unknown and is the subject of several clinical trials. In addition, the concomitant association of COVID-19 with tuberculosis and the human immunodeficiency virus, hitherto never described, is potentially fatal. We report the illustrative case of a 32-year-old patient who presented this trifecta of infections and who did well under treatment with chloroquine and anti-mycobacterial drugs. This patient arrived at the ER with respiratory discomfort that had been evolving over a month with symptoms of flu and deterioration of her general condition. A chest CT scan revealed an aspect of lung miliary tuberculosis with isolation of Koch’s bacilli in the sputum. A polymerization chain reaction (PCR) was positive for COVID-19 on a nasopharyngeal swab. HIV serology was positive. The course was marked by a spectacular clinical improvement and two negative COVID-19 PCR controls at the end of treatment (at days 9 and 10). Anti-tubercular drugs (especially, rifampin) are powerful enzyme inducers that can reduce the effectiveness of chloroquine in our patient. This therapeutic success may be linked to the effect of anti-tubercular drugs against SARS ncov-2, especially rifampin, inhibiting the formation of messenger RNAs of SARS ncov-2 or to the synergistic effect of chloroquine and rifampin.

602089,Sex disparities in COVID-19 outcomes of diabetic patients.,2021-09-01,"BACKGROUND: Age is considered as one of the most important risk-factor for many types of solid and hematological cancers, as their incidence increases with age in parallel to the ever-growing elderly population. Moreover, cancer incidence is constantly increasing as a consequence of the increase in life expectancy that favors the process of cellular senescence. Geriatric assessment has been increasingly recognized as predictive and prognostic instrument to detect frailty in older adults with cancer. In particular, the G8 score is a simple and reproducible instrument to identify elderly patients who should undergo full geriatric evaluation. Due to their frailty, elderly patients may be often under-treated and a therapeutic choice based also on a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is recommended. With these premises, we aim to test the impact of the CGA based interventions on the quality of life (QoL) of frail elderly onco-hematological patients, identified by the G8 screening, candidate for innovative target directed drugs or treatments including the combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy (RT + CT). METHODS: Patients aged > 65 years, candidate to target directed agents or to RT + CT treatments are screened for frailty by the G8 test; those patients classified as frail (G8 ≤ 14) are randomized to receive a CGA at baseline or to conventional care. The primary endpoint is QoL, assessed by EORTC QLQ-C30C. As collateral biological study, the potential prognostic/predictive role of T-cell senescence and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) are evaluated on plasma samples. DISCUSSION: This trial will contribute to define the impact of CGA on the management of frail elderly onco-hematologic patients candidate to innovative biological drugs or to integrated schedules with the association of RT + CT. Furthermore, the use of plasma samples to assess the potential prognostic value of imbalance of immune-competent cells is expected to contribute to the individualized care of elderly patients, resulting into a fine tuning of the therapeutic strategies.

MATERIALS & METHODS: An observational clinical study of individuals with flu‐like symptoms was conducted between July and September 2020. Dental biofilm (BIO) samples were collected and analysed using real‐time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‐qPCR) to determine the virus's presence. RESULTS: Seventy participants (40 ± 9.8 years of age, 71.4% female) tested positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA in NASO/ORO samples and were included in the study.

602389,Orthopaedic nursing and the COVID19 pandemic: the first few months,2020-08-31,"Simultaneously controlling COVID-19 epidemics and limiting economic and societal impacts presents a difficult challenge, especially with limited public health budgets. Testing, contact tracing, and isolating/quarantining is a key strategy that has been used to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 and other pathogens. However, manual contact tracing is a time-consuming process and as case numbers increase a smaller fraction of cases’ contacts can be traced, leading to additional virus spread. Delays between symptom onset and being tested (and receiving results), and a low fraction of symptomatic cases being tested and traced can also reduce the impact of contact tracing on transmission. We examined the relationship between increasing cases and delays and the pathogen reproductive number R(t), and the implications for infection dynamics using deterministic and stochastic compartmental models of SARS-CoV-2. We found that R(t) increased sigmoidally with the number of cases due to decreasing contact tracing efficacy. This relationship results in accelerating epidemics because R(t) initially increases, rather than declines, as infections increase. Shifting contact tracers from locations with high and low case burdens relative to capacity to locations with intermediate case burdens maximizes their impact in reducing R(t) (but minimizing total infections may be more complicated). Contact tracing efficacy decreased sharply with increasing delays between symptom onset and tracing and with lower fraction of symptomatic infections being tested. Finally, testing and tracing reductions in R(t) can sometimes greatly delay epidemics due to the highly heterogeneous transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. These results demonstrate the importance of having an expandable or mobile team of contact tracers that can be used to control surges in cases. They also highlight the synergistic value of high capacity, easy access testing and rapid turn-around of testing results, and outreach efforts to encourage symptomatic cases to be tested immediately after symptom onset.","Gardner, Billy J.; Kilpatrick, A.

603562,Making the news: Victim characteristics associated with media reporting on firearm injury,2020-10-04,"BACKGROUND: The severity of COVID-19, as well as the speed and scale of its spread, has posed a global challenge. Countries around the world have implemented stringent non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) to control transmission and prevent health systems from being overwhelmed. These NPI have had profound negative social and economic impacts. With the timeline to worldwide vaccine roll-out being uncertain, governments need to consider to what extent they need to implement and how to de-escalate these NPI. This rapid review collates de-escalation criteria reported in the literature to provide a guide to criteria that could be used as part of de-escalation strategies globally. METHODS: We reviewed literature published since 2000 relating to pandemics and infectious disease outbreaks. The searches included Embase.com (includes Embase and Medline), LitCovid, grey literature searching, reference harvesting and citation tracking. Over 1,700 documents were reviewed, with 39 documents reporting de-escalation criteria included in the final analysis. Concepts retrieved through a thematic analysis of the included documents were interlinked to build a conceptual dynamic de-escalation framework. RESULTS: We identified 52 de-escalation criteria, the most common of which were clustered under surveillance (cited by 43 documents, 10 criteria e.g. ability to actively monitor confirmed cases and contact tracing), health system capacity (cited by 30 documents, 11 criteria, e.g. ability to treat all patients within normal capacity) and epidemiology (cited by 28 documents, 7 criteria, e.g. number or changes in case numbers). De-escalation is a gradual and bi-directional process, and resurgence of infections or emergence of variants of concerns can lead to partial or full re-escalation(s) of response and control measures in place. Hence, it is crucial to rely on a robust public health surveillance system. CONCLUSIONS: This rapid review focusing on de-escalation within the context of COVID-19 provides a conceptual framework and a guide to criteria that countries can use to formulate de-escalation plans.

Gold cluster could significantly inhibit 3CLpro of SARS-COV-2. Phenyl isothiocyanate and Vitamin K3 could well suppress the activity of 3CLpro. For Mpro inhibition, IC50 of auranofin, Vitamin K3, phenyl isothiocyanate, gold cluster are about 0.51μM, 7.96μM, 10.13μM, 1.61μM, respectively.

The control groups were non-COVID-19 locals. Session 1 was completed for 126 COVID-19 survivors and 126 controls. Session 2 was completed for 47 COVID-19 survivors and 43 controls. The total score of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) score was significantly higher in COVID-19 survivors compared with controls in both sessions. The PCL-5 score in COVID-19 survivors was positively correlated with the duration after discharge (r = 0.27, p = 0.003 for Session 1), and increased by 20% from Session 1 to Session 2 for the survivors who participated both sessions. The increase was positively correlated with individual’s test-retest duration (r = 0.46, p = 0.03). Brain structural volume and functional activity in bilateral hippocampus and amygdala were significantly larger in COVID-19 survivors compared with controls.

TMPRSS11A is a TTSP expressed on the surface of airway epithelial cells, which has been shown to cleave and activate spike proteins of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (CoVs). In this study, we examined the mechanism underlying the activation cleavage of TMPRSS11A that converts the one-chain zymogen to a two-chain enzyme. By expression in human embryonic kidney 293, esophageal EC9706, and lung epithelial A549 and 16HBE cells, Western blotting, and site-directed mutagenesis, we found that the activation cleavage of human TMPRSS11A was mediated by autocatalysis. Moreover, we found that TMPRSS11A activation cleavage occurred before the protein reached the cell surface, as indicated by studies with trypsin digestion to remove cell surface proteins, treatment with cell organelle-disturbing agents to block intracellular protein trafficking, and analysis of a soluble form of TMPRSS11A without the transmembrane domain. We also showed that TMPRSS11A was able to cleave the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. These results reveal an intracellular autocleavage mechanism in TMPRSS11A zymogen activation, which differs from the extracellular zymogen activation reported in other TTSPs. These findings provide new insights into the diverse mechanisms in regulating TTSP activation.","Zhang, Ce; Zhang, Yikai; Zhang, Shengnan; Wang, Zhiting; Sun, Shijin; Liu, Meng; Chen, Yue; Dong, Ningzheng; Wu, Qingyu",J Biol Chem,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021925817499832; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32675285/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925817499832; https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.ra120.014525,597
605608,COVID-19: The road to recovery,2020-05-19,"Definition of the incubation period for COVID-19 is critical for implementing quarantine and thus infection control. Whereas the classical definition relies on the time from exposure to time of first symptoms, a more practical working definition is the time from exposure to time of first live virus excretion. For COVID-19, average incubation period times commonly span 5-7 days which are generally longer than for most typical other respiratory viruses. There is considerable variability reported however for the late right-hand statistical distribution. A small but yet epidemiologically important subset of patients may have the late end of the incubation period extend beyond the 14 days that is frequently assumed. Conservative assumptions of the right tail end distribution favour safety, but pragmatic working modifications may be required to accommodate high rates of infection and/or healthcare worker exposures. Despite the advent of effective vaccines, further attention and study in these regards are warranted. It is predictable that vaccine application will be associated with continued confusion over protection and its longevity. Measures for the application of infectivity will continue to be extremely relevant.","Cimolai, Nevio",Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33915459/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033350621001207; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2021.03.011; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033350621001207?v=s5,597

The study aims to investigate the occurrence and characteristics of co-infection and secondary infection in COVID-19 patients, mainly focusing on Streptococcus pneumoniae co-infections. Methods This study was a prospective, observational cohort study of the inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 in two designated hospitals in south China enrolled between Jan 11 and Feb 22, 2020. The urine specimen was collected on admission and applied for pneumococcal urinary antigen tests (PUATs). Demographic, clinical and microbiological data of patients were recorded simultaneously. Result A total of 146 patients with a confirm diagnosis of COVID-19 at the median age of 50.0 years (IQR 36.0-61.0) were enrolled, in which, 16 (11.0%) were classified as severe cases and 130 (89.0%) as non-severe cases. Of the enrolled patients, only 3 (2.1%) were considered to present the co-infection, in which 1 was co-infected with S.pneumoniae, 1 with B. Ovatus infection and the other one with Influenza A virus infection. Secondary infection occurred in 16 patients, with S. maltophilia as the most commonly isolated pathogen (43.8%), followed by P. aeruginosa (25.0%), E. aerogenes (25.0%), C. parapsilosis (25.0%) and A. fumigates (18.8%). Conclusion Patients with confirmed COVID-19 were rarely co-infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae or other pathogens, indicating that the application of antibiotics against CAP on admission may not be necessary in the treatment of COVID-19 cases.","Guo, Yingyi; Qu, Jiuxin; Cheng, Lingling; Li, Xiaohe; Liu, Ningjing; Li, Tungngai; Jiang, Ying; Wan, Qiao; Zhuo, Chuyue; Xiao, Shunian; Liu, Baomo; Chen, Yan; Fu, lin; Chen, Zhixu; Ma, Mingcong; zhuo, Chao; Zhong, Nanshan",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.06.425542,597

Recently, with the increasing availability of RNA structure data, new methods based on machine learning (ML) technologies, especially deep learning, have alleviated the issue. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of RNA secondary structure prediction methods based on ML technologies and a tabularized summary of the most important methods in this field.

The pandemic that originated from Wuhan, China in late 2019 has affected all the nations of the world and triggered a global economic crisis whose impact will be felt for years to come. This necessitates the need to monitor and predict COVID-19 prevalence for adequate control. The linear regression models are prominent tools in predicting the impact of certain factors on COVID-19 outbreak and taking the necessary measures to respond to this crisis. The data was extracted from the NCDC website and spanned from March 31, 2020 to May 29, 2020. In this study, we adopted the ordinary least squares estimator to measure the impact of travelling history and contacts on the spread of COVID-19 in Nigeria and made a prediction. The model was conducted before and after travel restriction was enforced by the Federal government of Nigeria. The fitted model fitted well to the dataset and was free of any violation based on the diagnostic checks conducted. The results show that the government made a right decision in enforcing travelling restriction because we observed that travelling history and contacts made increases the chances of people being infected with COVID-19 by 85% and 88% respectively. This prediction of COVID-19 shows that the government should ensure that most travelling agency should have better precautions and preparations in place before re-opening.","Ogundokun, Roseline O.; Lukman, Adewale F.; Kibria, Golam B.M.; Awotunde, Joseph B.; Aladeitan, Benedita B.",Infectious Disease Modelling,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idm.2020.08.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32835145/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468042720300336?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2468042720300336,597

A previous analysis was based on the assumption that the number of nasopharyngeal swabs would be constant. However, the number of daily swabs is now more than five times what it was when we did our previous analysis. Therefore, here we consider the time evolution of the ratio of the new daily cases to number of swabs, which is more representative of the evolution of the pandemic when the number of swabs is increasing or changing in time. We consider a number of possible distributions representing the evolution of the pandemic in Italy, and we test their prediction capability over a period of up to 6 weeks. The results show that a distribution of the type of Planck black body radiation law provides very good forecasting. The use of different distributions provides an independent possible estimate of the uncertainty. We then consider five possible trajectories for the number of daily swabs and we estimate the potential dates of a substantial reduction in the number of new daily cases. We then estimate the spread in a substantial reduction, below a certain threshold, of the daily cases per swab among the Italian regions. We finally perform a Monte Carlo simulation with 25,000 runs to evaluate a random uncertainty in the prediction of the date of a substantial reduction in the number of diagnosed daily cases per swab.","Ciufolini, Ignazio; Paolozzi, Antonio",Eur Phys J Plus,https://doi.org/10.1140/epjp/s13360-020-00488-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32562477/,597

We report performance parameters of a SARS-CoV‑2 screening program established for cancer outpatients at our center. METHODS: Institutional policy recommended routine biweekly SARS-CoV‑2 testing. Adherence to the testing recommendation during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic between 1 October and 30 November 2020 was analyzed. The SARS-CoV‑2 infection rate during first wave period (21 March to 4 May 2020) was compared to the one during second wave. RESULTS: A total of 1577 cancer patients were seen at our outpatient clinic during the second wave. In 1079/1577 (68.4%) patients, at least 1 SARS-CoV2 test was performed. Overall 2833 tests were performed, 23/1577 (1.5%, 95% confidence interval, CI 1.0–2.2%) patients were tested positive for SARS-CoV‑2, which indicates a significant increase compared to the first wave (4/1016; 0.4%, 95% CI 0.1–1.0%) with an odds ratio of 3.9 (95% CI 1.5–10.1; p < 0.005). Patients undergoing active anticancer treatment (172/960; 17.9% not tested) were more likely to have undergone a SARS-CoV‑2 test than patients in follow-up or best supportive care (326/617; 52.8% not tested p < 0.001). Furthermore, patients with only 1 visit within 4 weeks were more likely to not have undergone a SARS-CoV‑2 test (386/598; 64.5%) compared to patients with 2 or more visits (112/979; 11.4%; p < 0.001). The projected number of patients with undetected SARS-CoV‑2 infection during the study period was 5. CONCLUSION: We identified clinical patient parameters influencing SARS-CoV‑2 testing coverage in cancer outpatients. Our data can provide information on generation of standard operating procedures and resource allocation during subsequent infection waves.","Berger, Julia M.; Gansterer, Margaretha; Trutschnig, Wolfgang; Bathke, Arne C.; Strassl, Robert; Lamm, Wolfgang; Raderer, Markus; Preusser, Matthias; Berghoff, Anna S.",Wien Klin Wochenschr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34410467/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00508-021-01927-7,597

The gold standard method for SARS-CoV-2 detection requires both reverse transcription (RT) of the virus RNA to cDNA and then polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the cDNA amplification, which involves multiple enzymes, multiple reactions and a complicated assay optimization process. Here, we developed a duplex-specific nuclease (DSN)-based signal amplification method for SARS-CoV-2 detection directly from the virus RNA utilizing two specific DNA probes. These specific DNA probes can hybridize to the target RNA at different locations in the nucleocapsid protein gene (N gene) of SARS-CoV-2 to form a DNA/RNA heteroduplex. DSN cleaves the DNA probe to release fluorescence, while leaving the RNA strand intact to be bound to another available probe molecule for further cleavage and fluorescent signal amplification. The optimized DSN amount, incubation temperature and incubation time were investigated in this work. Proof-of-principle SARS-CoV-2 detection was demonstrated with a detection sensitivity of 500 pM virus RNA. This simple, rapid, and direct RNA detection method is expected to provide a complementary method for the detection of viruses mutated at the PCR primer-binding regions for a more precise detection.","Liu, Meiqing; Li, Haoran; Jia, Yanwei; Mak, Pui-In; Martins, Rui P.",Micromachines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33672890/; https://doi.org/10.3390/mi12020197,597

607694,Scientific Understanding of COVID-19: The First Step to Vanquishing the Current Pandemic,2021-06-30,"Growth and differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) belongs to the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily of proteins. Glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family receptor α-like (GFRAL) is an endogenous receptor for GDF15 detected selectively in the brain. GDF15 is not normally expressed in the tissue but is prominently induced by “injury”. Serum levels of GDF15 are also increased by aging and in response to cellular stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. It acts as an inflammatory marker and plays a role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases, metabolic disorders, and neurodegenerative processes. Identified as a new heart-derived endocrine hormone that regulates body growth, GDF15 has a local cardioprotective role, presumably due to its autocrine/paracrine properties: antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic. GDF15 expression is highly induced in cardiomyocytes after ischemia/reperfusion and in the heart within hours after myocardial infarction (MI). Recent studies show associations between GDF15, inflammation, and cardiac fibrosis during heart failure and MI. However, the reason for this increase in GDF15 production has not been clearly identified. Experimental and clinical studies support the potential use of GDF15 as a novel therapeutic target (1) by modulating metabolic activity and (2) promoting an adaptive angiogenesis and cardiac regenerative process during cardiovascular diseases. In this review, we comment on new aspects of the biology of GDF15 as a cardiac hormone and show that GDF15 may be a predictive biomarker of adverse cardiac events.","Rochette, Luc; Dogon, Geoffrey; Zeller, Marianne; Cottin, Yves; Vergely, Catherine",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34445593/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22168889,597

The government of Nepal issued a lockdown order in the Kathmandu Valley for 80 days from 24 March to 11 June 2020. This paper reports associated changes in ambient PM(2.5) measured at fixed-site monitors and changes in personal exposure to PM(2.5) monitored by APT Minima by four American diplomats who completed monitoring before and during lockdown (24 h for each period per person, 192 person-hours in total). Time activities and use of home air pollution mitigation measures (use of room air cleaners (RACs), sealing of homes) were recorded by standardized diary. We compared PM(2.5) exposure level by microenvironment (home (cooking), home (other activities), at work, commuting, other outdoor environment) in terms of averaged PM(2.5) concentration and the contribution to cumulative personal exposure (the product of PM(2.5) concentration and time spent in each microenvironment). Ambient PM(2.5) measured at fixed-sites in the US Embassy and in Phora Durbar were 38.2% and 46.7% lower than during the corresponding period in 2017–2019. The mean concentration of PM(2.5) to which US diplomats were exposed was very much lower than the concentrations of ambient levels measured at fixed site monitors in the city both before and during lockdown. Within-person comparisons suggest personal PM(2.5) exposure was 50.0% to 76.7% lower during lockdown than before it. Time spent outdoors and cooking at home were large contributors to cumulative personal exposure. Low indoor levels of PM(2.5) were achieved at work and home through use of RACs and measures to seal homes against the ingress of polluted air from outside. Our observations indicate the potential reduction in exposure to PM(2.5) with large-scale changes to mainly fossil-fuel related emissions sources and through control of indoor environments and activity patterns.","Edwards, Leslie; Rutter, Gemma; Iverson, Leslie; Wilson, Laura; Chadha, Tandeep S.; Wilkinson, Paul; Milojevic, Ai",Sci Total Environ,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.144836; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720383698; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33770893/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720383698,597

Those factors' relevance and their impact on sexual function in this population have not yet been established. AIM: To evaluate the impact of the pandemic on sexual function in healthcare professionals and medical students at a reference center in the treatment of COVID-19 in Brazil. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis with online questionnaires about sexual function was sent to health professionals and medical students from the HC-FMUSP medical complex. The questionnaire evaluated Total Sexual and Masturbatory Frequency prior and during the pandemic, libido and sexual satisfaction changes with a detailed inquire about demographics and personal factors. An objective assessment of sexual function was also made using the validated sexual quotient questionnaires. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Differences in intercourse frequency, libido, and overall sexual satisfaction, in a sample of healthcare professionals particularly vulnerable to the pandemic effects. RESULTS: A total of 1,314 responses were available with a mean age of 37 years. Worsening of sexual satisfaction was reported by 44.5% of the participants, with the following associated factors: Lower libido, missing Nightlife, Higher Masturbatory Frequency, and isolation from the partner. Remaning sexualy actively and having higher sexual frequency appear to decrease the chance of worsening sexual function. Worsening of Libido was reported by 37% and had several associated factors, including missing of Nightlife, older age, isolation from the partner among others. Being male and sexually active was associated with a smaller chance of reporting lower libido. CONCLUSION: We were able to observe a sharp drop in Libido and General Sexual Satisfaction. Although an increase in pornography consumption and masturbatory frequency did occur, these factors were not associated with greater sexual satisfaction. The impact of COVID-19 on this population's sexual health is not to be underestimated and should be further studied in the follow-up of the pandemic.

METHODS: We performed routine laboratory tests suitable to identify tissue damage and inflammatory status in 123 consecutive CoVID-19 patients admitted to the Emergency Department of the hospital of Piacenza (Emilia-Romagna, Northern Italy). The results were correlated with patients’ respiratory function evaluated by the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (PaO2/FiO2). Results: The most common laboratory abnormalities were lymphocytopenia and elevated values of C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) were also increased. The respiratory performance (PaO2/FiO2) showed a strong inverse correlation with LDH (r= 0.62, r(2) 0.38, p value< 0.0001) and CRP (r= 0.55, r(2) 0.31, p value< 0.0001). PaO2/FiO2 values also showed a significant inverse correlation with age (r= -0.37, p< 0.0001), AST (r= -0.31, p<0.01), WBC (r= -0.49, p<0.0001), neutrophils count (r= -0.5, p<0.001). ROC curves showed a sensitivity of 75% and specificity of 70% for the LDH cut-off value of 450 U/L and a sensitivity of 72% and specificity of 71% for the CRP cut-off value of 11 mg/dl in identifying CoVID-19 with moderate-severe ARDS. CONCLUSIONS: LDH and CRP may be related to respiratory function (PaO2/FiO2) and be a predictor of respiratory failure in CoVID-19 patients. LDH and CRP should be considered a useful test for the early identification of patients who require closer respiratory monitoring and more aggressive supportive therapies to avoid poor prognosis.","Erika, Poggiali; Domenica, Zaino; Paolo, Immovilli; Luca, Rovero; Giulia, Losi; Alessandro, Dacrema; Marzia, Nuccetelli; Giovanni Battista, Vadacca; Donata, Guidetti; Andrea, Vercelli; Andrea, Magnacavallo; Sergio, Bernardini; Chiara, Terracciano",Clin Chim Acta,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S000989812030276X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32531257/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2020.06.012; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000989812030276X?v=s5,597

611895,Relationship between hand hygiene and cutaneous findings during COVID19 pandemic,2020-08-05,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the applicability of modified early warning (MEWS) Score for prediction of hospital outcomes of medical emergency patients. DESIGN: Prospective hospital based observational study. SETTING: A tertiary care level medicine emergency unit in a medical college of North India. STUDY POPULATION: 300 Patients admitted in medicine emergency. METHOD: Patients of both sexes of age more than 18 years who were admitted in medical emergency unit at MMIMSR, Ambala were evaluated. Patients who were in cardiac arrest at arrival and those who died within the first 24 hours were excluded and 300 patients were included. Modified Early Warning Score based on physiological parameters was recorded at admission for each patient and monitored over the next 24 hours in the emergency unit. Hospital outcome of the patient in terms of mortality, need for critical care, prolonged stay and uneventful discharge were recorded and correlated with MEWS scores over the first 24 hours in the emergency unit. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves was generated to evaluate the utility of MEWS as a tool to predict patient outcome in medical emergency setting. RESULT: Of the 300 patients studied, the mean age of patients was 49 years, and the majority of the patients were male (61%). A MEWS Score of >5 at 24 hours of admission was associated significantly with in-hospital mortality of patients (p < 0.0001). The ROC (Receiver Operator Characteristic) curve revealed that in those patients who had a 24 hours MEWS >/= 5, the area under curve was (AUC) = 0.9. (95% CI: 0.95-0.98). Thus, MEWS was an effective predictor of in hospital mortality with sensitivity (78%) and specificity (94%). CONCLUSION: MEWS, a scoring system based on easily recordable physiological parameters can be used as an effective tool to triage and monitor patients in medical emergency units, to identify patients who are at greater risk of clinical deterioration and need close monitoring or early transfer for critical care or other timely interventions. Thus, application of MEWS in medical emergency units can be a useful tool to improve patient care, ensure optimal utilization of resources and prevent inappropriate discharge or neglect of sick patients.","Bhatnagar, Mini; Sirohi, Nikita; Dubey, Aruna Bhagat",J Family Med Prim Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34017725/; https://doi.org/10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_1426_20,597

612320,Lessons from Lockdown: Virtual Clinics and Service Reorganisation in Fracture Management During COVID 19 Experience of an Irish Regional Trauma Unit,2021-03-04,"Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) is an emerging and re‐emerging epizootic virus of swine that causes substantial economic losses to the pig industry in China and other countries. The variations in the virus, and its co‐infections with other enteric viruses, have contributed to the poor control of PEDV infection. In the current study, a broad epidemiological investigation of PEDV was carried out in 22 provinces or municipalities of China during 2015–2018. The enteric viruses causing co‐infection with PEDV and the genetic diversity of the PEDV S1 gene were also analysed. The results indicated that, of the 543 diarrhoea samples, 66.85% (363/543) were positive for PEDV, and co‐infection rates of PEDV with 13 enteric viruses ranged from 3.58% (13/363) to 81.55% (296/363). Among these enteric viruses, the signs of diarrhoea induced by PEDV were potentially associated with co‐infections with porcine enterovirus 9/10 (PEV) and torque teno sus virus 2 (TTSuV‐2) (p < .05). The 147 PEDV strains identified in our study belong to Chinese pandemic strains and exhibited genetic diversity. The virulence‐determining S1 proteins of PEDV pandemic strains were undergoing amino acid mutations, in which S58_S58insQGVN–N135dup–D158_I159del‐like mutations were common patterns (97.28%, 143/147). When compared with 2011–2014 PEDV strains, the amino acid mutations of PEDV pandemic strains were mainly located in the N‐terminal domain of S1 (S1‐NTD), and 21 novel mutations occurred in 2017 and 2018. Furthermore, protein homology modelling showed that the mutations in pattern of insertion and deletion mutations of the S1 protein of PEDV pandemic strains may have caused structural changes on the surface of the S1 protein. These data provide a better understanding of the co‐infection and genetic evolution of PEDV in China.","Su, Mingjun; Li, Chunqiu; Qi, Shanshan; Yang, Dan; Jiang, Ning; Yin, Baishuang; Guo, Donghua; Kong, Fanzhi; Yuan, Dongwei; Feng, Li; Sun, Dongbo",Transbound Emerg Dis,https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13439; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31785090/,597

We investigated the tolerance, variability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of QX003S biosimilar in healthy Chinese male subjects. DESIGN: A randomised, double-blind, two-arm, parallel study was performed to examine the bioequivalence of QX003S (8 mg/kg) with that of Actemra® as a reference drug. RESULTS: QX003S (N = 40) and Actemra® (N = 40) groups exhibited similar PK properties. The inter-subject variability ranged from 14.95% to 18.78%. The 90% confidence intervals of the ratios for C(max), AUC(0–t) andAUC(0–∞) in both groups were within the range of 80–125%. After administration, the number of subjects who tested positive for anti-drug antibodies (ADA) in the QX003S group and Actemra® groups was 6 (14.3%) and 14 (34.1%), respectively. Adverse reactions occurred in 100% and 97.6% subjects in the QX003S and Actemra® groups, respectively. The most common adverse reactions were decrease in fibrinogen level and neutrophil and leukocyte counts. CONCLUSION: The PK characteristics and immunogenicity exhibited by QX003S were similar to that of the reference product, Actemra®.

This study aimed to assess the efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) in non-severe patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective study based on propensity score matching (PSM) was designed. Primary outcomes included severity rate and mortality. Secondary outcomes included the duration of fever, virus clearance time, length of hospital stays, and use of antibiotics. RESULTS: 639 non-severe patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. 45 patients received IVIg therapy and 594 received non-IVIg therapy. After PSM (1:2 ration), the baseline characteristics were well balanced between IVIg (n = 45) and control group (n = 90). No statistically significant differences were found between IVIg group and control group in the duration of fever (median, 3 vs 3 days, p = 0.667), virus clearance time (median, 11 vs 10 days, p = 0.288), length of hospital stay (median, 14 vs 13 days, p = 0.469), and the use of antibiotics (40% vs 38.9%, p = 0.901). Meanwhile, compared to IVIg group, no more patients progressed to severe cases (3.3% vs 6.6%, p = 0.376) and died (0 vs 2.2%, p = 0.156) in control group.

As of June 04, 2020, more than 2 lakh cases have been confirmed with a death rate of 2.81%. It has been noticed that, out of each 1000 tests, 53 result positively infected. In order to investigate the impact of weather conditions on daily transmission occurring in India, daily data of Maximum (TMax), Minimum (TMin), Mean (TMean) and Dew Point Temperature (TDew), Diurnal Temperature range (TRange), Average Relative Humidity, Range in Relative Humidity, and Wind Speed (WS) over 9 most affected cities are analysed in several time frames: weather of that day, 7, 10, 12, 14, 16 days before transmission. Spearman rank correlation (r) shows significant but low correlation with most of the weather parameters, however, comparatively better association exists on 14 days lag. Diurnal range in Temperature and Relative Humidity shows non-significant correlation. Analysis shows, COVID-19 cases likely to be increased with increasing air temperature, however role of humidity is not clear. Among weather parameters, Minimum Temperature was relatively better correlate than other. 80% of the total confirmed cases were registered when TMax, TMean, TMin, TRange, TDew, and WS on 12-16 days ago vary within a range of 33.6-41.3 deg C, 29.8-36.5 deg C, 24.8-30.4 deg C, 7.5-15.2 deg C, 18.7-23.6 deg C, and 4.2-5.75 m/s respectively, hence, it gives an idea of susceptible weather conditions for such transmission in India. Using Support Vector Machine based regression, the daily cases are profoundly estimated with more than 80% accuracy, which indicate that coronavirus transmission cannot be well linearly correlated with any single weather parameters, rather multivariate non-linear approach must be employed. Accounting lag of 12-16 days, the association found to be excellent, thus depict that there is an incubation period of 12-16 days for coronavirus transmission in Indian scenario.","Gupta, A.; Pradhan, B.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.15.20131490; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.15.20131490v1?rss=1,597

Harnessing national scale data from the COVID-19 pandemic may better inform policy makers in decision making surrounding the reopening of society. We examined country-level, daily-confirmed, COVID-19 case data from the World Health Organization (WHO) to better understand the comparative dynamics associated with the ongoing global pandemic at a national scale. Study design Observational study. Methods We included data from 20 countries in Europe, the Americas, Africa, Eastern Mediterranean and West Pacific regions, and obtained the aggregated daily new case data for the European Union including 27 countries. We utilized an innovative analytic approach by applying statistical change point models, which have been previously employed to model volatility in stock markets, changes in genomic data, and data dynamics in other scientific disciplines, to segment the transformed case data. This allowed us to identify possible change or turning points as indicated by the dynamics of daily COVID-19 incidences. We also employed B-spline regression models to express the estimated (predicted) trend of daily new incidences for each country’s COVID-19 disease burden with the identified key change points in the model. Results We identified subtle, yet different change points (translated to actual calendar days) by either the mean and variance change point model with small p-values or by a Bayesian online change point algorithm with large posterior probability in the trend of COVID-19 incidences for different countries. We correlated these statistically identified change points with evidence from the literature surrounding these countries’ policies regarding opening and closing of their societies in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19. The days when change points were detected were ahead of the actual policy implementation days, and in most of the countries included in this study the decision lagged the change point days too long to prevent potential widespread extension of the pandemic. Conclusions Our models describe the behavior of COVID-19 prevalence at a national scale and identify changes in national disease burden as relating to chronological changes in restrictive societal activity. Globally, social distancing measures may have been most effective in smaller countries with single governmental and public health organizational structures. Further research examining the impact of heterogeneous governmental responses to pandemic management appears warranted.","Coughlin, Steven S.; Yiǧiter, Ayten; Xu, Honyan; Berman, Adam E.; Chen, Jie",Public health in practice,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S266653522030063X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33969330/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhip.2020.100064; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266653522030063X?v=s5,597

Feces or nasal swab fluids were incubated sequentially with hyperimmune bovine anti-bovine coronavirus serum and protein A-gold, negatively stained, applied to formvar-coated copper grids and viewed using an electron microscope. The PAG-IEM method specifically identified BCV particles and possible subviral particles in feces and nasal-swab fluids from infected calves. The PAG-IEM method did not label other enveloped enteric viruses or morphologically similar fringed particles commonly found in feces. Detection of BCV using PAG-IEM was compared with ELISA and direct immunofluorescence (IF) of nasal epithelial cells by monitoring fecal and respiratory tract shedding of BCV from two experimentally infected and two naturally infected calves from birth to 3 weeks of age. PAG-IEM and ELISA detected shedding of BCV in fecal ( 4 4 animals) and nasal ( 3 4 animals) samples for an average of 5.25 days each. The observed agreement of BCV detection by PAG-IEM and ELISA was 85%. PAG-IEM may be a more sensitive immunoassay for the detection of BCV in diagnostic specimens from infected neonatal calves than ELISA. BCV infection of nasal epithelial cells was detected by immunofluorescence in 4 4 calves, persisted for the duration of the study in 2 4 calves and was sporadic in the other two animals.

To assess the effects of COVID-19 on the outdoor recreation participation and subjective well-being of adolescents, as well as how participation in outdoor activities may mitigate declines in subjective well-being, we used a Qualtrics XM panel to conduct a nationally representative survey of youth ages 10–18 across the United States (n = 624) between 30 April and 15 June 2020. Survey questions focused on frequency of participation in outdoor activities before and during the pandemic, as well as changes in subjective well-being. Paired t-tests revealed decreases in both outdoor recreation participation (64% reported declines) and subjective well-being (52% reported declines). A regression model examining correlates of changes in subjective well-being (R(2) = 0.42) revealed strong associations with changes in outdoor play (B = 0.44, p < 0.001) and nature-based (B = 0.21, p = 0.016) activities. Adolescents’ from all backgrounds who participated in these activities during the pandemic reported smaller declines in subjective well-being.

AIMS: To describe the clinical outcomes and the fulfilment of the treatment schedule of patients with IBD treated with biological agents in a single-center of a red-zone of the pandemic, and to report the patients’ perceptions about COVID-19 and the measures adopted at our center. METHODS: Therapeutic adherence and clinical outcomes were collected for all patients undergoing treatment with intravenous biologicals and subcutaneous biologicals at our center. A telephone survey was also performed to assess these patients’ perceptions of the COVID pandemic and the related measures adopted at their IBD unit. RESULTS: A total of 234 patients were included (117 on intravenous and 117 on subcutaneous biologicals). Only 10% of patients postponed intravenous infusions intentionally and 5% postponed the collection of subcutaneous biologicals at the hospital pharmacy. Only five confirmed COVID-19 cases were registered (2.1%), all of them of mild severity. One hundred and fifty-five patients participated in the survey (77 on intravenous and 78 on subcutaneous drugs). Fear of going to the hospital was the most common reason for postponing biological administrations. Among those on combination therapy, only 7% admitted to have withdrawn immunosuppressants. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to intravenous and subcutaneous biological therapies during the pandemic was high in a single-center cohort of IBD patients even though the cumulative incidence of confirmed COVID-19 was low.","Iborra, Ignacio; Puig, Maria; Marín, Laura; Calafat, Margalida; Cañete, Fiorella; Quiñones, Carles; González-González, Laura; Cardona, Glòria; Mañosa, Míriam; Domènech, Eugeni",Dig Dis Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33469807/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10620-020-06807-0,597

615507,COVID-19: How the Quarantine could lead to the Depreobesity,2020-05-15,"The COVID-19 virus has become a fearful epidemic for people all over the world. In Turkey, long quarantine periods and curfews have increased both physical and psychological problems. Due to the rapid spread and substantial impact of the COVID-19 virus, different psychological effects were observed among different segments of society, such as among young people, elderly people, and active workers. Because of fear caused by the COVID-19 virus, it is thought that depression, stress, and anxiety levels have increased. It is estimated that there are more psychological issues for people with poor health and others whose friends or family became ill or have died because of COVID-19. To explore and test the situation mentioned above, we conducted a cross-sectional study in Turkey with 3287 participants above 16 years old. We measured COVID-19 fear, along with anxiety, stress, and depression levels (DASS21) and demographics. Firstly, we tested whether COVID-19 fear predicts stress, anxiety, and depression. Secondly, we investigated if the effect of COVID-19 fear is stronger for those who have underlying illness and for those whose friends or family became ill or have died because of COVID-19. The results showed that women and 16–25 years old youths have higher COVID-19-related fear, anxiety, depression, and stress. Furthermore, we found a significant relationship between COVID-19 fear and stress, anxiety, and depression, as well as significant moderation effects of having an underlying illness and having friends or family who were infected or have died.

The Incredible Years® (IY) Parent Program is a group intervention that has demonstrated efficacy in terms of reducing stress in parents, as well as improving behavioral, emotional, and social outcomes in children. The program has been recently adapted for families of children with autism or language delays (IY-ASLD®). This intervention has not yet been implemented in the Spanish Public Health System, where there is a scarcity of evidence-based interventions being offered to families with young children presenting neurodevelopmental problems. The main aims of this study are to determine the feasibility of implementing the IY-ASLD® program within Spanish Child Mental Health Services and to examine parents’ acceptability and satisfaction with the intervention. As a secondary objective, we aim to evaluate its preliminary effectiveness in terms of reducing parental stress and behavioral difficulties in their children. The FIRST STEPS study is a multicenter, pilot randomized controlled trial comparing the IY-ASLD® program with a treatment-as-usual (TAU) condition. Approximately 70 families of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and preterm children with communication and/or socialization difficulties (aged 2–5 years) will be recruited. Families will be assessed prior to randomization and after the intervention. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the intervention will consist of 22 weekly online sessions (approximately 6 months). The FIRST STEPS pilot trial will demonstrate the feasibility and acceptability of reliably implementing the IY-ASLD® program within the Spanish Public Health System.

This study applies analytical tools from organisational science to understand how evidence produced by infectious disease epidemiologists and health economists is used by global health organisations. A conceptual framework that embraces evidence use typologies and relates findings to the organisational process of action generation informs and structures the research. Between March and September 2020, we conducted in-depth interviews with mathematical modellers (evidence producers) and employees at global health organisations, who are involved in decision-making processes (evidence consumers). We found that commissioned epidemiological and economic evidence is used to track progress and provides a measure of success, both in terms of health outcomes and the organisations’ mission. Global health organisations predominantly use this evidence to demonstrate accountability and solicit funding from external partners. We find common understanding and awareness across consumers and producers about the purposes and uses of these commissioned pieces of work and how they are distinct from more academic explorative research outputs. Conceptual evidence use best describes this process. Evidence is slowly integrated into organisational processes and is one of many influences on global health organisations’ actions. Relationships developed over time and trust guide the process, which may lead to quite a concentrated cluster of those producing and commissioning models. These findings raise several insights relevant to the literature of research utilisation in organisations and evidence-based management. The study extends our understanding of how evidence is used and which organisational actions are generated as a result of commissioning epidemiological and economic evidence.","Christen, Paula; Conteh, Lesong",BMJ Glob Health,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2021-006827; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34489331/,597

We screened longitudinally-sampled convalescent human donors against SARS-CoV-2 tetramers and identified a participant with an immunodominant response against residues 322 to 311 of nucleocapsid (Nuc322-331), a peptide conserved in all variants of concern reported to date. We conducted 38-parameter cytometry by time of flight on tetramer-identified Nuc322-331-specific CD8+ T cells and on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells recognizing the entire nucleocapsid and spike proteins, and took 32 serological measurements. We discovered a coordination of the Nuc322-331-specific CD8+ T response with both the CD4+ T cell and Ab pillars of adaptive immunity. Over the approximately six month period of convalescence monitored, we observed a slow and progressive decrease in the activation state and polyfunctionality of Nuc322-331-specific CD8+ T cells, accompanied by an increase in their lymph node-homing and homeostatic proliferation potential. These results suggest that following a typical case of mild COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells not only persist but continuously differentiate in a coordinated fashion well into convalescence into a state characteristic of long-lived, self-renewing memory.","Ma, Tongcui; Ryu, Heeju; McGregor, Matthew; Babcock, Benjamin; Neidleman, Jason; Xie, Guorui; George, Ashley F; Frouard, Julie; Murray, Victoria; Gill, Gurjot; Ghosn, Eliver; Newell, Evan W; Lee, Sulggi A; Roan, Nadia R",Journal of immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34389625/; https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.2100465,597

Adipose tissue-related chronic inflammation could be a promoter for the occurrence of the cytokine storm that predicts aggravation of COVID-19. The primary aim was to investigate if this increased risk for more severe COVID-19 was associated with a higher inflammatory response. METHODS: We enrolled patients <75 years old hospitalized in a medical COVID-19 ward with SARS-CoV-2-related pneumonia. Patients were classified according to BMI as normal weight, overweight, and obesity. Laboratory parameters were measured at admission and every second day during the hospital stay. RESULTS: Ninety patients (64.4% males; median age 61 years) were enrolled. Invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) was needed in 9% of the patients with normal weight, in 32.4% of the patients with overweight, and in 12.9% of the patients with obesity (p = 0.045). Maximal C-reactive protein (CRP) level during hospital stay was 92 (48–122) mg/L in patients with normal weight, 140 (82–265) mg/L in patients with overweight, and 117 (67–160) mg/L in patients with obesity (p = 0.037). Maximal ferritin values were 564 (403–1,379) μg/L in patients with a normal weight, 1,253 (754–2,532) μg/L in patients with overweight, and 828 (279–1,582) μg/L in patients with obesity (p = 0.015). CONCLUSION: Patients with overweight and obesity required more IMV and had higher peaks of CRP and ferritin than patients with normal weight during COVID-19.","Bettini, Silvia; Bucca, Giovanni; Sensi, Caterina; Dal Prà, Chiara; Fabris, Roberto; Vettor, Roberto; Busetto, Luca",Obes Facts,https://doi.org/10.1159/000517851; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34482305/,597

The aim of this work was to analyze the role played by different blood biomarkers in predicting the appearance of headaches in healthcare workers wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) in a COVID-19 treatment unit. A prospective cohort study of 38 healthcare workers was performed during April 2020. Blood analysis, performed just before the start of a 4 hour shift, was carried out on all volunteers equipped with PPE. At the end of their shifts and after decontamination, they were asked if they had suffered from headache in order to obtain a binary outcome. The baseline creatinine value reflected a specific odds ratio of 241.36 (95% CI: 2.50–23,295.43; p = 0.019) and an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.737 (95%CI: 0.57–0.90; p < 0.01).

We report preliminary experience with the efficacy of an enclosure with augmented airflow to decrease the risk of exposure to aerosolized pathogens during airway management including endotracheal intubation. A particle generator was used to test the efficacy of the reduction of aerosolized particles by measuring their concentration within the enclosure and in the environment. No reductionin the concentration of aerosolized particles was noted with the enclosure flap open, whether the interior suction was on or off. However, with the enclosure closed and no augmented air flow (suction off), the particle concentration decreased to 1.2% of baseline. The concentration decreased even further, to 0.8% of baseline with the enclosure closed with augmented airflow (suction on). Aerosolized particulate contamination in the operating room can be decreased using a clear plastic enclosure with minimal openings and augmented airflow. This may serve to decrease the exposure of healthcare providers to aerosolized pathogens.","Bryant, Jason; Tobias, Joseph D.",Paediatr Anaesth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32464695/; https://doi.org/10.1111/pan.13934,597

Antiviral human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are promising candidates to prevent or treat severe viral diseases, but their long development timeframes limit their rapid deployment and use. Here, we report the development of an integrated sequence of technologies, including single-cell mRNA sequence analysis, bioinformatics, synthetic biology and high-throughput functional analysis, that enabled the rapid discovery of highly potent antiviral human mAbs, whose activity we validated in vivo. In a 78-day study modelling the deployment of a rapid response to an outbreak, we isolated more than 100 human mAbs specific for the Zika virus, assessed their function, identified 29 of those as having broadly neutralizing activity, and verified the therapeutic potency of the lead candidates in mice and non-human primate models of infection via the delivery of an antibody-encoding mRNA formulation and of the respective IgG antibody.

617311,"Ageusia, a highly specific symptom of COVID‐19, for which an unaware patient may seek dental assistance",2020-09-22,"Recent studies of dynamic properties in complex systems point out the profound impact of hidden geometry features known as simplicial complexes, which enable geometrically conditioned many-body interactions. Studies of collective behaviours on the controlled-structure complexes can reveal the subtle interplay of geometry and dynamics. Here, we investigate the phase synchronisation dynamics under the competing interactions embedded on 1-simplex (edges) and 2-simplex (triangles) faces of a homogeneous 4-dimensional simplicial complex. Its underlying network is a 1-hyperbolic graph with the assortative correlations among the node's degrees and the spectral dimension that exceeds $d_s=4$. We determine the time-averaged system's order parameter to characterise the synchronisation level. In the absence of higher interactions, the complete synchrony is continuously reached with the increasing positive pairwise interactions ($K_1>0$), and a partial synchronisation for the negative couplings ($K_1<0$) with no apparent hysteresis. Similar behaviour occurs in the degree-preserved randomised network. In contrast, the synchronisation is absent for the negative pairwise coupling in the entirely random graph and simple scale-free networks. Increasing the strength $K_2\neq 0$ of the triangle-based interactions gradually hinders the synchronisation promoted by pairwise couplings, and the non-symmetric hysteresis loop opens with an abrupt desynchronisation transition towards the $K_1<0$ branch. However, for substantial triangle-based interactions, the frustration effects prevail, preventing the complete synchronisation, and the abrupt transition disappears. These findings shed new light on the mechanisms by which the high-dimensional simplicial complexes in natural systems, such as human connectomes, can modulate their native synchronisation processes.","Chutani, Malayaja; Tadic, Bosiljka; Gupte, Neelima",Physical review.

BCoV belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus, which is a model of a pathogen that is threatening human health and includes severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. This study aimed to determine whether photocatalytic material effectively reduces CoVs in the environment. Using the film adhesion method of photocatalytic materials, we assessed its antiviral activity and the effect of visible light irradiation according to methods defined by the International Organization for Standardization. Consequently, photocatalytic material was found to have antiviral activity, reducing the viral loads by 2.7 log TCID(50) (tissue culture infective dose 50)/0.1 mL (500 lux), 2.8 log TCID(50)/0.1 mL (1000 lux), and 2.4 log TCID(50)/0.1 mL (3000 lux). Hence, this photocatalytic material might be applicable not only to reducing CoVs in the cattle breeding environment but also perhaps in other indoor spaces, such as offices and hospital rooms.

617768,Working in the dark: Interaction with a sub clinical COVID-19 subject and lessons learned,2020-06-02,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a significant increase in the use of non-contact infrared devices for screening the body temperatures of people at the entrances of hospitals, airports, train stations, churches, schools, shops, sports centres, offices, and public places in general. The strong correlation between a high body temperature and SARS-CoV-2 infection has motivated the governments of several countries to restrict access to public indoor places simply based on a person’s body temperature. Negating/allowing entrance to a public place can have a strong impact on people. For example, a cancer patient could be refused access to a cancer centre because of an incorrect high temperature measurement. On the other hand, underestimating an individual’s body temperature may allow infected patients to enter indoor public places where it is much easier for the virus to spread to other people. Accordingly, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the reliability of body temperature measurements has become fundamental. In particular, a debated issue is the reliability of remote temperature measurements, especially when these are aimed at identifying in a quick and reliable way infected subjects. Working distance, body–device angle, and light conditions and many other metrological and subjective issues significantly affect the data acquired via common contactless infrared point thermometers, making the acquisition of reliable measurements at the entrance to public places a challenging task. The main objective of this work is to sensitize the community to the typical incorrect uses of infrared point thermometers, as well as the resulting drifts in measurements of body temperature. Using several commercial contactless infrared point thermometers, we performed four different experiments to simulate common scenarios in a triage emergency room. In the first experiment, we acquired several measurements for each thermometer without measuring the working distance or angle of inclination to show that, for some instruments, the values obtained can differ by 1 °C. In the second and third experiments, we analysed the impacts of the working distance and angle of inclination of the thermometers, respectively, to prove that only a few cm/degrees can cause drifts higher than 1 °C. Finally, in the fourth experiment, we showed that the light in the environment can also cause changes in temperature up to 0.5 °C. Ultimately, in this study, we quantitatively demonstrated that the working distance, angle of inclination, and light conditions can strongly impact temperature measurements, which could invalidate the screening results.","Piccinini, Filippo; Martinelli, Giovanni; Carbonaro, Antonella",Sensors (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/s21113794; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34070896/,597

Methods We have studied a good number of research papers on Artificial Intelligence on cardiology during the COVID-19 pandemic to identify its significant benefits, applications, and future scope. AI uses artificial neuronal networks (ANN) to predict. In cardiology, it is used to predict the survival of a COVID-19 patient from heart failure. Results AI involves complex algorithms for predicting somewhat successful diagnosis and treatments. This technology uses different techniques, such as cognitive computing, deep learning, and machine learning. It is incorporated to make a decision and resolve complex challenges. It can focus on a large number of diseases, their causes, interactions, and prevention during the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper introduces AI-based care and studies its need in the field of cardiology. Finally, eleven major applications of AI in cardiology during the COVID-19 pandemic are identified and discussed. Conclusions Cardiovascular diseases are one of the major causes of death in human beings, and it is increasing for the last few years. Cardiology patients' treatment is expensive, so this technology is introduced to provide a new pathway and visualise cardiac anomalies.

It is necessary to develop a sampling and analytical method for virus-laden bioaerosol that could be considered reliable and validated according to ISO/IEC 17025 requirements. The present paper defines sample pretreatments aiming at recover SARS-CoV-2 from glass-fiber and PTFE filters employed by low and high-volume air samplers. Recovery test results focused on the sample concentration step carried out by means of ultracentrifugation are reported as well. Human coronavirus strain OC43 (a surrogate β-coronavirus with the same SARS-CoV-2 particle structure) was used to validate each step of the recovery tests. We found that the elution efficiency of coronavirus OC43 from glass-fiber and quartz filters could be strongly enhanced by using an elution buffer containing up to 40% of fetal calf serum. Moreover, the recovery from PTFE filters is much higher and easier than from glass-fiber filters: for glass-fiber filters a 3 h-shaking phase, followed by a 30 s-vortexing step, are necessary to elute viral infective particles; for PTFE, 60 min-shaking is enough. The effect of suction time on filters could be resumed as follows: sampling durations up to 20 min at a flow rate of 500 L/min do not affect recovery efficiencies from 10 cm glass-fiber filters, whereas the recovery efficiency of infectious virions from 4.7 cm PTFE filters decreases of a factor 2 after 3 h of sampling at a flow rate of 20 L/min. The recovery efficiency of ultracentrifugation turns out to be around 57%. The effect of storage temperature of filters immersed in a transport medium on coronavirus infectivity is assessed as well. Based on the sampling techniques and the analytical methods developed as described in the present study, many field tests were carried out reporting virus concentrations up to 50 genomic copies per cubic meter of air in domestic environment with poor ventilation condition, whereas in hospital wards the detectable concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 were generally lower than 10 genomic copies per cubic meter of air.","Robotto, Angelo; Civra, Andrea; Quaglino, Paola; Polato, Denis; Brizio, Enrico; Lembo, David",Environ Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001393512101077X?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34324848/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.111783; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S001393512101077X,597

The disease first emerged in November 2002 in Guangdong Province, China and spread globally within months. The SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV) affects multiple organ systems with severe viral pneumonia as its main clinical manifestation but with diarrhea, lymphopenia, and mild liver dysfunction being common extra-pulmonary manifestations. Increasing age and the presence of underlying respiratory diseases worsens the prognosis. Unlike other respiratory viral infections, transmission of SARS was less frequent in the first 5 days of illness and correlated with low viral load in the upper respiratory tract at this stage of the illness. This fortuitous feature of the disease allowed the public health measures of case detection and patient isolation to interrupt virus transmission in the community and abort the SARS outbreak. Bats are a reservoir of a virus closely related to SARS CoV and this may be the likely precursor from which the human-adapted SARS CoV emerged. Small mammals such as ‘civet-cats’ (Paguma larvata) within live animal markets in southern China serve as amplifiers of infection and these markets were the likely interface where zoonotic transmission occurred. The viral spike protein is necessary and sufficient for inducing protective antibody responses and has been a key target in the development of candidate vaccines.","Peiris, J.S.M.; Poon, L.L.M.",Encyclopedia of Virology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123744104007809; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123744104007809,597

The resulting global water crisis causes millions of deaths and trillions of USD in economic damages annually. Semiarid regions have been disproportionately affected because of high relative water demand and pollution. Many proven water management strategies are not fully implemented, partially because of a lack of public engagement with freshwater ecosystems. In this context, we organized a large citizen science initiative to quantify nutrient status and cultivate connection in the semiarid watershed of Utah Lake (USA). Working with community members, we collected samples from ~200 locations throughout the 7,640 km(2) watershed on a single day in the spring, summer, and fall of 2018. We calculated ecohydrological metrics for nutrients, major ions, and carbon. For most solutes, concentration and leverage (influence on flux) were highest in lowland reaches draining directly to the lake, coincident with urban and agricultural sources. Solute sources were relatively persistent through time for most parameters despite substantial hydrological variation. Carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus species showed critical source area behavior, with 10–17% of the sites accounting for most of the flux. Unlike temperate watersheds, where spatial variability often decreases with watershed size, longitudinal variability showed an hourglass shape: high variability among headwaters, low variability in mid-order reaches, and high variability in tailwaters. This unexpected pattern was attributable to the distribution of human activity and hydrological complexity associated with return flows, losing river reaches, and diversions in the tailwaters. We conclude that participatory science has great potential to reveal ecohydrological patterns and rehabilitate individual and community relationships with local ecosystems. In this way, such projects represent an opportunity to both understand and improve water quality in diverse socioecological contexts.","Jones, Erin Fleming; Frei, Rebecca J.; Lee, Raymond M.; Maxwell, Jordan D.; Shoemaker, Rhetta; Follett, Andrew P.; Lawson, Gabriella M.; Malmfeldt, Madeleine; Watts, Rachel; Aanderud, Zachary T.; Allred, Carter; Asay, Allison Tuttle; Buhman, Madeline; Burbidge, Hunter; Call, Amber; Crandall, Trevor; Errigo, Isabella; Griffin, Natasha A.; Hansen, Neil C.; Howe, Jansen C.; Meadows, Emily L.; Kujanpaa, Elizabeth; Lange, Leslie; Nelson, Monterey L.; Norris, Adam J.; Ostlund, Elysse; Suiter, Nicholas J.; Tanner, Kaylee; Tolworthy, Joseph; Vargas, Maria Camila; Abbott, Benjamin W.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34411107/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255411,597

Importantly, none of the 451 tumors had a score of <2, and as such, the MOLES protocol would have indicated referral to an ocular oncologist for 100% of patients. Conclusion: The MOLES scoring system is a sensitive (99.8%) tool for indicating malignancy in melanocytic choroidal tumors (MOLES ≥ 3). If the examining practitioner can recognize the five features suggestive of malignancy, MOLES is a safe tool to optimize referral of melanocytic choroidal tumors for specialist care.","Roelofs, Kelsey A.; O’Day, Roderick; Al Harby, Lamis; Arora, Amit K.; Cohen, Victoria M.L.; Sagoo, Mandeep S.; Damato, Bertil",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32455720/; https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers12051311,597

We have also proposed a conceptual framework and practical suggestions for health‐care providers in tackling these challenges, which can also apply to the care of older people in general, with or without other neurological diseases, such as stroke or parkinsonism. We believe this review will provide strategic directions and set standards for health‐care leaders in dementia, including governmental bodies around the world in coordinating emergency response plans for protecting and caring for older people with dementia amid the COIVD‐19 outbreak, which is likely to continue at varying severity in different regions around the world in the medium term.","Mok, Vincent C.T.; Pendlebury, Sarah; Wong, Adrian; Alladi, Suvarna; Au, Lisa; Bath, Philip M; Biessels, Geert Jan; Chen, Christopher; Cordonnier, Charlotte; Dichgans, Martin; Dominguez, Jacqueline; Gorelick, Philip B.; Kim, SangYun; Kwok, Timothy; Greenberg, Steven M.; Jia, Jianping; Kalaria, Rajesh; Kivipelto, Miia; Naegandran, Kandiah; Lam, Linda C.W.; Lam, Bonnie Yin Ka; Lee, Allen T.C.; Markus, Hugh S.; O'Brien, John; Pai, Ming‐Chyi; Pantoni, Leonardo; Sachdev, Perminder; Skoog, Ingmar; Smith, Eric E.; Srikanth, Velandai; Suh, Guk‐Hee; Wardlaw, Joanna; Ko, Ho; Black, Sandra E.; Scheltens, Philip",Alzheimers Dement,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32789951/; https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.12143,597

619313,Relationship Between Odor Intensity Estimates and COVID-19 Prevalence Prediction in a Swedish Population,2020-05-22,"The world is amid a pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2. Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus causes serious respiratory tract infections that can lead to viral pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and death. Some patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have an activated coagulation system characterized by elevated plasma levels of d-dimer—a biomarker of fibrin degradation. Importantly, high levels of D-dimer on hospital admission are associated with increased risk of mortality. Venous thromboembolism is more common than arterial thromboembolism in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Pulmonary thrombosis and microvascular thrombosis are observed in autopsy studies, and this may contribute to the severe hypoxia observed in COVID-19 patients. It is likely that multiple systems contribute to thrombosis in COVID-19 patients, such as activation of coagulation, platelet activation, hypofibrinolysis, endothelial cell dysfunction, inflammation, neutrophil extracellular traps, and complement. Targeting these different pathways may reduce thrombosis and improve lung function in COVID-19 patients.","Mackman, Nigel; Antoniak, Silvio; Wolberg, Alisa S.; Kasthuri, Raj; Key, Nigel S.",Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32657623/; https://doi.org/10.1161/atvbaha.120.314514,597

Undetected bias induced by inappropriate use of datasets, and improper consideration of confounders prevents the translation of prediction models into clinical practice. By adopting established tools for model evaluation to the task of evaluating datasets, this study provides a systematic appraisal of publicly available COVID-19 chest X-ray datasets, determining their potential use and evaluating potential sources of bias. Only 9 out of more than a hundred identified datasets met at least the criteria for proper assessment of risk of bias and could be analysed in detail. Remarkably most of the datasets utilised in 201 papers published in peer-reviewed journals, are not among these 9 datasets, thus leading to models with high risk of bias. This raises concerns about the suitability of such models for clinical use.

The current Sars‐CoV‐2 coronavirus pandemic has led to massive restrictions in health care and social life worldwide. People with PWS represent a particularly vulnerable population group to these restrictions, with unknown impact on their mental health. METHODS: We conducted an online questionnaire to assess the impact of the restrictions associated with the COVID‐19 pandemic on the mental health of people with PWS. RESULTS: One hundred and eight caregivers completed the survey about individuals with PWS. Individuals with PWS > 6 years (n = 89) were included for evaluation with regard to psychopathological change. Respondents frequently reported an increase in psychopathological symptoms associated with PWS during the lockdown, with 51.7% reporting increased temper outbursts, 43.8% showing signs of sadness, 38.2% being anxious, 55.0% more irritable, and 39.3% showing more food seeking behaviour. Adjusted for the type of accommodation food seeking behaviour and irritability is increased to a significantly lesser extent in people with PWS accommodated in specialised care facilities compared with those living in their family home. No significant difference could be found between the sexes. CONCLUSION: The COVID‐19 pandemic has had a significant effect on the mental health of individuals with PWS, evidenced by an increase in behaviours associated with PWS, including temper outbursts, food‐seeking, and irritability, which again underlines their need for specialised care. Individuals living with their families were particularly vulnerable, indicating that they and their families are in special need of support.","Wieting, J.; Eberlein, C.; Bleich, S.; Frieling, H.; Deest, M.",J Intellect Disabil Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33754414/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jir.12831,597

A comprehensive, integrative autopsy series that advances the mechanistic discussion surrounding this disease process is still lacking. METHODS Autopsies were performed at the Mount Sinai Hospital on 67 COVID-19 positive patients and data from the clinical records were obtained from the Mount Sinai Data Warehouse. The experimental design included a comprehensive microscopic examination carried out by a team of expert pathologists, along with transmission electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, RNA in situ hybridization, as well as immunology and serology assays. RESULTS Laboratory results of our COVID-19 cohort show elevated inflammatory markers, abnormal coagulation values, and elevated cytokines IL-6, IL-8 and TNF. Autopsies revealed large pulmonary emboli in four cases. We report microthrombi in multiple organ systems including the brain, as well as conspicuous hemophagocytosis and a secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis-like syndrome in many of our patients. We provide electron microscopic, immunofluorescent and immunohistochemical evidence of the presence of the virus and the ACE2 receptor in our samples. CONCLUSIONS We report a comprehensive autopsy series of 67 COVID-19 positive patients revealing that this disease, so far conceptualized as a primarily respiratory viral illness, also causes endothelial dysfunction, a hypercoagulable state, and an imbalance of both the innate and adaptive immune responses. Novel findings reported here include an endothelial phenotype of ACE2 in selected organs, which correlates with clotting abnormalities and thrombotic microangiopathy, addressing the prominent coagulopathy and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Another original observation is that of macrophage activation syndrome, with hemophagocytosis and a hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis-like disorder, underlying the microangiopathy and excessive cytokine release.

Synthetically laborious and expensive to manufacture, NPAAs also can have poor coupling efficiencies allowing only a small fraction to be sampled by conventional SPPS. To gain general access to NPAA-containing peptides, we developed a first-generation platform that merges contemporary flavin photocatalysis with parallel synthesis to simultaneously make, purify, quantify, and even test up to 96 single-NPAA peptide variants via the unique combination of boronic acids and a dehydroalanine residue in a peptide.

However, the emergence of vaccine-resistant strains [3-6] may come too rapidly for current vaccine developments to alleviate the health, economic and social consequences of the pandemic [7,8]. To quantify and characterize the risk of such a scenario, we created a SIR-derived model [9,10] with initial stochastic dynamics of the vaccine-resistant strain to study the probability of its emergence and establishment. Using parameters realistically resembling SARS-CoV-2 transmission, we model a wave-like pattern of the pandemic and consider the impact of the rate of vaccination and the strength of non-pharmaceutical intervention measures on the probability of emergence of a resistant strain. We found a counterintuitive result that the highest probability for the establishment of the resistant strain comes at a time of reduced non-pharmaceutical intervention measures when most individuals of the population have been vaccinated. Consequently, we show that a period of transmission reduction close to the end of the vaccination campaign can substantially reduce the probability of resistant strain establishment. Our results suggest that policymakers and individuals should consider maintaining non-pharmaceutical interventions [7,11,12] throughout the entire vaccination period.","Rella, S.; Kulikova, Y.; Dermitzakis, E.; Kondrashov, F.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21251383v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.08.21251383,597

We examined change in depression from pre- to post-lockdown restrictions and correlates of elevated depressive symptoms, including antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence. Participants enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of an ART adherence intervention in Uganda. The month-12 follow-up assessment was fully administered just prior to the start of the pandemic-related lockdown in March 2020; at the conclusion of the lockdown three months later, we administered a mixed-methods phone-based assessment. ART adherence was electronically monitored throughout the study period, including during and after the lockdown. Depression was assessed with the 8-item Patient health questionnaire (PHQ-8), on which scores > 9 signify a positive screen for elevated depressive symptoms. A sample of 280 participants completed both the month-12 and post-lockdown assessments. Rates of elevated depressive symptoms nearly tripled from month 12 (n = 17, 6.1%) to the post-lockdown assessment (n = 50, 17.9%; McNemar test < .001). Elevated depressive symptoms at post-lockdown were associated with being female, indicators of economic struggles at month 12 (unemployment, low income, high food insecurity), and lower ART adherence during the 3-month lockdown period [mean of 71.9% (SD = 27.9) vs. 80.8% (SD = 24.1) among those not depressed; p = .041] in bivariate analysis. In multiple regression analysis, higher food insecurity [adj. OR (95% CI) = 4.64 (2.16–9.96)] and perception that the pandemic negatively impacted ART adherence [adj. OR (95% CI) = 1.96 (1.22–3.16)] remained associated with a greater likelihood of elevated depressive symptoms, when other correlates were controlled for. Qualitative data suggested that economic stressors (lack of food, work, and money) were key contributors to elevated depressive symptoms, and these stressors led to missed ART doses because of lack of food and stress induced forgetfulness. Elevated depressive symptoms significantly increased during the COVID-19 lockdown and was associated with food insecurity and reduced ART adherence. Mechanisms for identifying and treating depression and food insecurity are needed to help PLHIV cope with and mitigate the harmful effects of unexpected crises that may impede disease management and access to food.","Wagner, Glenn J.; Wagner, Zachary; Gizaw, Mahlet; Saya, Uzaib; MacCarthy, Sarah; Mukasa, Barbara; Wabukala, Peter; Linnemayr, Sebastian",AIDS Behav,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34570315/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10461-021-03371-0,597

Disease countermeasures rely upon preventing person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV2 so as to protect front-line healthcare workers (HCWs). COVID-19 brings enormous challenges in terms of sustaining the supply chain for single-use-plastic personal and protective equipment (PPE). Post-COVID-19, the changes in medical practice will drive high demand for PPE. Important countermeasures for preventing COVID-19 transmission include mitigating potential high risk aerosol transmission in healthcare setting using medical PPE (such as filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs)) and the appropriate use of face coverings by the general public that carries a lower transmission risk. PPE reuse is a potential short term solution during COVID-19 pandemic where there is increased evidence for effective deployment of reprocessing methods such as vaporized hydrogen peroxide (30 to 35% VH2OH) used alone or combined with ozone, ultraviolet light at 254 nm (2000 mJ/cm2) and moist heat (60 °C at high humidity for 60 min). Barriers to PPE reuse include potentially trust and acceptance by HCWs. Efficacy of face coverings are influenced by the appropriate wearing to cover the nose and mouth, type of material used, number of layers, duration of wearing, and potentially superior use of ties over ear loops. Insertion of a nose clip into cloth coverings may help with maintaining fit. Use of 60 °C for 60 min (such as, use of domestic washing machine and spin dryer) has been advocated for face covering decontamination. Risk of virus infiltration in improvised face coverings is potentially increased by duration of wearing due to humidity, liquid diffusion and virus retention. Future sustained use of PPE will be influenced by the availability of recyclable PPE and by innovative biomedical waste management.","Rowan, Neil J.; Laffey, John G.",Sci Total Environ,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720357880?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720357880; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33207488/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142259,597

This study aims to develop a guide on the best online tools by determining the media preference reflected by health-related information received from social media amongst diabetic patients in Hospital Canselor Tuanku Muhriz (HCTM), Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur. METHODS: This study was conducted cross-sectional on 174 respondents, who were selected by using a simple random sampling method. Socio-demographic data and the use of the internet and media for health-related information were obtained via questionnaires. RESULTS: The most preferred social media used for searching and sharing health-related information was WhatsApp (73.6%), followed by Facebook (67.8%), Instagram (18.4%) and Twitter (17.2%). The social media preference related to socio-demographic data of age was statistically significant (P < 0.002), which had a medium effect. Furthermore, the media preference was not significantly related to health-related information searched or shared on social media and the frequency of usage. CONCLUSION: Indeed, the social media have been an essential media platform to enhance public awareness concerning public health. This calls for evolution to further enhance the use of social media amongst healthcare practitioners to emphasise health promotion and empower the patients to play an active role in their healthcare. This study provides a guideline for the medical researchers, practitioners or healthcare providers in choosing WhatsApp as an online medium to communicate with diabetic patients in the future, specifically in Malaysia.","Siti Zuhaida, Hussein; Chung, Hong Chuo; Mohd Said, Fawwaz; Tumingan, Khairunnisa; Sahar Shah, Nurshalin; Hanim, Suraya; Bakar, Abu",Malays J Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34285650/; https://doi.org/10.21315/mjms2021.28.3.11,597

The highest worldwide mean pooled prevalence was identified for BRV-Crypto (6.69%; confidence interval (CI): 4.27–9.51), followed by BRV-BCoV (2.84%; CI: 1.78–4.08) and BRV-ETEC (1.64%; CI: 0.76–2.75). In all concurrent infections with BRV, the highest mean prevalence was identified in calves with diarrhoea, in dairy herds and in the age classes of sampled animals between 0–14 days. The prevalence of the BRV-BCoV mixed infection is higher than expected based on the ratio of the occurrence of both individual infections in calves with diarrhoea. ABSTRACT: Multiple enteropathogens such as bovine rotavirus (BRV), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), Escherichia coli K99 (ETEC) and Cryptosporidium spp. (Crypto) are the most common causes of calf diarrhoea during the first 30 days of animal age. Three weighted-stratified random-effects meta-analyses were performed to calculate the worldwide prevalence of mixed infections of the causative agents (i.e., BRV-BCoV, BRV-ETEC, BRV-Crypto) and their potential influencing factors. The meta-analysis covered 41 studies (94 sub-studies) in 21 countries that determined the presence or absence of mixed infections in global calf populations. The highest worldwide estimated pooled prevalence was identified for BRV-Crypto (6.69%), followed by BRV-BCoV (2.84%), and BRV-ETEC (1.64%). The chance of detecting BCoV in calves with diarrhoea was 1.83 higher in the presence of BRV compared to calves without BRV, whereby an inhibition effect (odds ratio: 0.77) was determined between BRV and Crypto infections. The diagnostic methods were identified as a significant influencing factor in the detection of all considered mixed infections, while the other analysed factors differed in relation to their effect on prevalence. In contrast to BRV-BCoV, the prevalence of BRV-ETEC and BRV-Crypto mixed infections followed the course of individual ETEC and Crypto prevalence related to the age class of the sampled animals.","Brunauer, Michael; Roch, Franz-Ferdinand; Conrady, Beate",Animals (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/ani11041014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33916839/,597

K150del, a natural variant of APC, is associated with reduced anticoagulant activity. We performed a comprehensive study to analyze the functional alterations of the K150del mutant. Transcriptome analysis of HEK 293T cells treated with wild and mutant APC revealed differentially expressed genes enriched in inflammatory, apoptotic, and virus defense-related signaling pathways. Both wild and mutant APC displayed concentration-dependent cytoprotective effects. Low concentrations of K150del mutant resulted in decreased anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic activities, whereas its higher concentrations restored these effects. Expression of virus defense-related genes improved in mouse lung tissues after repeated administration of the APC variant. These results suggest that the APC K150del mutant could help clinicians to accurately predict disease risks and serve as a potential auxiliary therapeutic in viral infections, including 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).","Lin, Wen-Yi; Tang, Liang; Lu, Xuan; Hu, Yu",Aging (Albany NY),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33896796/; https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.202904,597

This study aims to identify potential viral virulence determinants. We found that neonatal type I interferon receptor knockout mice are susceptible to EV-D68 infection via intraperitoneal inoculation and were able to recapitulate the paralysis process observed in human disease. Among the EV-D68 strains tested, strain US/MO-14-18949 caused no observable disease in this mouse model, whereas the other strains caused paralysis and death. Sequence analysis revealed several conserved genetic changes among these virus strains: nucleotide positions 107 and 648 in the 5′-untranslated region (UTR); amino acid position 88 in VP3; 1, 148, 282 and 283 in VP1; 22 in 2A; 47 in 3A. A series of chimeric and point-mutated infectious clones were constructed to identify viral elements responsible for the distinct virulence. A single amino acid change from isoleucine to valine at position 88 in VP3 attenuated neurovirulence by reducing virus replication in the brain and spinal cord of infected mice.","Yeh, Ming Te; Capponi, Sara; Catching, Adam; Bianco, Simone; Andino, Raul",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32784424/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v12080867,597

Analytic expressions for the peak time and asymptotic behaviours, early doubling time, late half decay time, and a half-early peak law, characterizing the dynamical evolution of number of cases and fatalities, are derived, where the pandemic evolution exhibiting multiple waves is described by the semi-time SIR model. The asymmetry of the epidemic wave and its exponential tail are affected by the initial conditions, a feature that has no analogue in the all-time SIR model. Our analysis reveals that the immunity is very strongly increasing in several countries during the second Covid-19 wave. Wave-specific SIR parameters describing infection and recovery rates we find to behave in a similar fashion. Still, an apparently moderate change of their ratio can have significant consequences. As we show, the probability of an additional wave is however low in several countries due to the fraction of immune inhabitants at the end of the second wave, irrespective of the ongoing vaccination efforts. We compare with alternate approaches and data available at the time of submission. Most recent data serves to demonstrate the successful forecast and high accuracy of the SIR model in predicting the evolution of pandemic outbreaks as long as the assumption underlying our analysis, an unchanged situation of the distribution of variants of concern and the fatality fraction, do not change dramatically during a wave. With the rise of the α variant at the time of submission the second wave did not terminate in some countries, giving rise to a superposition of waves that is not treated by the present contribution.","Kröger, M.; Schlickeiser, R.",Royal Society Open Science,https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.211379; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34567593/,597

The topic selected was fauna in Colombia, and the animals in question were chosen based on important roles they have in areas like health, the environment, and food. These animals will complement science education given to several age groups visiting the museum. In addition to the 3D-manufactured objects, a study was conducted using several age groups that are very relevant to the museum: children, teenagers, and first year undergraduate students. A video showing technical information cards about the manufacturing process was also developed. This project was multidisciplinary, involving collaboration between the engineering school, the museum, and a local high school. The results showed that young visitors want complete information on the animals and to have interaction with the animal models, which is not always possible. This project serves as a local strategy not only for taking arts and knowledge out of the museum but also for planning first year courses in the university and thus reducing problems like school dropout, low motivation, and poor performance in national exams.","Colorado, Henry A.; Mendoza, David E.; Valencia, Fernando L.",J Sci Educ Technol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10956-020-09873-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33132673/,597

We have conducted a study of 42 patients following recovery from COVID-19, including 28 mild and 14 severe cases, comparing their T cell responses to those of 16 control donors. We assessed the immune memory of T cell responses using IFNγ based assays with overlapping peptides spanning SARS-CoV-2 apart from ORF1. We found the breadth, magnitude and frequency of memory T cell responses from COVID-19 were significantly higher in severe compared to mild COVID-19 cases, and this effect was most marked in response to spike, membrane, and ORF3a proteins. Total and spike-specific T cell responses correlated with the anti-Spike, anti-Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) as well as anti-Nucleoprotein (NP) endpoint antibody titre (p<0.001, <0.001 and =0.002). We identified 39 separate peptides containing CD4+ and/or CD8+ epitopes, which strikingly included six immunodominant epitope clusters targeted by T cells in many donors, including 3 clusters in spike (recognised by 29%, 24%, 18% donors), two in the membrane protein (M, 32%, 47%) and one in the nucleoprotein (Np, 35%). CD8+ responses were further defined for their HLA restriction, including B*4001-restricted T cells showing central memory and effector memory phenotype. In mild cases, higher frequencies of multi-cytokine producing M- and NP-specific CD8+ T cells than spike-specific CD8+ T cells were observed. They furthermore showed a higher ratio of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ to CD4+ T cell responses. Immunodominant epitope clusters and peptides containing T cell epitopes identified in this study will provide critical tools to study the role of virus-specific T cells in control and resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The identification of T cell specificity and functionality associated with milder disease, highlights the potential importance of including non-spike proteins within future COVID-19 vaccine design.","Peng, Yanchun; Mentzer, Alexander J.; Liu, Guihai; Yao, Xuan; Yin, Zixi; Dong, Danning; Dejnirattisai, Wanwisa; Rostron, Timothy; Supasa, Piyada; Liu, Chang; Lopez-Camacho, Cesar; Slon-campos, Jose; Zhao, Yuguang; Stuart, Dave; Paeson, Guido; Grimes, Jonathan; Antson, Fred; Bayfield, Oliver W.; Hawkins, Dorothy EDP.; Ker, De-Sheng; Turtle, Lance; Subramaniam, Krishanthi; Thomson, Paul; Zhang, Ping; Dold, Christina; Ratcliff, Jeremy; Simmonds, Peter; de Silva, Thushan; Sopp, Paul; Wellington, Dannielle; Rajapaksa, Ushani; Chen, Yi-Ling; Salio, Mariolina; Napolitani, Giorgio; Paes, Wayne; Borrow, Persephone; Kessler, Benedikt; Fry, Jeremy W.; Schwabe, Nikolai F.; Semple, Malcolm G; Baillie, Kenneth J.; Moore, Shona; Openshaw, Peter JM; Ansari, Azim; Dunachie, Susanna; Barnes, Ellie; Frater, John; Kerr, Georgina; Goulder, Philip; Lockett, Teresa; Levin, Robert; Cornall, Richard J.; Conlon, Chris; Klenerman, Paul; McMichael, Andrew; Screaton, Gavin; Mongkolsapaya, Juthathip; Knight, Julian C.; Ogg, Graham; Dong, Tao",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32577665/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.05.134551,597

The discovery of differentially methylated sites (DMSs) that continuously change over an individual’s lifetime has led to breakthroughs in molecular age estimation. Although semen samples are often used in forensic DNA analysis, previous epigenetic age prediction studies mainly focused on somatic cell types. Here, Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip arrays were applied to semen-derived DNA samples, which identified numerous novel DMSs moderately correlated with age. Validation of the ten most age-correlated novel DMSs and three previously known sites in an independent set of semen-derived DNA samples using targeted bisulfite massively parallel sequencing, confirmed age-correlation for nine new and three previously known markers. Prediction modelling revealed the best model for semen, based on 6 CpGs from newly identified genes SH2B2, EXOC3, IFITM2, and GALR2 as well as the previously known FOLH1B gene, which predict age with a mean absolute error of 5.1 years in an independent test set.

Most of studies (73.6%) aimed to recruit fewer than 500 people. Interferon was the main prevention program, and antiviral drugs were the main treatment program. Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine (230/943, 24.4%) were widely studied. Some registered clinical trials are incomplete in content, and 37.4% of the 1,706 studies may have had insufficient sample size. CONCLUSION: The quality of COVID-19 related studies needs to be improved by strengthening the registration process and improving the quality of clinical study protocols so that these clinical studies can provide high-quality clinical evidence related to COVID-19.","Ma, Lin-Lu; Yin, Xuan; Li, Bing-Hui; Yang, Jia-Yu; Jin, Ying-Hui; Huang, Di; Deng, Tong; Wang, Yun-Yun; Ren, Xue-Qun; Ji, Jianguang; Zeng, Xian-Tao",Front Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2020.540187; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32982751/,597

The objective of this study is to report the incidence and outcome of COVID-19 following surgical resection of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in Paris Public Hospitals during the pandemic. Methods We retrospective analyzed a prospective database including all patients who underwent NSCLC resection between March 14th 2020 and May 11th 2020 in the 5 thoracic surgery units of Paris Public Hospitals. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the first 30 days following surgery. Results Study group included 115 patients (male 57%, age 64.6±10.7, adenocarcinoma 66%, cT1 62%, cN0 82%). During the first month after surgery, 6 patients (5%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. As compared to COVID negative patients, COVID positive patients were more likely to be operated on during the first month of the pandemic (100% vs. 54%, p=0.03) and to be on corticosteroids preoperatively (33% vs. 4%, p=0.03). Postoperative COVID-19 was associated with an increased rate of readmission (50% vs. 5%, p=0.004), but no difference in 30-day morbidity (for the study group: grade 2, 24%; grade 3, 7%; grade 4, 1%) or mortality (n=1 COVID negative patient, 0.9%). Immediate oncological outcomes did not differ significantly between groups (R0 resection 99%, nodal upstaging 14%, adjuvant treatment 29%). Conclusions During the COVID-19 pandemic, surgical treatment of NSCLC was associated with a rate of postoperative COVID-19 of 5% with a significant impact on readmissions but not on other outcomes studied.","Leclère, Jean-Baptiste; Fournel, Ludovic; Etienne, Harry; Al Zreibi, Charbel; Onorati, Ilaria; Roussel, Arnaud; Castier, Yves; Martinod, Emmanuel; Le Pimpec-Barthes, Françoise; Alifano, Marco; Assouad, Jalal; Mordant, Pierre",Ann Thorac Surg,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2020.08.007; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0003497520316313; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33038341/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003497520316313?v=s5,597

The recognition of the key role for increased inflammation in COVID-19 has led to a proliferation of clinical trials targeting inflammation. The purpose of this review is to characterize the current state of immunotherapy trials in COVID-19, and focuses on associated cardiotoxicities, given the importance of pharmacovigilance. The search terms related to COVID-19 were queried in ClinicalTrials.gov. A total of 1621 trials were identified and screened for interventional trials directed at inflammation. Trials (n = 226) were fully assessed for the use of a repurposed drug, identifying a total of 141 therapeutic trials using a repurposed drug to target inflammation in COVID-19 infection. Building on the results of the Randomized Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy (RECOVERY) trial demonstrating the benefit of low dose dexamethasone in COVID-19, repurposed drugs targeting inflammation are promising. Repurposed drugs directed at inflammation in COVID-19 primarily have been drawn from cancer therapies and immunomodulatory therapies, specifically targeted anti-inflammatory, anti-complement, and anti-rejection agents. The proposed mechanisms for many cytokine-directed and anti-rejection drugs are focused on evidence of efficacy in cytokine release syndromes in humans or animal models. Anti-complement-based therapies have the potential to decrease both inflammation and microvascular thrombosis. Cancer therapies are hypothesized to decrease vascular permeability and inflammation. Few publications to date describe using these drugs in COVID-19. Early COVID-19 intervention trials have re-emphasized the subtle, but important cardiotoxic sequelae of potential therapies on outcomes. The volume of trials targeting the COVID-19 hyper-inflammatory phase continues to grow rapidly with the evaluation of repurposed drugs and late-stage investigational agents. Leveraging known clinical safety profiles and pharmacodynamics allows swift investigation in clinical trials for a novel indication. Physicians should remain vigilant for cardiotoxicity, often not fully appreciated in small trials or in short time frames.","Campbell, Courtney M.; Guha, Avirup; Haque, Tamanna; Neilan, Tomas G.; Addison, Daniel",J Clin Med,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9092935; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32932930/,597

In Australia, nationwide restrictions included staying at home, unless seeking medical care, providing care, purchasing food, undertaking exercise, or attending work in an essential service. All undergraduate university classes transitioned to online, mostly home-based learning. We, therefore, examined the effect of isolation measures during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia (March/April) on diet (24-h recall) and physical activity (Active Australia Survey) patterns in third-year biomedical students. Findings were compared with students enrolled in the same course in the previous two years. In females, but not males, energy intake was ~20% greater during the pandemic, and snacking frequency and energy density of consumed snacks also increased compared with 2018 and 2019. Physical activity was impacted for both sexes during the pandemic with ~30% fewer students achieving “sufficient” levels of activity, defined by at least 150 min over at least five sessions, compared with the previous two years. In a follow-up study six to eight weeks later (14–18% response rate), during gradual easing of nationwide restrictions albeit continued gym closures and online learning, higher energy intake in females and reduced physical activity levels in both sexes persisted. These data demonstrate the health impacts of isolation measures, with the potential to affect long-term diet and activity behaviours.","Gallo, Linda A.; Gallo, Tania F.; Young, Sophia L.; Moritz, Karen M.; Akison, Lisa K.",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32585830/; https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12061865,597

628083,Prisoners in a pandemic: We should think about detainees during Covid-19 outbreak,2020-06-03,"The GeXP-based assay has recently been developed for simultaneous detection of multiple pathogens. So far, the application of the GeXP assay to test larger clinical samples has hardly been reported. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the leading cause of death in children worldwide and a substantial proportion of childhood CAP is caused by viruses. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of virus infection is important for the clinical management of CAP. In this study, we explored the GeXP assay for simultaneous detection of 20 types/subtypes of viruses in hospitalized children with CAP. A total of 1699 nasopharyngeal swabs were prospectively collected and viral nucleic acid was extracted and assayed. Using viral genomic DNA or RNA as template, we showed that at the concentration of 10(4) copies of DNA or RNA of each virus/μl, all 20 target viruses were simultaneously identified by the GeXP assay. Fifteen control microorganisms, in contrast, failed to be amplified by the assay. About 65% of cases tested in this study had viral infection, with patients aged <3 years having a 70% positive rate, significantly higher than that in patients aged > 3 years (40%). The most frequently detected virus was RSV followed by PIV3, HRV, ADV and HBoV. Seasonal distribution analysis revealed that RSV was the most predominant in autumn and winter, while in spring and summer PIV3 and RSV were the most frequently identified with similar positive percentages. One hundred twenty randomly-chosen samples tested by the GeXP assay were re-evaluated by mono-RT-PCR, the results showed 97.5% diagnosis agreement between these 2 methods. Our findings suggest that the GeXP assay could be a valuable diagnostic tool for virus infection in pediatric patients with CAP.","Wang, Le; Zhao, Mengchuan; Shi, Zhongren; Feng, Zhishan; Guo, Weiwei; Yang, Shuo; Liu, Lanping; Li, Guixia",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27627439/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0162411,597

METHODS: The search function of Twitter (TW) and Instagram (IG) was used to generate a list of accounts with the terms: fertility, infertility, ttc, egg freezing, ivf, endometriosis, and reproductive. Accounts not in English, in private, with no posts in > 1 year, or with content unrelated to search terms were excluded. Accounts were assessed for author type; REI board certification (REI-BC); influencer (INF) status (> 10 K followers on IG; verified check mark on TW); account demographics; and content in last 5 posts. Statistical analysis included unpaired t tests, a classification and regression tree (CART) analysis, and stepwise multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: Seven hundred ten accounts were identified and 537 (278 TW, 259 IG) were included. Account types included societies, clinics, physicians, patients, groups, and “other.” Instagram content (1290 posts reviewed) was primarily personal stories (31.7%) or inspiration/support (23.7%). Twitter content (1390 posts reviewed) was mostly promotion (28.2%) and research/education (20.2%). Thirty-nine accounts (12.5%) were influencers. Fertility influencers were most often awareness/support accounts (59.8% TW, 25.0% IG), patients (12.8% TW, 25% IG), or other (17.9% TW, 21.0% IG). Only 7.7% TW and 7.1% IG INFs were board-certified REI physicians. The best predictor for classification as an influencer was high activity (> 50 posts/month TW, > 10 posts/month IG). CONCLUSION: As patients increasingly utilize social media to obtain and engage with health information, it is critical to understand the fertility-related SM landscape. This understanding may help to successfully enhance relationships with patients and ensure dissemination of accurate information.","Blakemore, Jennifer K.; Bayer, Arielle H.; Smith, Meghan B.; Grifo, James A.",J Assist Reprod Genet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32382959/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10815-020-01799-2,597

Although our understanding of coronaviruses has undergone a huge leap after two precedents, the effective approaches to treatment and epidemiological control are still lacking. In this article, we present a succinct overview of the epidemiology, clinical features, and molecular characteristics of SARS-CoV-2. We summarize the current epidemiological and clinical data from the initial Wuhan studies, and emphasize several features of SARS-CoV-2, which differentiate it from SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), such as high variability of disease presentation. We systematize the current clinical trials that have been rapidly initiated after the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. Whereas the trials on SARS-CoV-2 genome-based specific vaccines and therapeutic antibodies are currently being tested, this solution is more long-term, as they require thorough testing of their safety. On the other hand, the repurposing of the existing therapeutic agents previously designed for other virus infections and pathologies happens to be the only practical approach as a rapid response measure to the emergent pandemic, as most of these agents have already been tested for their safety. These agents can be divided into two broad categories, those that can directly target the virus replication cycle, and those based on immunotherapy approaches either aimed to boost innate antiviral immune responses or alleviate damage induced by dysregulated inflammatory responses. The initial clinical studies revealed the promising therapeutic potential of several of such drugs, including favipiravir, a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that interferes with the viral replication, and hydroxychloroquine, the repurposed antimalarial drug that interferes with the virus endosomal entry pathway. We speculate that the current pandemic emergency will be a trigger for more systematic drug repurposing design approaches based on big data analysis.","Tu, Yung-Fang; Chien, Chian-Shiu; Yarmishyn, Aliaksandr A.; Lin, Yi-Ying; Luo, Yung-Hung; Lin, Yi-Tsung; Lai, Wei-Yi; Yang, De-Ming; Chou, Shih-Jie; Yang, Yi-Ping; Wang, Mong-Lien; Chiou, Shih-Hwa",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32290293/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21072657,597
629082,Early COVID-19 Government Communication Is Associated With Reduced Interest in the QAnon Conspiracy Theory,2021-08-31,"Although researchers from hospitals, universities, and government agencies have concluded that facial coverings (masks) could be one of the most cost‐effective tools to slow the spread of COVID‐19 and accelerate economic recovery (Greenhalgh et al., 2020), parental concern for elementary school children wearing masks is still an issue. Face masks can cause discomfort which may lead to general irritation resulting in potential anxiety and subsequent distraction from instructional material delivered in a school setting (Lee et al., 2005). The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of wearing a facial covering and the impacts on memory, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and emotional state on a 5‐point Likert scale (Buron & Curtis, 2003) throughout 30 minutes of regularly scheduled academic content in students grades K‐5. All participants (N=60) were recruited from the same school and data were analyzed via paired samples t‐tests. There was a trend in students to rate their emotional state as more positive at 0 minutes in the non‐masked condition compared to the masked condition (1.23 ± 0.54 vs. 1.15 ± 0.363; p=0.058). However, vocabulary memory recall was more accurate in the masked condition (8.06 words ± 2.20 vs. 6.72 words ± 2.43; p=0.001). Upon further investigation, this significance was driven by the students in grades 3‐5 (N=27) (9.41 ± 0.80 words vs. 7.85 ± 1.29 words; p=0.001) opposed to students in grades K‐2 (N=26) (6.65 ± 2.31 words vs. 5.54 ± 2.77 words; p=0.12) in masked vs. non‐masked conditions. Heart rate and oxygen saturation fluctuations between the masked and non‐masked students over the 30 minutes of instructional time were nonsignificant (p˃0.05). We concluded that though there were no apparent adverse biological (heart rate and peripheral oxygen saturation) effects on elementary school children while wearing a cloth face covering in the classroom for 30 consecutive minutes of instructional time, there appears to be some cognitive benefit to wearing a facial covering in memory recall for students particularly in grades 3‐5 that warrants further exploration.","Smith, Jenna; Culler, Airianna; Scanlon, Kelsey",FASEB J,https://doi.org/10.1096/fasebj.2021.35.s1.04955,597

OBJECTIVES: To query the international spinal cord medicine community’s engagement with and response to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and to assess pandemic-specific information needs and patient concerns. SETTING: An international collaboration of authors and participants. METHODS: Two near-identical surveys (one English and one Spanish language) were distributed via the internet. Responses from those questions shared between the surveys were pooled then analyzed; four questions’ responses (those not shared) were analyzed separately. RESULTS: A total of 783 responses were submitted from six continents. Few participants (5.8%) had tested their outpatients with SCI/D for COVID-19; only 4.4% reported having a patient with SCI/D with the virus. Of respondents who worked at an inpatient facility, 53.3% reported that only individuals with symptoms were being screened and 29.9% said that no screening was occurring. Participants relayed several concerns offered by their patients with SCI/D, including vulnerability to infection (76.9%) and fragility of caretaker supply (42%), and those living in countries with guaranteed health care were more likely to report widespread availability of COVID-19 testing than were those living in countries without universal care, χ(2) (3, N = 625) = 46.259, p < 0.001. CONCLUSION: There is substantial variability in the rehabilitation medicine community in COVID-19 screening practices and availability of screening kits.

Lightening the burden not only depends on government agencies, but also needs extensive social organization participation. However, few studies focus on how to promote social cooperation to support the provision of emergency supplies. This study aimed to find out the theoretical mechanism to expand the cooperative networks of supply support organizations during the epidemic. Data from the emergency response to the COVID-19 pandemic in China were used. Three cooperative networks from a progressive perspective were constructed based on the cooperative relationships among organizations. The expansion mechanism was verified by the exponential random graph model. The results show that when the institutional network expands into an interactive network, the composition of organization types has changed, but the cooperative network’s efficiency does not improve much. The matching effect of the organizational type and the Matthew effect of nodes are both effective paths to promote cooperative network expansion, however, the structure effect shows that complex relationship structure is not a critical factor. Our findings highlight the importance of core organizations and the function of different types of organizations in building cooperative network as well as providing theoretical frameworks for policymakers to use in guiding and motivating social cooperation in emergency supplies.","Lian, Chenxi; Wang, Jian; Liu, Jida",Healthcare (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9081041; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34442177/,597

We think that informing the orthopedic community about the strategy that we adopted both in our hospital and in our Department of Orthopedics could be useful, particularly for those who are facing the pandemic later than Italy. METHODS: Changes were done in our hospital by medical direction to reallocate resources to COVID-19 patients. In the Orthopedic Department, a decrease in the number of beds and surgical activity was stabilized. Since March 13, it has been avoided to perform elective surgery, and since March 16, non-urgent outpatient consultations were abolished. This activity reduction was associated with careful evaluation of staff and patients: extensive periodical swab testing of all healthcare staff and swab testing of all surgical patients were applied. RESULTS: These restrictions determined an overall reduction of all our surgical activities of 30% compared to 2019. We also had a reduction in outpatient clinic activities and admissions to the orthopedic emergency unit. Extensive swab testing has proven successful: of more than 160 people tested in our building, only three COVID-19 positives were found, and of over more than 200 surgical procedures, only two positive patients were found.

Three people were confirmed positive for COVID-19 based on two consecutive positive RT PCR tests whilst 25 people were excluded based on two consecutive negative tests. The three COVID-19 confirmed cases received non-critical care. There were no new infections of medical staff or new infections of other hospital inpatients. Conclusions: All three cases were detected as a result of vigilant monitoring of hospital visitors. Whilst screening out-patients presenting to a fever clinic remains important, monitoring visitors must not be overlooked.","Pu, Hong; Xu, Yujun; Doig, Gordon S.; Zhou, Yan",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.20.20038679,597

Therefore, research for methods of treatment and prevention of COVID-19 positive pregnancies carries an importance. The aim of this study was to measure serum 25(OH)D, vitamin B12, and zinc levels in COVID-19 positive pregnant women to evaluate the role of these micronutrients in treatment and prevention. A total of 44 COVID-19 positive pregnant women who were hospitalized and treated at a tertiary clinic were included in this study. The mean serum 25(OH)D level was measured to be 9.70 ± 59.14. The mean serum zinc level was 62.58 ± 2.63, and the mean serum vitamin B12 level was 295.55 ± 302.48. All these variables were significantly lower than the accepted cut-off values (p < 0.001). These low values might have contributed to a deficiency in their immune response and thus made these patients susceptible to COVID-19 infection. Supplementation of micronutrients during the pandemic could be beneficial during pregnancy for prevention.","Yalcin Bahat, Pinar; Aldikactioglu Talmac, Merve; Bestel, Ayşegul; Topbas Selcuki, Nura F; Aydın, Zelal; Polat, İbrahim",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.10609; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32983745/,597

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed and included adult inpatients hospitalized from March 17th to May 3rd, 2020, who were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Clinical and demographic characteristics were extracted from electronic medical records. RESULTS: Overall, 88 consecutive patients were included in this study. The median age of the patients was 63 years (IQR 49 - 71); 59 (67%) were male, 65 (86%) had a college degree and 67 (76%) had at least one comorbidity. Twenty-nine (33%) patients were admitted to the intensive care unit, 18 (20%) patients needed mechanical ventilation, and 9 (10.2%) died during hospitalization. The median length of stay in the intensive care unit and the median duration of mechanical ventilation was 23 and 29.5 days, respectively. An age ≥ 65 years was an independent risk factor for mechanical ventilation (OR 8.4 95%CI 1.3 - 55.6 p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Our findings describe the first wave of Brazilian patients hospitalized for COVID-19.

631524,An Unusual and Unexpected Result of Diagnostic Sampling for COVID-19,2020-10-16,"To date, limited genetic changes in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genome have been described. Here, we report a 382-nucleotide (nt) deletion in SARS-CoV-2 that truncates open reading frame 7b (ORF7b) and ORF8, removing the ORF8 transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) and eliminating ORF8 transcription. The earliest 382-nt deletion variant was detected in Singapore on 29 January 2020, with the deletion viruses circulating in the country and accounting for 23.6% (45/191) of SARS-CoV-2 samples screened in this study. SARS-CoV-2 with the same deletion has since been detected in Taiwan, and other ORF7b/8 deletions of various lengths, ranging from 62 nt to 345 nt, have been observed in other geographic locations, including Australia, Bangladesh, and Spain. Mutations or deletions in ORF8 of SARS-CoV have been associated with reduced replicative fitness and virus attenuation. In contrast, the SARS-CoV-2 382-nt deletion viruses showed significantly higher replicative fitness in vitro than the wild type, while no difference was observed in patient viral load, indicating that the deletion variant viruses retained their replicative fitness. A robust antibody response to ORF8 has been observed in SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that the emergence of ORF8 deletions may be due to immune-driven selection and that further deletion variants may emerge during the sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in humans.","Su, Yvonne C.

632106,A Simplified Point-of-Care Lung Ultrasound Protocol to Detect Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Inpatients: A Prospective Observational Study,2021-04-20,"Background Infection with SARS-CoV-2 manifests itself as a mild respiratory tract infection in the majority of individuals, which progresses to a severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in 10-15% of patients. Inflammation plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of ARDS, with immune dysregulation in severe COVID-19 leading to a hyperinflammatory response. A comprehensive understanding of the inflammatory process in COVID-19 is lacking. Methods In this prospective, multicenter observational study, patients with PCR-proven or clinically presumed COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) or clinical wards were included. Demographic and clinical data were obtained and plasma was serially collected. Concentrations of IL-6, TNF-, complement components C3a, C3c and the terminal complement complex (TCC) were determined in plasma by ELISA. Additionally, 269 circulating biomarkers were assessed using targeted proteomics. Results were compared between ICU and non ICU patients. Findings A total of 119 (38 ICU and 91 non ICU) patients were included. IL-6 plasma concentrations were elevated in COVID-19 (ICU vs. non ICU, median 174.5 pg/ml [IQR 94.5-376.3 vs. 40.0 pg/ml [16.5-81.0]), whereas TNF- concentrations were relatively low and not different between ICU and non ICU patients (median 24.0 pg/ml [IQR 16.5-33.5] and 21.5 pg/ml [IQR 16.0-33.5], respectively). C3a and terminal complement complex (TCC) concentrations were significantly higher in ICU vs. non ICU patients (median 556.0 ng/ml [IQR 333.3-712.5]) vs. 266.5 ng/ml [IQR 191.5-384.0 for C3a and 4506 mAU/ml [IQR 3661-6595 vs. 3582 mAU/ml [IQR 2947-4300] for TCC) on the first day of blood sampling. Targeted proteomics demonstrated that IL-6 (logFC 2.2), several chemokines and hepatocyte growth factor (logFC 1.4) were significantly upregulated in ICU vs. non ICU patients. In contrast, stem cell factor was significantly downregulated (logFC -1.3) in ICU vs. non ICU patients, as were DPP4 (logFC -0.4) and protein C inhibitor (log FC -1.0), the latter two factors also being involved in the regulation of the kinin-kallikrein pathway. Unsupervised clustering pointed towards a homogeneous pathogenetic mechanism in the majority of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, with patient clustering mainly based on disease severity. Interpretation We identified important pathways involved in dysregulation of inflammation in patients with severe COVID-19, including the IL-6, complement system and kinin-kallikrein pathways. Our findings may aid the development of new approaches to host-directed therapy.","van de Veerdonk, F. L.; Janssen, N. A. F.; Grondman, I.; de Nooijer, A. H.; Koeken, V. A. C.

632754,A Case of COVID-19-Related Thrombocytopenia and Leukopenia in an Adolescent with Mild Symptoms,2021-06-16,"Objectives: Norway and Sweden, two neighboring countries with similar populations, health care systems and socioeconomics, have reacted differently to the COVID-19 pandemic. Norway closed all kindergartens, schools and universities, and banned sports and cultural activities, while Sweden kept most institutions and trainings facilities open. We aimed to compare peoples' attitudes towards authorities and control measures, and effects on life in Norway and Sweden. Design: Anonymous web-based surveys for individuals age 15 or older distributed through Facebook using the snowball method. Setting: Norway and Sweden, mid-March to mid-April, 2020. Participants: Altogether, 3,508 individuals participated in the survey; 3000 in Norway and 508 in Sweden. 79% of the participants were women, 60% of the Norwegians and 47% of the Swedes were between 30-49 years, and around 45% of the participants in both countries had more than 4 years of higher education. Outcome measures: Perceived threat of the pandemic, views on infection control measures, and impact on daily life. We performed descriptive analyses of the responses and compared the two countries. Results: People had high trust in the health services in both countries, but differed in the degree of trust in their government (17% had high trust in Norway and 37% in Sweden). More Norwegians than Swedes agreed that school closure was a good measure (66% Norway and 18% in Sweden), and that countries with open schools were irresponsible (65% in Norway and 23% in Sweden). About the same amount responded that COVID-19 was a large to very large threat to the population (53% in Norway and 58% in Sweden), whereas more Norwegians than Swedes responded that the threat from repercussions of the mitigation measures were large or very large (71% in Norway and 56% in Sweden). Compliance with infection preventive measures was high and similar in the two countries (more than 98%). In Norway, 69% lived a more sedentary life during the pandemic versus 50% in Sweden; and Norwegians reported they ate more than Swedes (44% in Norway and 33% in Sweden). Conclusion: Sweden, with less restrictive measures against the COVID-19 pandemic, had a higher level of trust in the authorities, while Norwegians reported a more negative lifestyle during the pandemic. The level of trust in the health care system and self-reported compliance with preventive measures was high in both countries.","Helsingen, Lise M.; Refsum, Erle; Gjostein, Dagryn Kyte; Loberg, Magnus; Bretthauer, Michael; Kalager, Mette; Emilsson, Louise",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.16.20089953; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.16.20089953v1?rss=1,597

The recommended interval between doses is 21 days for Pfizer-BioNTech and 28 days for Moderna; however, up to 42 days between doses is permissible when a delay is unavoidable.§ Two analyses of COVID-19 vaccine administration data were conducted among persons who initiated the vaccination series during December 14, 2020-February 14, 2021, and whose doses were reported to CDC through February 20, 2021. The first analysis was conducted to determine whether persons who received a first dose and had sufficient time to receive the second dose (i.e., as of February 14, 2021, >25 days from receipt of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine or >32 days from receipt of Moderna vaccine had elapsed) had received the second dose. A second analysis was conducted among persons who received a second COVID-19 dose by February 14, 2021, to determine whether the dose was received during the recommended dosing interval, which in this study was defined as 17-25 days (Pfizer-BioNTech) and 24-32 days (Moderna) after the first dose. Analyses were stratified by jurisdiction and by demographic characteristics. In the first analysis, among 12,496,258 persons who received the first vaccine dose and for whom sufficient time had elapsed to receive the second dose, 88.0% had completed the series, 8.6% had not received the second dose but remained within the allowable interval (≤42 days since the first dose), and 3.4% had missed the second dose (outside the allowable interval, >42 days since the first dose). The percentage of persons who missed the second dose varied by jurisdiction (range = 0.0%-9.1%) and among demographic groups was highest among non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) persons (5.1%) and persons aged 16-44 years (4.0%). In the second analysis, among 14,205,768 persons who received a second dose, 95.6% received the dose within the recommended interval, although percentages varied by jurisdiction (range = 79.0%-99.9%). Public health officials should identify and address possible barriers to completing the COVID-19 vaccination series to ensure equitable coverage across communities and maximum health benefits for recipients. Strategies to ensure series completion could include scheduling second-dose appointments at the first-dose administration and sending reminders for second-dose visits.","Kriss, Jennifer L.; Reynolds, Laura E.; Wang, Alice; Stokley, Shannon; Cole, Matthew M.; Harris, LaTreace Q.; Shaw, Lauren K.; Black, Carla L.; Singleton, James A.; Fitter, David L.; Rose, Dale A.; Ritchey, Matthew D.; Toblin, Robin L.",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7011e2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33735162/,597

Limited data exist informing the relationship between anticoagulation therapy and risk for COVID-19 related hospitalization and mortality. METHODS: We evaluated all patients over the age of 18 diagnosed with COVID-19 in a prospective cohort study from March 4th to August 27th, 2020 among 12 hospitals and 60 clinics of M Health Fairview system (USA). We investigated the relationship between (1) 90-day anticoagulation therapy among outpatients before COVID-19 diagnosis and the risk for hospitalization and mortality and (2) Inpatient anticoagulation therapy and mortality risk. FINDINGS: Of 6195 patients, 598 were immediately hospitalized and 5597 were treated as outpatients. The overall case-fatality rate was 2•8% (n = 175 deaths). Among the patients who were hospitalized, the inpatient mortality was 13%. Among the 5597 COVID-19 patients initially treated as outpatients, 160 (2.9%) were on anticoagulation and 331 were eventually hospitalized (5.9%). In a multivariable analysis, outpatient anticoagulation use was associated with a 43% reduction in risk for hospital admission, HR (95% CI = 0.57, 0.38–0.86), p = 0.007, but was not associated with mortality, HR (95% CI=0.88, 0.50 - 1.52), p = 0.64. Inpatients who were not on anticoagulation (before or after hospitalization) had an increased risk for mortality, HR (95% CI = 2.26, 1.17–4.37), p = 0.015. INTERPRETATION: Outpatients with COVID-19 who were on outpatient anticoagulation at the time of diagnosis experienced a 43% reduced risk of hospitalization. Failure to initiate anticoagulation upon hospitalization or maintaining outpatient anticoagulation in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was associated with increased mortality risk.

A number of non-volatile and volatile techniques were then used to chemically deconstruct the products. Consumer analysis (i.e., 129 Northern Californian consumers) was also used to evaluate a selection of these NABs (i.e., 12) and how similar they thought the aroma, taste and mouthfeels of these products were to beer, soda, and water. The results show that certain constituents drive the aroma and taste profiles which are responsible for invoking beer perception for these North American consumers. Further, beer likeness might not be a driver of preference in this diverse beverage class for Northern Californian consumers. These are important insights for brewers planning to create products for similar markets and/or more broadly for companies interested in designing other functional/alternative food and beverage products.","Lafontaine, Scott; Senn, Kay; Knoke, Laura; Schubert, Christian; Dennenlöhr, Johanna; Maxminer, Jörg; Cantu, Annegret; Rettberg, Nils; Heymann, Hildegarde",Foods,https://doi.org/10.3390/foods9121914; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33371467/,597

Further, the sudden shutdown of core facilities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic has created an unprecedented work stoppage. In these and other research settings, a robust and reliable means of cryopreservation of immune samples is required. We evaluated different fixation and cryopreservation protocols of disaggregated tumor cells with the aim of identifying a protocol for subsequent flow cytometry of the thawed sample, which most accurately reflects the flow cytometric analysis of the tumor immune microenvironment of a freshly disaggregated and analyzed sample. Cohorts of C57BL/6 mice bearing B78 melanoma tumors were evaluated using dual lymphoid and myeloid immunophenotyping panels involving fixation and cryopreservation at three distinct points during the workflow. Results demonstrate that freezing samples after all staining and fixation are completed most accurately matches the results from noncryopreserved equivalent samples. We observed that cryopreservation of living, unfixed cells introduces a nonuniform alteration to PD1 expression. We confirm the utility of our cryopreservation protocol by comparing tumors treated with in situ tumor vaccines, analyzing both fresh and cryopreserved tumor samples with similar results.

The most common types of feline spinal cord diseases documented were inflammatory/infectious diseases, and feline infectious peritonitis was the most common disease, representing approximately 50% of all feline myelitis. Neoplasms were documented in approximately 25% of cases; lymphosarcoma was the most common tumor affecting the spinal cord of cats, with reported prevalence between 28% and 40%. Cats diagnosed with spinal lymphosarcoma were significantly younger (median age 4 years) than cats with other spinal cord tumors (median age 10 years). Cats with clinical signs of intervertebral disc disease had a median age of 8 years, and 67% had Hansen type I disc protrusions. The most commonly affected intervertebral disc was at the L4 to L5 intervertebral disc space. Fibrocartilaginous embolism-affected older cats (median age 10 years), seemed to predominate in the cervicothoracic intumescence, and clinical signs were markedly lateralized, especially when the cervical region was affected.","Marioni-Henry, Katia",Vet Clin North Am Small Anim Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20732602/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S019556161000063X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cvsm.2010.05.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019556161000063X,597

634187,Genetic correlations between COVID-19 and a variety of traits and diseases,2021-04-29,"BACKGROUND: Misuse of substances is common, can be serious and costly to society, and often goes untreated due to barriers to accessing care. Woebot is a mental health digital solution informed by cognitive behavioral therapy and built upon an artificial intelligence–driven platform to deliver tailored content to users. In a previous 2-week randomized controlled trial, Woebot alleviated depressive symptoms. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to adapt Woebot for the treatment of substance use disorders (W-SUDs) and examine its feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy. METHODS: American adults (aged 18-65 years) who screened positive for substance misuse without major health contraindications were recruited from online sources and flyers and enrolled between March 27 and May 6, 2020. In a single-group pre/postdesign, all participants received W-SUDs for 8 weeks. W-SUDs provided mood, craving, and pain tracking and modules (psychoeducational lessons and psychotherapeutic tools) using elements of dialectical behavior therapy and motivational interviewing. Paired samples t tests and McNemar nonparametric tests were used to examine within-subject changes from pre- to posttreatment on measures of substance use, confidence, cravings, mood, and pain. RESULTS: The sample (N=101) had a mean age of 36.8 years (SD 10.0), and 75.2% (76/101) of the participants were female, 78.2% (79/101) were non-Hispanic White, and 72.3% (73/101) were employed. Participants’ W-SUDs use averaged 15.7 (SD 14.2) days, 12.1 (SD 8.3) modules, and 600.7 (SD 556.5) sent messages. About 94% (562/598) of all completed psychoeducational lessons were rated positively. From treatment start to end, in-app craving ratings were reduced by half (87/101, 86.1% reporting cravings in the app; odds ratio 0.48, 95% CI 0.32-0.73). Posttreatment assessment completion was 50.5% (51/101), with better retention among those who initially screened higher on substance misuse. From pre- to posttreatment, confidence to resist urges to use substances significantly increased (mean score change +16.9, SD 21.4; P<.001), whereas past month substance use occasions (mean change −9.3, SD 14.1; P<.001) and scores on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Concise (mean change −1.3, SD 2.6; P<.001), 10-item Drug Abuse Screening Test (mean change −1.2, SD 2.0; P<.001), Patient Health Questionnaire-8 item (mean change 2.1, SD 5.2; P=.005), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (mean change −2.3, SD 4.7; P=.001), and cravings scale (68.6% vs 47.1% moderate to extreme; P=.01) significantly decreased. Most participants would recommend W-SUDs to a friend (39/51, 76%) and reported receiving the service they desired (41/51, 80%). Fewer felt W-SUDs met most or all of their needs (22/51, 43%). CONCLUSIONS: W-SUDs was feasible to deliver, engaging, and acceptable and was associated with significant improvements in substance use, confidence, cravings, depression, and anxiety. Study attrition was high. Future research will evaluate W-SUDs in a randomized controlled trial with a more diverse sample and with the use of greater study retention strategies.

634815,Rotational Thromboelastometry predicts care level in Covid-19,2020-06-12,"OBJECT: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted all aspects of society globally. As healthcare resources had to be preserved for infected patients, and the risk of in-hospital procedures escalated for uninfected patients and staff, neurosurgeons around the world have had to postpone non-emergent procedures. Under these unprecedented conditions, the decision to defer cases became increasingly difficult as COVID-19 cases skyrocketed. METHODS: Data was collected by self-reporting surveys during two discrete periods: the principal survey accrued responses during 2 weeks at the peak of the global pandemic, and the supplemental survey accrued responses after that to detect changes in opinions and circumstances. Nine hypothetical surgical scenarios were used to query neurosurgeons’ opinion on the risk of postponement and the urgency to re-schedule the procedures. An acuity index was generated for each scenario, and this was used to rank the nine cases. RESULTS: There were 494 respondents to the principal survey from 60 countries. 258 (52.5%) reported that all elective cases and clinics have been shut down by their main hospital. A total of 226 respondents (46.1%) reported that their operative volume had dropped more than 50%. For the countries most affected by COVID-19, this proportion was 54.7%. There was a high degree of agreement among our respondents that fast-evolving neuro-oncological cases are non-emergent cases that nonetheless have the highest risk in postponement, and selected vascular cases may have high acuity as well. CONCLUSION: We report on the impact of COVID-19 on neurosurgeons around the world. From their ranking of the nine case scenarios, we deduced a strategic scheme that can serve as a guideline to triage non-emergent neurosurgical procedures during the pandemic. With it, hopefully, neurosurgeons can continue to serve their patients without endangering them either neurologically or risking their exposure to the deadly virus.

634852,COVID-19 and dialysis: why we should be worried,2020-04-22,"BACKGROUND: Plasma hyaluronan concentrations are increased during sepsis but underlying mechanisms leading to high plasma hyaluronan concentration are poorly understood. In this study we evaluate the roles of plasma hyaluronan, effective plasma hyaluronidase (HYAL) activity and its endogenous plasma inhibition in clinical and experimental sepsis. We specifically hypothesized that plasma HYAL acts as endothelial glycocalyx shedding enzyme, sheddase. METHODS: Plasma hyaluronan, effective HYAL activity and HYAL inhibition were measured in healthy volunteers (n = 20), in patients with septic shock (n = 17, day 1 and day 4), in patients with acute pancreatitis (n = 7, day 1 and day 4) and in anesthetized and mechanically ventilated pigs (n = 16). Sixteen pigs were allocated (unblinded, open label) into three groups: Sepsis-1 with infusion of live Escherichia coli (E. coli) 1 × 10(8) CFU/h of 12 h (n = 5), Sepsis-2 with infusion of E. coli 1 × 10(8) CFU/h of 6 h followed by 1 × 10(9) CFU/h of the remaining 6 h (n = 5) or Control with no E. coli infusion (n = 6). RESULTS: In experimental E. coli porcine sepsis and in time controls, plasma hyaluronan increases with concomitant decrease in effective plasma HYAL activity and increase of endogenous HYAL inhibition. Plasma hyaluronan increased in patients with septic shock but not in acute pancreatitis. Effective plasma HYAL was lower in septic shock and acute pancreatitis as compared to healthy volunteers, while plasma HYAL inhibition was only increased in septic shock. CONCLUSION: Elevated plasma hyaluronan levels coincided with a concomitant decrease in effective plasma HYAL activity and increase of endogenous plasma HYAL inhibition both in experimental and clinical sepsis. In acute pancreatitis, effective plasma HYAL activity was decreased which was not associated with increased plasma hyaluronan concentrations or endogenous HYAL inhibition. The results suggest that plasma HYAL does not act as sheddase in sepsis or pancreatitis.

635113,The Success of ‘e-knee school’ for Knee Osteoarthritis During COVID 19; a Game- Changing Modality for the Future,2020-10-27,"Background: Epidemiologic studies of myalgic encephalomyelitis/ chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) have examined different aspects of this disease separately but few have explored them together. Objective: Describe ME/CFS onset and course in one United States-based cohort. Methods: One hundred and fifty subjects fitting Fukuda 1994 CFS criteria completed a detailed survey concerning the initial and subsequent stages of their illness. Descriptive statistics, graphs, and tables were used to illustrate prevalence and patterns of characteristics. Results: The most common peri-onset events reported by subjects were infection-related episodes (64%), stressful incidents (39%), and exposure to environmental toxins (20%). For 38% of subjects, more than 6 months elapsed from experiencing any initial symptom to developing the set of symptoms comprising their ME/CFS. Over time, the 12 most common symptoms persisted but declined in prevalence, with fatigue, unrefreshing sleep, exertion-related sickness, and flu-like symptoms declining the most (by 20–25%). Conversely, cognitive symptoms changed the least in prevalence, rising in symptom ranking. Pregnancy, menopause, and menstrual cycles exacerbated many women's symptoms. Fatigue-related function was not associated with duration of illness or age; during the worst periods of their illness, 48% of subjects could not engage in any productive activity. At the time of survey, 47% were unable to work and only 4% felt their condition was improving steadily with the majority (59%) describing a fluctuating course. Ninety-seven percent suffered from at least one other illness: anxiety (48%), depression (43%), fibromyalgia (39%), irritable bowel syndrome (38%), and migraine headaches (37%) were the most diagnosed conditions. Thirteen percent came from families where at least one other first-degree relative was also afflicted, rising to 27% when chronic fatigue of unclear etiology was included. Conclusions: This paper offers a broad epidemiologic overview of one ME/CFS cohort in the United States. While most of our findings are consistent with prior studies, we highlight underexamined aspects of this condition (e.g., the evolution of symptoms) and propose new interpretations of findings. Studying these aspects can offer insight and solutions to the diagnosis, etiology, pathophysiology, and treatment of this condition.","Chu, Lily; Valencia, Ian J.; Garvert, Donn W.; Montoya, Jose G.",Front Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805319/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2019.00012,597

635678,Radiographic Findings and other Predictors in Adults with Covid-19,2020-03-27,"Background: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was first described at the end of 2019 in China and has since spread across the globe. Red cell distribution width (RDW) is a potent prognostic marker in several medical conditions and has recently been suggested to be of prognostic value in COVID-19. Methods: This retrospective, observational study of consecutive patients with COVID-19 was conducted from March 12, 2020 to December 4, 2020 in the Wilhelminenhospital, Vienna, Austria. RDWlevels on admission were collected and tested for their predictive value of 28-day mortality. Results: A total of 423 eligible patients with COVID-19 were included in the final analyses and 15.4% died within 28 days (n = 65). Median levels of RDWwere significantly higher in non-survivors compared to survivors [14.6% (IQR, 13.7–16.3) vs. 13.4% (IQR, 12.7– 14.4), P < 0.001]. Increased RDW was a significant predictor of 28-day mortality [crude odds ratio (OR) 1.717, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.462–2.017; P = < 0.001], independent of clinical confounders, comorbidities and established prognostic markers of COVID-19 (adjusted OR of the final model 1.368, 95% CI 1.126–1.662; P = 0.002). This association remained consistent upon sub-group analysis. Our study data also demonstrate that RDW levels upon admission for COVID-19 were similar to previously recorded, non-COVID-19 associated RDW levels [14.2% (IQR, 13.3–15.7) vs. 14.0% [IQR, 13.2–15.1]; P = 0.187]. Conclusions: In this population, RDWwas a significant, independent prognostic marker of short-term mortality in patients with COVID-19.","Kaufmann, Christoph C.; Ahmed, Amro; Brunner, Ulrich; Jäger, Bernhard; Aicher, Gabriele; Equiluz-Bruck, Susanne; Spiel, Alexander O.; Funk, Georg-Christian; Gschwantler, Michael; Fasching, Peter; Huber, Kurt",Front Med (Lausanne),https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.652707; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33816532/,597
635832,Student Substance Use Policies in US Allopathic Medical Schools: A National Study.,2021-09-29,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility of a prehospital randomized controlled trial comparing transcutaneous pacing (TCP) with dopamine for unstable bradycardia. METHODS: Unstable bradycardic patients who failed to respond to a fluid bolus and up to 3 mg atropine were enrolled. The intervention was dopamine or TCP with crossover to dopamine if TCP failed. The primary outcome was survival to discharge or 30 days. Randomization compliance, safety, follow-up rates, primary outcome, and sample size requirements were assessed. RESULTS: Of 383 patients with unstable bradycardia, 151 (39%) failed to respond to atropine or fluid and were eligible for enrolment and 82 (55%) were correctly enrolled. Fifty-five (36%) of eligible patients could not be enrolled for practical reasons; 3 had advance directives, 32 met inclusion criteria on arrival at hospital and in 20 cases, paramedics chose not to enroll based on the circumstances of the case. The remaining 13 were missed cases; 8 were missing randomization envelopes and in 5, the paramedic forgot. Randomization compliance was 95% (78/82). Forty-two (51%) patients were randomized to TCP and seven of these crossed over to dopamine. Two cases were randomized but did not receive the intervention; either due to lack of time or loss of IV access. Three adverse events occurred in each group. Survival to discharge or 30 days in hospital was 70% (28/40) and 69% (29/42) in the dopamine and TCP groups, respectively with 100% follow up. To detect a 10% relative difference in 30 days survival between treatment arms, a sample size of 690 per group would be required. CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to conduct a prehospital randomized controlled trial of TCP for unstable bradycardia and a definitive trial would require a multi-centre study.","Morrison, Laurie J.; Long, Jennifer; Vermeulen, Marian; Schwartz, Brian; Sawadsky, Bruce; Frank, Jamie; Cameron, Bruce; Burgess, Robert; Shield, Jennifer; Bagley, Paul; Mausz, Vivien; Brewer, James E.; Dorian, Paul",Resuscitation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17933452/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0300957207004418; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300957207004418,597
636150,Reduction in nosocomial infections during the COVID-19 era: a lesson to be learned,2020-11-19,"IMPORTANCE: Black patients are overrepresented in the number of COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and deaths in the US. Reasons for this disparity may be due to underlying comorbidities or sociodemographic factors that require further exploration. OBJECTIVE: To systematically determine patient characteristics associated with racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study used comparative groups of patients tested or treated for COVID-19 at the University of Michigan from March 10, 2020, to April 22, 2020, with an outcome update through July 28, 2020. A group of randomly selected untested individuals were included for comparison. Examined factors included race/ethnicity, age, smoking, alcohol consumption, comorbidities, body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), and residential-level socioeconomic characteristics. EXPOSURE: In-house polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, commercial antibody tests, nasopharynx or oropharynx PCR deployed by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and reverse transcription–PCR tests performed in external labs. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcomes were being tested for COVID-19, having test results positive for COVID-19 or being diagnosed with COVID-19, being hospitalized for COVID-19, requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission for COVID-19, and COVID-19–related mortality (including inpatient and outpatient). Medical comorbidities were defined from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, codes and were aggregated into a comorbidity score. Associations with COVID-19 outcomes were examined using odds ratios (ORs). RESULTS: Of 5698 patients tested for COVID-19 (mean [SD] age, 47.4 [20.9] years; 2167 [38.0%] men; mean [SD] BMI, 30.0 [8.0]), most were non-Hispanic White (3740 patients [65.6%]) or non-Hispanic Black (1058 patients [18.6%]). The comparison group included 7168 individuals who were not tested (mean [SD] age, 43.1 [24.1] years; 3257 [45.4%] men; mean [SD] BMI, 28.5 [7.1]). Among 1139 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 492 (43.2%) were White and 442 (38.8%) were Black; 523 (45.9%) were hospitalized, 283 (24.7%) were admitted to the ICU, and 88 (7.7%) died. Adjusting for age, sex, socioeconomic status, and comorbidity score, Black patients were more likely to be hospitalized compared with White patients (OR, 1.72 [95% CI, 1.15-2.58]; P = .009). In addition to older age, male sex, and obesity, living in densely populated areas was associated with increased risk of hospitalization (OR, 1.10 [95% CI, 1.01-1.19]; P = .02). In the overall population, higher risk of hospitalization was also observed in patients with preexisting type 2 diabetes (OR, 1.82 [95% CI, 1.25-2.64]; P = .02) and kidney disease (OR, 2.87 [95% CI, 1.87-4.42]; P < .001). Compared with White patients, obesity was associated with higher risk of having test results positive for COVID-19 among Black patients (White: OR, 1.37 [95% CI, 1.01-1.84]; P = .04. Black: OR, 3.11 [95% CI, 1.64-5.90]; P < .001; P for interaction = .02). Having any cancer was associated with higher risk of positive COVID-19 test results for Black patients (OR, 1.82 [95% CI, 1.19-2.78]; P = .005) but not White patients (OR, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.84-1.40]; P = .53; P for interaction = .04). Overall comorbidity burden was associated with higher risk of hospitalization in White patients (OR, 1.30 [95% CI, 1.11-1.53]; P = .001) but not in Black patients (OR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.83-1.17]; P = .88; P for interaction = .02), as was type 2 diabetes (White: OR, 2.59 [95% CI, 1.49-4.48]; P < .001; Black: OR, 1.17 [95% CI, 0.66-2.06]; P = .59; P for interaction = .046). No statistically significant racial differences were found in ICU admission and mortality based on adjusted analysis. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that preexisting type 2 diabetes or kidney diseases and living in high–population density areas were associated with higher risk for COVID-19 hospitalization.

636225,Healthcare delivery via telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic: The experience of a Huntington’s disease clinic,2021-04-20,"BACKGROUND: Priority setting is one of the most difficult issues facing hospitals because of funding restrictions and changing patient need. A deadly communicable disease outbreak, such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Toronto in 2003, amplifies the difficulties of hospital priority setting. The purpose of this study is to describe and evaluate priority setting in a hospital in response to SARS using the ethical framework 'accountability for reasonableness'. METHODS: This study was conducted at a large tertiary hospital in Toronto, Canada. There were two data sources: 1) over 200 key documents (e.g. emails, bulletins), and 2) 35 interviews with key informants. Analysis used a modified thematic technique in three phases: open coding, axial coding, and evaluation. RESULTS: Participants described the types of priority setting decisions, the decision making process and the reasoning used. Although the hospital leadership made an effort to meet the conditions of 'accountability for reasonableness', they acknowledged that the decision making was not ideal. We described good practices and opportunities for improvement. CONCLUSIONS: 'Accountability for reasonableness' is a framework that can be used to guide fair priority setting in health care organizations, such as hospitals. In the midst of a crisis such as SARS where guidance is incomplete, consequences uncertain, and information constantly changing, where hour-by-hour decisions involve life and death, fairness is more important rather than less.","Bell, Jennifer AH; Hyland, Sylvia; DePellegrin, Tania; Upshur, Ross EG; Bernstein, Mark; Martin, Douglas K",BMC Health Serv Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15606924/,597

Mechanisms underlying the recognized association between ecosystem health and human health remain poorly understood and responding appropriately to the ecological, social and economic conditions that facilitate disease emergence and transmission represents a substantial societal challenge. In the context of disease emergence from wildlife, wildlife and habitat should be conserved, which in turn will preserve vital ecosystem structure and function, which has broader implications for human wellbeing and environmental sustainability, while simultaneously minimizing the spillover of pathogens from wild animals into human beings. In this review, we propose a novel framework for the holistic and interdisciplinary investigation of zoonotic disease emergence and its drivers, using the spillover of bat pathogens as a case study.

Its rapid dissemination and serious course require a novel approach to healthcare practices. Severe disease progression is often associated with the development of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and may require some form of respiratory support, including endotracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation, and enteral nutrition through a nasogastric tube. These conditions increase the risk of dysphagia, aspiration, and aspiration pneumonia. The data on the incidence and risks of dysphagia associated with COVID-19 are not yet available. However, it is assumed that these patients are at high risk, because of respiratory symptoms and reduced lung function. These findings may exacerbate swallowing deficits.

METHODS: Trained qualitative researchers conducted a total of 48 hours of observation in 3 public tertiary care hospitals and 12 in-depth interviews with family caregivers. RESULTS: Family caregivers provided care 24 hours a day, including bedside nursing, cleaning care, and psychologic support. During observations, family members provided 2,065 episodes of care giving, 75% (1,544) of which involved close contact with patients. We observed family caregivers washing their hands with soap on only 4 occasions. The majority of respondents said diseases are transmitted through physical contact with surfaces and objects that have been contaminated with patient secretions and excretions, and avoiding contact with these contaminated objects would help prevent disease. CONCLUSION: Family caregivers are at risk for hospital-acquired infection from their repeated exposure to infectious agents combined with their inadequate hand hygiene and knowledge about disease transmission. Future research should explore potential strategies to improve family caregivers’ knowledge about disease transmission and reduce family caregiver exposures, which may be accomplished by improving care provided by health care workers.","Islam, M.

However, due to low viral load in some COVID-19 patients, false negative results from this method have been repeatedly reported. METHOD: In this study, we compared the sensitivity and specificity of digital PCR (dPCR) in simulated samples and clinical samples with qPCR assay through a series of vigorous tests. RESULTS: The results showed that dPCR was more sensitive than qPCR especially for samples with low viral load (≤3 copies). In addition, dPCR had similar specificity as qPCR and could effectively distinguish other human coronaviruses and influenza virus from SARS-CoV-2. More importantly, dPCR was more sensitive than qPCR in detecting the virus in the “negative” samples from recurrent COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, dPCR could serve as a powerful complement to the current qPCR method for SARS-CoV-2 detection, especially for the samples with extremely low viral load, such as recurrent COVID-19 patients.","Sun, Yong; Ding, Chengchao; Chen, Qingqing; Xie, Jiajia; Yu, Junling; Shi, Yonglin; Jiang, Chengcheng; Zhang, Zhuhui; He, Hongliang; Ge, Yinglu; Li, Wenting; He, Jun; Gao, Yong",J Virol Methods,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34051244/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2021.114185; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093421001245?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093421001245,597

Study Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods We conducted a systematic search on PubMed/LitCovid, Scopus, and Web of Sciences databases for papers in the English language only, up to 1 January 2021. We used the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist developed for cross-sectional studies to appraise the quality of the included studies. All stages of the review conducted by two independent reviewers and potential discrepancies were solved with a consultation with a third reviewer. We reported the result as number and percentage. A meta-analysis conducted using a random effect model with a 95% confidence interval. Results Forty-eight studies encompassing 76848 participants were included in this review. 56.53% of the participants were female. The mean age of the participants was 33.7 years. 85.42% of the included studies were scored as good quality, 12.50% as fair quality, and the remaining (2.08%) as low quality. 87.5% examined all three components of the KAPs model. The knowledge component was reported as good, and poor in 89.5%, and 10.5% of the included studies, respectively. Of the studies that examined the attitude component, 100% reported a positive attitude. For the practice component, 93.2% reported satisfactory practice, and 6.8% poor practice. The result of the meta-analysis showed that the overall score of KAPs components about COVID-19 were 78.9, 79.8, and 74.1, respectively. Conclusions This systematic review and meta-analysis showed that the overall KAP components in the included studies were at an acceptable level. In general, knowledge was at a good level, the attitude was positive and practice was at a satisfactory level. Using an integrated international system can help better evaluate these components and compare them between countries.","Saadatjoo, Saeede; Miri, Maryam; Hassanipour, Soheil; Ameri, Hosein; Arab-Zozani, Morteza",Public Health,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033350621001141?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033350621001141; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33962095/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2021.03.005,597

The aim of this report is to describe how COVID-19 affected the life and organization of one of the main orthopaedic hospitals of the country, and which measures were implemented to face the outbreak. METHODS: A personal interview has been conducted with four doctors involved in the management of COVID-19 outbreak in one of the main orthopaedic hospitals of Italy. RESULTS: Hospital was re-organized, elective surgeries were cancelled, and only trauma surgeries were allowed, together with oncologic and urgent cases. Since the number of cases among patients and healthcare workers increased, the hospital management responded not only with a massive testing campaign aimed at detecting contact histories but also with an additional testing campaign for asymptomatic healthcare workers.

A significant proportion of adult patients require hospitalisation and may develop severe life-threatening complications. Children, on the other hand, can carry and transmit the virus, but usually do not develop severe disease. Mortality in the paediatric age-group is relatively low. Differences in virus containment and clearance, as well as reduced inflammation-related tissue and organ damage may be caused by age-specific environmental and host factors. Since severe complications in adults are frequently caused by uncontrolled immune responses and a resulting “cytokine storm” that may be controlled by targeted blockade of cytokines, previously established treatment with immunosuppressive treatments may indeed protect children from complications.","Hedrich, Christian M.",Clin Immunol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clim.2020.108420; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32283324/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S152166162030259X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S152166162030259X,597

We identified an unexpected antagonistic effect of FGFs on the interferon (IFN) signaling pathway. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of FGF receptor signaling in keratinocytes promoted the expression of interferon‐stimulated genes (ISG) and proteins in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, FGF7 or FGF10 treatment of keratinocytes suppressed ISG expression under homeostatic conditions and in response to IFN or poly(I:C) treatment. FGF‐mediated ISG suppression was independent of IFN receptors, occurred at the transcriptional level, and required FGF receptor kinase and proteasomal activity. It is not restricted to keratinocytes and functionally relevant, since FGFs promoted the replication of herpes simplex virus I (HSV‐1), lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, and Zika virus. Most importantly, inhibition of FGFR signaling blocked HSV‐1 replication in cultured human keratinocytes and in mice. These results suggest the use of FGFR kinase inhibitors for the treatment of viral infections.","Maddaluno, Luigi; Urwyler, Corinne; Rauschendorfer, Theresa; Meyer, Michael; Stefanova, Debora; Spörri, Roman; Wietecha, Mateusz; Ferrarese, Luca; Stoycheva, Diana; Bender, Daniela; Li, Nick; Strittmatter, Gerhard; Nasirujjaman, Khondokar; Beer, Hans‐Dietmar; Staeheli, Peter; Hildt, Eberhard; Oxenius, Annette; Werner, Sabine",EMBO Mol Med,https://doi.org/10.15252/emmm.201911793; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32720440/,597

This study sought to determine the perceived value of virtual interviews for Pediatric Surgery Fellowship. METHODS: An anonymous survey was distributed to the applicants and faculty at a university-affiliated, free-standing children’s hospital with a Pediatric Surgery fellowship program that conducted one of three interview days using a virtual format. RESULTS: All applicants who responded to the survey had at least one interview that was converted to a virtual interview. Faculty (75%) and applicants (87.5%) preferred in-person interviews over virtual interviews; most applicants (57%) did not feel they got to know the program as well with the virtual format. Applicants and faculty felt that virtual interviews could potentially be used as a screening tool in the future (7/10 Likert) but did not recommend they be used as a complete replacement for in-person interviews (3.5-5/10 Likert). Applicants were more likely than faculty to report that interview type influenced their final rank list (5 vs 3/10 Likert). CONCLUSION: Faculty and applicants preferred in-person interviews and did not recommend that virtual interviews replace in-person interviews.

The current study aims to investigate the acute and long-term effects of COVID-19 disease on (1) the desire for food, hunger, and satiety sensations; (2) smell, taste, and flavour perception; (3) meals and intake of food types; and (4) the frequency of commonly applied strategies to tackle potential changes in appetite and sensory perception. An online survey was conducted among Danish adults (n = 102) who had experienced changes in appetite, sensory perception, and/or food-related pleasure due to COVID-19 disease. Key results include appetite-altering effects at all times during the day when suffering from COVID-19 and often associated with impaired sensory function. Severe sensory perception alterations were found, namely, for the perception of taste, ageusia > hypogeusia > hypergeusia, and for the perception of smell, anosmia > parosmia > hyposmia > hyperosmia. Eating behavioural changes included alteration in quantitative and qualitative aspects of intake. The effects were, in general, more pronounced during the acute phase of disease than during the post-acute phase. The findings illustrate the complexity by which COVID-19 affects human appetite, sensory perception, and eating behaviour, but also point to strategies to cope with these changes.","Chaaban, Nora; Høier, Alexander Teymour Zadeh Baboli; Andersen, Barbara Vad",Foods,https://doi.org/10.3390/foods10040892; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33921603/,597

All Iranian provinces are now affected, although to a different extent. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the distance from the epicenter of the infection (Qom) or demographic factors such as population density and the ratio of the elderly population are associated with the incidence of COVID-19 in different Iranian provinces. For the purpose of determining whether the distance from the virus epicenter could be associated with the spread of infection, linear regression analysis was performed using STATA 12.0 software. The association of the incidence of COVID-19 with the population density and the ratio of the population over 65 years old in 31 Iranian provinces was also evaluated. According to our results, a strong association was found between the incidence of COVID-19 in Iranian provinces and their respective distance from Qom (p < 0.001; C = -0.68). The incidence of COVID-19 in Iranian provinces was also positively associated with the ratio of the population over 65 years old (p = 0.002; C = 0.53), while no significant association with population density was found (p = 0.39; C = 0.16). These results suggest that the implementation of travel restrictions from highly affected areas to other provinces could considerably reduce the rate of transmission of the disease throughout the country. Also, provinces with a higher proportion of elderly people (over 65) were identified as particularly at risk for the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections. These results will contribute to better management of the COVID-19 outbreak in Iran, taking into account demographic and geographic characteristics of different provinces.","Dadar, Maryam; Fakhri, Yadolah; Bjørklund, Geir; Shahali, Youcef",Arch Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32880019/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-020-04774-5,597

This study aims to explore the desired content, format and delivery characteristics of a potential educational, context-specific Southern African EM podcast, by investigating current podcast usages, trends and preferences among Southern African EM registrars of varying seniority. METHODS: We developed an electronic survey - using a combination of existing literature, context-specific specialist-training guidance, and input from local experts – exploring preferred podcast characteristics among EM registrars from four Southern African universities. RESULTS: The study's response rate was 75%, with 24 of the 39 respondents being junior registrars. Ninety-four percent (94%) of respondents used EM podcasts as an educational medium: 64% predominantly using podcasts to supplement a personal EM study program. The primary mode of accessing podcasts was via personal mobile devices (84%). Additionally, respondents preferred a shorter podcast duration (5–15 min), favoured multimedia podcasts (56%) and showed an apparent aversion toward recorded faculty lectures (5%). Eighty-two percent (82%) of respondents preferred context-specific podcast content, with popular topics including toxicology (95%), cardiovascular emergencies (79%) and medico-legal matters (74%). Just-in-Time learning proved an unpopular learning strategy in our study population, despite its substantial educational value. CONCLUSION: Podcast-usage proved to be near-ubiquitous among the studied Southern African EM registrars. Quintessentially, future context-specific podcast design should cater for mobile device-use, shorter duration podcasts, more video content, context-specific topics, and content optimised for both Just-in-Time learning.","Ekambaram, K.; Lamprecht, H.; Lalloo, V.; Caruso, N.; Engelbrecht, A.; Jooste, W.",Afr J Emerg Med,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.afjem.2020.10.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33318911/,597

643154,The differential impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on Medicaid expansion and non-expansion states,2021-02-25,"Objectives: As of June 1, 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a global pandemic and resulted in over 370,000 deaths worldwide. Early identification of COVID-19 patients who need to be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) helps to improve the outcomes. We aim to investigate whether absolute eosinophil count (AEC) can predict ICU transfer among elderly COVID-19 patients from general isolation wards. Methods: A retrospective study of 94 elderly patients older than 60 years old with COVID-19 was conducted. We compared the basic clinical characteristics and levels of inflammation markers on admission to general isolation wards and the needs for ICU transfer between the eosinopenia (AEC on admission <20 cells/μl) and non-eosinopenia (AEC ≥20 cells/μl) groups. Results: There was a significantly higher ICU transfer rate in the eosinopenia group than in the non-eosinopenia group (51 vs. 9%, P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that eosinopenia was associated with an increased risk of ICU transfer in elderly COVID-19 patients [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 6.12 (95% CI, 1.23–30.33), P = 0.027] after adjustment of age, lymphocyte count, neutrophil count, C-reactive protein (CRP), and ferritin levels. The eosinopenia group had higher levels of CRP, ferritin, and cytokines [interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)] than the non-eosinophil group (P < 0.001). The area under the curve of AEC on admission for predicting ICU transfer among elderly COVID-19 patients was 0.828 (95% CI, 0.732–0.923). The best cut-off value of AEC was 25 cells/μl with a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 71%, respectively. Conclusion: Absolute eosinophil count on admission is a valid predictive marker for ICU transfer among elderly COVID-19 patients from general isolation wards and, therefore, can help case triage and optimize ICU utilization, especially for health care facilities with limited ICU capacity.","Huang, Jinjin; Zhang, Zhicheng; Liu, Shunfang; Gong, Chen; Chen, Liping; Ai, Guo; Zhu, Xiaodong; Zhang, Chunli; Li, Dengju",Front Med (Lausanne),https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2020.585222; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33251234/,597

We aimed to examine experiences of university students and staff of regular asymptomatic self-testing using LFTs, and their subsequent behaviours. DESIGN AND SETTING: A qualitative study using semistructured remote interviews and qualitative survey responses, which were analysed thematically. PARTICIPANTS: People who were participating in weekly testing feasibility study, between October 2020 and January 2021, at the University of Oxford. RESULTS: We interviewed 18 and surveyed 214 participants. Participants were motivated to regularly self-test as they wanted to know whether or not they were infected with SARS-CoV-2. Most reported that a negative test result did not change their behaviour, but it did provide them with reassurance to engage with permitted activities. In contrast, some participants reported making decisions about visiting other people because they felt reassured by a negative test result. Participants valued the training but some still doubted their ability to carry out the test. Participants were concerned about safety of attending test sites with lots of people and reported home testing was most convenient. CONCLUSIONS: Clear messages highlighting the benefits of regular testing for family, friends and society in identifying asymptomatic cases are needed. This should be coupled with transparent communication about the accuracy of LFTs and how to act on either a positive or negative result. Concerns about safety, convenience of testing and ability to do tests need to be addressed to ensure successful scaling up of asymptomatic testing.","Wanat, Marta; Logan, Mary; Hirst, Jennifer A; Vicary, Charles; Lee, Joseph J; Perera, Rafael; Tracey, Irene; Duff, Gordon; Tufano, Peter; Fanshawe, Thomas; Mwandigha, Lazaro; Nicholson, Brian D; Tonkin-Crine, Sarah; Hobbs, Richard",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34475190/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-053850,597

These tests are often used in the management of chronic disease, such as blood sugar, hemoglobin A1c and lipid levels, but can also be used for acute conditions such as influenza infection and group A streptococcus pharyngitis. When used for these acute infections, point-of-care tests can allow for pharmacist-initiated treatment. In this study, an influenza point-of-care testing service was developed and implemented in a chain community pharmacy setting and a retrospective review was conducted to assess the service. Of patients tested, 29% tested positive for influenza A and/or B; 92% of patients testing positive received a prescription as a result. While health insurance cannot be billed for the service due to current pharmacy reimbursement practices, this did not appear to negatively affect patient willingness to participate. As point-of-care testing services become more commonplace in community pharmacy settings, patient awareness will similarly increase and allow for more widespread access to acute outpatient care.","Hardin, Rachel; Roberts, Pheli; Hudspeth, Brooke; Tracy, Angela; Baldwin, Lauren; Raque, Michael; Kebodeaux, Clark D.",Pharmacy (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33036133/; https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmacy8040182,597

Adjusted Ct values and estimated VL for asymptomatic versus symptomatic children (118 asymptomatic versus 197 symptomatic children aged 0 to 4 years, 79 asymptomatic versus 97 symptomatic children aged 5 to 9 years, 69 asymptomatic versus 75 symptomatic children aged 10 to 13 years, 73 asymptomatic versus 109 symptomatic children aged 14 to 17 years) were compared. The median adjusted Ct value for asymptomatic children was 10.3 cycles higher than for symptomatic children (P < 0.0001), and VL were 3 to 4 logs lower than for symptomatic children (P < 0.0001); differences were consistent (P < 0.0001) across all four age brackets. These differences were consistent across all institutions and by sex, ethnicity, and race. Asymptomatic children with diabetes (odds ratio [OR], 6.5; P = 0.01), a recent contact (OR, 2.3; P = 0.02), and testing for surveillance (OR, 2.7; P = 0.005) had higher estimated risks of having a Ct value in the lowest quartile than children without, while an immunocompromised status had no effect. Children with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection had lower levels of virus in their nasopharynx/oropharynx than symptomatic children, but the timing of infection relative to diagnosis likely impacted levels in asymptomatic children. Caution is recommended when choosing diagnostic tests for screening of asymptomatic children.","Kociolek, Larry K.; Muller, William J.; Yee, Rebecca; Dien Bard, Jennifer; Brown, Cameron A.; Revell, Paula A.; Wardell, Hanna; Savage, Timothy J.; Jung, Sarah; Dominguez, Samuel; Parikh, Bijal A.; Jerris, Robert C.; Kehl, Sue C.; Campigotto, Aaron; Bender, Jeffrey M.; Zheng, Xiaotian; Muscat, Emily; Linam, Matthew; Abuogi, Lisa; Smith, Christiana; Graff, Kelly; Hernandez-Leyva, Ariel; Williams, David; Pollock, Nira R.",J Clin Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33093026/; https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.02593-20,597

We use the string ‘will I die from coronavirus’ on GT as the measure for people’s level of distress regarding Covid-19. We also test whether concern for coronavirus is a partisan issue by contrasting GT data and 2016 election results.

The rational development of drugs critically depends on our understanding of disease mechanisms, that is, the physiology and pathophysiology underlying the function of the organ targeted by the virus. Since the beginning of the pandemic, tireless efforts around the globe have led to numerous publications on the virus, its receptor, its entry into the cell, its cytopathic effects, and how it triggers innate and native immunity but the role of apical sodium transport mediated by the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) during the early phases of the infection in the airways has received little attention.

To achieve this, we analyze the daily reports on the pandemic issued by the Mexican Ministry of Health, using the framework of mathematical competencies as a theoretical lens. Our results show that there are five necessary competencies to interpret the official information: mathematical communication, mathematical representation, mathematical symbols and formalism, mathematical modeling, and mathematical reasoning competency.

It is therefore necessary to have a rapid diagnostic test that differentiates between the different causes of infectious conjunctivitis. Screening clinical samples by sample type/syndrome based multiplex real time PCR would allow for rapid detection of a variety of pathogens simultaneously, which will in turn aid in the treatment and clinical management of the patient. A multiplex real-time PCR assay for rapid and simultaneous detection of HSV 1 and 2, VZV, adenovirus and Chlamydia trachomatis (C. trachomatis) from eye swabs was developed and evaluated. The multiplex assay was shown to be sensitive, specific and robust.

However, few researchers have incorporated this kind of waning effect into their virus spread models. In this study, we simulate an influenza epidemic that considers the effects of waning immunity by fitting epidemiological models to CDC secondary historical data aggregated on a weekly basis, and derive the transmission rates at which susceptible individuals become infected over the course of the influenza season. Using a system of differential equations, we define four groups of individuals in a population: susceptible, vaccinated, infected, and recovered. We show that a larger number of initially infected individuals might not only bring the influenza season to an end sooner but also reduce the epidemic size. Moreover, any influenza virus that entails a faster recovery rate does not necessarily lead to a smaller epidemic size. We illustrate how simulation helps in understanding the effects of influenza epidemiological model in the presence of waning influenza vaccine immunity.","Chen, Chun-Miin (Jimmy); Stanciu, Alia C.",Medicine (Baltimore),https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000027169; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34516511/,597

In this study, we describe a hospital‐based epidemiological study of hMPV in patients presenting to a children's hospital and show the demographic and clinical characteristics associated with hMPV infection in China, retrospectively. Specimens were collected over a 2‐year period from children hospitalized with acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRTI) and analyzed for the presence of hMPV using real‐time RT‐PCR assays. The presence of hMPV was detected in 227 (25.9%) of the 878 children studied and may circulate year‐round in the area, peaking during the winter–spring season. Younger children (aged less than 6 months) had the highest positive rate. Infections by hMPV showed similar epidemiology and clinical manifestations as for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and were found in high co‐infections with RSV. Subgroup A2 hMPV was the most predominant genotype identified during the study period. This study indicates that hMPV is one of the major respiratory pathogens found in children in southwest China and vaccine development should be under consideration. Pediatr.

OUTCOME MEASURES Growth of any bacteria or fungi, or positive polymerase chain reaction results for common respiratory viruses and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) RESULTS 25 PAPR hoods were swabbed; ten (40%) returned positive results. Bacterial growth was detected on six hoods (bacillus simplex, kocuria rhizophilia, bacillus weihenstephensis, microcccus luteus and staphylococcus epidermidis); five of the hoods were positive for fungal growth (non-sporulating environmental mould, NSEM); all sampled hoods tested negative for both SARS-CoV-2 and an expanded panel of respiratory viruses. There was wide variation in the storage of cleaned hoods. CONCLUSION Despite following recommended cleaning procedures, bacteria and fungi can remain on the internal components of PAPR hoods, at levels significant enough to be swabbed and cultured. PAPR hoods have the potential to cross-infect wearers and patients and are used primarily by clinicians who fail to fit disposable FFP3 respirators; the female sex and non-Caucasian people are less likely to fit FFP3 respirators. The hoods tested cannot be adequately cleaned for use in high risk healthcare environments, PAPR hoods and tubes can act as fomites, and there are evident shortcomings in their provision.","Chakladar, A.; Jones, C.

The aim of this study (clinicaltrials.gov NCT 0430818) was to evaluate the impact of both perceived stress aroused by Covid-19 and of emotions triggered by the lockdown situation on the individual experience of time. A large sample of the French population responded to a survey on their experience of the passage of time during the lockdown compared to before the lockdown. The perceived stress resulting from Covid-19 and stress at work and home were also assessed, as were the emotions felt. The results showed that people have experienced a slowing down of time during the lockdown. This time experience was not explained by the levels of perceived stress or anxiety, although these were considerable, but rather by the increase in boredom and sadness felt in the lockdown situation. The increased anger and fear of death only explained a small part of variance in the time judgment. The conscious experience of time therefore reflected the psychological difficulties experienced during lockdown and was not related to their perceived level of stress or anxiety.","Droit-Volet, Sylvie; Gil, Sandrine; Martinelli, Natalia; Andant, Nicolas; Clinchamps, Maélys; Parreira, Lénise; Rouffiac, Karine; Dambrun, Michael; Huguet, Pascal; Dubuis, Benoît; Pereira, Bruno; Bouillon, Jean-Baptiste; Dutheil, Frédéric",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32776990/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0236465,597

Methods: We collected the clinical data of 24 patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 who were admitted to the isolation ward of the First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College from January, 2020 to February 20, 2020, and evaluated the data of clinical characteristics, blood test results, inflammatory index, chest CT imaging characteristics, and antiviral treatment, comparing this with the clinical data of 41 patients with moderate condition in the same period. From this comparison we thus summarized the current knowledge of potential risk factors for COVID-19 patients developing from moderate to severe condition. Results: (1) Clinical characteristics: The moderate-to-severe group and the moderate group in terms of combined common underlying diseases and respiratory frequency showed significant difference statistically (t-value were 13.32, 6.17, respectively, P < 0.05), while no significant difference between the two groups in gender, age, or clinical symptoms was statistically observed(P > 0.05). (2) Analysis of blood test results: The lymphocyte count and plasma albumin of the moderate-to-severe group were significantly lower than those of the moderate group (t-values were 4.16, 4.11, respectively, P < 0.05), and the blood glucose and urea of the moderate-to-severe group were significantly higher than those of the moderate group (t-value were 3.27, 4.19, respectively, P < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference in terms of white blood cell count (WBC), platelet count (PLT), and glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT) (P > 0.05). (3) Comparison of inflammatory indicators: The level of IL-6 and CRP of the moderate-to-severe group were significantly higher than those of the moderate group (t-values were 2.84, 4.88, respectively, P < 0.05). (4) Imaging comparison: As for patients with moderate COVID-19, the imaging manifestations were the concurrence of ground-glass opacity, patchy shadow, and consolidation shadow in both lungs, diffuse ground-glass opacity in both lungs accompanied by air bronchogram, and large area consolidation of both lungs with pulmonary interstitial changes. The possibility for these patients to develop into severe condition increased, and the differences were statistically significant (t = 10.92, P < 0.05). (5) Clinical antiviral treatment: There was no statistically significant difference in the combination of two or three antiviral drugs between the two groups (χ(2) = 0.05, P > 0.05). Conclusion: Current evidence suggested that the combination of common underlying diseases, respiratory frequency, lymphocyte count, blood glucose, albumin, urea level, inflammatory factors (CRP, IL-6), and imaging manifestations collectively contributed to the potential risk factors for the development of COVID-19 from moderate condition to severe condition. Particular attention should be paid to early detection and intervention during clinical work, which will be of vital significance to the ascent of the recovery rate as well as the reduction of mortality.","Li, Dianming; Liu, Chuanmiao; Liu, Jiahui; Hu, Junfeng; Yang, Yanli; Zhou, Yufu",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33042873/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2020.548582,597

DATA SOURCES: We reviewed available databases and searched systematically for publications. To be taken into account, data had to be broken down by gender. There was no study evaluation nor quantification synthesis, due to the large heterogeneity of the studies. Nineteen databases were selected. 73 publications were considered and 33 were selected, to which 12 more were added. RESULTS: Globally, the proportion of men and women who tested positive is comparable. However, men are about 60% more likely to be severely ill or to die from the complications of Covid-19 than are women. LIMITATIONS: The study was hampered by a large heterogeneity in testing and reporting of the data. CONCLUSIONS: Although in the pandemic men die more frequently than women from Covid-19, it is not clear whether this is due to biological differences between men and women, differences in behavioral habits, or differences in the rates of co-morbidities. IMPLICATIONS OF KEY FINDINGS: Countries and studies should report their data by age, gender and co-morbidities.

Introduction: Cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis have been reported in individuals vaccinated against COVID-19 with non-replicating adenoviral vector vaccines. We issue our recommendations on the diagnosis and management of patients presenting this complication. Methods: The multidisciplinary working group, led by the Spanish Federation of Medical and Scientific Associations (FACME) and including representatives of several scientific societies, reviewed the available evidence from the literature and reports of the European Medicines Agency. We establish a definition for suspected cases and issue diagnostic and treatment recommendations regarding vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopaenia. Results: We define suspected cases as those cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis occurring between 3 and 21 days after the administration of non-replicating adenoviral vector vaccines, in patients with a platelet count below 150 000/μL or presenting a decrease of 50% with respect to the previous value. Findings suggestive of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopaenia include the presence of antibodies to platelet factor 4, D-dimer levels 4 times greater than the upper limit of normal, and unexplained thrombosis. The recommended treatment includes intravenous administration of non-specific human immunoglobulin or alternatively plasmapheresis, avoiding the use of heparin, instead employing argatroban, bivalirudin, fondaparinux, rivaroxaban, or apixaban for anticoagulation, and avoiding platelet transfusion. Conclusions: Non-replicating adenoviral vector vaccines may be associated with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis with thrombocytopaenia; it is important to treat the dysimmune phenomenon and the cerebral venous sinus thrombosis.","Avendaño-Solá, Cristina; Cámara, Rafael de la; Castellanos, Mar; Ezpeleta, David; García-Azorín, David; Martínez, Cristina Iñiguez; Lecumberri, Ramón; Marti de Gracia, Milagros; Margüello, Esther Redondo; Rovira, Alex; Sancho-López, Aránzazu; Garrido, Pilar",Neurologia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34049738/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nrl.2021.05.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0213485321000839?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0213485321000839,597

647834,Can COVID 19 Present like appendicitis?,2020-06-02,"Direct RNA sequencing using an Oxford Nanopore MinION characterised the transcriptome of SARS-CoV-2 grown in Vero E6 cells. This cell line is being widely used to propagate the novel coronavirus. The viral transcriptome was analysed using a recently developed ORF-centric pipeline. This revealed the pattern of viral transcripts, (i.e. subgenomic mRNAs), generally fitted the predicted replication and transcription model for coronaviruses. A 24 nt in-frame deletion was detected in subgenomic mRNAs encoding the spike (S) glycoprotein. This feature was identified in over half of the mapped transcripts and was predicted to remove a proposed furin cleavage site from the S glycoprotein. This motif directs cleavage of the S glycoprotein into functional subunits during virus entry or exit. Cleavage of the S glycoprotein can be a barrier to zoonotic coronavirus transmission and affect viral pathogenicity. Allied to this transcriptome analysis, tandem mass spectrometry was used to identify over 500 viral peptides and 44 phosphopeptides, covering almost all of the proteins predicted to be encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome, including peptides unique to the deleted variant of the S glycoprotein. Detection of an apparently viable deletion in the furin cleavage site of the S glycoprotein reinforces the point that this and other regions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins may readily mutate. This is of clear significance given the interest in the S glycoprotein as a potential vaccine target and the observation that the furin cleavage site likely contributes strongly to the pathogenesis and zoonosis of this virus. The viral genome sequence should be carefully monitored during the growth of viral stocks for research, animal challenge models and, potentially, in clinical samples. Such variations may result in different levels of virulence, morbidity and mortality.","Davidson, Andrew D.; Williamson, Maia Kavanagh; Lewis, Sebastian; Shoemark, Deborah; Carroll, Miles W.; Heesom, Kate; Zambon, Maria; Ellis, Joanna; Lewis, Phillip A.; Hiscox, Julian A.; Matthews, David A.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.22.002204,597

648675,Biologic drugs during COVID‐19 outbreak,2020-08-06,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the agent of a major global outbreak of respiratory tract disease known as coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 infects the lungs and may cause several immune-related complications such as lymphocytopenia and cytokine storm which are associated with the severity of the disease and predict mortality . The mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may result in immune system dysfunction is not fully understood. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 infects human CD4+ T helper cells, but not CD8+ T cells, and is present in blood and bronchoalveolar lavage T helper cells of severe COVID-19 patients. We demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S) directly binds to the CD4 molecule, which in turn mediates the entry of SARS- CoV-2 in T helper cells in a mechanism that also requires ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Once inside T helper cells, SARS-CoV-2 assembles viral factories, impairs cell function and may cause cell death. SARS-CoV-2 infected T helper cells express higher amounts of IL-10, which is associated with viral persistence and disease severity. Thus, CD4-mediated SARS-CoV-2 infection of T helper cells may explain the poor adaptive immune response of many COVID- 19 patients.","Davanzo, G. G.; Codo, A. C.; Brunetti, N. S.; Boldrini, V.

648773,Replicating the Kerala State's Successful COVID-19 Containment Model: Insights on What Worked,2020-09-01,"Recent reports suggest that high‐altitude residence may be beneficial in the novel coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) implicating that traveling to high places or using hypoxic conditioning thus could be favorable as well. Physiological high‐altitude characteristics and symptoms of altitude illnesses furthermore seem similar to several pathologies associated with COVID‐19. As a consequence, high altitude and hypoxia research and related clinical practices are discussed for potential applications in COVID‐19 prevention and treatment. We summarize the currently available evidence on the relationship between altitude/hypoxia conditions and COVID‐19 epidemiology and pathophysiology. The potential for treatment strategies used for altitude illnesses is evaluated. Symptomatic overlaps in the pathophysiology of COVID‐19 induced ARDS and high altitude illnesses (i.e., hypoxemia, dyspnea…) have been reported but are also common to other pathologies (i.e., heart failure, pulmonary embolism, COPD…). Most treatments of altitude illnesses have limited value and may even be detrimental in COVID‐19. Some may be efficient, potentially the corticosteroid dexamethasone. Physiological adaptations to altitude/hypoxia can exert diverse effects, depending on the constitution of the target individual and the hypoxic dose. In healthy individuals, they may optimize oxygen supply and increase mitochondrial, antioxidant, and immune system function. It is highly debated if these physiological responses to hypoxia overlap in many instances with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and may exert preventive effects under very specific conditions. The temporal overlap of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and exposure to altitude/hypoxia may be detrimental. No evidence‐based knowledge is presently available on whether and how altitude/hypoxia may prevent, treat or aggravate COVID‐19. The reported lower incidence and mortality of COVID‐19 in high‐altitude places remain to be confirmed. High‐altitude illnesses and COVID‐19 pathologies exhibit clear pathophysiological differences. While potentially effective as a prophylactic measure, altitude/hypoxia is likely associated with elevated risks for patients with COVID‐19. Altogether, the different points discussed in this review are of possibly some relevance for individuals who aim to reach high‐altitude areas. However, due to the ever‐changing state of understanding of COVID‐19, all points discussed in this review may be out of date at the time of its publication.","Millet, Grégoire P.; Debevec, Tadej; Brocherie, Franck; Burtscher, Martin; Burtscher, Johannes",Physiol Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33340275/; https://doi.org/10.14814/phy2.14615,597

Whether the characteristic findings of Chest CT could differentiate confirmed COVID-19 cases from other positive nucleic acid test (NAT)-negative patients has not been rigorously evaluated. Purpose We aim to test whether chest computed tomography (CT) manifestation of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) can be differentiated by a radiologist or a computer-based CT image analysis system. Methods We conducted a retrospective case-control study that included 52 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients and 80 non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia patients between 20 December, 2019 and 10 February, 2020. The chest CT images were evaluated by radiologists in a double blind fashion. A computer-based image analysis system (uAI system, Lianying Inc., Shanghai, China) detected the lesions in 18 lung segments defined by Boyden classification system and calculated the infected volume in each segment. The number and volume of lesions detected by radiologist and computer system was compared with Chi-square test or Mann-Whitney U test as appropriate. Results The main CT manifestations of COVID-19 were multi-lobar/segmental peripheral ground-glass opacities and patchy air space infiltrates. The case and control groups were similar in demographics, comorbidity, and clinical manifestations. There was no significant difference in eight radiologist identified CT image features between the two groups of patients. There was also no difference in the absolute and relative volume of infected regions in each lung segment. Conclusions We documented the non-differentiating nature of initial chest CT image between COVID-19 and other viral pneumonia with suspected symptoms. Our results do not support CT findings replacing microbiological diagnosis as a critical criterion for COVID-19 diagnosis. Our findings may prompt re-evaluation of isolated patients without laboratory confirmation.","Dou, Qingli; Liu, Jiangping; Zhang, Wenwu; Gu, Yanan; Hsu, Wan-Ting; Ho, Kuan-Ching; Tong, Hoi Sin; Yu, Wing Yan; Lee, Chien-Chang",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.27.20141531v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.27.20141531,597

METHODS: The SCREEN trial is designed as a stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial. Hospital wards (total of 45 wards, constituting clusters in this design) are randomized to have active alert vs. masked alert, 5 wards at a time, with each 5 wards constituting a sequence. The study consists of ten 2-month periods with a phased introduction of the intervention. In the first period, all wards have a masked alert for 2 months. Afterwards the intervention (alert system) is implemented in a new sequence every 2-month period until the intervention is implemented in all sequences. The intervention includes the implementation of an electronic alert system developed in the hospital electronic medical records based on the quick sequential organ failure assessment (qSOFA). The alert system sends notifications of “possible sepsis alert” to the bedside nurse, charge nurse, and primary medical team and requires an acknowledgment in the health information system from the bedside nurse and physician. The calculated sample size is 65,250. The primary endpoint is in-hospital mortality by 90 days.

650141,COVID-19 COGNITIVE DEFICITS AFTER RESPIRATORY ASSISTANCE IN THE SUBACUTE PHASE:A COVID-REHABILITATION UNIT EXPERIENCE,2020-11-15,"Background. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic is still far from stabilizing. Of particular concern is the sharp increase in the number of diseases in June-July 2020. The causes and consequences of this sharp increase in the number of cases are still waiting for their researchers, but there is already an urgent need to assess the possible duration of the pandemic, the expected number of patients and deaths. The resumption of international passenger traffic needs the information for deciding which countries' citizens are welcome guests. Correct simulation of the infectious disease dynamics needs complicated mathematical models and many efforts for unknown parameters identification. Constant changes in the pandemic conditions (in particular, the peculiarities of quarantine and its violation, situations with testing and isolation of patients) cause various epidemic waves, lead to changes in the parameter values of the mathematical models. Objective. In this article, pandemic waves in Ukraine and in the world will be detected, calculated and discussed. The estimations for hidden periods, epidemic durations and final numbers of cases will be presented. The probabilities of meeting a person spreading the infection and reproduction numbers will be calculated for different countries and regions. Methods. We propose a simple method for the epidemic waves detection based on the differentiation of the smoothed number of cases. We use the known SIR (susceptible-infected-removed) model for the dynamics of the epidemic waves. The known exact solution of the SIR differential equations and statistical approach were modified and used. Results. The optimal values of the SIR model parameters were identified for four waves of pandemic dynamics in Ukraine and five waves in the world. The number of cases and the number of patients spreading the infection versus time were calculated. In particular, the pandemic probably began in August 2019. If current trends continue, the end of the pandemic should be expected no earlier than in March 2021 both in Ukraine and in the world, the global number of cases will exceed 20 million. The probabilities of meeting a person spreading the infection and reproduction numbers were calculated for different countries and regions. Conclusions. The SIR model and statistical approach to the parameter identification are helpful to make some reliable estimations of the epidemic waves. The number of persons spreading the infection versus time was calculated during all the epidemic waves. The obtained information will be useful to regulate the quarantine activities, to predict the medical and economic consequences of the pandemic and to decide which countries' citizens are welcome guests.","Nesteruk, I.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.03.20167098v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.03.20167098,597

650682,COVID-19 guidelines for optometry and optical services post-lockdown,2020-07-24,"BACKGROUND: Korean traditional food (KTF), originated from ancestral agriculture and the nomadic traditions of the Korean peninsula and southern Manchuria, is based on healthy food that balances disease prevention and treatment. Fermented foods that include grains, herbs, fruits, and mushrooms are also an important practice in KTF, providing high levels of Lactobacilli, which confer relevant health benefits, including antiviral properties. Some of these probiotics may also protect against the Influenza virus through the modulation of innate immunity. SCOPE AND APPROACH: The emerging of the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to other diseases of viral origin, and the problems associated with other respiratory disorders, highlight how essential is a healthy eating pattern to strengthen our immune system. Key Findings and Conclusions: The present review covers the information available on edible plants, herbs, mushrooms, and preparations used in KTF to outline their multiple medicinal effects (e.g., antidiabetic, chemopreventive, antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial), emphasizing their role and effects on the immune system with an emphasis on modulating properties of the gut microbiota that further support strong respiratory immunity. Potential functional foods commonly used in Korean cuisine such as Kimchi (a mixture of fermented vegetables), Meju, Doenjang, Jeotgal, and Mekgeolli and fermented sauces, among others, are highlighted for their great potential to improve gut-lung immunity. The traditional Korean diet and dietary mechanisms that may target viruses ACE-2 receptors or affect any step of a virus infection pathway that can determine a patient's prognosis are also highlighted. The regular oral intake of bioactive ingredients used in Korean foods can offer protection for some viral diseases, through protective and immunomodulatory effects, as evidenced in pre-clinical and clinical studies.","Das, Gitishree; Heredia, J.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at the Hospital Clinico San Carlos of Madrid, Spain. A total of 301 subjects from the COVID admission unit with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. The presence and clinical characteristics of conjunctivitis were evaluated. Laboratory, radiological, and clinical results in patients with and without conjunctivitis stratified by sex were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 301 subjects included, 180 patients (59.8%) were male and the median age was 72 years (IQ 59–82). Overall, 35 patients (11.6%) were diagnosed with acute conjunctivitis. We found no relationship between the COVID-19 severity score and the presence of conjunctivitis (P = 0.17). However, conjunctivitis was more frequent in males with moderate clinical severity and in women classified as clinically mild. The natural history of the disease seems to be a rapid self-limited conjunctivitis that improves without treatment and does not affect visual acuity nor associate short-term complications. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately, 1 out of 10 hospitalized non-critical COVID-19 patients presents conjunctivitis during the disease.

651414,The consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on non-COVID-19 clinical trials,2020-05-26,"PURPOSE: Black people give birth joyously despite disproportionate rates of adverse perinatal outcomes. Given that group prenatal care shows promise in mitigating these inequities, we sought to solicit the opinions of Black peripartum women on how group prenatal care could be tailored to fit their specific needs. In this study, we describe attitudes about a proposed Black group prenatal care in a single focus group of 11 Black women who receive maternal health services from Black Infant Health (BIH, a state and federal funded state-wide program for Black pregnant people with the goal to improve infant and maternal health). These data were used to design a race-conscious group prenatal care curriculum specifically for Black women at UCSF. DESCRIPTION: This study was an analysis of focus group data generated as part of a larger project focused on community involvement in Black maternal health. English speaking pregnant or recently postpartum women age 18 or older who receive services from BIH were recruited to participated in the focus group analyzed in this study. All facilitators of the focus group were Black women in order to facilitate candid conversation about racism in prenatal care. ASSESSMENT: The need for mental health care was common thread underlying all conversations about prenatal health improvements desired by our focus groups. Participants expressed the centrality of mental health access during our discussion of other themes (e.g.: ease of access, inclusion of partners, special classes for teen moms) by discussing them in terms of their relationship to mental health. Our participants’ clear expression of the centrality of mental health care to their prenatal health guided our decision to focus on mental health as a necessary pillar of any group prenatal care intervention designed to mitigate perinatal healthcare disparities in this paper. Three themes related to mental health integration into group prenatal care emerged from thematic analysis of the transcripts. Participants expressed insufficient access and advocacy, and provider distrust. CONCLUSION: Evidence exists supporting group prenatal care as a tool for mitigation of perinatal health disparities among Black women. There is also a large body of data describing the disproportionate burden of mental health needs among Black women. The rich data we present here from Black women on their desire for the integration of these two needs fits well into the parallel conversation occurring in the literature. To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating desires of Black women regarding group prenatal care designed specifically for them. They expressed a strong desire for more access to mental health care providers who are racially conscious and aware of white supremacy, and nuanced opinions on the role of racial concordance in health equity.","Kemet, Shakkaura; Yang, Yihui; Nseyo, Onouwem; Bell, Felicha; Gordon, Anastasia Yinpa-ala; Mays, Markita; Fowler, Melinda; Jackson, Andrea",Matern Child Health J,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10995-021-03226-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34519952/,597

The objective was to determine the frequency and distribution of currently known risk factors for COVID‐19 mortality in a MS population. METHODS: MS patients with at least one complete case report between January 1(st), 2015 and December 31(st), 2019 from the Innsbruck MS database (IMSD) were cross‐sectionally included. Frequencies of currently estimated COVID‐19 mortality risk factors were analyzed and the cumulative risk was calculated by a recently developed score. For every risk group, the proportions of patients under DMT and immunosuppressive treatment were determined. RESULTS: Of 1931 MS patients, 63.4% had low risk of COVID‐19 mortality, 26% had mild risk, 8.8% had a moderate risk, while a combined 0.9% had high or very high risk of COVID‐19 mortality. Of the patients at high or very high risk, only one patient received DMT and none had an immunosuppressive therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In a population‐based MS cohort, the proportion of patients at high risk of COVID‐19 mortality is below 1%.

651735,When the Others Become Us: A Chemist’s Perspective of the COVID-19 Outbreak in Italy,2020-05-08,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The role of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors, notably angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), in the COVID-19 pandemic has not been fully evaluated. With an increasing number of COVID-19 cases worldwide, it is imperative to better understand the impact of RAAS inhibitors in hypertensive COVID patients. PubMed, Embase and the pre-print database Medrxiv were searched, and studies with data on patients on ACEi/ARB with COVID-19 were included. Random effects models were used to estimate the pooled mean difference with 95% confidence interval using Open Meta[Analyst] software. RECENT FINDINGS: A total of 28,872 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The use of any RAAS inhibition for any conditions showed a trend to lower risk of death/critical events (OR 0.671, CI 0.435 to 1.034, p = 0.071). Within the hypertensive cohort, however, there was a significant lower association with deaths (OR 0.664, CI 0.458 to 0.964, p = 0.031) or the combination of death/critical outcomes (OR 0.670, CI 0.495 to 0.908, p = 0.010). There was no significant association of critical/death outcomes within ACEi vs non-ACEi (OR 1.008, CI 0.822 to 1.235, p = 0.941) and ARB vs non-ARB (OR 0.946, CI 0.735 to 1.218, p = 0.668). SUMMARY: This is the largest meta-analysis including critical events and mortality data on patients prescribed ACEi/ARB and found evidence of beneficial effects of chronic ACEi/ARB use especially in hypertensive cohort with COVID-19. As such, we would strongly encourage patients to continue with RAAS inhibitor pharmacotherapy during the COVID-19 pandemic.

651977,Impact of COVID-19 on Dermatology Residency,2021-07-29,"In recent decades, France has appeared as a country particularly hostile to vaccination in general. When asked in November 2020 about the intention to take the Covid-19 vaccine, the French public showed, once again, reluctance. Therefore, France appeared as an ideal case study to analyze whether the hostility toward the Covid-19 vaccine has its own reasons or whether it is related to the reluctance to the principle of vaccination itself. Our objective was to determine the specificity of the social determinants of the intention to get the Covid-19 vaccine. Thanks to the use of a large random sample of the general population in France (86,000 individuals), the reluctant to Covid-19 vaccine could be clearly distinguished from the hesitant and the convinced, and thereby thoroughly analyzed. Our analysis highlighted a gendered reluctance toward vaccination in general but even more so regarding vaccination against Covid-19. It might refer to women being more concerned about the possible effects of an injection in their body, especially at the age of maternity and a differentiated socialization making them more sensitive than men to long-term risks and more apprehensive toward rapid technological change. We also found that people at the bottom of the social hierarchy, in terms of level of education, financial resources, and immigration status, were more likely to refuse the Covid-19 vaccine. Nevertheless, this reluctance was less prominent than for vaccination in general, reflecting the actual spread of the epidemic in various social milieux. Finally, our analysis showed that trust in the government's actions was significantly associated with reluctance toward the Covid-19 vaccine, even more than toward vaccination in general. Specific campaigns should be thought beforehand to reach women and people at the bottom of the social hierarchy to avoid furthering social inequalities in terms of morbidity and mortality.","Spire, A.; Silberzan, L.; Bajos, N.; group, The EpiCov study",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.07.21258461; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.07.21258461v1?rss=1,597

A further step in this field is offered by MSC-derived extracellular vesicles (EV), which are naturally released nanosized lipid bilayer-delimited particles with a key role in cell-to-cell communication. Herein, in this review, we further describe and discuss the rationale, outcomes and challenges of our evidence-based therapy approaches using Wharton’s jelly MSC and derived EV in post-MI management.","Muñoz-Domínguez, Noelia; Roura, Santiago; Prat-Vidal, Cristina; Vives, Joaquim",Pharmaceutics,https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics13091336; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34575412/,597
652236,Exploring lectin-glycan interactions to combat COVID-19: lessons acquired from other enveloped viruses,2020-10-21,"The pandemic caused by Sars-CoV-2 (COVID-19) has been a great concern for public and mental health systems worldwide. The identification of risk groups is essential for the establishment of preventive and therapeutic strategies, as for substance users. During COVID-19 pandemic, there was an increase in the use of psychoactive substances during the lockdown, including cannabis. This commentary reviews relevant findings and discusses scientific evidence on the risks of worse clinical and psychiatric complications due to coronavirus disease COVID-19 in subjects who use cannabis. Although they are not included as a risk group in the health recommendations for that disease, they may have a more vulnerable respiratory system to viral diseases. There are certain similarities between the harmful cardiovascular and respiratory effects of cannabis use and those of smoking. Due to the different modes of smoking, cannabis chemicals are retained in the body for longe and may also contain other toxic substances such as tar, a substance found in tobacco and which has been associated with the development of lung cancer, bronchitis and pulmonary emphysema. Therefore, we discuss if individuals who use cannabis regularly might be more vulnerable to COVID-19 infection. This population deserves more clinical attention worldwide and this manuscript can help clinicians become more aware of cannabis risks during pandemics and develop specific intervention strategies.","Borgonhi, Ellen Mello; Volpatto, Vanessa Loss; Ornell, Felipe; Rabelo-da-Ponte, Francisco Diego; Kessler, Felix Henrique Paim",Addict Sci Clin Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33472704/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13722-021-00214-0,597

This study aims to illustrate the current status and key areas of the application of new IT in the prevention and control of COVID-19. METHODS: Literature related to the prevention and control of COVID-19 with new IT since 2020 was retrieved from China National Knowledge Internet and Wanfang Literature databases, the two most authoritative databases in China. CiteSpace 5.7.R2 was used to analyze the institutions, authors, and keywords of the articles. The application of new IT is determined by keywords and highly cited documents. RESULTS: A total of 1,711 articles were included, as the number of publications has been continually increasing over the investigation period. The six hot topics of new IT applied in COVID-19 were big data, artificial intelligence, Internet+, blockchain, Internet of Things, and 5G. The most productive institution is University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the most productive author in this field is Tao Pei, whose article, “Multi-level Spatial Distribution Estimation Model of the Inter-Regional Migrant Population Using Multi-Source Spatio-Temporal Big Data: A Case Study of Migrants from Wuhan During the Spread of COVID-19,” was highly cited.

Policy mandates and fears of becoming infected or infecting others have impelled populations to shelter at home, socially distance, and otherwise reduce direct, in-person interactions with others. By enabling people to conduct many regular activities remotely, including working, learning, shopping, and receiving medical services, technology has allowed the continuation of some semblance of a normal lifestyle in this new environment. Within this context, the IT sector has provided the tools and resources required to support these remote activities, as well as to address the pandemic more directly through efforts such as supporting contact tracing and providing high-performance computing resources for COVID-19-related research. This paper discusses in more detail this impact of the pandemic on the technology industry, and its response to this shock, by addressing three elements: accelerated digital transformation, increased importance of technology in the economy and society, and prevalence of inequalities in access to and the use of technology.","Evans, Carolyn",Bus Econ,https://doi.org/10.1057/s11369-020-00191-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33250520/,597

However, the underlying mechanism connecting risk perception and health-protective behaviors is not well understood. The current study investigates how risk perception predicts hospital pharmacists’ engagement in health-protective behaviors during the peak period of COVID-19 pandemic in China and the mediating effects of lay theories of health and self-efficacy. METHOD: A cross-sectional study on risk perception and engagement in health-protective behaviors was conducted among hospital pharmacists during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. A total of 4121 hospital pharmacists completed the study. RESULTS: Risk perception, self-efficacy, and lay theories of health were significant predictors of health-protective behaviors among pharmacists. Lay (entity) theories of health and self-efficacy mediated the relationship between risk perception and engagement in health-protective behaviors among hospital pharmacists. CONCLUSION: Risk perception, self-efficacy, and lay theories (entity versus incremental) of health significantly predicted hospital pharmacists’ engagement in health-protective behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic in China.

653538,The Impact of COVID-19 on Diabetic Retinopathy Monitoring and Treatment,2021-09-08,"Discovery of new viruses has been boosted by novel deep sequencing technologies. Currently, many viruses can be identified by sequencing without knowledge of the pathogenicity of the virus. However, attributing the presence of a virus in patient material to a disease in the patient can be a challenge. One approach to meet this challenge is identification of viral sequences based on enrichment by autologous patient antibody capture. This method facilitates identification of viruses that have provoked an immune response within the patient and may increase the sensitivity of the current virus discovery techniques. To demonstrate the utility of this method, virus discovery deep sequencing (VIDISCA-454) was performed on clinical samples from 19 patients: 13 with a known respiratory viral infection and 6 with a known gastrointestinal viral infection. Patient sera was collected from one to several months after the acute infection phase. Input and antibody capture material was sequenced and enrichment was assessed. In 18 of the 19 patients, viral reads from immunogenic viruses were enriched by antibody capture (ranging between 1.5x to 343x in respiratory material, and 1.4x to 53x in stool). Enriched reads were also determined in an identity independent manner by using a novel algorithm Xcompare. In 16 of the 19 patients, 21% to 100% of the enriched reads were derived from infecting viruses. In conclusion, the technique provides a novel approach to specifically identify immunogenic viral sequences among the bulk of sequences which are usually encountered during virus discovery metagenomics.","Oude Munnink, Bas B.; Jazaeri Farsani, Seyed Mohammad; Deijs, Martin; Jonkers, Jiri; Verhoeven, Joost T.

653559,Inimical effects of COVID-19 on surgical residency: Correspondence,2020-06-06,"Rip currents are one of the coastal hazards that put Malaysian beachgoers in a risky position. Most of the drowning accidents that occur at beaches worldwide are closely associated with this phenomenon. Research on rip currents is needed to build an effective measuring tool to overcome these issues. However, to date, research on rip currents is mainly focused on its physical aspects, commonly concentrating on the processes that influence and relate to the rips’ generation. As an effort to minimize the negative consequences exerted by the rips, there is an urgent need to enhance the rip-related research in the social sciences field. Comprehensive research that includes all fields might produce more beneficial and reliable information. Therefore, this study intends to examine the level of public understanding of rip currents and beach safety knowledge of the Teluk Cempedak Beach. A questionnaire comprising 5 sections and 31 questions was developed as the primary tool in this study. A total of 60 beachgoers have been surveyed for this preliminary study through a questionnaire to investigate their demographic profile, frequency of visiting the beach, swimming ability, and their knowledge of rip currents and beach safety. The results show that the beachgoers have poor knowledge of rip currents. Conversely, they are observed to have higher beach safety knowledge. Also, the findings help in filling the research gaps of this study in terms of the instrument used for the data collection procedure. Above all, an extension of this study may contribute to the development of beneficial tools in assessing public knowledge on beach safety and rip currents throughout Malaysian beaches.

The new coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), shows a high organ specificity for the lower respiratory tract. Since there is so far no effective treatment or vaccination against the virus, early diagnostic recognition is of great importance. Due to the specific aspects of the infection, which mainly begins in the peripheral lung parenchyma, lung ultrasonography is suitable as a diagnostic imaging method to identify suspected cases as such in the early stages of the disease. Serial ultrasound examinations on patients with confirmed COVID-19 can promptly detect changes in the affected lung tissue at the bedside.

This study sought to investigate the proportion of women in senior hospital leadership positions and to investigate whether hospital and community factors are associated with the likelihood of having women in executive positions. Methods: The main data of 4397 hospitals were sourced from the American Hospital Association. The study calculated the proportion of women for each position, with county-level adjusted standard errors and logistic transformed confidence intervals to determine the variation of women in chief officer positions across hospitals. The study also used multilevel mixed-effects logistic regressions to estimate the probability of having a female chief officer. Results: Women executives generally were underrepresented in all positions except in chief human resources and chief nursing officer positions, 73% (95% confidence interval [CI] 7175) and 91% (95% CI 8694), respectively. Women accounted for 13% (95% CI 821) of system chief executive officers (CEOs) and only 27% (95% CI 2628) of hospital CEOs. System size (number of hospitals) and hospital size (beds capacity) variables were statistically significant in five of the eight positions investigated. Overall, women were less likely to hold chief positions in large hospitals (400 beds and over) compared to small hospitals (under 100 beds). Conclusion: Women were underrepresented in hospital top positions and were less likely to hold executive positions in large systems or hospitals. The results suggest structural barriers that hinder women from advancing to top hospital positions.","Mose, Jason N.",Womens Health Rep (New Rochelle),https://doi.org/10.1089/whr.2020.0111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34036295/,597

Matériels et méthodes Entre le 16 avril 2020 et le 29 avril 2020, dans 4 EHPAD participant à cette phase pilote à Paris tout personnel non connu pour avoir le COVID quelle que soit sa fonction, s’est fait prélever sur un même site, dans un délai maximal de 72h. L’ARN du virus était recherché par RT-PCR sur écouvillon rhino pharyngé. Résultats Avant la campagne, toutes les EHPAD avaient eu des cas confirmés de COVID avec un taux de sujets atteints de 21,75 % (67/308) parmi les résidents, 15,2 % (40/263) parmi le personnel. Parmi les 236 membres du personnel, non connus pour avoir le COVID et dépistés, le SARS-COV-2 a été retrouvé par RT-PCR chez 33 des personnels testés (14,7 %). Les personnels porteurs de SARS-COV-2 étaient strictement asymptomatiques dans 73 % cas.

654491,The Indian perspective of COVID-19 outbreak,2020-05-04,"With the development of Internet technology, the speed of information dissemination and accelerated updates result in frequent discussion of topics and expressions of public opinion. In general, multi-dimensional discussion topics related to the same event are often generated in the network, and the phenomenon of multi-dimensional public opinion polarization is formed under the mutual influence of groups. This paper targets the phenomenon of multi-dimensional public opinion polarization under topic-derived situations as the research object. Firstly, this paper identifies the factors influencing multi-dimensional public opinion polarization, including the mutual influence of different topic dimensions and the interaction of viewpoints within the same topic. Secondly, the topic correlation coefficient is introduced to describe the correlation among topics in different dimensions, and the individual topic support degree is used to measure the influence of topics in different dimensions and that of information from external intervention on individual attitudes. Thirdly, a multi-dimensional public opinion polarization model is constructed by further integrating multi-dimensional attitude interaction rules. Finally, the influence of individual participation, topic status, topic correlation coefficient and external intervention information on the multi-dimensional public opinion polarization process is analyzed through simulation experiments. The simulation results show that: (1) when there is a negative correlation between multi-dimensional topics, as the number of participants on different dimensional topics becomes more consistent, the conflict between multi-dimensional topics will weaken the polarization effect of overall public opinion. However, the effect of public opinion polarization will be enhanced alongwith the enhancement in the confidence of individual opinions. (2) The intervention of external intervention information in different dimensions at different times will further form a multi-dimensional and multi-stage public opinion polarization, and when the multi-dimensional topics are negatively correlated, the intervention of external intervention information will have a stronger impact on the multi-dimensional and multi-stage public opinion polarization process. Finally, the rationality and validity of the proposed model are verified by a real case.","Chen, Tinggui; Wang, Yulong; Yang, Jianjun; Cong, Guodong",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33430091/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18020472,597

Since university students were considered uniquely vulnerable to mental health problems even before the pandemic, this study aimed to investigate lifestyle and behavioral changes experienced by this population due to the epidemiological situation and their effect on their mental health. Data were collected via an online survey conducted among university students across Poland. The survey addressed recent lifestyle changes that were a result of the pandemic as well as psychological distress, symptoms of insomnia and symptoms of post-traumatic stress. The results indicate that protective factors include maintaining a daily routine, staying physically active, following a usual eating pattern and taking care of sleep hygiene. Changes in behavior contributing to poorer mental health included giving up a daily routine, neglecting meals, tidiness, hygiene as well as social relationships, changes in food intake, sleeping schedule, a decrease in physical activity and the onset of sexual dysfunctions. A history of psychiatric treatment and an increase in self-harm as well as an increase in alcohol and tobacco consumption were also found to be associated with psychological distress. Experienced lifestyle and behavioral changes and their impact on mental health were apparent throughout the obtained data, highlighting the need for psychological support in the studied population.

A total of 63 college students participated in the experiment. In the experimental group (N = 31), a wise intervention based on reading and writing was adopted to intervene in perceived discrimination among the participants. The results showed that the perceived discrimination among students returning from Wuhan to towns outside of Hubei Province was significantly higher than that among students returning to towns within Hubei Province. The wise intervention reduced the perceived discrimination in the experimental group but not in the control group. Further analysis found that perceived social support fully mediated the relationship between the intervention and perceived discrimination.

Using a discrete-time likelihood model, the authors estimated the transmission probability per contact for each day following the onset of symptoms. The results suggested that there may be two peaks in the probability of SARS transmission, the first occurring around day 2 after symptom onset and the second occurring approximately 10 days after symptom onset. Index patients who were aged 60 years or older or whose lactate dehydrogenase level was elevated upon admission to the hospital (indicating higher viral loads) were more likely to transmit SARS to their contacts. There was little variation in the daily transmission probabilities before versus after the introduction of public health interventions on or around March 26, 2003. This study suggests that the probability of transmission of SARS is dependent upon characteristics of the index patients and does not simply reflect temporal variability in the viral load of SARS cases.","Pitzer, Virginia E.; Leung, Gabriel M.; Lipsitch, Marc",Am J Epidemiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17493952/,597

Brought into the spotlight through the AIDS drugs access crisis, challenges in accessing lifesaving medicines and vaccines—because they are either not available or inaccessible due to excessive pricing—are being faced by people all over the world. To appreciate the underlying framing of current access discussions, it is important to understand past trends in global health policies and the thinking behind the institutions and mechanisms that were designed to solve access problems. Contrary to what might be expected, certain types of solutions intrinsically carry the conditions that enable scarcity, rationing, and inequity, and lead us away from ensuring the right to health. Analyzing the root causes of access problems and the political economy that allows them to persist and even become exacerbated is necessary to fix access inequities today and to design better solutions to ensure equitable access to health technologies in the future.","Krikorian, Gaëlle; Torreele, Els",Health Hum Rights,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34194206/,597

We conducted a retrospective single-center study of 98 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at Yeungnam University Medical Center in Daegu, South Korea. Sixty patients were women (61.2%), and the mean age was 55.4±17.1 years. Thirteen patients (13.3%) were treated in the intensive care unit (ICU). The mean interval from symptom onset to hospitalization was 7.7±4.5 days. Patients who received ICU care were significantly older and were more likely to have diabetes mellitus. The National Early Warning Score on the day of admission was significantly higher in patients requiring ICU care. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (13/13 patients; 100%), septic shock (9/13; 69.2%), acute cardiac injury (9/13; 69.2%), and acute kidney injury (8/13; 61.5%) were more common in patients who received ICU care. All patients received antibiotic therapy, and most (97/98 patients; 99.0%) received antiviral therapy (lopinavir/ritonavir). Hydroxychloroquine was used in 79 patients (80.6%), and glucocorticoid therapy was used in 18 patients (18.4%). In complete blood counts, lymphopenia was the most common finding (40/98 patients; 40.8%). Levels of all proinflammatory cytokines were significantly higher in ICU patients. As of March 29, 2020, the mortality rate was 5.1%.

Comparison of methodological and reporting quality of covid-19 and other research from the first wave of the pandemic,2021-08-22,"BACKGROUND: Human-to-animal transmission of M. tuberculosis (Mtb) is reported in South Africa but there is a paucity of epidemiological data. The aim of this One Health manuscript is to describe zooanthroponotic exposure of domestic animals to TB patients, virtually all of whom had laboratory confirmed pulmonary Mtb disease. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was nested within two TB contact tracing studies and collected data from 2017 to 2019. TB index patients and their households in three provinces of South Africa were recruited. A questionnaire was administered to households, assessing type and number of animals owned, degree of exposure of animals to humans, and veterinary consultations. For this analysis, we compared descriptive variables by animal-keeping status (animal-keeping vs non-animal keeping households), calculated the chi square and respective p-values. RESULTS: We visited 1766 households with at least one confirmed case of TB, 33% (587/1766) had livestock or companion animals. Of non-animal-owning households, 2% (27/1161) cared for other community members' livestock. Few (16%, 92/587) households kept animals in their dwelling overnight, while 45% (266/587) kept animals outside the home, but within 10 m of where people slept and ate. Most (81%, 478/587) of people in animal-owning households were willing for their animal/s to have a TB skin test, but <1% (5/587) of animals had been skin-tested; 4% (24/587) of animal-owning households had a veterinary consultation in the past six months, and 5% (31/587) reported one of their animals dying from natural causes in the prior six months. CONCLUSION: Our survey suggests that a high proportion of patients with TB live in settings facilitating close contact with domestic animal species with known susceptibility to Mtb. There is a substantial exposure of household animals to patients with TB and therefore risk of both transmission to, and spillback from animals to humans.","Moyo, Maureen; Lebina, Limakatso; Milovanovic, Minja; MacPherson, Peter; Michel, Anita; Martinson, Neil",One Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34504938/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.onehlt.2021.100319,597

The unprecedented plights that have arisen have led nations to devise ethical roadmaps for handling their finite resources. Muslim countries are no exception and must continue to endure the effects of the pandemic, as more waves of infections from new strains are being reported. Given the scarcity of resources available to some countries, it is critical to adopt a roadmap to prioritize these limited resources based on ethical guidelines that are acceptable to Muslim communities. This work describes the concept of “ijtihad”, a process frequently used by Muslim scholars to develop novel solutions to deal with unprecedented events, such as the recent pandemic. In this manuscript, Islamic perspectives were discussed on social justice and equality and how limited resources can be used in a way consistent with such perspectives. Relying on previous experiences of the Muslim community, such as the plague of Amwas, in which social distancing and quarantine strategies were used effectively to control the disease, and utilizing available guidelines such as “Al-Qawaid Al-Fiqhiyyah” and “Fiqh Al-Nawazel”, we propose a practical protocol and roadmap that can be applied in the current crisis. Managing and prioritizing limited medical resources requires a just and ethically acceptable system. Islamic leaders should immediately develop a roadmap that emphasizes ethical values such as ihsan and altruism to help Muslim countries prioritize the limited medical resources available to medical staff to guarantee the sustainability of health services.","Al-Balas, Qosay A.

Health care workers (HCWs) face enormous pressure due to work overload, negative emotions, exhaustion, lack of contact with their families, and risk of catching the infection and death. AIM: This study aims to assess the level of stress perceived by HCWs and possible associated factors during the COVID-19 outbreak in Palestine. METHODS: A cross-sectional sample of 430 frontlines HCWs was conducted using an online self-reported questionnaire. HCWs’ stress from the COVID-19 outbreak, factors that increase stress, and the activities that reduced stress were assessed. Chi-square test was used to compare between a categorical variable and the study outcome; associations are presented as odds ratios (OR) and confidence intervals (95% CI) with 0.05 significance level. Al-Najah National University institutional review board granted ethics approval. RESULTS: Most respondents (74.0%) reported high-stress levels during the outbreak. Fear of transmitting the virus to family was the most stressful factor (91.6%). HCWs who did not have training on the outbreak response were more likely to have high-stress levels (OR = 2.7 [95% CI = 1.7-4.4], P < .001). Those with high stress reported being disappointed (OR = 2.4 [95% CI = 1.5-3.6], P < .001), and strongly considered taking sick leave (OR = 3.9 [95% CI = 1.9-7.9], P < .001). CONCLUSION: HCWs are under tremendous stress, given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding the psychological impact of the outbreak on HCWs and the activities that mitigate the stress is crucial to guide policies and interventions that can maintain psychological well-being.","Maraqa, Beesan; Nazzal, Zaher; Zink, Therese",J Prim Care Community Health,https://doi.org/10.1177/2150132720955026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32847464/,597

The financial collapse quickly overflowed into the real economy and caused, among other effects, a sharp fall in the flow of world trade. Using export data from Brazilian municipalities, we show that the subprime crisis had a more significant effect on production and employment in exporting cities than municipalities more devoted to the domestic economy. We find that the manufacturing and construction sectors of exporting cities were the most affected during the crisis. However, exporting municipalities with a substantial share of services activities were more resilient to the external crisis. This difference is significant and sheds light on the debate on the effects of the crisis on Brazilian regions and cities. Using a unique business management dataset that contains firm-to-firm controls, we also find spillovers in the labor market from exporting to domestic-oriented cities through job reallocation. Our results suggest that workers migrate from exporting municipalities to other non-exporting municipalities within the same firm economic group.","Silva, Thiago Christiano; Muniz, Fabiano José; Tabak, Benjamin Miranda",Empir Econ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33897095/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00181-021-02051-1,597

As a special population, the pregnant and delivery women maybe influenced both in physical and psychological aspects. The meta-analysis was conducted about mental health in pregnant and delivery women. METHODS: We searched both MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library in English and CBM, CNKI, WANFANG and CSSCI in Chinese to find literature from December 2019 to 31 July 2020 related to COVID-19 and mental health in patient with pregnancy and delivery, among which results such as comments, letters, reviews and case reports were excluded. The prevalence of anxiety and depression in the population was synthesized and discussed. RESULTS: A total of 11,187 subjects were included in 15 studies. Random effect model is used to account for the data by Revman 5.2. The results showed that the prevalence of depression was 30% (95% CI: 0.23-0.37), the prevalence of anxiety was 34% (95% CI: 0.26-0.43) and prevalence of both anxiety and depression was 18% (95% CI: 0.09-0.29). The prevalence of anxiety (OR = 2.15, 95% CI: 1.39-3.31, Z = 3.47, p=.0005), depression (OR = 1.95, 95% CI: 1.07-3.56, Z = 2.19, p=.03) were higher than that of controls. Significant heterogeneity was detected across studies regarding these prevalence estimates. Subgroup analysis was taken according to assessment tools, and sensitivity analysis was done to explore the sources of heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: The higher prevalence of depression, anxiety, both depression and anxiety in women with pregnancy and delivery during COVID-19 pandemic although the significant heterogeneity detected in studies.

Studies that evaluate the outcome of this rapid teletherapy adoption and implementation are pertinent. OBJECTIVE: This single-arm, nonrandomized pilot study aimed to assess the feasibility and initial patient-level outcomes of a psychiatric transitional day program that switched from an in-person group to a video teletherapy group during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Patients with transdiagnostic conditions who were at risk of psychiatric hospitalization were referred to the Adult Transitions Program (ATP) at a large academic medical center in the United States. ATP was a 3-week intensive outpatient program that implemented group teletherapy guided by cognitive and behavioral principles delivered daily for 3 hours per day. Feasibility was assessed via retention, attendance rate, and rate of securing aftercare appointments prior to ATP discharge. Patients completed standardized patient-reported outcome measures at admission and discharge to assess the effectiveness of the program for improving quality of mental health, depression, anxiety, and suicide risk. RESULTS: Patients (N=76) started the program between March and August of 2020. Feasibility was established, with 70 of the 76 patients (92%) completing the program and a mean attendance of 14.43 days (SD 1.22); also, 71 patients (95%) scheduled at least one behavioral health aftercare service prior to ATP discharge. All patient-level reported outcomes demonstrated significant improvements in depression (95% CI –3.6 to –6.2; Cohen d=0.77; P<.001), anxiety (95% CI –3.0 to –4.9; Cohen d=0.74; P<.001), overall suicide risk (95% CI –0.5 to –0.1; Cohen d=0.41; P=.02), wish to live (95% CI 0.3 to 1.0; Cohen d=0.39; P<.001), wish to die (95% CI –0.2 to –1.4; Cohen d=0.52; P=.01), and overall mental health (95% CI 1.5 to 4.5; Cohen d=0.39; P<.001) from admission to discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid adoption and implementation of a group-based teletherapy day program for adults at risk of psychiatric hospitalization appeared to be feasible and effective. Patients demonstrated high completion and attendance rates and reported significant improvements in psychosocial outcomes.

In total, 850 hospitalized patients aged between 3 days and 80 years were screened from September 2010 to April 2014. Among the 351 (47.8%) patients diagnosed with viral infections, viral mixed detection was identified in 49 patients (14%), with human rhinovirus (HRV) being the most common virus associated with viral mixed detection (7.1%), followed by adenovirus (AdV) (4%) and human coronavirus-OC43 (HCoV-OC43) (3.7%). The highest combination of viral mixed detection was identified with HRV and AdV (2%), followed by HRV and HCoV-OC43 (1.4%). Pneumonia and bronchiolitis were the most frequent reason for hospitalization with viral mixed detection (9.1%). There were statistical significance differences between mixed and single detection in patients diagnosed with bronchiolitis (P = 0.002) and pneumonia (P = 0.019).

Based on our analysis of hepatitis C virus and coronavirus replication, and the molecular structures and activities of viral inhibitors, we previously demonstrated that three nucleotide analogues inhibit the SARS-CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Here, using polymerase extension experiments, we have demonstrated that the active triphosphate form of Sofosbuvir (a key component of the FDA approved hepatitis C drug EPCLUSA), is incorporated by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, and blocks further incorporation. Using the same molecular insight, we selected the active triphosphate forms of three other anti-viral agents, Alovudine, AZT (an FDA approved HIV/AIDS drug) and Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF, an FDA approved drug for HIV and hepatitis B) for evaluation as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. We demonstrated the ability of these three viral polymerase inhibitors, 3’-fluoro-3’-deoxythymidine triphosphate, 3’-azido-3’-deoxythymidine triphosphate and Tenofovir diphosphate (the active triphosphate forms of Alovudine, AZT and TAF, respectively) to be incorporated by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, where they also terminate further polymerase extension. These results offer a strong molecular basis for these nucleotide analogues to be evaluated as potential therapeutics for COVID-19.","Chien, Minchen; Anderson, Thomas K.; Jockusch, Steffen; Tao, Chuanjuan; Kumar, Shiv; Li, Xiaoxu; Russo, James J.; Kirchdoerfer, Robert N.; Ju, Jingyue",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.18.997585; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32511320/,597

In medicinal chemistry, the choice of relevant “drug-likeness” scaffold is a starting point for the design of the structure dedicated to specific molecular targets. For many years, the chemical uniqueness of the stilbene structure has inspired scientists from different fields such as chemistry, biology, pharmacy, and medicine. In this review, we present the outstanding potential of the stilbene-based derivatives. Naturally occurring stilbenes, together with powerful synthetic chemistry possibilities, may offer an excellent approach for discovering new structures and identifying their therapeutic targets. With the development of scientific tools, sophisticated equipment, and a better understanding of the disease pathogenesis at the molecular level, the stilbene scaffold has moved innovation in science. This paper mainly focuses on the stilbene-based compounds beyond resveratrol, which are particularly attractive due to their biological activity.

The recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in humans, with evidence that these viruses may have their ancestry in bats, highlights the importance of virus surveillance in bat populations. Here, we report the identification and molecular characterization of a bat β-Coronavirus, detected during a viral survey carried out on different bat species in the island of Sardinia (Italy). Cutaneous, oral swabs, and faecal samples were collected from 46 bats, belonging to 15 different species, and tested for viral presence. Coronavirus RNA was detected in faecal samples from three different species: the greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), the brown long-eared bat (Plecotus auritus), and the European free-tailed bat (Tadarida teniotis). Phylogenetic analyses based on RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) sequences assigned the detected CoV to clade 2b within betacoronaviruses, clustering with SARS-like bat CoVs previously reported. These findings point to the need for continued surveillance of bat CoV circulating in Sardinian bats, and extend the current knowledge on CoV ecology with novel sequences detected in bat species not previously described as β-Coronavirus hosts.","Lecis, Roberta; Mucedda, Mauro; Pidinchedda, Ermanno; Pittau, Marco; Alberti, Alberto",Virus Genes,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11262-018-1614-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30426315/,597

It is the most popular format of point-of-care test (POCT) and quickest and easiest way to detect a targeted molecule. In the combat against COVID-19 pandemic, hundreds of POCTs have been developed and are commercially available now. They are designed to detect either a SARS-CoV-2 viral antigen or IgG and IgM antibodies binding to it. Among the binding antibodies, a special type of functional antibodies that block the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 virus and its human receptor, neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), are of particular interest to public as well as in vaccination management. However as of today, POCTs for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 NAbs remain under late stage of development. Scope and method:In this review, we first summarize the importance of awareness and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 NAbs in the combat against COVID-19 pandemic.

In this review, we have initially performed a meta-analysis of keywords associated with the S protein to frame the outline of important research findings and directions related to it. Based on this outline, we have reviewed the structure, uniqueness, and origin of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the interactions of the Spike protein with host and its implications in COVID-19 pathogenesis, as well as drug and vaccine development, are discussed. We have also summarized the recent advances in detection methods using S protein-based RT-PCR, ELISA, point‐of‐care lateral flow immunoassay, and graphene-based field-effect transistor (FET) biosensors. Finally, we have also discussed the emerging Spike mutants and the efficacy of the Spike-based vaccines against those strains.

Unfortunately, it is difficult to determine the exact prevalence of disease in some African countries due to a large number of asymptomatic cases. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of malaria infections in seemingly healthy children living in the Central African Republic (CAR). CareStart(TM) Malaria HRP2 rapid diagnostic test (RDT) targeting Plasmodium falciparum was used to test a group of 500 asymptomatic children aged 1-15 years old (330 settled Bantu and 170 semi-nomadic BaAka Pygmies) inhabiting the villages in the Dzanga Sangha region (south-west CAR) in March 2020. In total, 32.4% of asymptomatic Bantu and 40.6% of asymptomatic Pygmy children had a positive result of malaria RDT. Our findings allowed us to demonstrate the high prevalence of asymptomatic malaria infections in south-west CAR. RDTs seem to be a useful tool for the detection of Plasmodium falciparum in areas with limited possibilities of using other diagnostic methods, such as light microscopy and molecular biology.","Korzeniewski, Krzysztof; Bylicka-Szczepanowska, Emilia; Lass, Anna",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18020814; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33477889/,597

These enzymes are essential in RNA metabolism, where they are involved in a number of processes that require manipulation of RNA structure. Recent studies have found that some DEAD/DEAH-box helicases play important roles in innate immunity, where they act as sensors of cytosolic DNA/RNA, as adaptor proteins, or as regulators of signaling and gene expression. In spite of their function in immunity, DEAD/DEAH-box helicases can also be hijacked and exploited by viruses to circumvent detection and aid in viral replication. These findings not only imply that DEAD/DEAH-box helicases have a broader function than previously thought, but also give us a much better understanding of immune mechanisms and diseases that arise due to the dysregulation or evasion thereof. In this chapter, we demonstrate the known scope of activities of human DEAD/DEAH-box helicases in innate immunity and interaction with viruses or other pathogens.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IFNG (rs2430561/rs1861493), STAT1 (rs1914408), and VDR (rs2228570) genes were determined in 85 patients from the 2007 Dutch acute Q fever outbreak, and a symptom score was calculated. IFNG rs1861493 showed a significant association with the symptom score; IFNG rs2430561 showed a similar trend. These SNPs were then used to reproduce results in a 2009 outbreak population (n = 123). The median symptom score differed significantly in both populations: 2 versus 7. The significant association of IFNG rs1861493 with symptom score in the first population was not reproduced in the second population. We hypothesize that individuals in the second outbreak were exposed to a higher Coxiella burnetii dose compared to the first, which overruled the protection conferred by the A-allele of IFNG rs1861493 in the first population.","Wielders, C.

Owing to the effects of the COVID pandemic on healthcare, practice of NOT has generally increased by necessity and may, in a post-COVID world, change surgeons perceptions of NOT. Objective: The objective was to determine if the practice of NOT has increased in usage in South Asia and whether these levels of practice would be sustained after the pandemic subside. Methods: A survey was addressed to pediatric surgeons regarding their position, institute, country, number of appendicitis cases managed and their mode of treatment between identical time periods in 2019 and 2020 (April 1 to August 31). It also directly posed the question as to whether they would continue with the COVID imposed level of NOT after the effect of the pandemic diminishes. Results: A total of 134 responses were collected. A significant increase in the practice of NOT was observed for the entire cohort, though no effect was observed when grouped by country or institute. When grouped by position, seniors increased the practice of NOT the most, while juniors reported the least change. The data suggests that only Professors would be inclined to maintaining the COVID level of NOT practice after the pandemic. Conclusions: Increased practice of NOT during the COVID pandemic was observed in South Asia, particularly by senior surgeons. Only Professors appear inclined to consider maintaining this increased level of practice in the post-COVID world.","Hannan, M. J.; Parveen, M. K.; Hoque, M. M.; Chowdhury, T. K.; Hasan, M.

However, the clinical utility of liver biochemistry as a prognostic marker of outcome for COVID-19 is currently debated. Methods: We extracted routinely collected clinical data from a large teaching hospital in the UK, matching 585 hospitalised SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive patients to 1165 hospitalised SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-negative patients for age, gender, ethnicity and pre-existing comorbidities. Liver biochemistry was compared between groups over time to determine whether derangement was associated with outcome. Results: 26.8% (157/585) of COVID-19 patients died, compared to 11.9% (139/1165) in the non-COVID-19 group (p<0.001). At presentation, a significantly higher proportion of the COVID-19 group had elevated alanine aminotransferase (20.7% vs. 14.6%, p=0.004) and hypoalbuminaemia (58.7% vs. 35.0%, p<0.001), compared to the non-COVID-19 group. Within the COVID-19 group, those with hypoalbuminaemia at presentation had 1.83-fold increased hazards of death compared to those with normal albumin (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.83, 95% CI 1.25-2.67), whilst the hazard of death was ~4-fold higher in those aged [â¥]75 years (adjusted HR 3.96, 95% CI 2.59-6.04) and ~3-fold higher in those with pre-existing liver disease (adjusted HR 3.37, 95% CI 1.58-7.16). In the COVID-19 group, alkaline phosphatase increased (R=0.192, p<0.0001) and albumin declined (R=-0.123, p=0.0004) over time in patients who died. We did not find a significant association between other liver biochemistry and death. Conclusion: In this UK population, liver biochemistry is commonly deranged in patients with COVID-19 but only baseline low albumin and a rising alkaline phosphatase over time are prognostic markers for death.","Wang, Tingyan; Smith, David A; Campbell, Cori; Harris, Steve; Salih, Hizni; Varnai, Kinga A; Woods, Kerrie; Noble, Theresa; Freeman, Oliver; Moysova, Zuzana; Marjot, Thomas; Webb, Gwilym J; Davies, Jim; Barnes, Eleanor; Matthews, Philippa C",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.15.20194985; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.15.20194985v1?rss=1,597

Flaviviruses such as Zika virus (ZIKV) induce reorganization of ER membranes to facilitate viral replication. Here, using 3D super resolution microscopy, ZIKV infection is shown to induce the formation of dense tubular matrices associated with viral replication in the central ER. Viral non-structural proteins NS4B and NS2B associate with replication complexes within the ZIKV-induced tubular matrix and exhibit distinct ER distributions outside this central ER region. Deep neural networks trained to distinguish ZIKV-infected versus mock-infected cells successfully identified ZIKV-induced central ER tubular matrices as a determinant of viral infection. Super resolution microscopy and deep learning are therefore able to identify and localize morphological features of the ER and allow for better understanding of how ER morphology changes due to viral infection.","Long, Rory K.

663249,Commentary on: The Zoom Boom: How Video Calling Impacts Attitudes Towards Aesthetic Surgery in the COVID-19 Era,2021-07-07,"BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have received particular attention because of their ability to modulate the immune system and inhibit inflammation caused by cytokine storms due to SARS-CoV-2. New alternative therapies may reduce mortality rates in patients with COVID19. This study aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of injecting intravenous Wharton’s jelly-derived MSCs in patients with COVID-19 as a treatment. METHODS: In this study, five patients with severe COVID-19 were treated with Wharton’s jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cells (150 × 106 cells per injection). These patients were subject to three intravenous injections 3 days apart, and monitoring was done on days 0, 3, 6, and 14 in routine tests, inflammatory cytokines, and flow cytometry of CD4 and CD8 markers. A lung CT scan was performed on base and days 14 and 28. In addition, IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were measured before and after treatment. RESULTS: The results showed that IL-10 and SDF-1 increased after cell therapy, but VEGF, TGF-β, IFN-γ, IL-6, and TNFα decreased. Routine hematology tests, myocardial enzyme tests, biochemical tests, and inflammation tests were performed for all patients before and after cell therapy on base and days 3, 6, and 14, which indicated the improvement of test results over time. COVID-19 antibody tests rose in 14 days after WJ-MSC injection. The total score of zonal involvement in both lungs was improved. CONCLUSIONS: In patients, the trend of tests was generally improving, and we experienced a reduction in inflammation. No serious complications were observed in patients except the headache in one of them, which was resolved without medication. In this study, we found that patients with severe COVID-19 in the inflammatory phase respond better to cell therapy. More extensive clinical trials should be performed in this regard.

This cross-sectional study involved a survey distributed to 22 Saudi Arabian universities. The survey used in this study consisted of an online learning self-efficacy (OLSE) questionnaire and an electronic learning (e-learning) satisfaction questionnaire. A total of 1,226 respondents voluntarily participated in and completed the survey. Students in medical fields made up 289 (23.6%). A Kruskal–Wallis H test and a chi-square test were used to compare the student’s satisfaction based on the educational variables. Spearman’s correlation and multiple linear regression analyses were performed to assess the association between self-efficacy and satisfaction. The findings revealed degrees of satisfaction ranging between high satisfaction and dissatisfaction. The majority of students (51%) expressed high satisfaction, and 599 students (49%) reported experiencing a low level of satisfaction with e-learning. A comparison of groups with low and high satisfaction scores revealed a significant difference in the OLSE. High satisfaction was positively correlated with the OLSE domains: time management, technology, and learning. The OLSE regression analysis model significantly predicted satisfaction. It showed that the model, corrected for education level and grade point average of the students, significantly predicted e-learning satisfaction (F = 8.04, R(2) = 0.59, p = .004). The study concluded that students’ satisfaction with the e-learning experience is influenced by e-learning self-efficacy. The study’s findings lead to the practical implications and identify the need to improve the remote learning, time management and technology self-efficacy to enhance students’ satisfaction.","Aldhahi, Monira I.; Alqahtani, Abdulfattah S.; Baattaiah, Baian A.; Al-Mohammed, Huda I.",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),https://doi.org/10.1007/s10639-021-10644-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34276239/,597

By incorporating a mechanistic formulation of the processes at the individual level, we obtain an integral equation (delayed in calendar time and advanced in time since infection) for the probability that an infected individual is detected and isolated at any point in time. This is then coupled with a renewal equation for the total incidence to form a closed system describing the transmission dynamics involving contact tracing. We define and calculate basic and effective reproduction numbers in terms of pathogen characteristics and contact tracing implementation constraints. When applied to the case of SARS-CoV-2, our results show that only combinations of diagnosis of symptomatic infections and contact tracing that are almost perfect in terms of speed and coverage can attain control, unless additional measures to reduce overall community transmission are in place. Under constraints on the testing or tracing capacity, a temporary interruption of contact tracing may, depending on the overall growth rate and prevalence of the infection, lead to an irreversible loss of control even when the epidemic was previously contained.","Scarabel, Francesca; Pellis, Lorenzo; Ogden, Nicholas H.; Wu, Jianhong",Royal Society open science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33868698/; https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.202091,597

Numerous studies have demonstrated that the characteristics of COVID-19 disease in pregnant women and non-pregnant women are very similar. However, pregnant women with COVID-19 in the third trimester are more likely than their non-pregnant counterparts to require intensive care, though this may reflect a lower threshold for intervention in pregnant women rather than more serious disease. Compared with pregnant women without COVID-19, pregnant women with symptomatic COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital have worse maternal outcomes, including death, although the absolute risk remains very low. Outcomes of neonates born to women positive for COVID-19 are generally very good, though iatrogenic preterm birth is more common.

Global scale study has already proved the qualitative improvement of air quality but its possible impact at regional level is not investigated yet. Middle catchment of Dwarka river basin of Eastern India is well known for stone quarrying and crushing and therefore the region is highly polluted. The present study has attempted to explore the impact of forced lockdown on environmental components like Particulate matter (PM) 10, Land surface temperature (LST), river water quality, noise using image and field derived data in pre and during lockdown periods. Result clearly exhibits that Maximum PM10 concentration was 189 to 278 μg/m3 in pre lockdown period and it now ranges from 50 to 60 μg/m3 after 18 days of the commencement of lockdown in selected four stone crushing clusters. LST is reduced by 3–5 °C, noise level is dropped to <65dBA which was above 85dBA in stone crusher dominated areas in pre lockdown period. Adjacent river water is qualitatively improved due to stoppage of dust release to the river. For instance, total dissolve solid (TDS) level in river water adjacent to crushing unit is attenuated by almost two times.

This study uses bibliometric methods and network analysis to examine research output and collaboration supporting the SDGs and explores means to detect and analyze research collaboration beyond the traditional definition of multiple, one-time co-authorship. We employed two additional lenses of collaboration: repeat collaboration and collaboration time point to quantify and visualize co-authorship data sourced from Microsoft Academic Graph. Our results show an increased collaboration rate over time at the author and institutional levels; however they also indicate that the majority of collaborations in SDG-related research only happened once. We also found out that on average, repeat collaboration happens more frequently, but after a longer duration, at the institutional level than at the author level. For this reason, we further analyzed institutions and identified core institutions that could help influence more consistent collaboration and sustain or grow the SDG-related research network. Our results have implications for understanding sustainable partnerships in research related to SDGs and other global challenges.","Payumo, Jane; He, Guangming; Manjunatha, Anusha Chintamani; Higgins, Devin; Calvert, Scout",Front Res Metr Anal,https://doi.org/10.3389/frma.2020.612442; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33870065/,597

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a global health emergency. This situation has exacerbated the need for additional healthcare employees, forcing the Spanish government to incorporate volunteer nursing students as auxiliary health staff. DESIGN: A qualitative study framed in the constructivist paradigm. METHODS: Twenty-two students of nursing were recruited. A purposeful sampling was implemented until reaching saturation. A semi-structured interview as a conversational technique was used to collect information based on three dimensions: academic curriculum, disciplinary professional development, and patient care. Subsequently, a content analysis of the information was carried out. Three phases were followed in the data analysis process: theoretical, descriptive-analytical, and interpretive. The COREQ checklist was used to evaluate the study. RESULTS: The most important results are linked to the students’ professional and academic preparation, how the nurses handled the pandemic situation and the characteristics of the COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Students require training in order to offer holistic care to patients, adapted to the context.

A larger, second wave of cases was anticipated the following autumn. To reduce a potential surge of health system utilization without denying needed care, we enlisted the input of experts from medicine, public health, nursing, information technology, and other disciplines to design, test, and deploy clinical algorithms to help minimally trained health care workers and laypeople make informed decisions about care-seeking for influenza-like illness. The product of this collaboration, named Strategy for Off-Site Rapid Triage (SORT) was disseminated in 2 forms. Static algorithms, posted on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Web site, offered guidance to clinicians and telephone call centers on how to manage adults and children with influenza-like illness. In addition, 2 interactive Web sites, http://www.Flu.gov and http://www.H1N1ResponseCenter.com, were created to help adults self-assess their condition and make an informed decision about their need for treatment. Although SORT was anchored in a previously validated clinical decision rule, incorporated the input of expert clinicians, and was subject to small-scale formative evaluations during rapid standup, prospective evaluation is lacking. If its utility and safety are confirmed, SORT may prove to be a useful tool to blunt health system surge and rapidly collect epidemiologic data on future disease outbreaks.","Kellermann, Arthur L.; Isakov, Alexander P.; Parker, Ruth; Handrigan, Michael T.; Foldy, Seth",Ann Emerg Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20605260/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annemergmed.2010.04.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196064410003549; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196064410003549,597
665461,The Importance of Delirium Before and After COVID-19,2021,"Infection of the heart muscle with cardiotropic viruses is one of the major etiologies of myocarditis and acute and chronic inflammatory cardiomyopathy (DCMi). However, viral myocarditis and subsequent dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is still a challenging disease to diagnose and to treat and is therefore a significant public health issue globally. Advances in clinical examination and thorough molecular genetic analysis of intramyocardial viruses and their activation status have incrementally improved our understanding of molecular pathogenesis and pathophysiology of viral infections of the heart muscle. To date, several cardiotropic viruses have been implicated as causes of myocarditis and DCMi. These include, among others, classical cardiotropic enteroviruses (coxsackieviruses B), the most commonly detected parvovirus B19, and human herpes virus 6. A newcomer is the respiratory virus that has triggered the worst pandemic in a century, SARS-CoV-2, whose involvement and impact in viral cardiovascular disease is under scrutiny. Despite extensive research into the pathomechanisms of viral infections of the cardiovascular system, our knowledge regarding their treatment and management is still incomplete. Accordingly, in this review we aim to explore and summarize the current knowledge and available evidence on viral infections of the heart. We focus on diagnostics, clinical relevance and cardiovascular consequences, pathophysiology, and current and novel treatment strategies.","Schultheiss, Heinz-Peter; Baumeier, Christian; Pietsch, Heiko; Bock, C Thomas; Poller, Wolfgang; Escher, Felicitas",Cardiovasc Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34609508/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cvr/cvab315,597

666340,"Join Together, Even in a Time of Distancing",2020-08-31,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 can induce a hyperinflammatory state, which might lead to poor clinical outcomes. We aimed to assess whether patients with a systemic rheumatic disease might be at increased risk for hyperinflammation and respiratory failure from COVID-19. METHODS: We did a retrospective, comparative cohort study of patients aged 18 years or older admitted to hospital with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 at Mass General Brigham (Boston, USA). We identified patients by a search of electronic health records and matched patients with a systemic rheumatic disease 1:5 to comparators. We compared individual laboratory results by case status and extracted laboratory results and COVID-19 outcomes for each participant. We calculated the COVID-19-associated hyperinflammation score (cHIS), a composite of six domains (a score of ≥2 indicating hyperinflammation) and used logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for COVID-19 outcomes by hyperinflammation and case status. FINDINGS: We identified 57 patients with a systemic rheumatic disease and 232 matched comparators who were admitted to hospital with COVID-19 between Jan 30 and July 7, 2020; 38 (67%) patients with a rheumatic disease were female compared with 158 (68%) matched comparators. Patients with a systemic rheumatic disease had higher peak median neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (9·6 [IQR 6·4–22·2] vs 7·8 [4·5–16·5]; p=0·021), lactate dehydrogenase concentration (421 U/L [297–528] vs 345 U/L [254–479]; p=0·044), creatinine concentration (1·2 mg/dL [0·9–2·0] vs 1·0 mg/dL [0·8–1·4], p=0·014), and blood urea nitrogen concentration (31 mg/dL [15–61] vs 23 mg/dL [13–37]; p=0·033) than comparators, but median C-reactive protein concentration (149·4 mg/L [76·4–275·3] vs 116·3 mg/L [58·8–225·9]; p=0·11) was not significantly different. Patients with a systemic rheumatic disease had higher peak median cHIS than comparators (3 [1–5] vs 2 [1–4]; p=0·013). All patients with a peak cHIS of 2 or more had higher odds of admission to intensive care (OR 3·45 [95% CI 1·98–5·99]), mechanical ventilation (66·20 [8·98–487·80]), and in-hospital mortality (16·37 [4·75–56·38]) than patients with a peak cHIS of less than 2. In adjusted analyses, patients with a rheumatic disease had higher odds of admission to intensive care (2·08 [1·09–3·96]) and mechanical ventilation (2·60 [1·32–5·12]) than comparators, but not in-hospital mortality (1.78 [0·79–4·02]). Among patients who were discharged from hospital, risk of rehospitalisation (1·08 [0·37–3·16]) and mortality within 60 days (1·20 [0·58–2·47]) was similar in patients and comparators. INTERPRETATION: Patients with a systemic rheumatic disease who were admitted to hospital for COVID-19 had increased risk for hyperinflammation, kidney injury, admission to intensive care, and mechanical ventilation compared with matched comparators. However, among patients who survived, post-discharge outcomes were not significantly different. The cHIS identified patients with hyperinflammation, which was strongly associated with poor COVID-19 outcomes in both patients with a rheumatic disease and comparators. Clinicians should be aware that patients with systemic rheumatic diseases and COVID-19 could be susceptible to hyperinflammation and poor hospital outcomes.

This idea requires the ability of such systems to ‘tinker’, i.e., to creatively respond to changes in their environment. A fairly obvious example of this is natural selection-driven evolution. In this ubiquitous process, an original entity, challenged by an ever-changing environment, creates variants that evolve into novel entities. Analyzing functions that are essential during stationary-state life yield examples of entities that may be antifragile. One such example is proteins with flexible regions that can undergo functional alteration of their side residues or backbone and thus implement the tinkering that leads to antifragility. This in-built property of the cell chassis must be taken into account when considering construction of cell factories driven by engineering principles.","Danchin, Antoine; Binder, Philippe M.; Noria, Stanislas",Genes (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/genes2040998; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24710302/,597

Along with the cost of isolation, we define a healthcare cost and a total cost. We explore these costs by adjusting parameters that could change with policy decisions. We observe that minimum costs are not always associated with increased spending and increased vigilance which is due to the desire for people to not distance and the fatigue they experience when they do. We demonstrate that an increased in the number of lock-downs, each of shorter duration can lead to minimal costs.

Platform choice and usage patterns appear to vary by specialty and purpose, but few studies comprehensively assess programs’ social media presence. Prior studies assessed general surgery departments’ Twitter use but omitted additional social media platforms and residency-specific accounts. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to broadly characterize the social media footprint of U.S. general surgery residency programs. METHODS: Using a protocolized search of program websites, social media platforms (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn), and internet search, cross-sectional data on social media usage in March 2020 were collected for programs, their affiliated departments, their program directors (PDs), and their assistant/associate PDs (APDs). RESULTS: 318 general surgery residency programs, 313 PDs, and 296 APDs were identified. 47.2% of programs had surgery-specific accounts on ≥1 platform. 40.2% of PDs and APDs had ≥1 account on Twitter and/or LinkedIn. Program type was associated with social media adoption and Twitter utilization, with lower usage among university-affiliated and independent programs (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Most general surgery residencies, especially non-university-based programs, lacked any department or residency accounts across Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram by March 2020. These findings highlight opportunities for increased social media engagement and act as a pre-pandemic baseline for future investigations of how the shift to virtual trainee education, recruitment, conferences, and clinical care affect social media use.","White, Erin M.; Rohde, Stefanie C.; Ruzgar, Nensi M.; Chan, Shin Mei; Esposito, Andrew C.; Oliveira, Kristin D.; Yoo, Peter S.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34191853/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253787,597

In the months following the global spread of SARS-CoV-2, the lack of effective pharmaceutical interventions led to widespread implementation of behavioral interventions aimed at reducing contacts and transmission. In the US, state and local governments introduced and enforced the bulk of interventions, including university closures. As universities closed, student departures decreased the total population size of college towns while state-level interventions decreased contacts among remaining residents. Though the pandemic continues without pharmaceutical interventions, businesses have begun to reopen, and many universities have resumed operations. These actions have increased contacts and population sizes in college towns. Monitoring movement to implement adaptive policies will be critical for outbreak management. Methods. We use publicly available remotely-sensed nighttime lights and traffic cameras to measure the impact of restriction policies on movement and activities in the university town of State College, and the surrounding areas of Centre County, Pennsylvania, USA. Results. At the county level, nighttime radiance did not differ significantly across restriction phases and largely reflected seasonal fluctuations seen in previous years. Throughout the county, traffic volumes were lowest during the most severe period of restrictions ('Red phase' in Pennsylvania). As restrictions eased, traffic volumes grew, indicating increased movement within and between population centers. We show that real-time, publicly available traffic data captured behavioral responses and compliance to different restrictions phases. We also demonstrate that these increases in activity levels precede increases in reported COVID-19 cases. Conclusion. Passively collected data can measure population-level movement in response to restrictions and changes in these measured movements are reflected in observed SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Measuring these changes in movements and contacts in near real time can inform local adaptive interventions to curtail outbreaks.","Faust, C. L.; Lambert, B.; Kochenour, C.; Robinson, A.

Yet, before population declines are detectable, individuals may suffer from chronic stress and impaired immunity in disturbed habitats, making them more susceptible to pathogens and adverse weather conditions. Here, we tested in a paleotropical forest with ongoing logging and fragmentation, whether habitat disturbance influences the body mass and immunity of bats. We measured and compared body mass, chronic stress (indicated by neutrophil to lymphocyte ratios) and the number of circulating immune cells between several bat species with different roost types living in recovering areas, actively logged forests, and fragmented forests in Sabah, Malaysia. In a cave-roosting species, chronic stress levels were higher in individuals from fragmented habitats compared with conspecifics from actively logged areas. Foliage-roosting species showed a reduced body mass and decrease in total white blood cell counts in actively logged areas and fragmented forests compared with conspecifics living in recovering habitats. Our study highlights that habitat disturbance may have species-specific effects on chronic stress and immunity in bats that are potentially related to the roost type. We identified foliage-roosting species as particularly sensitive to forest habitat deterioration.

We aimed to investigate whether COVID-19 and SARS exhibited similar spatial and temporal features at the provincial level in mainland China. Methods: The number of people infected by COVID-19 and SARS were extracted from daily briefings on newly confirmed cases during the epidemics, as of Mar. 4, 2020 and Aug. 3, 2003, respectively. We depicted the spatiotemporal patterns of the COVID-19 and SARS epidemics using spatial statistics such as Moran's I and the local indicators of spatial association (LISA). Results: Compared to SARS, COVID-19 had a higher incidence. We identified 3 clusters (predominantly located in south-central China, highest RR=135.08) for COVID-19 and 4 clusters (mainly in Northern China, highest RR=423.51) for SARS. Fewer secondary clusters were identified after the “Wuhan lockdown”. The LISA cluster map detected a significantly high-low (Hubei) and low-high spatial clustering (Anhui, Hunan, and Jiangxi, in Central China) for COVID-19. Two significant high-high (Beijing and Tianjin) and low-high (Hebei) clusters were detected for SARS, although the global Moran's I value was not significant. Conclusions: The different spatiotemporal clustering patterns between COVID-19 and SARS could point to changes in social and demographic factors, local government containment strategies or differences in transmission mechanisms between these coronaviruses.","Zhang, Xi; Rao, Hua-Xiang; Wu, Yuwan; Huang, Yubei; Dai, Hongji",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.23.20034058,597

Meanwhile, the rapid development of Internet service, especially its application on mobile devices, brings many new contents of prosocial behaviors (PBs), which benefits both individuals and communities. Specifically, social currency plays a positive role in promoting PB, forming positive personalities, promoting positive social adaptation, and contributing to human survival and social development. However, the theoretical research in this field still lags far behind the development of practice, and the research on the impact of social currency on PB remains exceedingly scarce. Grounded in the social exchange theory (SET), the present study collects a total of 497 WeChat user questionnaires, constructs a model for the influence mechanism of social currency on PB, and tests the hypothesis through hierarchical regression. According to the results obtained, it was found that the social currency is positively associated with PB, and users with a more social currency are more likely to act prosocially on their own. The PB of an individual is then influenced by the social currency generated through collective self-esteem (CS) so that the perception of CS can be considered as a mediating variable. Moreover, the communication network heterogeneity (CNH) moderates the above relationship, and the degree of heterogeneity will have different effects on the relationship of CS. The obtained conclusions enrich the previous theoretical results of PB and provided new insights for social managers to enhance the prosocial-related behaviors for the group, organization, and society.","Gong, Xiaoxiao; Ye, Zuoliang; Liu, Binjie; Yu, Shengxian; Yan, Yufei",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.672505; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34566753/,597

We analyze the chances of the survival of the virus present in the droplet based on the lifetime of the droplets under several conditions and find that the chances of the survival of the virus are strongly affected by each of these parameters. The magnitude of shear stress inside the droplet computed using the model is not large enough to obliterate the virus.

The impact of social confinement and the interruption of this surgery on the population with obesity has been underestimated, with weight gain and worsened comorbidities. Some candidates for this surgery are exposed to a high risk of mortality linked to the pandemic. Obesity and diabetes are two major risk factors for severe forms of Covid-19. The only currently effective treatment for obesity is metabolic surgery, which confers prompt, lasting benefits. It is thus necessary to resume such surgery.To ensure that this resumption is both gradual and well-founded, we have devised a priority ranking plan. The flow charts we propose will help centres to identify priority patients according to a benefit/risk assessment. Diabetes holds a central place in the decision tree. Resumption patterns will vary from one centre to another according to human, physical and medical resources, and will need adjustment as the epidemic unfolds.Specific informed consent will be required.

669386,COVID‐19 dentistry‐related aspects: a literature overview,2020-07-05,"Although the number of people with disabilities and types of disability increases day by day, a sufficient point has not been reached regarding accessible tourism. The participation rate of people with disabilities (PWDS) in tourism activities is low, and there is a big gap in the travel and accommodation sector in this regard. Studies of previous scholars have concluded that the accessible tourism market is a significant and profitable area, but determinants of participation to travel and process of travel, such as wheelchair user expectations, are consistently ignored by the tourism industry. The main purpose of this study is to determine the determinants of travel by examining the motivations, expectations, processes and experiences of PWDS using wheelchairs to participate in tourism. Research was performed in Turkey’s Bodrum district; 25 wheelchair users were included in the study. The keywords that emerged in the theoretical framework in light of the answers given to 39 open-ended questions online were coded in the Nvivo program. The results showed that wheelchair users intended to go on vacation but were less motivated to participate due to the lack of travel conditions. Wheelchair travelers argued that a companion was required for an enjoyable holiday that could meet their needs. In addition, the results revealed that the types of wheelchairs used by disabled passengers differ. The disabled stated that the wheelchairs they use in daily life are not suitable for use on the beach, sand or water. Despite the economic, social and technological change opportunities, basic tourism service expectations of PWDS are not met. This research project is a comprehensive study that makes determinations in terms of examining the social status of disabled people in terms of social sciences, examining the place and importance of disabled tourists in the market and eliminating the deficiencies of facilities serving in tourism.","Özcan, Ezgi; Güçhan Topcu, Zehra; Arasli, Hüseyin",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33668163/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18052218,597

It is documented that the virus can be transmitted to newborn babies from their mothers. We consider a deterministic model for the transmission dynamics of the Zika virus infectious disease that spreads in, both humans and vectors, through horizontal and vertical transmission. The total populations of both humans and mosquitoes are assumed to be constant. Our models consist of a system of eight differential equations describing the human and vector populations during the different stages of the disease. We have included the hospitalization/isolation class in our model to see the effect of the controlling strategy. We determine the expression for the basic reproductive number R(0) in terms of horizontal as well as vertical disease transmission rates. An in-depth stability analysis of the model is performed, and it is consequently shown, that the model has a globally asymptotically stable disease-free equilibrium when the basic reproduction number R(0) < 1. It is also shown that when R(0) > 1, there exists a unique endemic equilibrium. We showed that the endemic equilibrium point is globally asymptotically stable when it exists. We were able to prove this result in a reduced model. Furthermore, we conducted an uncertainty and sensitivity analysis to recognize the impact of crucial model parameters on R(0). The uncertainty analysis yields an estimated value of the basic reproductive number R(0) = 1.54. Assuming infection prevalence in the population under constant control, optimal control theory is used to devise an optimal hospitalization/isolation control strategy for the model. The impact of isolation on the number of infected individuals and the accumulated cost is assessed and compared with the constant control case.","Imran, Mudassar; Usman, Muhammad; Malik, Tufail; Ansari, Ali R.",Virus Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170218303241; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30003923/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2018.07.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170218303241,597

Increased blood lactate is common in intensive care unit (ICU) patients; however, its association with outcomes in ICU COVID-19 patients remains currently unexplored. In this retrospective, observational study we assessed whether lactate is associated with outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Blood lactate was measured on ICU admission and thereafter daily up to day 14 in 45 patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. Acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE II) was calculated on ICU admission, and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score was assessed on admission and every second day. The cohort was divided into survivors and non-survivors based on 28-day ICU mortality (24.4%). Cox regression analysis revealed that maximum lactate on admission was independently related to 28-day ICU mortality with time in the presence of APACHE II (RR = 2.45, p = 0.008). Lactate’s area under the curve for detecting 28-day ICU mortality was 0.77 (p = 0.008). Mixed model analysis showed that mean daily lactate levels were higher in non-survivors (p < 0.0001); the model applied on SOFA scores showed a similar time pattern. Thus, initial blood lactate was an independent outcome predictor in COVID-19 ICU patients. The time course of lactate mirrors organ dysfunction and is associated with poor clinical outcomes.","Vassiliou, Alice G.; Jahaj, Edison; Ilias, Ioannis; Markaki, Vassiliki; Malachias, Sotirios; Vrettou, Charikleia; Ischaki, Eleni; Mastora, Zafeiria; Douka, Evangelia; Keskinidou, Chrysi; Tsipilis, Stamatios; Vassiliadi, Dimitra A.; Kotanidou, Anastasia; Dimopoulou, Ioanna",Metabolites,https://doi.org/10.3390/metabo10100386; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32998323/,597

DESIGN: Investigator initiated, monocentre, nTreg dose escalation, phase I/IIa clinical trial (ONEnTreg13). SETTING: Charité-University Hospital, Berlin, Germany, within the ONE study consortium (funded by the European Union). PARTICIPANTS: Recipients of living donor kidney transplant (ONEnTreg13, n=11) and corresponding reference group trial (ONErgt11-CHA, n=9). INTERVENTIONS: CD4+ CD25+ FoxP3+ nTreg products were given seven days after kidney transplantation as one intravenous dose of 0.5, 1.0, or 2.5-3.0×10(6) cells/kg body weight, with subsequent stepwise tapering of triple immunosuppression to low dose tacrolimus monotherapy until week 48. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary clinical and safety endpoints were assessed by a composite endpoint at week 60 with further three year follow-up. The assessment included incidence of biopsy confirmed acute rejection, assessment of nTreg infusion related adverse effects, and signs of over immunosuppression. Secondary endpoints addressed allograft functions. Accompanying research included a comprehensive exploratory biomarker portfolio. RESULTS: For all patients, nTreg products with sufficient yield, purity, and functionality could be generated from 40-50 mL of peripheral blood taken two weeks before kidney transplantation. None of the three nTreg dose escalation groups had dose limiting toxicity. The nTreg and reference groups had 100% three year allograft survival and similar clinical and safety profiles. Stable monotherapy immunosuppression was achieved in eight of 11 (73%) patients receiving nTregs, while the reference group remained on standard dual or triple drug immunosuppression (P=0.002). Mechanistically, the activation of conventional T cells was reduced and nTregs shifted in vivo from a polyclonal to an oligoclonal T cell receptor repertoire. CONCLUSIONS: The application of autologous nTregs was safe and feasible even in patients who had a kidney transplant and were immunosuppressed. These results warrant further evaluation of Treg efficacy and serve as the basis for the development of next generation nTreg approaches in transplantation and any immunopathologies.

Sixteen Holstein bulls and 14 heifers with a body weight (BW) of 44.3 ± 5.24 kg were blocked by birth date in a randomized complete block design. Calves were removed from the dam before suckling, weighed, and randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatments: (1) colostrum replacer (CR) at 0 h with no meloxicam (control; CON), (2) 1 mg/kg of BW of meloxicam in pill form before CR (PL), or (3) 1 mg/kg of BW of meloxicam mixed in solution with CR (SL). Calves were fed 675 g of dry matter of CR, providing a volume of 3 L and 180 g of IgG. Blood samples were collected at 0 h to analyze initial IgG and ketone concentrations, and at 6, 12, 18, and 24 h to analyze IgG uptake. At 24 h, calves were fed 432 g of dry matter of 24% crude protein milk replacer (MR) split in 2 feedings, and free choice starter and water until 42 d. Weekly blood samples were analyzed for glucose, plasma urea nitrogen, and ketone concentrations. Time of consumption of MR, BW, length, hip and withers height, and heart girth were recorded weekly. All calves achieved adequate transfer of immunity. Meloxicam did not affect apparent efficiency of absorption, serum total protein, or IgG uptake at 6, 18, and 24 h; however, meloxicam-treated calves had lesser IgG concentrations at 12 h (24.40 and 22.59 g/L for PL and SL, respectively) compared with CON (28.47 g/L). Meloxicam treatment did not affect BW. Calves that received PL tended to gain length at a faster rate (0.24 cm/d) than those that received SL (0.19 cm/d). Meloxicam treatment did not affect MR intake, time of consumption of MR, total dry matter intake, or feed efficiency. Meloxicam-treated calves tended to consume more starter (560.4 and 515.4 g/d for PL and SL, respectively) than those that received CON (452.6 g/d). Ketone levels tended to be greater in meloxicam-treated calves (0.15 and 0.17 mmol/L for PL and SL, respectively), suggesting improved rumen development compared with those that received CON (0.12 mmol/L). Meloxicam treatment did not affect plasma urea nitrogen . Glucose concentrations of calves that received PL (73.2 mg/dL) were less than those that received SL (83.3 mg/dL). Results of this study suggest that meloxicam given at 0 h offers positive effects on starter intake, and possibly rumen development, of preweaned dairy calves.

This paper aims to demonstrate the proof-of-principle of an innovative sEMG sensor system, which can be used intuitively by patients while detecting their muscular activation with sufficient accuracy. The sEMG sensor system utilizes a multichannel approach based on 16 sEMG leads arranged circularly around the limb. Its design enables a stable contact between the skin surface and the system’s dry electrodes, fulfills the SENIAM recommendations regarding the electrode size and inter-electrode distance and facilitates a high temporal resolution. The proof-of-principle was demonstrated by elbow flexion/extension movements of 10 subjects, proving that it has root mean square values and a signal-to-noise ratio comparable to commercial systems based on pre-gelled electrodes. Furthermore, it can be easily placed and removed by patients with reduced arm function and without detailed knowledge about the exact positioning of the sEMG electrodes.

METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted in the PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and MedRxiv Database from 1 January 2020 to 26 May 2021. RESULTS: 15 studies with 135,263 COVID-19 patients were included for analysis of ILD prevalence. The pooled prevalence of comorbid ILD in patients with COVID-19 was 1.4% (95% CI, 1.1%-1.8%, I(2) = 91%) with significant between-study heterogeneity. Moreover, the prevalence of ILD in non-survival patients with COVID-19 was 2.728-folds higher than that in corresponding survival patients (RR = 2.728, 95% CI 1.162–6.408, I(2) = 54%, p = 0.021). Additionally, 2–3 studies were included for comparison analysis of clinical outcome between COVID-19 patients with and without ILD. The results showed that the mortality of COVID-19 patients with ILD was remarkably elevated compared with patients without ILD (RR = 2.454, 95% CI 1.111–5.421, I(2) = 87%, p = 0.026).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred fifty-two immunocompromised patients with pulmonary complications that showed extensive GGA (> 50% of the whole lung on HRCT) were included in this study. The diagnoses of the 152 patients were as follows: pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), n = 82; drug-induced pneumonia, n = 38; bacterial pneumonia, n = 9; cytomegalovirus pneumonia, n = 6; idiopathic pneumonia syndrome, n = 6; diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), n = 4; fungal infection, n = 3; tuberculosis, n = 2 and pulmonary edema, n = 2.

The ILS thickening was significantly frequent in drug-induced pneumonia (p < 0.001) though it was also frequent in other noninfectious and infectious diseases. The BVB thickening was significantly frequent in bacterial pneumonia (p = 0.005). The nodule was significantly frequent in DAH (p = 0.049). CONCLUSION: Nodules, BVB thickening, and ILS thickening could be useful HRCT findings for the differential diagnosis of pulmonary complications in immunocompromised patients with extensive GGA.","Kunihiro, Yoshie; Tanaka, Nobuyuki; Kawano, Reo; Matsumoto, Tsuneo; Kobayashi, Taiga; Yujiri, Toshiaki; Kubo, Makoto; Gondo, Toshikazu; Ito, Katsuyoshi",Jpn J Radiol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11604-021-01122-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33945100/,597
674032,Improving Stroke Care in Times of the COVID-19 Pandemic Through Simulation: Practice Your Protocols!,2020-05-26,"Background: The Veterans Health Administration COVID-19 (VACO) Index incorporates age, sex, and pre-existing comorbidity diagnoses readily available in the electronic health record (EHR) to predict 30-day all-cause mortality in both inpatients and outpatients infected with SARS-CoV-2. We examined the performance of the Index using data from Yale New Haven Hospital (YNHH) and national Medicare data overall, over time, and within important patient subgroups. Methods and findings: With measures and weights previously derived and validated in a national Veterans Healthcare Administration (VA) sample, we evaluated the accuracy of the VACO Index for estimating inpatient (YNHH) and both inpatient and outpatient mortality (Medicare) using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and comparisons of predicted versus observed mortality by decile (calibration plots). The VACO Index demonstrated similar discrimination and calibration in both settings, over time, and among important patient subgroups including women, Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and Native Americans. In sensitivity analyses, we allowed component variables to be re-weighted in the validation datasets and found that weights were largely consistent with those determined in VA data. Supplementing the VACO Index with body mass index and race/ethnicity had no effect on discrimination. Conclusion: Among COVID-19 positive individuals, the VACO Index accurately estimates risk of short-term mortality among a wide variety of patients. While it modestly over-estimates risk in recent intervals, the Index consistently identifies those at greatest relative risk. The VACO Index could identify individuals who should continue practicing social distancing, help determine who should be prioritized for vaccination, and among outpatients who test positive for SARS-CoV-2, indicate who should receive greater clinical attention or monoclonal antibodies.","King, J.

674377,Clinical research during the COVID-19 pandemic: gastroenterology researchers’ perspective,2020-07-29,"Background: Adherence to novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) appropriate behavior plays a crucial element in the management of the infections of COVID-19. Despite the importance of transmission-reducing behaviors among healthcare professionals, there is a lack of literature in this area of research explicitly relating to respiratory therapists (RTs). Therefore, it is essential to assess the adherence level to COVID-19 transmission-reducing behaviors among the RTs in Saudi Arabia. Methods: A web-based online survey was conducted using questions based on the risk assessment guidelines of WHO. A random representative sample of RTs (N = 215) residing in Saudi Arabia was recruited for the study. Descriptive and inferential statistics were computed using STATA software. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify key factors that are associated with adherence to COVID-19 appropriate behavior among the study participants. Results: Of the 215 participants, 59.5% were aged between 26 and 35 years, and 40.9% were women. Most (85.5%) participants had a bachelor's degree while 12.0% had a master's degree. About 56.2% of RTs provided direct care to a confirmed patient of COVID-19 during the study periods. The study showed 80.9% of RTs in Saudi Arabia adhered to personal protective equipment (PPE) at the workplace and 65.0% at home. Moreover, the findings of the study indicated that senior RTs (with >5 years of experience) demonstrated a higher adherence level to the guidelines than RTs with <5 years of experience. High-risk perception [aOR:2.32; 95% CI: 1.09–3.27], and work history of <5 years [aOR:2.00; 95% CI: 1.14–3.15], were found to be the strongest predictors in explaining the adherence to appropriate behavior among the RTs at the workplace. Whereas the high-risk perception [aOR:2.32; 95% CI: 1.09–3.27] and being married [aOR:1.85; 95% CI: 1.08–3.82] were found to be the strongest predictors at home. Conclusion: Adherence (“Always” or “Most times”) to COVID-19 appropriate behavior was found to be high at hospital settings among the study participants. However, the same practice was found to be inconsistence in non-healthcare settings among the RTs. Considering the paramount role of COVID-19 appropriate behavior in reducing the transmissions the policy focus, therefore, needs to be on creating a well-spread behavior change communication that is curtailing the adoption of appropriate behavior in the non-healthcare settings.","Al Khathlan, Noor; Padhi, Bijaya Kumar",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34490196/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.715982,597
674477,The importance of distinguishing COVID-19 from more common respiratory illnesses,2020-09-02,"BACKGROUND: Through a combination of strong routine immunization (RI), strategic supplemental immunization activities (SIA) and robust surveillance, numerous countries have been able to approach or achieve measles elimination. The fragility of these achievements has been shown, however, by the resurgence of measles since 2016. We describe trends in routine measles vaccine coverage at national and district level, SIA performance and demographic changes in the three regions with the highest measles burden. FINDINGS: WHO-UNICEF estimates of immunization coverage show that global coverage of the first dose of measles vaccine has stabilized at 85% from 2015 to 19. In 2000, 17 countries in the WHO African and Eastern Mediterranean regions had measles vaccine coverage below 50%, and although all increased coverage by 2019, at a median of 60%, it remained far below levels needed for elimination. Geospatial estimates show many low coverage districts across Africa and much of the Eastern Mediterranean and southeast Asian regions. A large proportion of children unvaccinated for MCV live in conflict-affected areas with remote rural areas and some urban areas also at risk. Countries with low RI coverage use SIAs frequently, yet the ideal timing and target age range for SIAs vary within countries, and the impact of SIAs has often been mitigated by delays or disruptions. SIAs have not been sufficient to achieve or sustain measles elimination in the countries with weakest routine systems. Demographic changes also affect measles transmission, and their variation between and within countries should be incorporated into strategic planning. CONCLUSIONS: Rebuilding services after the COVID-19 pandemic provides a need and an opportunity to increase community engagement in planning and monitoring services. A broader suite of interventions is needed beyond SIAs. Improved methods for tracking coverage at the individual and community level are needed together with enhanced surveillance. Decision-making needs to be decentralized to develop locally-driven, sustainable strategies for measles control and elimination.","Cutts, F. T.; Ferrari, M. J.; Krause, L. K.; Tatem, A.

675197,Acceptable Performance of the Abbott ID NOW Among Symptomatic Individuals with Confirmed COVID-19,2020-12-30,"Introduction Generalized immunization against COVID19 has become the cornerstone in prevention of associated severe acute respiratory syndrome. Maintenance dialysis patients (MDP) are at higher risk of both exposure and mortality from the disease. Efficacy and security of BNT162b2 vaccine is well documented for the general population, but not in MDP, particularly in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. This study aims to compare humoral response between HD and PD patients. Materials and Methods Observational prospective study including MDP on HD or PD program from a Portuguese middle-sized Nephrology Center, who received BNT162b2. Specific anti-Spike IgG was measured as arbitrary units per milliliter (AU/mL) on two separate occasions: 3 weeks after the first dose and 3 weeks after the second. The two modality groups were compared both for absolute value and number of non-responders (NR) after both inoculations. Demographic data was also obtained and compared. Results Of 73 patients enrolled, 67 were eligible for the final study: 42 HD and 25 PD patients. PD group developed significantly higher antibody titers both after first (Med 5.44 vs 0.99; p<0.01) and second dose (Med 170.43 vs 65.81; p<0.01). HD status was associated with non-responding after the first dose (Phi=0.383; p<0.01), but not after the second one (p=0.08). Age, Charlson Comorbidity Index and dialysis vintage were lower in the PD group (p<0.01; p=0.02; p<0.01, respectively). Conclusion This study demonstrated a better humoral response to immunization with BNT162b2 in PD patients, when comparing to HD patients, after both inoculations. Both groups showed substantial humoral response after just one dose of the vaccine. Older age and higher comorbidity burden may explain the relative immunogenicity deficit, probably in a superior degree comparing with age matched healthy population.","Duarte, R.

676286,COVID-19 and schools. Guidelines of the French Pediatric Society,2020-09-04,"Coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) is a harmful disease caused by the new SARS‐CoV‐2 virus. COVID‐19 disease comprises symptoms such as cold, cough, fever, and difficulty in breathing. COVID‐19 has affected many countries and their spread in the world has put humanity at risk. Due to the increasing number of cases and their stress on administration as well as health professionals, different prediction techniques were introduced to predict the coronavirus disease existence in patients. However, the accuracy was not improved, and time consumption was not minimized during the disease prediction. To address these problems, least square regressive Gaussian neuro‐fuzzy multi‐layered data classification (LSRGNFM‐LDC) technique is introduced in this article. LSRGNFM‐LDC technique performs efficient COVID prediction with better accuracy and lesser time consumption through feature selection and classification. The preprocessing is used to eliminate the unwanted data in input features. Preprocessing is applied to reduce the time complexity. Next, Deming Least Square Regressive Feature Selection process is carried out for selecting the most relevant features through identifying the line of best fit. After the feature selection process, Gaussian neuro‐fuzzy classifier in LSRGNFM‐LDC technique performs the data classification process with help of fuzzy if‐then rules for performing prediction process. Finally, the fuzzy if‐then rule classifies the patient data as lower risk level, medium risk level and higher risk level with higher accuracy and lesser time consumption. Experimental evaluation is performed by Novel Corona Virus 2019 Dataset using different metrics like prediction accuracy, prediction time, and error rate. The result shows that LSRGNFM‐LDC technique improves the accuracy and minimizes the time consumption as well as error rate than existing works during COVID prediction.","Mydukuri, Rathnamma V; Kallam, Suresh; Patan, Rizwan; Al‐Turjman, Fadi; Ramachandran, Manikandan",Expert Syst,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34230740/; https://doi.org/10.1111/exsy.12694,597

There is a smaller evidence base on the health of DVA perpetrators and their engagement with healthcare services. This review examines the experiences of perpetrators of DVA of accessing healthcare services and the barriers and facilitators to their disclosure of abusive behaviours in these settings. DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-synthesis of qualitative studies. DATA SOURCES: A systematic search was conducted in Cochrane, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, HMIC, BNID, CINAHL, ASSIA, IBSS, SSCI (peer-reviewed literature) and NDLTD, OpenGrey and SCIE Online (grey literature). Each database was searched from its start date to 15 March 2020. Eligibility criteria required that studies used qualitative or mixed methods to report on the experiences of healthcare use by perpetrators of DVA. A meta-ethnographic method was used to analyse the extracted data. RESULTS: Of 30,663 papers identified, six studies (n=125 participants; 124 men, 1 woman) met the inclusion criteria. Barriers to disclosure of DVA to healthcare staff included perpetrators’ negative emotions and attitudes towards their abusive behaviours; fear of consequences of disclosure; and lack of trust in healthcare services’ ability to address DVA. Facilitators of disclosure of DVA and engagement with healthcare services were experiencing social consequences of abusive behaviours; feeling listened to by healthcare professionals; and offers of emotional and practical support for relationship problems by healthcare staff. CONCLUSIONS: DVA perpetration is a complex issue with multiple barriers to healthcare engagement and disclosure.

Therefore, this study inspects the mental health status, behavioral response, and perception among HCWs (nurses, physicians, and medical laboratory workers) during the COVID-19 pandemic in public health care facilities. Methods: A facilities-based cross-sectional study was conducted in July 2020. A simple random sampling technique was used to select study participants. Data were collected by self-report administered questionnaires using Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) for depression, General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) for anxiety, Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) for insomnia, Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) for psychological distress, Perceived Threat Scale for perception, and Behavioral Response Inquiry for the behavioral response. Moreover, bivariable and multivariable logistic regressions analysis was used to identify the association between dependent and independent variables at p-value <0.05. Results: A total of 417 (98.6%) HCWs responded to a self-administered questionnaire. The proportion of HCWs who had moderate to severe symptoms of psychological distress, depression, anxiety, and insomnia during the COVID-19 pandemic were 58, 16.3, 30.7, and 15.9%, respectively. Three-fifth of the nurses, medical laboratory professionals (62.2%), and physicians (59.2%) had reported good behavioral responses toward the COVID-19 pandemic. More than three-fifths of the nurses had reported poor perception toward the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: COVID-19 Taskforce was established to formulate standardized scenario-based simulation training materials in late-January 2020. Post-training questionnaires made up of 5-point Likert scales were distributed to all participants to evaluate their personal strengths, in terms of i) assertiveness, ii) mental preparedness, iii) self-efficacy, iv) internal locus of control, and v) internal locus of responsibility. Independent sample t-tests were used to analyze between-group difference in “In-situ” and “Lab-based” group; and one-sample t-tests were used to compare change in personal strengths with reference point of 3 (Neutral). Kirkpatrick’s Model served as the analytical framework for overall training effects. RESULTS: Between 05 February and 18 March 2020, 101 sessions of simulation training were conducted in “In-Situ” at either Accident & Emergency Department (20, 20%) or Intensive Care Unit (15, 14%) and “Lab-based” for Isolation (30, 30%) and General Wards (36, 36%). 1,415 hospital staff members, including 1,167 nurses (82%), 163 doctors (12%) and 85 patient care assistants (6%), were trained. All domains of personal strengths were scored 4.24 or above and statistically significantly increased when comparing with reference population (p < .001). However, no significant differences between in-situ and lab-based simulation were found (p > .05), for all domains of personal strengths. CONCLUSION: Healthcare simulation training enhanced healthcare workers’ personal strengths critical to operational and clinical outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Cheung, Victor Kai-Lam; So, Eric Hang-Kwong; Ng, George Wing-Yiu; So, CC Sze-Sze; Hung, Jeff Leung-Kit; Chia, Nam-Hung",Integr Med Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32802743/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213422020301086?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imr.2020.100476; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213422020301086,597

Handling of biological samples from individuals infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus requires strict biosafety and biosecurity measures. Within the laboratory, non-propagative work with samples containing the virus requires, at minimum, Biosafety Level-2 (BSL-2) techniques and facilities. Therefore, handling of SARS-CoV-2 samples remains a major concern in areas and conditions where biosafety and biosecurity for specimen handling is difficult to maintain, such as in rural laboratories or austere field testing sites. Inactivation through physical or chemical means can reduce the risk of handling live virus and increase testing ability worldwide.

The conjugation between oligonucleotide sequence of the PCR products and the MagPlex-TAG microspheres was specific without any cross-reaction, and the hybridization products could be analyzed using the Luminex 200 analyzer instrument. Recombinant plasmids were constructed to estimate the detection limit of the viruses. Furthermore, 40 clinical samples were used to evaluate the efficiency of this multiplex PCR based Luminex x-TAG assay. RESULTS: According to the results, this new method showed high specificity and good stability. Assessed by the recombinant plasmids, the detection limit of three viruses was 100copies/μl. Among 40 clinical specimens, 18 specimens were found positive, which was completely concordant with the conventional PCR method. CONCLUSIONS: The new developed Luminex x-TAG assay is an accurate, high throughput method for rapid detection of three important viruses of rabbits.","Wu, Miaoli; Zhu, Yujun; Cong, Feng; Rao, Dan; Yuan, Wen; Wang, Jing; Huang, Bihong; Lian, Yuexiao; Zhang, Yu; Huang, Ren; Guo, Pengju",BMC Vet Res,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-018-1438-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29625588/,597

The over-the-counter histamine-2 receptor antagonist famotidine is a putative therapy for COVID-19. We quantitively assessed longitudinal changes in patient reported outcome measures in non-hospitalised patients with COVID-19 who self-administered high-dose famotidine orally. DESIGN: Patients were enrolled consecutively after signing written informed consent. Data on demographics, COVID-19 diagnosis, famotidine use, drug-related side effects, temperature measurements, oxygen saturations and symptom scores were obtained using questionnaires and telephone interviews. Based on a National Institute of Health (NIH)-endorsed Protocol to research Patient Experience of COVID-19, we collected longitudinal severity scores of five symptoms (cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, headaches and anosmia) and general unwellness on a four-point ordinal scale modelled on performance status scoring. All data are reported at the patient level. Longitudinal combined normalised symptom scores were statistically compared. RESULTS: Ten consecutive patients with COVID-19 who self-administered high-dose oral famotidine were identified. The most frequently used famotidine regimen was 80 mg three times daily (n=6) for a median of 11 days (range: 5–21 days). Famotidine was well tolerated. All patients reported marked improvements of disease related symptoms after starting famotidine. The combined symptom score improved significantly within 24 hours of starting famotidine and peripheral oxygen saturation (n=2) and device recorded activity (n=1) increased. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this case series suggest that high-dose oral famotidine is well tolerated and associated with improved patient-reported outcomes in non-hospitalised patients with COVID-19.","Janowitz, Tobias; Gablenz, Eva; Pattinson, David; Wang, Timothy C; Conigliaro, Joseph; Tracey, Kevin; Tuveson, David",Gut,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32499303/; https://doi.org/10.1136/gutjnl-2020-321852,597

In an online survey conducted in the midst of COVID-19 pandemic with over 1000 Swedish participants we found that distrust in the government to cope with financial (but not healthcare) challenges of the pandemic was negatively related to the feeling of financial security. In a structural equation model, we also show that trust in government to deal with financial challenges of COVID-19 pandemic has a significant impact on general well-being through the mediating channel of financial well-being. In addition, trust in government to deal with healthcare challenges of COVID-19 pandemic has a significant direct impact on individuals’ general well-being. Our findings have important implications for public policy as they highlight the importance of citizens’ trust in well-functioning governmental institutions to help cope with not only healthcare, but also financial challenges of an ongoing pandemic.","Barrafrem, Kinga; Tinghög, Gustav; Västfjäll, Daniel",J Behav Exp Finance,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34545323/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214635021000587; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbef.2021.100514; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2214635021000587,597

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study examines pregnant women with COVID‐19 in the five Nordic countries. Pregnant women were included if they were admitted to hospital between 1 March and 30 June 2020 and had a positive SARS‐CoV‐2 PCR test ≤14 days prior to admission. Cause of admission was classified as obstetric or COVID‐19‐related. RESULTS: In the study areas, 214 pregnant women with a positive test were admitted to hospital, of which 56 women required hospital care due to COVID‐19. The risk of admission due to COVID‐19 was 0.4/1000 deliveries in Denmark, Finland and Norway, and 3.8/1000 deliveries in the Swedish regions. Women hospitalized because of COVID‐19 were more frequently obese (p < 0.001) and had a migrant background (p < 0.001) compared with the total population of women who delivered in 2018. Twelve women (21.4%) needed intensive care. Among the 56 women admitted due to COVID‐19, 48 women delivered 51 infants. Preterm delivery (n = 12, 25%, p < 0.001) and cesarean delivery (n = 21, 43.8%, p < 0.001) were more frequent in women with COVID‐19 compared with women who delivered in 2018. No maternal deaths, stillbirths or neonatal deaths were reported. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of admission due to COVID‐19 disease in pregnancy was low in the Nordic countries. A fifth of the women required intensive care and we observed higher rates of preterm and cesarean deliveries. National public health policies appear to have had an impact on the risk of admission due to severe COVID‐19 disease in pregnancy.

The objective of this study was to characterize and describe the clinical and epidemiologic features of all the hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in Rivers State Nigeria, from March to August 2020. METHODS: a prospective descriptive multi-center study of patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 RT PCR, who were hospitalised for treatment and self-isolation in four treatment centers in Rivers state, Nigeria. RESULTS: the mean age of all the patients was 39.21 ± 12.31 years, with a range of 2 to 77 years. The majority of patients were in the 31 to 40-year (33.0%), 41 to 50-year (23.1%) and 18-to 30-year (22.0%) age groups. The patient population included 474 (73.4%) males and 172 (26.6%) females, with 93 (14.4%) healthcare workers. A history of contact and travel was established in 38.5% and at least one comorbid disease condition was present in 32.8% of patients. Patients with severe disease were 61 (9.45%), while the overall case fatality rate was 2%. The leading comorbid disease conditions were Hypertension in 23.8% and diabetes in 7.7% of patients. Fever (26.0%), dry Cough (17.6%), dyspnoea (12.7%), anosmia (12.7%) and headache (9.9%) were the most common symptoms. The presence of comorbidity and increasing age predicted death from COVID-19.

Sin embargo, las formas graves en niños son poco frecuentes. Se presenta el caso de un lactante con síndrome inflamatorio multisistémico relacionado con COVID-19. CASO CLÍNICO Lactante de 8 meses que estuvo en contacto con adultos positivos para COVID-19. El lactante inició con una forma leve de la enfermedad que progresó con rapidez a una forma crítica de presentación inicialmente con estado epiléptico, y a su ingreso con evidencia de inflamación en laboratorios, afección sistémica grave con falla multiorgánica y prueba de reacción en cadena de la polimerasa para SARS-CoV-2 nasofaríngea positiva. El lactante falleció 7 días después de su ingreso. CONCLUSIONES El espectro de presentación de la COVID-19 en niños menores de 1 año es variable y aún no se cuentan con criterios consensuados para el diagnóstico y el tratamiento. Todo lactante con enfermedad grave con compromiso multiorgánico al ingreso en tiempos de pandemia obliga a realizar una meticulosa historia clínica y considerar la infección por SARS-CoV-2 hasta su confirmación. BACKGROUND COVID-19 has become a threat to global public health. However, severe forms of COVID-19 presentation in children are rare. We present the case of an infant with COVID 19-related multisystem inflammatory syndrome. CASE REPORT We describe the case of an 8-month-old infant who had contact with COVID-19 positive adults. The infant began with mild symptoms of the disease but rapidly progressed to a critical form of presentation:initially with epileptic status, and upon admission with laboratory evidence of inflammation, severe systemic condition with multiple organ failure, and a positive nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. The infant died 7 days after admission. CONCLUSIONS The spectrum of COVID-19 presentation in children under one year of age is variable, and there are still no established criteria for diagnosis and treatment.

(2011) Epidemiological and clinical features of respiratory viral infections in hospitalized children during the circulation of influenza virus A(H1N1) 2009. Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses 5(6), e528–e534. Background Seasonal influenza viruses and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are primary causes of acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) in children. New respiratory viruses including human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human bocavirus (hBoV), and influenza 2009 A(H1N1) virus have a strong impact on the pediatric population. Objectives To evaluate epidemiological and clinical features of ARTIs in hospitalized children. Methods From December 1, 2008, to December 31, 2009, all children under age fifteen (n = 575) hospitalized for ARTIs were investigated for influenza A (subtype H1N1, H3N2, and 2009 H1N1) and B, RSV A and B, hMPV, and hBoV by PCR. Results Fifty‐one percent of samples were positive for these respiratory viruses. The frequencies of virus detection were RSV 34·1%, hBoV 6·8%, hMPV 5%, seasonal influenza A 5%, and seasonal influenza B 0%. From April 2009, 11·6% of collected samples were influenza 2009 A(H1N1) positive. Respiratory syncytial virus activity peaked in January, hBoV in February, and hMPV in April. Seasonal influenza A was detected only between January and April 2009, while influenza 2009 A(H1N1) peaked in November. Respiratory syncytial virus and hMPV were mainly associated with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) and with necessity of O(2) administration. The 2009 pandemic influenza was more frequently detected in elder children (P < 0·001) and was associated with higher, longer‐lasting fevers compared with other viral infections (P < 0·05). Conclusions All considered viruses were involved in LRTIs. The primary clinical relevance of RSV and a similar involvement of both seasonal influenza and emerging viruses investigated were observed on the pediatric population.","Zuccotti, Gianvincenzo; Dilillo, Dario; Zappa, Alessandra; Galli, Erica; Amendola, Antonella; Martinelli, Marianna; Pariani, Elena; Salvini, Filippo; Tanzi, Elisabetta; Riva, Enrica; Giovannini, Marcello",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21668662/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-2659.2011.00264.x,597

Research question What is the incidence of VTE and bleeding among hospitalized patients with COVID-19? Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis we searched 15 standard and COVID-19 specific sources between January 1, 2020 and July 31, 2020, with no restriction by language. We pooled incidence estimates using random-effects meta-analyses. We evaluated heterogeneity using the I2 statistic. We assessed publication bias using Begg's and Egger's tests. Results The pooled incidence was 17.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 13.4%-20.9%) for VTE, 12.1% (95% CI, 8.4%-16.4%) for DVT, 7.1% (95% CI, 5.3%-9.1%) for PE, 7.8% (95% CI, 2.6%-15.3%) for bleeding, and 3.9% (95% CI, 1.2%-7.9%) for major bleeding. In subgroup meta-analyses, the incidence of VTE was higher when assessed by screening (33.1% vs. 9.8% by clinical diagnosis), among patients in the ICU (27.9% vs. 7.1% in the ward), in prospective studies (25.5% vs. 12.4% in retrospective studies), and with the inclusion of catheter-associated thrombosis/isolated distal DVTs and isolated subsegmental PEs. The highest pooled incidence estimate of bleeding was reported for patients receiving intermediate- or full-dose anticoagulation (21.4%) and the lowest in the only prospective study that assessed bleeding events (2.7%). Interpretation Among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the overall estimated pooled incidence of VTE was 17.0%, with higher rates with routine screening, inclusion of distal DVT and subsegmental PE, in critically ill patients, and in prospective studies. Bleeding events were observed in 7.8% of patients and were sensitive to use of escalated doses of anticoagulants, and nature of data collection.

In this investigation, we examined the association between psychological outcomes and various factors among German dentists. Dentists from all German federal states were invited to participate in this study through a self-administered online questionnaire between July and November 2020. This questionnaire collected information on demographics, Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21), and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) instrument. The associations displayed between demographic and psychological outcomes of depression, anxiety, stress, intrusion, avoidance, and hyperarousal were evaluated. Seven-hundred-and-thirty-two dentists participated in the survey and reported overall scores of (4.88 ± 4.85), (2.88 ± 3.57), (7.08 ± 5.04), (9.12 ± 8.44), (10.68 ± 8.88) and (10.35 ± 8.68) for depression, anxiety, stress, intrusion, avoidance, and hyperarousal, respectively.

However, the health risks posed by sedentary behaviors are not well known. The mean daily duration of sedentary behavior is 8.3 hours among the Korean population and 7.7 hours among the American adult population. Sedentary lifestyles are spreading worldwide because of a lack of available spaces for exercise, increased occupational sedentary behaviors such as office work, and the increased penetration of television and video devices. Consequently, the associated health problems are on the rise. A sedentary lifestyle affects the human body through various mechanisms. Sedentary behaviors reduce lipoprotein lipase activity, muscle glucose, protein transporter activities, impair lipid metabolism, and diminish carbohydrate metabolism. Furthermore, it decreases cardiac output and systemic blood flow while activating the sympathetic nervous system, ultimately reducing insulin sensitivity and vascular function. It also alters the insulin-like growth factor axis and the circulation levels of sex hormones, which elevates the incidence of hormone-related cancers. Increased sedentary time impairs the gravitostat, the body’s weight homeostat, and weight gain, adiposity, and elevated chronic inflammation caused by sedentary behavior are risk factors for cancer. Sedentary behaviors have wide-ranging adverse impacts on the human body including increased all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease mortality, cancer risk, and risks of metabolic disorders such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipidemia; musculoskeletal disorders such as arthralgia and osteoporosis; depression; and, cognitive impairment. Therefore, reducing sedentary behaviors and increasing physical activity are both important to promote public health.","Park, Jung Ha; Moon, Ji Hyun; Kim, Hyeon Ju; Kong, Mi Hee; Oh, Yun Hwan",Korean J Fam Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33242381/; https://doi.org/10.4082/kjfm.20.0165,597

OBJECTIVE: To describe the local spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Valencia, Spain. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This single-center epidemiological cohort study of patients with SARS-CoV-2 was performed at University General Hospital in Valencia (population in the hospital catchment area, 364 000), a tertiary hospital. The study included all consecutive patients with COVID-19 isolated at home from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic on February 19 until August 31, 2020. EXPOSURES: Cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by the presence of IgM antibodies or a positive polymerase chain reaction test result on a nasopharyngeal swab were included. Cases in which patients with negative laboratory results met diagnostic and clinical criteria were also included. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the characterization of dissemination patterns and connections among the 20 neighborhoods of Valencia during the outbreak. To recreate the transmission network, the inbound and outbound connections were studied for each region, and the relative risk of infection was estimated. RESULTS: In total, 2646 patients were included in the analysis. The mean (SD) age was 45.3 (22.5) years; 1203 (46%) were male and 1442 (54%) were female (data were missing for 1); and the overall mortality was 3.7%. The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 cases was higher in neighborhoods with higher household income (β(2) [for mean income per household] = 0.197; 95% CI, 0.057-0.351) and greater population density (β(1) [inhabitants per km(2)] = 0.228; 95% CI, 0.085-0.387). Correlations with meteorological variables were not statistically significant. Neighborhood 3, where the hospital and testing facility were located, had the most outbound connections (14). A large residential complex close to the city (neighborhood 20) had the fewest connections (0 outbound and 2 inbound). Five geographically unconnected neighborhoods were of strategic importance in disrupting the transmission network. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study of local dissemination of SARS-COV-2 revealed nonevident transmission patterns between geographically unconnected areas. The results suggest that tailor-made containment measures could reduce transmission and that hospitals, including testing facilities, play a crucial role in disease transmission. Consequently, the local dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 spread might inform the strategic lockdown of specific neighborhoods to stop the contagion and avoid a citywide lockdown.","Romero García, Carolina; Iftimi, Adina; Briz-Redón, Álvaro; Zanin, Massimiliano; Otero, Maria; Ballester, Mayte; de Andrés, José; Landoni, Giovanni; de las Marinas, Dolores; Catalá Bauset, Juan Carlos; Mandingorra, Jesus; Conca, José; Correcher, Juan; Ferrer, Carolina; Lozano, Manuel",JAMA Netw Open,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.13818; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34143191/,597

683496,Just the Facts: What are the roles of oxygen escalation and noninvasive ventilation in COVID-19?,2020-05-13,"Different viral agents, such as herpesviruses, human papillomavirus, and Coxsackie virus, are responsible for primary oral lesions, while other viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus, affect the oral cavity due to immune system weakness. Interestingly, it has been reported that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients can show cutaneous manifestations, including the oral cavity. However, the association between oral injuries and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is still unclear. This narrative review aimed to summarize the available literature and provide an overview of oral lesions associated with COVID-19. An online literature search was conducted to select relevant studies published up to November 2020. The results of 17 studies showed variability in oral lesions associated with COVID-19, including ulcerations, aphthous-like lesions, and macules. The tongue, lips, and palate were the most frequent anatomical locations. According to current knowledge, the etiopathogenesis of multiple COVID-19-associated lesions seems to be multifactorial. The appearance of such lesions could be related to the direct or indirect action of SARS-CoV-2 over the oral mucosa cells, coinfections, immunity impairment, and adverse drug reactions. Nevertheless, COVID-19-associated oral lesions may be underreported, mainly due to lockdown periods and the lack of mandatory dispositive protection. Consequently, further research is necessary to determine the diagnostic and pathological significance of oral manifestations of COVID-19. All medical doctors, dentists, and dermatologists are encouraged to perform an accurate and thorough oral examination of all suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases to recognize the disease's possible early manifestations.","La Rosa, Giusy Rita Maria; Libra, Massimo; De Pasquale, Rocco; Ferlito, Sebastiano; Pedullà, Eugenio",Front Med (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33521007/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2020.571214,597

Identification of high-risk cases will enable appropriate intervention and escalation. This study investigates the routine laboratory tests and cytokines implicated in COVID-19 for their potential application as biomarkers of disease severity, respiratory failure and need of higher-level care. From analysis of 203 samples, CRP, IL-6, IL-10 and LDH were most strongly correlated with the WHO ordinal scale of illness severity, the fraction of inspired oxygen delivery, radiological evidence of ARDS and level of respiratory support (p[≤]0.001). IL-6 levels of >3.27pg/ml provide a sensitivity of 0.87 and specificity of 0.64 for a requirement of ventilation, and a CRP of >37mg/L of 0.91 and 0.66.

Methods: To assess TNF-antagonist therapy, 18 hospitalized adults with hypoxic respiratory failure and COVID-19 pneumonia received single-dose infliximab-abda therapy 5mg/kg intravenously between April and December 2020. The primary endpoint was time to increase in oxygen saturation to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (SpO2/FiO2) by >50 compared to baseline and sustained for 48 hours. Secondary endpoints included 28-day mortality, dynamic cytokine profiles (Human Cytokine 48-Plex Discovery Assay, Eve Technologies), secondary infections, duration of supplemental oxygen support and hospitalization. Findings: Patients were predominantly in critical respiratory failure (15/18, 83%), male (14/18, 78%), above 60 years (median 63 yrs, range 31-80), race-ethnic minorities (13/18, 72%), lymphopenic (13/18, 72%), steroid-treated (17/18, 94%), with a median ferritin of 1953ng/ml. Sixteen patients (89%) met the primary endpoint within a median of 4 days, 15/18 (83%) recovered from respiratory failure, and 14/18 (78%) were discharged in a median of 8 days and were alive at 28-day follow-up. Deaths among three patients > 65yrs age with pre-existing lung disease or multiple comorbidities were attributed to secondary lung infection. Mean plasma IP-10 levels declined sharply from 9183 pg/ml to 483 pg/ml at Day 3 and further to 146 pg/ml at Day 14/discharge. Significant declines in IFN-{gamma}, TNF, IL-27, CRP and ferritin were specifically observed at Day 3 whereas other cytokines were unmodified. IL-6 levels declined sharply among patients with baseline levels >10 pg/ml. Among 13 lymphopenic patients, six (46%) had resolution of lymphopenia by day 3, and 11 by day 14. CXCR3-ligand (IP-10 and CXCL-9) declines were strongly correlated among patients with lymphopenia reversal (Day 3, Pearson r: 0.98, p-value: 0.0006). Interpretation: Consistent with a pathophysiological role of TNF, the clinical and cytokine data indicate that infliximab-abda may rapidly abrogate pathological inflammatory signaling to facilitate clinical recovery in severe and critical COVID-19.

This disparity may reflect different airway levels of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, ACE2, and the spike protein activator, TMPRSS2. Here we explore the role of genetics and co-expression networks in regulating these genes in the airway, through the analysis of nasal airway transcriptome data from 695 children. We identify expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) for both ACE2 and TMPRSS2, that vary in frequency across world populations. Importantly, we find TMPRSS2 is part of a mucus secretory network, highly upregulated by T2 inflammation through the action of interleukin-13, and that interferon response to respiratory viruses highly upregulates ACE2 expression. Finally, we define airway responses to coronavirus infections in children, finding that these infections upregulate IL6 while also stimulating a more pronounced cytotoxic immune response relative to other respiratory viruses.

The close association of coronavirus replication with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) results in the ER stress responses, which impose a challenge to the viruses. Viruses, in turn, have come up with various mechanisms to block or subvert these responses. One of the ER stress responses is inhibition of the global protein synthesis to reduce the amount of unfolded proteins inside the ER lumen. Viruses have evolved the capacity to overcome the protein translation shutoff to ensure viral protein production. Here, we review the strategies exploited by coronavirus to modulate cellular stress response pathways. The involvement of coronavirus-induced stress responses and translational control in viral pathogenesis will also be briefly discussed.","Fung, To Sing; Liao, Ying; Liu, Ding Xiang",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v8070184; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27384577/,597

Accordingly, integrins have been proposed as host receptors for SARS-CoV-2. The hypothesis was supported by sequence and structural analysis. However, given that the microenvironment of the RGD motif imposes structural hindrance to the protein-protein association, the validity of this hypothesis is still uncertain. Here, we used normal mode analysis, accelerated molecular dynamics microscale simulation, and protein-protein docking to investigate the putative role of RGD motif of SARS-CoV-2 RBD for interacting with integrins. We found, by molecular dynamics, that neither RGD motif nore its microenvironment show any significant conformational shift in the RBD structure. Highly populated clusters were used to run a protein-protein docking against three RGD-binding integrin types, showing no capability of the RBD domain to interact with the RGD binding site. Moreover, the free energy landscape revealed that the RGD conformation within RBD could not acquire an optimal geometry to allow the interaction with integrins. Our results highlighted different structural features of the RGD motif that may prevent its involvement in the interaction with integrins. We, therefore, suggest, in the case where integrins are confirmed to be the direct host receptors for SARS-CoV-2, a possible involvement of other residues to stabilize the interaction.","Othman, Houcemeddine; Messaoud, Haifa Ben; Khamessi, Oussema; Mabrouk, Hazem Ben; Ghedira, Kais; Bharuthram, Avani; Treurnicht, Florette; Achilonu, Ikechukwu; Sayed, Yasien; Srairi-Abid, Najet",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.24.445335,597

Published guidelines point out that low dose and short duration systemic glucocorticoid therapy may be considered for patients with rapidly progressing COVID-19 while the evidence is still limited. Methods: We comprehensively searched electronic databases and supplemented the screening by conducting a manual search. We included RCTs and cohort studies evaluating the effectiveness and safety of glucocorticoids in children and adults with COVID-19, SARS and MERS, and conducted meta-analyses of the main indicators that were identified in the studies. Results: Our search retrieved 23 studies, including one RCT and 22 cohort studies, with a total of 13,815 patients. In adults with COVID-19, the use of systemic glucocorticoid did not reduce mortality (RR=2.00, 95% CI: 0.69 to 5.75, I 2=90.9%) or the duration of lung inflammation (WMD=-1 days, 95% CI: -2.91 to 0.91), while a significant reduction was found in the duration of fever (WMD=-3.23 days, 95% CI: -3.56 to -2.90). In patients with SARS, glucocorticoids also did not reduce the mortality (RR=1.52, 95% CI: 0.89 to 2.60, I2=84.6%), duration of fever (WMD=0.82 days, 95% CI: -2.88 to 4.52, I2=97.9%) or duration of lung inflammation absorption (WMD=0.95 days, 95% CI: -7.57 to 9.48, I2=94.6%). The use of systemic glucocorticoid therapy prolonged the duration of hospital stay in all patients (COVID-19, SARS and MERS). Conclusions: Glucocorticoid therapy was found to reduce the duration of fever, but not mortality, duration of hospitalization or lung inflammation absorption. Long-term use of high-dose glucocorticoids increased the risk of adverse reactions such as coinfections, so routine use of systemic glucocorticoids for patients with COVID-19 cannot be recommend.

The chest CT of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated for Pneumonia Severity Score (PSS) as the ratio of the volume of involved lung parenchyma to the total lung volume. In addition, BMD was manually measured from the vertebral corpus using axial CT images. The relationships of clinical variables, PSS and vertebral BMD with patient outcomes, namely mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mechanical ventilation were investigated. Lower BMD was defined as ≤100 HU. The study included 209 patients (118 males, 56.4%). As a result of the univariate analysis, the rates of mortality, ICU admission and mechanical ventilation were 17.2% (n = 36), 24.8% (n = 52), and 20.6% (n = 43), respectively, and they were significantly higher among the patients with lower BMD (38.1 vs 13.0%, p < 0.001; 33.4 vs 21.2%, p = 0.002; and 38.1 vs 8.2%, p < 0.001, respectively). In the mortality group, PSS was significantly higher (median, 9 vs 5; p < 0.001) and vertebral BMD was significantly lower (median, 83 vs 139; p < 0.001). Severe clinical incidence was significantly higher in patients with lower BMD compared to those with higher BMD (39.7 vs 24.7% and p = 0.028). There was a significant correlation between clinical classification and lower BMD (r = 0.152 and p = 0.028). The multivariate analysis revealed vertebral BMD [odds ratio (OR), 1.028; 95% CI, 1.011−1.045, p = 0.001) and lower BMD (OR, 4.682; 95% CI, 1.784−12.287, p = 0.002) as significant independent predictors of mortality.

Recent studies have revealed that several nonstructural proteins encoded by the PRRSV genome independently antagonize the type 1 IFN system. The present study sought to identify the structural proteins that possess the immune evasion properties in immortalized porcine alveolar macrophages (PAM). Each structural protein gene was stably expressed in a porcine monocyte-derived macrophage cell line, PAM-pCD163, and tested for its potential to inhibit IFN-β induction. We then focused on the nucleocapsid (N) protein, which has a strong inhibitory effect on dsRNA-induced IFN-β production. Upon dsRNA stimulation, IFN-β production was shown to decrease proportionally with increasing levels of N expression. Furthermore, the PRRSV N protein was found to down-regulate IFN-dependent gene production by dsRNA. Taken together, these results indicate the ability of N to modulate the dsRNA-mediated IFN induction pathways. In addition, the N protein significantly interfered with dsRNA-induced phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF3. Our data suggest that the PRRSV N protein is a responsible component, independent of other nonstructural elements, for evading the IFN response by antagonizing IRF3 activation.","Sagong, Mingeun; Lee, Changhee",Arch Virol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-011-1116-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21947566/,597

Under Section 904(a)(3) of the US Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, tobacco manufacturing companies need to report on quantities of harmful and potentially harmful constituents (HPHCs) in all tobacco products. While the extensive HPHC list of 2012 includes 93 chemicals, which are categorized as carcinogenic, respiratory, cardiovascular, or reproductive toxicants or addictive compounds, it fails to include microorganisms (bacteria and fungi) that have been shown to contribute to adverse health outcomes among tobacco users. Nevertheless, over the last 50 years, researchers have studied microorganisms in a variety of tobacco products using both culture-based and culture-independent techniques. In this mini-review, we provide an overview of this body of research, detailing the bacterial and fungal microbiomes residing in commercial tobacco products. Overall, studies have characterized over 89 unique bacterial genera and 19 fungal genera in cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos, hookah, and smokeless tobacco. The most predominant bacterial genera are Bacillus, Pseudomonas, and Staphylococcus. Fungal genera identified have included Aspergillus, Penicillium, Mucor, Alternaria, Cladosporium, Streptomyces, and Candida, to name a few. While some of the identified microorganisms are known human pathogens, others are potential opportunistic pathogens. Given the vast array of microorganisms that are present across diverse types of tobacco products, future research should be focused on the viability of these microorganisms, as well as their ability to transfer to the user’s respiratory tract, potentially contributing to adverse health outcomes. KEY POINTS: • Commercial tobacco products harbor diverse bacterial and fungal communities. • Some of these microorganisms are known or opportunistic human pathogens. • Research on their viability and transmission to users’ respiratory tracts is needed.","Chattopadhyay, Suhana; Malayil, Leena; Mongodin, Emmanuel F.; Sapkota, Amy R.",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-021-11183-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33704513/,597

However, in the setting of hemodynamically-stable pulmonary embolism, the diagnostic role of echocardiography is still the subject of debate. In light of its high specificity and low sensitivity, some authors suggest that echocardiographic signs of right ventricle overload could be used to rule-in pulmonary embolism. In this study, we aimed to clarify the diagnostic role of echocardiographic signs of right ventricle overload in the setting of hemodynamically-stable pulmonary embolism in the ED. Materials and Methods: we performed a systematic review of literature in PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane databases, considering the echocardiographic signs for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in the ED. Studies considering unstable or shocked patients were excluded. Papers enrolling hemodynamically stable subjects were selected. We performed a diagnostic test accuracy meta-analysis for each sign, and then performed a critical evaluation according to pretest probability, assessed with Wells’ score for pulmonary embolism. Results: 10 studies were finally included. We observed a good specificity and a low sensitivity of each echocardiographic sign of right ventricle overload. However, once stratified by the Wells’ score, the post-test probability only increased among high-risk patients. Conclusions: signs of echocardiographic right ventricle overload should not be used to modify the clinical behavior in low- and intermediate- risk patients according to Wells’ score classification. Among high-risk patients, however, echocardiographic signs could help a physician in detecting patients with the highest probability of pulmonary embolism, necessitating a confirmation by computed tomography with pulmonary angiography. However, a focused cardiac and thoracic ultrasound investigation is useful for the differential diagnosis of dyspnea and chest pain in the ED.","Falsetti, Lorenzo; Zaccone, Vincenzo; Marra, Alberto M.; Tarquinio, Nicola; Viticchi, Giovanna; Sampaolesi, Mattia; Riccomi, Francesca; Giovenali, Laura; Ferrini, Consuelo; Moroncini, Gianluca; Nitti, Cinzia; Salvi, Aldo",Medicina (Kaunas),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34440972/; https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina57080766,597
688189,"COVID-19, variants of concern and pregnancy outcome",2021-08-03,"The COVID-19 pandemic forced us, as health care professionals and members of the general public, to adapt. Simple things we take for granted have become more difficult. As pressures increased for health care professionals, conversations and decisions have become tougher. This brought the need to adapt working practices and find ways to continue providing compassionate patient-centred care remotely. In UK radiotherapy departments, radiation therapist (review radiographer)-led clinics moved to telephone-based clinics to reduce the time spent by patients in a hospital environment. This required setting up a ""virtual"" clinic room with patients by removing distractions and setting boundaries for the conversation. We have had to adapt our communication skills quickly as picking up on nonverbal cues is not possible through the phone. It can be challenging to understand feelings through the tone of a patient's voice and empathise accordingly. The pandemic has forced patients to slow down and really focus on themselves which has led to picking up physical and mental health changes earlier. This is one of the many positive outcomes that can be drawn from the pandemic. Although we have changed how we work, ultimately we are still here to help our patients.","Julka-Anderson, Naman",J Med Imaging Radiat Sci,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1939865420301533; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1939865420301533?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmir.2020.06.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32709543/,597
688221,Endocrinology in the time of COVID-19,2020-04-17,"In the absence of a vaccine, social distancing behaviour is pivotal to mitigate COVID-19 virus spread. In this large-scale behavioural experiment, we gathered data during Smart Distance Lab: The Art Fair (n = 839) between August 28 and 30, 2020 in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. We varied walking directions (bidirectional, unidirectional, and no directions) and supplementary interventions (face mask and buzzer to alert visitors of 1.5 metres distance). We captured visitors’ movements using cameras, registered their contacts (defined as within 1.5 metres) using wearable sensors, and assessed their attitudes toward COVID-19 as well as their experience during the event using questionnaires. We also registered environmental measures (e.g., humidity). In this paper, we describe this unprecedented, multi-modal experimental data set on social distancing, including psychological, behavioural, and environmental measures. The data set is available on figshare and in a MySQL database. It can be used to gain insight into (attitudes toward) behavioural interventions promoting social distancing, to calibrate pedestrian models, and to inform new studies on behavioural interventions.","Tanis, Charlotte C.; Leach, Nina M.; Geiger, Sandra J.; Nauta, Floor H.; Dablander, Fabian; van Harreveld, Frenk; de Wit, Sanne; Kanters, Gerard; Knoppers, Jop; Markus, Diederik A.

Our previous study showed that the CD8(+) T-cell epitope aa129–aa137 (FVVPILLKA, FA9) of the Hantaan virus (HTNV) nucleoprotein (NP), restricted by human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A*02, induced specific CD8(+) T-cell responses that controlled HTNV infection in humans. However, the in vivo immunogenicity of peptide FA9 and the effect of FA9-specific CD8(+) T-cell immunity remain unclear. Here, based on a detailed structural analysis of the peptide FA9/HLA-A*0201 complex and functional investigations using HLA-A2.1/K(b) transgenic (Tg) mice, we found that the overall structure of the peptide FA9/HLA-A*0201 complex displayed a typical MHC class I fold with Val2 and Ala9 as primary anchor residues and Val3 and Leu7 as secondary anchor residues that allow peptide FA9 to bind tightly with an HLA-A*0201 molecule. Residues in the middle portion of peptide FA9 extruding out of the binding groove may be the sites that allow for recognition by T-cell receptors. Immunization with peptide FA9 in HLA-A2.1/K(b) Tg mice induced FA9-specific cytotoxic T-cell responses characterized by the induction of high expression levels of interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α, granzyme B, and CD107a. In an HTNV challenge trial, significant reductions in the levels of both the antigens and the HTNV RNA loads were observed in the liver, spleen, and kidneys of Tg mice pre-vaccinated with peptide FA9. Thus, our findings highlight the ability of HTNV epitope-specific CD8(+) T-cell immunity to control HTNV and support the possibility that the HTNV-NP FA9 peptide, naturally processed in vivo in an HLA-A*02-restriction manner, may be a good candidate for the development HTNV peptide vaccines.","Ma, Ying; Cheng, Linfeng; Yuan, Bin; Zhang, Yusi; Zhang, Chunmei; Zhang, Yun; Tang, Kang; Zhuang, Ran; Chen, Lihua; Yang, Kun; Zhang, Fanglin; Jin, Boquan",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2016.00298; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27551282/,597
688401,Spontaneous Intraparenchymal Hepatic Hemorrhage as a Sequela of COVID-19,2020-09-14,"INTRODUCTION: health care data accuracy feeds the development of sound healthcare policy and the prioritisation of interventions in scarce resource environments. We designed a retrospective study at the sole paediatric government hospital in Sierra Leone to examine mortality statistics, specifically: the accuracy of mortality data collected in 2017; and the quality of cause of death (CoD) reporting for 2017. METHODS: the retrospective audit included all available mortality statistics collected at the hospital during the 2017 calendar year. For the purpose of calculating a mortality rate, admission data was additionally gathered. Four different hospital entities were identified that collected mortality data (the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) office; the nurse ledgers; the office of births and deaths; and the mortuary). Data from each hospital entity were used for the comparative analysis. RESULTS: striking differences were found in the rate of hospital mortality reported by different entities. The M&E office (responsible for providing data to the ministry of health and sanitation) reported a hospital mortality rate of 2.94% in 2017. Mortuary and nursing admissions records showed a hospital mortality rate of 18.7%. Discrepancies and issues of quality in CoD reporting between hospital entities were identified. CONCLUSION: significant variations were found in the generation of official hospital mortality data. Mortality data informs health service prioritisation, resource distribution, outcome measures and epidemiological surveillance. Resources to support quality improvement initiatives are needed in the creation of an in-hospital system that reports accurate data with a process for real-time institutional data feedback.","Ragab, Hany; Mclellan, Andrew; Bell, Nellie; Mustapha, Ayeshatu",Pan Afr Med J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33796170/; https://doi.org/10.11604/pamj.2020.37.356.23607,597

After protein precipitation of plasma samples with acetonitrile, chromatographic separation was performed at ambient temperature using a Waters XBridge® Phenyl 3.5 μm (2.1 × 50 mm) column. The mobile phases consisted of water-methanol (9:1, v/v) with 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate as phase A and methanol-water (9:1, v/v) with 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate as phase B. Gradient elution was applied at a flow rate of 400 μL/min. Analytes were detected and quantified using multiple reaction monitoring in electrospray ionization positive mode. Stable isotopically labeled compounds of each kinase inhibitor were used as internal standards. The acquisition time was 7.0 min per run. All analytes and internal standards eluted within 3.0 min. The calibration curves were linear over the range of 2–500 ng/mL for afatinib, axitinib, bosutinib, lenvatinib, ruxolitinib, and trametinib, and 6–1500 ng/mL for cabozantinib, dabrafenib, nilotinib, and osimertinib (coefficients of correlation ≥ 0.99). Validation assays for accuracy and precision, matrix effect, recovery, carryover, and stability were appropriate according to regulatory agencies. The rapid and sensitive assay ensures high throughput and was successfully applied to monitor concentrations of kinase inhibitors in patients.

The closing of borders, the reduction of people transit and the confinement of the population has affected the supply chains of these life-saving medical products. The aim of this mini-review is to focus on how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected CAR T-cell therapy and taking into consideration the differences between the large-scale centralized productions for the pharmaceutical industry versus product manufacturing in the academic/hospital environment. We also review different aspects of CAR T-cell therapy and our managerial experience of patient selection, resource prioritization and some practical aspects to consider for safe administration. Although hospitals have been forced to change their usual workflows to cope with the saturation of health services by hospitalized patients, we recommend centers to continue offering this potentially curative treatment for patients with relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancies. Consequently, we propose appropriate selection criteria, early intervention to attenuate neurotoxicity or cytokine release syndrome with tocilizumab and prophylactic/preventive strategies to prevent infection. These considerations may apply to other emerging adoptive cell treatments and the corresponding manufacturing processes.","Ortiz de Landazuri, Iñaki; Egri, Natalia; Muñoz-Sánchez, Guillermo; Ortiz-Maldonado, Valentín; Bolaño, Victor; Guijarro, Carla; Pascal, Mariona; Juan, Manel",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.573179; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33178200/,597

The peptide also inhibits proliferation of coronavirus NL63. On human cells both viruses utilize angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as entry receptor. Blocking the viral entry is specific as alpha virus Sindbis shows no reduction in infectivity. Peptide (438)YKYRYL(443) is part of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV. Peptide libraries were screened by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to identify RBD binding epitopes. (438)YKYRYL(443) carries the dominant binding epitope and binds to ACE2 with K(D) = 46 μM. The binding mode was further characterized by saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamic simulations.

690050,Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19): Implications for Cardiovascular and Socially At-risk Populations,2020-05-06,"INTRODUCTION: The WHO declared a global pandemic on 11 March 2020. Since then, the world has been firmly in the grip of the COVID-19. To date, more than 211 730 035 million confirmed cases and more than 4 430 697 million people have died. While controlling the virus and implementing vaccines are the main priorities, the population mental health impacts of the pandemic are expected to be longer term and are less obvious than the physical health ones. Lockdown restrictions, physical distancing, social isolation, as well as the loss of a loved one, working in a frontline capacity and loss of economic security may have negative effects on and increase the mental health challenges in populations around the world. There is a major demand for long-term research examining the mental health experiences and needs of people in order to design adequate policies and interventions for sustained action to respond to individual and population mental health needs both during and after the pandemic. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This repeated cross-sectional mixed-method study conducts regular self-administered representative surveys, and targeted focus groups and semi-structured interviews with adults in the UK, as well as validation of gathered evidence through citizens’ juries for contextualisation (for the UK as a whole and for its four devolved nations) to ensure that emerging mental health problems are identified early on and are properly understood, and that appropriate policies and interventions are developed and implemented across the UK and within devolved contexts. STATA and NVIVO will be used to carry out quantitative and qualitative analysis, respectively. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval for this study has been granted by the Cambridge Psychology Research Ethics Committee of the University of Cambridge, UK (PRE 2020.050) and by the Health and Life Sciences Research Ethics Committee of De Montfort University, UK (REF 422991). While unlikely, participants completing the self-administered surveys or participating in the virtual focus groups, semi-structured interviews and citizens’ juries might experience distress triggered by questions or conversations. However, appropriate mitigating measures have been adopted and signposting to services and helplines will be available at all times. Furthermore, a dedicated member of staff will also be at hand to debrief following participation in the research and personalised thank-you notes will be sent to everyone taking part in the qualitative research. Study findings will be disseminated in scientific journals, at research conferences, local research symposia and seminars. Evidence-based open access briefings, articles and reports will be available on our study website for everyone to access. Rapid policy briefings targeting issues emerging from the data will also be disseminated to inform policy and practice. These briefings will position the findings within UK public policy and devolved nations policy and socioeconomic contexts in order to develop specific, timely policy recommendations. Additional dissemination will be done through traditional and social media. Our data will be contextualised in view of existing policies, and changes over time as-and-when policies change.","Van Bortel, Tine; John, Ann; Solomon, Susan; Lombardo, Chiara; Crepaz-Keay, David; McDaid, Shari; Yap, Jade; Weeks, Lauren; Martin, Steven; Guo, Lijia; Seymour, Catherine; Thorpe, Lucy; Morton, Alexander D; Davidson, Gavin; Kousoulis, Antonis A",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-046422; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34452957/,597
