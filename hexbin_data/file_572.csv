In fact, health policy-makers could manage the problem of the regional spread of an epidemic, by organizing many vaccination campaigns, or by suggesting other defensive strategies such as blocking movement of people coming from borders of regions at high-risk of infection and entering very controlled regions or with insignificant infection rate. Further, we introduce in the discrete SIR systems, two control variables which represent the effectiveness rates of vaccination and travel-blocking operation. We focus in our study to control the outbreaks of an epidemic that affects a hypothetical population belonging to a specific region. Firstly, we analyze the epidemic model when the control strategy is based on the vaccination control only, and secondly, when the travel-blocking control is added. The multi-points boundary value problems, associated to the optimal control problems studied here, are obtained based on a discrete version of Pontryagin’s maximum principle, and resolved numerically using a progressive-regressive discrete scheme that converges following an appropriate test related to the Forward-Backward Sweep Method on optimal control.","Zakary, Omar; Rachik, Mostafa; Elmouki, Ilias",Int J Dyn Control,572,16

The disease has acquired endemic proportions in tropical countries where the hygienic conditions are not satisfactory while the environmental conditions favor the proliferation of parasite and its transmission, particularly through the female anopheles. It is obvious that to square up the problems, there is a need for designing and development of more effective drugs, which can combat the drug-resistant strains of the parasite. Molecular biology of the parasite and its homing into host cellular tropics provide multiple drug targets that could judiciously be considered for engineering and designing of new generation antimalarial drugs and also drug delivery systems. Though the recent reports document that against malaria parasite the vaccine could be developed, nevertheless, due to smart mutational change overs by the parasite, it is able to bypass the immune surveillance. The developed vaccine therefore failed to assure absolute protection against the malarial infection. In the conventional mode of treatment antimalarial drugs, the dose and dosage regimen that is followed at large crops up the contraindicative manifestations, and hence compromising the effective treatment. The emerging trends and new updates in contemporary biological sciences, material sciences, and drug delivery domain have enabled us with the availability of a multitude of mode and modules which could plunge upon the nanotechnology in particular to treat this challenging infection. The nanotechnology-based option may be tuned or customized as per the requirements to mark and target i.e. the infected RBCs, for targeted drug delivery.

We investigated if an alternative approach, based on an event-triggered averaging (ETA) process, is more effective at preserving the actual ventilation waveform. Ten paralyzed patients undergoing volume-controlled ventilation were studied; 30 breaths for each patient were identified to compare LPF and ETA. For ETA the identified breaths were temporally aligned on the beginning of inspiration; the values of the thirty curves at each time point were averaged. The analysis was conducted on the global EIT signal and on four ventral-to-dorsal regions of interest. Global tidal variations by ETA resulted higher than LPF (average difference 139 ± 88 arbitrary units, p = 0.004). Both for global and regional waveforms, minimum and maximum EIT slopes were steeper by ETA as compared to LPF (average difference respectively − 57 ± 60 mL/s and 144 ± 96 mL/s for global signal, p < 0.05); ventilator inspiratory peak airflow correlated with maximum slope measured by ETA (r = 0.902, p < 0.001), but not LPF (p = 0.319). Beginning of inspiration identified on the ventilator waveform and on the global EIT signal by ETA occurred simultaneously, (+ 0.04 ± 0.07 s, p = 0.081), while occurred earlier by LPF (− 0.26 ± 0.1 s, p < 0.001). Removal of cardiac related impedance changes by ETA results in a ventilation signal more similar to the waveforms recorded by the ventilator, particularly regarding the slope of impedance changes and time at the minimum values as compared to LPF.

The mild, enzymatic degradation of this sustainable lignocellulosic biomass affords ca. 0.10–0.13 g/g (dry weight) of d-glucose quantifiable voltammetrically in real time, over a two hundred-fold range in experimental laboratory scales (25 mL to 5.0 L), with pressure disc refining of the wheat straw enabling almost twice the amount of d-glucose to be generated during the hydrolysis stage than experiments using atmospheric refining (0.06–0.09 g/g dry weight). Fermentation of the resulting hydrolysate affords 0.08–0.10 g/g (dry weight) of ethanol over similar scales, with ethanol productivity at ca. 37 mg/(L h). These results demonstrate that minimal cellulose decomposition occurs during pressure refining of wheat straw, in contrast to hemicellulose, and suggest that the development of green, mechanochemical processes for the scalable and cost-effective manufacture of second-generation bioethanol requires improved cellulose decomposition.","Ward, Rhys A.; Charlton, Adam; Welham, Kevin J.; Baker, Paul; Zein, Sharif H.; Tomkinson, Jeremy; Richards, David I.; Kelly, Stephen M.; Lawrence, Nathan S.; Wadhawan, Jay D.",Electrochem commun,572,1

In framing land subsidence as a classic ‘wicked’ policy problem, and also as a hybrid geological and anthropogenic phenomenon that is unevenly experienced across urban contexts, the paper uses a three-step analysis. First, satellite-derived InSAR maps are integrated with Sentinel-1A data in order to reveal the socio-temporal variability of subsidence rates which in turn pose challenges in uniformly applying regulatory action. Second, a multi-sectoral mapping of diverse policies and practices spanning urban water supply, groundwater extraction, land use zoning, building codes, tenurial security, and land reclamation reveal the extent to which the broader coastal governance landscape remains fragmented and incongruous, particularly in arresting a multi-dimensional phenomenon such as subsidence. Finally, in reference to distinct coastal identities of each city–the ‘Sinking Capital’ (Jakarta), ‘Fortress Singapore’, and the ‘Disaster Capital’ (Manila) the paper illustrates how land subsidence is portrayed across the three metropolises in markedly similar ways: as a reversible, quasi-natural, and/or a highly individualized problem.","Siriwardane-de Zoysa, Rapti; Schöne, Tilo; Herbeck, Johannes; Illigner, Julia; Haghighi, Mahmud; Simarmata, Hendricus; Porio, Emma; Rovere, Alessio; Hornidge, Anna-Katharina",PLoS One,572,1

Nurses form the largest group in health care that uses electronic health records (EHRs) and their mobile versions. Mobile devices are suggested to promote nurses’ workflow, constant updating of patient information, and improve the communication within the health care team. However, little is known about their effect on nurses’ well-being. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the association between using a mobile version of the EHR and nurses’ perceived time pressure, stress related to information systems, and self-rated stress. Moreover, we examined whether mobile device use modifies the associations of EHR usability (ease of use and technical quality), experience in using EHRs, and number of systems in daily use with these well-being indicators. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional population-based survey study among 3610 Finnish registered nurses gathered in 2020. The aforesaid associations were examined using analyses of covariance and logistic regression adjusted for age, gender, and employment sector (hospital, primary care, social service, and other). RESULTS: Nurses who used the mobile version of their EHR had higher levels of time pressure (F(1,3537)=14.96, P<.001) and stress related to information systems (F(1,3537)=6.11, P=.01), compared with those who did not use mobile versions. Moreover, the interactions of mobile device use with experience in using EHRs (F(1,3581)=14.93, P<.001), ease of use (F(1,3577)=10.16, P=.001), and technical quality (F(1,3577)=6.45, P=.01) were significant for stress related to information systems. Inexperience in using EHRs, low levels of ease of use, and technical quality were associated with higher stress related to information systems and this association was more pronounced among those who used mobile devices. That is, the highest levels of stress related to information systems were perceived among those who used mobile devices as well as among inexperienced EHR users or those who perceived usability problems in their EHRs. CONCLUSIONS: According to our results, it seems that at present mobile device use is not beneficial for the nurses’ well-being. In addition, mobile device use seems to intensify the negative effects of usability issues related to EHRs. In particular, inexperienced users of EHRs seem to be at a disadvantage when using mobile devices. Thus, we suggest that EHRs and their mobile versions should be improved such that they would be easier to use and would better support the nurses’ workflow (eg, improvements to problems related to small display, user interface, and data entry). Moreover, additional training on EHRs, their mobile versions, and workflow related to these should be provided to nurses.","Heponiemi, Tarja; Kaihlanen, Anu-Marja; Gluschkoff, Kia; Saranto, Kaija; Nissinen, Sari; Laukka, Elina; Vehko, Tuulikki",JMIR Med Inform,572,22

Angiogenesis is the process that controls the growth of blood vessels within tissues while angiogenesis proteins play a significant role in the proper working of this process. The balancing of these signals is necessary for the proper working of angiogenesis. Unbalancing of these signals increases blood vessel formation, which causes abnormal growth or several diseases including cancer. The proposed work focuses on developing a two-layered prediction model using different classifiers like random forest (RF), neural network, and support vector machine. The first level performs in silico identification of angiogenesis proteins based on the primary structure. In the case the protein is an angiogenesis protein, then the second level predicts whether the protein is linked with tumor angiogenesis or not. The performance of the model is evaluated through various validation techniques. The model was evaluated using k-fold cross-validation, independent, self-consistency, and jackknife testing. The overall accuracy using an RF classifier for angiogenesis at the first level was 97.8% and for tumor angiogenesis at the second level was 99.5%, ANN showed 94.1% accuracy for angiogenesis and 79.9% for tumor angiogenesis, and the accuracy of SVM for angiogenesis was 78.8% and for tumor angiogenesis was 65.19%.","Allehaibi, Khalid; Daanial Khan, Yaser; Khan, Sher Afzal",Appl Bionics Biomech,572,1

These ROS originate from activated neutrophils in infections and in immune and autoimmune reactions, from tissue deposits of ferritin, and from futile cycling of cytochrome P450 (CYP) following exposure to persistent chemicals, and may be perpetuated by the actions of complement, cytokines and eicosanoids. Acute inflammation is normally arrested by removal of ROS by tissue glutathione (GSH) and the antioxidant vitamins, A, C and E, all of which are regenerated by NADH and NADPH. Failure of this antioxidant defence system can lead to oxidative stress and to chronic inflammatory disease, including surgical shock and MSOF. The roles of oxidative stress and microcirculatory arrest in promoting MSOF, and of GSH, the antioxidant defence system, and fibronectin in preventing this, are reviewed in the light of recent experimental studies of surgical shock, including fasting, anaesthesia, hepatic ischaemia and reperfusion.","Parke, A.; Parke, D.

It has been postulated that patients with allergic rhinitis experience more pronounced symptoms and pathophysiology during URI than individuals without allergy. These observations have provided limited insight into the pathogenesis of URI in allergic patients. To better define these relationships several groups of investigators have examined the effect of experimental virus infection on volunteers with and without allergic rhinitis and with and without asthma. Lemanski et al. showed that Rhinovirus 16 (RV16) was able to modify bronchial hyperreactivity and late phase allergic asthmatic reactions. Calhoun et al. demonstrated that RV16 potentiated airway inflammation after segmental allergen bronchoprovocation in allergic subjects. Experimental RV16 infection also provoked a modest increase in histamine responsiveness accompanied by a modest increase in bronchial and intranasal lymphocytes and eosinophils. Yet, experimental RV16 infection did not trigger asthma or changes in spirometry or changes in bronchial reactivity to histamine or bradykinin in normal subjects. Studies in our laboratories using experimental Rhinovirus 39 (RV39) infection did not alter pulmonary measurements or methacholine responses in normal healthy allergic subjects. These results were surprising, as enhanced WBC histamine release was observed in the same RV39‐infected allergic subjects and was similar to that observed in RV16 infection described by others. The RV39‐infected allergic subjects also showed acute increases in serum IgE as well as changes of cellular immune parameters. Bardin et al. described more severe nasal symptoms as well as increased nasal albumin in allergic rhinitis subjects experimentally infected with RV16. However, allergic subjects infected with RV39 did not show a physiologic hyper‐responsiveness during a nonallergy season. Analysis of nasal secretions during RV39 infection did show more vascular permeability in allergic subjects. Experimental infection with RV39 and Influenza A has provoked eustachian tube obstruction, otitis media and rarely acute otitis. These studies of volunteers experimentally infected with virus suggest that atopy alone does not predispose to more severe symptoms but combining URI with allergen exposure enhanced allergen‐induced inflammation. Recent studies implicate cytokines as participants in these virus‐provoked responses. Increases in nasal lavage concentrations of IL‐6 were found during experimental URIs caused by RV39, Influenza A and respiratory syncytial virus and coincide with peaks in symptomatology and pathophysiology. Moreover, IL‐6 applied directly to the nasal mucosa in noninfected allergic subjects reproduced symptoms of rhinitis. Other studies have shown that IL‐10 secretion from peripheral blood white cells was impaired in allergic subjects after experimental infection with Influenza A. It is anticipated that future studies using natural infection as well as experimental virus infection model will further define the mechanisms and relationships of virus infection to allergy and asthma.","Fireman, P.",,572,1

As the National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of the Zhejiang University School of Medicine is the primary medical care center for COVID-19 in Zhejiang Province. Based on the present expert consensus carried out by the National Health Commission and National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, our team summarized and established an effective treatment strategy centered on “Four-Anti and Two-Balance” for clinical practice. The “Four-Anti and Two-Balance” strategy includes antivirus, anti-shock, anti-hypoxemia, and anti-secondary infection, and maintaining of water, electrolyte and acid/base balance and microecological balance. Simultaneously, an integrated multidisciplinary personalized treatment is recommended to improve therapeutic effects. The importance of early viral detection, dynamic monitoring of inflammatory indexes, and chest radiographs has been emphasized in clinical decision-making. Sputum was observed with the highest positive rate by RT-PCR. Viral nucleic acids could be detected in 10% of the patients’ blood samples at the acute phase and 50% of patients had positive RT-PCR results in their feces. We also isolated live viral strains from feces, indicating potential infectiousness of feces. Dynamic cytokine detection was necessary to timely identify cytokine storms and for the application of the artificial liver blood purification system. The “Four-Anti and Two-Balance” strategy effectively increased cure rates and reduced mortality. Early antiviral treatment alleviated disease severity and prevented illness progression. We found that lopinavir/ritonavir combined with abidol showed antiviral effects against COVID-19. Shock and hypoxemia were usually caused by cytokine storms. The artificial liver blood purification system was able to rapidly remove inflammatory mediators and block the cytokine storm. Moreover, it also contributed to the balance of fluids, electrolytes, and acids/bases and thus improved treatment efficacy during critical illness. For cases of severe illness, early and also short periods of moderate glucocorticoid administration was supported. Patients with an oxygenation index below 200 mm Hg were transferred to the intensive care unit. Conservative oxygen therapy was preferred and noninvasive ventilation (NIV) was not recommended. Patients with mechanical ventilation were strictly supervised with cluster ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention strategies. Antimicrobial prophylaxis was prescribed rationally and was not recommended, except for patients with a long course of disease, repeated fever, and elevated procalcitonin, similarly secondary fungal infections were of concern. Some patients with COVID-19 showed intestinal microbial dysbiosis with decreased genus such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. Nutritional and gastrointestinal function should; therefore, be assessed for all patients. Nutritional support and application of prebiotics or probiotics were suggested to regulate the balance of intestinal microbiota and reduce the risk of secondary infections due to bacterial translocation. Anxiety and fear were common in patients with COVID-19. Therefore, we established a dynamic assessment and warning for psychological crises. We also integrated Chinese medicine in the treatment to promote rehabilitation. We optimized nursing processes for severe patients to promote their rehabilitation. Since viral clearance patterns after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections remained unclear, 2 weeks quarantine for discharged patients was required, and a regular following-up was also needed. These Zhejiang experiences and suggestions have been implemented in our center and achieved good results. However, since COVID-19 was a newly emerging disease, more work is warranted to further improve strategies of prevention, diagnosis, and treatment for COVID-19.","Xu, Kaijin; Cai, Hongliu; Shen, Yihong; Ni, Qin; Chen, Yu; Hu, Shaohua; Li, Jianping; Wang, Huafen; Yu, Liang; Huang, He; Qiu, Yunqing; Wei, Guoqing; Fang, Qiang; Zhou, Jianying; Sheng, Jifang; Liang, Tingbo; Li, Lanjuan",,572,4

Toxoplasmosis is asymptomatic in healthy individuals, whereas it may lead to death in immune suppressed or deficient patients. A vaccine against T. gondii is required to prevent consequences of the infection. The aim of this study is to generate a multivalent recombinant protein vaccine against T. gondii. METHODS: 49 previously discovered antigenic proteins of T gondii were evaluated by their expression level in E. coli and by comprehensive bioinformatics analyses to determine antigenic epitopes. Based on these analyses, six vaccine candidate proteins were selected to generate a hexavalent recombinant protein vaccine adjuvanted with Montanide ISA 50 V. Humoral and cellular immune responses were determined by flow cytometry and ELISA. Vaccinated mice were challenged with T. gondii Ankara strain tachyzoites. RESULTS: In mice vaccinated with hexavalent vaccine, strong total IgG (P < 0.0001) and IgG2a (P < 0.001) responses were induced compared to controls, the ratio of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes secreting IFN-γ increased, and significantly higher extracellular IFN-γ secretion was achieved compared to the controls (P < 0.001). The survival time of the vaccinated mice increased to 8.38 ± 2.13 days which was significantly higher than controls (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, these results show that the hexavalent vaccine which is developed for the first time against T. gondii induced strong and balanced Th1 and Th2 immune responses as well as conferred significant protection against challenge with lethal toxoplasmosis in murine model.","Şahar, Esra Atalay; Can, Hüseyin; İz, Sultan Gülçe; Döşkaya, Aysu Değirmenci; Kalantari-Dehaghi, Mina; Deveci, Remziye; Gürüz, Adnan Yüksel; Döşkaya, Mert",BMC Infect Dis,572,16

Given an initial policy (i.e. statistical model) trained off-line, our method uses this policy to guide its search and gradually improves it by leveraging feedback obtained from a deductive reasoning engine. Specifically, we formulate program synthesis as a reinforcement learning problem and propose a new variant of the policy gradient algorithm that can incorporate feedback from a deduction engine into the underlying statistical model. The benefit of this approach is two-fold: First, it combines the power of deductive and statistical reasoning in a unified framework. Second, it leverages deduction not only to prune the search space but also to guide search. We have implemented the proposed approach in a tool called Concord and experimentally evaluate it on synthesis tasks studied in prior work. Our comparison against several baselines and two existing synthesis tools shows the advantages of our proposed approach. In particular, Concord solves 15% more benchmarks compared to Neo, a state-of-the-art synthesis tool, while improving synthesis time by 8.71[Formula: see text] on benchmarks that can be solved by both tools.","Chen, Yanju; Wang, Chenglong; Bastani, Osbert; Dillig, Isil; Feng, Yu",Computer Aided Verification,572,1

Although some models have been developed to predict linear or conformational B-cell epitopes, their performance is still unsatisfactory. Hundreds of thousands of linear B-cell epitope data have accumulated in the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB). These data can be explored using the deep learning methods, in order to create better predictive models for linear B-cell epitopes. RESULTS: After data cleaning, we obtained 240,563 peptide samples with experimental evidence from the IEDB database, including 25,884 linear B-cell epitopes and 214,679 non-epitopes. Based on the peptide center, we adapted each peptide to the same length by trimming or extending. A random portion of the data, with the same amount of epitopes and non-epitopes, were set aside as test dataset. Then a same number of epitopes and non-epitopes were randomly selected from the remaining data to build a classifier with the feedforward deep neural network. We built eleven classifiers to form an ensemble prediction model. The model will report a peptide as an epitope if it was classified as epitope by all eleven classifiers. Then we used the test data set to evaluate the performance of the model using the area value under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) as an indicator. We established 40 models to predict linear B-cell epitopes of length from 11 to 50 separately, and found that the AUC value increased with the length and tended to be stable when the length was 38. Repeated results showed that the models constructed by this method were robust. Tested on our and two public test datasets, our models outperformed current major models available. CONCLUSIONS: We applied the feedforward deep neural network to the large amount of linear B-cell epitope data with experimental evidence in the IEDB database, and constructed ensemble prediction models with better performance than the current major models available. We named the models as DLBEpitope and provided web services using the models at http://ccb1.bmi.ac.cn:81/dlbepitope/.","Liu, Tao; Shi, Kaiwen; Li, Wuju",BioData Min,572,1

Pulmonary vein isolation is a well-established option for symptomatic atrial fibrillation and for atrial fibrillation concomitant with heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. Recently, pulmonary vein isolation using cryoballoon showed non-inferiority to radiofrequency ablation with respect to the treatment of patients with drug-refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. However, the effectiveness of acute-phase rhythm control by semi-urgent pulmonary vein isolation using cryoballoon in patients with haemodynamically unstable atrial fibrillation storm accompanied with low cardiac output syndrome is unclear. Herein, we present a case in which semi-urgent pulmonary vein isolation using cryoballoon was effective for acute-phase rhythm control against drug-resistant and haemodynamically unstable repetitive atrial fibrillation tachycardia accompanied with low cardiac output syndrome. CASE PRESENTATION: A 57-year-old man was hospitalised for New York Heart Association functional class 4 heart failure with atrial fibrillation tachycardia and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction of 20% accompanied with low cardiac output syndrome-induced liver damage. The haemodynamics collapsed during atrial fibrillation tachycardia, which had become resistant to intravenous amiodarone and repeated electrical cardioversions. In addition to atrial fibrillation, atrial tachycardia and common-type atrial flutter appeared on day 3. Multiple organ failure progressed gradually due to haemodynamically unstable atrial fibrillation tachycardia storm accompanied with low cardiac output syndrome. On day 4, to focus on treatment of heart failure and multiple organ failure, semi-urgent rescue pulmonary vein isolation using cryoballoon to atrial fibrillation and cavotricuspid isthmus ablation to common-type atrial flutter were performed for acute-phase rhythm control. Soon after the ablation procedure, atrial fibrillation and common-type atrial flutter were lessened, and sinus rhythm was restored. A stable haemodynamics was successfully achieved with the improvement of hepatorenal function. The patient was discharged on day 77 without complications. CONCLUSIONS: This case demonstrates that acute-phase rhythm control by semi-urgent pulmonary vein isolation using cryoballoon could be a treatment option in patients with haemodynamically unstable atrial fibrillation tachycardia storm accompanied with low cardiac output syndrome, which is refractory to cardioversion and drug therapy.","Koike, Toshiharu; Mori, Fumiaki; Maeda, Ryozo; Kobayashi, Ken; Sakai, Masayuki; Oyabu, Kenjiro; Matsui, Yuko; Yoshikawa, Masafumi; Sugiyama, Kou; Ajiro, Yoichi; Iwade, Kazunori",BMC Cardiovasc Disord,572,22

With shipping being responsible for 80% of global trade, the article addresses issues relating to the response of the maritime industry, governments and international organizations to the pandemic. It also addresses the impact of the pandemic on the world’s almost 2 million seafarers who as key workers enable global trade. The article examines the serious challenges seafarers have faced relating to quarantine requirements, restrictions on border crossings with border closures, repatriation and crew changeovers, abandonment, renewals of certificates and licencing of seafarers, resupply and ship surveys. The article includes the response of governments and that of United Nations agencies and in particular the World Health Organization, the International Maritime Organization, the International Labour Organization and the International Civil Aviation Organization. The significant role played by the maritime industry in providing substantive guidance is commended. The article concludes that COVID-19 will continue to have a huge impact on the maritime industry and on world trade for the foreseeable future. The expectation is that the industry will hopefully emerge stronger and become more robust to enable world trade to be efficient and sustainable. It is also expected that the pandemic will enable a greater recognition of the world’s seafarers who facilitate world trade, while ensuring a better future for humanity.","Doumbia-Henry, Cleopatra",WMU J Marit Affairs,572,1

These developments in international and US trade policy, including Washington’s launch of a full-fledged trade war against China in March 2018, have converged disastrously with the outbreak of the novel coronavirus in November 2019 and the onset of a worldwide pandemic. Given the status of the USA as the world’s hegemon since 1945, what is new here is the effort of the Trump administration to abdicate US leadership, jettison longstanding alliances, and turn back the clock on the country’s close integration with the world economy. Already, greatly reduced flows of goods, services, and people have translated into radically reduced global growth, widespread business disruptions, and high unemployment. Remarkably, the White House has refused to recognize the severity of the pandemic and has undermined the precautions of the US science community. We argue that these multiple shocks constitute a major critical juncture on par with what the world community faced in 1945. However, in the twenty-first century we have seen that high levels of economic uncertainty and political instability have superseded the long-held notion that international interdependence would pull the world community through tough times such as these. Could the triple whammy of a destructive trade war, deadly pandemic, and secular decline of US leadership trigger a new generation of policy innovation and institution building on par with the post-1945 era? In terms of the global trade regime, it would be difficult to imagine a buoyant recovery of the world economy in the absence of a serious reckoning with the pattern of norm erosion that we identify here.","Albertoni, Nicolás; Wise, Carol",Fudan J,572,1

This includes the current approach for engineering genomes of large dsDNA viruses. However, for poxviruses we show that Cas9-guide RNA complexes cut viral genomes soon after their entry into cells, but repair of these breaks is inefficient. As a result, Cas9 targeting makes only modest, if any, improvements to basal rates of homologous recombination between repair constructs and poxvirus genomes. Instead, Cas9 cleavage leads to inhibition of poxvirus DNA replication thereby suppressing virus spread in culture. This unexpected outcome allows Cas9 to be used as a powerful tool for selecting conventionally generated poxvirus recombinants, which are otherwise impossible to separate from a large background of parental virus without the use of marker genes. This application of CRISPR/Cas9 greatly speeds up the generation of poxvirus-based vaccines, making this platform considerably more attractive in the context of personalised cancer vaccines and emerging disease outbreaks.","Gowripalan, Anjali; Smith, Stewart; Stefanovic, Tijana; Tscharke, David C.",Commun Biol,572,16

However, little is known about the characteristics of transmission networks of people who inject drugs (PWID). METHODS: Sequencing of a segment of the HCV genome was performed on samples collected from a community-based cohort of PWID between August 2005 and December 2016. Phylogenetic trees were inferred, and clusters were identified (70% bootstrap threshold; 0.04 maximum genetic distance threshold). We describe sex, race, age difference, and HIV infection status of potential transmission partners. Logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with being in an HCV cluster. RESULTS: Of 508 HCV genotype 1 viremic PWID, 8% (n = 41) were grouped into 20 clusters, consisting of 19 pairs and 1 triad. In adjusted analyses, female sex (odds ratio [OR] 2.3 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2–4.5]) and HIV infection (OR 5.7 [CI 2.7–11.9]) remained independently associated with being in an HCV infection cluster. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular epidemiological analysis reveals that, in this cohort of PWID in Baltimore, HIV infection and female sex were associated with HCV clustering. Combination HCV prevention interventions targeting HIV infected PWID and addressing HCV infection prevention needs of women have potential to advance HCV elimination efforts.

As a result, supply chains tend to be operated without much concern for their broader contextual environment. This perspective overlooks that supply chains have become both vulnerable and harmful systems. Recent and ongoing crises have emphasized that the structures and processes of supply chains are fluid and interwoven with political‐economic and planetary phenomena. Building on panarchy theory, this article reinterprets the supply chain as a social–ecological system and leaves behind a modernist view of SCM, replacing it with a more contemporary vision of “dancing the supply chain.” A panarchy is a structure of adaptive cycles that are linked across different levels on scales of time, space, and meaning.

Its effect in patients with moderate COVID-19 remains unclear. METHODS: We conducted an open-label, phase 3 trial (NCT04252664) involving hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, evidence of pulmonary infiltrates, and oxygen saturation >94% on room air. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to receive up to 5d or 10d of RDV with standard of care (SoC), or SoC alone; patients could be discharged prior to completing per-protocol assigned treatment duration. RDV was dosed intravenously at 200 mg on d1, 100 mg daily thereafter. Patients were evaluated daily while hospitalized, and via telephone if discharged. The primary endpoint was clinical status on d11 assessed on a 7-point ordinal scale. Results regarding the primary endpoint are expected to be published before IDWeek 2020; we plan to present d28 results at the meeting. RESULTS: In total, 584 patients underwent randomization and started their assigned treatment (191, 5d RDV; 193, 10d RDV; 200, SoC). By d11, ³ 2 point improvement on the ordinal scale occurred in 70% of patients in the 5d arm, 65% in the 10d arm, and 61% in the SoC arm. Patients in the 5d RDV arm were significantly more likely to have an improvement in clinical status than those receiving SoC (odds ratio [OR], 1.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09–2.48; P=0.017); OR of improvement for the 10d RDV arm compared to SoC was 1.31 (95% CI, 0.88–1.95]; p=0.183). This improvement in the 5-day arm over the SOC arm was noted from d6 through d11. We observed a peak of discharges corresponding with the assigned treatment duration of RDV, with increased discharges at d6 in the 5-day arm and at d11 in the 10-day arm. A worsening of clinical status of ≥ 1 point in the ordinal scale was observed more commonly in the SoC am (n=19, 10%) versus the 5d RDV (n=7, 4%) and 10d RDV (n=9, 5%). CONCLUSION: RDV for up to 5 days was superior to SoC in improving the clinical status of patients with moderate COVID-19 by d11. We will report d28 outcomes at the meeting. DISCLOSURES: Francisco M.

However, especially in healthcare systems with limited resources, costly PET/CT images are often not readily available. Conventional machine learning models either process CT or PET/CT images but not both. Models designed for PET/CT images are hence restricted by the number of PET images, such that they are unable to additionally leverage CT-only data. In this work, we apply the concept of visual soft attention to efficiently learn a model for lung cancer segmentation from only a small fraction of PET/CT scans and a larger pool of CT-only scans. We show that our model is capable of jointly processing PET/CT as well as CT-only images, which performs on par with the respective baselines whether or not PET images are available at test time. We then demonstrate that the model learns efficiently from only a few PET/CT scans in a setting where mostly CT-only data is available, unlike conventional models.

50139,50139,50139,The role of miRNAs in COVID-19 disease,16.590853,6.2721066,2021-03-24,"Background: In recent years, the therapeutics for eye diseases as retinopathy diabetic, dry eye, glaucoma and contact lenses fabrication are including nanocompounds as ocular drug delivery systems, biomarkers for detection of eye diseases, copper and silver ions that has been incorporated by means of the nanotechnology for the production of less toxic and more effective alternatives. Several compounds such as silver nanoparticles, turmeric-based nanocomposites, neovascularization blockers and nanoparticles extracted from the plant Costus pictus among others have been researched for this purpose. Those compounds are some of the promising research efforts that are studying and will contribute to preventing vitreous hemorrhages and ocular manifestations that affect large populations, being one of the main causes of blindness in the world. Although, nanotechnology has a lot of contributions which are advantageous for several medicinal areas. Objective: To carry out a bibliographic review of the latest advances and clinical or toxics findings in nanotechnology for the therapeutic treatment for visual health. Method: The review was undertaken in the next databases: Google Scholar, Science Direct, Scopus, Elsevier, Springer and PubMed using the keywords: nanotechnology in diabetic retinopathy, nanotechnology and visual health. 75 papers were reviewed with the keywords “nanotechnology”, “visual health”, “diabetic retinopathy”, “glaucoma” and “dry eye”. The Boolean Connector used was “and”. Results: The advantage of nanotechnology at the ocular level is that it allows in the treatment and pharmacology to create nanocomposites that allow them to pass through the delicate ocular tissues and reach the posterior segment of the eye, where many traditional drugs fail. The first nanocomposites were the anti-neovascularization agents such as bevacizumab, atorvastatin, and recently they are producing longer release compounds based on nanotechnology as curcumin silver nanoparticles, extract of insulin Plant (Costus pictus) leaves and its silver nanoparticle are some of those nano compounds that promise to be an alternative way to treat diabetic retinopathy. Conclusion: Many nanotechnology-based drugs have been obtained from plant extracts although they are used in treatment applications at the systemic level, recently some have begun to be used at the ocular level in nanocomposite presentations. Nanotechnology is an alternative to the control of diabetic retinopathy, which affects a large part of the population. The use of drug delivery systems based on nanoparticles as liposomes, dendrimers, cationic nanoemulsions, polymeric nanoparticles pointing out the advantages of the proposed nanomedicines to target this ocular disease.","Durán, Patricia; Villegas, Andrea; Campos, Gusdanis",Nanotechnology for Advances in Medical Microbiology,572,16

We analysed our success in addressing this. METHOD: A key factor was the proximity of a private hospital (GN) to the primary trust. GN acted as a ‘clean site’. From 6th April 2020, two robots and dedicated staff were relocated to day surgery theatres with direct access to GN. Procedures and post-operative recovery happened in GN. National surgical guidelines were followed related to Covid-19. All theatre staff were swabbed weekly. Patients were risk stratified prior to admittance. RESULTS: We reviewed operations performed and cancer pathway data from March to June 2020 and compared it to data collected from August to November 2019. From March until June 2020 we performed 369 cancer operations; 120 robotic, 138 endoscopic and 7 open cases. From August to November 2019 we performed 407 cancer operations; 116 robotic, 175 endoscopic and 7 open cases. No elective patient developed symptomatic COVID-19 secondary to admission. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that with rapid development of separate ‘clean’ and ‘COVID’ sites, we successfully delivered a comparable, safe and effective cancer service. As we potentially face a second wave we share our success to see if these changes can be replicated elsewhere.","Dirie, J; Hart, E; Mahesan, T; Fawcett, W; Perry, M; Janardanan, S; Moschonas, D; Krishnaji, P; Chedid, W A",Br J Surg,572,16

The law changes have been criticized for reducing equity, benefiting wealthier business owners at the expense of individuals in the long term (while also increasing the deficit) adding to complexity, and creating incentives for shifting profits and activities offshore. These critiques give rise to the question of how best, and under what criteria, to evaluate the changes to the international tax system brought about by the US tax reform. This paper analyzes the tax law changes adopted in the TCJA that impact cross-border investment within the context of several decades of policy proposals that recognized the flaws and deficiencies of the prior system and attempted to develop proposals that balanced creating incentives for the efficient use of capital and the benefits of US investment overseas while minimizing incentives for profit shifting. Reviewing the various provisions of the law in the context of a series of reform proposals made over the previous decade shows the extent to which most of the international law changes introduced by the TCJA closely followed these well-developed ideas. And yet, there appears to be a disconnect between the goals of the law change and the extent to which the laws as enacted have effectuated that change. The divergence provides a cautionary tale for public finance economists wishing to engage in international tax regime change.","Herzfeld, Mindy",Int Tax Public Financ,572,6

Some evidence for disease progression exists, but there are few systematic analyses. Here, we evaluate alternating hemiplegia of childhood progression in humans and in the D801N knock-in alternating hemiplegia of childhood mouse, Mashlool, model. This study performed an ambidirectional (prospective and retrospective data) analysis of an alternating hemiplegia of childhood patient cohort (n = 42, age 10.24 ± 1.48 years) seen at one US centre. To investigate potential disease progression, we used linear mixed effects models incorporating early and subsequent visits, and Wilcoxon Signed Rank test comparing first and last visits. Potential early-life clinical predictors were determined via multivariable regression. We also compared EEG background at first encounter and at last follow-up. We then performed a retrospective confirmation study on a multicentre cohort of alternating hemiplegia of childhood patients from France (n = 52). To investigate disease progression in the Mashlool mouse, we performed behavioural testing on a cohort of Mashlool(-) mice at prepubescent and adult ages (n = 11). Results: US patients, over time, demonstrated mild worsening of non-paroxysmal disability index scores, but not of paroxysmal disability index scores. Increasing age was a predictor of worse scores: P < 0.0001 for the non-paroxysmal disability index, intellectual disability scale and gross motor scores. Earliest non-paroxysmal disability index score was a predictor of last visit non-paroxysmal disability index score (P = 0.022), and earliest intellectual disability score was a predictor of last intellectual disability score (P = 0.035). More patients with EEG background slowing were noted at last follow-up as compared to initial (P = 0.015). Similar worsening of disease with age was also noted in the French cohort: age was a significant predictor of non-paroxysmal disability index score (P = 0.001) and first and last non-paroxysmal disability index score scores significantly differed (P = 0.002). In animal studies, adult Mashlool mice had, as compared to younger Mashlool mice, (i) worse balance beam performance; (ii) wider base of support; (iii) higher severity of seizures and resultant mortality; and (iv) no increased predisposition to hemiplegic or dystonic spells. In conclusion, (i) non-paroxysmal alternating hemiplegia of childhood manifestations show, on average over time, progression associated with severity of early-life non-paroxysmal disability and age. (ii) Progression also occurs in Mashlool mice, confirming that ATP1A3 disease can lead to age-related worsening. (iii) Clinical findings provide a basis for counselling patients and for designing therapeutic trials. Animal findings confirm a mouse model for investigation of underlying mechanisms of disease progression, and are also consistent with known mechanisms of ATP1A3-related neurodegeneration.","Uchitel, Julie; Wallace, Keri; Tran, Linh; Abrahamsen, Tavis; Hunanyan, Arsen; Prange, Lyndsey; Jasien, Joan; Caligiuri, Laura; Pratt, Milton; Rikard, Blaire; Fons, Carmen; De Grandis, Elisa; Vezyroglou, Aikaterini; Heinzen, Erin L; Goldstein, David B; Vavassori, Rosaria; Papadopoulou, Maria T; Cocco, Isabella; Moré, Rebecca; Arzimanoglou, Alexis; Panagiotakaki, Eleni; Mikati, Mohamad A",Brain Commun,572,1

Census data reveal that the percentage of those who identify as Catholic is in steady decline, while the proportion of those with no religion continues to rise. Christian religious practice in Ireland is also decreasing, especially among young people. Catholic schools, once the dominant provider of second level education, are now in a minority. This changing landscape has influenced Religious Education in second level schools. It is now an optional subject, and the historic tradition of denominational, confessional Religious Education has given way to an approach designed to be inclusive of students of all faith and none. Yet the surrounding discourse is unsupported by the perspectives of Religious Education teachers. This study attempts to address this knowledge gap by investigating their views and experiences, particularly with regard to inclusion. Results indicate that teachers are concerned about ‘religious students’. Whereas new to the Irish context, this reflects international research which suggests that in a rapidly secularising society, those who continue to practise any faith, especially the once-majority faith, are vulnerable. Findings signpost evidence of this, with RE teachers most concerned about the bullying of Catholic students and least concerned about the bullying of atheists.","Meehan, Amalee; Laffan, Derek A.",j,572,1

While air temperature is reported to be associated with the BRCA occurrence, it is unclear whether daily minimum temperatures or the difference between maximum and minimum air temperatures influences BRCA occurrence the most. A retrospective cohort study of adult patients was conducted between January 2015 and February 2020 at Hirosaki University Hospital Emergency Department. The following data were collected: age, sex, day of cardiac arrest event, location of the event, initial cardiac rhythm, presence of return of spontaneous circulation, and overall mortality (status at 1 month after cardiac arrest event). Based on the day of the event and the location in which the event occurred, daily minimum and maximum temperatures were obtained from the Japan Meteorological Agency database. A total of 215 eligible cardiac arrest cases were identified, including 25 cases of BRCA. Comparing BRCA and non-BRCA, initial shockable cardiac rhythm (4.0% vs 44.7%), presence of return of spontaneous circulation (8.0% vs 34.7%), and overall mortality (96.0% vs 71.6%) differed significantly (P < .05 each). Daily minimum and maximum temperatures showed no significant relationships with BRCA or non-BRCA. Daily minimum temperature was a risk factor of BRCA occurrence after adjusting for age and temperature difference (risk ratio, 0.937; 95% confidence interval, 0.882–0.995). Daily minimum temperature represents a potential risk factor for BRCA occurrence.","Hiraki, Katsushige; Irie, Jin; Nomura, Osamu; Machino, Hiromi; Yaguchi, Shinya; Ishizawa, Yoshiya; Soma, Yuki; Hanada, Hiroyuki",Medicine (Baltimore),572,2

In this study, the authors investigated serum 25(OH)D and cortisol as moderators of the testosterone relationship with exercise performance in adolescent male athletes. METHODS A total of 88 ice hockey players were assessed for serum 25(OH)D, cortisol, testosterone, body composition, and exercise performance, based on countermovement jump power and muscle torque. The authors tested independent relationships, before examining complex interactions via moderated regression analyses. RESULTS Most athletes (62.5%) exhibited a suboptimal (20-30 ng·mL-1) serum 25(OH)D concentration, whereas 9.1% of athletes were deficient (<20 ng·mL-1). Serum 25(OH)D was not related to performance when controlling for testing year, age, and fat mass. Further modeling revealed a significant hormonal interaction. Specifically, in low-25(OH)D subjects, testosterone predicted countermovement jump power at a high (β = 7.10, effect size = .43, P < .01), but not low (β = -3.32, effect size = -.20, P = .09), cortisol concentration. CONCLUSIONS Serum 25(OH)D was a poor predictor of exercise performance, but it did moderate (with cortisol) the testosterone link to muscle power. Notably, this relationship emerged among individuals with a 25(OH)D concentration (∼22 ng·mL-1) approaching the deficiency cutoff. Viewing 25(OH)D as a moderating, rather than dose responsive, variable could help explain equivocal cross-sectional associations.","Crewther, Blair; Cook, Christian; Fitzgerald, John; Starczewski, Michal; Gorski, Michal; Orysiak, Joanna",Pediatric exercise science,572,0

During these unprecedented and challenging times, one institution's Department of Surgery put in place several important initiatives for promoting the well-being of trainees as they were redeployed to provide care to COVID-19 patients. In this article, the authors describe these initiatives, which fall into 3 broad categories: redeploying faculty and trainees, ensuring provider safety, and promoting trainee wellness.The redeployment initiatives are the following: reframing the team mindset, creating a culture of grace and forgiveness, establishing a multidisciplinary wellness committee, promoting centralized leadership, providing clear communication, coordinating between departments and programs, implementing phased restructuring of the department's services, establishing scheduling flexibility and redundancy, adhering to training regulations, designating a trainee ombudsperson, assessing physical health risks for high-risk individuals, and planning for structured deimplementation.Initiatives specific to promoting provider safety are appointing a trainee safety advocate, guaranteeing personal protective equipment and relevant information about these materials, providing guidance regarding safe practices at home, and offering alternative housing options when necessary.Finally, the initiatives put in place to directly promote trainee wellness are establishing an environment of psychological safety, providing mental health resources, maintaining the educational missions, solidifying a sense of community by showing appreciation, being attentive to childcare, and using social media to promote community morale.The initiatives to carry out the department's strategy presented in this article, which were well received by both faculty and trainee members of the authors' community, may be employed in other departments and even outside the context of COVID-19. The authors hope that colleagues at other institutions and departments, independent of specialty, will find the initiatives described here helpful during, and perhaps after, the pandemic as they develop their own institution-specific strategies to promote trainee wellness.","Kemp, Michael T; Rivard, Samantha J; Anderson, Sara; Audu, Christopher O; Barrett, Meredith; Fry, Brian T; Lane, Megan; Vu, Joceline V; Young, Bree Ann C; Englesbe, Michael; Sandhu, Gurjit; Coleman, Dawn M",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,572,16

A gastrointestinal linear stapler is used to taper the bowel sequentially. We report preliminary experience with tissue fusion technology to perform STEP in a porcine model. METHODS Four weaned male pigs (mean age, 4 ± 0 weeks; mean weight, 6.8 ± 0.1 kg) first underwent a 60-cm reversed intestinal segment followed by a STEP 4 to 6 weeks later. The LigaSure Impact (Covidien, Valleylab, Tyco Healthcare Group LP, Boulder, CO) was used to perform the procedure. Animals were fed on postoperative day 2 and terminated 1 week later. Morphometric data were collected, and intestinal tissue was obtained for histology. RESULTS Mean bowel caliber of 5.1 ± 0.5 cm was tapered to 1.8 ± 0.3 cm post-STEP with a mean increase in the length of the dilated segment of 82% ± 20%. All animals tolerated enteral feeding, and all survived to termination on day 7. Histologic evaluation revealed the zone of tissue fusion to be 7.1 ± 1.5 mm. Masson trichrome, hematoxylin and eosin, and polarized picrosirius red stains demonstrated that the fusion zone was well healed with overlying granulation tissue. CONCLUSION This is the first report of the successful application of radiofrequency energy to perform the STEP procedure in animals. Although further evaluation is required, tissue fusion devices may eventually provide an alternative to the linear stapler for the STEP procedure.","Suri, Megha; Dicken, Bryan; Nation, Patrick N; Wizzard, Pamela; Turner, Justine M; Wales, Paul W",Journal of pediatric surgery,572,20

This study is the first to characterize the long-term clinical and patient-reported outcomes of these components to better inform patients about the postreconstruction period. METHODS A retrospective review of medical records and phone-based survey of adult patients who underwent free flap reconstruction of the heel/ankle with 6-month minimum clinical follow-up was performed. RESULTS Forty-three patients, with 31 (72.1%) NWB and 12 (27.9%) WB defects, treated from January 1, 2000 to February 28, 2017 were included. Muscle flaps were more common than fasciocutaneous flaps (N = 36 [83.7%] vs. 7 [16.3%]). Flap survival rate was 95.3% and limb salvage rate was 93.0% at median follow-up of 12.0 months (interquartile range [IQR] 6.2, 25.5). Flap ulceration occurred more frequently in the WB region (41.7 vs. 6.5%, p = .0123). The survey response rate was 63.6%. The majority of patients complete daily tasks with no/little impairment (76.2%), walk half a mile or more (85.7%), returned to work (86.6%), and fit shoes ""fair"" or ""well"" (71.4%). Most patients were ""very satisfied"" with heel/ankle function (71.4%) and would ""very likely"" undergo the same procedure if needed (76.2%). CONCLUSIONS Free flap reconstruction in both the NWB Achilles tendon and WB heel pad has excellent limb salvage and flap survival rates. Patients were satisfied with heel/ankle function, but additional counseling is recommended for variance in appearance and higher ulceration rates in WB defects.","Grauberger, Jennifer N; Gibreel, Waleed O; Moran, Steven L; Carlsen, Brian T; Bakri, Karim",Microsurgery,572,31

This study aimed to develop a procedure-specific tool to assess the performance of LIHR and to evaluate its reliability and validity. METHODS The Global Operative Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills-Incisional Hernia (GOALS-IH) is a 7-item global rating scale developed by experts to evaluate the steps of LIHR (placement of trocars, adhesiolysis, estimation of mesh size and shape, mesh orientation and positioning, mesh fixation, knowledge and autonomy in use of instruments, overall competence), each rated on a 5-point Likert scale. During LIHR, 13 attending surgeons and fellows experienced in minimally invasive surgery (MIS) and 19 novice surgeons (postgraduate years [PGYs], 3-5) were evaluated at four teaching hospitals by the attending surgeon, a trained observer, and self-assessment using GOALS-IH, and by a previously validated 5-item general laparoscopic rating scale (GOALS). Interrater reliability was assessed by intraclass correlation (ICC), and internal consistency of rating items was assessed by Cronbach's alpha. Known-groups construct validity was assessed by using the t-test and by correlating of the number of self-reported LIHR cases with the total score. Concurrent validity was assessed by correlating the GOALS-IH score with the GOALS general rating scale. Data are presented as mean and 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS Interrater reliability for the total GOALS-IH score was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.60-0.89) between observers and attending surgeons, 0.81 (95% CI, 0.58-0.92) between participants and attending surgeons, and 0.89 (95% CI, 0.76-0.96) between participants and observers. Internal consistency was high (Cronbach's alpha, 0.93). Experienced surgeons performed significantly better than novices as assessed by GOALS-IH (31; 95% CI, 29-33 vs. 21; 95% CI, 19-24; p < 0.01). Very good correlation was found between GOALS-IH and previous LIHR experience (r = 0.82; p < 0.01) and strong correlation between GOALS-IH and generic GOALS total scores (r = 0.90; p < 0.01). CONCLUSION Surgical performance during clinical LIHR can be assessed reliably using GOALS-IH. Results can be used to provide formative feedback to the surgeon and to identify steps of the operation that would benefit from specific educational interventions.","Ghaderi, Iman; Vaillancourt, Marilou; Sroka, Gideon; Kaneva, Pepa A; Vassiliou, Melina C; Choy, Ian; Okrainec, Allan; Seagull, F Jacob; Sutton, Erica; George, Ivan; Park, Adrian; Brintzenhoff, Rita; Stefanidis, Dimitrios; Fried, Gerald M; Feldman, Liane S",Surgical endoscopy,572,10

It was found that a protein recovery of about 30% could be achieved. Increases in pH (pH 10.5, 11, and 11.5) not only improved protein recovery, but also increased protein denaturation evidenced by decreased solubility, decreased α-helix, increased β-sheet, and increased random coil. The color and texture of gels made from protein isolate were greatly affected by the pH values used for protein extraction. For the gels made from fillet mince, and protein isolates extracted at pH 10.5, 11, and 11.5, the ""L"" values were 78.96, 60.38, 57.74, and 54.39, the breaking forces were 205, 492, 585, and 458 g, and deformation values were 10.59, 8.07, 6.73, and 5.04 mm, respectively. Electrophoresis revealed protein degradation during alkali-aided extraction with MHC, the most predominant band, showing about 50% decrease in comparison with fillet mince. It also demonstrated that gelation not only caused cross-linking, but also autolysis with 53%, 56%, 59%, and 81% decrease in MHC intensity for fillet mince, protein isolates extracted at pH 10.5, 11, and 11.5, respectively. Fillet mince and protein isolates exhibited different storage modulus patterns during temperature sweep, implying different gelation mechanisms. This study proved the protein extracted from catfish byproducts was potential to be utilized as edible food components especially in gel making. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Catfish byproducts, which account for 70% of total weight and 50% of total protein of catfish, are normally used as animal feed, fertilizer, or even waste. This study demonstrated the potential of the utilization of catfish wastes to develop edible food components. This could reduce the total processing waste being discarded into the environment and nutrient loss, therefore increasing profitability of catfish industry.","Zhang, Yan; Chang, Sam K C",Journal of food science,572,31

So far, few cases of COVID-19 disease in patients with PH have been reported. Caution is warranted in interpreting this observation as data are evolving and several factors may influence the number of reported cases of PH and COVID-19. Social distancing and quarantine could play a role, especially for patients with chronic diseases who might be more vigilant of their potential for respiratory infection. In addition, PH is a rare disease, and because testing is not universal, we could be underestimating the number of cases.

Details on two underwater sites are reported: Cape Bruguieres, comprising > 260 recorded lithic artefacts at depths down to -2.4 m below sea level, and Flying Foam Passage where the find spot is associated with a submerged freshwater spring at -14 m. The sites were discovered through a purposeful research strategy designed to identify underwater targets, using an iterative process incorporating a variety of aerial and underwater remote sensing techniques and diver investigation within a predictive framework to map the submerged landscape within a depth range of 0-20 m. The condition and context of the lithic artefacts are analysed in order to unravel their depositional and taphonomic history and to corroborate their in situ position on a pre-inundation land surface, taking account of known geomorphological and climatic processes including cyclone activity that could have caused displacement and transportation from adjacent coasts. Geomorphological data and radiometric dates establish the chronological limits of the sites and demonstrate that they cannot be later than 7000 cal BP and 8500 cal BP respectively, based on the dates when they were finally submerged by sea-level rise. Comparison of underwater and onshore lithic assemblages shows differences that are consistent with this chronological interpretation. This article sets a foundation for the research strategies and technologies needed to identify archaeological targets at greater depth on the Australian continental shelf and elsewhere, building on the results presented. Emphasis is also placed on the need for legislation to better protect and manage underwater cultural heritage on the 2 million square kilometres of drowned landscapes that were once available for occupation in Australia, and where a major part of its human history must lie waiting to be discovered.","Benjamin, Jonathan; O'Leary, Michael; McDonald, Jo; Wiseman, Chelsea; McCarthy, John; Beckett, Emma; Morrison, Patrick; Stankiewicz, Francis; Leach, Jerem; Hacker, Jorg; Baggaley, Paul; Jerbić, Katarina; Fowler, Madeline; Fairweather, John; Jeffries, Peter; Ulm, Sean; Bailey, Geoff",PloS one,572,5

The Guideline was also reviewed and endorsed by the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG). It addresses the roles of small-bowel capsule endoscopy and device-assisted enteroscopy for diagnosis and treatment of small-bowel disorders. Main recommendations 1 ESGE recommends small-bowel video capsule endoscopy as the first-line investigation in patients with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). 2 In patients with overt obscure gastrointestinal bleeding, ESGE recommends performing small-bowel capsule endoscopy as soon as possible after the bleeding episode, optimally within 14 days, in order to maximize the diagnostic yield (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). 3 ESGE does not recommend the routine performance of second-look endoscopy prior to small-bowel capsule endoscopy; however whether to perform second-look endoscopy before capsule endoscopy in patients with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding or iron-deficiency anaemia should be decided on a case-by-case basis (strong recommendation, low quality evidence). 4 In patients with positive findings at small-bowel capsule endoscopy, ESGE recommends device-assisted enteroscopy to confirm and possibly treat lesions identified by capsule endoscopy (strong recommendation, high quality evidence). 5 ESGE recommends ileocolonoscopy as the first endoscopic examination for investigating patients with suspected Crohn's disease (strong recommendation, high quality evidence). In patients with suspected Crohn's disease and negative ileocolonoscopy findings, ESGE recommends small-bowel capsule endoscopy as the initial diagnostic modality for investigating the small bowel, in the absence of obstructive symptoms or known stenosis (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence).ESGE does not recommend routine small-bowel imaging or the use of the PillCam patency capsule prior to capsule endoscopy in these patients (strong recommendation, low quality evidence). In the presence of obstructive symptoms or known stenosis, ESGE recommends that dedicated small bowel cross-sectional imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance enterography/enteroclysis or computed tomography enterography/enteroclysis should be used first (strong recommendation, low quality evidence). 6 In patients with established Crohn's disease, based on ileocolonoscopy findings, ESGE recommends dedicated cross-sectional imaging for small-bowel evaluation since this has the potential to assess extent and location of any Crohn's disease lesions, to identify strictures, and to assess for extraluminal disease (strong recommendation, low quality evidence). In patients with unremarkable or nondiagnostic findings from such cross-sectional imaging of the small bowel, ESGE recommends small-bowel capsule endoscopy as a subsequent investigation, if deemed to influence patient management (strong recommendation, low quality evidence). When capsule endoscopy is indicated, ESGE recommends use of the PillCam patency capsule to confirm functional patency of the small bowel (strong recommendation, low quality evidence). 7 ESGE strongly recommends against the use of small-bowel capsule endoscopy for suspected coeliac disease but suggests that capsule endoscopy could be used in patients unwilling or unable to undergo conventional endoscopy (strong recommendation, low quality evidence).","Pennazio, Marco; Spada, Cristiano; Eliakim, Rami; Keuchel, Martin; May, Andrea; Mulder, Chris J; Rondonotti, Emanuele; Adler, Samuel N; Albert, Joerg; Baltes, Peter; Barbaro, Federico; Cellier, Christophe; Charton, Jean Pierre; Delvaux, Michel; Despott, Edward J; Domagk, Dirk; Klein, Amir; McAlindon, Mark; Rosa, Bruno; Rowse, Georgina; Sanders, David S; Saurin, Jean Christophe; Sidhu, Reena; Dumonceau, Jean-Marc; Hassan, Cesare; Gralnek, Ian M",Endoscopy,572,31

We quantified the effects of an unpleasant stimulus on physiological and behavioral parameters and evaluated how they are modified by sedation and analgesia. METHODS A 6-month study in the 30-bed intensive care unit (ICU) of a university hospital examined 21 sedated patients from various diagnostic groups. Hemodynamic and respiratory parameters, pupil size, facial expression, muscle tone, body movement, and the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) score were measured before and during intratracheal suctioning, first in sedated patients, after sedation was stopped, and after an opioid bolus. RESULTS Before intratracheal suctioning, patients had RASS scores of -1.8 ± 1.2 (mean ± standard deviation; sedation), -0.6 ± 1.7 (sedation stop), and -0.9 ± 1.4 (analgesia) (P = 0.014). Intratracheal suctioning significantly increased RASS during both sedation (to -0.6 ± 1.7) and sedation stop (to 1.0 ± 1.5) (both P < 0.01), but not during analgesia. Systolic blood pressure increased during sedation (by 9 ± 10 mmHg), during sedation stop (by 15 ± 17 mmHg) and during analgesia (by 9 ± 4 mmHg; all P < 0.01), but diastolic pressure only during sedation and sedation stop (both P < 0.01). Facial expression, body movement, and muscle tone changed significantly during the episodes of intratracheal suctioning. Heart rate, tidal volume, and pupil size remained stable under all conditions. CONCLUSIONS Intratracheal suctioning evoked significant changes in some physiological and behavioral parameters. Some physiological changes were suppressed by analgesia, but at our ICU's standard doses, neither analgesia nor sedation attenuated changes in behavioral parameters at the intensity tested.","Jeitziner, M-M; Schwendimann, R; Hamers, J P H; Rohrer, O; Hantikainen, V; Jakob, S M",Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica,572,26

Here, we report a large series of patients detailing the long-term experience of a single institution using the SMART coil among patients with intracranial aneurysms (IAs). METHODS Prospective data of 105 consecutive patients with 106 IAs treated using SMART coils was collected between March 2015 and July 2018. Clinical and angiographic data were analyzed. RESULTS Forty-nine patients (46.7%) presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage and 16 (14.2%) had recurrent aneurysms. Two patients had minor intraprocedural ruptures and remained neurologically stable. One patient had a thromboembolic complication with progressive neurologic decline. There was only one case microcatheter prolapse related to placement of a stent before coiling. An initial post-treatment modified Raymond-Roy Occlusion Classification (mRROC) I or II closure was achieved in 56 (52.8%) aneurysms. The average time to last follow-up was 8.4 months at which 70 (81.4%) aneurysms had mRROC I or II occlusion and a major recurrence was seen in 5 (5.8%) patients. Thirteen (12.3%) aneurysms required re-treatment of which one aneurysm was clipped.

Intense immediate postoperative pain after many spinal procedures makes its control of utmost importance. Preemptive injection of local anesthetics can significantly reduce postoperative pain during rest and movement; however, the analgesic effect is only maintained for a relatively short period of time. Whether betamethasone combined with local anesthetic for laminoplasty or laminectomy has better short-term and long-term effects than the local anesthetic alone has not been reported yet. METHODS The PRE-EASE trial is a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded endpoint, single-center clinical study including 116 participants scheduled for elective laminoplasty or laminectomy, with a 6 months' follow-up process. Preemptive local infiltration with betamethasone and ropivacaine (treatment group) or ropivacaine alone (control group) throughout the entire thickness of the planned incision site will be performed by the surgeon prior to making the incision. The primary outcome will be the cumulative butorphanol consumption within the first 48-h postoperative period.

Variations of TC-profiles were previously reported to potentially influence image quality in time critical MRI measurements. TC-curves from five injectors obtained during commonly used injection protocols were assessed according to representative quality criteria: (1) correlation strength between a fitted boxcar function and the TC-curve (cBCF) and (2) difference between true and expected injection time (dBIT). Additionally, the impact from technical injector properties: pump type, line volume, maximum injection power and type of contrast medium (CM) on the TC-profiles was evaluated. Injectors using a piston-syrinx (PS) mechanism for CM-injection performed significantly better than those working with a peristaltic roller pump (RP) technique. Besides injection mechanism, line filling volume showed a strong influence on the final TC-curves, where larger filling volumes induced worse cBCF- and dBIT-results. Therefore, to achieve an optimal bolus in clinical MRI use of a PS-injector seems recommendable. Besides their pump mechanism, RP-injectors appeared additionally hampered by their high volume line systems, pointing out an unfavourable coinicidence of these technical features in RP-injectors. This should be considered, particularly, in comparative or time-critical MRI-studies.","Doppler, Marcus; Moser, Ewald; Klickovic, Uros; Nasel, Christian",Scientific reports,572,12

INTRODUCTION Worldwide, non-urban populations experience higher levels of disease, mortality, and disease risk factors, yet most health services, including occupational therapy, are disproportionately located in urban areas. Research has predominantly focused on attracting therapists to non-urban practice by exploring generalized expressed needs from existing non-urban therapists, such as access to professional development, backfilling of jobs, peer and other practice supports, or enticing occupational therapy students through placement experiences. However, the types of service that non-urban occupational therapists routinely provide remains unclear. Clarifying the scope of occupational therapy services in non-urban areas will support educators and policy makers to plan curricula and services to support non-urban clinicians and communities.

METHODS Balloon-assisted transarterial embolization was performed in a series of 7 patients with AVMs (4 with brain AVMs, 1 with a dural arteriovenous fistula, and 2 with neck AVMs) by using Onyx delivered through the lumen of Scepter-C or Scepter XC coaxial balloon microcatheters. Following the initial balloon-catheter navigation into a feeding artery and the subsequent inflation of the balloon, the embolization was performed by using Onyx 18, Onyx 34, or both. RESULTS A total of 12 embolization sessions were performed via 17 arterial feeders in these 7 patients. In 1 patient, there was an arterial perforation from the inflation of the balloon; in all others, the embolization goals were successfully achieved with no adverse events. CONCLUSION The balloon microcatheters showed excellent navigability, and there were no problems with retrieval or with the repeated inflation and deflation of the balloons. A proximal Onyx plug, which is crucial in many AVM embolizations, was not necessary with this technique. Additionally, fluoroscopy and procedural times seemed lower with this technique compared with conventional embolization methods.","Jagadeesan, Bharathi D; Grigoryan, Mikayel; Hassan, Ameer E; Grande, Andrew W; Tummala, Ramachandra P",Neurosurgery,572,1

As such it can only be a snapshot caught in time; it is not a diary of events. The Coronavirus Act 2020 gives Government enormous powers and was passed by Parliament in one day of debate immediately before it closed early for the Easter break. In March, the government imposed a ""lockdown: the closure of all"" but ""essential"" businesses and people other than essential workers must work from home but are allowed out for exercise and food shopping but must maintain 2 m apart, the ""social distancing rule"". The aim is to suppress the spread of the virus, reduce the death toll and ""protect the National Health Service (NHS)"" which needed time to empty wards and expand its intensive care unit (ICU) capability to deal with an expected influx of thousands of very sick patients. I discuss whether this strategy is working, how and why it has rapidly been altered to respond to criticism. Why was the Government so slow to seek the help of private laboratories to assist with testing? Why was the personal protective equipment (PPE) guidance altered only after criticism? I look at the impact of the lockdown on the UK economy, the changes to practice of medicine and speeding of scientific research. Cooperating with the lockdown has its price; is it harming the health and mental health of children, people living in households with potentially abusive partners or parents and those who are disabled or financially desperate? Is the cure worse than the disease? The Economy is being devastated by the lockdown and each day of lockdown it is worse. Is litigation being seeded even now by the pandemic? Notwithstanding unprecedented Government financial help many businesses are on the edge of collapse, people will lose their jobs and pensioners income. The winners include pharmacies, supermarkets, online food retailers, Amazon, online apps, providers of video games, services, streaming and scientific research laboratories, manufacturers of testing kits, ventilators, hand sanitisers, coffins, undertakers, etc. The British public is cooperating with lockdown but are we less productive at home? Parents with babies and children often child minders, school, grandparents or paid help which is not now available. Will current reliance on video-conferencing and video calls permanently change the way we work and will we need smaller city offices? Will we travel less? Will medical and legal practice and civil and criminal trials be generally carried out remotely? Will social distancing with self-isolation and job losses and business failures fuel depression? Is Covid-19 comparable to past epidemics like the Plague and Spanish flu?","Brahams, Diana",The Medico-legal journal,572,1

Modern farming conditions may also increase viral transmission and potential zoonotic spread. We describe here the metagenomics-derived virome in the feces of 24 healthy and 12 diarrheic piglets on a high-density farm. An average of 4.2 different mammalian viruses were shed by healthy piglets, reflecting a high level of asymptomatic infections. Diarrheic pigs shed an average of 5.4 different mammalian viruses. Ninety-nine percent of the viral sequences were related to the RNA virus families Picornaviridae, Astroviridae, Coronaviridae, and Caliciviridae, while 1% were related to the small DNA virus families Circoviridae, and Parvoviridae. Porcine RNA viruses identified, in order of decreasing number of sequence reads, consisted of kobuviruses, astroviruses, enteroviruses, sapoviruses, sapeloviruses, coronaviruses, bocaviruses, and teschoviruses. The near-full genomes of multiple novel species of porcine astroviruses and bocaviruses were generated and phylogenetically analyzed. Multiple small circular DNA genomes encoding replicase proteins plus two highly divergent members of the Picornavirales order were also characterized. The possible origin of these viral genomes from pig-infecting protozoans and nematodes, based on closest sequence similarities, is discussed. In summary, an unbiased survey of viruses in the feces of intensely farmed animals revealed frequent coinfections with a highly diverse set of viruses providing favorable conditions for viral recombination. Viral surveys of animals can readily document the circulation of known and new viruses, facilitating the detection of emerging viruses and prospective evaluation of their pathogenic and zoonotic potentials.","Shan, Tongling; Li, Linlin; Simmonds, Peter; Wang, Chunlin; Moeser, Adam; Delwart, Eric",Journal of virology,572,19

Ablation or isolation of focal triggers around the pulmonary veins can eliminate arrhythmia substrates for patients with paroxysmal, lone atrial fibrillation. However, limited pulmonary vein isolation strategies do not address reentrant circuits common in persistent and longstanding persistent patients with structural heart disease and enlarged atria. The convergent procedure is a hybrid ablation treatment for atrial fibrillation. It consists of surgical ablation of the posterior left atrium through a minimally invasive closed-chest approach followed by endocardial catheter ablation. The convergent procedure was developed to treat atrial fibrillation by creating a complete and comprehensive pattern of linear lesions on the left atrial backwall under direct endoscopic visualization while avoiding chest incisions and deflation of the lungs. Endocardial ablation follows the epicardial procedure to confirm lesion integrity and supplement the epicardial procedure, which is performed in a staged fashion.","Verberkmoes, Niels; Olsthoorn, Jules; Dekker, Lukas; Pieraets, Michiel; Ouss, Alexandre",Multimedia manual of cardiothoracic surgery : MMCTS,572,17

The epidemiological relationship between carceral facilities and community health during the COVID-19 pandemic, however, remains largely unexamined. Using data from Cook County Jail, we examine temporal patterns in the relationship between jail cycling (i.e., arrest and processing of individuals through jails before release) and community cases of COVID-19 in Chicago ZIP codes. We use multivariate regression analyses and a machine-learning tool, elastic regression, with 1,706 demographic control variables. We find that for each arrested individual cycled through Cook County Jail in March 2020, five additional cases of COVID-19 in their ZIP code of residence are independently attributable to the jail as of August. A total 86% of this additional disease burden is borne by majority-Black and/or -Hispanic ZIPs, accounting for 17% of cumulative COVID-19 cases in these ZIPs, 6% in majority-White ZIPs, and 13% across all ZIPs. Jail cycling in March alone can independently account for 21% of racial COVID-19 disparities in Chicago as of August 2020. Relative to all demographic variables in our analysis, jail cycling is the strongest predictor of COVID-19 rates, considerably exceeding poverty, race, and population density, for example. Arrest and incarceration policies appear to be increasing COVID-19 incidence in communities. Our data suggest that jails function as infectious disease multipliers and epidemiological pumps that are especially affecting marginalized communities. Given disproportionate policing and incarceration of racialized residents nationally, the criminal punishment system may explain a large proportion of racial COVID-19 disparities noted across the United States.","Reinhart, Eric; Chen, Daniel L",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,572,31

We introduced unaided delta-shaped anastomosis (uDelta), a novel anastomosis technique, for gastroduodenostomy after pure SIDG, and compared the results with those of previously reported Roux-en-Y anastomosis (RY). MATERIALS AND METHODS Between March 2014 and March 2015, SIDG with D1+ lymph node dissection was performed for early gastric cancer through a 2.5-cm transumbilical incision without any additional port. uDelta was performed by the operator alone, without any intracorporeal assistance. RESULTS uDelta was performed on 11 patents, and uncut RY was performed on 5-patients without open or multiport conversion. R0 resection was performed in all cases. No significant differences were observed in mean age and body mass index between patients who underwent uDelta or RY. Mean operation times were 214.5±36.2 minutes for uDelta and 240.8±65.9 minutes for RY, which was not significantly different. Reconstruction time for uDelta was shorter than that for RY, with marginal statistical significance (26.1±8.3 minutes vs. 38.0±9.1 minutes, P=0.05). There were no intraoperative transfusions, 30-day mortality, or anastomosis-related complications in either group. Average length of hospital stay was 8.2±1.9 days in the uDelta group and 7.2±0.8 days in the RY group (P=0.320).

Hemodynamics including blood velocity, volume flow rate (VFR), and intravascular pressure are thought to be prognostic indicators of aneurysm development. We hypothesize that treatment of cerebral aneurysm using a flow-diverting stent will bring these hemodynamic parameters closer to those observed on the contralateral side. In the current study, a patient with a giant cerebral aneurysm was studied pre- and postoperatively using phase contrast MRI (PC-MRI) to measure the hemodynamic changes resulting from the deployment of a flow-diverting stent. PC-MRI was used to calculate intravascular pressure, which was compared to more invasive endovascular catheter-derived measurements. After stent placement, the measured VFRs in vessels of the treated hemisphere approached those measured on the contralateral side, and flow symmetry changed from a laterality index of -0.153 to 0.116 in the middle cerebral artery. Pressure estimates derived from the PC-MRI velocity data had an average difference of 6.1% as compared to invasive catheter transducer measurements. PC-MRI can measure the hemodynamic parameters with the same accuracy as invasive methods pre- and postoperatively.","MacDonald, Matthew Ethan; Dolati, Parviz; Mitha, Alim P; Eesa, Muneer; Wong, John H; Frayne, Richard",Radiology case reports,572,31

METHODS Retrospective longitudinal observational study of ER accesses for psychiatric evaluation was performed, comparing two periods (9 March-3 May 2020 vs. 9 March-3 May 2019). Data (number of admissions, key baseline demographic and clinical variables) were extracted from the ER databases of referral centres in a well-defined geographic area of North-Eastern Italy (Cesena, Ravenna, Forlì, and Rimini). RESULTS A 15% reduction of psychiatric referrals was observed, together with a 17% reduction in the total number of patients referring to the ER. This reduction was most evident in the first month of the lockdown period (almost 25% reduction of both referrals and patients). Female gender (OR: 1.52: 95%, CI: 1.12-2.06) and being a local resident (OR: 1.54: 95%CI: 1.02-2.34) were factors associated with the decrease. CONCLUSIONS Lockdown changed dramatically health priorities in the local population, including people with mental health. We speculate that our observations do not only refer to the confinement due to the lockdown regime but also to fear of contagion and adoption of different coping strategies, especially in women.

On the background of reported decline in many countries with high asthma prevalence during late 1990s. METHODS Annual asthma hospitalisation (ICD9-CM: 493 or ICD10-AM: J45-46)* and population data from 1994 to 2008, of children aged 0-14 years old, were obtained from the Australian National Hospital Morbidity Database, from the Hospital Authority in Hong Kong and from the Ministry of Health in Singapore. Data were stratified in two age groups: 0-4 and 5-14 years old, and also in different periods of calendar years. Time-series regression analyses were used to examine temporal trends. Diagnostic transfer was addressed by examining bronchitis hospitalisations. RESULTS Significant decreases of up to 6.5% per annum in childhood asthma hospitalisation rates were found over the study period. However, the latter half of the study period showed increases in hospitalisation rates in all countries studied. No evidence of diagnostic transfer was found. CONCLUSION Although there has been a decrease in childhood asthma hospitalisation rates since the 1990s, a modest increase was observed from 2003 to 2008.

The prevalence of COVID-19 among older adults in independent/assisted living is not understood. Objectives To conduct surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 and describe symptoms of COVID-19 among residents and staff of an independent/assisted living community. Design, Setting, and Participants In March 2020, public health surveillance of staff and residents was conducted on site at an assisted and independent living residence for older adults in Seattle, Washington, after exposure to 2 residents who were hospitalized with COVID-19. Exposures Surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 infection in a congregate setting implementing social isolation and infection prevention protocols. Main Outcomes and Measures SARS-CoV-2 real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed on nasopharyngeal swabs from residents and staff; a symptom questionnaire was completed assessing fever, cough, and other symptoms for the preceding 14 days. Residents were retested for SARS-CoV-2 7 days after initial screening. Results Testing was performed on 80 residents; 62 were women (77%), with mean age of 86 (range, 69-102) years. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 3 of 80 residents (3.8%); none felt ill, 1 male resident reported resolved cough and 1 loose stool during the preceding 14 days. Virus was also detected in 2 of 62 staff (3.2%); both were symptomatic. One week later, resident SARS-CoV-2 testing was repeated and 1 new infection detected (asymptomatic). All residents remained in isolation and were clinically stable 14 days after the second test. Conclusions and Relevance Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic residents highlights challenges in protecting older adults living in congregate settings. In this study, symptom screening failed to identify residents with infections and all 4 residents with SARS-CoV-2 remained asymptomatic after 14 days. Although 1 asymptomatic infection was found on retesting, a widespread facility outbreak was avoided. Compared with skilled nursing settings, in assisted/independent living communities, early surveillance to identify asymptomatic persons among residents and staff, in combination with adherence to recommended preventive strategies, may reduce viral spread.","Roxby, Alison C; Greninger, Alexander L; Hatfield, Kelly M; Lynch, John B; Dellit, Timothy H; James, Allison; Taylor, Joanne; Page, Libby C; Kimball, Anne; Arons, Melissa; Munanga, Albert; Stone, Nimalie; Jernigan, John A; Reddy, Sujan C; Lewis, James; Cohen, Seth A; Jerome, Keith R; Duchin, Jeffrey S; Neme, Santiago",JAMA internal medicine,572,31

We sought to evaluate the ability of different selection paradigms to predict favorable outcomes. METHODS Review of a prospectively collected database of endovascular patients with anterior circulation LVOS, adequate CT perfusion (CTP), National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) ≥10 from September 2010 to March 2016. Patients were retrospectively assessed for thrombectomy eligibility by 4 mismatch criteria: Perfusion-Imaging Mismatch (PIM): between CTP-derived perfusion defect and ischemic core volumes; Clinical-Core Mismatch (CCM): between age-adjusted NIHSS and CTP core; Clinical-ASPECTS Mismatch (CAM-1): between age-adjusted NIHSS and ASPECTS; Clinical-ASPECTS Mismatch (CAM-2): between NIHSS and ASPECTS. Outcome measures were inclusion rates for each paradigm and their ability to predict good outcomes (90-day modified Rankin Scale 0-2). RESULTS Three hundred eighty-four patients qualified. CAM-2 and CCM had higher inclusion (89.3 and 82.3%) vs. CAM-1 (67.7%) and PIM (63.3%). Proportions of selected patients were statistically different except for PIM and CAM-1 (p = 0.19), with PIM having the highest disagreement. There were no differences in good outcome rates between PIM(+)/PIM(-) (52.2 vs. 48.5%; p = 0.51) and CAM-2(+)/CAM-2(-) (52.4 vs. 38.5%; p = 0.12). CCM(+) and CAM-1(+) had higher rates compared to nonselected counterparts (53.4 vs. 38.7%, p = 0.03; 56.6 vs. 38.6%; p = 0.002). The abilities of PIM, CCM, CAM-1, and CAM-2 to predict outcomes were similar according to the c-statistic, Akaike and Bayesian information criterion. CONCLUSIONS For patients with NIHSS ≥10, PIM appears to disqualify more patients without improving outcomes. CCM may improve selection, combining a high inclusion rate with optimal outcome discrimination across (+) and (-) patients.

We explore different post-confinement scenarios by using a stochastic modified SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) model that accounts for the spread of infection during the latent period and also incorporates time-decaying effects due to potential loss of acquired immunity, people's increasing awareness of social distancing and the use of non-pharmaceutical interventions. Our results suggest that lockdowns should remain in place for at least 60 days to prevent epidemic growth, as well as a potentially larger second wave of SARS-CoV-2 cases occurring within months. The best-case scenario should also gradually incorporate workers in a daily proportion at most 50% higher than during the confinement period. We show that decaying immunity and particularly awareness and behaviour have 99% significant effects on both the current wave of infection and on preventing COVID-19 re-emergence.

OBJECTIVE The immunomodulatory effect of water extract of cinnamon bark (CWE) on cytokine secretion and involvement of intracellular signaling molecules in activated T cells have been examined. MATERIALS AND METHODS Mice were orally administered CWE for 7 days. Serum was obtained 90 min after intravenous injection of anti-CD3 antibody (Ab). Splenocytes were cultured with anti-CD3 Ab and CWE for cytokine expression, cell cycle, apoptotic/necrotic changes, and viability. IκBα, p38, JNK, ERK1/2, STAT4, and STAT6 were analyzed using western blotting. RESULTS Administration of CWE decreased systemic levels of IFN-γ, but not the levels of IL-4 or IL-2. In vitro, CWE inhibited anti-CD3 Ab-stimulated IFN-γ and IL-4 at the mRNA and secreted protein levels. Despite its inhibition of IL-2 transcript, CWE enhanced IL-2 secretion. CWE treatment caused a reduction in the sub-G1 phase, accompanied by an increased ratio of apoptotic cells to necrotic cells. The increased IL-2 secretion by CWE was not mediated by its direct effect on CD4 T cells. CWE inhibited the activation of p38, JNK, ERK1/2, and STAT4, but not IκBα degradation or STAT6. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS These observations provided evidence that CWE was able to down-regulate IFN-γ expression in activated T cells without altering IL-2 production, involving inhibition of p38, JNK, ERK1/2, and STAT4.

During period 1, all pigs remained in thermoneutral conditions (TN; 20°C) and were ad libitum fed. During period 2, pigs were exposed to: (1) constant HS conditions (32°C) and fed ad libitum (n = 7), or (2) TN conditions and pair-fed (PFTN; n = 10) to minimize the confounding effects of dissimilar feed intake. All pigs received an intravenous glucose tolerance test (GTT) and an epinephrine challenge (EC) in period 1, and during the early and late phases of period 2.

Interviewees described strong emotions of despair, depression and anger, which were intensified when the rest of society returned back to a new routine, whilst they were still under lockdown. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS the measures imposed on residents by managements of CCRCs during the lockdown, and the emotional responses of distress among some of the residents, revealed that CCRCs have components of total institutions, not normally evident. This underscores the hidden emotional costs of the lockdown among those whose autonomy was compromised.","Ayalon, Liat; Avidor, Sharon",Age and ageing,572,16

The role of fixation of mesh in laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair remains controversial. Mesh materials have been engineered to anatomically conform to the pelvis to potentially reduce or eliminate the need for fixation. This study evaluates the outcomes of laparoscopic inguinal hernia utilizing a device consisting of a lightweight polypropylene mesh with a nitinol frame (Rebound HRD) compared with repair with lightweight polypropylene mesh with permanent tack fixation. METHODS A prospective randomized trial evaluating the outcomes of laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair with a lightweight polypropylene mesh with a nitinol frame (N-LWM) compared with standard lightweight polypropylene mesh (LWM) was conducted. Randomization was performed at an N-LWM to LWM ratio of 2:1. Repairs were standardized to a laparoscopic extraperitoneal approach without fixation for N-LWM and titanium tack fixation for LWM repairs. Follow-up assessments were performed at 7 days, 6 months, and 1 year. Outcome measures include visual analog pain scale (VAS), Short Form 36 (SF-36), Carolinas Comfort Scale (CCS), operative details, complications, and recurrences. RESULTS There were 47 patients that underwent laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair and adhered to study protocol (31 N-LWM, 16 LWM). The groups did not differ significantly in age, body mass index, ethnicity, or employment. The N-LWM group had bilateral mesh placed in 51.6% and LWM 43.8% (P = .76). Operative duration was similar, 59.6 ± 23.1 minutes for LWM and 62.4 ± 26.7 minutes for N-LWM (P = .705) as was mesh handling time was 5.4 ± 3.1 minutes LWM versus 7.3 ± 3.9 minutes N-LWM (P = .053). VAS, CCS, and SF-36 survey results were similar between groups. There was one recurrence (0.03%) in the N-LWM group. CONCLUSIONS Nitinol-framed lightweight polypropylene mesh may be safely used during laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair with outcomes comparable to LWM at 1 year. N-LWM does not impact operating room time, mesh handling time, pain, recurrences, or complications.","Bower, Curtis; Hazey, Jeffrey W; Jones, Edward L; Perry, Kyle A; Davenport, Daniel L; Roth, J Scott",Surgical innovation,572,16

Epidemiological evidence points to important health benefits of immediate ART initiation; however, the policy's economic impact remains unknown. Methods: We conducted a stepped-wedge cluster-randomised controlled trial in Eswatini to determine the causal impact of immediate ART initiation on patients' economic welfare. Fourteen healthcare facilities were non-randomly matched in pairs and then randomly allocated to transition from the standard of care (ART eligibility at CD4 counts of < 350 cells/mm3 until September 2016 and <500 cells/mm3 thereafter) to the 'Early Initiation of ART for All' (EAAA) intervention at one of seven timepoints. Patients, healthcare personnel, and outcome assessors remained unblinded. Data was collected via standardised paper-based surveys with HIV-positive, ART-naïve adults who were neither pregnant nor breastfeeding. Outcomes were patients' time use, employment status, household expenditures and household wealth. Results: A total sample of 3,019 participants were interviewed over the duration of the study. The mean number of participants approached at each facility and time step varied from 4 to 112 participants. Using mixed-effects negative binomial regressions accounting for time trends and clustering, we found no significant difference between study arms for any economic outcome. Specifically, the EAAA intervention had no significant effect on non-resting time use (RR= 1.00, [CI: 0.96, 1.05, p=0.93]) or income-generating time use (RR= 0.94, [CI: 0.73,1.20, p=0.61]). Employment and household expenditures decreased slightly but not significantly in the EAAA group, with risk ratios of 0.93 [CI: 0.82, 1.04, p=0.21] and 0.92 [CI: 0.79, 1.06, p=0.26], respectively. We also found no significant treatment effect on households' asset ownership and living standards (RR=0.96, [CI 0.92, 1.00, p=0.253]). Lastly, there was no evidence of heterogeneity in effect estimates by patients' sex, age, education, timing of HIV diagnosis and ART initiation. Conclusions: Given the neutral effect on patients' economic welfare but positive effects on health, our findings support further investments into scaling-up immediate ART for all HIV patients.

While the concentrations of AMX and ENR tested were not toxic, OXY decreased plant growth and cell division. OXY induced hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) accumulation and related oxidative stress through its interference with the activities of mitochondria electron transport chain enzymes, although those deleterious effects could be ameliorated by the presence of AMX and/or ENR, which prevented the overaccumulation of ROS by increasing catalase enzyme activity. L. minor plants accumulated significant quantities of AMX, ENR and OXY from the media, although competitive uptakes were observed when plants were submitted to binary or tertiary mixtures of those antibiotics. Our results therefore indicate L. minor as a candidate for phytoremediation of service waters contaminated by AMX, ENR, and/or OXY.","Gomes, Marcelo Pedrosa; Moreira Brito, Júlio César; Cristina Rocha, Daiane; Navarro-Silva, Mário Antônio; Juneau, Philippe",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,572,1

The purpose of this study was to determine the potential prognostic value of serum lncRNA TINCR in BC. METHODS Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to detect serum lncRNA TINCR levels in 72 triple-negative BC (TNBC) patients, 105 non-TNBC patients, 60 benign breast disease patients and 86 healthy subjects. RESULTS The results showed that serum lncRNA TINCR level was significantly increased in BC, especially in TNBC. High circulating lncRNA TINCR was significantly correlated with worse clinicopathological features and clinical outcome of TNBC. Multivariate analysis revealed that serum lncRNA TINCR was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival of TNBC. However, little association was found between serum lncRNA TINCR and the prognosis of non-TNBC.

Nurse managers are being called not only to help their organizations manage the crisis operationally, but also to help the nurses they supervise mentally, emotionally, and even ethically. DISCUSSION This article provides recommendations for how nurse managers can use the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses Healthy Work Environment standards and make the experience of stress more productive. CONCLUSION Stress comes with the territory in nursing, but nurses can work together to make stress their ally and not their enemy.

Currently, there is still no definite and efficacious therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, our understanding of the physiopathology of the infection, and risk elements for severity and mortality, is incomplete. PATIENTS AND METHODS One largely neglected element that could affect prognosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the vitamin status of population. The purpose of this review is to evaluate whether a vitamin insufficiency could provoke an augmented risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or the appearance of major complications. In particular, we evaluated the presence of studies related to the state and effects of vitamin D, C, B, and A in subjects with SARS-CoV-2 disease. RESULTS Although, actually, the interest in a possible use for vitamin supplementation in SARS-CoV-2 patients is essentially based on indirect data, we tried to examine the evidence about a favorable effect of vitamin supplementation in the therapy of the infection and its complications. CONCLUSIONS Supplements with vitamin A, B, C, D, and E could represent an inexpensive and sufficiently safe approach, and a useful therapeutic complement. However, solid clinical research data are expected to support such claim.","Allegra, A; Tonacci, A; Pioggia, G; Musolino, C; Gangemi, S",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,572,20

The impact on feasibility and outcome of rehabilitation during COVID-19 actually remains unclear. Nosocomial infection of health care workers or hospitalized patients are common and prevention of nosocomial infections during rehabilitation are challenging. Therefore, we analyzed a cohort of nosocomial infected COVID-19 patients in a single center inpatient rehabilitation clinic and describe performance and outcome. DESIGN The cohort (n=27) describes patients with nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infection while participating in neuro-musculoskeletal rehabilitation (NMSR). Infection was caused by an initially unidentified so-called superspreader. We compared this cohort with all NMSR inpatients of 2019 (comparison group). Normally distributed continuous variables were presented as mean with standard deviation (SD) and the T-Test was used for comparison between groups. Linear regression was used to assess the impact of COVID-19 on FIM at discharge. RESULTS COVID-19 patients were mostly male (66.7%) with an age of 71.5 ±12.3 years. Age, sex and cumulated comorbidities of the comparison group (n=786) were not different from the COVID-19 group. 92.6% of COVID-19 patients had a mild or moderate course and two patients had to be referred to acute hospital due to respiratory failure and one of these patients died in the acute hospital. After implementation of a strict hygiene concept, no further nosocomial COVID-19 infections were detected. The rehabilitation duration was significant longer in the COVID-19 group, 54.2±23.6 days versus 32.1±17.7 days (p<0.001). Daily therapy duration was 132.3±44 minutes before SARS-CoV-2 infection and reduced to 81.9±27.3 minutes during COVID-19 (p<0.001). After discontinuation of isolation measures, therapy duration increased significantly (99.3±70.2 minutes; p<0.05).The baseline Functional Independence Measure (FIM) score was higher in the COVID-19 group (91.93 ±25.64 vs. 82.98 ±22.73 points) and FIM improvements were lower in COVID-19 patients than in the 2019 comparison group (6.96 ±8.96 vs 20.3 ±15.98 points; p<0.001). COVID-19 infection itself had a strong negative impact on FIM change as identified by regression analysis. Linear regression analysis showed that COVID-19 reduced the FIM at discharge by 8.9 points (95% CI -14.725;-3.097; p=0.003) after correction for FIM at admission, age, sex and morbidity index at admission. CONCLUSION In conclusion, COVID-19 had a strong negative impact on rehabilitation benefits as assessed by FIM. NMSR could be continued but all patients received less therapy minutes during isolation. After implementation of a strict COVID-19 specific hygiene concept no further infections were detected.","Spielmanns, Marc; Pekacka-Egli, Anna-Maria; Cecon, Mikis; Witassek, Fabienne; Schoendorf, Sabine; Lutz, Dietmar; Hermann, Matthias",American journal of physical medicine & rehabilitation,572,1

Confounding factors in previous studies include the use of different experimental approaches, ascent profiles, duration and severity of exposure and plausibly environmental factors associated with altitude exposure. One aim of the present study was to determine CVR throughout acclimatization to high altitude when controlling for these. Middle cerebral artery mean velocity (MCAv mean) CVR was assessed during hyperventilation (hypocapnia) and CO2 administration (hypercapnia) with background normoxia (sea level (SL)) and hypoxia (3,454 m) in nine healthy volunteers (26 ± 4 years (mean ± s.d.)) at SL, and after 30 minutes (HA0), 3 (HA3) and 22 (HA22) days of high-altitude (3,454 m) exposure. At altitude, ventilation was increased whereas MCAv mean was not altered. Hypercapnic CVR was decreased at HA0 (1.16% ± 0.16%/mm Hg, mean ± s.e.m.), whereas both hyper- and hypocapnic CVR were increased at HA3 (3.13% ± 0.18% and 2.96% ± 0.10%/mm Hg) and HA22 (3.32% ± 0.12% and 3.24% ± 0.14%/mm Hg) compared with SL (1.98% ± 0.22% and 2.38% ± 0.10%/mm Hg; P < 0.01) regardless of background oxygenation.

However, tissue plasminogen activator only succeeds in recanalizing large vessel arterial occlusion in a minority of patients. We hypothesized that anterior circulation ischemic stroke patients, selected with 'dual target' vessel occlusion and evidence of salvageable brain using computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging 'mismatch' within 4·5 h of onset, would have improved reperfusion and early neurological improvement when treated with intra-arterial clot retrieval after intravenous tissue plasminogen activator compared with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator alone. STUDY DESIGN EXTEND-IA is an investigator-initiated, phase II, multicenter prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded-endpoint study. Ischemic stroke patients receiving standard 0·9 mg/kg intravenous tissue plasminogen activator within 4·5 h of stroke onset who have good prestroke functional status (modified Rankin Scale <2, no upper age limit) will undergo multimodal computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging.

We searched the electronic databases of Medline and Embase for articles published between 2009 and 24 March 2016 and included the references of a systematic review performed for the period before 2009. Primary cross-sectional and longitudinal studies were included when outcome data were described in terms of clinically assessed soft tissue shoulder disorders and at least two levels of work-related exposure were mentioned (exposed vs less or non-exposed). Two authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed study quality. For longitudinal studies, we performed meta-analyses and used GRADE (Grades of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) to assess the evidence for the associations between risk factors and the onset of shoulder disorders. Twenty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria. In total, 16 300 patients with specific soft tissue shoulder disorders from a population of 2 413 722 workers from Denmark, Finland, France, Germany and Poland were included in the meta-analysis of one case-control and six prospective cohort studies. This meta-analysis revealed moderate evidence for associations between shoulder disorders and arm-hand elevation (OR=1.9, 95% CI 1.47 to 2.47) and shoulder load (OR=2.0, 95% CI 1.90 to 2.10) and low to very low evidence for hand force exertion (OR=1.5, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.87), hand-arm vibration (OR=1.3, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.77), psychosocial job demands (OR=1.1, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.25) and working together with temporary workers (OR=2.2, 95% CI 1.2 to 4.2). Low-quality evidence for no associations was found for arm repetition, social support, decision latitude, job control and job security. Moderate evidence was found that arm-hand elevation and shoulder load double the risk of specific shoulder disorders. Low to very-low-quality evidence was found for an association between hand force exertion, hand-arm vibration, psychosocial job demands and working together with temporary workers and the incidence of specific shoulder disorders.","van der Molen, Henk F; Foresti, Chiara; Daams, Joost G; Frings-Dresen, Monique H W; Kuijer, P Paul F M",Occupational and environmental medicine,572,26

This study examined peritoneum as a potential graft material and the in vivo transfer of peritoneum into a functional artery like conduit after end to end anastomosis into the common carotid artery of sheep. The aim was to investigate whether implantation of a peritoneal tube into the arterial tree results in a structure with function, histological findings, and gene expression like an artery, and whether such arterialisation occurs through a conversion of the phenotype of peritoneal cells or from host cell migration into the implant. Methods Peritoneum with adherent rectus aponeurosis from sheep was used to form tubular vascular grafts that were implanted into the common carotid artery of six sheep, then removed after five months. Two sheep received allogenic peritoneal grafts and four sheep received autologous peritoneal grafts. Results One sheep died shortly after implantation, so five of the six sheep were followed. Five months after implantation, four of the five remaining grafts were patent. Three of four patent grafts were aneurysmal. The four patent grafts had developed an endothelial layer indistinguishable from that of the adjacent normal artery, and a medial layer with smooth muscle cells with a surrounding adventitia. The new conduit displayed vasomotor function not present at the time of implantation. DNA genotyping showed that the media in the new conduit consisted of recipient smooth muscle cells. Little difference in mRNA expression was demonstrated between the post-implantation conduit and normal artery. Conclusion During a five month implantation period in the arterial system, peritoneum converted into a tissue that histologically and functionally resembled a normal artery, with a functional genetic expression that resembled that of an artery. Single nucleotide polymorphism analysis indicated that this conversion occurs through host cell migration into the graft.","Davik, Petter; Chabadova, Zuzana; Altreuther, Martin; Leinan, Ingeborg; Bandaru, Sashidar; Akyürek, Levent M; Mattsson, Erney",EJVES vascular forum,572,31

Small studies supporting imaging based patient selection have been published. The goal of this larger study was to determine if perfusion imaging could impact on functional outcomes in patients undergoing stroke interventions. METHODS All patients who had undergone endovascular therapy for anterior circulation strokes over a 7 year period were retrospectively analyzed. The pre-intervention perfusion imaging was assessed for size of cerebral blood volume (CBV), cerebral blood flow and mean transit time (MTT) abnormalities. A perfusion mismatch for irreversible versus reversible ischemia was based on CBV and MTT. Clinical outcome and mortality were based on the 90 day modified Rankin Scale. An analysis of the pre-intervention perfusion parameters was then performed to determine any impact on functional outcomes. RESULTS 110 patients underwent endovascular therapy for anterior circulation strokes. A younger age and lower National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score were important clinical predictors of favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale ≤ 2). The extent of the CBV abnormality and percentage of CBV/MTT mismatch were the strongest imaging predictors of outcome and mortality. A CBV area of 229.5 mm(2) (± 290) was seen for favorable outcomes versus 968 mm(2) (± 1173) for poor outcomes (p<0.0001). A CBV/MTT mismatch of 91% (± 10.7) was seen for favorable outcomes versus 72.5% (± 31.6) for poor outcomes (p=0.0001). The CBV area was 273 mm(2) (± 392) in patients without mortality versus 1401.1 mm(2) (± 1310) in patients with mortality (p<0.0001). Patients who survived had a mean CBV/MTT mismatch of 90.2% (± 12.5) versus 61.1% (± 35.2) for those who did not (p<0.0001). A CBV lesion approximately greater than one-third of the middle cerebral artery distribution predicted a poor outcome and mortality. CONCLUSION The extent of pre-intervention CBV abnormality is a strong predictor of functional outcomes following endovascular stroke therapy. This information can aid in patient selection and improve procedure efficacy.","Rai, Ansaar T; Raghuram, Karthikram; Carpenter, Jeffrey S; Domico, Jennifer; Hobbs, Gerald",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,572,27

While all reovirus serotypes use junctional adhesion molecule-A as a cellular receptor, they differ in their utilization of carbohydrate coreceptors. This observation raises the possibility that carbohydrate binding by σ1 influences reovirus pathology in the CNS. In this study, we sought to define the function of carbohydrate binding in reovirus neuropathogenesis. Newborn mice were inoculated intramuscularly with wild-type strain type 3 Dearing (T3D) and T3D-σ1R202W, a point mutant T3D derivative that does not bind sialic acid (SA). Infected mice were monitored for survival, and viral loads at the sites of primary and secondary replication were quantified. Fewer mice inoculated with the wild-type virus survived in comparison to those inoculated with the mutant virus. The wild-type virus also produced higher titers in the spinal cord and brain at late times postinoculation but lower titers in the liver in comparison to those produced by the mutant virus. In addition, the wild-type virus was more virulent and produced higher titers in the brain than the mutant following intracranial inoculation. These animal infectivity studies suggest that T3D-σ1R202W harbors a defect in neural growth. Concordantly, compared with the wild-type virus, the mutant virus displayed a decreased capacity to infect and replicate in primary cultures of cortical neurons, a property dependent on cell surface SA. These results suggest that SA binding enhances the kinetics of reovirus replication in neural tissues and highlight a functional role for sialylated glycans as reovirus coreceptors in the CNS.","Frierson, Johnna M; Pruijssers, Andrea J; Konopka, Jennifer L; Reiter, Dirk M; Abel, Ty W; Stehle, Thilo; Dermody, Terence S",Journal of virology,572,19

Whilst acute studies in mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) type II mice revealed that intrathecally-delivered enzyme (into thoraco-lumbar CSF) accesses the brain, the impact of longer-term treatment of affected subjects via this route is unknown. This approach is presently being utilized to treat children with MPS types I, II and III. Our aim was to determine the efficacy of repeated intrathecal injection of recombinant human sulfamidase (rhSGSH) on pathological changes in the MPS IIIA dog brain. The outcomes were compared with those in dogs treated via intra-cisternal or ventricular routes. Control dogs received buffer or no treatment. Significant reductions in primary/secondary substrate levels in brain were observed in dogs treated via all routes, although the extent of the reduction differed regionally. Treatment via all CSF access points resulted in large reductions in microgliosis in superficial cerebral cortex, but only ventricular injection enabled amelioration in deep cerebral cortex. Formation of glutamic acid decarboxylase-positive axonal spheroids in deep cerebellar nuclei was prevented by treatment delivered via any route. Anti-rhSGSH antibodies in the sera of some dogs did not reduce therapeutic efficacy. Our data indicates the capacity of intra-spinal CSF-injected rhSGSH to circulate within CSF-filled spaces, penetrate into brain and mediate a significant reduction in substrate accumulation and secondary pathology in the MPS IIIA dog brain.","Marshall, Neil R; Hassiotis, Sofia; King, Barbara; Rozaklis, Tina; Trim, Paul J; Duplock, Stephen K; Winner, Leanne K; Beard, Helen; Snel, Marten F; Jolly, Robert D; Hopwood, John J; Hemsley, Kim M",Experimental neurology,572,1

Intermittent pedicle clamping is an effective method to minimize blood loss during open liver surgery; however, inflow occlusion techniques are challenging to reproduce during laparoscopy. The purpose of this study is to describe the safety and efficacy of a facile method for Pringle maneuver during lapLR. METHODS 154 patients who underwent lapLR from 2007 to 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. For Pringle, the hepatoduodenal ligament is encircled with an umbilical tape which is externalized through a flexible Rumel tourniquet running alongside a port used for the operation. The internal end of the catheter is close to the pedicle and the external end is extracorporeal, allowing for easy external occlusion. Patients who underwent Pringle Maneuver (PM, n = 88) were compared to patients who had ""No Occlusion"" (NO, n = 66) with respect to patient characteristics, operative outcomes, changes in postoperative liver function, and complications. RESULTS Annual placement of the tourniquet and vascular occlusion increased from 35.7 to 82.8 % (p = 0.004) and 21.4 to 62.1 % (p = 0.02), respectively. Median occlusion time was 24 min (IQR 15-34.3, min 5, max 70). Peak transaminase levels were comparable between groups (AST 298 ± 32 vs 405 ± 47 U/L, p = 0.15; ALT 272 ± 27 vs 372 ± 34 U/L, p = 0.14, NO and PM, respectively). Postoperative transaminase and bilirubin levels for both groups were not significantly different with similar recovery to baseline. Subgroup analysis of cirrhotic patients who underwent Pringle demonstrated similar transaminase profiles compared to non-cirrhotic patients. There were two conversions (1.3 %) and postoperative 30-day mortality was 0.65 %. CONCLUSION Extracorporeal tourniquet placement in lapLR is a quick and safe method of gaining control for inflow occlusion. Routine adoption of laparoscopic Pringle maneuver facilitates low conversion rates without liver injury.","Dua, Monica M; Worhunsky, David J; Hwa, Kimberly; Poultsides, George A; Norton, Jeffrey A; Visser, Brendan C",Surgical endoscopy,572,14

A 2-year longitudinal study has been conducted to investigate the role of M. pneumoniae infections in 168 and 20 hospitalized children and adults, respectively, with asthma exacerbation compared with outpatients (88 children and 48 adults) with chronic asthma (without an exacerbation). The prevalence of Chlamydia pneumoniae and respiratory viruses was also assessed in these 2 populations. METHODS Lung function testing, blood sampling and microbiological testing (polymerase chain reaction, culture and serology) were performed for 256 children and 68 adults followed by a 7-week, follow-up visit with repeated blood sampling for serological testing and phone interviews at 6 and 12 months later. RESULTS M. pneumoniae infection was more prevalent in children with chronic asthma (13.6%) compared with children with exacerbation (7.1%), while the reverse was true in adults (6.3 vs. 10.0%, respectively). However, these differences were not statistically significant. Acute C. pneumoniae infection was identified in 3.9% of children and 7.4% adults. Children seen for chronic asthma were significantly more likely to be infected with C. pneumoniae than children hospitalized for an asthma exacerbation. Viruses were the most prevalent microorganisms detected in children with an asthma exacerbation. No differences in the outcome parameters were identified between M. pneumoniae-infected and noninfected patients.

METHODS A web-based survey was administered to U.S. otolaryngology residents. Responses to the Shirom-Melamed Burnout Measure (SMBM) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale were recorded along with data on burnout, demographics, wellness, sleep, training, and education. RESULTS 119 U.S. otolaryngology residents representing 27 of 42 states with otolaryngology residency programs responded to the survey. 24.4% (95% CI 17.0-31.8%) self-reported some level of burnout, while 10.9% met SMBM criteria for ""clinically relevant"" burnout. 51.3% experienced more stress, and 58.8% reported more anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared to males, females had a higher prevalence of burnout (38.9% vs 12.3%, P = .001) and anxiety (75.9% vs 43.8%, P < .001). PGY-2s had a greater mean SMBM index (3.64) and higher rates of self-reported burnout (54.2%) than their counterparts at other levels of training. Residents reported less time spent in the hospital, lower surgical volume, and less procedural independence. Educational didactics, primarily via videoconference, were more frequent for 63.9% of respondents. CONCLUSION While burnout among otolaryngology residents was low early in the COVID-19 pandemic, likely due to separation from the workplace environment, trainees had higher levels of anxiety and stress. The surgical experience was negatively impacted by the pandemic, but remote didactics and educational opportunities increased. These findings may inform otolaryngology residency programs on the need to promote resident wellness and aid in devising strategies to improve the educational experience during this unique global health crisis as well as in the long term.","Chou, David W; Staltari, Giuseppe; Mullen, Michael; Chang, Jolie; Durr, Megan","The Annals of otology, rhinology, and laryngology",572,17

In recent years, the incidence of mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae) infection rate has been increasing, which cause respiratory tract infection. This study sought to analyze the epidemiological characteristics of M. pneumoniae hospitalized children with RTIs to provide a theoretical basis for clinical diagnosis and treatments in Chengdu, China. Methods The data of 22,882 cases of children who had been hospitalized for RTIs were collected. M. pneumoniae immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody was detected using the indirect immunofluorescence method and passive agglutination method. The demographic features of patients, clinical diagnoses and laboratory data were also analyzed. Results A total of 4,213 children tested positive for M. pneumoniae. The total positive rate was 18.41% (18.30% for males and 22.72% for females). Female children had statistically significant higher positive rates than male children (χ2=198.078, P<0.01). The positive rates of M. pneumoniae differed significantly among children of different ages (F=162.7532, P<0.01). The incidence rate of M. pneumoniae in 2017 and 2019 was significantly higher than the average (F=538.95, P<0.01). There were higher M. pneumoniae positive rates from April to May, and September to October (P<0.05) in 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019. There was no correlation between M. pneumoniae infection and temperature and humidity (P>0.05). There was negative correlation with PM2.5 (particulate matter in the air <2.5 µm) (R=-0.293, P<0.01) and PM10 (particulate matter in the air <10 µm). (R=-0.285, P<0.01). There were significant differences in the constituent ratios of cases of M. pneumoniae infection between in 2020 and other years (F=159.35, P<0.01). Bronchopneumonia accounted for the highest proportion of cases, followed by acute bronchitis and the exacerbation of asthma in 2020. Conclusions The epidemiological distribution of M. pneumoniae in children with RTIs in Chengdu was found to be related to gender, age, year and month; however, no relationship was found to temperature and humidity. There was a higher M. pneumoniae positive rate in children with bronchial pneumonia and asthma in cases. The prevention measures used to control Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) also effectively controlled the M. pneumoniae infection rate.","Zhang, Lei; Lai, Meimei; Ai, Tao; Liao, Huiling; Huang, Yijie; Zhang, Ying; Liu, Yanru; Wang, Li; Hu, Jie",Translational pediatrics,572,9

Over 106 million COVID-19 cases including 2.3 million deaths have been reported to the WHO as of February 9, 2021. This review examines the epidemiology, transmission, clinical features, and phylogenetics of three lethal zoonotic coronavirus infections of humans: SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-COV). RECENT FINDINGS Bats appear to be the common natural source of SARS-like CoV including SARS-CoV-1 but their role in SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV remains unclear. Civet cats and dromedary camels are the intermediary animal sources for SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV infection, respectively whereas that of SARS-CoV-2 remains unclear. SARS-CoV-2 viral loads peak early on days 2-4 of symptom onset and thus high transmission occurs in the community, and asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission occurs commonly. Nosocomial outbreaks are hallmarks of SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV infections whereas these are less common in COVID-19. Several COVID-19 vaccines are now available. SUMMARY Of the three lethal zoonotic coronavirus infections of humans, SARS-CoV-2 has caused a devastating global pandemic with over a million deaths. The emergence of genetic variants, such as D614G, N501Y (variants 1 and 2), has led to an increase in transmissibility and raises concern about the possibility of re-infection and impaired vaccine response. Continued global surveillance is essential for both SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV, to monitor changing epidemiology due to viral variants.","Hui, David S; Zumla, Alimuddin; Tang, Julian W",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,572,1

OBJECTIVES To collect data about the impact of COVID-19 emergency on access to care for PwMS and on MS treatment practices. METHODS Between March and July 2020, the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) promoted an online survey covering patient access to care, management of relapses and visits, disease-modifying therapy (DMT) and experience with COVID-19. RESULTS Three-hundred and sixty neurologists from 52 countries (68% from Europe) completed the survey. 98% reported COVID-19-related restrictions. Telemedicine was adopted to overcome the limited access to care and was newly activated (73%) or widely implemented (17%). 70% reported changes in DMT management. Interferons and glatiramer were considered safe. Dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide and fingolimod were considered safe except for patients developing lymphopenia. No modifications were considered for natalizumab in 64%, cladribine in 24%, anti-CD20 in 22% and alemtuzumab in 17%; 18% (for alemtuzumab and cladribine) and 43% (for anti-CD20) considered postponing treatment.

OBJECTIVE To examine the hypothesis that a better collateral score on pretreatment CT angiography (CTA) would correlate with a smaller final infarct volume and a more favorable clinical outcome after endovascular therapy (EVT). METHODS A retrospective chart review of the University of Tennessee AIS database from February 2011 to February 2013 was conducted. All patients with CTA-proven LVO treated with EVT were included. Recanalization after EVT was defined by Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) score ≥2. Favorable outcome was assessed as a modified Rankin Score ≤3. RESULTS Fifty patients with ELVO were studied. The mean National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 17 (2-27) and 38 of the patients (76%) received intravenous tissue plasminogen activator. The recanalization rate for EVT was 86.6%. Good clinical outcome was achieved in 32% of patients. Univariate predictors of good outcome included good collateral scores (CS) on presenting CTA (p=0.043) and successful recanalization (p=0.02). Multivariate analysis confirmed both good CS (p=0.024) and successful recanalization (p=0.009) as predictors of favorable outcome. Applying results of the multivariate analysis to our cohort we were able to determine the likelihood of good clinical outcome as well as predictors of smaller final infarct volume after successful recanalization. CONCLUSIONS Good CS predict smaller infarct volumes and better clinical outcome in patients recanalized with EVT. These data support the use of this technique in selecting patients for EVT. Poor CS should be considered as an exclusion criterion for EVT as patients with poor CS have poor clinical outcomes despite recanalization.,"Elijovich, Lucas; Goyal, Nitin; Mainali, Shraddha; Hoit, Dan; Arthur, Adam S; Whitehead, Matthew; Choudhri, Asim F",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,572,6

We hypothesized that concomitant small bowel dysmotility may play a role in symptom causation in gastroparesis and sought to test this hypothesis by using wireless motility capsule (WMC) testing to simultaneously measure antral and duodenal area under pressure curve (AUC) in patients with delayed gastric emptying. METHODS Using a cohort from a multicenter clinical trial and a separate tertiary clinical database, we identified gastroparetics that underwent concurrent WMC testing and completed the Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index, a validated questionnaire. Our study included 35 gastroparetics defined by a gastric emptying time (GET) ≥ 5 h. Antral and duodenal AUC were assessed at 1-h windows pre-GET and post-GET, respectively. KEY RESULTS We found moderate correlations between duodenal AUC and symptom severity in the combined cohort (n = 35; R = -0.42; p = 0.01; 95% CI -0.7, -0.1). Removing patients with colonic delay resulted in a stronger correlation of duodenal AUC to symptom severity (n = 21; R = -0.63; p < 0.01; 95% CI -0.81, -0.31). The multicenter trial (n = 20) and clinical practice cohorts (n = 15) had significantly different symptom severity and exclusion criteria. When analyzed separately, significant correlations between duodenal AUC and symptom severity were observed (R = -0.71; p < 0.01; 95% CI -0.9, -0.4 and R = -0.72; p < 0.01; 95% CI -0.9, -0.3, respectively). Symptom severity and antral motility showed no correlation. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES We found significant correlations between duodenal AUC and symptom severity in two cohorts of gastroparetics. Small bowel motility may contribute to symptom generation in gastroparetic patients and this may inform therapeutic considerations.","Barshop, K; Staller, K; Semler, J; Kuo, B",Neurogastroenterology and motility : the official journal of the European Gastrointestinal Motility Society,572,19

Vastly different results can be obtained amongst observers which can greatly affect the resulting joint kinematics. The aim of this study is to introduce an objective method for calculating functional CS definitions for bones in joints that observe three-cylindrical-joint kinematic chain decomposition methods and to apply the method on tibiofemoral joint specimens. This method is driven by low resistance joint motion during loading profiles and not from anatomical landmark selection. Two anatomical CS definitions were established from points collected by five observers, for twelve knees. The knees underwent passive flexion and internal/external rotation using the anatomical CSs. The kinematics from these profiles were used in linear least squares minimization of off-axis motions to redefine the tibia and femur origins, the femur flexion axis and the tibia internal rotation axis. Significant improvements in reproducibility of 7.4 mm (tibia origin, p < 0.001), 3.4 mm (femur origin, p < 0.001), and 2.9° (femur FE-axis, p < 0.001) between the two functional CSs compared to the two anatomical CSs were observed. Functional CSs led to significant decreases in off-axis motion during discrete passive flexion profiles. This new strategy for establishing functional CSs provides an objective approach that will reduce the effects of observer error in establishing CSs. Additionally, functional CSs allow for better interpretations of kinematic responses due to loading because effects of kinematic cross-talk is minimized.","Nagle, Tara F; Erdemir, Ahmet; Colbrunn, Robb W",Journal of biomechanics,572,19

Combining global small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis with molecular dynamics (MD), various changes in the properties of Dioleoyl-Phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) bilayers have been determined. The solubility of quercetin in DOPC membranes is assured up to 12 mol%, whereas rutin, with additional glucose and rhamnose groups, are fully soluble only up to 6 mol%. Both flavonoids induce an increase in membrane undulations and thin the bilayers slightly (< 1 Å) in a concentration dependent manner, wherein quercetin shows a stronger effect. Concomitantly, in the order of 2-4% the adjacent bilayer distance increases with the flavonoid's concentration. Partial molecular areas of quercetin and rutin are determined to be 26 and 51 Å2, respectively. Simulated averaged areas per molecule confirm these estimates. A 60° tilted orientation of quercetin is observed with respect to the bilayer normal, whereas the flavonoid moiety of rutin is oriented more perpendicular (α-angle 30°) to the membrane surface. Both flavonoid moieties are located at a depth of 12 and 16 Å for quercetin and rutin, respectively, while their anionic forms display a location closer to the polar interface. Finally, at both simulated concentrations (1.5 and 12 mol%), DOPC/rutin systems induce a stronger packing of the pure DOPC lipid bilayer, mainly due to stronger attractive electrostatic interactions in the polar lipid head region.","Sanver, Didem; Sadeghpour, Amin; Rappolt, Michael; Di Meo, Florent; Trouillas, Patrick",Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,572,1

Nowadays, efforts in PAK4 inhibitor development are focusing on improving inhibitory selectivity, cellular potency, and in vivo pharmacokinetic properties, and identifying the feasibility of immunotherapy combination in oncology therapy.Areas covered: This review summarized the development of PAK4 inhibitors that reported on patents in the past two decades. According to their binding features, these inhibitors were classified into type I, type I 1/2, and PAMs. Their designing ideas and SAR were elucidated in this review. Moreover, synergistic therapy of PAK4 inhibitors with PD-1/PD-L1 or CAR-T were also summarized .Expert opinion: In the past years, preclinical and clinical studies of PAK4 inhibitors ended in failure due to poor selectivity, cellular activity, or pharmacokinetic issues. There are researchers questioning the reliability of PAK4 as a drug target, particularly PAK4-related therapy is concerned with the distinguishment of the non-kinase functions and catalytic functions triggered by PAK4 phosphorylation. Meanwhile, synergistic effects of PAK4 inhibitors with PD-1/PD-L1 and CAR-T immunotherapy shed light for the development of PAK4 inhibitors.","Wang, Hanxun; Song, Peilu; Gao, Yinli; Shen, Lanlan; Xu, Hanqin; Wang, Jian; Cheng, Maosheng",Expert opinion on therapeutic patents,572,1

In particular, cash transfer programmes are currently being adapted or expanded in various low-income and middle-income countries to support individuals and families during the pandemic. We argue that the current crisis offers an opportunity for these programmes to focus on susceptible young people (aged 15-24 years), including those with mental health conditions. Young people living in poverty and with mental health problems are at particular risk of experiencing adverse health, wellbeing, and employment outcomes with long-term consequences. They are also at risk of developing mental health conditions during this pandemic. To support this population, cash transfer programmes should not only address urgent needs around food security and survival but expand their focus to address longer-term mental health impacts of pandemics and economic crises. Such an approach could help support young people's future life chances and break the vicious cycle between mental illness and poverty that spirals many young people into both socioeconomic and mental health disadvantage.","Bauer, Annette; Garman, Emily; McDaid, David; Avendano, Mauricio; Hessel, Philipp; Díaz, Yadira; Araya, Ricardo; Lund, Crick; Malvasi, Paulo; Matijasevich, Alicia; Park, A-La; Paula, Cristiane Silvestre; Ziebold, Carolina; Zimmerman, Annie; Evans-Lacko, Sara",The lancet.

Although appealing, the associated cost and complex learning curve limit TEM utilization by colorectal surgeons. Single-port laparoscopic principles are being recognized as transferable to transanal work and hybrid techniques are in evolution. Here the clinical application of a new technique for transanal access is reported. METHODS Consecutive non-selected patients eligible for TEM over a 3-month period (and selected patients thereafter) were offered a procedure performed via a 'glove TEM port'. This access device was constructed on-table using a circular anal dilator (CAD), wound retractor and standard surgical glove, along with standard, straight laparoscopic trocar sleeves and instruments. RESULTS Fourteen patients underwent full-thickness resection of benign (8) or malignant (6) rectal pathology. CAD insertion failed in one patient and conventional TEM assistance was needed in another, leaving 12 procedures completed successfully by glove TEM alone as planned (completion rate 86 per cent overall, 92 per cent after initiation). The median (range) duration of operation and resected specimen area were 93 (30-120) min and 12 (3-152) cm(2) respectively. There was no intraoperative and minimal postoperative morbidity, with a median follow-up of 5.7 (2.7-9.4) months. CONCLUSION The glove TEM port is a safe, inexpensive and readily available access tool that may obviate the use of specialized equipment for transanal resection of rectal lesions.","Hompes, R; Ris, F; Cunningham, C; Mortensen, N J; Cahill, R A",The British journal of surgery,572,9

The facility was designed as an acute care medical unit capable of supporting COVID-19 patients who were stable enough to be released from the intensive care unit but not ready for discharge home. Safety was optimized through the application of recommendations from the Joint Commission and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The safety goals include those established by the Joint Commission with regard to patient identification, security, identification of patient safety threats, communication, fire safety, laboratory services, and pharmacologic services. COVID-19-specific goals outlined by the CDC also are addressed and include recommendations for facility layout, managing staff respite and personal protective equipment, patient care areas, supply storage, airflow, and patient hygiene. Although the goal was to meet all of these recommendations, some were not possible due to the austere environment of the arena. However, these shortcomings were met with innovative solutions that provided the next best options.

AIM The aim of this survey was to evaluate changes in eating habits and other lifestyle behaviours (i.e., exercise and smoking) of people of almost all ages, who live in Greece, during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS A web-based survey using conventional sampling was conducted from during December 2020, in Greece. A total of 2258 individuals, aged 17 years and older voluntarily participated (912 (40%) men). RESULTS 89 (3.94%) of the participants reported that they had, or currently have been diagnosed with COVID-19. Moreover, 36.4% of the participants reported that they have changed their dietary habits during the pandemic towards a healthier diet - those participants had median age of 35 years, were of both sexes, 17% had co-morbidities and 69% with higher education level; moreover, 19% of those participants have started or increased the frequency of receiving dietary supplements that enhance the immune system, 34% of the participants reported that they gained weight during the pandemic period, whereas 19.8% reported that they have lost weight, and 37% of the participants reported that they have started or increased, as compared to the pre-pandemic time, their frequency of physical activities.

Vaccine hesitancy has increased during recent years, and more research is needed on its situational determinants. This paper reports a preregistered experiment (N = 654) that examined whether communicating descriptive social norms - information about what most people do - is an effective way of influencing young people's intentions and reducing their hesitancy to take the COVID-19 vaccine. We found weak support for our main hypothesis that conveying strong (compared to weak) norms leads to reduced hesitancy and stronger intentions. Furthermore, norms did not produce significantly different effects compared to standard vaccine information from the authorities. Moreover, no support was found for the hypothesis that young people are more strongly influenced by norms when the norm reference group consists of other young individuals rather than people in general. These findings suggest that the practical usefulness of signaling descriptive norms is rather limited, and may not be more effective than standard appeals in the quest of encouraging young adults to trust and accept a new vaccine.","Sinclair, Samantha; Agerström, Jens",Health communication,572,27

However, there is not much information available on the toxicity of nanoparticles in neuronal disorders. The toxic effect of nanoparticles on brain disorders and their regulatory issues is the primary concern of the healthcare industry. METHODS A strategical literature search was performed on a various bibliographic database such as Scopus, PubMed, SciFinder, Google Scholar, Medline, Google patent, Derwent Innovation, and Orbit Intelligence for retrieval of peerreviewed articles and patents on regulatory issues and toxicity of nanoparticles in neuronal disorders over the past four decades or so. The relevant hits of articles and patents were analyzed and citation search for the relevant documents was carried out. RESULTS The literature documents have been summarized regarding the existing regulatory issues and toxicity of nanoparticles on neuronal disorders with a focus on the detailed mechanism of developmental toxicity of nanoparticles. The focus of this report is to emphasize the negative effects of nanoparticle on neuronal disorders which may partially contribute to management of toxicity of nanoparticles. CONCLUSION Although nanoparticles have unique physical and chemical properties that explain the broad range of application for the central nervous system, they can also manifest neurotoxic effects due to cell necrosis, a generation of free radicals, immune responses and neuroinflammation. Thus, this review highlights on risk assessment, safety regulations and regulatory guidelines of nanoparticles which may reduce adverse reactions in humans and animals.","Muheem, Abdul; Jahangir, Mohammed Asadullah; Jaiswal, Chandra Prakash; Jafar, Mohammed; Ahmad, Mohammad Zaki; Ahmad, Javed; Warsi, Musarrat Husain",Current drug metabolism,572,1

EY6A Fab binds the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike glycoprotein tightly (KD of 2 nM), and a 2.6-Å-resolution crystal structure of an RBD-EY6A Fab complex identifies the highly conserved epitope, away from the ACE2 receptor binding site. Residues within this footprint are key to stabilizing the pre-fusion spike.

Cystoceles occur secondary to defect(s) in one or more of the vaginal wall support mechanisms, including its lateral paravaginal attachments. Paravaginal defects are very common in women presenting with cystocele, thus highlighting the importance of paravaginal defect repair for optimal cystocele correction in the majority of cases. Although there are several paravaginal defect repair procedures, some entail complex techniques, whereas others rely on the use of transvaginal mesh, which is currently not permitted in many countries. METHODS In this video article we present a novel trans-obturator native tissue paravaginal defect repair for the management of cystocele. RESULTS This procedure has the advantages of avoiding complex transabdominal paravaginal defect repair, the controversial use of transvaginal mesh, or a single-point fixation to an arcus tendineus fasciae pelvis that might be difficult to identify. CONCLUSION We believe that the trans-obturator cystocele repair procedure offers several advantages over existing paravaginal defect repair alternatives.","Kalis, Vladimir; Kovarova, Veronika; Rusavy, Zdenek; Ismail, Khaled M",International urogynecology journal,572,23

Most COVID-19-Pregnancy patients showed mild to moderate COVID-19 pneumonia with no pregnancy loss and no congenital transmission of the virus; however, an increase in hypoxia-induced preterm deliveries was apparent. Also, the breastmilk of several mothers with COVID-19 tested negative for the virus. Taken together, the natural barrier function during pregnancy and postpartum seems to deter the SARS-CoV-2 transmission from mother-to-child. This clinical observation warrants to explore the maternal-fetal interface and identify the innate defense factors for prevention and control of COVID-19-Pregnancy. Lactoferrin (LF) is a potent antiviral iron-binding protein present in the maternal-fetal interface. In concert with immune co-factors, maternal-LF modulates chemokine release and lymphocyte migration and amplify host defense during pregnancy. LF levels during pregnancy may resolve hypertension via down-regulation of ACE2; consequently, may limit the membrane receptor access to SARS-CoV-2 for cellular entry. Furthermore, an LF-derived peptide (LRPVAA) has been shown to block ACE receptor activity in vitro. LF may also reduce viral docking and entry into host cells and limit the early phase of COVID-19 infection. An in-depth understanding of LF and other soluble mammalian milk-derived innate antiviral factors may provide insights to reduce co-morbidities and vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection and may lead to the development of effective nutraceutical supplements.","Naidu, Sreus A G; Clemens, Roger A; Pressman, Peter; Zaigham, Mehreen; Davies, Kelvin J A; Naidu, A Satyanarayan",Journal of dietary supplements,572,1

Inclusion criteria will be broad with respect to type of work, as we will include all types of research studies as well as non-research studies that provide information relevant to characteristics and constructs measured in the context of integrated care for youth mental health. Titles and abstracts will be independently screened for eligibility by two raters using inclusion criteria. Full-text articles will then be accessed and independently screened for inclusion. A formal data extraction method will be employed, enabling synthesis of results in quantitative and qualitative formats. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Results will be widely disseminated to various stakeholders to inform implementation and research efforts. Findings will also launch a Delphi method study leading to the development of an assessment tool for youth mental health services integration. This review does not require ethics approval.","Settipani, Cara A; Cleverley, Kristin; Hawke, Lisa D; Rice, Maureen; Henderson, Joanna L",BMJ open,572,24

Due to its rarity, treatment is still directed by data mainly extrapolated from female breast cancer (FBC) treatment, despite the fact that it has recently become clear that MBC has its own molecular characteristics. DDX3 is a RNA helicase with tumor suppressor and oncogenic potential that was described as a prognosticator in FBC and can be targeted by small molecule inhibitors of DDX3. The aim of this study was to evaluate if DDX3 is a useful prognosticator for MBC patients. Nuclear as well as cytoplasmic DDX3 expression was studied by immunohistochemistry in a Dutch retrospective cohort of 106 MBC patients. Differences in 10-year survival by DDX3 expression were analyzed using log-rank test. The association between clinicopathologic variables, DDX3 expression, and survival was tested in uni- and multivariate Cox-regression analysis. High cytoplasmic DDX3 was associated with high androgen receptor (AR) expression while low nuclear DDX3 was associated with negative lymph node status. Nuclear and cytoplasmic DDX3 were not associated with each other. In a univariate analysis, high cytoplasmic DDX3 (p = 0.045) was significantly associated with better 10-year overall survival. In multivariate analyses, cytoplasmic DDX3 had independent prognostic value (p = 0.017). In conclusion, cytoplasmic DDX3 expression seems to be a useful prognosticator in MBC, as high cytoplasmic DDX3 indicated better 10-year survival.","van der Pol, Carmen C; Moelans, Cathy B; Manson, Quirine F; Batenburg, Marilot C T; van der Wall, Elsken; Borel Rinkes, Inne; Verkooijen, Lenny; Raman, Venu; van Diest, Paul J",Virchows Archiv : an international journal of pathology,572,1

This review maps evidence on the effects and effectiveness of soft robotic gloves for hand rehabilitation and, whenever possible, patients' satisfaction. A systematized search of the literature was conducted using keywords structured around three areas: technology attributes, anatomy, and rehabilitation. A total of 272 titles, abstracts, and keywords were initially retrieved, and data were extracted out of 13 articles. Six articles investigated the effects of wearing a soft robotic glove and eight studied the effect or effectiveness of an intervention with it. Some statistically significant and meaningful beneficial effects were confirmed with the 29 outcome measures used. Finally, 11 articles also confirmed users' satisfaction with regard to the soft robotic glove, while some articles also noticed an increased engagement in the rehabilitation program with this technology. Despite the heterogeneity across studies, soft robotic gloves stand out as a safe and promising technology to improve hand- and finger-related dexterity and functional performance.

Besides the kidneys, the bone marrow is a potentially dose-limiting organ. The radiation dose to the bone marrow is usually calculated according to the MIRD scheme, where the accumulated activity in the bone marrow is calculated from the accumulated radioactivity of the radiopharmaceutical in the blood. This may underestimate the absorbed dose since stem cells express somatostatin receptors. We verified the blood-based method by comparing the activity in the blood with the radioactivity in bone marrow aspirates. Also, we evaluated the absorbed cross-dose from the source organs (liver, spleen, kidneys and blood), tumours and the so-called ""remainder of the body"" to the bone marrow. METHODS Bone marrow aspirates were drawn in 15 patients after treatment with [(177)Lu-DOTA(0),Tyr(3)]octreotate. Radioactivity in the bone marrow was compared with radioactivity in the blood drawn simultaneously. The nucleated cell fraction was isolated from the bone marrow aspirate and radioactivity was measured. The absorbed dose to the bone marrow was calculated. The results were correlated to the change in platelet counts 6 weeks after treatment. RESULTS A strong linear correlation and high agreement between the measured radioactivities in the bone marrow aspirates and in the blood was found (r=0.914, p<0.001). No correlation between the calculated absorbed dose in the bone marrow and the change in platelets was found. There was a considerable contribution from other organs and the remainder of the body to the bone marrow absorbed dose. CONCLUSION (1) After PRRT with [(177)Lu-DOTA(0),Tyr(3)]octreotate, the radioactivity concentration in the bone marrow is identical to that in the blood; (2) There is no significant binding of the radiopharmaceutical to bone marrow precursor stem cells; (3) The contribution of the cross dose from source organs and tumours to the bone marrow dose is significant; and (4) There is considerable variation in bone marrow absorbed dose between patients. These findings imply that for individual dose optimization, individual calculation of the bone marrow absorbed dose is necessary.","Forrer, Flavio; Krenning, Eric P; Kooij, Peter P; Bernard, Bert F; Konijnenberg, Mark; Bakker, Willem H; Teunissen, Jaap J M; de Jong, Marion; van Lom, Kirsten; de Herder, Wouter W; Kwekkeboom, Dik J",European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,572,4

Calcification is sometimes observed in thymomas using computed tomography (CT), and it is more frequent in invasive thymomas than in noninvasive thymomas. However, the significance of calcification in thymomas remains unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the significance of calcification in thymomas on invasiveness to surrounding organs and investigate the characteristics of thymoma cases with calcification at our institution. METHODS We included thymoma patients treated at our institution between 2000 and 2016, and evaluated their characteristics, including demographics, calcification on CT, histology, Masaoka stage, and myasthenia gravis status. The patients were categorized into calcification (C) and noncalcification (NC) groups. RESULTS Among 51 included patients, 11 (21.6%) had calcification. A higher proportion of group C patients had World Health Organization histological type B2 and B3 tumors (high-risk) than type A, AB, and B1 tumors (low-risk; p = 0.0477). The number of patients with Masaoka stages III and IV were significantly higher in the C group than in the NC group (p < 0.0001). The C group patients had significantly higher rates of invasion to the mediastinal pleura, pericardium, lung, phrenic nerve, and chest wall and pleural dissemination than the NC group patients. CONCLUSIONS Calcification reflects invasiveness of tumors to surrounding organs and tissues, and may thus predict thymoma stage and histologically high-risk thymomas. Calcification in thymomas may also predict the pathological stage and help decide therapeutic methods and surgical approaches to treat thymomas based on the calcification status according to CT findings.","Yoshida, Mitsuteru; Kondo, Kazuya; Miyamoto, Naoki; Kawakami, Yukikiyo; Tangoku, Akira",Thoracic cancer,572,17

CoV-X2 simultaneously binds two independent sites on the RBD and, unlike its parental antibodies, prevents detectable S binding to Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), the virus cellular receptor. Furthermore, CoV-X2 neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 and its variants of concern, as well as the escape mutants generated by the parental monoclonals. In a novel animal model of SARS-CoV-2 infection with lung inflammation, CoV-X2 protects mice from disease and suppresses viral escape. Thus, simultaneous targeting of non-overlapping RBD epitopes by IgG-like bispecific antibodies is feasible and effective, combining into a single molecule the advantages of antibody cocktails.","De Gasparo, Raoul; Pedotti, Mattia; Simonelli, Luca; Nickl, Petr; Muecksch, Frauke; Cassaniti, Irene; Percivalle, Elena; Lorenzi, Julio C C; Mazzola, Federica; Magrì, Davide; Michalcikova, Tereza; Haviernik, Jan; Honig, Vaclav; Mrazkova, Blanka; Polakova, Natalie; Fortova, Andrea; Tureckova, Jolana; Iatsiuk, Veronika; Di Girolamo, Salvatore; Palus, Martin; Zudova, Dagmar; Bednar, Petr; Bukova, Ivana; Bianchini, Filippo; Mehn, Dora; Nencka, Radim; Strakova, Petra; Pavlis, Oto; Rozman, Jan; Gioria, Sabrina; Sammartino, Josè Camilla; Giardina, Federica; Gaiarsa, Stefano; Pan-Hammarström, Qiang; Barnes, Christopher O; Bjorkman, Pamela J; Calzolai, Luigi; Piralla, Antonio; Baldanti, Fausto; Nussenzweig, Michel C; Bieniasz, Paul D; Hatziioannou, Theodora; Prochazka, Jan; Sedlacek, Radislav; Robbiani, Davide F; Ruzek, Daniel; Varani, Luca",Nature,572,12

SUMMARY ANSWER Adult offspring's receipt of identifying information about the sperm donor challenged the fathers' role as a parent, which was reflected in how parents positioned the donor in relation to the family. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY An increasing number of countries provide access to treatment with identity-release or 'open-identity' donors. However, there is limited knowledge about how parents experience and manage the situation when adult offspring obtain identifying information about the donor and may even establish contact with him. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION This qualitative interview study included 23 parents whose offspring had obtained information about their sperm donor. Interviews were conducted from October 2018 to January 2019. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS A purposive sample of parents (15 mothers and 8 fathers) was recruited via adult offspring, who had requested identifying donor information at five Swedish University hospitals. All participating parents were part of a heterosexual couple who had conceived with sperm from an identity-release donor. Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted face-to face or via telephone, and transcribed audio recordings were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE The parents expressed diverse experiences related to their parenthood and the presence of the donor after offspring had obtained information about him; these were described in two themes. The theme 'Navigating (in)visible markers of parenthood' describes parenthood as embedded with dichotomous meanings of nature and nurture that parents navigated in relation to social approval. The theme 'Positioning the donor in a new landscape' describes how parents managed the presence of the donor by positioning him at a distance or acknowledging him as a person or even as part of the family, while some struggled to position him, giving rise to ambivalent feelings. The absence of genetic connectedness challenged the father's role as parent, which was reflected in parents' positioning of the donor. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION The study was performed within the context of the Swedish legislation on identity-release donation and is based on experiences of heterosexual couples who had used sperm donation and had informed their offspring about their donor conception. This, together with the fact that parents' accounts were predominantly represented by mothers, must be taken into consideration regarding transferability to other populations. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS Negotiations of social and genetic parenthood are still present among parents many years after treatment and may resurface when adult offspring obtain the donor's identity. Access of the adult offspring to identifying information about the donor may have unexpected consequences for family relations, including expanding the family to include the donor. Challenges related to male infertility and family dynamics indicate that parents should have access to counseling and support to manage family life with varying genetic linkage within and outside the family unit.

Our study included all confirmed cases, from March 8 until April 28, 2020, collected from the official website that reports the situation of COVID-19 infections in Brazil. The Boltzmann function was applied to a data simulation for each set of data regarding different states. The model data were well fitted, with R2 values close to 0.999. Up to April 28, 20,665 cases were confirmed in the region. The state of Ceará has the highest rate of accumulated cases per 100,000 inhabitants (75.75), followed by Pernambuco. We estimated that the states of Ceará, Sergipe and Paraíba will experience a dramatic increase in the rate of cumulative cases until July 31. Maranhão, Pernambuco, Rio Grande do Norte and Piauí showed a more discreet increase in the model. For Bahia and Alagoas, a 4.7 and 6.6-fold increase in the rate was estimated, respectively. We estimate a substantial increase in the rate of cumulative cases per 100,000 inhabitants in the region within three months, especially for Ceará, Sergipe and Paraíba. The Boltzmann function proved to be a simple tool for epidemiological forecasting that can help planning the measures to contain COVID-19.","Melo, Géssyca Cavalcante de; Araújo Neto, Renato Américo de; Araújo, Karina Conceição Gomes Machado de",Cadernos de saude publica,572,20

Hence, HCV must have acquired the ability to gain access to key pathways controlling processes, such as cell growth, apoptosis and protein synthesis, which are all considered to also be crucial for liver regeneration. This occurs in a balanced way permitting persistent replication of viral genomes and production of infectious particles without endangering host cell viability and survival. In particular during the last decade, accumulating evidence indicates that HCV utilizes signaling pathways of the host with major impact on cellular growth, viability, cell cycle or cellular metabolism, such as epidermal growth factor-receptor mediated signals, the PI3K/Akt cascade or the family of Src kinases. Furthermore, HCV specifically interacts with parts of the cellular machinery involved in protein translation, processing, maturation and transport, such as components of the translation complex, the heat shock protein family, the immunophilins or the vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated proteins A and B.

Recent studies have highlighted the contribution of caregivers to sleep development. However, the majority of them have primarily focused on maternal behaviors, overlooking fathers. The main goal of the present study was to investigate the associations between paternal and maternal involvement in children's sleep care and the number of night awakenings reported by both parents in infants and toddlers. METHODS One-hundred-and-one families of infants aged 8 to 12 months and 54 families of toddlers aged 18 to 36 months filled out the following self-report questionnaires: The Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire and an ad hoc questionnaire to assess parental involvement in sleep care for children. A moderate actor-partner interdependence (APIM) with path analysis was performed to test the predictive role of parental involvement on the children's sleep (no. of nocturnal awakenings) and the moderation role of age on these relationships. RESULTS Paternal involvement in children's sleep care was associated with the number of night awakenings reported by both parents. Moreover, a significant interaction effect emerged between the children's age and paternal involvement in children's sleep care for predicting nocturnal awakenings.

RESULTS A total of 637 patients received intravenous thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke in our center during an 8·3-year period. Thirty-three (5·2%) were found to have at least one intracranial aneurysms. Twenty-three (70%) of those received only intravenous thrombolysis, and 10 patients received combination of intravenous and intra-arterial thrombolysis. The size of the largest aneurysm was 10 mm in maximum diameter (range: 2-10 mm). The mean size of aneurysms was 4·8 mm. No symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage occurred among the 23 patients receiving only intravenous thrombolysis. Out of those who received a combination of intravenous and intra-arterial thrombolysis, one developed symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage in the location of acute infarct, distant to the aneurysm location. CONCLUSION Our findings suggest that neither intravenous thrombolysis nor combination of intravenous and intra-arterial thrombolysis increases the risk of aneurysmal hemorrhage in acute ischemic stroke patients who harbor unruptured intracranial aneurysms less than 10 mm in diameter. Their listing in exclusion criteria for intravenous thrombolysis should be reconsidered to assure appropriate use of acute reperfusion therapy in this group of patients.","Mowla, Ashkan; Singh, Karanbir; Mehla, Sandhya; Ahmed, Mohammad K; Shirani, Peyman; Kamal, Haris; Krishna, Chandan; Sawyer, Robert N; Ching, Marilou; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Levy, Elad I; Snyder, Kenneth V; Crumlish, Annemarie; Hopkins, L N",International journal of stroke : official journal of the International Stroke Society,572,1

This suggests an interplay between immunogenetic susceptibility, immune dysregulation, bacterial infection, and lung damage. The damaged epithelium impairs mucus removal and facilitates bacterial infection with increased cough, sputum production, and airflow obstruction. Lung infection is caused by respiratory bacterial and fungal pathogens, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus, Aspergillus fumigatus, and nontuberculous mycobacteria. Recent studies have highlighted the relationship between the lung microbiota and microbial-pathogen niches. Disease may result from environments favoring interleukin-17-driven neutrophilia. Bronchiectasis may present in autoimmune disease, as well as conditions of immune dysregulation, such as combined variable immune deficiency, transporter associated with antigen processing-deficiency syndrome, and hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome.

Specifically, given a dataset of empirical measures, the likelihood of the first digit of any number being 1 is ∼30 %, ∼18 % for 2, 12.5 % for 3 and so on, with a decreasing probability all the way to number 9. If the digits were distributed uniformly, all the numbers 1 through 9 would have the same probability to appear as the first digit in any given empirical random measurement.

Early detection of cerebral palsy allows for the implementation of early intervention and is associated with better functional outcomes. No review to date has summarized the utility of the General Movements Assessment to predict cerebral palsy in term and late-preterm infants diagnosed with neonatal encephalopathy. METHODS We conducted a scoping review involving infants born greater than or equal to 34 weeks gestational age to identify all available evidence and delineate research gaps. We extracted data on sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values and described the strengths and limitations of the results. We searched five databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsychINFO, Scopus, and CINAHL) and the General Movements Trust website. Two reviewers conducted all screening and data extraction independently. The articles were categorized according to key findings, and a critical appraisal was performed. RESULTS Only three studies, a cohort and two case series, met all of the inclusion criteria. The total number of participants was 118. None of the final eligible studies included late-preterm neonates. All three studies reported on sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive and negative predictive values. An abnormal General Movement Assessment at 3-5 months has a high specificity (84.6-98%) for cerebral palsy with a similarly high negative predictive value (84.6-98%) when it was normal. Absent fidgety movements, in particular, are highly specific (96%) for moderate to severe cerebral palsy and carry a high negative predictive value (98%) when normal. In the time period between term and 4-5 months post-term, any cramped synchronized movements had results of 100% sensitivity and variable results for specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. CONCLUSIONS A normal General Movements Assessment at 3 months in a term high-risk infant is likely associated with a low risk for moderate/severe cerebral palsy. The finding of cramped synchronized General Movements is a strong predictor for the diagnosis of cerebral palsy by 2 years of age in the term population with neonatal encephalopathy. The deficit of high-quality research limits the applicability, and so the General Movements Assessment should not be used in isolation when assessing this population.

A plethora of pathogens including viruses, bacteria, parasites, and fungi are recognized by DC-SIGN through both mannose and fucose-containing glycans expressed on the pathogen surface. In this study, we identified semen clusterin as a novel DC-SIGN ligand. Semen clusterin, but not serum clusterin, expresses an extreme abundance of fucose-containing blood-type Ags such as Le(x) and Le(y), which are both excellent DC-SIGN ligands. These motifs enable semen clusterin to bind DC-SIGN with very high affinity (K(d) 76 nM) and abrogate the binding of HIV-1 to DC-SIGN. Depletion of clusterin from semen samples, however, did not completely prevent the ability of semen to inhibit the capture of HIV-1 by DC-SIGN, supporting that besides clusterin, semen contains other DC-SIGN ligands. Further studies are needed to characterize these ligands and define their contribution to the DC-SIGN-blocking activity mediated by semen. Clusterin is an enigmatic protein involved in a variety of physiologic and pathologic processes including inflammation, atherosclerosis, and cancer. Our results uncover an unexpected heterogeneity in the glycosylation pattern of clusterin and suggest that the expression of high concentrations of fucose-containing glycans enables semen clusterin to display a unique set of biological functions that might affect the early course of sexually transmitted infectious diseases.","Sabatte, Juan; Faigle, Wolfgang; Ceballos, Ana; Morelle, Willy; Rodríguez Rodrígues, Christian; Remes Lenicov, Federico; Thépaut, Michel; Fieschi, Franck; Malchiodi, Emilio; Fernández, Marisa; Arenzana-Seisdedos, Fernando; Lortat-Jacob, Hugues; Michalski, Jean-Claude; Geffner, Jorge; Amigorena, Sebastian",Journal of immunology,572,1

Early identification of developmental delay using validated screening instruments provides a pathway to prevention and intervention in pediatric health care settings. However, the validity of Spanish-language screening instruments, used in clinical settings in the United States, has not been systematically examined. OBJECTIVE This study aims to review the literature of clinically administered developmental and behavioral instruments with Hispanic caregivers to investigate implementation variation due to language and cultural factors. METHODS A systematic literature review using PubMed and PsycINFO was conducted of articles published from January 1, 2006 to December 12, 2017. Abstract, full-text, and critical appraisal resulted in 11 studies that met criteria for inclusion. RESULTS Five different instruments were used to screen Hispanic or Spanish-speaking caregivers of children younger than 6 years. None of the instruments established validity and reliability apart from Spanish translation. Two studies identified differences in screening results with Spanish-speaking caregivers due to language and 6 described cultural differences that impacted screening implementation. Two studies reported differential item functioning in Spanish-translated instruments. CONCLUSIONS Language and cultural considerations are critical to the administration of valid and reliable screening in pediatric health care settings. Available developmental and behavioral Spanish-language-screening instruments function differently because of both language and culture, suggesting the tools are not as psychometrically valid when administered to Spanish-speaking families. Validation of translated screening instruments is essential to eliminate the possibility of detection bias or misidentification of developmental risk, improving early access to clinical services for Hispanic and Spanish-speaking families.","Bevan, Stacey L; Liu, Jianghong; Wallis, Kate E; Pinto-Martin, Jennifer A",Journal of developmental and behavioral pediatrics : JDBP,572,1

The presence of six bacterial species: S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and N. meningitidis in addition to respiratory syncytial virus, influenza viruses A and B, rhinovirus/enterovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza viruses 1-3 and adenovirus was determined using culture and PCR methods.Results/Key findings. Carriage was shown to vary with age, recent RTI and the presence of other species. Spatial structures of microbial communities were more disordered in the 0-4 age group and those with recent RTI. Species frequency distributions were flatter than random expectation in young individuals (X2=20.42, P=0.002), indicating spatial clumping of species consistent with facilitative relationships. Deviations from a neutral model of ecological niches were observed in summer samples and from older individuals but not in the winter or younger individuals (0-4 years), suggesting the presence of seasonal and age-dependent niche processes in respiratory community assembly.

OBJECTIVES The study was designed to investigate the influence of a left-to-right shunt via the ductus arteriosus (DA) on regional oxygen saturation (rSO2) of the brain and peripheral tissue during postnatal transition. METHODS Nested case-control study. In term neonates after elective cesarian section, rSO2 of the brain and pre- and postductal peripheral tissue were measured 15 min after uncomplicated postnatal transition. Two groups were formed according to shunt flow characteristics via the DA: shunt group (with a left-to-right shunt), and nonshunt group (no shunt). RESULTS Of 80 infants, in 58 (72%) a left-to-right shunt was identified, and in 22 (28%) no flow was seen via the DA. The 22 infants formed the nonshunt group. They were matched with 22 newborn infants with a left-to-right shunt via the DA (shunt group). Infants in the nonshunt group had significantly lower cerebral rSO2 values and higher fractional tissue oxygen extraction and heart rate values. There were no significant differences in regard to peripheral rSO2 values. CONCLUSION During postnatal transition, term infants with a left-to-right shunt via the DA have significantly higher cerebral rSO2 values compared to infants without shunt flow.","Urlesberger, Berndt; Brandner, Anna; Pocivalnik, Mirjam; Koestenberger, Martin; Morris, Nicholas; Pichler, Gerhard",Neonatology,572,12

Both methylprednisolone (MP) and repository corticotropin injection (HP Acthar(®) gel) have demonstrated efficacy in reducing short-term disability after exacerbations of MS. Although historical data are limited, repository corticotropin injection has not generally been associated with detrimental neuropsychiatric effects. We describe six cases of patients with relapsing-remitting MS who had previously experienced detrimental mood changes with MP treatment. Some of these patients had previous histories of mood disorders or other neuropsychiatric symptoms prior to MS diagnosis. All six patients were subsequently treated with repository corticotropin injection for MS exacerbations and each demonstrated improvements in MS symptoms. This clinical experience suggests that repository corticotropin injection should be considered as an alternative for patients who do not tolerate corticosteroids or have difficulties associated with intravenous medication. Furthermore, the rate of neuropsychiatric side effects observed in these patients was low. These observations support repository corticotropin injection as a viable alternative for the treatment of acute exacerbations of MS, particularly in patients who have a history of neuropsychiatric disorders or symptoms either independently or in response to MP treatment. In reviewing both the published data and our own clinical experience regarding potential neuropsychiatric adverse events with treatment for MS exacerbations, we hope to stimulate further research into the potential efficacy and safety of repository corticotropin injection among patients with some form of neuropsychiatric complications that must be considered when establishing a treatment plan for MS.","Murray, Stacey; Woo, Andrew",Therapeutic advances in neurological disorders,572,1

Hence, in the current study, selected PhACs, heavy metals (HMs), and physicochemical parameters (PCPs) were measured from the surface waters of the River Cauvery during the pre- and post-monsoon. PhACs such as caffeine, carbamazepine, and diclofenac were detected in most samples, whereas topiramate, ibuprofen, and verapamil were found only in few stations. In contrast, the distribution of ciprofloxacin, atenolol, and isoprenaline was strongly influenced by the seasonal pattern (p < 0.05). PhACs such as loperamide, glafenine, erythromycin, and gemfibrozil were not detected during the study.

Given China's history of regionalism, we theorize and use a survey experiment to empirically assess region-based stigma: People who lived in Hubei (the hardest hit province) during the outbreak and those who were socially associated with Hubei were stigmatized. Furthermore, the COVID-19 outbreak created stigma around people labeled as patients by the state. These stigmatized groups reported greater perceived discrimination, which-as a stressor-led to psychological distress. Our interview data illuminated how the stigmatized groups perceived, experienced, and coped with discrimination and stigma.","Fan, Wen; Qian, Yue; Jin, Yongai",Journal of health and social behavior,572,19

In most low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) the daily calcium intake is well below recommendations. Mapping calcium intake during pregnancy worldwide and identifying populations with low calcium intake will provide the evidence base for more targeted actions to improve calcium intake. OBJECTIVE To assess dietary calcium intake during pregnancy worldwide. SEARCH STRATEGY MEDLINE and EMBASE (from July 2004 to November 2017). SELECTION CRITERIA Cross-sectional, cohort, and intervention studies reporting calcium intake during pregnancy. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Five reviewers working in pairs independently performed screening, extraction, and quality assessment. We reported summary measures of calcium intake and calculated the weighted arithmetic mean for high-income countries (HICs) and LMICs independently, and for geographic regions, among studies reporting country of recruitment, mean intake, and total number of participants. When available, inadequate intakes were reported. MAIN RESULTS From 1880 citations 105 works met the inclusion criteria, providing data for 73 958 women in 37 countries. The mean calcium intake was 948.3 mg/day (95% CI 872.1-1024.4 mg/day) for HICs and 647.6 mg/day (95% CI 568.7-726.5 mg/day) for LMICs. Calcium intakes below 800 mg/day were reported in five (29%) countries from HICs and in 14 (82%) countries from LMICs. CONCLUSION These results are consistent with a lack of improvement in calcium dietary intake during pregnancy and confirm the gap between HICs and LMICs, with alarmingly low intakes recorded for pregnant women in LMICs. From the public health perspective, in the absence of specific local data, calcium supplementation of pregnant women in these countries should be universal. TWEETABLE ABSTRACT Despite dietary recommendations, women in LMICs face pregnancy with diets low in calcium.","Cormick, G; Betrán, A P; Romero, I B; Lombardo, C F; Gülmezoglu, A M; Ciapponi, A; Belizán, J M",BJOG : an international journal of obstetrics and gynaecology,572,1

In this study we exploit their use as a tool for predicting the risk of rupture of aneurysms with a defined Rupture Resemblance Score (RRS). METHODS We collected three-dimensional images of 85 consecutive aneurysms, applied the three regression models and compared model performance at predicting rupture status against anecdotal metrics (aneurysm size and aspect ratio). We then reinterpreted the model-predicted probability as RRS, where the higher the score the closer the resemblance to previously known rupture components, and applied the RRS prospectively to four unruptured aneurysms with borderline treatment decisions. RESULTS All three models yielded excellent sensitivity (0.78-0.83) and specificity (0.78-0.84) at a cutoff score of 50%, whereas aneurysm size and aspect ratio showed poor sensitivities (0.28 and 0.33, respectively). Lowering the cutoff score to 30% improved sensitivity to 0.90. The RRS identified most of the ruptured aneurysms and also some unruptured ones that closely resembled ruptured aneurysms hemodynamically and/or morphologically. The prospective application of the RRS to unruptured aneurysms shows that it could provide additional insights for treatment decisions. CONCLUSIONS Previous regression models based on hemodynamic-morphological parameters are able to discriminate rupture in a new cohort in the same population. A higher probability of rupture is associated with larger size ratio, lower normalized wall shear stress and higher oscillatory shear index. The RRS could potentially stratify rupture risk and assist in treatment decision-making for unruptured aneurysms.","Xiang, Jianping; Yu, Jihnhee; Choi, Hoon; Dolan Fox, Jennifer M; Snyder, Kenneth V; Levy, Elad I; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Meng, Hui",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,572,7

This review of human α-defensins begins by describing their evolution, including their likely relationship to the Big Defensins of invertebrates, and their kinship to the β-defensin peptides of many if not all vertebrates, and the θ-defensins found in certain non-human primates. We provide a short history of the search for leukocyte-derived microbicidal molecules, emphasizing the roles played by luck (good), preconceived notions (mostly bad), and proper timing (essential). The antimicrobial, antiviral, antitoxic, and binding properties of human α-defensins are summarized. The structural features of α-defensins are described extensively and their functional contributions are assessed. The properties of HD6, an enigmatic Paneth cell α-defensin, are contrasted with those of the four myeloid α-defensins (HNP1-4) and of HD5, the other α-defensin of human Paneth cells.

METHODS A total of 158 patients who underwent laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer at the First Hospital of Jilin University (Changchun, China) between February 2015 and February 2016 were randomized into two groups: uncut Roux-en-Y (group U) and Billroth II group (group B). Postoperative complications and relevant clinical data were compared between the two groups. RESULTS According to the randomization table, each group included 79 patients. There was no significant difference in postoperative complications between groups U and B (7.6% vs 10.1%, P = 0.576). During the postoperative period, group U stomach pH values were lower than 7 and group B pH values were higher than 7. After 1 year of follow-up, group B presented a higher incidence of biliary reflux and alkaline gastritis. However, histopathology did not show a significant difference in gastritis diagnosis (P = 0.278), and the amount of residual food and gain of weight between the groups were also not significantly different. At 3 mo there was no evidence of partial recanalization of uncut staple line, but at 1 year the incidence was 13%. CONCLUSION Compared with Billroth II reconstruction, uncut Roux-en-Y reconstruction is secure and feasible, and can effectively reduce the incidence of alkaline reflux, residual gastritis, and heartburn. Despite the incidence of recanalization, uncut Roux-en-Y should be widely applied.","Yang, Dong; He, Liang; Tong, Wei-Hua; Jia, Zhi-Fang; Su, Tong-Rong; Wang, Quan",World journal of gastroenterology,572,5

When one or both values are elevated, additional analysis is important to establish the etiology of the disorder. Methemoglobinemia occurs from acquired or hereditary causes with diverse treatment considerations, while true sulfhemoglobinemia is only acquired and treatment is restricted to toxin removal. Some toxic exposures can result in a dual increase in MetHb and SHb. Hereditary conditions, such as M-Hemoglobin variants (M-Hbs), can result in increased MetHb and/or SHb values but are clinically compensated and do not require treatment if they are cyanotic but otherwise clinically well. METHODS Herein, we report 53 hemoglobin variant cases that have associated MetHb and SHb levels measured by an adapted Evelyn-Malloy laboratory assay method. RESULTS Our data indicate M-Hbs cause variable patterns of MetHb and SHb elevation in a fairly reproducible pattern for the particular variant. In particular, α globin chain M-Hbs can mimic acquired sulfhemoglobinemia due to an isolated increased SHb value. CONCLUSION If the patient appears clinically well other than cyanosis, M-Hbs should be considered early in the evaluation process to differentiate from acquired conditions to avoid unnecessary testing and treatment regimens and prompt genetic counseling.","Rangan, Aruna; Savedra, Michelle E; Dergam-Larson, Camila; Swanson, Kenneth C; Szuberski, Jessica; Go, Ronald S; Porter, Tavanna R; Brunker, Sarah E; Shi, Min; Nguyen, Phuong L; Hoyer, James D; Oliveira, Jennifer L",International journal of laboratory hematology,572,1

Complications of TRA include asymptomatic and less likely symptomatic radial artery occlusion, nonocclusive radial artery injury, radial artery spasm, radial arterial perforation, radial artery pseudoaneurysm, arteriovenous fistula, granuloma formation, access-site bleeding, nerve damage, complex regional pain syndrome along with other rare complications. Areas covered: A literature search was performed using MedLine, PubMed, and Google Scholar (dating to 05/1/2019). Authors reviewed all articles related to transradial artery catheterization, its complications, as well as novel techniques for their management. The article provides insight on the incidence, risk factors and prevention of such complications along with a description of usual and newer techniques to decrease morbidity. Expert opinion: With increasing experience, TRA complication rate is decreasing and new very uncommon complications are being described. A ""radial first"" approach should be implemented in all catheterization laboratories and a physician's familiarity with minor and major complications is a must. Distal radial artery access through the snuff box might be the preferred site of accessing the radial artery and further studies will be needed to prove its superiority to the current access site.","Aoun, Joe; Hattar, Laith; Dgaily, Khabib; Wong, Gordon; Bhat, Tariq",Expert review of cardiovascular therapy,572,31

We discuss the role of hydrodynamic interactions for three different systems: (i) the deformation and orientation of sedimenting semiflexible polymers, (ii) the propulsion and force-rectification with a nano-machine realized by a rotating elastic rod, and (iii) the deformation of a brush made of grafted semiflexible polymers in shear flow. In all these examples deformable polymers are subject to various hydrodynamic flows and hydrodynamic interactions. Perfect stiff nano-cylinders are known to show no orientational effects as they sediment through a viscous fluid, but it is the coupling between elasticity and hydrodynamic torques that leads to an orientation perpendicular to the direction of sedimentation. Likewise, a rotating stiff rod does not lead to a net propulsion in the Stokes limit, but if bending is allowed an effective thrust develops whose strength and direction is independent of the sense of rotation and thus acts as a rectification device. Lastly, surface-anchored polymers are deformed by shear flows, which modifies the effective hydrodynamic boundary condition in a non-linear fashion. All these results are obtained with hydrodynamic Brownian dynamics simulation techniques, as appropriate for dilute systems. Scaling analyses are presented when possible. The common theme is the interaction between elasticity of soft matter and hydrodynamics, which can lead to qualitatively new effects.","Manghi, Manoel; Schlagberger, Xaver; Kim, Yong-Woon; Netz, Roland R",Soft matter,572,20

In South Korea, which had been called the Hepatitis Kingdom, KIM developed a vaccine material for hepatitis B. Through his research achievements, South Korea, emerged from a country ignorant of hepatitis to a country with a hepatitis B vaccine. It is not easy to achieve remarkable results in developing countries where scientific development is lagging. This environment, however, helped KIM achieve his research. This article explains that the two circumstances affected his achievement in his research. First, KIM got a chance to study in the U.S. when he was his starting as a researcher. In the 1960s, the scientific and medical education environment in Korea was still poor. KIM left for Harvard University with the support of CMB, where he was able to advance his studies. This experience was an opportunity to further enhance his research skills. Second, Korea's poor health and hygiene environment in the 1970s worked in favor of verifying the effectiveness of vaccine materials he developed. South Korea, where hepatitis B was prevalent, became a good research site to secure enough test subjects. KIM also used blood sellers to find out the effects of the vaccine material he developed. Blood sellers are people who earn their living by selling their own blood and were commonly found in Korea at that time. The situation in Korea in the 1970s with prevailing hepatitis and the presence of blood sellers played an important role in KIM's research. His research on vaccine development for hepatitis B was hard to imagine in the scientific research environment of South Korea at the time. However, it was also this context and environment of South Korea at the time that enabled his achievement of developing a hepatitis B vaccine.","Shin, Miyoung",Ui sahak,572,1

Methods: Clinical samples were collected from February to July 2020 from Beijing Center for Diseases Prevention and Control and the Laboratory Department of China-Japan Friendship Hospital, to evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, anti-interference ability, precision and clinical sample coincidence rate of fast nucleic acid detection system for SARS-CoV-2. The analytical sensitivity was determined by a dilution series of 20 replications for each concentration. Analytical specificity study was performed by testing organisms whose infection produces symptoms similar to those observed at the onset of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and of the normal or pathogenic microflora that may be present in specimens collected. Potential interference substances were evaluated with different concentration in the interference study. Precision study was conducted by estimating intra-and inter-batch variability. Clinical evaluation was performed by testing 230 oropharyngeal swab specimens and 95 sputum specimens in fast nucleic acid detection system, comparing with conventional real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and clinical diagnostic results. Results: The analytical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 using fast nucleic acid detection system was 400 copies/ml. The result is negative for testing with the organisms that may likely in the circulating area or causing similar symptoms with SARS-CoV-2 and human nucleic acid, indicating that no cross reactivity with organisms. The results of precision test showed that the Coefficient of variation of Ct value of high, medium and low concentration samples was 1.90%-3.92%, and all of them were less than 5% in intra-and inter-batch testing. The results of the samples were still positive after adding the potential interfering substances, indicating that the possible interfering substances in the samples had no effect on the results. 98.46% and 97.85% diagnosis results of fast nucleic acid detection system were consistent with RT-qPCR and clinical diagnostic results, respectively. Conclusion: The fast nucleic acid detection system based on molecular parallel reaction can be used as a selection method for SARS-CoV-2 testing.","Ma, L; Cui, S J; Han, C W; Jiang, Y W; Zhao, M M; Liu, Y; Chen, L J; Cao, Y T",Zhonghua yu fang yi xue za zhi [Chinese journal of preventive medicine],572,1

METHODS A case-control study in 32 individuals with RA, 28 with SLE, and 29 in the control group (CG). The questionnaire SF-36 (Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36) was used to evaluate the health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and OHIP-14 (Oral Health Impact Profile-14) was used to evaluate the oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL). The severity of xerostomia was evaluated by the Xerostomia Inventory (XI). In the clinical examination, decayed (D-T), missing(M-T), and filled teeth (F-T) (DMF-T), periodontal status, plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), unstimulated whole salivary flow rate (UWSFR), and stimulated whole salivary flow rate (SWSFR) were also assessed. Data were analyzed by Student's t tests, chi-square test, Kruskal-Wallis test, ANOVA, Pearson's correlation, and Spearman's correlation. RESULTS Individuals with RA had a higher caries index (D-T/p = 0.004) and more frequent periodontal disease (PI/p = 0.017). In the SLE group, there was a significant lower salivary flow (SFR/p = 0.016, SFMS/p = 0.004) and severe xerostomia (p = 0.002). The impact of ORHQoL in individuals with RA occurred due to oral candidiasis, halitosis, and xerostomia, compromising the HRQoL. Overall, OHRQoL and HRQoL were more compromised in individuals with SLE, with xerostomia being the main oral problem.

There is a high variance in duration and course of symptoms which, sooner or later, also may disappear spontaneously and change during the course of the disease. Therefore, assessment of treatment outcome is difficult. METHODS Composite outcome measures are commonly used to examine the effects of pharmacotherapy in complex diseases. We discuss the features of the Bronchitis Severity Scale (BSS) on the basis of the available literature. RESULTS For the BSS the five most important symptoms of AB are rated by the patient and the physician. Since its introduction in 1996, the BSS has been used in many clinical trials evaluating treatment effects of AB. Its score correlates well with clinical findings. As thorough validation analyses revealed, this applies even more to the BSS subscales ""cough domain"" and ""sputum domain"".

We aimed to investigate the effects of HFNC on respiratory physiology. STUDY DESIGN A prospective randomised crossover study was performed enrolling clinically stable preterm infants receiving either HFNC or nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP). Infants in three current weight groups were studied: <1000 g, 1000-1500 g and >1500 g. Infants were randomised to either first receive HFNC flows 8-2 L/min and then nCPAP 6 cm H2O or nCPAP first and then HFNC flows 8-2 L/min. Nasopharyngeal end-expiratory airway pressure (pEEP), tidal volume, dead space washout by nasopharyngeal end-expiratory CO2 (pEECO2), oxygen saturation and vital signs were measured. RESULTS A total of 44 preterm infants, birth weights 500-1900 g, were studied. Increasing flows from 2 to 8 L/min significantly increased pEEP (mean 2.3-6.1 cm H2O) and reduced pEECO2 (mean 2.3%-0.9%). Tidal volume and transcutaneous CO2 were unchanged. Significant differences were seen between pEEP generated in open and closed mouth states across all HFNC flows (difference 0.6-2.3 cm H2O). Infants weighing <1000 g received higher pEEP at the same HFNC flow than infants weighing >1000 g. Variability of pEEP generated at HFNC flows of 6-8 L/min was greater than nCPAP (2.4-13.5 vs 3.5-9.9 cm H2O). CONCLUSIONS HFNC therapy produces clinically significant pEEP with large variability at higher flow rates. Highest pressures were observed in infants weighing <1000 g. Flow, weight and mouth position are all important determinants of pressures generated. Reductions in pEECO2 support HFNC's role in dead space washout.","Liew, Zheyi; Fenton, Alan C; Harigopal, Sundeep; Gopalakaje, Saikiran; Brodlie, Malcolm; O'Brien, Christopher J",Archives of disease in childhood.

The objective of this study is to determine whether specific antidepressant effects, estimated by drug-placebo differences, are reduced in anxious depression during treatment of MDD with duloxetine. METHODS This is a retrospective secondary pooled analysis of all placebo-controlled trials of duloxetine at therapeutic doses conducted by the sponsor in outpatients with nonpsychotic unipolar MDD, using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD). Anxious depression was defined by > or =7 on the anxiety/somatization factor of the HAMD. Response was defined as > or =50% improvement from baseline to endpoint on the HAMD. Remission was defined as an endpoint HAMD< or =7. Analyses were performed in the intent-to-treat sample with at least one post-treatment rating. RESULTS Eleven trials included 2,841 patients of whom 1,326 were classified as anxious and 1,515 as nonanxious.

Systematic review and meta-analysis. Fifteen studies with a total of 775 participants were included. Twelve studies were of high quality and three studies were of moderate quality using the modified Black and Downs checklist. There was no between group difference in AHD in neutral shoulder position (mean difference [95% CI] 0.28 [-0.13 to 0.69] mm), shoulder abduction at 45° (-0.02 [-0.99 to 0.96] mm) or 60° (-0.20 [-0.61 to 0.20] mm).

Regardless of the organ compromised, epithelial dysfunction is present throughout the body, affecting those organs that contain epithelia like the skin, lungs, liver, gut, and kidneys. Despite their obvious differences, sepsis seems to alter common features of all epithelia, such as barrier function and vectorial ion transport. Such alterations in the lung, the gut, and the kidney have direct implications that may explain the profound organ functional impairments in the absence of overt cell death. Epithelial injury in this context is not only an explanatory real pathophysiologic event, but also represents a source of biomarkers that have been explored to identify organ compromise earlier, predict outcome, and even to test novel therapeutic interventions such as blood purification. However, this remains largely experimental, and despite promising results, work is still required to better understand the response of the epithelial cells to sepsis, to define their role in adaptation to insults, to comprehend the interorgan cross-talk that occurs in these circumstances, and to exploit these aspects in pursuit of targeted therapies like blood purification, which may improve outcome for these patients in the future.","Chawla, Lakhmir S; Fink, Mitchell; Goldstein, Stuart L; Opal, Steven; Gómez, Alonso; Murray, Patrick; Gómez, Hernando; Kellum, John A",Shock,572,16

No study has investigated the effect of a continuous block of the saphenous and superficial peroneal nerves at the level of the ankle joint following first ray surgery. A double blind randomized controlled trial was designed. One hundred patients with hallux valgus and rigidus requiring surgical correction were recruited and randomized to receive a postoperative continuous infusion at the ankle of normal saline or ropivacaine for 24 hours. Pain scores were recorded on postoperative days 1 and 7. There were more females than males. Follow-up was 100%. There were no significant differences in demographic data between the 2 randomized groups. There was no significant difference between the absolute visual analog scale scores on day 1 (P = .14) and day 7 (P = .16); nor was there a significant difference in reduction in scores between days 1 and 7 (P = .70). This study has shown no benefit to postoperative analgesia with the use of a continuous infusion of ropivacaine at the ankle. We, therefore, cannot currently recommend its use in the way described. Further studies may still identify a role for continuous local anesthetic infusions at the ankle to improve postoperative analgesia.

OBJECTIVE To review our results in this subset of patients and describe current endovascular decision-making and approaches. METHODS We reviewed cases of endovascular sinus sacrifice for dural fistulas at our institution from 2007 to 2012. Demographic, decision-making, technical and outcome data were collected. RESULTS Seven patients were identified who underwent endovascular sinus sacrifice for treatment of dural fistula during this 4-year period. Determination of the fistulous sinus segment was based on the pattern of cortical drainage. Endovascular access to the sinus was achieved by transarterial, transvenous or via open surgery in one case. Complete cure of the target fistula was obtained in all cases. One patient had transient post-procedure headache. There were no hemorrhages, new neurological deficits or signs of increased intracranial pressure. Six of the seven patients had angiographic follow-up at least 6 months after treatment with no recurrence. CONCLUSIONS Fistulas of the transverse-sigmoid sinuses with cortical reflux may require sacrifice of the parent sinus for cure. Defining the fistulous segment and occluding this segment deliberately, completely and precisely is essential for cure. Several modalities and approaches can be used to achieve this. For properly selected patients, cure of the lesions can be achieved with this method with low risk of morbidity.","Carlson, Andrew Phillip; Alaraj, Ali; Amin-Hanjani, Sepideh; Charbel, Fady T; Aletich, Victor",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,572,1

METHODS We performed a double-blind trial randomizing osteoarthritic knee patients undergoing unilateral TKA done by either using scalpel (group S) or cautery (group C). Primary outcomes were total blood loss calculated from maximum haemoglobin drop and blood loss collected in drain. Secondary outcomes were systemic inflammatory response (serum C-reactive protein), wound complications, and functional outcomes assessed over three months. RESULTS A total of 80 patients were recruited. Group S had similar calculated total blood loss compared to group C (1070 (S) vs 1128 (C) mL, 95% CI - 219 to 103, p = 0.47). There was no difference in the mean drain-collected blood loss between the two groups (443 (S) vs 486 (C) mL, 95% CI - 128 to 47, p = 0.36). Group C had higher serum C-reactive protein level at 48 hours after TKA compare to group S (105 vs 140 mg/dL, 95% CI - 66 to - 4, p = 0.03). Wound complications and functional outcomes at three months were also similar between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS Using electric cautery does not reduce total blood loss as we thought it would be in primary TKA compare to scalpel only surgery and it is also associated with a greater systemic inflammatory response. Cautery used in TKA which operated under tourniquet may not be worthwhile for the risk of hazardous smoke and the increasing cost.","Tammachote, Nattapol; Kanitnate, Supakit",International orthopaedics,572,19

DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. SETTING A 472-bed acute-care teaching hospital in Toronto, Canada. PATIENTS Inpatients who shared a room between 1996 and 2004 with a patient who had unrecognized MRSA colonization. METHODS Exposed roommates were identified from infection-control logs and from results of screening for MRSA in the microbiology database. Completed follow-up was defined as completion of at least 2 sets of screening cultures (swab samples from the nares, the rectum, and skin lesions), with at least 1 set of samples obtained 7-10 days after the last exposure. Chart reviews were performed to compare those who did and did not become colonized with MRSA. RESULTS Of 326 roommates, 198 (61.7%) had completed follow-up, and 25 (12.6%) acquired MRSA by day 7-10 after exposure was recognized, all with strains indistinguishable by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis from those of their roommate. Two (2%) of 101 patients were not colonized at day 7-10 but, with subsequent testing, were identified as being colonized with the same strain as their roommate (one at day 16 and one at day 18 after exposure). A history of alcohol abuse (odds ratio [OR], 9.8 [95% confidence limits {CLs}, 1.8, 53]), exposure to a patient with nosocomially acquired MRSA (OR, 20 [95% CLs, 2.4, 171]), increasing care dependency (OR per activity of daily living, 1.7 [95% CLs, 1.1, 2.7]), and having received levofloxacin (OR, 3.6 [95% CLs, 1.1, 12]) were associated with MRSA acquisition. CONCLUSIONS Roommates of patients with MRSA are at significant risk for becoming colonized.

Germline development defective 2 (GLD-2) is among the first reported cytoplasmic non-canonical PAPs that promotes the translation of germline-specific mRNAs by extending their short poly(A) tails in metazoan, such as Caenorhabditis elegans and Xenopus. On the other hand, the function of mammalian GLD-2 seems more diverse, which includes monoadenylation of certain microRNAs. To understand the structural basis that underlies the difference between mammalian and non-mammalian GLD-2 proteins, we determine crystal structures of two rodent GLD-2s. Different from C. elegans GLD-2, mammalian GLD-2 is an intrinsically robust PAP with an extensively positively charged surface. Rodent and C. elegans GLD-2s have a topological difference in the β-sheet region of the central domain. Whereas C. elegans GLD-2 prefers adenosine-rich RNA substrates, mammalian GLD-2 can work on RNA oligos with various sequences. Coincident with its activity on microRNAs, mammalian GLD-2 structurally resembles the mRNA and miRNA processor terminal uridylyltransferase 7 (TUT7). Our study reveals how GLD-2 structurally evolves to a more versatile nucleotidyltransferase, and provides important clues in understanding its biological function in mammals.","Ma, Xiao-Yan; Zhang, Hong; Feng, Jian-Xiong; Hu, Jia-Li; Yu, Bing; Luo, Li; Cao, Yu-Lu; Liao, Shuang; Wang, Jichang; Gao, Song",Nucleic acids research,572,32

One hour after starting the first session of HD, he experienced general pruritus, urticaria, and dyspnea. Signs and symptoms were resolved by discontinuing HD and administrating an antihistamine drug; HD-associated anaphylactoid reactions were therefore suspected. Over the next few HD sessions, we changed the dialysis membrane, anticoagulant, HD circuit and needle, in that order, but general pruritus and urticaria again appeared within 3 h after starting each session of HD. Finally, when we changed the dialysate from acetate-containing bicarbonate dialysate to acetate-free bicarbonate dialysate, urticaria was clearly less than that seen in previous HD sessions, and subsided after discontinuation of HD. Subsequently, 20 mg of oral prednisolone (PSL) was administered 1 h before starting HD, and the patient did not experience general pruritus, urticaria, or dyspnea after starting the session.

A key question is what motivates individuals to take and support such actions. Early in the COVID-19 crisis, we hypothesized and found in two studies (in the Netherlands and United States) that stronger worries about potential consequences of COVID-19 for oneself and close others (i.e., family and friends), as well as more ""distant"" others (e.g., citizens in general, vulnerable populations), are associated with stronger engagement in actions to mitigate COVID-19. In line with reasoning on norm activation, we found that these associations were partly mediated by personal norms, reflecting individuals' feelings of being morally compelled and personally responsible to take mitigative actions. Importantly, individuals generally reported to worry more about consequences of COVID-19 for distant others than for themselves, and worries about distant others were more strongly related to mitigative actions than worries about oneself and close others. Our outcomes offer key novel insights to the health domain, highlighting the potential relevance of worrying about distant others and personal norms in motivating actions to mitigate global health crises.","Bouman, Thijs; Steg, Linda",Health communication,572,1

Using data from this trial, we performed a subgroup analysis of angiographic and clinical outcomes of patients with ""difficult-to-treat"" aneurysms, defined as irregularly shaped and/or having a dome-to-neck ratio of <1.5. MATERIALS AND METHODS Separate subgroup analyses comparing outcomes of treatment with HydroCoils to that of bare platinum coils were performed for the following: 1) irregularly shaped aneurysms, 2) regularly shaped aneurysms, 3) aneurysms with a dome-to-neck ratio of <1.5, and 4) aneurysms with a dome-to-neck ratio of ≥1.5. For each subgroup analysis, the following outcomes were studied at the last follow-up (3-18 months): 1) any recurrence, 2) major recurrence, 3) re-treatment, and 4) an mRS score of ≤2. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine if the HydroCoil was independently associated with improved outcomes in these subgroups. RESULTS Among the patients with an irregularly shaped aneurysm, the HydroCoil was associated with lower major recurrence rates than the bare platinum coils (17 of 66 [26%] vs 30 of 69 [44%], respectively; P = .046). Among the patients with an aneurysm with a small dome-to-neck ratio, the HydroCoil was associated with lower major recurrence rates than the bare platinum coils (18 of 73 [24.7%] vs 32 of 76 [42.1%], respectively; P = .02). No difference in major recurrence was seen between HydroCoils and bare platinum coils for regularly shaped aneurysms (42 of 152 [27.6%] vs 52 of 162 [32.1%], respectively; P = .39) or aneurysms with a large dome-to-neck ratio (41 of 145 [28.3%] vs 50 of 155 [32.3%], respectively; P = .53). CONCLUSIONS This unplanned post hoc subgroup analysis found that HydroCoils are associated with improved angiographic outcomes in the treatment of irregularly shaped aneurysms and aneurysms with a dome-to-neck ratio of <1.5. Because this was a post hoc analysis, these results are not reliable and absolutely should not alter clinical practice but, rather, may inform the design of future randomized controlled trials.","Brinjikji, W; White, P M; Nahser, H; Wardlaw, J; Sellar, R; Gholkar, A; Cloft, H J; Kallmes, D F",AJNR.

In response, federal nutrition assistance programs have introduced flexibility waivers in programs, including the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), to rapidly respond to support the nutritional health status of income-eligible participants during COVID-19. Waivers were approved that permitted flexibilities in the WIC food package, WIC vendor guidelines, and WIC clinic experience. The impact of these waivers on WIC participants' retail and clinic experiences remains unknown. OBJECTIVES Our aims were to understand the experiences of WIC participants in food retail settings and with WIC clinics during the COVID-19 pandemic and to explore WIC participants' perceptions of the impact of COVID-19 on their family's overall health, well-being, and daily lives. DESIGN We conducted semi-structured phone interviews between April 30 and May 7, 2020. PARTICIPANTS/SETTING Participants were 24 adults in WIC-enrolled families residing in Tennessee. ANALYSIS Using grounded theory as the analytical framework, 2 coders completed an iterative, data-driven analytic process within NVivo, version 12. Hierarchical maps, coding matrices, and concept maps were used to aid direct content analysis for theme detection. RESULTS Five primary themes emerged, including shopping barriers (existing compounded with new), coping strategies, impact on mental and emotional health, social comparison, and unintended consequences of COVID-19 on WIC families. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 created additional barriers to food security among WIC families and negatively affected their health and well-being. To meet the needs of this vulnerable population during and beyond the pandemic, the carryover of WIC flexibilities (ie, physical presence and food package substitution waivers) after COVID-19 may improve the ease of overall program participation.","McElrone, Marissa; Zimmer, Meghan C; Anderson Steeves, Elizabeth T",Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics,572,6

The Thai National Disease Control program at the Ministry of Public Health has identified suitable measure for mass screening. A SARS-CoV-2 antigen-based assay is a surveillance option for active cases. Here, we evaluated the feasibility and test performance of a rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen test during our field activities in 1,100 asymptomatic individuals in Samut Sakhon, Thailand, during the second wave COVID-19 outbreak (December 26-30, 2020). The results showed that the rapid antigen test had a sensitivity of 47.97% (95% CI: 36.10-59.96%) and a specificity of 99.71% (95% CI: 99.15-99.94%) versus standard reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The rapid test performed better in cases with higher viral loads determined by the cycle threshold value. In real-world setting, the test performance can be compromised by several factors including viral loads, logistic chains, temperature, technical expertise of the operators, validity, and accuracy of the testing itself.

The analysis' objective was to evaluate the image of the nurse in national and local newspapers, published between the 30th of January and the 18th of May 2020. A triangulation methodology was used between the two researchers to ensure data quality. R ESULTS Five themes were identified. The risks for the nurse's psycho-physic wellbeing. Taking responsibility and human relations despite barriers. The acknowledgment of professional attributes. Uncertainty on the continuity of the nurses' social role emerged from the media. Nurses only wish to be appreciated for what they do. The agreement between the researchers on the themes has a Krippendor ff 's alpha between =0.713 and =0.985. CONCLUSIONS The media's interest highlighted the nurses' competence in assisting patients with COVID-19. However, there isn't in-depth analysis, of the contemporar y image of the nurse, specifically in relation to leadership. Positive and negative tropes are recalled. The superficiality and fragility of the mediatic phenomena emerged, as opposed to a real positive strengthening of the nurse's social perception.","Giorgetta, Stefano; Pasquot, Laura",Professioni infermieristiche,572,16

Right mandibular, and right and left maxillary nerve blocks were administered using a 1 ml syringe attached to a 25 G x 5/8 inch needle and an intraoral technique. The following day the cat displayed blepharospasm of the right eye. The ocular signs progressed and 5 days later an ophthalmologist confirmed a blind, glaucomatous right eye. It was suspected that the eye had suffered a penetrating injury during dental surgery. Enucleation of the right eye was performed and gross and histopathological examination revealed a penetrating wound consistent with a needle tract injury. PRACTICAL RELEVANCE Complications arising from veterinary dental regional anaesthesia appear to be rare; however, it may be that they are under-reported. This case report highlights the risks involved and reviews the safest and most efficacious regional anaesthesia technique for the feline maxilla.","Perry, Rachel; Moore, Denise; Scurrell, Emma",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,572,1

Appropriate public health and control measures will require discovery of the zoonotic MERS coronavirus reservoirs. The relevant animal hosts are liable to be those that offer optimal MERS virus cell entry. Cell entry begins with virus spike (S) protein binding to DPP4 receptors. We constructed chimeric DPP4 receptors that have the virus-binding domains of indigenous Middle Eastern animals and assessed the activities of these receptors in supporting S protein binding and virus entry. Human, camel, and horse receptors were potent and nearly equally effective MERS virus receptors, while goat and bat receptors were considerably less effective. These patterns reflected S protein affinities for the receptors. However, even the low-affinity receptors could hypersensitize cells to infection when an S-cleaving protease(s) was present, indicating that affinity thresholds for virus entry must be considered in the context of host-cell proteolytic environments. These findings suggest that virus receptors and S protein-cleaving proteases combine in a variety of animals to offer efficient virus entry and that several Middle Eastern animals are potential reservoirs for transmitting MERS-CoV to humans. IMPORTANCE MERS is a frequently fatal disease that is caused by a zoonotic CoV. The animals transmitting MERS-CoV to humans are not yet known. Infection by MERS-CoV requires receptors and proteases on host cells. We compared the receptors of humans and Middle Eastern animals and found that human, camel, and horse receptors sensitized cells to MERS-CoV infection more robustly than goat and bat receptors. Infection susceptibility correlated with affinities of the receptors for viral spike proteins. We also found that the presence of a cell surface lung protease greatly increases susceptibility to MERS-CoV, particularly in conjunction with low-affinity receptors. This cataloguing of human and animal host cell factors allows one to make inferences on the distribution of MERS-CoV in nature.","Barlan, Arlene; Zhao, Jincun; Sarkar, Mayukh K; Li, Kun; McCray, Paul B; Perlman, Stanley; Gallagher, Tom",Journal of virology,572,31

This is the idea behind ""Scientific data sharing: an interdisciplinary workshop"", an initiative designed to foster dialogue between scholars from different scientific domains which was organized by the Istituto Italiano di Antropologia in Anagni, Italy, 2-4 September 2013.We here report summaries of the presentations and discussions at the meeting. They deal with four sets of issues: (i) setting a common framework, a general discussion of open data principles, values and opportunities; (ii) insights into scientific practices, a view of the way in which the open data movement is developing in a variety of scientific domains (biology, psychology, epidemiology and archaeology); (iii) a case study of human genomics, which was a trail-blazer in data sharing, and which encapsulates the tension that can occur between large-scale data sharing and one of the boundaries of openness, the protection of individual data; (iv) open science and the public, based on a round table discussion about the public communication of science and the societal implications of open science. There were three proposals for the planning of further interdisciplinary initiatives on open science. Firstly, there is a need to integrate top-down initiatives by governments, institutions and journals with bottom-up approaches from the scientific community. Secondly, more should be done to popularize the societal benefits of open science, not only in providing the evidence needed by citizens to draw their own conclusions on scientific issues that are of concern to them, but also explaining the direct benefits of data sharing in areas such as the control of infectious disease. Finally, introducing arguments from social sciences and humanities in the educational dissemination of open data may help students become more profoundly engaged with Open Science and look at science from a broader perspective.","Destro Bisol, Giovanni; Anagnostou, Paolo; Capocasa, Marco; Bencivelli, Silvia; Cerroni, Andrea; Contreras, Jorge; Enke, Neela; Fantini, Bernardino; Greco, Pietro; Heeney, Catherine; Luzi, Daniela; Manghi, Paolo; Mascalzoni, Deborah; Molloy, Jennifer; Parenti, Fabio; Wicherts, Jelte; Boulton, Geoffrey",Journal of anthropological sciences = Rivista di antropologia : JASS,572,11

Protocols including pre-operative self-isolation, COVID-19 testing, and surgery at a non-COVID-19 site have been developed to minimize risk of transmission. Despite this, it is likely that many patients will want to delay surgery for fear of contracting COVID-19. The aim of this study is to identify the number of patients who still want to proceed with planned elective orthopaedic surgery in this current environment. Methods This is a prospective, single surgeon study of 102 patients who were on the waiting list for an elective hip or knee procedure during the COVID-19 pandemic. Baseline characteristics including age, ASA grade, COVID-19 risk, procedure type, surgical priority, and admission type were recorded. The primary outcome was patient consent to continue with planned surgical care after resumption of elective orthopaedic services. Subgroup analysis was also performed to determine if any specific patient factors influenced the decision to proceed with surgery. Results Overall, 58 patients (56.8%) wanted to continue with planned surgical care at the earliest possibility. Patients classified as ASA I and ASA II were more likely to agree to surgery (60.5% and 60.0%, respectively) compared to ASA III and ASA IV patients (44.4% and 0.0%, respectively) (p = 0.01). In addition, patients undergoing soft tissue knee surgery were more likely to consent to surgery (90.0%) compared to patients undergoing primary hip arthroplasty (68.6%), primary knee arthroplasty (48.7%), revision hip or knee arthroplasty (0.0%), or hip and knee injections (43.8%) (p = 0.03). Conclusion Restarting elective orthopaedic services during the COVID-19 pandemic remains a significant challenge. Given the uncertain environment, it is unsurprising that only 56% of patients were prepared to continue with their planned surgical care upon resumption of elective services.Cite this article: Bone Joint Open 2020;1-6:267-271.","Chang, Justin; Wignadasan, Warran; Kontoghiorghe, Christina; Kayani, Babar; Singh, Sandeep; Plastow, Ricci; Magan, Ahmed; Haddad, Fares",Bone & joint open,572,31

SARS-CoV-2 causes a generally mild, but sometimes severe and even life-threatening infection, known as COVID-19. Currently, there exist no effective vaccines or drugs and, as such, global public authorities have so far relied upon non pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). Since COVID-19 symptoms are aspecific and may resemble a common cold, if it should come back with a seasonal pattern and coincide with the influenza season, this would be particularly challenging, overwhelming and straining the healthcare systems, particularly in resource-limited contexts, and would increase the likelihood of nosocomial transmission. In the present study, we devised a mathematical model focusing on the treatment of people complaining of influenza-like-illness (ILI) symptoms, potentially at risk of contracting COVID-19 or other emerging/re-emerging respiratory infectious agents during their admission at the health-care setting, who will occupy the detection kits causing a severe shortage of testing resources. The model is used to assess the effect of mass influenza vaccination on the spread of COVID-19 and other respiratory pathogens in the case of a coincidence of the outbreak with the influenza season. Here, we show that increasing influenza vaccine uptake or enhancing the public health interventions would facilitate the management of respiratory outbreaks coinciding with the peak flu season, especially, compensate the shortage of the detection resources. However, how to increase influenza vaccination coverage rate remains challenging. Public health decision- and policy-makers should adopt evidence-informed strategies to improve influenza vaccine uptake.","Li, Qian; Tang, Biao; Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi; Xiao, Yanni; Wu, Jianhong",Mathematical biosciences,572,1

The under-representation of transmembrane proteins in the Protein Data Bank highlights the need to apply new and advanced bioinformatics methods to shed light on their structure and function. This study focuses on a family of transmembrane proteins containing the Pfam domain PF09335 ('SNARE_ASSOC'/ 'VTT '/'Tvp38'/'DedA'). One prominent member, Tmem41b, has been shown to be involved in early stages of autophagosome formation and is vital in mouse embryonic development as well as being identified as a viral host factor of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We used evolutionary covariance-derived information to construct and validate ab initio models, make domain boundary predictions and infer local structural features. Results: The results from the structural bioinformatics analysis of Tmem41b and its homologues showed that they contain a tandem repeat that is clearly visible in evolutionary covariance data but much less so by sequence analysis. Furthermore, cross-referencing of other prediction data with covariance analysis showed that the internal repeat features two-fold rotational symmetry. Ab initio modelling of Tmem41b and homologues reinforces these structural predictions. Local structural features predicted to be present in Tmem41b were also present in Cl -/H + antiporters. Conclusions: The results of this study strongly point to Tmem41b and its homologues being transporters for an as-yet uncharacterised substrate and possibly using H + antiporter activity as its mechanism for transport.","Mesdaghi, Shahram; Murphy, David L; Sánchez Rodríguez, Filomeno; Burgos-Mármol, J Javier; Rigden, Daniel J",F1000Research,572,7

METHODS The retrospective analysis of 5058 OHCA cases was made covering the period from January 1st, 2006 to December 31st, 2018. Circadian, weekly, monthly and seasonal variabilities were investigated. The circadian variability of OHCA occurrence was assessed within particular years, seasons of the years, and days of the week. RESULTS The highest OHCA incidence was observed between 08:00 and 08:59 and the lowest between 01:00 and 01:59 (7.1% vs. 1.6%, p < 0.001). After division into 6-h intervals, a significantly lower number of OHCA cases occurred between 00:00 and 05:59 (12.3%) in comparison to the highest number observed in between 06:00 and 11:59 (12.3 vs. 33.5%, p < 0.001).

AIM Establish possible prognostic factors of severe psoriasis. METHODS Three groups of patients were included: 118 were on topical therapy, 83 used conventional systemic drugs and 112 were treated with biological agents. Based of the fact that patients on topical therapy have a lower grade of disease severity than patients treated systemically, we compared a variety of comorbidities and epidemiological parameters between the three groups. RESULTS Patients treated more aggressively have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (p = 0.044), suffer more from depression (p = 0.020), hyperuricemia (p = 0.031) and nonspecific non-infectious liver disease (p = 0.005). Male gender (p < 0.001), increased height (p < 0.001), early age of disease onset (p < 0.001), viral upper respiratory infections (p = 0.049) and periods of hormonal changes (p = 0.045) are associated with these therapies. CONCLUSION Psoriasis severity is directly related to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, depression, hyperuricemia and nonspecific non-infectious liver disease. Male gender, increased height, early age of disease onset, viral upper respiratory infections and periods of hormonal changes seem to be prognostic of higher degrees of psoriasis severity. We are pioneering the use of increased height and puberty, menopause/andropause as independent prognostic factors of psoriasis severity.","Marques, Emanuel; Paluch, Zoltán; Boháč, Petr; Slanař, Ondřej; Běláček, Jaromír; Hercogová, Jana",The Journal of dermatological treatment,572,1

Catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT), with or without the addition of mechanical techniques, is increasingly recommended for patients with iliofemoral DVT, although its effect on postthrombotic syndrome is not established. This study examined the correlation of residual thrombus with postthrombotic syndrome after catheter-based attempts at thrombus removal in patients with iliofemoral DVT. METHODS Seventy-one consecutive patients with iliofemoral DVT were treated with CDT. Pretreatment and posttreatment phlebograms were evaluated for quantity of residual thrombus by physicians blinded to clinical patient outcomes. Postthrombotic syndrome was assessed using CEAP and Villalta scores by examiners blinded to phlebographic results. Patients were grouped by the amount of residual thrombus in treated vein segments (group 1, ≤50%; group 2, >50%). Clinical score and postthrombotic outcomes were plotted vs residual thrombus. RESULTS Sixty-three of 71 patients completed CEAP and Villalta analyses. Groups 1 and 2 had median CEAP scores of 1 and 4 (P = .025) and mean Villalta scores of 2.21 and 7.13, respectively (P = .011). There was a direct and significant correlation of clinical class of CEAP with residual thrombus (R(2) = .74; P = .004) and a direct linear correlation of Villalta score with residual thrombus (R(2) = .61; P = .0014). CONCLUSIONS In patients with iliofemoral DVT treated with catheter-based techniques of thrombus removal, postthrombotic morbidity is related to residual thrombus. When thrombus clearance was complete, the postthrombotic syndrome was avoided. Residual thrombus is associated with an increasing risk of postthrombotic syndrome.","Comerota, Anthony J; Grewal, Nina; Martinez, Jorge Trabal; Chen, John Tahao; Disalle, Robert; Andrews, Linda; Sepanski, Deb; Assi, Zakaria",Journal of vascular surgery,572,14

Surgical options for ESA are often limited to esophagectomy for management of severe dysphagia or life-threatening aspiration episodes. Mediastinoscopy-assisted transhiatal esophagectomy (MATHE) by a small left neck incision combined with an abdominal incision, without using a transthoracic approach, has been reported to reduce pulmonary complications. We herein present the first report of MATHE in 2 consecutive patients with ESA and gastric bypass. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between August 2017 and September 2020, 2 patients who had undergone Heller myotomy and Roux en Y gastric bypass underwent MATHE for ESA. Transhiatal esophagectomy with mediastinoscopy-assisted dissection was performed. The remnant stomach was used as the conduit in both cases. The embedded Supplemental Digital Content 1 (http://links.lww.com/SLE/A269) reports our novel technique. RESULTS Both cases were completed laparoscopically without conversion to laparotomy or thoracotomy. Median length of hospital stay was 9 days (range, 6 to 11 d).

The characteristic facial and limb dysmorphism for RSTS was absent in our patient. In addition, our patient exhibited novel phenotypes including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), sleep problem, and abnormal walking posture. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) identified a novel de novo in-frame deletion variant in the beginning of exon 30 of CREBBP (NM_004380:c.4897_4899delTTC, p.Phe1633del) in the HAT domain where no pathogenic variants have been previously reported to be responsible for atypical RSTS. Our case allows us to more accurately define the borders of the CREBBP coding sequence resulting in atypical RSTS, which are extended to the beginning of exon 30 (residue 1633) at the 5' end of CREBBP in the HAT domain, and reveals novel phenotypes observed in our atypical Chinese RSTS patient.","Wang, Qingming; Xu, Wanfang; Liu, Yanhui; Yuan, Haiming",Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN,572,19

We investigated reproducibility and how setting diagnostic cut-offs altered the clinical sensitivity of COVID-19 testing. METHODS Quantitative SARS-CoV-2 RNA distributions (Cq and copies/mL) from more than 6000 patients from three clinical laboratories in UK, Belgium and the Republic of Korea were analyzed. Impact of Cq cut-offs on clinical sensitivity was assessed. The June/July 2020 INSTAND EQA scheme SARS-CoV-2 materials were used to estimate laboratory reported copies/mL and to estimate the variation in copies/mL for a given Cq. RESULTS When the WHO suggested Cq cut-off of 25 was applied, the clinical sensitivity dropped to as little as about 16%. Clinical sensitivity also dropped to as little as about 27% when a simulated LOD of 106 copies/mL was applied. The inter-laboratory variation for a given Cq value was >1000 fold in copies/mL (99% CI). CONCLUSION While RT-qPCR has been instrumental in the response to COVID-19, we recommend Cq (Ct or Cp) values not be used to set clinical cut-offs, or diagnostic performance targets, due to poor inter-laboratory reproducibility; calibrated copy-based units (used elsewhere in virology) offer more reproducible alternatives. We also report a phenomenon where diagnostic performance may change relative to the effective reproduction number (R). Our findings indicate that the disparities between patient populations across time are an important consideration when evaluating or deploying diagnostic tests. This is especially relevant to the emergency situation of an evolving pandemic.","Evans, Daniel; Cowen, Simon; Kammel, Martin; O'Sullivan, Denise M; Stewart, Graham; Grunert, Hans-Peter; Moran-Gilad, Jacob; Verwilt, Jasper; In, Jiwon; Vandesompele, Jo; Harris, Kathryn; Hong, Ki Ho; Storey, Nathaniel; Hingley-Wilson, Suzie; Dühring, Ulf; Bae, Young-Kyung; Foy, Carole; Braybrook, Julian; Zeichhardt, Heinz; Huggett, Jim F",Clinical chemistry,572,12

Its expression is upregulated in several types of human carcinomas and podoplanin levels in squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) of the oral cavity and the lung correlate with cancer invasiveness, lymph node metastasis and shorter survival time of patients, indicating that podoplanin promotes tumor progression. However, its role during the early stages of carcinogenesis remain unclear. We generated mice with a specific deletion of podoplanin in epidermal keratinocytes (K5-Cre;Pdpnflox/flox mice) and subjected them to a multistep chemical skin carcinogenesis regimen. The rate of tumor initiation; the number, size and differentiation of tumors; and the malignant transformation rate were comparable in K5-Cre;Pdpnflox/flox mice and Pdpnflox/flox control mice. However, tumor cell invasion was reduced in K5-Cre;Pdpnflox/flox mice, in particular single cell invasion. Quantitative immunofluorescence analyses revealed that peritumoral lymphangiogenesis was reduced in K5-Cre;Pdpnflox/flox mice, whereas there were no major changes of tumor-associated immune cell subpopulations. Thus, keratinocyte-expressed podoplanin is dispensable for the early steps of skin carcinogenesis but contributes to the progression of established tumors.","Sesartić, Marko; Ikenberg, Kristian; Yoon, Sun-Young; Detmar, Michael",Cells,572,31

In this retrospective study, we compared the efficacy of both treatments in 154 patients with very early-stage HCCs who underwent resection or RFA as initial therapy and were followed up for a median of 56.8 months. Propensity score matching analysis was also conducted. Overall survival was comparable between treatment groups (median survival time of 143 vs 97 months for resection and RFA, respectively; P = .132). Resection group; however, demonstrated a significantly lower recurrence rate after initial therapy than RFA group (42.3% vs 65.7%; P = .006) with a longer median recurrence-free survival time (66.7 vs 33.8 months; P = .002), which was confirmed even after matching (P = .04). In contrast, the recurrence pattern in advanced-stage (9.6% vs 1.0%; P = .01) or incurable recurrences (19% vs 13%; P = .04) was more frequent following resection than RFA. Recurrent lesions were comparatively more curable in RFA group than in resection group (80% vs 54.5%; P = .02). The recurrence of HCC was independently associated with lower serum albumin level (P = .027), the presence of comorbid diabetes mellitus (P = .010), and RFA (P = .034). In conclusion, in patients with very early-stage HCC, surgical resection has achieved significantly better recurrence-free survival than RFA. A closer follow-up is required after resection.","Kim, Tae Hyung; Chang, Jung Mi; Um, Soon Ho; Jee, Heejung; Lee, Yoo Ra; Lee, Han Ah; Yim, Sun Young; Han, Na Yeon; Lee, Jae Min; Choi, Hyuk Soon; Kim, Eun Sun; Yu, Young-Dong; Keum, Bora; Kim, Min Ju; An, Hyunggin; Park, Beom Jin; Seo, Yeon Seok; Kim, Dong-Sik; Yim, Hyung Joon; Cho, Sung Bum; Jeen, Yoon Tae; Lee, Hong Sik; Chun, Hoon Jai; Kim, Yun Hwan; Kim, Chang Duck",Medicine,572,9

Here, we investigated for the first time whether, consistent with psychological models of loneliness, biased interpretations of social situations could prospectively predict loneliness in youth. 104 young people completed measures of loneliness and interpretations of ambiguous social and non-social (bodily or health-related) situations at three time-points with intervals of three months between each. As government-imposed social distancing measures (to control the COVID-19 outbreak) occurred between Times 2 and 3 (but not between Times 1 and 2), this enabled us to assess whether restricted social activity could provoke greater predictive power of biased interpretational styles on loneliness. Using cross-lagged panel models, we showed that after estimating paths representing within-time across-variable (""concurrent"") paths and across-time within-variable (""stability"") paths, there were no significant cross-lag 'causal' paths between earlier interpretational style and later loneliness. Between Time 2 and 3, we demonstrated a significant cross-lag 'consequential' path between earlier loneliness and later threatening interpretations of social situations, but this became non-significant after controlling for concurrent anxiety and depression. Biased interpretational style may reflect a concurrent maintenance factor of youth loneliness.","Lau, JenniferY F; Shariff, Rimsha; Meehan, AlanJ",Behaviour research and therapy,572,1

We sought to evaluate the only post-polio syndrome specific self-management programme in the United Kingdom. Methods This was a retrospective study of patients who had completed a residential self-management programme led by a multi-disciplinary clinical team. Following a confirmed diagnosis of post-polio syndrome by rehabilitation and neurology specialists, patients were offered to participate in the programme. Although group-based, patients also received individually tailored support on physical exercise and fatigue management. Physical effects, physical function, psychosocial well-being measures were assessed at baseline and 6 months follow-up. Knowledge was tested at baseline and immediately following the programme. Statistical comparisons were made using paired t-test and Wilcoxon signed rank test according to the data distribution. Results Over a period of 17 years, 214 participants (median age 61.3 years old, 63% female) attended 31 programmes. At 6 months the following post-polio syndrome specific symptoms improved significantly: fatigue, as measured by the Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue scale [37.6 (7.1) vs. 34.2 (9.3), P=0.005]; and pain [15.0 (6.1) vs. 13.1 (6.7), P=0.001], atrophy [10.0 (8.0-12.0) vs. 9.0 (7.0-11.0), P=0.002] and bulbar symptoms [3.0 (1.0-5.0) vs. 2.0 (0-4.0), P=0.003] as measured by the Index of Post-polio Sequelae scale. Knowledge related to post-polio syndrome also significantly increased [14.0 (11.0-16.0) vs. 17.0 (16.0-19.0), P=0.001]. Participants were able to walk at a faster speed over 10 meters [0.77 (0.59-1.00) vs. 0.83 (0.67-1.10) m/s, P=0.003] and walked longer distances during the 2-minute walk test [76.9 (31.7) vs. 82.0 (38.4) m, P=0.029]. Depression and anxiety scores did not change over time [PHQ-9, 2.0 (0.3-10.8) vs. 2.0 (0.3-6.8), P=0.450; GAD-7, 2.0 (0-7.0) vs. 1.0 (0-3.0), P=0.460] nor was there change in self-reported quality of life {60 [50-70] vs. 60 [55-70], P=0.200}. Conclusions This study suggests that a post-polio syndrome self-management programme led to improvement in symptoms, knowledge and walking speed, but not quality of life.

The higher incidence of exacerbations in winter has important consequences for patients in terms of increased morbidity and mortality. The seasonality also imposes a considerable burden on already-overloaded health care services, with both primary care consultations and hospital admissions increasing in number. The seasonality of exacerbations varies with latitude, and is greater in more temperate climates, where there may be less protection from outdoor and indoor cold exposure. The precise causes of the seasonality are unknown, but thought to be partly due to the increased prevalence of respiratory viral infections circulating in cold, damp conditions. Increased susceptibility to viral infection may also be a mechanism mediated through increased airway inflammation or possibly reduced vitamin D levels. The seasonality of exacerbations informs us about the triggers of exacerbations and suggests possible strategies to reduce their number.","Donaldson, Gavin C; Wedzicha, Jadwiga A",International journal of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,572,33

DESIGN Computerized retrospective review of single surgeon case series. SETTING Tertiary children's medical center. METHODS Children with sleep study proven obstructive sleep apnea or children under the age of 3 years with clinically suspected obstructive sleep apnea were treated according to a protocol that included: (1) rapid bloodless tonsillectomy; (2) repeated release of the tonsillar retractor; (3) avoidance of uvular edema; (4) routine intra-operative intranasal oxymetazoline, and placement of nasal airway; (5) extended recovery room observation. Primary outcome measures were (1) avoidance of unexpected intensive care unit admission; (2) post-extubation pulmonary edema; (3) aspiration pneumonia. RESULTS During the period March 2004-August 2007, 864 children underwent adenotonsillectomy by a single surgeon-604 for the indication of obstructive sleep apnea or adenotonsillar hypertrophy with obstruction. Two hundred and ten were under the age of 3 years or had sleep study proven obstructive sleep apnea. There were two unexpected admissions to the pediatric intensive care unit for persistent upper airway obstruction-none required intubation. No child developed post-obstructive pulmonary edema. Three children were treated for infiltrates consistent with aspiration pneumonitis. CONCLUSION Most cases of post-extubation pulmonary edema and pneumonia can be avoided in young children and those with mild-to-moderate obstructive sleep apnea following a protocol that anticipates and avoids precipitating causes of upper airway obstruction.","Isaacson, Glenn",International journal of pediatric otorhinolaryngology,572,31

In small cell lung cancer (SCLC), however, inflammation scores are less studied. In the present study, we set out to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis investigating reported associations between inflammation scores and overall survival (OS) in SCLC. METHODS A literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Of the identified publications, only studies in English containing original data evaluating inflammation scores as a prognostic factor in SCLC patients were included. Hazard ratios (HRs) for OS were pooled in a random-effects model. RESULTS In total, 33 articles were included evaluating eight different inflammation scores in 7762 SCLC patients. Seven of the identified scores were based on leucocyte count. Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte (PLR) ratio were the most frequently evaluated scores (NLR: n = 23; PLR: n = 22). For NLR, a meta-analysis including 16 studies demonstrated that patients with a high NLR had a significantly shorter OS compared to patients with a low NLR (pooled HR = 1.39 (95% CI, 1.23-1.56)). For PLR, an association with survival could not be confirmed in a meta-analysis performed based on eight studies (pooled HR = 1.20 (95% CI, 0.96-1.51)). CONCLUSIONS This review identifies that inflammation scores based on general inflammation markers have some potential as prognostic biomarkers in SCLC. The meta-analyses indicated that NLR is associated with inferior OS, whereas an association between PLR and OS could not be confirmed. Thus, NLR could be a useful biomarker of OS in SCLC patients.

SETTING Single-center, multihospital. PATIENTS Consecutive coronavirus disease 2019 patients who experienced in-hospital cardiac arrest with attempted resuscitation. INTERVENTIONS Attempted resuscitation with advanced cardiac life support. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS Out of 1,094 patients hospitalized for coronavirus disease 2019 during the study period, 63 patients suffered from in-hospital cardiac arrest with attempted resuscitation and were included in this study. The median age was 66 years, and 49.2% were males. The majority of patients were African Americans (90.5%). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (88.9%), obesity (69.8%), diabetes (60.3%), and chronic kidney disease (33.3%). Eighteen patients (28.9%) had a Charlson Comorbidity Index of 0-2. The most common presenting symptoms were shortness of breath (63.5%), fever (52.4%), and cough (46%). The median duration of symptoms prior to admission was 14 days. During hospital course, 66.7% patients developed septic shock, and 84.1% had acute respiratory distress syndrome. Prior to in-hospital cardiac arrest, 81% were on ventilator, 60.3% were on vasopressors, and 39.7% were on dialysis. The majority of in-hospital cardiac arrest (84.1%) occurred in the ICU. Time to initiation of advanced cardiac life support protocol was less than 1 minute for all in-hospital cardiac arrest in the ICU and less than 2 minutes for the remaining patients. The most common initial rhythms were pulseless electrical activity (58.7%) and asystole (33.3%). Although return of spontaneous circulation was achieved in 29% patients, it was brief in all of them. The in-hospital mortality was 100%.

Therefore, we analyzed clinical characteristics and laboratory data of ICU patients to identify risk factors associated with COVID-19 death. Methods Patients with COVID-19 from the ICU in the Sino-French New City Branch of Tongji Hospital Wuhan, China, between February 4 and February 29, 2020, were enrolled in this study. The final date of follow-up was April 4, 2020. Clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, treatment, and outcome of participants before and during the ICU stay were retrospectively collected and analyzed. Results A total of 92 patients were admitted or transferred to the ICU from February 4 to February 29, 2020. Compared to survivors, the majority of non-survivors (73.8%) presented with dyspnea. A random forest classifier and ROC curve were used to develop a predictive model. IL-6, D-dimer, lymphocytes, and albumin achieved good performance with AUCs of 0.9476, 0.9165, 0.8994, and 0.9251, respectively, which were consistent with clinical observations, such as inflammation, lymphopenia, and coagulation dysfunction. Combining IL-6 and D-dimer improved the performance of this model with an excellent AUC (0.997). Conclusions Mortality in COVID-19 was not rare in critically ill patients. The model that combined IL-6 and D-dimer was valuable for predicting the mortality of patients with COVID-19 with excellent performance. This model needs to be further optimized by adding more indicators and then evaluated with a multicenter study.","Chen, Yu; Liu, Zhengyin; Li, Xiaogang; Zhao, Jing; Wu, Dong; Xiao, Meng; Zhang, Dong; Gao, Peng; Tian, Ran; Xie, Jing; Fan, Siyuan; Li, Binbin; Xu, Yingchun; Li, Yongzhe; Zhang, Shuyang",Annals of translational medicine,572,32

Scientists around the world are working on the vaccine; however, an effective cure is yet to be developed. AIMS Search to be made on some alternative antiviral components from the rich sources of traditional herbal medicine in India as well as in the PRC. Here we discuss them with references. METHODS The knowledge gained from the literature search of antiviral known herbal products or Ayurvedic medicines that used to be applied against any viral or bacterial infections in the past, may be considered for deployment against COVID-19, and may be rewarded. RESULTS Many medicinal compounds are extracted from plants and have led to drug discovery. Similarly, plant products and their analogues have been employed as an early line of defense against COVID-19. CONCLUSION Research into ethnobotany, phytochemistry, plant physiology and ecology may be important in protecting the global population from current and future pandemics.","Guha, Smita; Chakraborty, Ashok",Nutrition and health,572,28

METHODS Using star platform of questionnaire, the staff in the general hospital were investigated via Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS-21), Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS) and Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ). The influential factors were discussed by descriptive analysis, rank sum test, single factor analysis, correlation analysis and multiple factors binary logistic regression analysis. RESULTS A total of 2 060 valid questionnaires were collected. The negative emotions of nurses and cleaners were the most obvious. The depression scores, anxiety scores and stress scores for nurses and cleaners were 5.06±7.47, 6.36±7.84, 9.75±8.65, and 6.72±8.84, 4.51±6.56, 9.69±9.56, respectively. Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis showed that staff types, education levels, job status, economic situation and concerns on the supplies of protective goods were the main influential factors for depression; staff types, contacting status with infected patients, economic situation, concerns on the supplies of protective goods, history of disease were the main influential factors for anxiety; contacting status with infected patients, economic situation, concerns on the supplies of protective goods were the main influential factors for stress. CONCLUSIONS There are differences in psychological characteristics among different groups of staff in the general hospital under the outbreak. Thus psychological protection and intervention measures should be formulated according to different groups and work status.","Jiang, Furong; Liu, Siyu; Zhao, Nan; Xie, Yanhui; Wang, Shuhong; Ouyang, Xinbo; Guo, Feng; Gong, Zhicheng; Zhou, Qiuhong; Li, Jianling",Zhong nan da xue xue bao.

Study Design We conducted a cell-phone survey July-November, 2016. Women aged 18-49 years living in Puerto Rico were eligible. We completed 3,059 interviews; the overall response rate was 69.2%. After weighting, the data provide population-based estimates. For this analysis, we included women at risk for unintended pregnancy, and assessed ongoing or potential need for contraceptive services in this group, excluding women using permanent contraceptive methods. RESULTS Most women reported using contraception (82.8%), and use increased with age. Female sterilization and male condoms were most frequently reported (40.8% and 17.1%, respectively). Among women with ongoing or potential need for contraceptive services, 24.7% talked to a healthcare provider about ZIKV, and 31.2% reported a change in childbearing intentions due to ZIKV. Most women were at least a little worried about getting infected with ZIKV (74.3%) or having a baby with a birth defect (80.9%). Being very worried about getting infected with ZIKV and already having Zika were significantly associated with use of any contraception (adjusted prevalence ratio: 1.19, 95% CI: 1.03-1.38 and 1.32, 95% CI: 1.01-1.72, respectively). CONCLUSIONS These findings underscore the need for regular contraceptive prevalence studies to inform programs about contraceptive needs, especially during public health emergencies. IMPLICATIONS When the 2016 Zika virus outbreak began in Puerto Rico there were no recent population-based data available on contraceptive prevalence. To fill this information gap, we conducted a population-based survey. Our findings provided baseline contraceptive prevalence estimates to support response planning and allocation of health resources.","Ellington, Sascha R; Serrano Rodriguez, Ruby; Goldberg, Howard; Bertolli, Jeanne; Simeone, Regina; Soto Mercado, Amilcar; Pazol, Karen; Jamieson, Denise J; Honein, Margaret A; Swartzendruber, Andrea; Miles, Toni; Cordero, Jose; Shapiro-Mendoza, Carrie",Contraception,572,1

Thus, there is a need to alleviate the Pb toxicity in plants for good quality food production especially from marginal soils. In this study, the effects of silicon nanoparticles (Si NPs) were investigated on coriander (Coriandrum sativum L.) biomass, vitamin C, flavonoid, antioxidant enzyme activities (i.e., catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), and super oxide dismutase (SOD)), malondialdehyde (MDA), and Pb concentration in plants subjected to different Pb concentrations. Treatments included four levels of Pb (0, 500, 1000, and 1500 mg/kg of soil), and two levels of Si NPs (0 and 1.5 mM) in all combinations. The Pb treatments alone decreased the plant biomass and vitamin C while increased the flavonoid, MDA, antioxidant enzyme activities, and Pb concentration in tissues depending upon the Pb treatments. The foliar-applied 1.5 mM Si NPs alleviated the adverse impacts of Pb on coriander plants which were due to the minimization of Pb concentration in plants and improvements in the plant defense system. Si NPs minimized accumulation of MDA in plant tissues and adjusted the activities of POD, CAT, and SOD in plants under Pb stress. Overall, Si NP foliar application might be a suitable approach in reducing the Pb concentrations in plants. However, field studies with various plant species and environmental conditions are required to highlight the role of Si NPs on the plant under toxic trace element stress.","Fatemi, Hamideh; Esmaiel Pour, Behrooz; Rizwan, Muhammad",Environmental science and pollution research international,572,16

Methodology A narrative chronological account of events after declaring an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 among HCWs. As part of the investigations, HCWs were offered testing during the outbreak. These were: (1) screening by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT- PCR) to detect a current infection; and (2) serum samples to determine seroprevalence. Results Over 180 HCWs were tested by real-time RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The rate of infection was 15.2% (23.7% for clinical or directly patient-facing HCWs vs. 4.8% in non-clinical non-patient-facing HCWs). Of the infected HCWs, 57% were asymptomatic. Seroprevalence (SARS-CoV-2 IgG) among HCWs was 13%. It was challenging to establish an exact source for the outbreak. The importance of education, training, social distancing and infection prevention practices were emphasised. Additionally, avoidance of unnecessary transfer of patients and minimising cross-site working for staff and early escalation were highlighted. Establishing mass and regular screening for HCWs are also crucial to enabling the best care for patients while maintaining the wellbeing of staff.

In fact, a large proportion of islet-infiltrating B lymphocytes in the NOD mouse model of T1D produce Abs directed against the neuronal type III intermediate filament protein peripherin. NOD-PerIg mice are a previously developed BCR-transgenic model in which virtually all B lymphocytes express the H and L chain Ig molecules from the intra-islet-derived anti-peripherin-reactive hybridoma H280. NOD-PerIg mice have accelerated T1D development, and PerIg B lymphocytes actively proliferate within islets and expand cognitively interactive pathogenic T cells from a pool of naive precursors. We now report adoptively transferred T cells or whole splenocytes from NOD-PerIg mice expectedly induce T1D in NOD.scid recipients but, depending on the kinetics of disease development, can also elicit a peripheral neuritis (with secondary myositis). This neuritis was predominantly composed of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Ab depletion studies showed neuritis still developed in the absence of NOD-PerIg CD8+ T cells but required CD4+ T cells. Surprisingly, sciatic nerve-infiltrating CD4+ cells had an expansion of IFN-γ- and TNF-α- double-negative cells compared with those within both islets and spleen. Nerve and islet-infiltrating CD4+ T cells also differed by expression patterns of CD95, PD-1, and Tim-3. Further studies found transitory early B lymphocyte depletion delayed T1D onset in a portion of NOD-PerIg mice, allowing them to survive long enough to develop neuritis outside of the transfer setting. Together, this study presents a new model of peripherin-reactive B lymphocyte-dependent autoimmune neuritis.","Racine, Jeremy J; Chapman, Harold D; Doty, Rosalinda; Cairns, Brynn M; Hines, Timothy J; Tadenev, Abigail L D; Anderson, Laura C; Green, Torrian; Dyer, Meaghan E; Wotton, Janine M; Bichler, Zoë; White, Jacqueline K; Ettinger, Rachel; Burgess, Robert W; Serreze, David V",Journal of immunology,572,8

Using known 3D structures of close homologs, we created seven homology models. We also identified a set of serine protease inhibitor drugs, generated several conformations of each, and docked them into our models. We used three known chemical (non-drug) inhibitors and one validated inhibitor of TMPRSS2 in MERS as benchmark compounds and found six compounds with predicted high binding affinity in the range of the known inhibitors. We also showed that a previously published weak inhibitor, Camostat, had a significantly lower binding score than our six compounds.

METHODOLOGY We performed a genetic evolution analysis of the S1 gene of endemic PEDV strains in Eastern China. The S1 genes of 37 PEDV-positive samples were amplified and sequenced, and compared to the standard CV777 strain, 120 nucleotides were found to have mutations. RESULTS The nucleotide and deduced amino acid homologies between the sequences and those of the CV777 strain were 90%-91% and 88.2%-90%, respectively, and their homologies to the vaccine strain were 88.6%-89.7% and 86.2%-87.8%, respectively. Genetic evolution and variation analyses indicated that the 37 PEDV strains belonged to genogroup 2-1, while the CV777 strain, vaccine strain, and earlier Chinese strains all belonged to genogroup 1-1.

Moreover, the robot-assisted technology has been shown to reduce the surgeon's stress load compared to standard single-incision laparoscopy in an experimental setup, suggesting an important advantage of the da Vinci platform. However, the above-mentioned observations are based solely on case series, case reports and experimental data, as high-quality clinical trials to demonstrate the benefits of the da Vinci Single-Site™ cholecystectomy have not been performed to date. METHODS This study addresses the question whether robot-assisted Single-Site™ cholecystectomy provides significant benefits over single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy in terms of surgeon's stress load, while matching the standards of the conventional single-incision approach with regard to peri- and postoperative outcomes. It is designed as a single centre, single-blinded randomized controlled trial, which compares both surgical approaches with the primary endpoint surgeon's physical and mental stress load at the time of surgery. In addition, the study aims to assess secondary endpoints such as operating time, conversion rates, additional trocar placement, intra-operative blood loss, length of hospital stay, costs of procedure, health-related quality of life, cosmesis and complications. Patients as well as ward staff are blinded until the 1st postoperative year. Sample size calculation based on the results of a previously published experimental setup utilizing an estimated effect size of surgeon's comfort of 0.8 (power of 0.8, alpha-error level of 0.05, error margin of 10-15%) resulted in a number of 30 randomized patients per arm.

RNA viruses are routinely exchanged between humans and other hosts (particularly other mammals and sometimes birds) over both epidemiological and evolutionary time: 89% of human-infective species are considered zoonotic and many of the remainder have zoonotic origins. Some viruses that have crossed the species barrier into humans have persisted and become human-adapted viruses, as exemplified by the emergence of HIV-1. Most, however, have remained as zoonoses, and a substantial number have apparently disappeared again. We still know relatively little about what determines whether a virus is able to infect, transmit from, and cause disease in humans, but there is evidence that factors such as host range, cell receptor usage, tissue tropisms, and transmission route all play a role. Although systematic surveillance for potential new human viruses in nonhuman hosts would be enormously challenging, we can reasonably aspire to much better knowledge of the diversity of mammalian and avian RNA viruses than exists at present.","J Woolhouse, Mark E; Adair, Kyle; Brierley, Liam",Microbiology spectrum,572,27

The Chicago classification is subsequently applied to interpret the manometric findings and facilitate a diagnosis of esophageal motility disorders. This review will discuss new insights regarding the diagnosis and management using the Chicago classification. RECENT FINDINGS Recent studies have demonstrated that high-resolution manometry is superior to conventional manometry, and has a higher sensitivity to diagnose achalasia. Furthermore, the subclassification of achalasia as used in the Chicago classification has prognostic value and can be used to direct treatment. Diagnosis of esophageal spasm has been improved by using the distal latency as diagnostic criterion. Recently, criteria for minor disorders of peristalsis have been sharpened, leading to a lower rate of patients with abnormal results, thereby increasing the relevance of a diagnosis. High-resolution manometry is now considered the gold standard for diagnosis of esophageal motility disorders. The Chicago classification provides a standardized approach for analysis and categorization of abnormalities that has led to a significant increase in our knowledge regarding the diagnosis and management of motility disorders. Further refinement of the classification will be required.","Rohof, W O A; Bredenoord, A J",Current gastroenterology reports,572,1

Massive research efforts have been made in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Utilization of clinical data can accelerate these research efforts to fight against the pandemic since important characteristics of the patients are often found by examining the clinical data. Publicly accessible clinical data on COVID-19, however, remain limited despite the immediate need. OBJECTIVE To provide shareable clinical data to catalyze COVID-19 research, we present Columbia Open Health Data for COVID-19 Research (COHD-COVID), a publicly accessible database providing clinical concept prevalence, clinical concept co-occurrence, and clinical symptom prevalence for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. COHD-COVID also provides data on hospitalized influenza patients and general hospitalized patients as comparator cohorts. METHODS The data used in COHD-COVID were obtained from NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center's electronic health records database. Condition, drug, and procedure concepts were obtained from the visits of identified patients from the cohorts. Rare concepts were excluded and the true concept counts were perturbed using Poisson randomization to protect patient privacy. Concept prevalence, concept prevalence ratio, concept co-occurrence, and symptom prevalence were calculated using the obtained concepts. RESULTS Concept prevalence and concept prevalence ratio analyses showed clinical characteristics of COVID-19 cohorts, confirming well-known conditions of COVID-19 (e.g., acute lower respiratory tract infection and cough) recorded high prevalence and high prevalence ratio in the COVID-19 cohort compared to the hospitalized influenza cohort and general hospitalized cohort. Concept co-occurrence analyses showed potential associations between specific concepts. In case of acute lower respiratory tract infection in the COVID-19 cohort, it showed high co-occurrence ratio with COVID-19 related concepts and commonly used drugs (e.g., disease due to coronavirus and acetaminophen). Symptom prevalence analysis indicated symptom-level characteristics of the cohorts confirming that well-known symptoms of COVID-19 (e.g., fever, cough, and dyspnea) showed higher prevalence than the hospitalized influenza cohort and general hospitalized cohort. CONCLUSIONS We present COHD-COVID, a publicly accessible database providing useful clinical data for hospitalized COVID-19 patients, hospitalized influenza patients, and general hospitalized patients. We expect COHD-COVID will provide researchers and clinicians quantitative measures of COVID-19 related clinical features to better understand and fight against the pandemic.

However, due to the performance deterioration over time, its robustness and reliability appear not sufficient to allow a non-expert to use outside laboratory. It would be thus helpful to study what happens behind the decreasing tendency of the BCI performance. This paper explores the changes of brain networks and electrooculography (EOG) signals to investigate the cognitive capability changes along the use of the SSVEP-based BCI. The EOG signals are characterized by the blink amplitudes and the speeds of saccades, and the brain networks are estimated by the instantaneous phase synchronizations of electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Experimental results revealed that the characteristics derived from EOG and brain networks have similar trends which contain two stages. At the beginning, the blink amplitudes and the saccade speeds start to reduce. Meanwhile, the global synchronizations of the brain networks are formed quickly.

To prevent COVID-19 infection, all teaching at Suzuka University of Medical Sciences from April to June 2020 took place as remote lectures, not in the face-to-face format. This study analyzes post-lecture questionnaire responses regarding face-to-face and remote teaching in the subject of Nuclear Medicine Examination Technology. We examine the educational effect of using remote lectures. Methods: We conducted a questionnaire survey among students by means of a five-point evaluation scale about satisfaction, comprehension, concentration, preparation, reviewing, and the question environment for face-to-face and remote lectures. Results: We present the results as means and standard deviations. Satisfaction results for face-to-face and remote lectures were 3.30 ± 0.72 and 3.36 ± 0.88, respectively. Comprehension results for face-to-face and remote lectures were 3.30 ± 0.71 and 3.30 ± 0.83, respectively. Concentration results for face-to-face and remote lectures were 3.50 ± 0.69 and 3.05 ± 0.90, respectively. The preparation results for face-to-face and remote lectures were 2.57 ± 0.88 and 2.67 ± 0.94, respectively. The reviewing results for face-to-face and remote lectures were 2.84 ± 0.85 and 3.39 ± 0.89, respectively. The question environment results for face-to-face and remote lectures lessons were 2.94 ± 0.90 and 3.43 ± 0.84, respectively. There were no significant differences between face-to-face and remote lectures in terms of satisfaction, comprehension, and preparation. There were significant differences between face-to-face and remote lectures in terms of concentration, reviewing, and the questioning environment (P < 0.001). Conclusion: This comparative analysis of the post-lecture questionnaire responses for face-to-face and remote formats in Nuclear Medicine Examination Technology showed that remote lectures have a strong educational effect.

We compared the outcomes of stapled sigmoid augmentation with standard sutured colocystoplasty. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between 2003 and 2011, 108 children underwent bladder augmentation at our institution. Colocystoplasty was used in 30 patients (27.8%). Medical charts of children who underwent stapled (n = 8) or sutured (n = 22) sigmoid augmentation were compared with regard to patient demographics and surgical complications, including anastomotic leak and urolithiasis. RESULTS Eight children with underwent stapled sigmoid colocystoplasty. Average age at surgery was 8 years (range 4-17 years). Time to detubularize and refashion the bowel segment prior to augmentation was consistently under 5 min. Average length of follow-up was 44 months (range 12-80 months). One patient experienced anastomotic leak. Two of eight children (25%) in the stapled anastomosis cohort developed bladder stones. Twenty-two patients underwent standard sigmoid augmentation during the same time period (average age 8.2 years; range 4-16 years). One of 22 (4.5%) experienced anastomotic leak. Seven of 22 (31.8%) developed cystolithiasis. CONCLUSIONS Complications from stapled sigmoid anastomosis are similar to those from standard colocystoplasty. Use of absorbable staples decreases operating time by avoiding bowel spatulation and suturing, and should be considered in pediatric patients undergoing colocystoplasty.","Arlen, Angela M; Merriman, Laura S; Elmore, James M; Smith, Edwin A; Kirsch, Andrew J",Journal of pediatric urology,572,33

On a more hopeful note, the pandemic has also revealed that policymakers and bureaucrats, reputed as defenders of the status quo and glacially paced, are capable of moving nimbly when seized with necessity. This manuscript draws on Baumgartner and Jones' punctuated-equilibrium theory to analyze and demonstrate how policy responses to the pandemic, largely in Canada but also globally, were shaped by preexisting problems (periods of equilibrium). It then raises the question: Will future policy reflect lessons learned through COVID-19, to not only mitigate risks from further crises, but also tackle many other policy challenges?

Severe RNA virus respiratory infections often correlate with high viral load and excessive inflammation. Understanding the dynamics of the innate immune response and its manifestation at the cell and tissue levels are vital to understanding the mechanisms of immunopathology and developing improved, strain independent treatments. Here, we present a novel spatialized multicellular spatial computational model of two principal components of tissue infection and response: RNA virus replication and type-I interferon mediated antiviral response to infection within lung epithelial cells. The model is parameterized using data from influenza virus infected cell cultures and, consistent with experimental observations, exhibits either linear radial growth of viral plaques or arrested plaque growth depending on the local concentration of type I interferons. Modulating the phosphorylation of STAT or altering the ratio of the diffusion constants of interferon and virus in the cell culture could lead to plaque growth arrest. The dependence of arrest on diffusion constants highlights the importance of developing validated spatial models of cytokine signaling and the need for in vitro experiments to measure these diffusion constants. Sensitivity analyses were performed under conditions creating both continuous plaque growth and arrested plaque growth. Findings suggest that plaque growth and cytokine assay measurements should be collected during arrested plaque growth, as the model parameters are significantly more sensitive and more likely to be identifiable. The model’s metrics replicate experimental immunostaining imaging and titer based sampling assays. The model is easy to extend to include SARS-CoV-2-specific mechanisms as they are discovered or to include as a component linking epithelial cell signaling to systemic immune models. Author Summary COVID-19 is possibly the defining healthcare crisis of the current generation, with tens of millions of global cases and more than a million reported deaths. Respiratory lung infections form lesions in the lungs, whose number and size correlate with severity of illness. In some severe cases, the disease triggers a severe inflammatory condition known as cytokine storm. Given the complexity of the immune system, computational modeling is needed to link molecular signaling at the site of inflection to the signaling impact on the overall immune system, ultimately revealing how severe inflammatory conditions may emerge. Here, we created a computational model of the early stages of infection that simulates lung cells infected with RNA viruses, such those responsible for COVID-19 and influenza, to help explore how the disease forms viral plaques, an in vitro analog to lesion growth in the lung. Our model recapitulates in vitro observations that pretreatment of biological signaling molecules called with type-I interferons, which are currently being evaluated for treatment of COVID-19. Analyzing the model, we, can stop viral plaque growth. We found that enhancing certain aspects of the innate immune system, such as the JAK/STAT pathway, may be able to stop viral plaque growth, suggesting molecules involved in this pathway as possible drug candidates. Quantifying the parameters needed to model interferon signaling and viral replication, experiments should be performed under conditions that inhibit viral growth, such as pretreating cells with interferon. We present a computational framework that is essential to constructing larger models of respiratory infection induced immune responses, can be used to evaluate drugs and other medical interventions quickly, cheaply, and without the need for animal testing during the initial phase, and that defines experiments needed to improve our fundamental understanding of the mechanisms regulating the immune response.","Aponte-Serrano, Josua O.; Weaver, Jordan J.A.; Sego, T.J.; Glazier, James A.; Shoemaker, Jason E.",bioRxiv,572,1

We undertook a comprehensive mixed methods study in order to examine the barriers and enablers to influenza vaccination in patients with chronic respiratory conditions. Methods: Mixed methods including a survey (n=429) which assessed socio-demographics and the psychological factors associated with vaccine uptake (i.e. confidence, complacency, constraints, calculation and collective responsibility) with binary logistic regression analysis. We also undertook focus groups and interviews (n=59) to further explore barriers and enablers to uptake using thematic analysis. Results: The survey analysis identified that older participants were more likely to accept the vaccine, as were those with higher perceptions of collective responsibility around vaccination, lower levels of complacency, and lower levels of constraints. Thematic analysis showed that concerns over vaccine side effects, lack of tailored information and knowledge, and a lack of trust and rapport with healthcare professionals were key barriers. In contrast, the importance of feeling protected, acceptance of being part of an at-risk group, and feeling a reduced sense of vulnerability after vaccination were seen as key enablers. Conclusions: Our findings showed that the decision to accept a vaccine against influenza is influenced by multiple sociodemographic and psychological factors. Future interventions should provide clear and transparent information about side effects and be tailored to patients with chronic respiratory conditions. Interactions between patients and their healthcare providers have a particularly important role to play in helping patients address their concerns and feel confident in vaccination.","Williams, L.; Deakin, K.; Gallant, A.; Rasmussen, S.; Young, D.; Cogan, N.",,572,1

A proportionality test is conducted in order to determine whether the degree of infringement of the human rights implicated is balanced by the potential of a certification system to mitigate the risks of the virus. The results from this analysis show that the targeted aims can be achieved through already existing measures with a lesser impact on civil and fundamental human rights. Moreover, in a context of uncertainty around the immunopathology of COVID-19, the introduction of these certificates presents ethical and scientific challenges, which lead us to believe that this measure is unlikely to play a central role in stopping the spread of the disease, and it could set the pace for a dangerous precedent, allowing for extensive discrimination and exacerbating already existing inequalities and disparities. © 2021 The Author(s).

Since its first report, SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in a global pandemic, with over 10 million human infections and over 560,000 deaths reported worldwide at the end of June 2020. Currently, there are no United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved vaccines and/or antivirals licensed against SARS-CoV-2, and the high economical and health impact of SARS-CoV-2 has placed global pressure on the scientific community to identify effective prophylactic and therapeutic treatments for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated COVID-19 disease. While some compounds have been already reported to reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection and a handful of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been described that neutralize SARS-CoV-2, there is an urgent need for the development and standardization of assays which can be used in high through-put screening (HTS) settings to identify new antivirals and/or neutralizing mAbs against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we described a rapid, accurate and highly reproducible plaque reduction microneutralization (PRMNT) assay that can be quickly adapted for the identification and characterization of both neutralizing mAbs and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.

Clonal Mast Cells Activation Disorders (cMCADs) such as mastocytosis and clonal mast cells activation syndrome are characterized by an abnormal mast cells accumulation and/or activation. No data have been published on the anti-viral immune response of patients with cMCADs. The aims of the study were to collected, in a comprehensive way, outcomes of cMCADs patients who experienced a biologically-proven COVID-19 and to characterize both anti-endemic coronaviruses and specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune responses in these patients. Clinical follow-up and outcome data were collected prospectively for one year within the French rare disease network CEREMAST encompassing patients from all over the country. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 and anti-endemic coronaviruses specific T-cells were assessed with an enzyme-linked immunospot assay (EliSpot) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 humoral response with dosage of circulating levels of specific IgG, IgA and neutralizing antibodies. Overall, 32 cMCADs patients were identified. None of them required non-invasive or mechanical ventilation; two patients were hospitalized to receive oxygen and steroid therapy. In 21 patients, a characterization of the SARS-CoV-2-specific immune response has been performed. A majority of patients showed a high proportion of circulating SARS-CoV-2-specific interferon (IFN)-γ producing T-cells and high levels of anti-Spike IgG antibodies with neutralizing activity. In addition, no defects in anti-endemic coronaviruses responses were found in patients with cMCADs compared to non-cMCADs controls. Patients with cMCADs frequently showed a spontaneous IFN-γ T-cell production in absence of any stimulation that correlated with circulating basal tryptase levels, a marker of mast cells burden. These findings underscore that patients with cMCADs might be not at risk of severe COVID-19 and the spontaneous IFN-γ production might explain this observation. Author Summary Mast cells are immune cells involved in many biological processes including the anti-microbial response. However, previous studies suggest that mast cells may have a detrimental role in the response against viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, responsible for COVID-19. When a mutation occurs in mast cells, it can lead to a group of diseases called clonal mast cells activation disorders (cMCADs), characterized by deregulated activation of these cells. Hence, patients with cMCADs might be more susceptible to severe COVID-19 than general population. We therefore conducted a 1-year study in France to collect data from all cMCADs patients included in the CEREMAST rare disease French network and who experienced COVID-19. Interestingly, we did not find any severe COVID-19 (i.e. requiring non-invasive or mechanical ventilation) in spite of well-known risk factors for severe COVID-19 in a part of cMCADs patients. We then have studied the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 and other endemic coronaviruses in these patients. We did not observe any abnormalities in the immune response either at the level of T and B lymphocytes. These findings underscore that these patients might not be at risk of severe COVID-19 as one might have feared.","Rossignol, Julien; Ouedrani, Amani; Livideanu, Cristina Bulai; Barete, Stéphane; Terriou, Louis; Launay, David; Lemal, Richard; Greco, Celine; Frenzel, Laurent; Meni, Cecile; Bodemere-Skandalis, Christine; Polivka, Laura; Collange, Anne-Florence; Hachichi, Hassiba; Bouzourine, Sonia; Messaoud, Djazira Nait; Negretto, Mathilde; Vendrame, Laurence; Jambou, Marguerite; Gousseff, Marie; Durupt, Stéphane; Lega, Jean-Christophe; Durand, Jean-Marc; Gaudy, Caroline; Damaj, Gandhi; Gourin, Marie-Pierre; Hamidou, Mohamed; Bouillet, Laurence; Le Mouel, Edwige; Maria, Alexandre; Zunic, Patricia; Cabrera, Quentin; Vincent, Denis; Lavigne, Christian; Riviere, Etienne; Gourguechon, Clement; Brignier, Anne; Lhermitte, Ludovic; Molina, Thierry Jo; Bruneau, Julie; Agopian, Julie; Dubreuil, Patrice; Ranta, Dana; Mania, Alexandre; Arock, Michel; Staropoli, Isabelle; Tournilhac, Olivier; Lortholary, Olivier; Schwartz, Olivier; Chatenoud, Lucienne; Hermine, Olivier",bioRxiv,572,24

This perspective paper aims to add to the knowledge already produced on this topic, by arguing that these challenging conditions can be a pivotal moment of opportunity for reshaping higher education, with the implementation, development and diffusion, among academics and students, of digital technologies. The paper also discusses the role of leadership in the transformation of organizational culture in higher education. The methodology used to carry out this study is qualitative, and the technique employed to analyze the data collected was content analysis. Research studies, in diverse formats, already published on the COVID-19 topic and its impacts were the elected data sources. The results of this document analysis allow us to conclude that there is the need to improve the digital sustainable development in teaching in higher education, which entails profound challenges that higher education institutions need to face and overcome if they want to be at the forefront of success in the international education market. This is where the authors seek to contribute, by offering insights on the challenges—but also the opportunities—that COVID-19 poses to higher education at a time when it needs to redefine its teaching methods, leadership models, and interaction channels, by going digital towards the improvement of the sustainable development of its teaching.","Sá, Maria José Serpa Sandro",Sustainability,572,16

The companion, HD 33632 Ab, induces a 10.5$\sigma$ astrometric acceleration on the star as detected with the $Gaia$ and $Hipparcos$ satellites. SCExAO/CHARIS $JHK$ (1.1--2.4 $\mu$m) spectra and Keck/NIRC2 $L_{\rm p}$ (3.78 $\mu$m) photometry are best matched by a field L/T transition object: an older, higher gravity, and less dusty counterpart to HR 8799 cde. Combining our astrometry with $Gaia/Hipparcos$ data and archival Lick Observatory radial-velocities, we measure a dynamical mass of 46.4 $\pm$ 8 $M_{\rm J}$ and an eccentricity of $e$ $<$0.46 at 95\% confidence. HD 33632 Ab's mass and mass ratio (4.0\% $\pm$ 0.7\%) are comparable to the low-mass brown dwarf GJ 758 B and intermediate between the more massive brown dwarf HD 19467 B and the (near-)planet mass companions to HR 2562 and GJ 504.

It utilizes tools from the Systems Thinking field, including stakeholder analysis, shaping force analysis, a conceptagon triple, causal loop diagrams, and systemigrams to provide insights into the problem space facing Disney theme parks. This analysis reveals aspects of the problem that need to be considered when evaluating potential solutions to interim and long-term challenges presented. It points out the natural boost that the pandemic gave to Disney's streaming service, Disney+, and it explores ways to mimic that phenomenon to provide increased opportunities for the company. It highlights the importance of group experience to theme parks and the prominent role that destination plays in the current makeup of themed entertainment experience. It concludes that design efforts are best aimed at exploring solution spaces that place emphasis on multi-generational experiences that allow connection to the Disney brand without requiring significant extra-party interaction. Augmented Reality is one technology that shows promise for addressing social distancing concerns while fostering group experiences.

Within the common institutional framework of the European Union, the outbreak has put under extreme stress governance and interplay between the national and supranational level. Under some coordination, responses have remained largely in the hands and on the shoulders of the Member States. In this context, the article classifies pandemic outbreaks and responses along the containment and fiscal support dimensions to uncover whether a common model for Covid-19 crisis management arises across the EU27 or rather different policy choices patterns emerge within the continent. Based on indicators covering the three dimensions derived from the Oxford Covid Government response tracker, the John Hopkins CSSE Covid-19 database and the European Commission Autumn Forecasts, the paper employs hierarchical cluster analysis to uncover response group across countries and characterize them by the outbreak, containment and fiscal support strengths, delineating as well the geographical distribution across and within the clusters. The findings present the heterogeneity of response models, robust to alternative specifications and timeframes across the first and the second wave, deriving broader implications for the outlook for the vaccine-roll out and exit from the crisis. The dynamics in 2020 are also considered in the context of the shortcomings of supranational governance within the EU and the current policy reform debate, highlighting the high stakes for the upcoming Conference on the Future of Europe. The contribution of the work is furthered by offering a systematic methodology and framework to study heterogeneities of pandemic responses within the EU paving the way for further analysis of contributing factors explaining decision-makers policy choices as well as performance concerning political, social and economic outcomes across the models.

This work aims to predict the naphtha column KPI parameters with high accuracy so that operators make corrective actions efficiently. Although linear regression provides acceptable results for prediction, this is not the case for top and bottom product C7 and C6 prediction in the central Naphtha Splitter column. First, we did gather all the available data to overcome this problem, which can affect the top and bottom products. Including upstream units that feed the column. Instead of one common technique (linear regression), we used five additional machine learning methods: Adaboost, support vectors, kNN, random forest, XGboosting. Since there are many measurements, however, very few samples need to reduce dimensions before modeling. We used BorutaSharp to select the essential features. We also use classification machine learning methods to categorize bottom products since there is no need to predict the value instead of whether the value is higher or lower than a constant. Overall, we achieved 30% higher accuracy than the traditional ways for the top product, and we reached to predict C6 content in the bottom with higher accuracy than 80%. Xgboost provides the best regression model, and stochastic gradient boosting yields the best classification model. After our implementation, the energy consumption is decreased significantly, and 100k$/month is saved since we can monitor top and bottom products simultaneously. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Serfidan, A.

Under certain conditions such as: (1) having a balanced set of workers with different backgrounds and cognitive abilities; (2) using an adequate set of mechanisms to control the quality of the collected data; and (3) using a coarse grained assessment scale, the crowd can provide reliable identification of fake news. However, fake news are a subtle matter: statements can be just biased (""cherrypicked""), imprecise, wrong, etc. and the unidimensional truth scale used in existing work cannot account for such differences. In this paper we propose a multidimensional notion of truthfulness and we ask the crowd workers to assess seven different dimensions of truthfulness selected based on existing literature: Correctness, Neutrality, Comprehensibility, Precision, Completeness, Speaker's Trustworthiness, and Informativeness. We deploy a set of quality control mechanisms to ensure that the thousands of assessments collected on 180 publicly available fact-checked statements distributed over two datasets are of adequate quality, including a custom search engine used by the crowd workers to find web pages supporting their truthfulness assessments. A comprehensive analysis of crowdsourced judgments shows that: (1) the crowdsourced assessments are reliable when compared to an expert-provided gold standard; (2) the proposed dimensions of truthfulness capture independent pieces of information; (3) the crowdsourcing task can be easily learned by the workers; and (4) the resulting assessments provide a useful basis for a more complete estimation of statement truthfulness.","Soprano, Michael; Roitero, Kevin; Barbera, David La; Ceolin, Davide; Spina, Damiano; Mizzaro, Stefano; Demartini, Gianluca",,572,1

A more abundant exposure to bugs and their impact can improve the situation. To test this radically new hypothesis, we developed VU-BugZoo, an interactive software testing learning platform. Built upon a repository of fault-seeded executables, the platform engages students and teachers in a dynamic bug-hunting experience. What counts the most in this game is the quality of the test strategy and fault diagnosis, rather than just the quantity of devised test cases. In this paper, we describe the VU-BugZoo web-application, developed using a stack of Vue.js and Python Flask, running in Docker containers. Next, we report on its first deployment in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, for a remote assessment of 50 graduate CS students enrolled in an introductory software testing course.

Margalef index and three-stage least-squares were employed.FindingsMajority of rice-farming households in Ghana diversify livelihoods. The extent of livelihood diversification differs among two-season rain-fed, two-season irrigated and one-season rain-fed rice-producing households. Credit, distance to district capitals, production purpose and number of farming seasons influence crop and income diversifications, and consumption expenditure of rice-producing households. While crop diversification reduces consumption expenditure, income diversification increases it. Crop and income diversifications positively influence each other. Consumption expenditure reduces crop diversification but increases income diversification.Practical implicationsPolicy should be directed towards the promotion of more livelihood activities to boost rice farmers' welfare. There should be awareness creation and training programmes to enable rice farmers realize different economic activities within and outside the agricultural value chain.Originality/valueCrop and income diversifications were measured as continuous response variables, unlike previous studies that used a binary response variable.

Controversial results have been published from clinical and observational data concerning its effectiveness.2 Ocular toxicity have been described as a serious adverse event of these antimalarial drugs and screening protocols have been displayed for its prevention.3 Objectives: To evaluate CQ/HCQ ocular toxicity and to identify potential predictors of appearance. Also to asses screening protocols compliance. Methods: Demographic, diagnostic and treatment data were collected from patients under CQ or HCQ treatment in the Clinical University Hospital in Santiago De Compostela (Spain) during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (January to April 2020). Univariable logistic regression was performed to identify potential predictors of maculopathy. Variables with p<0.20 were selected for multivariable testing. Stata 15.1 was used to perform statistical analysis. Results: 503 patients taking CQ/HCQ were identified. 495 were women. Most frequent diagnosis were SLE (48.28%), cutaneous lupus (22.85%) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA, 12.54%). Mean age at diagnosis was 44.99 years (SD 17,88). 93.33% of patients were under treatment with HCQ. Mean age at beginning of CQ/HCQ treatment was 48.10 years (SD 17.79) and mean time between diagnosis and CQ/ HCQ onset was 2.03 years (SD 5.50). Mean maximum HCQ dosage per patient was 3.83 mg/kg (SD 1,59;252.57 mg per day, SD 89.98) and CQ was 3.24 mg/kg (SD 1,91;219.49 mg per day, SD 103.90). Mean time under CQ/HCQ treatment was 6.39 years (SD 5.63). 20 patients developed maculopathy. Mean time between CQ/HCQ onset and maculopathy appearance was 2.67 years (SD 3.10). Only 25 patients did not complete ophthalmologic exams for maculopathy screening. After univariable analysis, higher age at diagnosis and age at beginning of CQ/ HCQ treatment were identified as potential predictors of maculopathy (p<0.20). After multivariable analysis, both higher age at diagnosis and higher age at CQ/ HCQ onset were identified as predictors for suffering maculopathy under treatment with CQ/HCQ (OR 1.06 [CI95% 1.03-1.10] p=0.000 and OR 1.09 [CI95% 1.02-1.16] p=0.008, respectively). Conclusion: Ocular toxicity remains as one of the most harmful and disabling adverse events in patients under CQ/HCQ treatment. Higher age at diagnosis and higher age at beginning of treatment appear to be risk factors for maculopathy appearance. Screening protocols are well-assumed by patients and seemed to be helpful for preventing and early identifying events. CQ/HCQ usage in COVID-19 patients should be individualized, specially in older patients, and protocols involving ocular toxicity should be implemented in the follow-up of this population.","Dos-Santos, R.; Fernández Fernández, D.; González Fernández, I.; Sanchez-Wonenburger, M.; Castro-Santamaria, P.; Souto Vilas, A.; Perez-Pampín, E.; Mera Varela, A.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,572,16

We address these questions by using a statistically powerful mixed-effects differential equations framework to analyze data from two human studies that follow CD8 T cell responses to the yellow fever vaccine (YFV-17D). Models were first fit to the frequency and division rates of YFV-specific memory CD8 T cells 42 days to 1 year post-vaccination. A different dataset, on the loss of YFV-specific CD8 T cells over three decades, was used to assess out of sample predictions of our models. The commonly used exponential and bi-exponential decline models performed relatively poorly. Models with the cell loss following a power law (exactly or approximately) were most predictive. Notably, using only the first year of data, these models accurately predicted T cell frequencies up to 30 years post-vaccination. Our analyses suggest that division rates of these cells drop and plateau at a low level (0.001 per day, ~double estimates for naive T cells) within one year following vaccination, whereas death rates continue to decline for much longer. Our results show that power laws can be predictive for T cell memory, a finding that may be useful for vaccine evaluation and epidemiological modeling. Moreover, since power laws asymptotically decline more slowly than any exponential decline, our results help explain the longevity of immune memory phenomenologically. Author summary Immunological memory, generated in response to infection or vaccination, may provide complete or partial protection from antigenically similar infections for the lifetime. Memory CD8 T cells are important players in protection from secondary viral infections but quantitative understanding of their dynamics in humans is limited. We analyze data from two studies where immunization with the yellow fever virus vaccine (YFV-17D) generates a mild acute infection and long-term memory. We find that: (i) the division rate of YFV-17D-specific CD8 T cells drops and stabilizes at ~ 0.1% per day during the first year following vaccination whereas the death rate declines more gradually, and (ii) the number of these cells declines approximately in accordance with a power law (∝time−0.82) for at least several decades following vaccination.","Zarnitsyna, Veronika I.; Akondy, Rama S.; Ahmed, Hasan; McGuire, Don J.; Zarnitsyn, Vladimir G.; Moore, Mia; Johnson, Philip L.

Here, an oral SARS-COV-2 RBD live vaccine containing LTB26 adjuvant has been developed. BALB/c mice are oral vaccinated with attenuated Salmonella typhimurium SL7207 containing pcDNA3.1-LTB26RBD or pcDNA3.1-RBD plasmids. The result shows that the high level of RBD specific antibody is produced in pcDNA3.1- LTB26RBD treatment. The mechanism indicates that LTB26 enhances RBD antibody production by significantly upregulating the activity of MHC II+ DCs and CD19+CD45+ B cells. LTB26 mutant is derived from heat-labile enterotoxin B subunit (LTB) wild type of Escherichia coli with enhanced immune adjuvanticity. Based on the pre-experiment result that SL7207 interferes the function of LTB26, the purified LTB26 was mixed with purified human rotavirus VP8 antigen to explore the mechanism of adjuvant. The results suggests that LTB26 enhances mucosal immune responses via increased of BCR and MHC II+ expression. Furthermore, LTB26 promotes both Th1 and Th2 cell mediated immunity. Therefore, LTB26 maybe a potent adjuvant for mucosal vaccine development in view of the safety of LTB26 than LT toxin.","Ma, Yongping; Shi, Qinlin; Wang, Qiujuan; Chen, Sijing; Gan, Sijie; Fang, Changyin; Shen, Yanxi; Jiang, Min; Lin, Tao; Song, Fangzhou",bioRxiv,572,19

Especially in schools, the duration of stay is long and the number of people in the rooms is large, increasing the risk of infection. This problem particularly affects schools without pre-installed ventilation systems that are equipped with filters and/or operate with fresh air. Here, the aerosol concentration is reduced by natural ventilation. In this context, we are investigating the effect of large mobile air purifiers (AP) with HEPA filters on particle concentration and their suitability for classroom use in a primary school in Germany. The three tested APs differ significantly in their air outlet characteristics. Measurements of the number of particles, the particle size distribution, and the CO2 concentration were carried out in the classroom with students (April/May 2021) and with an aerosol generator without students. In this regard, the use of APs leads to a substantial reduction in aerosol particles. At the same time, the three APs are found to have differences in their particle decay rate, noise level, and flow velocity. In addition to the measurements, the effect of various influencing parameters on the potential inhaled particle dose was investigated using a calculation model. The parameters considered include the duration of stay, particle concentration in exhaled air, respiratory flow rate, virus lifetime, ventilation interval, ventilation efficiency, AP volumetric flow, as well as room size. Based on the resulting effect diagrams, significant recommendations can be derived for reducing the risk of infection from virus-laden aerosols. Finally, the measurements were compared to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling, as such tools can aid the optimal placement and configuration of APs and can be used to study the effect of the spread of aerosols from a source in the classroom.","Duill, F.

However, many urban areas are densely populated and many car owners do not even have a proper car park. In such case, how will they get an access to charging facility. In this paper, we present a model of an aggregated charging facility that is located as a work-place car park. The arrival and departure of PEVs are modeled using the office statistics. We show how this random variable can be represented as an electrical load to the grid. We then show charging strategies that can be used to ensure the PEVs have a full charge at the time of departure. This is to eliminate the need for residential charging as there may not be such a facility available.

Design Cross-sectional survey. Setting Online survey. Patients or Participants FMIGS fellows, classes of 2021 and 2022. Interventions Anonymous survey including the validated Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI). Measurements and Main Results 100 FMIGS fellows were invited to participate in the study. Of the 58 fellows with complete CBI survey data, 78% were 30-34 years old, 72% were female, 50% were first year, and 50% were second year fellows. The mean CBI score was 39.0 (SD=14.6), indicating moderate burnout. 22.4% of fellows had scores over 50, indicating high burnout. Personal and work-related burnout were highest, with CBI scores of 47.6 (SD=17.0) and 44.8 (SD=17.8), respectively. Patient related burnout scores were the lowest, at 23.6 (SD=16.7). With respect to the COVID-19 pandemic, 76% reported a decrease in surgical volume, 43% were assigned to roles outside their typical scope, and 28% experienced inadequate access to personal protective equipment. Factors associated with burnout included career choice dissatisfaction (Beta=6.3, 95% CI [1.7-10.9], p=0.009), and absence of a positive and respectful work environment (Beta=6.4, 95% CI [1.6-11.1], p=0.01).

Psychosocial support is an important component of comprehensive care. Our aim was to describe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the gynecologic cancer support program at a large urban medical center. Support group data, including type (in-person vs. virtual), topic (education, support, or creative), and attendance, were gathered. Data were divided into 'pre-COVID' (September 2019-March 2020) and 'post-COVID' (March 2020-October 2020). Attendance rates were analyzed. A one-tailed t-test was used to determine if the difference in attendance rates between physician and non-physician led educational lectures was significant. A total of 711 women who are currently receiving or have completed treatment were included in Woman to Woman support network communications. Invitations were sent weekly via email for each support group. An individual's attendance was recorded for each distinct group attended. Prior to COVID, support services consisted of a general support group, a young women's support group, and a Latina educational group. A total of 9,777 invitations were sent for pre-COVID content, and total recorded attendance was 240: 185 at support groups, and 55 at the Latina educational group. Transition to virtual meetings occurred in March 2020, at which time 6 new groups were added: living with recurrent cancer support group, book club, art therapy, poetry, Sharsharet Jewish breast cancer educational collaboration, and a recurring educational group. Communications greatly increased, with a total of 32,411 invitations sent out for post-COVID content. Instructions on how to use Zoom for virtual sessions were included with calendar invites. Total recorded attendance was 738, of which 321 attended support groups, 73 attended creative groups, and 344 attended educational groups. Participation in educational sessions ranged from 14-51 attendees, with a median of 20.5 participants. Topics covered ranged from sex after gynecologic cancer and hypnosis for anxiety, to more data-driven topics such as clinical trial participation, radiation oncology, and PARP inhibitors. The latter 3 sessions were led by physicians intimately involved in patient care and yielded higher participation rates when compared with non-physician led sessions. The higher rates in attendance for physician-led sessions was statistically significant (t(234)=2.61, p=0.015). The most attended educational session covered the importance of clinical trial participation. COVID-19 challenged the gynecologic oncology community in many ways, including isolating patients from support networks. The transition of support groups to virtual forums has more than doubled attendance, reaching a broader group of women with a variety of needs, allowing for diversification of topics, and increasing physician involvement in patient support systems. Based on demonstrated increased attendance, women with gynecologic cancers are accepting of a virtual platform to deliver support services.

Design/methodology/approach: The research employs panel data regression analysis using 1,937 observations from 19 developed and 42 developing countries. The data employed contain daily registered COVID-19 cases, global equity market index prices, financial intervention policies introduced by governments and Hofstede's cultural dimension measure of PD. Findings: The authors find that investors certainly react negatively to the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported, that GFI policies indeed reinforce investors' expectations of policymakers' dedication to stabilize the economy during the COVID-19 pandemic and that equity investors in high PD cultures overreact to GFI news, resulting in more positive stock returns. The authors discover a difference between developed and developing countries in terms of the effect of GFI policies and PD on equity returns. Research limitations/implications: Results suggest that investors react negatively to the daily registered COVID-19 cases. The authors find that financial intervention policies introduced by governments reinforce investors' outlooks of policymakers' commitment to stabilize local stock markets during the coronavirus pandemic. The results confirm that equity market investors in PD cultures overreact to financial intervention news, thus resulting in more positive stock returns. Practical implications: The paper provides three original contributions. First, it helps us to understand the single effect of the COVID-19 and financial intervention policies introduced by governments on returns of the global equity market. Second, it examines the possibility of a two-way joint effect between the COVID-19 and financial intervention policies introduced by governments and the COVID-19 and differences in countries characterized by a PD culture concerning stock market returns. Third, it investigates the possibility of a three-way interaction effect between the COVID-19 contagion, financial intervention policies introduced by governments and culture on returns of equity markets. Originality/value: The authors' findings are valuable to researchers, investors and policymakers. Culture and finance scholars can now observe the role of Brown et al.'s (1988) uncertain-information hypothesis with reference to the effect of the COVID-19 and financial interventions policies introduced by governments on returns of equity markets. This is because the authors' findings underline that since investors' uncertainty declines with daily registered numbers of COVID-19 cases, the introduction of GFI policies function as a neutralizing device to re-establish investors' expectations to equilibrium. Consequently, stock market returns follow a random walk that is free from the negative effect of the COVID-19. The authors' work is likely to advise equity investors and portfolio managers about the extent to which major exogenous economic events such the outbreak of global diseases, financial interventions policies introduced by governments and differences in countries' PD culture can individually and jointly influence the return of the world's equity markets. Investors and portfolio managers can employ the authors' results as a guideline to adjust their investment strategy based on their investment decision strategy during global pandemics. Policymakers aiming to introduce financial intervention policies to stabilize their stock market returns during global pandemics can benefit from our results. They can observe the full effect of such policies during the current COVID-19, and subsequently be better prepared to choose the most effective form of financial intervention policies when the next pandemic strikes, hopefully never. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Jamaani, F.",Cross Cultural and Strategic Management,572,1

Results We recruited 70 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 146 household contacts. Transmission occurred in 60% of the households; the overall SAR for household contacts was 49.6%. The SAR was significantly higher for the Alpha variant (77.8%) compared with non-VOC variants (42.5%) and was associated with a higher viral load. SAR was higher in household contacts aged [≥]40 years (64%) than in younger contacts (40-47%), and for contacts of cases with loss of taste/smell. Close contact prior to confirmation of infection tended to give a higher SAR. A significantly lower SAR was found for sleeping separately from the primary case after confirmation of infection.

Methods: Ovid MEDLINE and Compendex were searched from inception to January 2021. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts and full text of potentially relevant reviews, using a priori inclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria were systematic reviews examining effects of HVAC design features on virus transmission. Two reviewers independently assessed methodological quality using AMSTAR2. Results: Searching identified 361 citations, 45 were potentially relevant, and 7 were included. Reviews were published between 2007 and 2021, and included 47 virus studies. Two earlier reviews (2007, 2016) of 21 studies found sufficient evidence that mechanical ventilation (airflow patterns, ventilation rates) plays a role in airborne transmission; however, both found insufficient evidence to quantify minimum mechanical ventilation requirements. One review (2017) of 9 studies examining humidity and indoor air quality found that influenza virus survival was lowest between 40% and 80% relative humidity; authors noted that ventilation rates were a confounding variable. Two reviews (2021) examined mitigation strategies for coronavirus transmission, finding droplet transmission decreased with increasing temperature and relative humidity. One review (2020) identified 14 studies examining coronavirus transmission in air-conditioning systems, finding HVAC systems played a role in virus spread during previous coronavirus outbreaks. One review (2020) examined virus transmission interventions on public ground transportation, finding ventilation and filtration to be effective. Discussion: Seven reviews synthesizing 47 studies demonstrate a role of HVAC in mitigating airborne virus transmission. Ventilation, humidity, temperature, and filtration can play a role in viability and transmission of viruses, including coronaviruses. Recommendations for minimum standards were not possible due to few studies investigating a given HVAC parameter.","Thornton, G. M.; Kroeker, E.; Fleck, B. A.; Zhong, L.; Hartling, L.",,572,20

Using a social determinants of health framework, CHJL focuses on mentoring and training students from underrepresented backgrounds to increase participation in cancer health disparities research and practice. Methods: In collaboration with the Northeast Regional Alliance HCOP Academy Program (NERA), a program that supports minority and economically disadvantaged undergraduate and high school students interested in health careers, and the Rutgers Bloustein School of Public Policy and Planning, CHJL recruits 3-4 interns per semester. Didactics include leading journal clubs focusing on social determinants of health, health disparities, adverse childhood experiences, and health equity topics. Responsibilities include developing, designing, and implementing a community-based initiative that serves vulnerable populations, grant writing, and peer-reviewed article publications in high impact journals. Results: CHJL currently has 24 members - 14 members are active, including seven interns. Two former interns have been hired as research assistants and are currently pursuing a master's degree in public health. Past members are pursuing postgraduate level education in public health and biomedical sciences. CHJL has generated seven peer-reviewed articles on areas including: systematic reviews of digital cancer education, mental health and social ties of people who are incarcerated and implementing evidence-based practices in state prisons.

Models that combine macroeconomic factors with traditional epidemic dynamics to calculate the impacts of a disease outbreak are therefore extremely useful for policymakers seeking to evaluate the best course of action in such a crisis. We developed a macroeconomic SIR model that considers herd immunity, behavior-dependent transmission rates, remote workers, and the indirect externalities of lockdowns. It is formulated as an exit time control problem where a social planner is able to prescribe separate levels of the lockdown low-risk and high-risk portions of the adult population. The model predicts that by considering the possibility of reaching herd immunity, high-risk individuals are able to leave lockdown sooner than in models where herd immunity is not considered. Additionally, a behavior-dependent transmission rate (which represents increased personal caution in response to increased infection levels) can lower both output loss and total mortality. Overall, the model-determined optimal lockdown strategy, combined with individual actions to slow virus transmission, is able to reduce total mortality to one-third of the model-predicted no-lockdown level of mortality.","Bayraktar, Erhan Cohen Asaf Nellis April",Mathematics,572,1

Furthermore, rural data are rarely centralized, precluding comparability across urban and rural regions. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to assess hospitalization rates and all-cause inpatient mortality among persons with definitive COVID-19 diagnoses residing in rural and urban areas. DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) examines a cohort of 573,018 patients from 27 US hospital systems presenting with SARS-CoV-2 infection between January 2020 and March 2021, of whom 117,897 were hospitalized. A sample of 450,725 hospitalized persons without COVID-19 diagnoses was identified for comparison. EXPOSURES: ZIP Codes provided by source hospital systems were classified by urban-rural gradient through a crosswalk to the US Department of Agriculture Rural-Urban Commuting Area Codes. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes were hospitalization and all-cause mortality among hospitalized patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis and mixed effects logistic regression were used to estimate 30-day survival in hospitalized patients and associations between rurality, hospitalization, and inpatient mortality while controlling for major risk factors. RESULTS: Rural patients were more likely to be older, white, have higher body mass index, and diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 later in the pandemic compared with their urban counterparts. Rural compared with urban inhabitants had higher rates of hospitalization (23% vs. 19%) and all-cause mortality among hospitalized patients (16% vs. 11%). After adjustment for demographic and baseline differences, rural residents (both urban adjacent and non-adjacent) with COVID-19 were more likely to be hospitalized (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) 1.41, 95% Confidence Interval (CI), 1.37-1.45 and AOR 1.42, CI 1.35-1.50) and to die or be transferred to hospice (AOR 1.62, CI 1.30-1.49 and 1.38, CI 1.30-1.49), respectively. Similar differences in mortality were noted for hospitalized patients without SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalization and inpatient mortality are higher among rural compared with urban persons with COVID-19, even after adjusting for several factors, including age and comorbidities. Further research is needed to understand the factors that drive health disparities in rural populations.","Anzalone, A.

The functions of cOMe in animals, however, remain unknown. Here we show that the two cap methyltransferases (CMTr1 and CMTr2) of Drosophila can methylate the ribose of the first nucleotide in mRNA. Double-mutant flies lack cOMe but are viable. Consistent with prominent neuronal expression, they have a reward learning defect that can be rescued by conditional expression in mushroom body neurons before training. Among CMTr targets are cell adhesion and signaling molecules relevant for learning and cOMe is required for local translation of mRNAs at synapses. Hence, our study reveals a mechanism to co-transcriptionally prime mRNAs by cOMe for localized protein synthesis at synapses.","Haussmann, Irmgard U.; Wu, Yanying; Nallasivan, Mohanakarthik P.; Archer, Nathan; Bodi, Zsuzsanna; Hebenstreit, Daniel; Waddell, Scott; Fray, Rupert; Soller, Matthias",bioRxiv,572,4

Although recent studies suggested that the incidence of M. mucogenicum infection was increased worldwide, there are no case reports of M. mucogenicum and Klebsiella pneumoniae pulmonary infection. Case Presentation: A 32-year-old non-smoking male was diagnosed with congenital atrial septal defect and pulmonary arterial hypertension. After cardiac surgery, lung infections were observed in the patient and then rapidly developed acute respiratory distress syndrome. The cefoperazone and sulbactam, vancomycin, ceftazidime, carbapenem, tigecycline, and micafungin were used for the treatment of pulmonary infection but did not affect. Ultimately, M. mucogenicum and K. pneumoniae were identified as pathogens by using next-generation sequencing. The patient was treated successfully with the administration of clarithromycin, linezolid, tigecycline, and ceftazidime-avibactam. The clinical outcome of this patient was favorable without relapse of infection. Conclusions: This case demonstrates that M. mucogenicum pulmonary infection may result in severe outcomes. The next-generation sequencing technology is important for the identification of M. mucogenicum. Additionally, the clinicians and clinical pharmacists should remain awareness in dealing with M. mucogenicum infection to avoid delaying appropriate treatment.","Wen, Z. P.; Xu, C.

This study aims to identify and prioritize on action plans related to real estate construction stakeholders.Design/methodology/approachThe study gathered challenges and action plans by distributing open questionnaire to expert to get insights in their own verbatim. Data reduction was then performed to get high-level challenges and high-level action plans. High-level action plans were then analyzed using proposed Eisenhower-simultaneous importance performance analysis (SIPA) matrix which help prioritize high-level action plans. Correlation matrix was also constructed to gain insight on relation between action plans to challenges and to three main LEAN elements (Muda, Mura and Muri). Alternative ranking method using “sum-product to 3M” approach was also performed to give complementary insights.FindingsTen action plans fall under category “Act now and become COVID-19 champion company.” One falls under category “prepare and invest now to gain competitive advantage,” one falls under category “external collaboration now to survive,” one falls under category “external collaboration for potential efficiency,” whereas the remaining six action plans fall under category “let-it-go” or “do-nothing.”Research limitations/implicationsThe study gathered only 48 and 64 respondents in its first and second questionnaires. Despite small number, the respondents are experts in their own field, and their valuable insights and responses off-set the limited number of participants. The study gives insightful action plans that can be taken by stakeholders in real-estate construction in Indonesia’s major cities analyzed by proposed Eisenhower-SIPA matrix.Originality/valueThe novelty of the research lies in the insights from industry experts in dealing with current COVID-19 pandemic in real-estate construction in Indonesia.

This affected high-value goods, as well as value-added goods. Meat production is a case in point;demand for expensive meats will drop significantly. The result could be an increase in consumption of poultry, as it is a cheap alternative to meat. Restrictive measures taken by the government in connection with the growth of Covid-19 have affected the demand of citizens for insurance services. Many producers of agricultural services have given serious thought to the need to review their insurance policies.

However, by reference to government approaches to the previous crisis in 2008, and the recession that followed, that view is here considered to be simplistic, resting in part upon an over-narrow understanding of neoliberalism. Instead, it is argued that neoliberal ideology was maintained and further embedded in responding to the financial crisis and recession, especially apparent in the prolonged austerity regime that followed. How this ideology has remained influential in guiding government responses to the pandemic is next demonstrated, and some negative consequences highlighted for both public health and social welfare. Prospects for challenging the influence of neoliberalism are then considered. In some respects, the pandemic may have enhanced resistance to such challenges by, for instance, fragmenting the cohesion of workforces, but it has also generated countervailing forces. These include the emergence of mutual aid groups and social movements which could beneficially coalesce via a human rights framework in undermining the continuing dominance of neoliberal ideology and influence. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Duncan, J.",International Journal of Human Rights,572,16

After 30 seconds contact under standard aqueous conditions CPC mouthwashes achieved a ≥4.0log10 PFU/mL reduction in SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020) titres whereas comparable products containing CHX achieved <2.0log10 PFU/mL reduction. Further testing with CPC mouthwashes demonstrated efficacy against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants, with inactivation below the limit of detection observed against the Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351) and Gamma (P.1) variants. Virucidal efficacy of CPC mouthwash was also observed in the presence of human saliva with the product delivering ≥4.0log10 PFU/mL reduction in SARS-CoV-2 titres after 30 seconds providing additional evidence for the virucidal efficacy of CPC mouthwashes under simulated physiological conditions. Together these data suggest CPC-based mouthwashes are effective at inactivating SARS-CoV-2 and further supports the use of mouthwash to mitigate the risk of transmission during dentistry procedures.","Anderson, Enyia R; Patterson, Edward I; Richards, Siobhan; Green, Alison; Mukherjee, Sayandip; Hoptroff, Michael; Hughes, Grant L",bioRxiv,572,8

In the first method, biofilms were grown on cellulose discs on an agar surface. Topical agents were spread on gauze and placed over the biofilms for 24 h. Biofilms were quantified and imaged with confocal and scanning electron microscopy. In the second method, biofilms were grown on bioabsorbable collagen coupons in a modified CDC biofilm reactor. Coupons were immersed in treatment for 24 h. The first method was limited in its ability to assess efficacy. Efficacy profiles against biofilms grown on collagen were more definitive, with CZ-01179 gel eradicating well-established biofilms to a greater degree compared to clinical standards.

Lateral flow tests for antigen and antibody detection are an obvious candidate for use in community-wide testing, because they are quick and cheap relative to lab-processed tests. However, their low accuracy has limited their adoption. We develop a new methodology to increase the diagnostic accuracy of a combination of cheap, quick and inaccurate index tests with correlated or discordant outcomes, and illustrate its performance on commercially available lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs) for Sars-CoV-2 antibody detection. Methods and Findings: We analyze laboratory test outcomes of 300 serum samples from health care workers detected with PCR-confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infection at least 21 days prior to sample collection, and 500 pre-pandemic serum samples, from a national seroprevalence survey, tested using eight LFIAs (Abbott, Biosure/Mologic, Orientgene-Menarini, Fortress, Biopanda I, Biopanda II, SureScreen and Wondfo) and Hybrid DABA as reference test. For each of 14 two-test combinations (e.g., Abbott, Fortress) and 16 three-test combinations (e.g., Abbott, Fortress, Biosure/Mologic) used on at least 100 positive and 100 negative samples, we classify an outcome sequence -- e.g., (+,-) for (Abbott, Fortress) -- as positive if its combination positive predictive value (CPPV) exceeds a given threshold, set between 0 and 1. Our main outcome measures are the sensitivity and specificity of different classification rules for classifying the outcomes of a combination test. We define testing possibility frontiers which represent sensitivity and false positive rates for different thresholds. The envelope of frontiers further enables test selection. The eight index tests individually meet neither the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency's 98% sensitivity and 98% specificity criterion, nor the US Center for Disease Control's 99.5% specificity criterion. Among these eight tests, the highest single-test LFIA specificity is 99.4% (with a sensitivity of 65.2%) and the highest single-test LFIA sensitivity is 93.4% (with a specificity of 97.4%). Using our methodology, a two-test combination meets the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency's criterion, achieving sensitivity of 98.4% and specificity of 98.0%. While two-test combinations meeting the US Center for Disease Control's 99.5% specificity criterion have sensitivity below 83.6%, a three-test combination delivers a specificity of 99.6% and a sensitivity of 95.8%. Conclusions: Current CDC guidelines suggest combining tests, noting that 'performance of orthogonal testing algorithms has not been systematically evaluated' and highlighting discordant outcomes. Our methodology combines available LFIAs to meet desired accuracy criteria, by identifying testing possibility frontiers which encompass benchmarks, enabling cost savings. Our methodology applies equally to antigen testing and can greatly expand testing capacity through combining less accurate tests, especially for use cases needing quick, accurate tests, e.g., entry to public spaces such as airports, nursing homes or hospitals.","Jain, S.; Jonasson, J.

The uniform smart city evaluation (USE) framework is constructed upon three complementary evaluation axes: the first one aims to weigh up the success of a SCC project based on performance metrics against pre-defined project-specific target values. The second axis focuses on the project’s impact towards the sustainability of a city and it is bench-marked against national and international key objectives arising from strategic plans. This bench-marking feeds the third axis which provides a more inclusive evaluation against four pre-defined and widely acclaimed sectors of interest. The steps to be followed for the uniform evaluation of each axis and corresponding index are presented in detail, including necessary key performance indicator (KPI) normalization, weighting, and aggregation methods. The resulting indices’ scores for each axis (namely project performance index, sustainability impact index, and sustainability performance index) can be post-processed with adequate data processing and visualization tools to extract important information on the extent to which the range of success of a SCC project contributes to the city sustainability progress. Illustrative examples from an on-going SCC project are provided to highlight the strengths of the approach. The proposed framework can be used to compare multiple projects within a city and sustainability and project performance in different cities, evaluate the interventions chosen per project against city needs, benchmark and design future projects (with, e.g., reverse engineering, projections), as well as evaluate various spatial and temporal scales.","Angelakoglou, Komninos Apostolopoulos Vasilis Giourka Paraskevi Nikolopoulos Nikolaos",Sustainability,572,28

This requires patients to have an understanding of their overall health. Increased frailty diminishes the potential functional recovery after both transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). Increased echocardiogram waitlist during the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need to ensure patients were appropriate and would consider intervention. A pilot nurse clinic was undertaken to assess individualised risk using geriatric assessment tools, provide education and explore patients’ GOC. Method: Patients &gt;75 years of age due for a planned valve surveillance echocardiogram were reviewed. Symptoms and important medical history were obtained. An Essential Frailty Test (EFT) was undertaken, with more detailed assessments where indicated. Principles from Serious Illness Conversation guided patient discussion, exploring patients’ understanding, goals and priorities for care. Patients discharged from echo surveillance were discussed with a cardiologist. Results: 29 patients were enrolled, with mean age, 78.59 ± 12 years. 10 continued echo surveillance, 15 elected withdrawal from surveillance as unlikely to consider intervention. This was due to overall health or GOC determined that they would rather discharge and reassess with GP if they became symptomatic, as quality of life was their focus, not mortality. 4 of these patients demonstrated new significant cognitive impairment. An additional 4 were discharged from surveillance due to prohibitive heath issues. All patients had individualised education, management plan, and referrals where required and were offered support with Advanced Care Planning. Conclusion: Empowering patient decision making with nurse led geriatric assessment, shared GOC discussion and patient education can significantly reduce echocardiography valve surveillance waitlists, while also improving patient focussed outcomes.","Eddington, R.; Johnson, K.",Heart Lung and Circulation,572,20

During COVID-19, our center implemented telemedicine (telephone and video) visits to minimize the disruption in care. Telemedicine requires access to technology and a stable internet connection. Given our center takes care of a diverse, mixed-income population, our objective was to assess if there were identifiable differences in telemedicine utilization in a diverse mixed-income population of gynecologic cancer patients treated at a single institution. We collected data on patients seen at the outpatient Gynecologic Oncology clinic at our center who underwent an inperson or telemedicine visit (telephone or video) from 3/15/2020 to 6/15/2020 as part of a quality improvement initiative. For comparison, the same data was collected in the identical period in 2019. Visit type (new/return), visit mode (in-person, telephone, and video), recorded race, and insurance type were collected from the electronic medical record. Comparisons between variables were performed using Chi-square and multivariate logistic regression. From 3/2019 to 6/2019, 679 outpatient visits occurred, all of which were in-person. In the same time period in 2020, only 388 total patient visits occurred, representing a 42.9% decrease in volume. A majority of these visits were in-person with 228 visits (58.5%), while telemedicine accounted for 161 (41.5%) of visits with 96 (24.7%) by video and 65 (16.8%) by telephone. There was no change in the overall distribution by recorded race in patients seen between 2019 and 2020 (p=0.61). The use of telemedicine (video and telephone) was not different between commercial, Medicare, and Medicaid groups (p > 0.05). African American (AA) patients had a higher proportion of Medicaid and Medicare insurance compared to non-AA groups (Medicaid: 22.5% vs. 6.1%, Medicare: 37.3% vs. 26.0%. p<0.01). When looking at details of telemedicine use, AA were more likely to use telephone visits (AA: 27.5%, non-AA: 10.6%, p<0.01) and least likely to utilize video visits (AA: 17.6%, non-AA: 28.5%, p<0.05). On multivariate analysis, race did not independently predict telemedicine use over in-person visits (AA race- aOR: 0.70 95% CI: 0.57-1.45, p > 0.05), however, did show that patients with Medicaid and Medicare insurance were more likely to have a telemedicine visit than an inperson visit (Medicare: aOR: 1.81 95% CI: 1.09-3.01, p<0.05, Medicaid: aOR: 5.28 95% CI: 2.03-13.72, p<0.01). Additionally, those who had a new patient visit were less likely to attend a telemedicine visit and more likely to be seen in-person (aOR 0.12, 95% CI: 0.05-0.30, p<0.01). [Display omitted] The use of telemedicine drastically increased in 2020 due to the pandemic. After adjusting for covariates, race and insurance status did not affect access to telemedicine. The disproportionate use of video visits by race should be investigated as the use of video may be influenced by eHealth literacy, access to technology, and may be linked in the future with reimbursement incentives. Given the continued integration of telemedicine in oncology care, further research into patient and system factors affecting telemedicine access should be explored.

Emerging evidence points to key roles for ATRX in preserving neuroprogenitor cell genomic stability, whereas ATRX function in differentiated neurons and memory processes are still unresolved. Here, we show that Atrx deletion in mouse forebrain glutamatergic neurons causes distinct hippocampal structural defects identified by magnetic resonance imaging. Ultrastructural analysis revealed fewer presynaptic vesicles and an enlarged postsynaptic area at CA1 apical dendrite-axon junctions. These synaptic defects are associated with impaired long-term contextual memory in male, but not female mice. Mechanistically, we identify ATRX-dependent and sex-specific alterations in synaptic gene expression linked to Mir137 levels, a known regulator of presynaptic processes and spatial memory. We conclude that ablation of Atrx in excitatory forebrain neurons leads to sexually dimorphic outcomes on miR-137 and on spatial memory, identifying a promising therapeutic target for neurological disorders caused by ATRX dysfunction. Summary statement Ablation of the ATRX chromatin remodeler specifically in forebrain excitatory neurons of mice causes male-specific deficits in long-term spatial memory associated with miR-137 overexpression, transcriptional changes and structural alterations corresponding to pre- and post-synaptic abnormalities.","Tamming, Renee J.; Dumeaux, Vanessa; Langlois, Luana; Ellegood, Jacob; Qiu, Lily R.; Jiang, Yan; Lerch, Jason P.; Bérubé, Nathalie G.",bioRxiv,572,11

To date the FDA has given emergency use authorization (EUA) to 48 COVID-19 in vitro diagnostic tests and 21 high complexity molecular-based laboratory developed tests, as well as implemented policies that give broad authority to clinical laboratories and commercial manufacturers in the development, distribution, and use of COVID-19 diagnostic tests. Currently, there are 2 types of diagnostic tests available for the detection of SARS-CoV-2: (1) molecular and (2) serological tests. Molecular detection of nucleic acid (RNA or DNA) sequences relating to the suspected pathogen is indicative of an active infection with the suspected pathogen. Serological tests detect antibodies against the suspected pathogen, which are produced by an individual's immune system. A positive serological test result indicates recent exposure to the suspected pathogen but cannot be used to determine if the individual is actively infected with the pathogen or immune to reinfection. In this article, the SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests currently approved by the FDA under EUA are reviewed, and other diagnostic tests that researchers are developing to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection are discussed.","Ching, Lauren; Chang, Sandra P; Nerurkar, Vivek R",Hawai'i journal of health & social welfare,572,16

DATA SOURCES Articles on clinical HIV and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) published from 1985 to 2004 were identified through four sources: Red Ribbon Centre, Special Preventive Programme, Secretariat of the Scientific Committee on AIDS, and PubMed search. The first three are operated by the Centre for Health Protection, Department of Health, Hong Kong. STUDY SELECTION Key words for the literature search were 'AIDS', 'HIV', and 'Hong Kong'. DATA EXTRACTION Only papers with original local data were included. DATA SYNTHESIS Sixty papers were identified. The contents were catalogued under seven areas: clinical epidemiology, HIV disease course and presentation, specific complications or organ-based manifestations, immunological evaluation and other monitoring, antiretroviral therapy, HIV/AIDS mortality, and HIV in specific groups. Prevalence of HIV has remained low in Hong Kong but new infections continue to occur together with a significant number of late presenters. Three published AIDS patients' series, up to the first 200 reported cases, identified Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia as the most common AIDS-defining illness in Hong Kong. Penicillium marneffei and Mycobacterium tuberculosis were two important specific infections studied most; uniqueness of the former in patients of South-East Asia was evident. Local studies of Kaposi's sarcoma and HIV-associated lymphoma have also been reported. Research on CD4 counts has revealed that it is lower in healthy and HIV-infected Chinese than their western counterparts. Children, pregnant women, and haemophiliac patients infected with HIV are among the specific groups of patients studied. Survival of patients with advanced disease has greatly improved over the years, particularly after the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy. CONCLUSION The clinical presentation and outcome of HIV/AIDS patients in Hong Kong are a mixture of those of western and developing countries. Research on clinical HIV/AIDS in Hong Kong is not only beneficial to the planning of patient care, but also enables the formulation of treatment guidelines and provides a reference for other countries.","Wong, K H; Lee, S S; Chan, K C W",Hong Kong medical journal = Xianggang yi xue za zhi,572,5

For the protection of neonatal and older animals, oral live vaccines present the attractive property of inducing desired mucosal immune responses, including colostral antibodies in sows--an effective means to passively protect suckling piglets. Newly attenuated Salmonella vaccine constructs expressing TGEV S protein epitopes were studied and evaluated for improved humoral immune response to TGEV. The macrophage-inducible Salmonella ssaH and spiC/ssaB promoters were compared for their ability to express the TGEV C and A epitopes in the context of the heterologous 987P fimbriae on Salmonella vaccines. Compared to the ssaH promoter, the Salmonella cya crp vector elicited significantly higher levels of mucosal and systemic antibodies in orally immunized mice when the chimeric fimbriae were expressed from the spiC promoter. The Salmonella spiC promoter construct induced the highest level of chimeric fimbriae after being taken up by the J774A.1 macrophagelike cells. The Salmonella cya crp vaccine vector was shown to incorporate into 987P partially degraded chimeric subunits lacking the TGEV epitopes. In contrast, its isogenic pgtE mutant produced fimbriae consisting exclusively of intact chimeric subunits. Mice immunized orally with the Salmonella pgtE vaccine expressing chimeric fimbriae from the spiC promoter elicited significantly higher systemic and mucosal antibody titers against the TGEV epitopes compared to the parental vaccine. This study indicates that the Salmonella cya crp pgtE vector and the spiC promoter can be used successfully to improve immune responses toward heterologous antigens.","Chen, Huaiqing; Schifferli, Dieter M",Infection and immunity,572,32

Identifying such events before they cause population declines requires differentiating spillover from endemic disease, a challenge complicated by a lack of baseline data from wildlife populations that are isolated from domestic animals. We tested sera collected from 12 ocelots (Leopardus pardalis) native to Barro Colorado Island, Panama, which is free of domestic animals, for antibodies to feline herpes virus, feline calicivirus, feline corona virus, feline panleukopenia virus, canine distemper virus, and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), typically a species-specific infection. Samples also were tested for feline leukemia virus antigens. Positive tests results were only observed for FIV; 50% of the ocelots were positive. We hypothesize that isolation of this population has prevented introduction of pathogens typically attributed to contact with domestic animals. The high density of ocelots on Barro Colorado Island may contribute to a high prevalence of FIV infection, as would be expected with increased contact rates among conspecifics in a geographically restricted population.","Franklin, Samuel P; Kays, Roland W; Moreno, Ricardo; TerWee, Julie A; Troyer, Jennifer L; VandeWoude, Sue",Journal of wildlife diseases,572,29

The frameshift-inducing tRNAs we show here are near-cognates for the P site codon. Their abnormal decoding induces frameshifting in either of two ways: weak codon-anticodon pairing allows the tRNA to disengage from the mRNA and slip +1, or an unusual codon-anticodon structure interferes with cognate in-frame decoding allowing out-of-frame decoding in the A site.

RESULTS Among the 115 children, there were 73 boys (63.5%) and 42 girls (36.5%), with a male/female ratio of 1:0.58. Of the 115 children, 105 (91.3%) had a definite history of close contact with individuals of SARS-CoV-2-infection. An increase in alanine aminotransferase was observed in 11 children (9.6%) and an increase in CK-MB was found in 34 children (29.6%). As for clinical symptoms, 29 children (25.2%) had fever, 47 (40.9%) had respiratory symptoms (including cough, rhinorrhea, and nasal congestion), and 61 (53.0%) were asymptomatic. Lung CT findings showed ground glass opacity, fiber opacities, patchy changes, and pulmonary consolidation in 49 children (42.6%), among whom 2 children had ""white lung""; 39 children (33.9%) only had lung texture enhancement and 27 children (23.5%) had no pulmonary imaging changes.

Drug repurposing, i.e., utilizing an approved drug for a different indication, offers a time- and cost-efficient alternative for making new (relevant) therapies available to physicians and patients. Considering given strategy, many approved and investigational antiviral compounds, alone or in various relevant combinations, used in the past to fight Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-1, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus, Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1, or Influenza viruses are being evaluated against the SARS-CoV-2. Triazavirin (TZV), a non-toxic broad--spectrum antiviral compound, is efficient against various strains of the Influenza A virus (Influenza Virus A, Orthomyxoviridae), i.e., swine flu (H1N1, or H3N2), avian influenza (H5N1, H5N2, H9N2, or highly pathogenic H7N3 strain), Influenza B virus (Influenza Virus B, Orthomyxoviridae), Respiratory Syncytial Virus (Orthopneumovirus, Pneumoviridae), Tick-Borne Encephalitis Virus (known as Forest-Spring Encephalitis Virus; Flavivirus, Flaviviridae), West Nile Virus (Flavivirus, Flavaviridae), Rift Valley Fever Virus (Phlebovirus, Bunyaviridae), and Herpes viruses (Simplexviruses, Herpesviridae) as well. In regard to COVID-19, the molecule probably reduced inflammatory reactions, thus limiting the damage to vital organs and reducing the need for therapeutic support, respectively. In addition, in silico computational methods indicated relatively satisfactory binding affinities of the TZV ligand to both structural (E)- and (S)-proteins, non-structural 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3-CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 as well as human angiotensin-I converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2). The interactions between TZV and given viral structures or the ACE-2 receptor for SARS-CoV-2 might effectively block both the entry of the pathogen into a host cell and its replication. Promising treatment patterns of COVID-19 positive patients might be also based on a suitable combination of a membrane fusion inhibitor (umifenovir, for example) with viral RNA synthesis and replication inhibitor (TZV).","Hudecová, Ivan Malík Jozef Čižmárik Gustáv Kováč Mária Pecháčová Lucia",Ceska a Slovenska farmacie : casopis Ceske farmaceuticke spolecnosti a Slovenske farmaceuticke spolecnosti,572,19

VALUES A hierarchical evaluation of the strength of evidence modified from the methods of the Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examination was used. When application of the hierarchy was not feasible or appropriate, different evaluation criteria were used. BENEFITS, HARMS AND COSTS Increased awareness of the causes of pneumonia, accurate diagnosis and prompt treatment should reduce costs associated with unnecessary investigations and complications due to inappropriate treatment. RECOMMENDATIONS Age is the best predictor of the cause of pediatric pneumonia, viral pneumonia being most common during the first 2 years of life. The absence of a symptom cluster of respiratory distress, tachypnea, crackles and decreased breath sounds accurately excludes the presence of pneumonia (level II evidence). Bacterial cultures of samples from the nasopharynx and throat have no predictive value; however, Gram staining and culture of sputum from older children and adolescents are useful (level III evidence). Oral antimicrobial therapy will provide adequate coverage for most mild to moderate forms of pneumonia in children (level III evidence). Parenteral therapy is typically reserved for neonates and patients with severe pneumonia admitted to hospital (level III evidence). VALIDATION These recommendations are based on consensus of Canadian experts in infectious diseases and microbiology. They are the only guidelines to address antimicrobial treatment from an age-related, etiologic perspective.

The difference in organ tropism between these two closely related MHVs is not related to the ability of these viruses to grow in brain cells since both viruses grow equally well in primary glial cell cultures derived from neonatal mouse brains. We postulated therefore that the ability of the virus to stimulate certain host immunological factors may be important for protection of the brain against invasion and replication of the virus. In this study we performed preliminary experiments to investigate the potential role of two host factors in protection of the brain against MHV invasion: cytotoxic T cells and interferon. Four week old beta 2M(-/-) mice, lacking beta 2 microglobulin, MHC class I expression and functional cytotoxic CD8+ T cells were inoculated intracerebrally (IC) with MHV-2 and analyzed at various intervals post infection for histopathology and viral titers in organs. Histology revealed both acute hepatitis and acute encephalitis. Acute encephalitis was observed in periventricular areas. Mononuclear lymphocytic infiltration involved the choroid plexus, the ependyma and in the surrounding brain parenchyma. There was no involvement of other areas of the brain including areas that are typically involved in A59 infection of C57B1/6 mice. By contrast, C57b1/6 mice infected with MHV-2 showed no involvement of the brain parenchyma and only slight inflammation of the choroid plexus was present. High titers of infectious virus was detected by plaque assay in both brains and livers of beta 2M(-/-) mice infected with MHV-2 in contrast to only liver titers in C57B1/6 mice infected with a similar dose of MHV-2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)","Lavi, E; Wang, Q",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,572,16

Purified bovine coronavirus (BCV) preparations have an esterase activity which inactivates O-acetylsialic acid-containing receptors on erythrocytes. Diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) completely inhibits this receptor-destroying activity of BCV, suggesting that the viral enzyme is a serine esterase. Treatment of purified BCV with [3H]DFP and subsequent sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the proteins revealed that the E3 protein was specifically phosphorylated. This finding suggests that the esterase/receptor-destroying activity of BCV is associated with the E3 protein. Furthermore, treatment of BCV with DFP dramatically reduced its infectivity in a plaque assay. It is assumed that the esterase activity of BCV is required in an early step of virus replication, possibly during virus entry or uncoating.","Vlasak, R; Luytjes, W; Leider, J; Spaan, W; Palese, P",Journal of virology,572,16

Negative-contrast electron microscopy showed an abundance of coronavirus particles in the intestinal contents and intestinal epithelium of moribund mice. We found no other virus in the epizootic. Dams seroconverted to MHV polyvalent antigen and to the agent isolated, but did not develop antibodies to other known mouse pathogens. Virus propagated in NCTC-1469 tissue culture produced enteric disease in suckling mice but not fatal diarrhea; the dams of these mice also developed antibodies to MHV and to the isolates. By complement fixation, single radial hemolysis, and quantal neutralization tests, we found the isolates antigenically most closely related to MHV-S, unilaterally related to MHV-JHM, and more distantly related to MHV-1, MHV-3, MHV-A59, and human coronavirus OC-43. We also studied cross-reactions among the murine and human coronaviruses in detail. Tissues of infected newborn mice were examined by light microscopy, thin-section electron microscopy, and frozen-section indirect immunofluorescence, revealing that viral antigen, virus particles, and pathological changes were limited to the intestinal tract.

With advances in immunosuppression, the short-term and long-term outcome has improved significantly. Subsequently, urologists are encountering more transplant recipients with genitourinary malignancies, and therefore urologists are becoming increasingly compelled to offer curative treatment options. MATERIALS AND METHODS We present modifications to facilitate E-RARP in these patients that include modified trocar arrangement, delayed bladder neck transection, utilizing the robotic Hem-o-lok applier, and posterior reconstruction of the anastomosis using a barbed V-loc suture. A 68-year-old male with a history of polycystic kidney disease, end-stage renal failure, and an allograft renal transplantation in the right iliac fossa, presented with T1c, Gleason 3+4 prostate cancer. He had a preoperative PSA of 6.93ng/mL, ASA score of 3, and a BMI of 26kg/m2. Follow-up for metastasis (MRI and bone scan) was negative. E-RARP was performed via the extraperitoneal approach using a 5-port 2-arm approach at an insufflation pressure of 10 mm Hg. RESULTS The radical prostatectomy was successfully performed. Ureterovesical anastomosis was completed, and total console time was 130 minutes, with an estimated blood loss of 125mL. Final pathology was T2bNx, Gleason 3+4 with negative surgical margins. The patient was discharged with no change in serum creatinine or GFR. The catheter was removed on POD 10 with no intraoperative or immediate postoperative complications. CONCLUSION E-RARP in the carefully selected renal allograft recipient is feasible and accomplished safely with technical modifications to avoid injuring the renal allograft, transplanted ureter, and ureteroneocystostomy.","Ghazi, Ahmed; Erturk, Erdal; Joseph, Jean V",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,572,23

Sodium azulene sulfonate is clinically used as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of pharyngitis as well as other inflammatory diseases such as tonsillitis, stomatitis and conjunctivitis. There has been no documentation on the effect of sodium azulene sulfonate on pharyngitis in laboratory models, probably because of no availability of such models. We recently established a pharyngitis model using capsaicin application on pharyngeal mucosa in rats. The present study investigated the antipharyngitis activity of sodium azulene sulfonate comparing with those of ruthenium red (vanilloid receptor antagonist, 8.5 and 85 mg/ml), ascorbic acid (antioxidative compound, 100 microg/ml), povidone iodine (gargle as disinfectant, oxidative compound, 5 and 20 mg/ml) and diclofenac sodium (cyclooxygenase inhibitor, 0.1 and 1 mg/ml). As an antipharyngeal effect, the capsaicin-induced plasma exudation in the pharyngeal mucosa of the rat was evaluated. The capsaicin-induced plasma exudation in the pharyngeal mucosa was inhibited by sodium azulene sulfonate (100 and 200 microg/ml) as well as ruthenium red and ascorbic acid, but not by povidone iodine and dicrofenac sodium; povidone iodine rather promoted the plasma exudation. In conclusion, the antipharyngitis effect of sodium azulene sulfonate was demonstrated for the first time in a laboratory model. Although the mechanism by which sodium azulene sulfonate inhibited the capsaicin-induced pharyngitis is not yet unraveled, antioxidative effect, but not inhibitory effect on cyclooxygenase pathway, might be involved.","Sakai, Hiroyasu; Misawa, Miwa",Basic & clinical pharmacology & toxicology,572,24

Digital mental health offers potential to increase access to care, but tangible risks around safety and poor efficacy remain common. METHODS We conduct a select analysis of U.S. and international published evidence, government websites, grey literature, and media outlets. We present the marked discordance around digital mental health policy, as these frameworks grapple with the challenges of regulating in this sphere. RESULTS Across the world, there is no consensus around evaluation with countries piloting or proposing different models. Common barriers include the defining the scope and risk of health apps, creating processes able to update evaluation with software updates, lacking better data to inform evaluation, and educating users to the risks and benefits. DISCUSSION We propose four next steps for guiding any future policy: (i) clear clarification of the categorical status of mental health apps; (ii) objective methodology for assessing apps on a premarket basis which does not solely rely on self-reporting; (iii) well-designed, detailed procedures for iterative post-market app review; (iv) clinician and patient education which empowers users to make smart mental health app choices.","Kahane, Kelila; François, Josie; Torous, John",The journal of mental health policy and economics,572,16

In a linear supply chain, manufactured products are used once and discarded. In high-income nations, health care systems increasingly rely on linear supply chains composed of single-use disposable medical devices. This has resulted in increased health care expenditures and health care-generated waste and pollution, with associated public health damage. It has also caused the supply chain to be vulnerable to disruption and demand fluctuations. Transformation of the medical device industry to a more circular economy would advance the goal of providing increasingly complex care in a low-emissions future. Barriers to circularity include perceptions regarding infection prevention, behaviors of device consumers and manufacturers, and regulatory structures that encourage the proliferation of disposable medical devices. Complementary policy- and market-driven solutions are needed to encourage systemic transformation.","MacNeill, Andrea J; Hopf, Harriet; Khanuja, Aman; Alizamir, Saed; Bilec, Melissa; Eckelman, Matthew J; Hernandez, Lyndon; McGain, Forbes; Simonsen, Kari; Thiel, Cassandra; Young, Steven; Lagasse, Robert; Sherman, Jodi D",Health affairs,572,16

Initially, the patient was fixed in a semiprone position, from which he could be rotated to a prone or left lateral position. Four ports were inserted, and then the patient was rotated to the prone position. Once the patient was prone, gravity caused the lung to move downwards. Next, the chest cavity was inflated with a CO(2) insufflation pressure of 6 mm Hg. Esophagectomy was then performed, and the lymph nodes in the middle and lower mediastinum and along the right recurrent laryngeal nerve were dissected. In the left upper mediastinum, lymph node dissection was performed after the residual esophagus was stripped. Stripping of the residual esophagus created sufficient working space and a clear operative field for lymph node dissection. VATS-E in the prone position has achieved remarkable results in Japan. It allows a clear operative view of the middle and lower mediastinum, but the working space in the upper mediastinum is limited. Our results indicate that esophageal stripping in prone VATS-E allows for safe and straightforward lymph node dissection along the left recurrent laryngeal nerve. Our technique overcame the difficulties usually encountered with this type of lymph node dissection.","Makino, Hiroshi; Nomura, Tsutomu; Miyashita, Masao; Okawa, Keiichi; Hagiwara, Nobutoshi; Uchida, Eiji",Journal of Nippon Medical School = Nippon Ika Daigaku zasshi,572,1

However, the effectiveness of these compounds depends on how much soil (bioburden) is present on the hands. Workers in health care environments and other public places must wash their hands before using antiseptics and/or wearing gloves. However, alcohol-based antiseptics, also called rubs and sanitizers, can be very effective for rapidly destroying some pathogens by the action of the aqueous alcohol solution without the need for water or drying with towels. Alcohol-based compounds seem to be the most effective treatment against gram-negative bacteria on lightly soiled hands, but antimicrobial soaps are as good or better when hands are more heavily contaminated. Instant sanitizers have no residual effect, unlike some antimicrobial soaps that retain antimicrobial activity after the hygienic action has been completed, e.g., after hand washing. Many alcohol-based hand rubs have antimicrobial agents added to them, but each formulation must be evaluated against the target pathogens in the environment of concern before being considered for use. Wipes also are widely used for quick cleanups of hands, other body parts, and surfaces. These wipes often contain alcohol and/or antimicrobial compounds and are used for personal hygiene where water is limited. However, antiseptics and wipes are not panaceas for every situation and are less effective in the presence of more than a light soil load and against most enteric viruses.","Todd, Ewen C D; Michaels, Barry S; Holah, John; Smith, Debra; Greig, Judy D; Bartleson, Charles A",Journal of food protection,572,27

We recruited eight asthmatics and nine healthy subjects on Day 4 of a cold. Viral infection was confirmed in six of the asthmatics (influenza A or B) and six of the healthy subjects (influenza A, rhinovirus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and coronavirus). In the subjects with confirmed virus infection, five of the asthmatics had an objective exacerbation of asthma during the cold. Their sputum on Day 4 showed a high median total cell count of 19.7 x 10(6) cells/ml with a modest neutrophilia (58. 5%) and high levels of interleukin-8 (IL-8) (16,000 pg/ml), eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP) (1,880 microgram/L) and very high levels of fibrinogen (250 mg/L). In contrast, the proportion (1.3%) and absolute number of eosinophils was low. IL-2 levels were within the normal range, whereas IL-5 and interferon gamma were under the limit of detection of the assays. In the healthy subjects with a confirmed virus infection the sputum findings were qualitatively similar but significantly less prominent. Sputum IL-8 on Day 4 was strongly correlated with neutrophils (rs = 0.8, p < 0.001). This correlation was also significant when each group was analyzed separately. On Day 21 there was a fall in the absolute number of neutrophils and in ECP and fibrinogen levels in both groups. Similar results were found in the two asthmatic and three healthy subjects with a cold of comparable severity but in whom viral infection was not confirmed. We conclude that induced sputum examination can be used to study the effects of natural colds and influenza on the airways of the lungs. The results also suggest that natural colds, on Day 4, cause neutrophilic lower airway inflammation that is greater in asthmatics than in healthy subjects. The greater inflammatory response in asthmatics may be due to the changes associated with trivial eosinophilia or to the different viruses involved.","Pizzichini, M M; Pizzichini, E; Efthimiadis, A; Chauhan, A J; Johnston, S L; Hussack, P; Mahony, J; Dolovich, J; Hargreave, F E",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,572,10

Methods: A novel questionnaire was developed to collect provider impressions about video teleneurology encounters. All providers in the University of Pennsylvania Health System (UPHS) Neurology Department (N = 162) were asked to complete a questionnaire after each video teleneurology patient encounter between April and August 2020. Individual patient and encounter-level data were extracted from the electronic medical record. Results: One thousand six hundred three surveys were completed by 55 providers (response rate of 10.12%). The history obtained and the ability to connect with the patient were considered the same or better than an in-person visit in almost all encounters. The quality of the physician-patient relationship was good or excellent in 93%, while the overall experience was the same as an in-person visit in 73% of visits and better in 12%.

This study investigated the impact of these control measures on the incidence rates of hospital-acquired infections (HAI) and multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) in a Taiwan medical center. METHODS: This study compared the consumption of personal prevention resources and the incidence density of HAI and MDRO in a medical center in Taiwan from January to May 2020, encapsulating the COVID-19 outbreak period in the study, to baseline data from the same timeframe in 2018 and 2019. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the number of inpatient days in 2020, 2018 and 2019. The consumption of either alcohol for hand hygiene or surgical masks significantly increased in 2020. However, the overall HAI incidence density did not significantly differ from the rate at the baseline period. It was found that the incidence density of MDRO was significantly lower in 2020, especially in carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus. CONCLUSIONS: A collateral benefit of the COVID-19 prevention measures on the incidence density of MDRO was observed in a hospital in Taiwan where the incidence of COVID-19 was low.","Lo, Shih-Hao; Lin, Chun-Yu; Hung, Ching-Tzu; He, Jyun-Ji; Lu, Po-Liang",Int J Infect Dis,572,24

Methods: Confirmed COVID-19 patients from hospitals in 10 cities of Jiangsu province, China were retrospectively included between January 18, 2020, and February 26, 2020. Hepatic Steatosis Index (HSI) was used to defined NAFLD. Results: A total of 280 COVID-19 patients were enrolled. Eighty-six (30.7%) of 280 COVID-19 patients were diagnosed as NAFLD by HSI. 100 (35.7%) patients presented abnormal liver function on admission. The median ALT levels (34.5 U/L vs. 23.0 U/L, P<0.001) and the proportion of elevated ALT (>40 U/L) (40.7% vs. 10.8%, P<0.001) were significantly higher in patients with NAFLD than in patients without NAFLD on admission. The proportion of elevated ALT in patients with NAFLD was also significantly higher than patients without NAFLD (65.1% vs. 38.7%, P<0.001) during hospitalization. Multivariate analysis showed that age over 50 years (odds ratio [OR] 2.077, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.183-3.648, P=0.011), and concurrent NAFLD (OR 2.956, 95% CI 1.526-5.726, P=0.001) were independent risk factors of ALT elevation in COVID-19 patients, while the atomized inhalation of interferon &#945;-2b (OR 0.402, 95%CI 0.236-0.683, P=0.001) was associated with the reduced risk of ALT elevation during hospitalization. No patient developed liver failure or death during hospitalization. The complications and clinical outcomes were comparable between COVID-19 patients with and without NAFLD.

He tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on postmortem nasopharyngeal and lung parenchymal swabs. Autopsy revealed diffuse alveolar damage and chronic inflammation and edema in the bronchial mucosa. A 42-year-old obese man with a history of myotonic dystrophy developed abdominal pain followed by fever, shortness of breath, and cough. Postmortem nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2; lung parenchymal swabs were negative. Autopsy showed acute bronchopneumonia with evidence of aspiration. Neither autopsy revealed viral inclusions, mucus plugging in airways, eosinophils, or myocarditis. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 testing can be performed at autopsy. Autopsy findings such as diffuse alveolar damage and airway inflammation reflect true virus-related pathology; other findings represent superimposed or unrelated processes.","Barton, Lisa M; Duval, Eric J; Stroberg, Edana; Ghosh, Subha; Mukhopadhyay, Sanjay",Am J Clin Pathol,572,16

The results reveal that, while managing COVID-19 inflow risk pressure plays a critical role in the city's pandemic disaster resilience. city agglomeration characteristics also matters. To be exact, we find that large and high-density cities with high inter and intra-city mobility flows have more difficulties in containing the epidemic spread, but improving healthcare infrastructure adequacy and urban governance capacity can increase time efficacy of pandemic control and then improve the city's resilience against pandemic. Although our analysis is based on the performance of Chinese cities in the case of COVID-19, the research framework can be applied in understanding COVID-19 control performance of cities in other countries and the findings can be useful for improving health-related urban resilience and sustainability.","Yang, Tianren; Pan, Haozhi; Zhang, Xiaoling; Greenlee, Andrew; Deal, Brian",Sustain Cities Soc,572,24

We investigated the combined effects of long-term exposure to fine particle matter (PM2.5) and habitual exercise on deaths from natural causes in Taiwan. METHODS: We recruited 384 130 adults (aged &#8805; 18 yr) with 842 394 medical examination records between 2001 and 2016, and followed all participants until May 31, 2019. We obtained vital data from the National Death Registry of Taiwan. We estimated PM2.5 exposure using a satellite-based spatiotemporal model, and collected information on exercise habits using a standard self-administered questionnaire. We analyzed the data using a Cox regression model with time-dependent covariates. RESULTS: A higher level of habitual exercise was associated with a lower risk of death from natural causes, compared with inactivity (hazard ratio [HR] 0.84, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.80-0.88 for the moderate exercise group; HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.62-0.68 for the high exercise groups), whereas a higher PM2.5 exposure was associated with a higher risk of death from natural causes compared with lower exposure (HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.98-1.07, and HR 1.15, 95% CI 1.10-1.20, for the moderate and high PM2.5 exposure groups, respectively). Compared with inactive adults with high PM2.5 exposure, adults with high levels of habitual exercise and low PM2.5 exposure had a substantially lower risk of death from natural causes. We found a minor, but statistically significant, interaction effect between exercise and PM2.5 exposure on risk of death (HR 1.03 95% CI 1.01-1.06). Subgroup analyses, stratified by PM2.5 categories, suggested that moderate and high levels of exercise were associated with a lower risk of death in each PM2.5 stratum, compared with inactivity. INTERPRETATION: Increased levels of exercise and reduced PM2.5 exposure are associated with a lower risk of death from natural causes. Habitual exercise can reduce risk regardless of the levels of PM2.5 exposure. Our results suggest that exercise is a safe health improvement strategy, even for people residing in relatively polluted regions.","Guo, Cui; Yu, Tsung; Chang, Ly-Yun; Lin, Changqing; Yang, Hsiao Ting; Bo, Yacong; Zeng, Yiqian; Tam, Tony; Lau, Alexis K H; Lao, Xiang Qian",CMAJ,572,16

Austempered ductile irons (ADI) are ductile iron castings with strength and mechanical properties enhanced after specific heat treatment, achieving 1000 MPa or even more. Sintered carbide tools are state of the art in many industrial applications, including iron casting machining, but ceramic inserts are a feasible and promising option since cutting speed can be improved by 5 or even 10 times. A complete testing campaign was performed, starting with coated sintered carbides and aiming at the use of whisker reinforced Al2O3 ceramics and Si3N4 tools. The two most important conclusions are as follows: firstly, that the milling type so-called up-milling (or conventional) is more recommended than down-milling, also known as climb milling, and secondly, that dry machining enhances ceramics performance in comparison with using emulsion coolants (oil in water). Finally, results regarding economic aspects were analyzed based on the tools cost-performance ratio.","López de Lacalle, L N; Fernández Valdivielso, A; Amigo, F J; Sastoque, L",Int J Adv Manuf Technol,572,16

We aimed to evaluate for subclinical LV dysfunction in patients with COVID-19 through myocardial strain analysis. Methods: We performed a single-center retrospective cohort study of all patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who underwent echocardiography. Traditional echocardiographic and global longitudinal strain (GLS) values were compared with prior and subsequent echocardiograms. Results: Among 96 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 with complete echocardiograms, 67 (70%) had adequate image quality for strain analysis. The cohort was predominantly male (63%) and 18% had prevalent cardiovascular disease (CVD). Echocardiograms were largely normal with median [IQR] LV ejection fraction (EF) 62% [56%, 68%]. However, median GLS was abnormal in 91% (-13.5% [-15.0%, -10.8%]). When stratified by CVD, both groups had abnormal GLS, but presence of CVD was associated with worse median GLS (-11.6% [-13.4%, -7.2%] vs -13.9% [-15.0%, -11.3%], p=0.03). There was no difference in EF or GLS when stratified by symptoms or need for intensive care. Compared to pre-COVID-19 echocardiograms, EF was unchanged, but median GLS was significantly worse (-15% [-16%, -14%] vs -12% [-14%, -10%], p=0.003). Serial echocardiograms showed no significant changes in GLS or EF overall, however patients who died had stable or worsening GLS, while those who survived to discharge home showed improved GLS. Conclusions: Patients with COVID-19 had evidence of subclinical cardiac dysfunction manifested by reduced GLS despite preserved EF. These findings were observed regardless of history of CVD, presence of COVID-19 symptoms, or severity of illness.

Differently from wild, in captivity, feeding is not interrupted during the reproductive period, the females do not spawn spontaneously, and they are sedentary. Adult females were sampled monthly and based on their histology and gonadosomatic index (GSI), ovaries were classified into: previtellogenic (PRV), vitellogenic (VTG), and regression (REG) stages. Ovaries at the VTG stage showed higher protein and lipids levels than at the PRV stage with a positive correlation between these substrates and the GSI. Muscle was the main source of proteins transferred to the ovaries, according to the negative correlation between these organs. Lipids remained unchanged in the liver, which is an important supplier in vitellogenesis, a pattern that probably occurs due to the continuous feeding. Muscular glycogen levels were higher at the VTG and REG than at the PRV stages. Plasma triglycerides were also higher during REG, while glucose levels were more elevated during the VTG stage. These results suggest that with constant food supply, the pattern of deposition of ES in S. parahybae is different from that described for other wild potamodromous species.(AU)","Tolussi, Carlos E; Gomes, Aline D; Ribeiro, Cristiéle da S; Caneppele, Danilo; Moreira, Renata G; Honji, Renato M",Neotrop. ichthyol,572,24

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is known to cause vascular endothelial dysfunction. However, the long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 in resistance vessels remains unknown. This study is designed to test whether endothelium-dependent vasodilation in human arterioles remains impaired after clearance of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Fresh human adipose tissues were obtained as discarded surgical specimens from control subjects (n=15, no SARS-CoV-2 exposure, 46.7±4 years) and previously SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects (PSPSs: n=8, 35.8±3.8 years). Among PSPSs, the time between positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 test results was ≤3 months (n=6) or 8 months (n=2). Isolated arterioles (100-200 µm) were cannulated under 60 mmHg and examined for diameter changes to acetylcholine (ACh;10?9 to 10?5 M) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP: 10?9 to 10?4 M) using videomicroscopy. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) was recorded at steady-state during graded increases in intraluminal pressure gradients (5-100 cm H2O). Dilation to ACh and FMD in arterioles from PSPSs was significantly reduced (ACh max. dilation at 10?5 M: 60±6% vs. 92.8±3.9% in control, n=7-8, P&lt;0.001;FMD max. dilation at 100 cm H2O: 39.9±5.7% vs. 85.8±1.8% in control, n=6-8, P&lt;0.001, Fig.1) while endothelial-independent dilation in response to SNP was not different between groups (max. dilation at 10-4 M: 86.6±2.7% vs. 92.3±2.1% in control, n=5). To compare time-dependent effects of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, we compared max. dilator capacity vs. time after exposure (Fig. 2). At ≤3 months post exposure, FMD was significantly impaired (% max. dilation: 26.7±7.4, n=5) whereas at 8 months endothelial function began to normalize (% max. dilation: 41.8±17.6, n=2).

We report here a synthetic biology-based vaccine platform that employs an expression vector with an inducible gram-negative autotransporter to express vaccine antigens on the surface of genome-reduced bacteria to enhance interaction of vaccine antigen with the immune system. As a proof-of-principle, we utilized genome-reduced Escherichia coli to express SARS-CoV-2 and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) fusion peptide (FP) on the cell surface, and evaluated their use as killed whole-cell vaccines. The FP sequence is highly conserved across coronaviruses; the six FP core amino acid residues, along with the four adjacent residues upstream and the three residues downstream from the core, are identical between SARS-CoV-2 and PEDV. We tested the efficacy of PEDV FP and SARS-CoV-2 FP vaccines in a PEDV challenge pig model. We demonstrated that both vaccines induced potent anamnestic responses upon virus challenge, potentiated interferon-Î³ responses, reduced viral RNA loads in jejunum tissue, and provided significant protection against clinical disease. However, neither vaccines elicited sterilizing immunity. Since SARS-CoV-2 FP and PEDV FP vaccines provided similar clinical protection, the coronavirus FP could be a target for a broadly protective vaccine using any platform. Importantly, the genome-reduced bacterial surface-expressed vaccine platform, when using a vaccine-appropriate bacterial vector, has potential utility as an inexpensive, readily manufactured, and rapid vaccine platform for other pathogens.","Maeda, Denicar Lina Nascimento Fabris; Tian, Debin; Yu, Hanna; Dar, Nakul; Rajasekaran, Vignesh; Meng, Sarah; Mahsoub, Hassan M; Sooryanarain, Harini; Wang, Bo; Heffron, C Lynn; Hassebroek, Anna; LeRoith, Tanya; Meng, Xiang-Jin; Zeichner, Steven L",Proc.

Presented intermediate results evaluate the first infection period until the end of September 2020. METHODS: The study ""COVID-19: Hotspot hospital?- Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in hospital employees in a secondary care hospital network in Germany "" is a prospective, single centre observational cohort study conducted at the St. Vincenz Hospital Datteln with 316 beds. The presented data include one other hospital: St. Laurentius Stift Waltrop, Germany with 172 beds. RESULTS: Between June 2020 and September 2020 we analyzed serum samples of 907 employees which represents 62.1% of all employees. Thirteen employees (1.4%), respectively 13/696 healthcare workers (HCWs) (1.9%) had detectable SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Among them, 4 (30.8%) were aware of COVID-19 exposure, and 5 (38.5%) reported clinical symptoms. HCWs working in high-risk areas had a seroprevalence rate of 1.6% (1/64), HCWs working in intermediate-risk area 1.7% (11/632) and 0.5% employees (1/211) in low-risk areas with no contact to patients were seropositive. CONCLUSION: Even if we treated COVID-19 positive patients, we found no clear evidence that infection was transmitted to HCWs in contact to these patients. As knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 transmission evolves, the concept of infection prevention must be continuously reviewed and adapted as needed to keep hospitals a safe place.","Hildebrandt, Anke; Hökelekli, Oktay; Uflacker, Lutz; Rudolf, Henrik; Gatermann, Sören G",Int J Hyg Environ Health,572,10

Most recently, in the effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, these data can be used and explored to track mobility patterns and monitor the results of lockdown measures. However, as rightly noted by other scholars, most of the work has been limited to proofs of concept or academic work: it is hard to point to any real-world use cases. In contrast, this paper uses mobile data to obtain insight on urban mobility patterns, such as number of trips, average trip length, and relation between poverty, mobility, and areas of Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone. These data were used in preparation of an urban mobility lending operation. Additionally, the paper describes good practices in the following areas: accessing mobile data from telecom operators, frameworks for generating origin and destination matrices, and validation of results.","Matekenya, Dunstan Espinet Alegre Xavier Arroyo Arroyo Fatima Gonzalez Marta World Bank Group",,572,1

STUDY DESIGN: Experimental study. METHODS: Fresh 172 RRP tissue samples from 12 patients were implanted onto chick embryo CAMs. Morphological and morphometric analysis of the experimental CAM and chorionic epithelium was performed. The microvascular network of the CAM with the RRP implant was investigated under the effect of fluoresceinated anionic dextran. The peculiarities of the clinical course of the disease were evaluated. RESULTS: The implanted RRP tissue samples survived on CAMs in 86% of cases, retaining their essential morphologic characteristics and proliferative capacity of the original tumor. Implants induced thickening of both the CAM and the chorionic epithelium, but none of the RRP implants crossed the basement membrane of the hosting CAM. A ""crawling film"" of acellular material with newly formed papilloma sprouts located on the outer chorionic epithelium of the CAM was detected. Direct association between a recurrence rate of RRP and the number of newly formed papilloma sprouts around the implanted tumor on CAMs was revealed. CONCLUSION: The chicken embryo CAM-based model is appropriate for investigations of RRP and facilitates the understanding of tumor biology and the clinical course of the disease, thus providing the basis for further research and acceleration of the identification and development of new specific therapeutic compounds that limit the spread and recurrence of RRP.

However, the incidence and clinical relevance of this relation remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the incidence, severity and clinical impact of acute pancreatitis in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study of a prospective, observational cohort concerning all COVID-19 patients admitted to two Dutch university hospitals between 4 March 2020 and 26 May 2020. Primary outcome was acute pancreatitis potentially related to COVD-19 infection. Acute pancreatitis was defined according to the revised Atlanta Classification. Potential relation with COVID-19 was defined as the absence of a clear aetiology of acute pancreatitis. RESULTS: Among 433 patients with COVID-19, five (1.2%) had potentially related acute pancreatitis according to the revised Atlanta Classification. These five patients suffered from severe COVID-19 infection; all had (multiple) organ failure and 60% died. None of the patients developed necrotizing pancreatitis. Moreover, development of acute pancreatitis did not lead to major treatment consequences. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast with previous research, our study demonstrated that COVID-19 related acute pancreatitis is rare and of little clinical impact. It is therefore debatable if acute pancreatitis in COVID-19 patients requires specific screening. We hypothesize that acute pancreatitis occurs in patients with severe illness due to COVID-19 infection as a result of transient hypoperfusion and pancreatic ischemia, not as a direct result of the virus.","Bulthuis, Margo C; Boxhoorn, Lotte; Beudel, Martijn; Elbers, Paul W G; Kop, Marnix P M; van Wanrooij, Roy L J; Besselink, Marc G; Voermans, Rogier P",Scand J Gastroenterol,572,18

Yet, access to the levels of water supply that support good hand hygiene and institutional cleaning, our understanding of hygiene behaviours, and access to soap are deficient in low-, middle- and high-income countries. This paper reviews the role of water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH) in disease emergence, previous outbreaks, combatting COVID-19 and in preparing for future pandemics. We consider settings where these factors are particularly important and identify key preventive contributions to disease control and gaps in the evidence base. Urgent substantial action is required to remedy deficiencies in WaSH, particularly the provision of reliable, continuous piped water on-premises for all households and settings. Hygiene promotion programmes, underpinned by behavioural science, must be adapted to high-risk populations (such as the elderly and marginalised) and settings (such as healthcare facilities, transport hubs and workplaces). WaSH must be better integrated into preparation plans and with other sectors in prevention efforts. More finance and better use of financing instruments would extend and improve WaSH services.

Computer-assisted telephone interviews were conducted consisting of 29 questions on the topic of lifestyle habits during the lockdown. The cohort comprised 51.5% women and 51% overweight or obese subjects and had a mean age of 50 ± 18 years. Of the respondents, 44.5% self-reported weight gain during the lockdown; of these, 58.0% were women, 69.9% had previous excess weight, 44.7% lived with a relative who also gained weight, and 73.5 experienced increased appetite. Further, an increased consumption of energy-dense products was found relative to respondents who did not gain weight (p &#8804; 0.016 for all). Additionally, respondents were unaware that obesity is a poor prognostic factor for COVID-19 infection, lived in smaller flats, and had a lower level of education and lower monthly income. The factors independently associated with weight gain were female gender, previous overweight or obesity, lack of food care, increased appetite, and increased consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, alcoholic beverages, and snacks (p &#8804; 0.023 for all).

We searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, medRxiv, bioRxiv, ClinicalTrials.gov, COVID-19 Open Research Dataset, COVID-19 research database, Epistemonikos, EPPI-Centre, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Scopus and Web of Science databases for studies where a non-contact infrared device was used to detect fever against a reference standard of conventional thermometers. Forest plots and Hierarchical Summary Receiver Operating Characteristics curves were used to describe the pooled summary estimates of sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic odds ratio. From a total of 1063 results, 30 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis, of which 19 were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.808 (95%CI 0.656-0.903) and 0.920 (95%CI 0.769-0.975), respectively, for the NCITs (using forehead as the site of measurement), and 0.818 (95%CI 0.758-0.866) and 0.923 (95%CI 0.823-0.969), respectively, for thermal scanners. The sensitivity of NCITs increased on use of rectal temperature as the reference. The sensitivity of thermal scanners decreased in a disease outbreak/pandemic setting. Changes approaching statistical significance were also observed on the exclusion of neonates from the analysis. Thermal screening had a low positive predictive value, especially at the initial stage of an outbreak, whereas the negative predictive value (NPV) continued to be high even at later stages. Thermal screening has reasonable diagnostic accuracy in the detection of fever, although it may vary with changes in subject characteristics, setting, index test and the reference standard used. Thermal screening has a good NPV even during a pandemic.

MethodsWe recruited COVID-19 cases to give blood, saliva, mid-turbinate and fomite (phone) swabs, and 30-minute breath samples while vocalizing into a Gesundheit-II, with and without masks at up to two visits two days apart. We quantified and sequenced viral RNA, cultured virus, and assayed sera for anti-spike and anti-receptor binding domain antibodies. ResultsWe enrolled 49 seronegative cases (mean days post onset 3.8 {+/-}2.1), May 2020 through April 2021. We detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 45% of fine ([≤]5 {micro}m), 31% of coarse (>5 {micro}m) aerosols, and 65% of fomite samples overall and in all samples from four alpha-variant cases. Masks reduced viral RNA by 48% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3 to 72%) in fine and by 77% (95% CI, 51 to 89%) in coarse aerosols; cloth and surgical masks were not significantly different. The alpha variant was associated with a 43-fold (95% CI, 6.6 to 280-fold) increase in fine aerosol viral RNA, compared with earlier viruses, that remained a significant 18-fold (95% CI, 3.4 to 92-fold) increase adjusting for viral RNA in saliva, swabs, and other potential confounders. Two fine aerosol samples, collected while participants wore masks, were culture-positive. ConclusionSARS-CoV-2 is evolving toward more efficient aerosol generation and loose-fitting masks provide significant but only modest source control. Therefore, until vaccination rates are very high, continued layered controls and tight-fitting masks and respirators will be necessary. Key PointsO_LICases exhale infectious viral aerosols C_LIO_LISARS-CoV-2 evolution favors more efficient aerosol generation. C_LIO_LILoose-fitting masks moderately reduce viral RNA aerosol.

There are well-documented advantages in terms of quicker visual rehabilitation and reduced costs. The risk of bilateral simultaneous endophthalmitis and bilateral blindness is now recognized to be minuscule with the advent of intracameral antibiotics and modern management of endophthalmitis. Refractive surprises are rare for normal eyes and with the use of optical biometry. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, all elective surgeries were stopped. This has resulted in a large backlog of deferred cataract surgeries.

Starting from risk factors, women are more likely to be susceptible to unhealthy behaviors and risk factors that have different impact on CV morbidity and mortality compared to men. Despite the large body of evidence as regards the effect of lifestyle factors on the CVD onset, the gender-specific effect of traditional and non-traditional risk factors on the prognosis of patients with already established CVD has not been well investigated and understood. Furthermore, CVD in women is often misdiagnosed, underestimated and undertreated. Women also experience hormonal changes from adolescence till elder life that affect CV physiology. Unfortunately, in most of the clinical trials women are under-represented, leading to limited knowledge of CV and systemic impact effects of several treatment modalities on women's health. Thus, in this consensus a group of female Cardiologists from the Hellenic Society of Cardiology present the special features of CVD in women: the different needs in primary and secondary prevention, as well as therapeutic strategies, that may be implemented in daily clinical practice in order to eliminate underestimation and undertreatment of CVD in female population.","Chrysohoou, Christina; Aggeli, Constantina; Avgeropoulou, Katerina; Aroni, Maria; Bonou, Maria; Boutsikou, Maria; Brili, Stella; Chamodraka, Eftyhia; Dagre, Anna; Flevari, Panagiota; Fountoulaki, Aikaterini; Frogoudaki, Alexandra; Gkouziouta, Aggeliki; Grapsa, Julia; Hatzinikolaou-Kotsakou, Eleni; Kalantzi, Kallirroi; Kitsiou, Anastasia; Kostakou, Panagiota; Kourea, Roy; Koutrolou-Sotiropoulou, Paraskevi; Marketou, Maria; Mavrogeni, Sophie; Naka, Katerina K; Nikolaou, Maria; Papazachou, Ourania; Papavasileiou, Lida Pieretta; Simeonidou, Eftihia; Theopistou, Artemisia; Triantafyllidi, Helen; Trikka, Chrysanthi; Tsekoura, Dorothea; Tzifa, Aphrodite; Vaina, Sophia; Vrettou, Agathi Rosa; Zaglavara, Theodora; Kolovou, Genovefa; Aggelopoulou, Eleni; Antoniou, Anna; Bistola, Vasiliki; Bilianou, Eleni; Boufidou, amp; 913,; malia,; Demerouti, Eftyhia; Giannakopoulou, Vasiliki; Karvouni, Evaggelia; Komnou, Areti; Kyriakou, Panagiota; Limperi, Sotiria; Mavrogianni, Aggeliki; Michalopoulou, Helena; Nakou, Eleni",Hell. j. cardiol,572,16

Underdetection is acknowledged and is problematic when attempting to capture the true prevalence. Seroprevalence studies, where blood samples from a population sample are tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies that react to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, are a common method for estimating the proportion of people previously infected with the virus in a given population. However, obtaining reliable estimates from seroprevalence studies is challenging for a number of reasons, and the uncertainty in the results is often overlooked by scientists, policy makers, and the media. This paper reviews the methodological issues that arise in designing these studies, and the main sources of uncertainty that affect the results. We discuss the choice of study population, recruitment of subjects, uncertainty surrounding the accuracy of antibody tests, and the relationship between antibodies and infection over time. Understanding these issues can help the reader to interpret and critically evaluate the results of seroprevalence studies.","McConnell, D.; Hickey, C.; Bargary, N.; Trela-Larsen, L.; Walsh, C.; Barry, M.; Adams, R.",International Journal of Environmental Research &amp; Public Health [Electronic Resource],572,16

Despite the high relevance for public authorities to adequately address stockpiling behavior, empirical studies on the psychological underpinnings of toilet paper stockpiling are still scarce. In this study, we investigated the relation between personality traits, perceived threat of Covid-19, and stockpiling of toilet paper in an online survey (N = 996) across 22 countries. Results suggest that people who felt more threatened by Covid-19 stockpiled more toilet paper. Further, a predisposition towards Emotionality predicted the perceived threat of Covid-19 and affected stockpiling behavior indirectly. Finally, Conscientiousness was related to toilet paper stockpiling, such that individuals higher in Conscientiousness tended to stockpile more toilet paper. These results emphasize the importance of clear communication by public authorities acknowledging anxiety and, at the same time, transmitting a sense of control.","Garbe, Lisa; Rau, Richard; Toppe, Theo",PLoS One,572,13

Experimentally infected camelids clear infectious virus within one week and mount an effective adaptive immune response. Here, transcription of immune response genes was monitored in the respiratory tract of MERS-CoV infected alpacas. Concomitant to the peak of infection, occurring at 2 days post inoculation (dpi), type I and III interferons (IFNs) were maximally transcribed only in the nasal mucosa of alpacas, while interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) were induced along the whole respiratory tract. Simultaneous to mild focal infiltration of leukocytes in nasal mucosa and submucosa, upregulation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10 and dampened transcription of pro-inflammatory genes under NF-&#954;B control were observed. In the lung, early (1 dpi) transcription of chemokines (CCL2 and CCL3) correlated with a transient accumulation of mainly mononuclear leukocytes. A tight regulation of IFNs in lungs with expression of ISGs and controlled inflammatory responses, might contribute to virus clearance without causing tissue damage. Thus, the nasal mucosa, the main target of MERS-CoV in camelids, seems central in driving an efficient innate immune response based on triggering ISGs as well as the dual anti-inflammatory effects of type III IFNs and IL10.","Te, Nigeer; Rodon, Jordi; Ballester, Maria; Pérez, Mónica; Pailler-García, Lola; Segalés, Joaquim; Vergara-Alert, Júlia; Bensaid, Albert",PLoS Pathog,572,16

We examine this proposition by analyzing COVID-19-related deaths globally across countries led by men and women. While we find some limited support for lower reported fatality rates in countries led by women, they are not statistically significant. Country cultural values offer more substantive explanation for COVID-19 outcomes. We offer several potential explanations for the pervasive perception that countries led by women have fared better during the pandemic, including data selection bias and Western media bias that amplified the successes of women leaders in OECD countries.","Windsor, Leah C; Yannitell Reinhardt, Gina; Windsor, Alistair J; Ostergard, Robert; Allen, Susan; Burns, Courtney; Giger, Jarod; Wood, Reed",PLoS One,572,20

Nonetheless, the effectiveness of student collaboration depends on the extent that these interactions take place under conditions that favor commitment, trust, and decision-making among those who interact. The sanitary situation and the transition to remote teaching has added new challenges for collaboration given that students' interactions are mediated by Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). In this study we explore the effectiveness of different collaborative relationships on physics and mathematics, from a sample of secondary students from two schools located in rural and urban areas in southern Chile. We used Social Network Analysis (SNA) to map students' friendships relations, academic prestige, and collaboration on both courses. Later we combined the collaboration network with friendship and academic prestige on the course, to separate strong from weak friendship working ties, and those among students who enjoy or not academic prestige. Multiple linear regression models showed, on average, positive effects of collaboration on grades. Yet, when isolating the effects of the types of collaboration, the positive effects are observed only between those who display more strong friendship ties. Also, we found differences on the social networks and their effects over grades between both courses, presumably due to their pedagogical nature. With these results we contribute to the literature of collaboration and its effectiveness based on the nature of students' relationships, and advocate for the importance of instructional design in fostering appropriate motivations and guidelines for constructive collaboration in the classroom.","Pulgar, Javier; Ram'irez, Diego; Umanzor, Abigail; Candia, Cristian; S'anchez, Iv'an",,572,16

One hypothesis is that population in SSA has been exposed to other coronaviruses prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and resulted in some degree of cross-protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis. Our goal was to evaluate this hypothesis by comparing SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive antibodies in pre-pandemic plasma samples collected from SSA and USA. METHOD: Pre-COVID-19 pandemic plasma samples from SSA and USA were collected and tested by immunofluorescence assay against the spike and nucleocapid proteins of all known human coronaviruses (HCoV). RESULTS: Significantly higher prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 serological cross-reactivity was detected in samples from SSA compared to USA. Majority of these cross-reactive samples cross-recognized SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein together with recognition of spike proteins from other HCoVs. Since nucleocapsid proteins from HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E were detected by majority of samples, it implicates prior exposure to these two HCoVs as the likely source for cross-reactive antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: Low SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease in SSA appears to correlate with pre-pandemic serological cross-recognition of HCoVs, which are substantially more prevalent in SSA than USA.","Tso, For Yue; Lidenge, Salum J; Peña, Phoebe B; Clegg, Ashley A; Ngowi, John R; Mwaiselage, Julius; Ngalamika, Owen; Julius, Peter; West, John T; Wood, Charles",Int. j. infect. dis,572,16

OBJECTIVE: To identify contextual factors relevant to the conduct of a definitive clinical trial evaluating a prone positioning strategy for non-intubated hypoxic patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a cluster randomized pilot trial at a quaternary care teaching hospital. Five inpatient medical service teams were randomly allocated to two treatment arms: 1) usual care (UC) consisting of current, standard management of hypoxia and COVID-19; or 2) the Awake Prone Positioning Strategy plus usual care (APPS). Included patients had positive SARS-CoV-2 testing or suspected COVID-19 pneumonia and oxygen saturation less than 93% or new oxygen requirement of 3 liters per minute or greater and no contraindications to prone positioning. Oxygenation measures were collected within 48 hours of eligibility and included nadir oxygen saturation to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (S/F) and time spent with S/F ratio less than 315. Concurrently, we conducted an embedded implementation evaluation using semi-structured interviews with clinician and patient participants to determine contextual factors relevant to the successful conduct of a future clinical trial. The primary outcomes were drawn from an implementation science framework including acceptability, adoption, appropriateness, effectiveness, equity, feasibility, fidelity, and penetration. RESULTS: 40 patients were included in the cluster randomized trial. Patients in the Usual Care group (n=13) had a median nadir S/F ratio over the 48-hour study period of 216 [95%CI=95-303] versus 253 [95%CI=197-267] in the APPS group (n=27). Patients in the Usual Care group spent 42 hours [95%CI=13-47] of the 48-hour study period below S/F ratio < 315 versus 20 hours [95%CI=6-39]) for patients in the APPS group. Mixed methods analyses uncovered several barriers relevant to the conduct of a successful definitive RCT, including low adherence to prone positioning, large differences between physician-recommended and patient-tolerated prone durations, and diffusion of prone positioning into usual care. CONCLUSIONS: A definitive trial evaluating the effect of prone positioning in non-intubated patients with COVID-19 is warranted, but several barriers must be addressed to ensure that results of such a trial are informative and readily translated into practice.","Taylor, Stephanie Parks; Bundy, Henry; Smith, William M; Skavroneck, Sara; Taylor, Brice; Kowalkowski, Marc A",Ann.

Total number of patients who took Proteflazid® for preventive purpose was 8,572, including 7,444 medical workers and 1,128 ordinary patients. Indicator ""Number of fatalities"" for the medical institutions providing such information was ""0"". Total number of patients who took Proteflazid® for therapeutic purposes was 433, including 23 medical workers and 410 ordinary patients. Indicator ""Number of fatalities"" for the medical institutions providing such information was ""0"". The total number of medical personnel and patients who used Proteflazid drops for preventive and therapeutic purposes was 9005 people. CONCLUSIONS: The statistical analysis confirmed the effectiveness of the drug Proteflazid® for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19, as, when compared with official actual data, regarding the main indicators of the incidence of COVID-19: there were no fatalities;the average treatment period decreased (1.8 times);the proportion of recovered increased (at least 1.5 times);the proportion of sick medical workers in the total population of sick medical workers decreased (2.2 times);the proportion of patients with a severe course decreased (3.3 times). It can be argued that the drug Proteflazid®, drops has shown high effectiveness in the prevention and treatment of acute respiratory viral infections, including COVID-19, among medical personnel and patients.","Grynevych, O.; Borshov, S.; Matyash, V.; Momotiuk, L.; Motuzka, O.; Yashchenko, L.",Pol Merkur Lekarski,572,15

We here review the publications on the interplay between these two diseases, as available on the article submission day. The preliminary results did not find a conclusive association between asthma and an increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection or severe COVID -19. However, important differences have been found between studies performed in various locations. SARS-CoV-2 infection does not seem to cause asthma exacerbations, and certain typical asthma signs like wheezing were not described in COVID -19 patient series. The susceptibility and risk for COVID -19 in asthma patients may vary according to the patients’ age, asthma severity, asthma control, phenotypes/endotypes, or current treatment. Studies analysing COVID--19 specifically in asthma patients will be required to evaluate the real impact of COVID--19 in asthma.","Carvalho, Jóni Costa; Coutinho, Iolanda Alen; Nunes, Inês; Moura, Ana Luísa; Regateiro, Frederico S.",Rev.

A survey to investigate how the lockdown for COVID-19 impacted on headache in Italian children,16.541634,5.3873987,2020,"Background: Since the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) world pandemic, it has had a significant negative impact on the economy and employment. The orderly resumption of work and production is an important factor in reducing the impact of the COVID-19 and an important guarantee of social and economic stability. The study aimed to investigate the knowledge, attitudes, and practice (KAP) of people returning to work about personal protection under the COVID-19 world pandemic. Methods: During March 2020, based on WeChat, QQ and other internet platforms, online questionnaire survey was conducted by the convenience sampling method. SPSS version 20.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistics analysis. Descriptive statistics and multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to analyze the data. Results: A total of 302 valid questionnaires was collected, and the valid response rate was 86.7%. About knowledge, people who return to work had the highest awareness rate of safe communication distance and the lowest awareness rate of exposure risk levels in different workplaces. The average scores of respondents in different occupations were higher than 95 in terms of personal protective attitude. In terms of practice, the average scores of respondents in different occupations were higher than 90 points. Multiple linear regression results showed that education and place of residence were the influencing factors of knowledge, while gender was the influencing factor of practice. Conclusion: The awareness of prevention and control among the 302 participants was good. There were differences in personal protection knowledge among different occupational groups, but there were no differences in attitude and practice. Our findings were of great significance to improve the pertinence of COVID-19 prevention programs.","Fan, Zhaoya; Mou, Yuanlin; Cheng, Rui; Zhao, Yong; Zhang, Fan",Front Public Health,572,16

The mental health status of individuals could have a negative impact attributed to this global situation. Therefore, this study was intended to explore the symptoms of depression and anxiety among healthcare workers (HCWs) of Pakistan during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was undertaken by administering a web-based questionnaire between May and June 2020. Two tools, including the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), were employed to measure anxiety and depression symptoms among HCWs. The data analyses were carried out using descriptive statistics, Man Whitney, and Kruskal Wallis tests. Results: Of 1094 HCWs who participated in this online survey, 742 (67.8%) were physicians, followed by nurses (n = 277, 25.3%) and pharmacists (n = 75, 6.9%). The survey respondents had a median depression and anxiety score of 5.00 (7.00-3.00) and 8.00 (11.00-5.00), respectively. A considerable number of HCWs (82.2%) utilized online psychological resources to deal with their psychological distress. Female HCWs, nurses, frontline HCWs, and HCWs aged 30-49 years were more likely to suffer from depression and anxiety (p < 0.05). Conclusion: During the recent ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, there is a mild level of symptoms of depression and anxiety among HCWs.

As adult patients have been disproportionately affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, pediatric practitioners world-wide have stepped forward to support their adult colleagues. In general, standalone pediatric hospitals expanded their capacity to centralize pediatric critical care, decanting patients from other institutions. There are few units that ran a hybrid model, managing both adult and pediatric patients with the same PICU staff. In this report, we describe the hybrid model implemented at our respective institutions with shared experiences, pitfalls, challenges, and adjustments required in caring for both young and older patients. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Two PICUs in urban tertiary hospitals in London and New York. PATIENTS: Adult and pediatric patients admitted to the PICU in roughly a 6-week period during the coronavirus disease 2019 surge. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The PICU at King's College Hospital admitted 23 non-coronavirus disease adult patients, while whereas the PICU at Morgan Stanley's Children Hospital in New York admitted 46 adults, 30 of whom were coronavirus disease positive. The median age of adult patients at King's College Hospital was higher than those admitted in New York, 53 years (19-77 yr) and 24.4 years (18-52 yr), respectively. Catering to the different physical, emotional, and social needs of both children and adults by the same PICU team was challenging. One important consideration in both locations was the continued care of patients with severe non-coronavirus disease-related illnesses such as neurosurgical emergencies, trauma, and septic shock. Furthermore, retention of critical specialists such as transplant services allowed for nine and four solid organ transplants to occur in London and New York, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This hybrid model successfully allowed for the expansion into adult critical care while maintaining essential services for critically ill children. Simultaneous care of adults and children in the ICU can be sustained if healthcare professionals work collaboratively, show proactive insight into anticipated issues, and exhibit clear leadership.","Deep, Akash; Knight, Philip; Kernie, Steven G; D039,; Silva, Pam; Sobin, Brittany; Best, Thomas; Zorrilla, Maria; Carson, Lydia; Zoica, Bogdana; Ahn, Danielle",Pediatric critical care medicine,572,24

Mobile radiography is requested when a patient's condition makes it impossible for them to be transported to the radiology department. All health professionals involved in mobile radiography, such as nurses, medical doctors and radiographers should be knowledgeable in this area. This is even more important in current practice, where nurse consultants and nurse advanced practitioners are assessing and referring patients for limited radiological examinations. However, there is little literature to equip nurses with knowledge about mobile radiography. The aim of this article is to raise awareness of this subject at a time when the number of patients requiring mobile radiography has increased globally, due to the outbreak of coronavirus.

Most SARS-CoV-2 studies characterize antibody responses in plasma/sera. While reliable and broadly used, these samples pose several logistical restrictions such as requiring venipuncture for collection and cold chain for transportation and storage. Dried blood spots (DBS) overcome these barriers as they can be self-collected by fingerstick and mailed and stored at ambient temperature. Here, we evaluate the suitability of DBS for SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays by comparing several antibody responses between paired plasma and DBS from SARS-CoV-2 convalescent and vaccinated individuals. We found that DBS not only reflected plasma antibody binding by ELISA and epitope profiles using phage-display, but also yielded SARS-CoV-2 neutralization titers that highly correlated with paired plasma. Neutralization measurement was further streamlined by adapting assays to a high-throughput 384-well format. This study supports the adoption of DBS for numerous SARS-CoV-2 binding and neutralization assays.","Itell, Hannah L.; Weight, Haidyn; Fish, Carolyn S.; Logue, Jennifer K.; Franko, Nicholas; Wolf, Caitlin R.; McCulloch, Denise J.; Galloway, Jared; FrederickA.Matsen, IV; Chu, Helen Y.; Overbaugh, Julie",,572,26

Hand hygiene, social distancing, and the usage of personal protective equipment are considered the most vital tools in controlling the primary transmission of the virus. Converging evidence indicated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and its persistence over several days, which may create secondary transmission of the virus via waterborne and wastewater pathways. Although, researchers have started focusing on this mode of virus transmission, limited knowledge and societal unawareness of the transmission through wastewater may lead to significant increases in the number of positive cases. To emphasize the severe issue of virus transmission through wastewater and create societal awareness, we present a state of the art critical review on transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and the potential remedial strategies to effectively control the viral spread and safeguard society. For low-income countries with high population densities, it is suggested to identify the virus in large scale municipal wastewater plants before following up with one-to-one testing for effective control of the secondary transmission. Ultrafiltration is an effective method for wastewater treatment and usually more than 4 logs of virus removal are achieved while safeguarding good protein permeability. Decentralized wastewater treatment facilities using solar-assisted disinfestation methods are most economical and can be effectively used in hospitals, isolation wards, and medical centers for reducing the risk of transmission from high local concentration sites, especially in tropical countries with abundant solar energy. Disinfection with chlorine, sodium hypochlorite, benzalkonium chloride, and peracetic acid have shown potential in terms of virucidal properties. Biological wastewater treatment using micro-algae will be highly effective in removal of virus and can be incorporated into membrane bio-reaction to achieve excellent virus removal rate. Though promising results have been shown by initial research for inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater using physical, chemical and biological based treatment methods, there is a pressing need for extensive investigation of COVID-19 specific disinfectants with appropriate concentrations, their environmental implications, and regular monitoring of transmission. Effective wastewater treatment methods with high virus removal capacity and low treatment costs should be selected to control the virus spread and safeguard society from this deadly virus.","Thakur, Amrit Kumar; Sathyamurthy, Ravishankar; Velraj, R; Lynch, I; Saidur, R; Pandey, A K; Sharshir, Swellam W; Kabeel, Abd Elnaby; Hwang, Jang-Yeon; GaneshKumar, P",J Environ Manage,572,16

This article describes a nurse-led educational program that transitioned to fully online delivery to prepare interprofessional teams of health care students to use telehealth during the pandemic and beyond. METHOD: Participants included 67 students from seven professions. Researchers developed ""the four Ps of telehealth"" model to guide the curriculum. The program used pre- and postassessments including the Confidence in Planning for Telehealth Scale, the Telehealth Etiquette Knowledge Scale, and the Confidence in Providing Telehealth Scale. RESULTS: There were significant improvements in scores on all scales following the program (p = .000). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that comprehensive telehealth education should focus on more than just delivering telehealth but also planning and preparing for its delivery. Programs such as this online program can serve as a model for future telehealth programs to prepare providers.

The ease of its propagation, coupled with its high capacity for illness and death in infected individuals, makes it a hazard to the community. Chest X-rays are one of the most common but most difficult to interpret radiographic examination for early diagnosis of coronavirus-related infections. They carry a considerable amount of anatomical and physiological information, but it is sometimes difficult even for the expert radiologist to derive the related information they contain. Automatic classification using deep learning models can help in better assessing these infections swiftly. Deep CNN models, namely, MobileNet, ResNet50, and InceptionV3, were applied with different variations, including training the model from the start, fine-tuning along with adjusting learned weights of all layers, and fine-tuning with learned weights along with augmentation. Fine-tuning with augmentation produced the best results in pretrained models. Out of these, two best-performing models (MobileNet and InceptionV3) selected for ensemble learning produced accuracy and FScore of 95.18% and 90.34%, and 95.75% and 91.47%, respectively. The proposed hybrid ensemble model generated with the merger of these deep models produced a classification accuracy and FScore of 96.49% and 92.97%. For test dataset, which was separately kept, the model generated accuracy and FScore of 94.19% and 88.64%. Automatic classification using deep ensemble learning can help radiologists in the correct identification of coronavirus-related infections in chest X-rays. Consequently, this swift and computer-aided diagnosis can help in saving precious human lives and minimizing the social and economic impact on society.","Ahmad, Fareed; Farooq, Amjad; Ghani, Muhammad Usman",Comput Intell Neurosci,572,1

FRET-based biosensors with spectrally distinct fluorophore pairs provide clear contrast between cells during dual FRET live cell imaging. Here, we have developed a new FRET-based Ca2+ biosensor using EGFP and FusionRed fluorophores (FRET-GFPRed). Using different filter settings, the developed biosensor can be differentiated from a typical FRET-based Ca2+ biosensor with ECFP and YPet (YC3.6 FRET Ca2+ biosensor, FRET-CFPYPet). A high-frequency ultrasound (HFU) with a carrier frequency of 150 MHz can target a subcellular region due to its tight focus smaller than 10 µm. Therefore, HFU offers a new single cell stimulations approach for FRET live cell imaging with precise spatial resolution and repeated stimulation for longitudinal studies. Furthermore, the single cell level intracellular delivery of a desired FRET-based biosensor into target cells using HFU enables us to perform dual FRET imaging of a cell pair. We show that a cell pair is defined by sequential intracellular delivery of the developed FRET-GFPRed and FRET-CFPYPet into two target cells using HFU. We demonstrate that a FRET-GFPRed exhibits consistent 10-15% FRET response under typical ionomycin stimulation as well as under a new stimulation strategy with HFU.","Yoon, Sangpil; Pan, Yijia; Shung, Kirk; Wang, Yingxiao",,572,16

After the virus first emerged in late 2019, the first intervention that demonstrated significant reductions in mortality for severe COVID-19 in large-scale trials was corticosteroids. Additional options that may reduce the burden on the healthcare system by reducing the number of patients requiring intensive care unit support are desperately needed, yet no therapy has conclusively established benefit in randomized studies for the management of moderate or mild cases of disease. Severe COVID-19 disease is characterized by a respiratory distress syndrome accompanied by elevated levels of several systemic cytokines, in a profile that shares several features with known inflammatory pathologies such as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and cytokine release syndrome secondary to chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy. Based on these observations, modulation of inflammatory cytokines, particularly interleukin (IL)-6, was proposed as a strategy to mitigate severe disease. Despite encouraging recoveries with anti-IL-6 agents, especially tocilizumab from single-arm studies, early randomized trials returned mixed results in terms of clinical benefit with these interventions. Later, larger trials such as RECOVERY and REMAP-CAP, however, are establishing anti-IL-6 in combination with steroids as a potential option for hypoxic patients with evidence of hyperinflammation. We propose that a positive feedback loop primarily mediated by macrophages and monocytes initiates the inflammatory cascade in severe COVID-19, and thus optimal benefit with anti-IL-6 therapies may require intervention during a finite window of opportunity at the outset of hyperinflammation but before fulminant disease causes irreversible tissue damage-as defined clinically by C reactive protein levels higher than 75 mg/L.","Ascierto, Paolo Antonio; Fu, Binqing; Wei, Haiming",J. immunotherap. cancer,572,20

By modulating key transcription factors, BTK may regulate macrophage polarization downstream of classic M1 and M2 polarizing stimuli and mitigate the hyperinflammatory state associated with COVID-19. In favor of BTKi discontinuation, we note a potentially increased risk of secondary infections and impaired humoral immunity.

However, the amount of hip fractures has remained relatively stable throughout the period. The objective of this study is to investigate the impact of perioperative COVID-19 infections on mortality among hip fracture patients. METHODS: A meta-analysis was performed by collecting current data available through a systematic literature search in the PubMed database. The search was performed Oct 18 2020. RESULTS: The meta-analysis was conducted on a trial population consisting of 1.272 hip fracture patients with a pooled prevalence of COVID-19 of 18%. Mortality among hip fracture patients without a perioperative COVID-19 infection was 7.49%. Mortality among hip fracture patients infected with COVID-19 perioperatively was associated with an odds ratio of 6.70 [(95% CI 4.64-9.68), p < 0.00001, I2 = 41%]. A sensitivity analysis showed no major impact of assumptions regarding varying definitions of COVID-19 statuses among the included studies. CONCLUSION: Perioperative infections with COVID-19 in hip fracture patients are correlated with a significantly increased mortality.

Within three months, it evolved to 10 additional subtypes. Two evolved subtypes (A2 and A2a) carry a non-synonymous Spike protein mutation (D614G). We conducted phylodynamic analysis of over 70,000 SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses worldwide, sequenced until July2020, and found that the mutant subtype (614G) outcompeted the pre-existing type (614D), significantly faster in Europe and North-America than in East Asia. Bioinformatically and computationally, we identified a novel neutrophil elastase (ELANE) cleavage site introduced in the G-mutant, near the S1-S2 junction of the Spike protein. We hypothesised that elevation of neutrophil elastase level at the site of infection will enhance the activation of Spike protein thus facilitating host cell entry for 614G, but not the 614D, subtype. The level of neutrophil elastase in the lung is modulated by its inhibitor &#945;1-antitrypsin (AAT). AAT prevents lung tissue damage by elastase. However, many individuals exhibit genotype-dependent deficiency of AAT. AAT deficiency eases host-cell entry of the 614G virus, by retarding inhibition of neutrophil elastase and consequently enhancing activation of the Spike protein. AAT deficiency is highly prevalent in European and North-American populations, but much less so in East Asia. Therefore, the 614G subtype is able to infect and spread more easily in populations of the former regions than in the latter region. Our analyses provide a molecular biological and evolutionary model for the higher observed virulence of the 614G subtype, in terms of causing higher morbidity in the host (higher infectivity and higher viral load), than the non-mutant 614D subtype.","Bhattacharyya, Chandrika; Das, Chitrarpita; Ghosh, Arnab; Singh, Animesh K; Mukherjee, Souvik; Majumder, Partha P; Basu, Analabha; Biswas, Nidhan K",Infect Genet Evol,572,21

The question to be explored was: Are there discernible differences in sleep between the normal operational environment and the stay-at-home condition? METHODS: This international prospective study analyzed results from the sleep-wake patterns questionnaire, daily logs, and interviews. Surveys were administered to the healthy volunteers (age 15-60 y) with stay-at-home for a month or more, without previous sleep disorders and mood-related complaints; volunteers were not involved in online education/work daily timetable-related activities. RESULTS: We analyzed 3787 subjects with average stay-at-home of 65 ± 9 days. The most significant changes in sleep occurred during the first ten days when the difference between weekdays and weekends disappeared and changes occurred in napping habits. The majority of the participants (66.8%) shifted toward eveningness when the self-selected sleep was possible and 1869 volunteers appeared to be owls (49.4%), 823 (21.7%) exercised ""typical"" sleep, 478 (12.6%) were larks, and 617 (16.3%) participants were completely desynchronized to the end of stay-at-home. In addition, 497 participants (13.1%) alternated their sleep habits. The most of the desynchronized participants (n = 414) were older than 50 years (age correlation r = 0.80), and predominantly males (n = 297, r = 0.76). CONCLUSION: In self-selected sleep conditions, the timing of sleep and sleep habits significantly differ from those of socially and economically fixed daily routine conditions. The changes in daily temporal patterns of humans during a prolonged stay-at-home situation indicate that human sleep habits may change according to existing living conditions.","Roitblat, Yulia; Burger, Jacob; Vaiman, Michael; Nehuliaieva, Liliia; Buchris, Noa; Shterenshis, Michael",Sleep medicine,572,5

Our framing draws on new materialism, and builds the idea of liveliness by considering robots’ agential capacities in three different ways: as apparently autonomous technologies;as inorganic and mechanical bodies;and as perpetually unfinished and contingent things. We examine a range of examples of their deployment during the pandemic to speculate on the potential for robots to emerge as ‘caring subjects’ via this notion of liveliness, and argue that it offers an approach that can contribute to critiques about their use in ‘caring’ roles, an application which is rapidly developing in the area of social robotics. We contend that this claim to ‘care’ within robotics is one reason why exploration and framing of their liveliness is needed.

Hence, a meta-analysis was performed to evaluate whether the presence of an MP component has equal prognostic power as the MP predominant subtype. METHODS: Literature retrieval was performed in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases until December 23, 2019. Eligible studies were selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The included studies were divided into two subgroups, the MP component subgroup and the MP predominant subgroup, according to the proportion of the MP pattern to analyse the effect of this pattern on disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). The hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were extracted from each study. Review Manager 5.3 was used for statistical analyses. RESULTS: Finally, 10 studies, including a total of 4934 lung ADC patients, were included in this meta-analysis. Our results indicated a significantly worse pooled DFS (HR 1.62, 95% CI 1.20-2.21) and OS (HR 1.53, 95% CI 1.19-1.96) in the subgroup of MP predominant subtype patients. The pooled DFS (HR 1.80, 95% CI 1.45-2.85) and OS (HR 2.26, 95% CI 1.46-3.52) were also poor in the subgroup of patients with the presence of an MP component. CONCLUSIONS: Both the presence of an MP component and the MP predominant subtype are related to poor DFS and OS after lung ADC resection and represent adverse prognostic factor for lung ADC patients. However, there are some limitations in this meta-analysis, and quantitative stratification based on the proportion of the MP component is needed to explore its effect on prognosis of lung ADC patients in the future.","Wang, Wei; Hu, Zaoxiu; Zhao, Jie; Huang, Yunchao; Rao, Sunyin; Yang, Jichen; Xiao, Shouyong; Cao, Run; Ye, Lianhua",J Cardiothorac Surg,572,6

For this reason, annual vaccination against influenza is generally recommended for all healthcare workers, thereby embracing the twin principles of beneficence and non-maleficence. The cost and burden of influenza vaccination is minimal, and it has been argued that employing institutions are under an obligation to ensure that employees are universally vaccinated. Presenteeism, i.e. reporting for work when unwell, is another significant cause of nosocomial infection and may easily occur as even in the hypothetical ideal situation of 100% vaccination coverage, the influenza vaccine is not 100% effective.

We investigated the association between COVID-19 and stroke. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study involving patients discharged from a healthcare system in New York State, from January to April 2020. A mixed-effects logistic regression analysis and a propensity score-weighted analysis were used to control for confounders and investigate the association of COVID-19 with ischemic stroke. Similar techniques were used to detect the impact of concurrent COVID-19 infection on unfavorable outcomes for patients with stroke. RESULTS: Among 24 808 discharges, 2513 (10.1%) were diagnosed with COVID-19, and 566 (0.2%) presented with acute ischemic stroke. Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were at one-quarter the odds of stroke compared with other patients (odds ratio, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.16-0.40]). This association was consistent in all age groups. Our results were robust in sensitivity analyses, including propensity score-weighted regression models. In patients presenting with stroke, concurrent infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was associated with higher case-fatality (odds ratio, 10.50 [95% CI, 3.54-31.18]) and a trend towards increased occurrence of discharge to rehabilitation (odds ratio, 2.45 [95% CI, 0.81-1.25]). CONCLUSIONS: Using a comprehensive cross-section of patients from a large NY-based healthcare system, we did not identify a positive association between ischemic stroke and COVID-19. However, patients with stroke with COVID-19 had worse outcomes compared with those without, with over a 9-fold increase in mortality. Although no definitive conclusions can be reached from our observational study, our data do not support the concerns for an epidemic of stroke in young adults with COVID-19.","Bekelis, Kimon; Missios, Symeon; Ahmad, Javaad; Labropoulos, Nicos; Schirmer, Clemens M; Calnan, Daniel R; Skinner, Jonathan; MacKenzie, Todd A",Stroke,572,2

METHODS: We performed a literature review in medical databases. Overall, 143 articles were initially retrieved, out of which 48 were selected and included in the review. RESULTS: Our review retrieved similar data in many countries worldwide, and, globally, preliminary data from the first four months of 2020 indicate a decline in diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis coverage, generally considered the marker of vaccination coverage across countries. World Health Organization recommends maintaining vaccination services, prioritizing primary series vaccinations especially for measles-rubella or poliomyelitis, but it also lets each country decide whether to maintain the immunisation services evaluating the current epidemiology of vaccine-preventable diseases and the COVID-19 local transmission scenario. Successively, recovering of vaccinations should be planned. Moreover, during the pandemic, influenza vaccination should be promoted as a central public health measure. CONCLUSION: Future challenges will be to maintain the vaccination programs, especially in children younger than two years old and adolescents, to plan the recovery of vaccinations for subjects who postponed them during the lock-down, and to early identify any vaccine-preventable disease outbreak.","Chiappini, Elena; Parigi, Sara; Galli, Luisa; Licari, Amelia; Brambilla, Ilaria; Tosca, Maria Angela; Ciprandi, Giorgio; Marseglia, Gianluigi",Acta paediatr. scand,572,16

Approximately 20% of patients with COVID-19 develop severe disease and 5% of patients require intensive care2. Severe disease has been associated with changes in peripheral immune activity, including increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines3,4 that may be produced by a subset of inflammatory monocytes5,6, lymphopenia7,8 and T cell exhaustion9,10. To elucidate pathways in peripheral immune cells that might lead to immunopathology or protective immunity in severe COVID-19, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to profile peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from seven patients hospitalized for COVID-19, four of whom had acute respiratory distress syndrome, and six healthy controls. We identify reconfiguration of peripheral immune cell phenotype in COVID-19, including a heterogeneous interferon-stimulated gene signature, HLA class II downregulation and a developing neutrophil population that appears closely related to plasmablasts appearing in patients with acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Importantly, we found that peripheral monocytes and lymphocytes do not express substantial amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Collectively, we provide a cell atlas of the peripheral immune response to severe COVID-19.","Wilk, Aaron J; Rustagi, Arjun; Zhao, Nancy Q; Roque, Jonasel; Martínez-Colón, Giovanny J; McKechnie, Julia L; Ivison, Geoffrey T; Ranganath, Thanmayi; Vergara, Rosemary; Hollis, Taylor; Simpson, Laura J; Grant, Philip; Subramanian, Aruna; Rogers, Angela J; Blish, Catherine A",Nat Med,572,24

However, till date, no specific treatment modalities are available for Covid-19 and also not much information is known about this disease. Recent studies have revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with the generation of thrombosis and coagulopathy. Fundamentally, it has been believed that a diverse array of signalling pathways might be responsible for the activation of coagulation cascade during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Henceforth, a detailed understanding of these probable underlying molecular mechanistic pathways causing thrombosis in Covid-19 disease deserves an urgent exploration. Therefore, in this review, the hypothetical crosstalk between distinct signalling pathways including apoptosis, inflammation, hypoxia and angiogenesis attributable for the commencement of thrombotic events during SARS-CoV-2 infection has been addressed which might further unravel promising therapeutic targets in Covid-19 disease.","Goyal, Anmol; Prasad, Rajendra; Goel, Parul; Pal, Amit; Prasad, Suvarna; Rani, Isha",Indian J Clin Biochem,572,1

METHODS: Retrospective observational study performed in four university affiliated hospitals in Paris. AKI was defined according to the KIDGO guidelines. Factors associated with AKI were picked up using multivariable mixed-effects logistic regression. Independent risk factors of day 28 mortality were assessed using Cox model. RESULTS: 379 patients (median age 62 [53,69], 77% of male) were included. Half of the patients had AKI (n = 195, 52%) including 58 patients (15%) with AKI stage 1, 44 patients (12%) with AKI stage 2, and 93 patients (25% with AKI stage 3). Chronic kidney disease (OR 7.41; 95% CI 2.98-18.4), need for invasive mechanical ventilation at day 1 (OR 4.83; 95% CI 2.26-10.3), need for vasopressors at day 1 (OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.05-4.21) were associated with increased risk of AKI. Day 28 mortality in the cohort was 26.4% and was higher in patients with AKI (37.4 vs. 14.7%, P < 0.001).

During the early COVID-19 period, Lebanon followed an aggressive containment approach to halt the spread of the disease. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the impact of the different national containment measures and the early COVID-19 outbreak in Lebanon on ED visit volume and disease spectrum in a single center ED in Lebanon. METHODS: This study is a secondary analysis of ED visit administrative data, comparing ED visits during the three months period prior to the first identified COVID-19 case in Lebanon with the first 3 months post-COVID-19. A time series analysis of ED visit trends in relation to the major lockdown measures was conducted. Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS, version 27) and STATA version 15 (StataCorp LLC., College Station,TX). Statistical significance was set at 0.05. RESULTS: The daily ED visit volume significantly decreased in response to the closure of educational institutions (19.96% per day, p-value = 0.04) and the declaration of public mobilization state with border closure (97.11% per day, p-value <0.0001). ED visits decreased by 47.2% post-COVID-19. The drop was highest amongst pediatric patients (66.64%). Patients who presented post-COVID-19, compared to pre-COVID-19 were older (40.39 ± 24.96 vs 33.71 ± 24.83, p-value <0.0001), had higher hospital admission rates (28.8% vs. 22.1%, p-value <0.0001), higher critical care admission rates (5.6% vs. 3.5%, p-value <0.001), and double mortality rate (0.4% vs 0.2%, p-value = 0.006). While visits for most diseases dropped, the odds of presenting to the ED post-COVID19 were higher for bacterial infections and non-communicable disease and lower for injuries and communicable diseases. CONCLUSION: ED visits dropped significantly during the COVID-19 containment period. Understanding the trends of changes in disease entities is important for ED staffing purposes during the pandemic and the varying containment efforts. While stringent lockdown measures were associated with drops in ED visits, understanding the reason behind these drops, specifically whether behavioral or related to true drops in disease prevalence, needs further exploration.","Mahmassani, Dina; Tamim, Hani; Makki, Maha; Hitti, Eveline",Am. j. emerg. med,572,22

This displacement of medical students from wards has limited experiential learning. Concurrently, outpatient practices are experiencing reduced volumes of in-person visits and are shifting towards virtual healthcare, a transition that comes with its own logistical challenges. This article describes a workflow that enabled medical students to engage in meaningful clinical education while helping an institution's outpatient practices implement remote telemedicine visits. METHODS: A 4-week virtual elective was designed to allow clinical learners to participate in virtual telemedicine patient encounters. Students were prepared with EMR training and introduced to a novel workflow that supported healthcare providers in the outpatient setting. Patients were consented to telehealth services before encounters with medical students. All collected clinical information was documented in the EMR, after which students transitioned patients to a virtual Doxy.me video appointment. Surveys were used to evaluate clinical and educational outcomes of students' participation. Elective evaluations and student reflections were also collected. RESULTS: Survey results showed students felt well-prepared to initiate patient encounters. They expressed comfort while engaging with patients virtually during telemedicine appointments. Students identified clinical educational value, citing opportunities to develop patient management plans consistent with in-person experiences. A significant healthcare burden was also alleviated by student involvement. Over 1000 total scheduled appointments were serviced by students who transitioned more than 80 % of patients into virtual attending provider waiting rooms. CONCLUSIONS: After piloting this elective with fourth-year students, pre-clerkship students were also recruited to act in a role normally associated with clinical learners (e.g., elicit patient histories, conduct a review of systems, etc.). Furthermore, additional telemedicine electives are being designed so medical students can contribute to patient care without risk of exposure to COVID-19. These efforts will allow students to continue with their clinical education during the pandemic. Medical educators can adopt a similar workflow to suit evolving remote learning needs.","Weber, Alec M; Dua, Anoushka; Chang, Kitae; Jupalli, Hamsitha; Rizwan, Farsha; Chouthai, Abhishek; Chen, Catherine",BMC Med Educ,572,21

The transmissibility of the coronavirus from asymptomatic patients to healthy individuals has received enormous attention. An important study using COVID-19 data from the city of Ningbo, China, was carried out to estimate and compare the transmission rates of the coronavirus by the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. However, in the original analysis, the usual chi-square tests were unduly used for some contingency tables with small cell counts including zero, which may violate the assumptions for the chi-square test. OBJECTIVE: We reanalyze the data from the city of Ningbo with more appropriate statistical methods to draw more reliable and sound conclusions on the transmission rates of the coronavirus by the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. METHODS: We excluded the cases associated with the super-spreader and adopted a more appropriate statistical method, including the permutation test and the Fisher exact test, to reanalyze the COVID-19 data from the city of Ningbo. RESULTS: After excluding the cases related to the super-spreader, the Fisher exact test yields a P value of .84, which indicates stronger evidence of no difference in the transmission rates compared with the original analysis. The odds ratio of the coronavirus transmission rates between the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients is 1.2 with a 95% confidence interval 0.5-2.8. CONCLUSIONS: Through a more in-depth and comprehensive statistical analysis of the Ningbo data, we concluded that there is no difference in the transmission rates of coronavirus between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.","Yin, Guosheng; Jin, Huaqing",JMIR Public Health Surveill,572,21

The aim of this study was to apply a previous published methodology to design food exchange lists to the development of a sports food exchange list, with sport products available in Spain. A cross-sectional study of the nutritional composition of sports foods, regarding macronutrients and energy, was carried out. A total of 322 sports foods from 18 companies were selected, taking into account their interest in sports practice and with nutritional data provided by companies. Sports foods were divided into seven groups: sports drinks; sports gels; sports bars; sports confectionery; protein powders; protein bars; and liquid meals. A sports food composition database based on portion size usually consumed by athletes and/or recommended in commercial packaging was created. Within each sports foods group, different subgroups were defined due to differences in the main and/or secondary macronutrient. The definition of each exchange list with the amounts-in grams-of each sports food within each group and subgroup, was done using statistical criteria such as mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, and Z value. Final exchange values for energy and macronutrient have been established for each group and subgroup using a methodology to design food exchange lists previously published by the authors. In addition, those products with high Z values that can provide greater variability in dietary planning were included. The usefulness of sport foods lists as well as the use of an exchange system in the dietary practice of sports nutrition is discussed, and examples of how to use them with athletes are presented. This first sport foods exchange list showed in this study, with commercial sports products available in Spain, can be a novel tool for dietetic practice and also can allow sport nutrition professionals to develop another sport food list using the methodology described in this paper. Its management would allow dietitians to adapt dietary plans more precisely to the training and/or competition of the athlete.","Martínez-Sanz, José Miguel; Menal-Puey, Susana; Sospedra, Isabel; Russolillo, Giuseppe; Norte, Aurora; Marques-Lopes, Iva",Nutrients,572,10

Therefore, this survey was conducted to investigate the prevalence and related factors of depressive, anxiety, acute stress, and insomnia symptoms in medical staffs in Kashi, Xinjiang, China during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among medical staffs working in First People's Hospital of Kashi, Xinjiang. The questionnaire collected demographic data and self-design questions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Impact of Events Scale-6, the Insomnia Severity Index, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7, the Perceived Social Support Scale, the Chinese Big Five Personality Inventory-15, and the Trait Coping Style Questionnaire were used to measure psychological symptoms or characteristics. Binary logistic regression was carried out to examine the associations between socio-demographic factors and symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, and insomnia. In total, data from 123 participants were finally included, among which the prevalence rate of depressive, anxiety, acute stress, and insomnia symptoms is 60.2, 49.6, 43.1, and 41.1%, respectively. The regression model revealed that minority ethnicity, being worried about infection, spending more time on following pandemic information, and neurotic personality were positively associated with the mental health symptoms, while extraversion personality, higher education level, and better social support were negatively associated. In our study, the prevalence of mental health impact was high among medical staffs in Kashi, China who experienced the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Several factors were found to be associated with mental health conditions. These findings could help identify medical staffs at risk for mental health problems and be helpful for making precise mental health intervention policies during the resurgence.

And first, it concerned the legal regulation of labour relations, which has undergone quite fundamental changes, which today form a new, more modern system of functioning of the labour market. Businesses may indeed violate employees' rights and protection from completely unwarranted resignation and even to gain adequate justice and national government aid. Workers with informal employment agreements, and limited access to healthcare and social protection before the pandemic, are particularly at risk now. The present research paper describes the relevant questions in Employment law, which relate to the Covid-19 pandemic in Ukraine and Europe. Some workers' right to engage in work may disproportionately suffer due to the restrictions in place. These include parents of young children and single parent families, employees with health issues and disabilities, and migrant workers transported to work in agriculture or to provide social care. There is also concern about fair and just working conditions. This paper aims to answer the main questions connected with the Employment law in Covid time by conducting a literature review covering legal amendments to national and international legislations and examining the foreign practice related to employees' rights connected with the labour restrictions in the time of pandemic.","Volodymyrovych, K.

Methods Python crawler automatic update function was used to collect the epidemic data released by the National Health Commission of China. An improved infectious disease dynamics SEIR model, which can automatically correct the COVID-19 basic reproductive number (R0), was constructed to predict the development trend of COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei Province of China and South Korea. Results The peak of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei Province of China predicted by the model would appear on Feb. 21, 2020. The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases would be about 50 000 on Feb. 19 and would fall to below 30 000 on Mar. 4, and the epidemic would end on May 10. According to the actual data released by the National Health Commission of China, the peak number of confirmed COVID-19 patients was 53 371. The model predicted that an epidemic peak in South Korea would be on Mar. 7, and would end at the end of April. Conclusion This improved infectious disease dynamics SEIR model established in the early stage of COVID-19 epidemic has achieved relatively accurate prediction. The timely and effective intervention by relevant government departments has significantly affected the development of the epidemic. The epidemic situation in other countries in East Asia, such as South Korea, is still on the rise in March, suggesting that China needs to be on guard against the risk of imported epidemic.","Si-Yuan, Wang; Han-Lin, Tan; Dong-Jie, Li",Acad.

Self-harm and suicide are its extreme effects. We aim to explore the impact of this pandemic on suicide and self-harm in our Emergency Department. A cross-sectional study was conducted including all fatal and nonfatal self-harm patients presenting to the emergency department during the lockdown period (March 24-June 23, 2020; Period1), matching periods in the previous year (March 24-June 23,2019; Period 2) and 3 months period prior (December 24 2019-March 23, 2020; Period 3) were included through the electronic medical record system. The prevalence and the clinical profile were compared between these three periods. A total of 125 (periods 1 = 55, 2 = 38, and 3 = 32) suicide and self-harm cases were analyzed. Suicide and self-harm had increased by 44% and 71.9% during the lockdown in comparison to periods 2 and 3. Organophosphate poisoning was the most common mode. Females were predominant in all three periods with a mean age of 32 (95%CI: 29.3-34.7). There was a significant delay in arrival of the patients in period 1 (p = 0.045) with increased hospital admission (p = 0.003) and in-hospital mortality (18.2% vs 2.6% and 3.1%) (p<0.001). Our study showed an increase in suicide and self-harm cases in the emergency department during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic which may reflect the increased mental health crisis in the community in low resource settings like Nepal. This study highlights the importance of priming all mental health care stakeholders to initiate mental health screening and intervention for the vulnerable population during this period of crisis.","Shrestha, Roshana; Siwakoti, Shisir; Singh, Saumya; Shrestha, Anmol Purna",PLoS One,572,8

Here we report the case of a patient with sporadic adult-onset ataxia (SAOA) who underwent allogeneic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy via the intrathecal route. A 60-year-old male patient visited our clinic complaining of progressive gait disturbance that commenced two years ago. Upon neurologic examination, the patient exhibited limb dysmetria and gait ataxia. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed cerebellar atrophy whereas the autonomic function test was normal. The patient was diagnosed with SAOA. The medications that were initially prescribed had no significant effects on the course of this disease and the symptoms deteriorated progressively. At the age of 64, the patient was treated with allogeneic bone marrow-derived MSC therapy. The subsequent K-SARA (Korean version of the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia) scores demonstrated a distinct improvement up until 10 months post-administration. No adverse events were reported. The improved post-treatment K-SARA scores may suggest that the MSC therapy can have a neuroprotective effect and that stem cell therapy may serve as a potential therapeutic option for degenerative cerebellar ataxia.","Ko, Pan-Woo; Park, Sangmin; Kang, Kyunghun; Lim, Yong-Hyun; Kim, Sang Ryong; Suk, Kyoungho; Kim, Kyung Suk; Lee, Ho-Won",Medicina (Kaunas),572,16

The aim of this review was to study how often and to what extent COVID-19 causes myocardial injury and whether this is an important contributor to outcome with implications for management. METHODS: A literature search was performed in Medline and Embase. Myocardial injury was defined as elevated cardiac troponin (cTn) levels with at least one value >â¯99th percentile of the upper reference limit. The primary outcome measure was mortality, whereas secondary outcome measures were intensive care unit (ICU) admission and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: Four studies and one review were included. The presence of myocardial injury varied between 9.6 and 46.3%. Myocardial injury was associated with a higher mortality rate (risk ratio (RR) 5.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.48-8.80) and more ICU admissions (RR 3.78, 95% CI 2.07-6.89). The results regarding length of hospital stay were inconclusive. CONCLUSION: Patients with myocardial injury might be classified as high-risk patients, with probably a higher mortality rate and a larger need for ICU admission. cTn levels can be used in risk stratification models and can indicate which patients potentially benefit from early medication administration. We recommend measuring cTn levels in all COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospital or who deteriorate during admission.","Habets, M A W; Sturkenboom, H N; Tio, R A; Belfroid, E; Hoogervorst-Schilp, J; Siebelink, H J; Jansen, C W; Smits, P C",Neth Heart J,572,24

about the economy meant putting peopleâ€™s lives at risk It is shown that human capital has long been the basis of modern economic growth and stopping the coronavirus epidemic at any cost is not only ethically correct, but also economically profitable We indicate that the only effective method of containing infection was the General isolation of the population, stopping transport links between

In response to Hooper's book, The River (1999), the Royal Society in London held a conference to debate the origins of HIV. Examination of the quick dismissal of the OPV theory opens a space for legitimately challenging the widely held belief that the vaccine contamination question was convincingly resolved. This article interrogates the relationship between historiography and the making of scientific facts and history, suggesting that historians have been too credulous of scientists' testimony. The further result of the lack of a thorough analysis of the evidence backing the OPV hypothesis has resulted in a missed opportunity to read The River as one of the few detailed accounts of the immense social, political, technological, and interspecies infrastructure constituted by Cold War vaccine production. This biomedical infrastructure dramatically changed the geographic and interspecies mobility of viruses in ways that may be impossible to reconstruct. Yet these potential transmission routes remain crucial to acknowledge. The COVID-19 pandemic draws attention to the critical importance of studying The WetNet, a concept coined by the author to name the conceptual and material infrastructures of inter- and intraspecies fluid bonding.","Jain, S Lochlann",Med. anthropol. q,572,16

Here we propose a rapid microfluidic serological assay with two unique functions of nanointerstice filling and digitized flow control, which enable the fast/robust filling of the sample fluid as well as precise regulation of duration and volume of immune reaction. Developed microfluidic assay showed enhanced limit of detection, and 91.67% sensitivity and 100% specificity (n = 152) for clinical samples of SARS CoV-2 patients. The assay enables daily monitoring of IgM/IgG titers and patterns, which could be crucial parameters for convalescence from COVID-19 and provide important insight into how the immune system responds to SARS CoV-2. The developed on-site microfluidic assay presented the mean time for IgM and IgG seroconversions, indicating that these titers plateaued days after seroconversion. The mean duration from day 0 to PCR negativity was 19.4 days (median 20 d, IQR 16-21 d), with higher IgM/IgG titres being observed when PCR positive turns into negative. Simple monitoring of these titres promotes rapid on-site detection and comprehensive understanding of the immune response of COVID-19 patients.","Lee, Jeong Hoon; Bae, Pan Kee; Kim, Hyunho; Song, Yoon Ji; Yi, So Yeon; Kwon, Jungsun; Seo, Joon-Seok; Lee, Jeong-Min; Jo, Han-Sang; Park, Seon Mee; Park, Hee Sue; Shin, Kyeong Seob; Chung, Seok; Shin, Yong Beom",Biosens Bioelectron,572,14

The experiment was realized by a three-months residential phase in which two tenants lived in the Energy Smart Home Lab, an experimental lab with the equipment of a modern smart home. The tenants received calls to action (CtAs) on a regular basis, incentivized economically or by moral nudges with a social or environmental background. A mixed-methods approach, consisting of smart meter data analysis, a value scale assessment, surveys and interviews, assessed the tenants' reactions on their energy consumption behavior towards the CtAs. The smart meter data shows that the tenants performed the majority of CtAs, revealing no significant difference between economic or non-economic incentives. Results from the value scale, the interviews and the surveys indicate that this behavior might be due to the tenants' high tendency towards biospheric and altruistic values and a high self-efficacy. Furthermore, the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic caused a 100% home-office situation, suggesting a higher flexibility of the tenants. Although the results are not representative and need further experiments to be confirmed, the incentives show a promising potential to evoke residential demand response.","Scharnhorst, L.; Sandmeier, T.; Ardone, A.; Fichtner, W.",Energies,572,26

The existential anxieties associated with the pandemic, as well as people’s responses to them, can be understood and articulated through Sartre’s concept of bad faith. Using this existential lens, we examine the ways in which people’s responses to the virus interact with long-standing societal patterns of interconnection as well as inequity, and how these processes are rooted within the cultural context of late modernity. This analysis reveals that our interconnection simultaneously constitutes the most profound challenges in our psychological response to the pandemic, as well as our greatest source of hope.","Palitsky, Roman; Schmitt, Harrison; Sullivan, Daniel; Young, Isaac F.",J.

Objective: To investigate changes in the daily life and sleeping habits of healthcare professionals in Brazil. Methods: We conducted an observational and cross-sectional study from May to July 2020. A Google Forms questionnaire was made available to Brazilian healthcare professionals on the WhatsApp mobile application and through the website of the Brazilian Hospital Services Company. Results: The sample (n=710) was mostly composed of women (80.8%), aged between 30 and 40 years old (46.6%), predominantly physicians (41.8%) and residing mostly in the state of Paraíba (66.9%), Brazil. Approximately two-thirds of the total sample had some sleep-related complaints, 25.8% due to difficulty initiating sleep, 29.6% due to difficulty staying asleep and 32.5% due to early morning waking. From the population studied, 28.7% (n=204) reported the use of insomnia medication, and 60.3% (n=123) of these were self-medicating.

We analyzed case-data from the United States to investigate effects of temperature, precipitation, and UV Light on community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Daily reported cases of SARS-CoV-2 across the United States from 01/22/2020 to 04/03/2020 were analyzed. We used negative binomial regression modelling to investigate whether daily maximum temperature, precipitation, UV Index and the incidence 5 days later were related. We performed sensitivity analyses at 3 days, 7 days and 9 days to assess transmission lags. RESULTS: A maximum temperature greater than 52°F on a given day was associated with a lower rate of new cases at 5 days[IRR: 0.85(0.76,0.96)p=0.009]. Among observations with daily temperatures below 52°F, there was a significant inverse association between the maximum daily temperature and the rate of cases at 5 days [IRR 0.98(0.97,0.99)p=0.001]. The rate of new cases was predicted to be lower for theoretical states that maintained a stable maximum daily temperature above 52°F with a predicted 23-fewer cases per-million per-day by 25 days of the epidemic. A 1-unit higher UV index was associated with a lower rate at 5 days [IRR 0.97(0.95,0.99)p=0.004]. Precipitation was not associated with a greater rate of cases at 5 days [IRR 0.98(0.89,1.08)p=0.65]. CONCLUSION: The incidence of disease declines with increasing temperature up until 52°F and is lower at warmer versus cooler temperatures. However, the association between temperature and transmission is small and transmission is likely to remain high at warmer temperatures.","Sehra, Shiv T; Salciccioli, Justin D; Wiebe, Douglas J; Fundin, Shelby; Baker, Joshua F",Clin. infect. dis,572,16

Materials and methods An electronic survey was distributed globally to record the operational considerations to mitigate biosafety risks in the laboratory. Additionally, the laboratories were asked to indicate the operational challenges they faced. Results A total of 1210 valid submissions were included in this analysis. Most of the survey participants worked in hospital laboratories. Around 15% of laboratories restricted certain tests on patients with clinically suspected or confirmed COVID-19 over biosafety concerns. Just over 10% of the laboratories had to restrict their test menu or services due to resource constraints. Approximately a third of laboratories performed temperature monitoring, while two thirds of laboratories increased the frequency of disinfection. Just less than 50% of the laboratories split their teams. The greatest reported challenge faced by laboratories during the COVID-19 pandemic is securing sufficient supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE), analytical equipment, including those used at the point of care, as well as reagents, consumables and other laboratory materials. This was followed by having inadequate staff, managing their morale, anxiety and deployment. Conclusions The restriction of tests and services may have undesirable clinical consequences as clinicians are deprived of important information to deliver appropriate care to their patients. Staff rostering and biosafety concerns require longer-term solutions as they are crucial for the continued operation of the laboratory during what may well be a prolonged pandemic.","Loh, Tze Ping; Horvath, Andrea Rita; Wang, Cheng-Bin; Koch, David; Adeli, Khosrow; Mancini, Nicasio; Ferrari, Maurizio; Hawkins, Robert; Sethi, Sunil; Lippi, Giuseppe",Clin. chem. lab. med,572,21

Therefore, wearing eyeglasses more than 8 hours per day may be protective against SARS-CoV-2 infection, possibly because eyeglasses are a barrier that reduces the frequency with which people touch their eyes. The aim of the study was to determine if eyeglasses protect from COVID-19 infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used UK Biobank (UKB) data to corroborate findings of the Hubei study in the UK population. RESULTS: Eyewear was associated with a reduced risk of infection, odds ratio (OR)=0.77. The effects of sex, age, and eyewear were independent and significant at the 95% level. Men are 1.24-times more likely to be infected than women; subjects' risk of infection is less (0.95) for every year of age.

Under such circumstances, individuals tend to resort to non-conventional solutions such as complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) to manage health. Thus, this study aims to examine characteristics of CAM use among outpatients in a community hospital setting during the 2015 MERS outbreak and to assess potential predictors of CAM use during the epidemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 331 patients (response rate: 82.75%) at a community hospital located in Seoul, South Korea. The survey instrument included 36 questions on the use of CAM, demographic characteristics, health status, and respondents' perceptions and concerns about MERS infection. Chi-square test and logistic regression were conducted for data analysis using SPSS ver. 21.0., and a p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant for all analyses. RESULTS: 76.1% of respondents used one or more types of CAM modalities during the MERS outbreak. Consumption of easily accessible modalities such as multivitamin (51.2%) and food products (32.1%) was most popular, and the majority of CAM users relied on mass media (52.4%) and the internet (27.4%) to obtain information on CAM. The use of CAM was associated with age between 40 and 49, age over 50, prior CAM use, and dissatisfaction with the government response to the MERS outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: CAM was commonly used by outpatients during the 2015 MERS outbreak in Korea, and mass media was the main source of information.

The increasing frequency of epidemics and pandemics such as Ebola and Covid-19, concurrent with the regional increase in terrorism, increases the potential for disease crises to be exploited as political weapons by terrorist groups, either directly or indirectly. This paper produces insights about the intersection of terrorism and disease in Africa through the exploration of terrorism’s interaction with the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), with reference to targeted violence, anti-vaccination rhetoric and anti-West suspicions in Nigeria, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Terrorism is shown to be significantly hindering polio eradication in these states, and it is argued that these actions should be incorporated into an expanded conceptualisation of bioterrorism. Lessons are drawn from the GPEI to augment current understandings of terrorism, counter-terrorism and disease in Africa, with recommendations for future action. © 2021 The Author(s).

It adapts the Poisson pseudo-maximum-likelihood (PPML) and the quantile regression techniques to effectively exploit the non-linear estimates of the data in order to derive non-biased point estimates at each quantile and make interquantile comparisons. This is particularly useful in recommending which societal variables become most significant at catastrophic levels of a pandemic like COVID-19 when existing health systems become overwhelmed. These estimators are applied to panel data for 196 countries over days of infection from the first recorded case. The COVID-19-related data is from Our World in Data, and the socio-economic variables are from the World Bank's World Development Indicators. The results establish that an improved adequate health infrastructure for both testing and treatment is necessary, but not sufficient. Health systems ultimately become overwhelmed and ineffective in managing cases and reducing mortality in the face of the rising pandemic. Complementary social, economic, physical and environmental factors are necessary for curbing deaths. These factors relate to improving the health stock of the population through reductions in both communicable and non-communicable comorbidities; enhancing sanitation and hygiene; and improving the nutrition of the population. Socio-economic and environmental measures are the reduction of household and ambient air pollution; reduction of exposure to alcohol and cigarettes; reduction of poverty and ensuring economic inclusion; and learning from the past to fine-tune governments' control measures in order to minimize harm to the population while effectively curbing mortality.","Ngepah, Nicholas",Health policy plan,572,16

The objective of this study is to analyse the influence of the latter changes in labour market status on psychological well-being. For this purpose, an ad-hoc questionnaire featuring socio-demographic and mental health criteria was created. Granted that the pandemic can be viewed as an exogenous shock, the bias caused by the bidirectional problems between the work situation and mental well-being can be tackled. Results indicate that the lockdown exerted a greater negative effect on the self-perceived well-being of unemployed and furloughed persons than on those in employment. Moreover, among those in continuous employment, teleworkers experienced a lesser degree of self-perceived well-being post lockdown as compared to those people remaining in the same work location throughout the COVID-19 crisis. Finally, the lockdown provoked worse effects on the self-perceived well-being of women as compared to men, a result that appears to be related to gender differences in household production. In conclusion, these results could be especially relevant given that the evolution of the pandemic is having ongoing effects on employment and, therefore, on the mental health of workers.","Escudero-Castillo, Israel; Mato-Díaz, Fco Javier; Rodriguez-Alvarez, Ana",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),572,16

In Mpro, there is a Cys-His catalytic dyad, and ligands that interact with the Cys145 assumed to be an effective approach to inhibit the Mpro. In this study, approximately 1400 cysteine-focused ligands were screened to identify the best candidates that can act as potent inhibitors against Mpro. Our results show that the selected ligands strongly interact with the key Cys145 and His41 residues. Covalent docking was performed for the selected candidates containing the acrylonitrile group, which can form a covalent bond with Cys145. All atoms molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was performed on the selected four inhibitors including L1, L2, L3 and L4 to validate the docking interactions. Our results were also compared with a control ligand, &#945;-ketoamide (11r). Principal component analysis on structural and energy data obtained from the MD trajectories shows that L1, L3, L4 and &#945;-ketoamide (11r) have structural similarity with the apo-form of the Mpro. Quantitative structure-activity relationship method was employed for pattern recognition of the best ligands, which discloses that ligands containing acrylonitrile and amide warheads can show better performance. ADMET analysis displays that our selected candidates appear to be safer inhibitors. Our combined studies suggest that the best cysteine focused ligands can help to design an effective lead drug for COVID-19 treatment. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

To facilitate its production, the Ministry of Public Health revised the regulation such that alcohol sanitizers can be produced by cosmetic manufacturers where all products must be formulated with Isopropanol or Ethyl Alcohol not lower than 70% V/V. This paper focuses on a cosmetics manufacturer whose 90% of revenue comes from facial skincare. With the new government regulation and the company's background on agility and flexibility in meeting market demands, the company is taking the opportunity to meet the demand for alcohol cosmetics products. Recently, it launched two standard formulations of alcohol sanitizers for private labeling. The objectives of this study are to identify the business processes and related activities in the sanitizer supply chain;to analyze problems, and to provide recommendations for improvement to be able to cope with supply chain disruption and demand spike. An in-depth interview of the owner and staff was conducted, and the sanitizer supply chain was analyzed using Integration Definition for Function Modeling (IDEF0). The results showed major problems from suppliers and brand owners. For suppliers, the lead time is very long, a 100% payment is required, and miscommunications happened. On the other hand, brand owners have very urgent orders due to unanticipated demand from the market. Solutions are suggested in this paper to address the issues on the cosmetic manufacturer's sanitizer supply chain and could serve as a guide for other cosmetics manufacturers. © 2021 IEEE.","Panitsettakorn, W.; Ongkunaruk, P.","8th IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Applications, ICIEA 2021",572,16

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly contagious disease, and its first outbreak was reported in Wuhan, China. A coronavirus disease (COVID-19) causes severe respiratory distress (ARDS). Due to the primary involvement of the respiratory system, chest CT is strongly recommended in suspected COVID-19 cases, for both initial evaluation and follow-up. Objective. The aim of this review was to systematically analyze the existing literature on CT imaging features of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods. A systematic search was conducted on PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Open Access Journals (OAJ), and Google Scholar databases until April 15, 2020. All articles with a report of CT findings in COVID-19 patients published in English from the onset of COVID-19 outbreak to April 20, 2020, were included in the study. Result. From a total of 5041 COVID-19-infected patients, about 98% (4940/5041) had abnormalities in chest CT, while about 2% have normal chest CT findings. Among COVID-19 patients with abnormal chest CT findings, 80% (3952/4940) had bilateral lung involvement. Ground-glass opacity (GGO) and mixed GGO with consolidation were observed in 2482 (65%) and 768 (18%) patients, respectively. Consolidations were detected in 1259 (22%) patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. CT images also showed interlobular septal thickening in about 691 (27%) patients. Conclusion. Frequent involvement of bilateral lung infections, ground-glass opacities, consolidation, crazy paving pattern, air bronchogram signs, and intralobular septal thickening were common CT imaging features of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.","Awulachew, Ephrem; Diriba, Kuma; Anja, Asrat; Getu, Eyob; Belayneh, Firehiwot",Radiol.

This is not the first nor will it be the last time that a member of ß-coronaviruses (CoVs) is waging a full-scale war against human health. Notwithstanding the fact that pneumonia is the primary symptom of the novel coronavirus (2019nCoV; designated as SARS-CoV-2), the emergence of severe disease mainly due to the injury of nonpulmonary organs at the shadow of coagulopathy leaves no choice, in some cases, rather than a dreadful death. Multiple casual factors such as inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, platelet and complement activation, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system derangement, and hypoxemia play a major role in the pathogenesis of coagulopathy in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Due to the undeniable role of coagulation dysfunction in the initiation of several complications, assessment of coagulation parameters and the platelet count would be beneficial in early diagnosis and also timely prediction of disease severity. Although low-molecular-weight heparin is considered as the first-line of treatment in COVID-19-associated coagulopathy, several possible therapeutic options have also been proposed for better management of the disease.

DESIGN: Qualitative interview study. SETTING: Abortion service in one National Health Service health board in Scotland. POPULATION OR SAMPLE: Twenty women who accessed telemedicine abortion services and self-administered mifepristone and misoprostol at home up to 12 weeks' gestation. METHODS: Thematic analysis of semi-structured qualitative interviews, informed by the Framework analytic approach. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Women's experiences of accessing telemedicine for medical abortion at home, specifically: acceptability of the telephone consultation and remote support; views on no pre-abortion ultrasound scan; and self-administration of abortion medications at home. RESULTS: Novel study findings were three-fold: (1) participants valued the option of accessing abortion care via telemedicine and emphasised the benefits of providing a choice of telephone and in-person consultation to suit those with different life circumstances; (2) the quality of abortion care was enhanced by the telemedicine service in relation to access, comfort and flexibility, and ongoing telephone support; (3) participants described being comfortable with, and in some cases a preference for, not having an ultrasound scan. CONCLUSIONS: This research demonstrates support for the continuation of telemedicine abortion services beyond the temporary arrangements in place during COVID-19, and lends weight to the argument that offering the option of telemedicine abortion care can enable women to access this essential health service.

A principal defence against uncontrolled inflammation, and against viral infection in general, is provided by T regulatory lymphocytes (Tregs). Treg levels have been reported to be low in many COVID-19 patients and can be increased by vitamin D supplementation. Low vitamin D levels have been associated with an increase in inflammatory cytokines and a significantly increased risk of pneumonia and viral upper respiratory tract infections. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increase in thrombotic episodes, which are frequently observed in COVID-19. Vitamin D deficiency has been found to occur more frequently in patients with obesity and diabetes. These conditions are reported to carry a higher mortality in COVID-19. If vitamin D does in fact reduce the severity of COVID-19 in regard to pneumonia/ARDS, inflammation, inflammatory cytokines and thrombosis, it is our opinion that supplements would offer a relatively easy option to decrease the impact of the pandemic.","Weir, E Kenneth; Thenappan, Thenappan; Bhargava, Maneesh; Chen, Yingjie",Clin Med (Lond),572,21

In a cohort of patients, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), beyond the classical respiratory manifestations, induces anosmia. Evidence has suggested SARS-CoV-2-induced anosmia can be the result of neurodegeneration of the olfactory pathway. Neurologic symptoms associated with COVID-19 have been reported; however, the precise mechanism and possible long-lasting effects remain poorly investigated. Preclinical models are valuable tools for describing and testing new possible treatments for neurologic disorders. In this way, the zebrafish (Danio rerio) organism model represents an attractive tool in the field of neuroscience, showing economic and logistic advantages besides genetic and physiologic similarities with mammalian, including the brain structure and functions. Besides, its external embryonic development, high availability of eggs, and fast development allows easy genetic manipulation and fast replications. In the present review, we suggest that the zebrafish model can be advantageous to investigate the neurologic features of COVID-19.","Costa, Karla C M; Brigante, Tamires A V; Fernandes, Gabriel G; Scomparin, Davi S; Scarante, Franciele F; de Oliveira, Danielle P; Campos, Alline C",ENeuro,572,16

However, little information about feasibility and effectiveness is available yet about distance teaching in anatomy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the implementation of a histology course previously taught in a classroom setting into an online-only format based on video conference software. METHODS: Our course design included theoretical introductions, an online-adaptation of virtual microscopy used previously in the classroom, and active learning elements such as collaborative learning in breakout rooms, annotation assignments and multiple-choice questions. Two preclinical semester cohorts of around 400 second and third semester students were taught in histology in parallel courses, using the Zoom software platform. We analyzed data about student attendance during the course, summative quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the students and results of a written test required to pass the course. RESULTS: We observed that student attendance was high and stable during the 19 course days for both second and third semester, and only few students reported technical problems. There were no significant differences in examination results of second semester compared to the third semester, an unexpected result as the third semester already participated in the dissection course before. Similarly, no significant gender-related effects on the examination performance could be noted in both semesters. However, the age of students was negatively correlated with test scores in the second and third semester. Importantly, the overall evaluation of the digital version of the histology course was at least as positive as the in-person version over the past years. CONCLUSION: Together, we experienced that the implementation of a curricular histology course in an online-format is technically realizable, effective and well accepted among students. We also observed that availability and prior experience with digitized specimen in virtual microscopy facilitates transition into an online-only setting. Thus, our study supports the positive potential of distance learning for teaching anatomy during and after COVID-19 pandemic but also emphasizes the need for a synchronous learning environment with partially personnel-intensive small group settings to overcome passivity and inequality aspects, and to foster active learning elements.","Darici, D; Reissner, C; Brockhaus, J; Missler, M",Ann Anat,572,20

To help understand the impact of those vector control variable strategies, a multi-week, multi-site observational study was undertaken outside of 19 New York City medical facilities during the peak of the city's initial COVID-19 wave (03/22/20-05/19/20). The aim was to capture perishable data of the touch, destination choice, and PPE usage behavior of individuals egressing hospitals and urgent care centers. A major goal was to establish an empirical basis for future research on the way people interact with three-dimensional vector environments. Anonymized data were collected via smart phones. Each data record includes the time, data, and location of an individual leaving a healthcare facility, their routing, interactions with the build environment, other individuals, and themselves. Most records also note their PPE usage, destination, intermediary stops, and transportation choices. The records were linked with 61 socio-economic factors by the facility zip code and 7 contemporaneous weather factors and the merged in a unified shapefile in an ARCGIS system.

Yet, the pandemic may have sizable long-term impacts on psychological distress and health behaviors-these effects may be long-lasting and may disproportionately affect some demographic groups more than others. Data came from a longitudinal international study of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on adults' psychological distress and wellbeing (N = 1567). We found high rates of depression (55% were diagnosable with probable depression at baseline), anxiety (65%), and risk for PTSD (51%). More than one-third of participants who reported that they drank alcohol indicated that their drinking had increased since the start of the pandemic. Over time, depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts and behaviors increased significantly, but acute stress symptoms decreased. Specific demographic groups (people of color and sexual and gender minorities) appeared to be at high risk of distress across analyses. Our findings suggest high rates of depression, anxiety, acute stress, and other signs of distress like isolation, hopelessness, and use of substances to cope-even at five-month follow-up. Our findings suggest a need to prioritize availability of, and access to, mental health care during both the pandemic and the recovery.","Veldhuis, Cindy B; Nesoff, Elizabeth D; McKowen, Anna Laura W; Rice, Dylan R; Ghoneima, Hana; Wootton, Angie R; Papautsky, Elizabeth Lerner; Arigo, Danielle; Goldberg, Shoshona; Anderson, Jocelyn C",Prev Med,572,21

While trials are underway to manipulate the diet of people with IBD, there has been no comprehensive systematic review of the dietary intake of adults with IBD. AIMS: To conduct a systematic evaluation and meta-analysis of the dietary intake of adults with IBD, including macronutrients, micronutrients and food group data. METHODS: CINAHL, Embase, Medline and Scopus were searched from 1 January 2000 to 25 September 2020 for cohort, case-control or cross-sectional studies that reported usual dietary intake in adults. Data were pooled and reported as weighted mean intake for: all adults with IBD; Crohn's disease; ulcerative colitis; active disease; remission; males; females. A random-effects meta-analysis model compared intake with healthy individuals. RESULTS: Forty studies were identified and 19 were included in the meta-analysis. All subgroups of adults with IBD consumed inadequate energy (mean intake in adults with IBD 1980 ± 130 kcal), fibre (14 ± 4 g), folate (246 ± 33 mg) and calcium (529 ± 114 mg) per day. Intake of breads and cereals, legumes, fruit, vegetables and dairy were inadequate. Compared to healthy individuals, adults with IBD consume significantly less dietary fibre (SMD -0.59; 95% CI: -0.73, -0.46).

Although health systems respond to this disease burden, healthcare itself pollutes the atmosphere, land, and waterways. We surveyed the 'state of the art' environmental sustainability research within anaesthesia and critical care, addressing why it matters, what is known, and ideas for future work. Focus is placed upon the atmospheric chemistry of the anaesthetic gases, recent work clarifying their relative global warming potentials, and progress in waste anaesthetic gas treatment. Life cycle assessment (LCA; i.e. 'cradle to grave' analysis) is introduced as the definitive method used to compare and contrast ecological footprints of products, processes, and systems. The number of LCAs within medicine has gone from rare to an established body of knowledge in the past decade that can inform doctors of the relative ecological merits of different techniques. LCAs with practical outcomes are explored, such as the carbon footprint of reusable vs single-use anaesthetic devices (e.g. drug trays, laryngoscope blades, and handles), and the carbon footprint of treating an ICU patient with septic shock.

MethodsA retrospective analysis of the records of the Information System of the Epidemiological Surveillance of Influenza of the Health Ministry of Brazil was performed. It included the data of female patients aged 10 to 49 years hospitalized because of severe COVID-19 disease (RT-PCR+ for SARS-CoV-2), from February17, 2020 to January 02, 2021.They were separated into 3 groups: pregnant, puerperal, and neither pregnant nor puerperal. General comparisons and then adjustments for confounding variables (propensity score matching [PSM]) were made, using demographic and clinical characteristics, disease progression (admission to the intensive care unit [ICU] and invasive or noninvasive ventilatory support), and outcome (cure or death). Deaths were analyzed in each group according to comorbidities, invasive or noninvasive ventilatory support, and admission to the ICU. ResultsAs many as 40,640 reproductive age women hospitalized for COVID-19 were identified: 3,372 were pregnant, 794 were puerperal, and 36,474 were neither pregnant nor puerperal. Groups were significantly different in terms of demographic data and comorbidities. Pregnant and puerperal women were less likely to be symptomatic than the women who were neither one nor the other. Pregnant women, however, had a higher frequency of cough, anosmia, and ageusia. Puerperal women had a worse prognosis than pregnant women with respect to admission to the ICU, invasive ventilatory support, and death. ConclusionPuerperal women were at a higher risk for serious outcomes (need for the ICU, need for invasive and noninvasive ventilatory support, and death) than pregnant women.","Serra, Fabiano Elisei; Francisco, Rossana Pulcineli Vieira; Rossi, Patricia de; Brizot, Maria de Lourdes; Rodrigues, Agatha Sacramento",,572,1

MethodsIndividuals of age [≥]5 years were recruited from 274 wards of the state (population [~] 19.6 million) during January 11 to January 22 2021. A total of 100 participants each were included from all the wards for a net sample size of [~]28,000. A multi-stage sampling technique was applied for selection of participants for the household serosurvey. Anti SARS CoV-2 IgG antibodies were detected by using the VITROS assay (90% Sn, 100% Sp). ResultsAntibody positivity was observed in 14,298 (50.76%) of the 28,169 samples. The age, sex and district population weighted seroprevalence of the IgG SARS-CoV-2 was 50.52% (95% C.I. 49.94-51.10) and after adjustment for assay characteristics was 56.13% (95% C.I. 55.49-56.77). On adjusted analysis, participants aged [≥]50 years, of female gender, housewives, having ever lived in containment zones, urban slum dwellers, and diabetes or hypertensive patients had significantly higher odds of SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity. The peak infection rate and the test positivity rate since October 2020 were initially observed in mid-November 2020 with a subsequent steep declining trend, followed by a period of persistently low case burden lasting until the first week of March 2021. This was followed by a steady increase followed by an exponential surge in infections from April 2021 onwards culminating in the second wave of the pandemic. ConclusionsThe presence of infection induced immunity from SARS-CoV-2 even in more than one in two people can be ineffective in protecting the population.","Sharma, Nandini; Sharma, Pragya; Basu, Saurav; Bakshi, Ritika; Gupta, Ekta; Agarwal, Reshu; Dushyant, Kumar; Mundeja, Nutan; Marak, Zeasaly; Singh, Sanjay; Singh, Gautam; Rustagi, Ruchir; Sarin, S K",,572,20

There is, however, little data available on the progression of interstitial lung disease (ILD) after severe COVID 19 infection. Here, we present the case of a patient with known ILD (chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, in this case), which progressively worsened after COVID 19 infection.Case Report:A 65 year old male presented to our clinic for management of chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis in December 2018. In 2017, he had a video assisted thoracoscopic surgery performed, when it was diagnosed that the changes in his lungs were due to chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis. On evaluation in our clinic, the patient reported dyspnea on exertion. He had mild crackles bilaterally and was saturating 94% on room air. A prior CT scan showed mild fibrosis. The patient was asked to come for a follow-up, but he was unable to do so due to the COVID 19 pandemic.In May 2020, the patient was diagnosed with severe COVID 19 pneumonia, and was admitted into the hospital, where he required supplementary oxygen. He was treated with Remdesivir and steroids, and was later discharged home on oxygen. When the patient was examined one month after discharge, he continued reporting worsening dyspnea and cough. At this time, a repeat CT scan of the chest showed worsening pulmonary fibrosis.Today, even though the patient has recovered from COVID-19, he remains dependent on supplementary oxygen.The patient has never been a smoker;he is an immigrant from Central America, having moved to the US in 2016. Back in Central America, he reported having a pet parrot in his home.Discussion:We suspect that continued exposure to the parrot may have been a cause of chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis in our patient. Further, our case report indicates that COVID 19 may cause progression of ILD even after COVID 19 itself has been cured.Since the prevalence of ILD in general (and hypersensitivity pneumonitis in specific) is low, limited research has been carried out on the correlation of this disease with COVID 19. While a recent study did indicate that adults with preexisting ILD were at an increased risk of severe COVID 19, limited data is available on the long term consequences of COVID 19 infection for ILD patients.","Aftab, G.; Ahmad, M.; Hamid, K.

To determine if SARS-CoV-2 RNA was present in sewage during the emergence of COVID-19 in The Netherlands, sewage samples of six cities and the airport were tested using four qRT-PCR assays, three targeting the nucleocapsid gene (N1-N3) and one the envelope gene (E). No SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected on February 6, 3 weeks before the first Dutch case was reported. On March 4/5, one or more gene fragments were detected in sewage of three sites, in concentrations of 2.6-30 gene copies per mL. In Amersfoort, N3 was detected in sewage 6 days before the first cases were reported. As the prevalence of COVID-19 in these cities increased in March, the RNA signal detected by each qRT-PCR assay increased, for N1-N3 up to 790-2200 gene copies per mL. This increase correlated significantly with the increase in reported COVID-19 prevalence. The detection of the virus RNA in sewage, even when the COVID-19 prevalence is low, and the correlation between concentration in sewage and reported prevalence of COVID-19, indicate that sewage surveillance could be a sensitive tool to monitor the circulation of the virus in the population.","Medema, Gertjan; Heijnen, Leo; Elsinga, Goffe; Italiaander, Ronald; Brouwer, Anke",Environ.

During the first weeks of the Spanish COVID-19 lockdown, an experimental study was carried out in which 69 Spanish translation students were instructed to translate two English STs with different evaluative attitudes (i.e. optimistic vs. pessimistic) toward the COVID-19 crisis. The study explored whether the different optimistic vs pessimistic framing of the crisis would influence the students' use of translation strategies (h1), their levels of anxiety (h2) and their levels of affect (h3) after both reading and translating the STs. Results revealed statistically significant differences between the two translation strategies analyzed (i.e. emphasis and attenuation), with more emphasizing strategies than attenuating ones, regardless of the group. Moreover, a significant effect of the interaction between text and group was also reported, which indicated an overall stronger inclination to alter -either mitigating or emphasizing- evaluative language in the pessimistic text. A significant increase in participants' levels of anxiety and negative affect was also found after the pessimistic framing as compared to the optimistic one. Data also pointed to differences between reading and translating in terms of the participant's anxiety levels, with statistically significant higher anxiety scores after reading than translating.

However, the effect of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) on the efficacy to mount an appropriate immune response is unknown. We aimed to characterize humoral immunity in mRNA-COVID-19 MS vaccinees treated with high-efficacy DMTs. Methods: We measured SARS-CoV-2 IgG response using anti-spike protein-based serology (EUROIMMUN) in 125 MS patients vaccinated with BNT162b2-COVID-19 vaccine 1 month after the second dose. Patients were either untreated or under treatment with fingolimod, cladribine, or ocrelizumab. A group of healthy subjects similarly vaccinated served as control. The percent of subjects that developed protective antibodies, the titer, and the time from the last dosing were evaluated. Results: Protective humoral immunity of 97.9%, 100%, 100%, 22.7%, and 3.8%, was observed in COVID-19 vaccinated healthy subjects (N = 47), untreated MS patients (N = 32), and MS patients treated with cladribine (N = 23), ocrelizumab (N = 44), and fingolimod (N = 26), respectively. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody titer was high in healthy subjects, untreated MS patients, and MS patients under cladribine treatment, within 29.5–55 days after the second vaccine dose. Only 22.7% of patients treated with ocrelizumab developed humoral IgG response irrespective to normal absolute lymphocyte count. Most fingolimod-treated MS patients had very low lymphocyte count and failed to develop SARS-COV-2 antibodies. Age, disease duration, and time from the last dosing did not affect humoral response to COVID-19 vaccination. Conclusions: Cladribine treatment does not impair humoral response to COVID-19 vaccination. We recommend postponing ocrelizumab treatment in MS patients willing to be vaccinated as a protective humoral response can be expected only in some. We do not recommend vaccinating MS patients treated with fingolimod as a protective humoral response is not expected.","Achiron, A.; Mandel, M.; Dreyer-Alster, S.; Harari, G.; Magalashvili, D.; Sonis, P.; Dolev, M.; Menascu, S.; Flechter, S.; Falb, R.; Gurevich, M.",Therapeutic Advances in Neurological Disorders,572,13

Particularly with regard to the interdependence of critical infrastructures means that water supply failures can have far-reaching consequences and endanger the safety of a society, e.g., by impairing hospital operations. In case of an emergency in the drinking water infrastructure, minimum supply standards, e.g., for patients in hospitals, become important for emergency management during crisis situations. However, wider recognition of this issue is still lacking, particularly in countries facing comparably minor water supply disruptions. Several international agencies provide guideline values for minimum water supply standards for hospitals in case of a disaster. Acknowledging these minimum standards were developed for humanitarian assistance or civil protection, it remains to be analyzed whether these standards apply to disaster management in countries with high water and healthcare supply standards. Based on a literature review of scientific publications and humanitarian guidelines, as well as policies from selected countries, current processes, contents, and shortcomings of emergency water supply planning are assessed.

We investigated how a 40S subunit was recruited by the cricket paralysis virus intergenic region (CrPV IGR) IRES to form a stable 40S-IRES complex. Kinetic binding studies revealed that formation of the complex between the CrPV IGR and the 40S subunit consisted of two-steps: an initial fast binding step of the IRES to the 40S ribosomal subunit, followed by a slow unimolecular reaction consistent with a conformational change that stabilized the complex. We further showed that the ribosomal protein S25 (eS25), which is required by functionally and structurally diverse IRESs, impacts both steps of the complex formation. Mutations in eS25 that reduced CrPV IGR IRES activity either decreased 40S-IRES complex formation, or increased the rate of the conformational change that was required to form a stable 40S-IRES complex. Our data are consistent with a model in which eS25 facilitates initial binding of the CrPV IGR IRES to the 40S while ensuring that the conformational change stabilizing the 40S-IRES complex does not occur prematurely.","Walters, Beth; Axhemi, Armend; Jankowsky, Eckhard; Thompson, Sunnie R",Nucleic acids res,572,1

As indicated in the recent article posted on the US FDA website, the group testing approach for COVID-19 has received a lot of interest lately. There are two key elements in a group testing technique: (i) the pooling matrix that directs samples to be pooled into groups, and (ii) the decoding algorithm that uses the group test results to reconstruct the status of each sample. In this paper, we propose a new family of pooling matrices from packing the pencil of lines (PPoL) in a finite projective plane. We compare their performance with various pooling matrices proposed in the literature, including 2D-pooling, P-BEST, and Tapestry, using the two-stage definite defectives (DD) decoding algorithm. By conducting extensive simulations for a range of prevalence rates up to 5%, our numerical results show that there is no pooling matrix with the lowest relative cost in the whole range of the prevalence rates. To optimize the performance, one should choose the right pooling matrix, depending on the prevalence rate. The family of PPoL matrices can dynamically adjust their column weights according to the prevalence rates and could be a better alternative than using a fixed pooling matrix.","Lin, Yi-Jheng; Yu, Che-Hao; Liu, Tzu-Hsuan; Chang, Cheng-Shang; Chen, Wen-Tsuen",,572,20

Although telemedicine is not a novel technology, previous studies have offered mixed opinions surrounding its utilization. However, there exists a dearth of research on how these opinions have evolved over the course of the current pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate how the language and sentiment surrounding telemedicine has evolved throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Tweets published between January 1, 2020, and April 24, 2021, containing at least one telemedicine-related and one COVID-19-related search term (""telemedicine-COVID"") were collected from the Twitter full archive search (N=351,718). A comparator sample containing only COVID-19 terms (""general-COVID"") was collected and sampled based on the daily distribution of telemedicine-COVID tweets. In addition to analyses of retweets and favorites, sentiment analysis was performed on both data sets in aggregate and within a subset of tweets receiving the top 100 most and least retweets. RESULTS: Telemedicine gained prominence during the early stages of the pandemic (ie, March through May 2020) before leveling off and reaching a steady state from June 2020 onward. Telemedicine-COVID tweets had a 21% lower average number of retweets than general-COVID tweets (incidence rate ratio 0.79, 95% CI 0.63-0.99; P=.04), but there was no difference in favorites. A majority of telemedicine-COVID tweets (180,295/351,718, 51.3%) were characterized as ""positive,"" compared to only 38.5% (135,434/351,401) of general-COVID tweets (P<.001). This trend was also true on a monthly level from March 2020 through April 2021. The most retweeted posts in both telemedicine-COVID and general-COVID data sets were authored by journalists and politicians. Whereas the majority of the most retweeted posts within the telemedicine-COVID data set were positive (55/101, 54.5%), a plurality of the most retweeted posts within the general-COVID data set were negative (44/89, 49.4%; P=.01). CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, opinions surrounding telemedicine evolved to become more positive, especially when compared to the larger pool of COVID-19-related tweets. Decision makers should capitalize on these shifting public opinions to invest in telemedicine infrastructure and ensure its accessibility and success in a postpandemic world.","Pollack, Catherine C; Gilbert-Diamond, Diane; Alford-Teaster, Jennifer A; Onega, Tracy",J Med Internet Res,572,16

A growing consensus suggests that multi-plate tectonics was preceded by cooling through a single-plate lithosphere, but models for how this lithosphere was first broken into plates have not converged on a mechanism or a typical early plate scale. A commonality among prior efforts is the use of continuum mechanics approximations to evaluate this solid mechanics problem. Here we use 3D spherical shell models to demonstrate a self-organized fracture mechanism analogous to thermal expansion-driven lithospheric uplift, in which globe-spanning rifting occurs as a consequence of horizontal extension. Resultant fracture spacing is a function of lithospheric thickness and rheology, wherein geometrically-regular, polygonal-shaped tessellation is an energetically favored solution because it minimizes total crack length. Therefore, warming of the early lithosphere itself-as anticipated by previous studies-should lead to failure, propagating fractures, and the conditions necessary for the onset of multi-plate tectonics.","Tang, C A; Webb, A A G; Moore, W B; Wang, Y Y; Ma, T H; Chen, T T",Nat Commun,572,24

The decision whether or not to get vaccinated has so far been left to the individual citizens. However, there are good reasons, both in theory as well as in practice, to believe that the willingness to get vaccinated might not be sufficiently high to achieve herd immunity. A policy of mandatory vaccination could ensure high levels of vaccination coverage, but its legitimacy is doubtful. We investigate the willingness to get vaccinated and the reasons for an acceptance (or rejection) of a policy of mandatory vaccination against COVID-19 in June and July 2020 in Germany based on a representative real time survey, a random sub-sample (SOEP-CoV) of the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP). Our results show that about 70 percent of adults in Germany would voluntarily get vaccinated against the coronavirus if a vaccine without side effects was available. About half of residents of Germany are in favor, and half against, a policy of mandatory vaccination. The approval rate for mandatory vaccination is significantly higher among those who would get vaccinated voluntarily (around 60 percent) than among those who would not get vaccinated voluntarily (27 percent). The individual willingness to get vaccinated and acceptance of a policy of mandatory vaccination correlates systematically with socio-demographic and psychological characteristics of the respondents. We conclude that as far as people's declared intentions are concerned, herd immunity could be reached without a policy of mandatory vaccination, but that such a policy might be found acceptable too, were it to become necessary.","Graeber, Daniel; Schmidt-Petri, Christoph; Schröder, Carsten",PLoS One,572,21

We identified risk factors, comorbidities, and outcomes in patients with COVID-19 with or without acute ischemic stroke and compared with patients without COVID-19 and acute ischemic stroke. METHODS: We analyzed the data from 54 health care facilities using the Cerner deidentified COVID-19 dataset. The dataset included patients with an emergency department or inpatient encounter with discharge diagnoses codes that could be associated to suspicion of or exposure to COVID-19 or confirmed COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 103 (1.3%) patients developed acute ischemic stroke among 8163 patients with COVID-19. Among all patients with COVID-19, the proportion of patients with hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and congestive heart failure was significantly higher among those with acute ischemic stroke. Acute ischemic stroke was associated with discharge to destination other than home or death (relative risk, 2.1 [95% CI, 1.6-2.4]; P<0.0001) after adjusting for potential confounders. A total of 199 (1.0%) patients developed acute ischemic stroke among 19 513 patients without COVID-19. Among all ischemic stroke patients, COVID-19 was associated with discharge to destination other than home or death (relative risk, 1.2 [95% CI, 1.0-1.3]; P=0.03) after adjusting for potential confounders. CONCLUSIONS: Acute ischemic stroke was infrequent in patients with COVID-19 and usually occurs in the presence of other cardiovascular risk factors. The risk of discharge to destination other than home or death increased 2-fold with occurrence of acute ischemic stroke in patients with COVID-19.","Qureshi, Adnan I; Baskett, William I; Huang, Wei; Shyu, Daniel; Myers, Danny; Raju, Murugesan; Lobanova, Iryna; Suri, M Fareed K; Naqvi, S Hasan; French, Brandi R; Siddiq, Farhan; Gomez, Camilo R; Shyu, Chi-Ren",Stroke,572,26

We randomly assigned 8376 lower-middle income youth in urban India to three treatments: a concentrated and targeted fact-based, instructional intervention; a longer instructional intervention that provided the same facts along with underlying scientific concepts; and a control. Relative to existing efforts, we find that both instructional interventions increased COVID-19-related knowledge immediately after intervention. Relative to the shorter fact-based intervention, the longer intervention resulted in sustained improvements in knowledge, attitudes, and self-reported behavior. Instead of reducing attention and comprehension by youth, the longer scientific based treatment appears to have increased understanding and retention of the material. The findings are instrumental to understanding the design of instruction and communication in affecting compliance during this and future pandemics.","Mistree, Dinsha; Loyalka, Prashant; Fairlie, Robert; Bhuradia, Ashutosh; Angrish, Manyu; Lin, Jason; Karoshi, Amar; Yen, Sara J; Mistri, Jamsheed; Bayat, Vafa",Soc Sci Med,572,28

Methods: Adverse events were prospectively evaluated using an electronic diary in 135 healthy adults who received a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (AZD1222, AstraZeneca/Oxford, n = 42; or BNT162b2, Pfizer/BioNTech, n = 93). We semi-quantitatively measured anti-S1 immunoglobulin G (IgG) using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at baseline, 3 weeks after the first dose of AZD1222 or BNT162b2, and 2 weeks after the second dose of BNT162b2. We evaluated the association between the maximum grade of local or systemic adverse events and the anti-S1 IgG optical density using multivariate linear regression with adjustment for age, sex, and use of antipyretics. Results: The median age of the 135 vaccinees was 30 years (36 years in the AZD1222 group and 29 years in the BNT162b2 group) and 25.9% were male (9.5% in the AZD1222 group and 33.3% in the BNT162b2 group). Local and systemic adverse events were generally comparable after the first dose of AZD1222 and the second dose of BNT162b2. The grades of local and systemic adverse events were not significantly associated with anti-S1 IgG levels in the AZD1222 or BNT162b2 group. Conclusions: Local and systemic reactogenicity may not be associated with humoral immunogenicity after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.","Hwang, Young Hoon; Song, Kyoung-Ho; Choi, Yunsang; Go, Suryeong; Choi, Su-Jin; Jung, Jongtak; Kang, Chang Kyung; Choe, Pyoeng Gyun; Kim, Nam-Joong; Park, Wan Beom; Oh, Myoung-Don",Korean j. intern. med.,572,20

Low- and medium-income countries are more affected economically and socially compared to developed countries due to the lack of a rapid, robust, and affordable testing infrastructure. Furthermore, the high cost of real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system, sophisticated user-handling procedure, and high expense of the conventional clinical tests are the root causes of the less accessibility of the testing systems to the users. In this study, a COVID-19 Point-of-Care (POC) ecosystem model is proposed for the low- and medium-income countries (or energy deprived countries) that will facilitate the technological development with locally available fabrication components. In addition, the nontechnological development phases have also been discussed, which encompasses the collaboration among academia, local as well as government bodies, and entrepreneurial ventures. In addition, a hypothetical design of a microfluidic paper-based analytical (?PADs) POC platform is proposed to detect COVID-19 analyte using unprocessed patient-derived saliva, which is a miniaturized form-factor of conventional real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. The device contains four major reaction zones, which are sample zone, buffer zone, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) Master Mix zone, Ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) zone, and sensor zone. To obtain quicker test results and easier operation, a handheld image acquisition technique is introduced in this study. It is hypothesized that in a remote setting, the proposed design could be used as an initial guideline to develop a POC COVID-19 testing system, which may be simple, easy-to-use, and cost-effective.","Chowdury, Mosfera A.; Khalid, Farrukh",International Journal of Energy Research,572,20

DESIGN AND METHODS: This study was conducted in a descriptive design. The keywords ""COVID-19, explain, children"" were searched on the YouTube platform on March 17, 2021, and 294 videos were reviewed. The content of the selected videos was analyzed by 2 independent reviewers. Meet the inclusion criteria, 57 videos were evaluated according to the presenter source and the presented audience with the COVID-19 for Children Checklist (CCC), DISCERN score and the Global Quality Score (GQS). RESULTS: When the contents of 57 videos included in the study were reviewed, it was determined that 56.1% (n = 32) were informative and 43.9% (n = 25) were misleading. Kappa value among the two independent observers was 0.89. 17.5% (n = 10) of the videos scored 5 points from DISCERN and 31.6% (n = 18) scored 4 points from GQS. The mean scores of GQS, DISCERN and CCC of videos with the grouped as informative were found to be statistically higher. There was a significant difference between the DISCERN mean score of ministry/academic/hospital/physician channel videos was higher than the mean score of entertainment/individual channel videos. CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that videos explaining COVID-19 to children have high viewing rates, but also videos that are low in terms of quality and reliability. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: It is thought that this study will reduce the rates of hospitalization by protecting children from COVID-19 by providing them access to healthier and more reliable sources.","Azak, Merve; Sahin, Kadriye; Korkmaz, Nihan; Yildiz, Suzan",J. pediatr. nurs,572,21

Despite decades of research, an effective drug therapy for acute respiratory distress syndrome remains elusive. The ideal pharmacotherapy for acute respiratory distress syndrome should demonstrate antiprotease activity and target injurious inflammatory pathways while maintaining host defense against infection. Furthermore, a drug with a reputable safety profile, low possibility of off-target effects, and well-known pharmacokinetics would be desirable. The endogenous 52-kd serine protease &#945;1-antitrypsin has the potential to be a novel treatment option for acute respiratory distress syndrome. The main function of &#945;1-antitrypsin is as an antiprotease, targeting neutrophil elastase in particular. However, studies have also highlighted the role of &#945;1-antitrypsin in the modulation of inflammation and bacterial clearance. In light of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the identification of a treatment for acute respiratory distress syndrome is even more pertinent, and &#945;1-antitrypsin has been implicated in the inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Hogan, Grace; Geoghegan, Pierce; Carroll, Tomás P; Clarke, Jennifer; McElvaney, Oisín F; McElvaney, Oliver J; McElvaney, Noel G; Curley, Gerard F",Anesthesiology,572,20

DESIGN: We conducted a naturalistic observational study in the period from April to June 2020. SAMPLE: In two western Austrian provinces, a total of 2080 persons were observed in front of 24 grocery stores. MEASUREMENT: The frequencies and types of erroneous behavior in the use of face masks were collected using a standardized observation form. RESULTS: A total of 2080 persons were observed. Almost one-third of all observations (n = 648; 31.2%) showed erroneous behavior before positioning the face masks. Another 935 (45.0%) persons touched the face mask front during the adjustment via mouth and nose, 501 (24.1%) persons touched the face mask front in the period after the adjustment. A total of 116 (5.6%) persons showed erroneous behavior in each sequence of the observation unit. Overall, almost half of all people observed showed at least one erroneous behavior within the observation period. CONCLUSIONS: The behavior of the general public in handling face masks is highly error-prone. Decision makers must increasingly provide accompanying information and educational measures in order to encourage the population at risk to use face masks correctly.","Kellerer, Jan D; Rohringer, Matthias; Deufert, Daniela",Public health nurs,572,26

However, studies relating to the ecological impacts of DBPs on the aquatic environment remain insufficient. In this study, we comparatively investigated the toxicities and ecological risks of 17 typical, halogenated DBPs to three trophic levels of organisms in the freshwater ecosystem, including phytoplankton (Scenedesmus sp.), zooplankton (Daphnia magna), and fish (Danio rerio). Toxicity of DBPs was found to be species-specific: Scenedesmus sp. was the most sensitive to haloacetic acids, while D. magna was the most sensitive to haloacetonitriles and trihalomethanes. Specific to each DBP, toxicities were also related to their classes and substituted halogen atoms. Damage to photosystems and oxidative stress served as the potential mechanisms for DBPs toxicity to microalgae. The different sensitivities to DBPs indicate that a battery of bioassays with organisms at different trophic levels is necessary to determine the ecotoxicity of DBPs. Furthermore, the ecological risks of DBPs were assessed by calculating the risk quotients (RQs) based on toxicity data from multiple bioassays. The cumulative RQs of DBPs to all the organisms were greater than 1.0, indicating high ecological risks of DBPs in wastewater effluents.","Cui, Huijun; Chen, Baiyang; Jiang, Yuelu; Tao, Yi; Zhu, Xiaoshan; Cai, Zhonghua",Environ Sci Technol,572,1

While in their work the background component is a completely known distribution, we extend their approach here to three emblematic settings: when the background distribution is symmetric; when it is monotonic; and when it is log-concave. In each setting, we derive estimators for the background component, establish consistency, and provide a confidence band. While the estimation of a background component is straightforward when it is taken to be symmetric or monotonic, when it is log-concave its estimation requires the computation of a largest concave minorant, which we implement using sequential quadratic programming. Compared to existing methods, our method has the advantage of requiring much less prior knowledge on the background component, and is thus less prone to model misspecification. We illustrate this methodology on a number of synthetic and real datasets.","Arias-Castro, Ery; Jiang, He",,572,16

In contrast, the COVID-19 pandemic has been harder to contain, partly because of its wide spectrum of symptoms in infectious hosts. Current evidence suggests that individuals can transmit the novel coronavirus while displaying few symptoms. Here, we show that the proportion of infections arising from hosts with few symptoms at the start of an outbreak can, in combination with the basic reproduction number, indicate whether or not interventions targeting symptomatic hosts are likely to be effective. However, as an outbreak continues, the proportion of infections arising from hosts with few symptoms changes in response to control measures. A high proportion of infections from hosts with few symptoms after the initial stages of an outbreak is only problematic if the rate of new infections remains high. Otherwise, it can simply indicate that symptomatic transmissions are being prevented successfully. This should be considered when interpreting estimates of the extent of transmission from hosts with few COVID-19 symptoms.","Thompson, Robin N.; Lovell-Read, Francesca A.; Obolski, Uri",J. Clin.

Neutrophils may contribute to this through a process referred to as immunothrombosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of neutrophil subpopulations in blood preceding the development of COVID-19 associated PE. METHODS: We studied COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU of our tertiary hospital between 19-03-2020 and 17-05-2020. Point-of-care fully automated flow cytometry was performed prior to ICU admission, measuring the neutrophil activation/maturation markers CD10, CD11b, CD16 and CD62L. Neutrophil receptor expression was compared between patients who did or did not develop PE (as diagnosed on CT angiography) during or after their ICU stay. RESULTS: Among 25 eligible ICU patients, 22 subjects were included for analysis, of whom nine developed PE. The median (IQR) time between neutrophil phenotyping and PE occurrence was 9 (7-12) days. A significant increase in the immune-suppressive neutrophil phenotype CD16bright /CD62Ldim was observed on the day of ICU admission (P = 0.014) in patients developing PE compared to patients who did not. CONCLUSION: The increase in this neutrophil phenotype indicates that the increased number of CD16bright /CD62Ldim neutrophils might be used as prognostic marker to predict those patients that will develop PE in critical COVID-19 patients.","Spijkerman, Roy; Jorritsma, Nikita K N; Bongers, Suzanne H; Bindels, Bas J J; Jukema, Bernard N; Hesselink, Lillian; Hietbrink, Falco; Leenen, Luke P H; van Goor, Harriët M R; Vrisekoop, Nienke; Kaasjager, Karin A H; Koenderman, Leo",Scand J Immunol,572,20

Thus, the aim of this study is to evaluate possible findings on chest CT of patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory syndromes and positive epidemiological factors for COVID-19 infection and to correlate them with the course of the disease. In this sense, it is also expected to develop specific machine learning algorithm for this purpose, through pulmonary segmentation, which can predict possible prognostic factors, through more accurate results. Our alternative hypothesis is that the machine learning model based on clinical, radiological and epidemiological data will be able to predict the severity prognosis of patients infected with COVID-19. We will perform a multicenter retrospective longitudinal study to obtain a large number of cases in a short period of time, for better study validation.

It is essential to have a highly sensitive diagnostic screening tool to detect the disease as early as possible. Currently, chest CT imaging is preferred as the primary screening tool for evaluating the COVID-19 pneumonia by radiological imaging. However, CT imaging requires larger radiation doses, longer exposure time, higher cost, and may suffer from patient movements. X-Ray imaging is a fast, cheap, more patient-friendly and available in almost every healthcare facility. Therefore, we have focused on X-Ray images and developed an end-to-end deep learning model, i.e. Ensemble-CVDNet, to distinguish COVID-19 pneumonia from non-COVID pneumonia and healthy cases in this work. The proposed model is based on a combination of three lightweight pre-trained models SqueezeNet, ShuffleNet, and EfficientNet-B0 at different depths, and combines feature maps in different abstraction levels. In the proposed end to-end model, networks are used as feature extractors in parallel after fine-tuning, and some additional layers are used at the top of them. The proposed model is evaluated in the COVID-19 Radiography Database, a public data set consisting of 219 COVID-19, 1341 Healthy, and 1345 Viral Pneumonia chest X-Ray images. Experimental results show that our lightweight Ensemble-CVDNet model provides 98.30% accuracy, 97.78% sensitivity, and 97.61% F1 score using only 5.62M parameters. Moreover, it takes about 10ms to process and predict an X-Ray image using the proposed method using a mid level GPU. We believe that the method proposed in this study can be a helpful diagnostic screening tool for radiologists in the early diagnosis of the disease.","Oksuz, Cocsku; Urhan, Ouguzhan; Gullu, Mehmet Kemal",,572,20

However, sensitive sample preparation and detection methods are necessary to detect trace levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in influent wastewater (IWW). Unlike predecessors, method optimization of a SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration and detection procedure was performed with IWW samples with high viral SARS-CoV-2 RNA loads. This is of importance since the SARS-CoV-2 genome in IWW might have already been subject to in-sewer degradation into smaller genome fragments or might be present in a different form (e.g. cell debris, ). Centricon Plus-70 (100 kDa) centrifugal filter devices resulted in the lowest and most reproducible Ct-values for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Lowering the molecular weight cut-off did not improve our limit of detection and quantification (approximately 100 copies/µL for all genes). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was employed for the amplification of the N1, N2, N3 and E-gene fragments. This is one of the first studies to apply digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in IWW. dPCR showed high variability at low concentration levels (100 copies/µL), indicating that variability in bioanalytical methods for wastewater-based epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 might be substantial. dPCR results in IWW were in line with the results found with qPCR. On average, the N2-gene fragment showed high in-sample stability in IWW for 10 days of storage at 4 °C. Between-sample variability was substantial due to the low native concentrations in IWW. Additionally, the E-gene fragment proved to be less stable compared to the N2-gene fragment and showed higher variability. Freezing the IWW samples resulted in a 10-fold decay of loads of the N2- and E-gene fragment in IWW.","Boogaerts, Tim; Jacobs, Lotte; De Roeck, Naomi; Van den Bogaert, Siel; Aertgeerts, Bert; Lahousse, Lies; van Nuijs, Alexander L N; Delputte, Peter",Sci Total Environ,572,16

Combined genomics and transcription factor profiling reveal that MAST1, a critical platinum resistance factor that reprograms the MAPK pathway, is upregulated upon cisplatin exposure through activated transcription factor GR. Mechanistically, cisplatin binds to C622 in GR and recruits GR to the nucleus for its activation, which induces MAST1 expression and consequently reactivates MEK signaling. GR nuclear translocation and MAST1 upregulation coordinately occur in patient tumors collected after platinum treatment, and align with patient treatment resistance. Co-treatment with dexamethasone and cisplatin restores cisplatin-resistant tumor growth, whereas addition of the MAST1 inhibitor lestaurtinib abrogates tumor growth while preserving the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone on inflammation in vivo. These findings not only provide insights into the underlying mechanism of GR in cisplatin resistance but also offer an effective alternative therapeutic strategy to improve the clinical outcome of patients receiving platinum-based chemotherapy with GR agonists.","Pan, Chaoyun; Kang, JiHoon; Hwang, Jung Seok; Li, Jie; Boese, Austin C; Wang, Xu; Yang, Likun; Boggon, Titus J; Chen, Georgia Z; Saba, Nabil F; Shin, Dong M; Magliocca, Kelly R; Jin, Lingtao; Kang, Sumin",Nat Commun,572,16

Females are in greater risk for psychological problems than males. The present study investigated gender differences of depression and anxiety and explored associated factors during the COVID-19 epidemic among Chinese social media users. METHODS: We recruited 3088 participants through social media cross China. Participants completed sociodemographic and the COVID-19 epidemic related questions, the 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2), and the 2-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-2), the Chinese version of the 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. We applied Chi-square test and ANOVA for data description and linear regression analysis for exploring factors associated with depression and anxiety. RESULTS: Of 3063 participants eligible for analysis, the total prevalence of depression and anxiety was 14.14 and 13.25%. Females were experiencing more severe stress and anxiety symptoms, while males showed better resilience to stress. The severity of depression symptoms would decrease with the increase of age resilience, and it would increase if being unemployed, feeling less adapted, being more stressed. The severity of anxiety symptoms would decrease with higher education and better resilience, and it would increase if being female, spending over 60 min on COVID-19 related information, less adapted, and being more stressed. CONCLUSION: The findings show the increased prevalence of depression and anxiety in Chinese population during the COVID-19 epidemic, and females are experiencing more severe anxiety symptoms than males. As social media is the current main resource of information related to COVID-19, interventions should be implemented to help users to limit the time they spend on social media and to get key information related to the epidemic from authoritative and authentic resource to avoid infodemic and prevent mental health problems.","Hou, Fengsu; Bi, Fengying; Jiao, Rong; Luo, Dan; Song, Kangxing",BMC Public Health,572,1

Their apparent brittleness under uniaxial loading, however, is still a major obstacle to their industrialization. Moreover, BMGs often contain crystalline defects developed, intentionally or not, during their complex and delicate elaboration. These flaws are known to affect their fracture toughness and their plastic behaviour. This paper reviews twenty years of works about this subject on Zr-based bulk metallic glasses that may contain a low volume fraction of crystalline defects of different natures, e.g. dendrites or spherulites, depending on the synthesis method. Dedicated experimental set-ups, mainly bending tests on notched beams, were developed to create in the specimen a proper pre-crack by fatigue and then load it monotonically up to fracture. The measured fracture toughness and the fractographic observations allow to conclude that these crystalline defects facilitate pre-cracking, but result in an embrittlement that is more or less significant depending on their type. The loading mode of the crack -- mode I, II or mixed -- as well as the temperature were shown to play a key role in crack initiation and propagation, whether steadily or catastrophically, in the BMG. By means of finite element computations analyses, explanations on how the crystalline flaws presence can affect fracture toughness and perturbate crack growth, under mode I and mode II, were proposed.Finally, the relevance of these experimental techniques as well as the link between crystalline defects, fracture toughness and their consequences on the ductility of a structural component are discussed.","Bernard, Cédric; Keryvin, Vincent",J. phys. condens. matter,572,14

All studies with original data, involving detection of SARS-CoV-2 in semen of male patients with COVID-19 or in those who have recovered from it, were included in the study. Six articles, including 136 samples, entered the systematic review. Most of the studies were performed in the recovery phase of COVID-19. In four articles, SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in semen, while in the other two articles semen testing showed the presence of the virus in some samples. Testicular discomfort, testicular cell damage, and spermogram disruption were also reported in some studies. We conclude that the study question cannot be answered with this number of studies. Since most of the samples were mild to moderate forms of COVID-19, it is not yet clear what the presence of the virus in semen will be in severe cases. The long-term effects are also vague.

METHODS: We performed a prospective, multicenter, observational study of adults admitted with ILI during three influenza seasons (2012-2015). Patients were screened for picornavirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, bocavirus, parainfluenza virus, and influenza, by PCR on nasopharyngeal samples. We excluded patients coinfected with NIRV and influenza. RESULTS: Among 1421 patients enrolled, influenza virus was detected in 535 (38%), and NIRV in 215 (15%), mostly picornavirus (n = 61), RSV (n = 53), coronavirus 229E (n = 48), and human metapneumovirus (n = 40). In-hospital mortality was 5% (NIRV), 4% (influenza), and 5% (no respiratory virus). As compared to influenza, NIRV were associated with age (median, 73 years vs. 68, P = 0.026), chronic respiratory diseases (53% vs. 45%, P = 0.034), cancer (14% vs. 9%, P = 0.029), and immunosuppressive drugs (21% vs. 14%, P = 0.028), and inversely associated with diabetes (18% vs. 25%, P = 0.038). On multivariable analysis, only chronic respiratory diseases (OR 1.5 [1.1-2.0], P = 0.008), and diabetes (OR 0.5 [0.4-0.8], P = 0.01) were associated with NIRV detection.

Internet-based treatment for problematic alcohol use, specifically, has been found to show results on par with other forms of treatment. However, in-depth knowledge of users' experiences is required to understand what works, and what needs further development. The aim of this study is to investigate the help-seeking motives among users of an internet-based service for problematic alcohol use, as well as the users' experiences of the support available through the service. METHOD: The study consists of a thematic analysis of interviews with 38 former users of the internet-based intervention Alkoholhjälpen. RESULTS: The analysis shows that health and relationship factors, as well as feelings of shame, were important motives for the users' decisions to reduce their drinking. Availability and anonymity seem to have been important reasons for choosing internet-based support. The different treatment components, i.e. ICBT program, therapist support and discussion forum, were each perceived as helpful by some users but not by others. Treatment components were described as more useful when users were able to personally identify with the content, and when it helped them reflect on their own alcohol consumption. CONCLUSIONS: There are several aspects that are relevant, beyond the comparison between components, if we want to understand what works and for whom in internet-based treatment. Internet-based treatment services should be generous in terms of options for the users.","Ekström, Veronica; Johansson, Magnus",Addict Sci Clin Pract,572,24

We discuss potential mechanisms of pathogenesis, including a discussion of how the understanding of neurological complications known to occur in HIV-1 patients may provide insight into SARS-CoV-2-associated neurological manifestations. Specifically, three hypotheses are discussed that are informed by decades of knowledge about HIV pathogenesis in the brain, which include a potential direct viral effect, an indirect viral effect, and/or a neuroimmune axis effect.

Understanding the role of anosmia as an early symptom of infection may improve monitoring and management of SARS-CoV2 infection. METHODOLOGY: We conducted a systematic review of the literature of SARS-CoV2 infection/COVID-19 and anosmia to help inform management of anosmia in healthcare works. We report a case series of healthcare workers, who presented with a loss of sense of smell secondary to COVID-19 infection to demonstrate management principles. RT-PCR was used to confirm COVID-19 positivity and psychophysical testing of olfaction was performed using the British version of the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test, UPSIT. RESULTS: The systematic literature search returned 31 articles eligible for inclusion in the study and informed our recommendations for clinical assessment and management. All three healthcare professionals who presented with loss of sense of smell subsequently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Psychophysical testing of olfaction using the UPSIT confirmed mild and moderate microsmia in two, respectively, and normosmia at day 17 in one. CONCLUSIONS: Olfactory (Â± gustatory) dysfunction is indicative of COVID-19 infection and thus has important implications in the context of healthcare workers, or key workers in general, who work in close contact with others if not recognised as suffering from COVID. This leads to a potentially higher likelihood of spreading the virus. In conjunction with our literature review these findings have helped with creating recommendations on the assessment and management of olfactory dysfunction during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, both for healthcare workers and patients.","Lechner, M; Chandrasekharan, D; Jumani, K; Liu, J; Gane, S; Lund, V J; Philpott, C; Jayaraj, S",Rhinology,572,33

The existing literature on the impact of COVID-19 in the education sector is predominantly descriptive and focused on the difficulties faced by teachers during the process of transferring into online teaching, mainly in the higher education sector. This study adopted a mixed-method design to examine online teaching self-efficacy (TSE) during COVID-19, its associated factors and moderators. A sample of 351 Chinese school teachers retrospectively reported their online TSE at the beginning and end of COVID-19 school lockdown, out of which six were followed up for an in-depth interview. TSE for online instruction did not significantly increase (ß = .014, p > 0.05) whereas that for technology application increased significantly (ß = .231, p < 0.01). Lack of experience in online teaching, separation of teachers from students, school administrative process and unsatisfactory student academic performance were identified as the major associated factors. A moderation effect of adaptability and teacher burnout on the change in online TSE were examined, of which passion burnout was the only significant moderator toward the change in online TSE. The study thus concluded that teachers' online TSE for technology application increased among Chinese teachers during COVID-19 school lockdown.

AIMS: To determine the frequency and duration of GI symptoms and predictors of timely specialist review before the diagnosis of both Crohn's Disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: Case-control study of IBD matched 1:4 for age and sex to controls without IBD using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink from 1998-2016. RESULTS: We identified 19,555 cases of IBD, and 78,114 controls. 1 in 4 cases of IBD reported gastrointestinal symptoms to their primary care physician more than 6 months before receiving a diagnosis. There is a significant excess prevalence of GI symptoms in each of the 10 years before IBD diagnosis. GI symptoms were reported by 9.6% and 10.4% at 5 years before CD and UC diagnosis respectively compared to 5.8% of controls. Amongst patients later diagnosed with IBD, <50% received specialist review within 18 months from presenting with chronic GI symptoms. Patients with a previous diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome or depression were less likely to receive timely specialist review (IBS: HR=0.77, 95%CI 0.60-0.99, depression: HR=0.77, 95%CI 0.60-0.98). CONCLUSIONS: There is an excess of GI symptoms 5 years before diagnosis of IBD compared to the background population which are likely attributable to undiagnosed disease. Previous diagnoses of IBS and depression are associated with delays in specialist review. Enhanced pathways are needed to accelerate specialist referral and timely IBD diagnosis.","Blackwell, J; Saxena, S; Jayasooriya, N; Bottle, A; Petersen, I; Hotopf, M; Alexakis, C; Pollok, R C",J. crohns. colitis,572,10

OBJECTIVE: To describe the impact of COVID-19 pandemic in a cohort of Italian psoriatic patients treated with biologics. METHODS: A telephone survey was conducted in May 4-10 2020 about the Italian lockdown period (March 9-May 3 2020) in a cohort of psoriatic patients treated with biologics, asking about any exposure to COVID-19, disease status, continuation of therapy, work activity and psychological status through Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Brief Resilience Scale (BRS). RESULTS: 226 patients were interviewed, with no COVID-19 positive cases. Sixty-three of 226 (27.9%) described worsening of the disease with a correlation to drug withdrawal [43/226 (19%)]. Correlation was also found between the worsening of psoriasis and HADS anxiety, HADS depression, BRS and PSS abnormal scores considered both as categorical and continuous variables. No correlation was found between worsening of psoriasis and work activity. CONCLUSION: Uncertainty about whether biologics could increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection led to drug withdrawal with subsequent worsening of psoriasis.

METHODS: The data on 8,958 twin pairs (3,108 MZ twin pairs and 5,850 DZ twin pairs) from the Twins Early Development Study were analysed. CU traits were assessed at ages 7, 9, 12 and 16 by mothers and analysed using a biometric latent growth model. RESULTS: Individual differences in the baseline level of CU traits were highly heritable (76.5%), while the heritability of the developmental course of CU traits was moderate (43.6%). The genetic influences on baseline level and developmental course of CU traits were mostly nonoverlapping. Nonshared environment made a modest contribution to the baseline level of CU traits (21.7%). Nonshared environmental influences on the developmental course of CU traits were moderate (43.2%), with nearly half of them being the same as those influencing the baseline level and just over half being specific. Shared environmental effects did not contribute to systematic change across childhood and adolescence but were rather age-specific. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that rather than only being conceptualized as factors of stability, genes also play a dynamic role in explaining systematic change in CU traits. Genetic effects for the initial risk and subsequent development of CU traits are not the same. In addition to genetic factors, nonshared environmental influences play an important role in explaining why some children will increase or maintain their CU traits over time, whereas other will desist. New genetic and environmental influences with age suggest that repeated, age-tailored interventions may be required throughout development to make a lasting difference in the presentation of CU traits and associated outcomes.","Takahashi, Yusuke; Pease, Christopher R; Pingault, Jean-Baptiste; Viding, Essi",J. child psychol. psychiatry allied discipl,572,16

However, the time difference between the so-called""G's""is also decreasing. While fifth-generation (5G) systems are becoming a commercial reality, there is already significant interest in systems beyond 5G - which we refer to as the sixth-generation (6G) of wireless systems. In contrast to the many published papers on the topic, we take a top-down approach to 6G. We present a holistic discussion of 6G systems beginning with the lifestyle and societal changes driving the need for next generation networks, to the technical requirements needed to enable 6G applications, through to the challenges, as well as possibilities for practically realizable system solutions across all layers of the Open Systems Interconnection stack. Since many of the 6G applications will need access to an order-of-magnitude more spectrum, utilization of frequencies between 100 GHz and 1 THz becomes of paramount importance. We comprehensively characterize the limitations that must be overcome to realize working systems in these bands; and provide a unique perspective on the physical, as well as higher layer challenges relating to the design of next generation core networks, new modulation and coding methods, novel multiple access techniques, antenna arrays, wave propagation, radio-frequency transceiver design, as well as real-time signal processing. We rigorously discuss the fundamental changes required in the core networks of the future, such as the redesign or significant reduction of the transport architecture that serves as a major source of latency. While evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of key technologies, we differentiate what may be practically achievable over the next decade, relative to what is possible in theory. For each discussed system aspect, we present concrete research challenges.","Tataria, Harsh; Shafi, Mansoor; Molisch, Andreas F.; Dohler, Mischa; Sjoland, Henrik; Tufvesson, Fredrik",,572,10

The virus is spreading not only humans, but it is also affecting animals. First ever case of Coronavirus was registered in city of Wuhan, Hubei province of China on 31st of December in 2019. Coronavirus infected patients display very similar symptoms like pneumonia, and it attacks the respiratory organs of the body, causing difficulty in breathing. The disease is diagnosed using a Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain reaction (RT-PCR) kit and requires time in the laboratory to confirm the presence of the virus. Due to insufficient availability of the kits, the suspected patients cannot be treated in time, which in turn increases the chance of spreading the disease. To overcome this solution, radiologists observed the changes appearing in the radiological images such as X-ray and CT scans. Using deep learning algorithms, the suspected patients' X-ray or Computed Tomography (CT) scan can differentiate between the healthy person and the patient affected by Coronavirus. In this paper, popular deep learning architectures are used to develop a Coronavirus diagnostic systems. The architectures used in this paper are VGG16, DenseNet121, Xception, NASNet, and EfficientNet. Multiclass classification is performed in this paper. The classes considered are COVID-19 positive patients, normal patients, and other class. In other class, chest X-ray images of pneumonia, influenza, and other illnesses related to the chest region are included.

The need for deep learning with radiologic images is necessary for this critical condition as this will provide a second opinion to the radiologists fast and accurately. These deep learning Coronavirus detection systems can also be useful in the regions where expert physicians and well-equipped clinics are not easily accessible.","Nigam, Bhawna; Nigam, Ayan; Jain, Rahul; Dodia, Shubham; Arora, Nidhi; B, Annappa",Expert Syst Appl,572,26

In the absence of pharmaceutical interventions, physical distancing together with testing, contact tracing and quarantining are crucial in slowing down epidemic dynamics. Yet, here we show that if testing capacities are limited, containment may fail dramatically because such combined countermeasures drastically change the rules of the epidemic transition: Instead of continuous, the response to countermeasures becomes discontinuous. Rather than following the conventional exponential growth, the outbreak that is initially strongly suppressed eventually accelerates and scales faster than exponential during an explosive growth period. As a consequence, containment measures either suffice to stop the outbreak at low total case numbers or fail catastrophically if marginally too weak, thus implying large uncertainties in reliably estimating overall epidemic dynamics, both during initial phases and during second wave scenarios.","Scarselli, Davide; Budanur, Nazmi Burak; Timme, Marc; Hof, Björn",Nat Commun,572,10

In this study, concentrations of six criteria pollutants, PM10, PM2.5, CO, NO2, ozone and SO2 during March 16th to April 14th from 2017 to 2020 in 22 cities covering different regions of India were analysed. Overall, around 43, 31, 10, and 18% decreases in PM2.5, PM10, CO, and NO2 in India were observed during lockdown period compared to previous years. While, there were 17% increase in O3 and negligible changes in SO2. The air quality index (AQI) reduced by 44, 33, 29, 15 and 32% in north, south, east, central and western India, respectively. Correlation between cities especially in northern and eastern regions improved in 2020 compared to previous years, indicating more significant regional transport than previous years.

To eliminate the effects of possible favourable meteorology, the WRF-AERMOD model system was also applied in Delhi-NCR with actual meteorology during the lockdown period and an un-favourable event in early November of 2019 and results show that predicted PM2.5 could increase by only 33% in unfavourable meteorology. This study gives confidence to the regulatory bodies that even during unfavourable meteorology, a significant improvement in air quality could be expected if strict execution of air quality control plans is implemented.","Sharma, Shubham; Zhang, Mengyuan; Gao, Jingsi; Zhang, Hongliang; Kota, Sri Harsha",Sci Total Environ,572,10

We identified and characterized EVs from Entamoeba histolytica, a protozoan parasite and a human pathogen. Conditioned medium from amebic parasites contained particles consistent with the expected size and morphology of EVs. Mass spectrometry was used to characterize the EV proteome and showed that it was enriched in common exosome marker proteins including proteins associated with vesicle formation, cell-signaling, metabolism, and cytoskeletal proteins. Additionally, the EVs were found to selectively package small RNAs (sRNA), which were protected within the vesicles against RNase treatment. Sequencing analysis of the sRNA contained in EVs revealed that the majority were 27nt in size and represented a subset of the cellular antisense small RNA population that has previously been characterized in Entamoeba RNAi pathway proteins, including Argonaute were also present in amebic EVs. Interestingly, we found that the amebic EVs impact inter-cellular communication between parasites and altered encystation efficiency. EVs isolated from encysting parasites promoted encystation in other parasites whereas EVs from metabolically active trophozoites impeded encystation. Overall, the data reveals that Entamoeba secrete EVs that are similar in size and shape to previously characterized exosomes from other organisms and that these EVs contain a defined protein and small RNA cargo and have roles in intercellular communication amongst parasites and influence growth kinetics.","Sharma, Manu; Morgado, Pedro; Zhang, Hanbang; Ehrenkaufer, Gretchen; Manna, Dipak; Singh, Upinder",Infect. immun,572,27

The research revealed that the number of accidents increased from 26,082 in 2003 to 27,870 in 2012 with an increased demand for antidotes. The trend analysis of the incidence showed a stationary trend, except for the Crotalus species with an upward trend in the Brazilian aggregate. An upward trend was found in the Cerrado for the Crotalus, Lachesis and Micrurus species: in the Pampa for Crotalus; in the Caatinga for Lachesis and in the Atlantic Forest for Micrurus. The conclusion drawn is that the stationary trend observed for snakebite accidents in Brazil is due to the fact that the majority of these (87%) are caused by snakes of the Bothrops species. However, it should be stressed that there is an increased risk of accidents with snakes of the Crotalus, Lachesis and Micrurus species.","Matos, Rafael Rodrigues; Ignotti, Eliane",Cien Saude Colet,572,22

Various mitigation measures such as business closures have been imposed to reduce health risks. Such measures also limit economic activities and reduce emissions. Measures disproportionately affect the contact-intensive sectors such as the leisure and hospitality industry, as their economic activities involve more person-to-person interactions. Thus, the extent of emission reduction depends on the severity of a measure and the size of the contact-intensive sectors. Using data on business and restaurant closures, school closures and bans on gatherings across 50 U.S. states during the Covid-19 pandemic, an empirical analysis shows that emissions decrease more in states with a more stringent measure and a larger share of the contact-intensive sectors.

Using three-dimensional NMR spectra, molecular dynamics simulations, and alanine mutations, we identified that the interaction network between pT69/pS70 and R106/R109 residues prevents the phosphorylation sites from exposure to phosphatase and subsequent dephosphorylation. A Bcl-2-dephosphorylation probe, S1-6e, was designed by installing a carboxylic acid group to a Bcl-2 inhibitor. The carboxyl group competitively disrupts the interaction network between R106/R109 and pT69/pS70 and subsequently facilitates Bcl-2 dephosphorylation in living cells. As a result, S1-6e manifests a more effective apoptosis induction in pBcl-2-dependent cancer cells than other inhibitors exhibiting a similar binding affinity for Bcl-2. We believe that targeting the allosteric pathways interconnecting the core-functional domain and the phosphorylation site can be a general strategy for a rational design of site-specific dephosphorylating probes, since the allosteric pathway has been discovered in a variety of proteins.","Wang, Ziqian; Song, Ting; Guo, Zongwei; Cao, Keke; Chen, Chao; Feng, Yingang; Wang, Hang; Yin, Fangkui; Zhou, Sheng; Dai, Jian; Zhang, Zhichao",J. med. chem,572,16

She was found to have a significantly elevated D-dimer, prompting imaging that showed thrombi in her right ventricle and aorta. She had rapid clinical deterioration and eventually required tissue plasminogen activator with subsequent durable clinical improvement. This case highlights a rare co-occurrence of venous and arterial thrombi in a patient with severe COVID-19.

Methods: We used a modified Delphi technique to develop a 23-item indicator list to monitor primary health care. We used a multistage cluster random sampling technique to select one district from each of four district clusters, and then select both a family and a primary health centre from each of the four districts. We field-tested and triangulated the indicators using facility data and a population-based household survey. Findings: Our data revealed similarities between facility and survey data for some indicators (e.g. low birth weight and pre-check services), but differences for others (e.g. acute diarrhoeal diseases in children younger than 5 years and blood pressure screening). We made four critical observations: (i) data are available at the facility level but in varying formats; (ii) established global indicators may not always be useful in local monitoring; (iii) operational definitions must be refined; and (iv) triangulation and feedback from the field is vital. Conclusion: We observe that, while data can be used to develop indices of progress, interpretation of these indicators requires great care. In the attainment of universal health coverage, we consider that our observations of the utility of certain health indicators will provide valuable insights for practitioners and supervisors in the development of a primary health-care monitoring mechanism.","Nambiar, Devaki; Sankar, Hari; Negi, Jyotsna; Nair, Arun; Sadanandan, Rajeev",Bull World Health Organ,572,16

It is unclear whether some respiratory support devices may increase the dispersion of infectious bioaerosols and thereby place healthcare workers at increased risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2. OBJECTIVES: To quantitatively compare viral dispersion from invasive and non-invasive respiratory support modalities. METHODS: A simulated intensive care unit room with a breathing patient simulator exhaling nebulized bacteriophage from the lower respiratory tract with various respiratory support modalities: invasive ventilation (through an endotracheal tube with inflated cuff connected to a mechanical ventilator); helmet ventilation with PEEP valve; non-invasive bilevel positive pressure ventilation; non-rebreather face mask; high-flow nasal oxygen; and nasal prongs. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Invasive ventilation and helmet ventilation with a PEEP valve were associated with the lowest bacteriophage concentrations in the air, and high-flow nasal oxygen and nasal prongs the highest. At the intubating position, bacteriophage concentrations associated with high-flow nasal oxygen (2.66 × 104 PFU/L of air sampled), nasal prongs (1.60 × 104 PFU/L of air sampled), non-rebreather facemask (7.87 × 102 PFU/L of air sampled), and BiPAP (1.91 × 102 PFU/L of air sampled) were significantly higher when compared to invasive ventilation (each P < 0.05). The difference between bacteriophage concentrations associated with helmet ventilation with a PEEP valve (4.29 × 10-1 PFU/L of air sampled) and invasive ventilation was not statistically significant.

METHODS: This is a descriptive study. A total of 735 people consisting of 426 health sector employees and 309 service sector employees, constituted the study sample. In this study, the data were collected using the personal information form and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21). A regression model was established to test the effect of socio-demographic characteristics on depression, anxiety, and stress levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: While there was no difference in working a second job across different sectors (p = 0.450), the household income (p < 0.001) and the increase in expenditures during the COVID-19 pandemic (p < 0.001) were different across the sectors. The scores of the overall scale and its sub-dimensions were significantly different across the sectors (p < 0.001). The DASS-21 scores were higher in the participants, who started to smoke more and who had their sleep duration decreased (p < 0.001). There is a statistically significant difference between social media use and the DASS-21 score (p < 0.001). There is a significant difference across all DASS-21 subgroups by the daily working hours in the health sector (p < 0.001).

As a significant public health threat, it has spread worldwide. Scientists and global health experts are collaborating to find and execute speedy diagnostics, robust and highly effective vaccines, and therapeutic techniques to tackle COVID-19. The ocean is an immense source of biologically active molecules and/or compounds with antiviral-associated biopharmaceutical and immunostimulatory attributes. Some specific algae-derived molecules can be used to produce antibodies and vaccines to treat the COVID-19 disease. Algae have successfully synthesized several metabolites as natural defense compounds that enable them to survive under extreme environments. Several algae-derived bioactive molecules and/or compounds can be used against many diseases, including microbial and viral infections. Moreover, some algae species can also improve immunity and suppress human viral activity. Therefore, they may be recommended for use as a preventive remedy against COVID-19. Considering the above critiques and unique attributes, herein, we aimed to systematically assess algae-derived, biologically active molecules that could be used against this disease by looking at their natural sources, mechanisms of action, and prior pharmacological uses.

Cardiovascular disease is a dominant comorbidity and prognostic factors predicting risk for critical courses are highly needed. Moreover, immunomechanisms underlying COVID-induced myocardial damage are poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate prognostic markers to identify patients at risk. RESULTS: Only patients with pericardial effusion (PE) developed a severe disease course, and those who died could be identified by a high CD8/Treg/monocyte ratio. Ten out of 19 COVID-19 patients presented with PE, 7 (78%) of these had elevated APACHE-II mortality risk-score, requiring mechanical ventilation. At admission, PE patients showed signs of systemic and cardiac inflammation in NMR and impaired cardiac function as detected by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), whereas parameters of myocardial injury e.g. high sensitive troponin-t (hs-TnT) were not yet increased. During the course of disease, hs-TnT rose in 8 of the PE-patients above 16 ng/l, 7 had to undergo ventilatory therapy and 4 of them died. FACS at admission showed in PE patients elevated frequencies of CD3+CD8+ T cells among all CD3+ T-cells, and lower frequencies of Tregs and CD14+HLA-DR+-monocytes. A high CD8/Treg/monocyte ratio predicted a severe disease course in PE patients, and was associated with high serum levels of antiviral cytokines. By contrast, patients without PE and PE patients with a low CD8/Treg/monocyte ratio neither had to be intubated, nor died. CONCLUSIONS: PE predicts cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients. Therefore, TTE should be performed at admission. Immunological parameters for dysfunctional antiviral immunity, such as the CD8/Treg/monocyte ratio used here, supports risk assessment by predicting poor prognosis.","Duerr, G D; Heine, A; Hamiko, M; Zimmer, S; Luetkens, J A; Nattermann, J; Rieke, G; Isaak, A; Jehle, J; Held, S A E; Wasmuth, J C; Wittmann, M; Strassburg, C P; Brossart, P; Coburn, M; Treede, H; Nickenig, G; Kurts, C; Velten, M",Life Sci,572,32

Normally, the supply of the energy generation system is determined by the energy demand of manufacturing processes. However, the balance between supply and demand fluctuates frequently due to the uncertainty arising in manufacturing processes. In this paper, we developed an oxygen optimal distribution model considering uncertain demands and proposed a two-stage robust optimization (TSRO) with a budget-based uncertainty set that protects the initial distribution decisions with low conservatism. The main goal of the TSRO model is to make wait-and-see decisions maximizing production profits and make here-and-now decisions minimizing operational stability and surplus/shortage penalty. To represent the uncertainty set of energy demands, we developed a Gaussian process (GP)-based time series model to forecast the energy demands of continuous processes and a capacity-constrained scheduling model to generate multi-scenario energy demands of discrete processes. We carried out extensive computational studies on TSRO and its components using well-synthetic instances from historical data. The results of model validation and analysis are promising and demonstrate our approach is adapted to solve industrial cases under uncertainty.","Jiang, Sheng-Long; Peng, Gongzhuang; Bogle, I.

In the current study, using primary isolated human airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells from normal males versus females as a model, we explored the effect of estrogen versus testosterone in modulating the expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a cell entry point for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Using confocal imaging, we found that ACE2 is expressed in human ASM. Furthermore, Western analysis of ASM cell lysates showed significantly lower ACE2 expression in females compared with males at baseline. In addition, ASM cells exposed to estrogen and testosterone for 24 h showed that testosterone significantly upregulates ACE2 expression in both males and females, whereas estrogen downregulates ACE2, albeit not significant compared with vehicle. These intrinsic and sex steroids induced differences may help explain sex differences in COVID-19.","Kalidhindi, Rama Satyanarayana Raju; Borkar, Niyati A; Ambhore, Nilesh Sudhakar; Pabelick, Christina M; Prakash, Y S; Sathish, Venkatachalem",Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol,572,1

The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on VAE rates and characteristics is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To compare the incidence, causes, and outcomes of VAE during the Covid-19 pandemic year vs pre-pandemic years and amongst ventilated patients with and without Covid-19. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study of mechanically ventilated adults at four academic and community hospitals in Massachusetts, we compared VAE incidence rates between March 1-August 31 for each of 2017-2020 (corresponding to the timeframe of the pandemic first wave in 2020) and among Covid-19 positive and negative patients in 2020. The medical records of 200 randomly selected patients with VAEs in 2020 (100 with Covid-19, 100 without) were analyzed to compare conditions precipitating VAEs in patients with vs without Covid-19. RESULTS: VAEs per 100 episodes of mechanical ventilation were more common in 2020 vs prior years (11.2 vs 6.7, p<.01) but the rate of VAEs per 1000 ventilator-days was similar (14.2 vs 12.7, p=.08). VAEs were more frequent in Covid-19 positive vs negative patients within 2020 (29.0 vs. 7.1 per 100 ventilator episodes, p<.01 and 17.2 vs 12.2 per 1000 ventilator days, p<.01). Compared to non-Covid-19 patients with VAEs, Covid-19 patients with VAEs had similar rates of infection-related ventilator-associated complications, longer median duration of mechanical ventilation (22 vs 14 days, p<.01), and similar in-hospital mortality (30% vs 38%, p=.15). Progressive ARDS accounted for 53% of VAEs in Covid-19 patients versus 14% amongst non-Covid-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: VAE rates per 100 episodes of mechanical ventilation and per 1000 ventilator days were higher amongst Covid-19 positive versus negative patients. Over 50% of VAEs in Covid-19 patients were caused by progressive ARDS versus less than 15% in patients without Covid-19. These findings provide insight into the natural history of Covid-19 in ventilated patients and may inform targeted strategies to mitigate complications in this population.","Weinberger, Jeremy; Rhee, Chanu; Klompas, Michael",Ann.

Malnutrition is associated with poor prognosis and early detection of malnutrition and timely nutritional interventions can improve the outcome for cervical cancer patients. The study was aimed to assess the association between the nutritional status and survival of cervical cancer patients. METHODS: A prospective cohort study design was used. Overall 175 cervical cancer patients were followed over one year period with (median 8.5 mo, range (3.6-12). RESULTS: The prevalence of malnutrition determined by means of the PG-SGA was 17.7% at admission and 47.1% at the end of follow-up. According to the SGA, one in three (29.7%) patients required nutritional intervention at the end of follow-up. Patients who were malnourished (PG-SGA-B and C) had an increased risk of mortality (Hazard Ratio [HR]: 3.12, 95% CI: 1.23 - 7.86) as compared to those who were well nourished (PG-SGA-A). Patients from rural areas had an increased risk of mortality (HR: 6.99, 95% CI: 2.07 - 23.58) compared to patients from urban areas. CONCLUSION: In the context of developing country setting and COVID19 outbreak, malnutrition significantly decreases cervical cancer survival. A thorough nutrition assessment using scored PG-SGA is needed.","Argefa, Terefe Gelibo; Roets, Lizeth",Nutr Cancer,572,16

Soon COVID-19 was spread around the world and became a pandemic. Now many patients around the world are suffering from this disease. Patients with predisposing diseases are highly prone to COVID-19 and manifesting severe infection especially with organ function damage such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, septic shock, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and death. Till now many drugs have been considered in the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia, but pharmacotherapy in elderly patients and patients with pre-existing comorbidities is highly challenging. In this review, different potential drugs which have been considered in COVID-19 treatment have been discussed in detail.

Evaluate the effects of pandemic on mental health of dermatologists on a large scale and identify risk factors for mental distress. 733 dermatologists were included in this cross-sectional, web-based survey. Mental distress was reported by 77.2% of responders. Considerable percentages of participants experienced stress (73.9%), irritation (33.7%), insomnia (30%), or depression (27.6%), and 78.6% were overwhelmed with the amount of pandemic information they were receiving. Mental distress was significantly associated with practice years, volume of patients seen per week before pandemic, personal protective equipment availability at hospital (P = .001 for each), practice location (continent; P < .001), and participant's assessment that the healthcare system was not equipped for the pandemic (P = .003). Stress was associated with hospital service (P = .003), and depression with being overwhelmed with the amount of pandemic information received (P = .004). In a logistic model, teledermatology use was the most powerful predictor of mental distress (OR, 1.57 [95% CI, 1.07-2.32]). Mental distress was common among dermatologists during this pandemic.

We described barriers to accessing naloxone among individuals who requested and received the medication from a free mailed program and explored the relationship between how individuals with and without personal proximity to overdose learned about the program. METHODS: Secondary analysis of data from a web-based form collected 1st March 2020 to 31st January 2021. Access barriers, personal proximity to overdose (broadly defined as personally overdosing or witnessing/worrying about others overdosing), and method of learning about the program were categorized and described. RESULTS: Among 422 respondents, the most frequently reported barriers to accessing naloxone were: COVID quarantine (25.1%), lack of knowledge about access (13.2%), and cost (11.2%). Compared to those without personal proximity to overdose (38.2%), individuals with personal proximity (61.8%) heard about the program more often through an active online search (21.4% vs. 8.8%; p-value = 0.001) and less often through word of mouth (19.8% vs. 40.9%; p-value = <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Longstanding barriers to naloxone access are compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic, making mailing programs especially salient. Differences in ways that individuals with and without personal proximity to substance use and overdose learned about this program can inform how such programs can effectively reach their target audience.","French, Rachel; Favaro, Jamie; Aronowitz, Shoshana V",Int J Drug Policy,572,16

Biases in data-driven methods carry the risk of amplifying inequalities in high-stakes policy decisions that impact the livelihood of millions of people. Consequently, proclaimed benefits of data-driven innovations remain inaccessible to policymakers, practitioners, and marginalized communities at the core of humanitarian actions and global development. To help fill this gap, we propose the Data-driven Humanitarian Mapping Research Program, which focuses on developing novel data science methodologies that harness human-machine intelligence for high-stakes public policy and resilience planning.

We aimed to evaluate the impact of COVID-19-related public health guidelines on physical activity (PA), sedentary behavior, mental health, and their interrelations. Cross-sectional data were collected from 3052 US adults 3-8 April 2020 (from all 50 states). Participants self-reported pre- and post-COVID-19 levels of moderate and vigorous PA, sitting, and screen time. Currently-followed public health guidelines, stress, loneliness, positive mental health (PMH), social connectedness, and depressive and anxiety symptoms were self-reported. Participants were grouped by meeting US PA guidelines, reporting &#8805;8 h/day of sitting, or &#8805;8 h/day of screen time, pre- and post-COVID-19. Overall, 62% of participants were female, with age ranging from 18-24 (16.6% of sample) to 75+ (9.3%). Self-reported PA was lower post-COVID among participants reporting being previously active (mean change: -32.3% [95% CI: -36.3%, -28.1%]) but largely unchanged among previously inactive participants (+2.3% [-3.5%, +8.1%]). No longer meeting PA guidelines and increased screen time were associated with worse depression, loneliness, stress, and PMH (p < 0.001). Self-isolation/quarantine was associated with higher depressive and anxiety symptoms compared to social distancing (p < 0.001). Maintaining and enhancing physical activity participation and limiting screen time increases during abrupt societal changes may mitigate the mental health consequences.","Meyer, Jacob; McDowell, Cillian; Lansing, Jeni; Brower, Cassandra; Smith, Lee; Tully, Mark; Herring, Matthew",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),572,1

The aim of this study was to evaluate associations of plasma 25(OH)D levels with the likelihood of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and hospitalization. The study population included the 14 000 members of Leumit Health Services, who were tested for COVID-19 infection from February 1st to April 30th , 2020, and who had at least one previous blood test for the plasma 25(OH)D level. 'Suboptimal' or 'low' plasma 25(OH)D level was defined as plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D, or 25(OH)D, concentration below the level of 30 ng/mL. Of 7807 individuals, 782 (10.02%) were COVID-19-positive, and 7025 (89.98%) COVID-19-negative. The mean plasma vitamin D level was significantly lower among those who tested positive than negative for COVID-19 [19.00 ng/mL1 (95% confidence interval (CI) 18.41-19.59) vs. 20.55 (95% CI: 20.32-20.78)]. Univariate analysis demonstrated an association between the low plasma 25(OH)D level and increased likelihood of COVID-19 infection [crude odds ratio (OR) of 1.58 (95% CI: 1.24-2.01, P < 0.001)], and of hospitalization due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus [crude OR of 2.09 (95% CI: 1.01-4.30, P < 0.05)]. In multivariate analyses that controlled for demographic variables, and psychiatric and somatic disorders, the adjusted OR of COVID-19 infection [1.45 (95% CI: 1.08-1.95, P < 0.001)] and of hospitalization due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus [1.95 (95% CI: 0.98-4.845, P = 0.061)] were preserved. In the multivariate analyses, age over 50 years, male gender and low-medium socioeconomic status were also positively associated with the risk of COVID-19 infection; age over 50 years was positively associated with the likelihood of hospitalization due to COVID-19. We concluded that low plasma 25(OH)D levels appear to be an independent risk factor for COVID-19 infection and hospitalization.","Merzon, Eugene; Tworowski, Dmitry; Gorohovski, Alessandro; Vinker, Shlomo; Golan Cohen, Avivit; Green, Ilan; Frenkel-Morgenstern, Milana",FEBS j,572,33

320647,320647,320647,Remdesivir and COVID-19,16.628353,6.4060993,2020,"Background. Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a significant cause of disability in a globally ageing population. Knee replacement surgery has been shown to improve function and quality of life. Access to this intervention can be limited for a number of reasons including rationing of care, lack of healthcare provision in austere environments, and more recently, due to the cessation of elective orthopaedic care as a result of the COVID pandemic. Referral for knee replacement surgery is often guided by the patient's Oxford Knee Score (OKS). Recent therapies including treatment with microfragmented adipose tissue (MFAT) have emerged as alternatives to relieve pain and improve function in such patients. Method. We identified all patients with KOA Kellgren-Lawrence grade 3 and 4 in our dataset of patients treated with a single injection of MFAT and applied published OKS thresholds for referral for TKR to separate them into 3 cohorts according to their functional impairment. 220 patients (95 females, 125 males) with KOA were given one MFAT injection. The function (OKS) and quality of life (EuroQol-5) prior to and 24 months after therapy were compared. Results. MFAT injection provided a statistically significant improvement in the quality of life (EQ-5D) at 24 months in patients with a baseline OKS of 39 or less (p value: &lt;0.001) as well as those with OKS of 27 or less who are deemed suitable for a knee replacement (p value: &lt;0.001). Conclusion. MFAT injection improves quality of life in patients with KOA who are deemed suitable for the knee replacement. MFAT is a low-morbidity alternative biological treatment and can delay the need for total knee replacement in suitable patients.

COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown from 9 March to 16 May 2020 have potentially influenced several activities, including ECs. OBJECTIVES: to assess the impact of COVID-19 outbreak on Italian ECs and their performance during the lockdown. DESIGN: cross-sectional survey. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: the survey was conducted in mid-June 2020 in Italy contacting all the 90 local ECs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: amount and kind of activities performed during the lockdown, characteristics of submitted studies and adoption of standard protocols of evaluation of research applications during the pandemic. Chi-square test was used to estimate the differences between territories with higher incidence (HI) and lower incidence (LI) of COVID-19. RESULTS: 258 questionnaires were collected from 46 ECs that participated in the study. Ten were excluded due to missing substantial data. Responses were divided into two groups according to location of EC: the HI (125 responses) and the LI (123 responses). Seventy-five percent of the HI describe an increase in the number of studies submitted, while 53% of the LI does not (p=0.001). Due to the pandemic and its effects on research, the 15% of participants belonging to HI territories reported that consideration and respect of research-related and general ethical principles could have decreased, as well the adoption of standard protocols of evaluation of research applications. EC secretariats located in HI Regions moved to smart working more than in LI ones (75% vs 59%; p=0.001). Where the EC workload increased significantly, it was reported that it was impossible to perform an accurate analysis of the submitted documentation, with the effect of providing a favorable opinion to studies of not excellent quality, though always ensuring the respect of ethical principles and patients' safety. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 impact on ECs has been heavier in HI territories, but smart working has been effective in ensuring EC activities and the subsequent activation of clinical studies potentially useful to face the pandemic. Clear differences arise between ECs belonging to the Italian Regions that have recorded a HI of COVID-19 cases compared to those located in Regions with a LI of cases. In some EC members' perception, the high number of studies in the most affected Regions together with the emergency experienced during the lockdown may have exposed ECs to the risk of decreasing the adoption of ethical principles and standard protocols of evaluation of research applications.","Monaco, Eleonora; Pisano, Lorenza; Nasato, Laura; Lorenzoni, Giulia; Gregori, Dario; Martinato, Matteo",Epidemiol Prev,572,2

Chromogenic assay produces false positives, mainly due to spectrophotometric interferences and sample purity issues. pf-ACE was selected as counter-screening technology because of its separative character and the fact that the target does not have to be attached or tagged. The effects of protein plug length, applied voltage and composition of the running buffer were examined and optimized. Detection limit in terms of dissociation constant was estimated at 400 µM. The affinity evaluation was performed close to physiological conditions (pH 7.4, ionic strength 0.13 mol L-1) in a poly (ethylene oxide)-coated capillary of 75 µm internal diameter x 33 cm length with an applied voltage of 3 kV.

HIV infection impairs gut homeostasis and is associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 fatality. To investigate the potential link between these observations, we analyzed single-cell transcriptional profiles and SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor expression across lymphoid and mucosal human tissue from chronically HIV-infected individuals and uninfected controls. Absorptive gut enterocytes displayed the highest coexpression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors ACE2, TMPRSS2, and TMPRSS4, of which ACE2 expression was associated with canonical interferon response and antiviral genes. Chronic treated HIV infection was associated with a clear antiviral response in gut enterocytes and, unexpectedly, with a substantial reduction of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 target cells. Gut tissue from SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals, however, showed abundant SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein in both the large and small intestine, including an HIV-coinfected individual. Thus, upregulation of antiviral response genes and downregulation of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the GI tract of HIV-infected individuals does not prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in this compartment. The impact of these HIV-associated intestinal mucosal changes on SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics, disease severity, and vaccine responses remains unclear and requires further investigation.","Fardoos, Rabiah; Asowata, Osaretin E; Herbert, Nicholas; Nyquist, Sarah K; Zungu, Yenzekile; Singh, Alveera; Ngoepe, Abigail; Mbano, Ian M; Mthabela, Ntombifuthi; Ramjit, Dirhona; Karim, Farina; Kuhn, Warren; Madela, Fusi G; Manzini, Vukani T; Anderson, Frank; Berger, Bonnie; Pers, Tune H; Shalek, Alex K; Leslie, Alasdair; Kløverpris, Henrik N",JCI insight,572,24

Data sourcesSecondary data of patients that visited emergency department of Vlora Regional hospital Albania (largest hospital in the south of the country), since January 1, 2017 till December 31, 2020. Study DesignThis is a retrospective study. We used the hard copy of the patients health register records. Extraction methodsThe data extraction was conducted during March 2021 till June 2021. Eligible were all patients admitted and recorded in the registry of the Emergency department. The causes of admission were categorized in 14 different disease categories. All registered patient admitted to the Vlora regional hospital were included in the study. Patients that all data were not recorded and patients that data were not possible to be read were excluded. Principal FindingsStudy population included 44.917 patients during 2017-2020. Mean age of patients was 51.5 years, while 53.6% were females. The highest number of patients was in 2017 (n=12.407) and the lowest in 2020 (n=9.266). Increase of patients presented with cardiovascular, psychiatric and renal/urinary tract were observed in 2020 in comparison to 2019. Patients decreased over time with an average annual percent decrease of -7% (p-value=0.22). Joinpoint analysis revealed that mortality rate increased over time with an average annual percent increase of 34.3% (95% confidence interval= -42.7% to 214.8%, p-value=0.27). ConclusionsDuring the study years the number of patients visiting emergency department decreased while mortality rate increased. Educating and raising awareness of patient to seek medical assistance should be a key objective of health policy makers and health personnel. A specific focus should be put on the more vulnerable (elderly and unemployed) as their health status is in higher risk.","Bucaj, Jorgjia; Mechili, Enkeleint A.; Galanis, Petros; Mersini, Bruna; Nika, Sonila; Hoxhaj, Inis; Likaj, Stefano; Patelarou, Athina E.; Patelarou, Evridiki",,572,1

In order to permit the monitoring of the evolution of this number, a new estimation procedure is proposed here, assuming a well-accepted model for current incidence data, based on past observations. The novelty of the proposed approach is twofold: 1) the estimation of the reproduction number is achieved by convex optimization within a proximal-based inverse problem formulation, with constraints aimed at promoting piecewise smoothness; 2) the approach is developed in a multivariate setting, allowing for the simultaneous handling of multiple time series attached to different geographical regions, together with a spatial (graph-based) regularization of their evolutions in time. The effectiveness of the approach is first supported by simulations, and two main applications to real COVID-19 data are then discussed. The first one refers to the comparative evolution of the reproduction number for a number of countries, while the second one focuses on French departments and their joint analysis, leading to dynamic maps revealing the temporal co-evolution of their reproduction numbers.","Abry, Patrice; Pustelnik, Nelly; Roux, Stéphane; Jensen, Pablo; Flandrin, Patrick; Gribonval, Rémi; Lucas, Charles-Gérard; Guichard, Éric; Borgnat, Pierre; Garnier, Nicolas",PLoS One,572,7

However, the extreme interconnectedness of southern African countries facilitates the constant movement of malaria parasites across country-borders, predominately from higher-burden “source” countries to lower-burden “sink” countries, reinforcing the notion that malaria elimination in any southern African country would not be possible without regional cooperation and collaboration. The Elimination 8 initiative (E8) was therefore, created by Health Ministers from eight countries (Angola, Botswana, Eswatini, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe) to coordinate the implementation of a regional malaria elimination strategy. The E8 supported the implementation of five cross-border malaria control initiatives and the deployment of malaria health units at strategic points along shared borders. These units have contributed to a 30% and 46% reduction in malaria incidence and mortality, respectively, in the E8 border regions. The Situation Room, a novel data sharing platform developed and supported by the E8, has allowed for the early detection of and prompt response to malaria outbreaks. This platform played a vital role in identifying resources gaps due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite advancing the elimination agenda, the E8 region faces challenges which include, significant increases in malaria in certain member states, limited domestic funding and health system bottlenecks. These must be urgently addressed if the gains made through the E8 are to be sustained and malaria elimination is to be achieved across southern Africa.

However, performance data are lacking, especially in asymptomatic people. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing when used for facility-wide testing during a nursing home outbreak. DESIGN: A prospective evaluation involving 3 facility-wide rounds of testing where paired respiratory specimens were collected to evaluate the performance of the BinaxNOW antigen test compared with virus culture and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Early and late infection were defined using changes in RT-PCR cycle threshold values and prior test results. SETTING: A nursing home with an ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. PARTICIPANTS: 532 paired specimens collected from 234 available residents and staff. MEASUREMENTS: Percentage of positive agreement (PPA) and percentage of negative agreement (PNA) for BinaxNOW compared with RT-PCR and virus culture. RESULTS: BinaxNOW PPA with virus culture, used for detection of replication-competent virus, was 95%. However, the overall PPA of antigen testing with RT-PCR was 69%, and PNA was 98%. When only the first positive test result was analyzed for each participant, PPA of antigen testing with RT-PCR was 82% among 45 symptomatic people and 52% among 343 asymptomatic people. Compared with RT-PCR and virus culture, the BinaxNOW test performed well in early infection (86% and 95%, respectively) and poorly in late infection (51% and no recovered virus, respectively). LIMITATION: Accurate symptom ascertainment was challenging in nursing home residents; test performance may not be representative of testing done by nonlaboratory staff. CONCLUSION: Despite lower positive agreement compared with RT-PCR, antigen test positivity had higher agreement with shedding of replication-competent virus. These results suggest that antigen testing could be a useful tool to rapidly identify contagious people at risk for transmitting SARS-CoV-2 during nascent outbreaks and help reduce COVID-19 burden in nursing homes.

Due to the lack of broad diagnostic setup, consistent reagent supply lines, and access to laboratory instruments and equipment, it is undoubtedly an enormous burden for developing countries to face the crisis. OBJECTIVES: To develop a cost-effective, reliable and sensitive multiplex assay for SARS-CoV-2 screening which would expand the testing capacities of a developing and low-income country like Bangladesh. STUDY DESIGN: Initially a singleplex and then a multiplex real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR assays were developed targeting 2 nucleocapsid genes of SARS-CoV-2, and the human RNase P gene as an internal control using laboratory-made mastermixes. Three sets of primer- probes were designed for each of the target genes and one set was optimized for the final reaction set-up. Limit of detection, cross-reactivity and reproducibility were checked in order to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the assays, and validation was done using clinical specimens. RESULTS: Clinical evaluation of the new assays using 240 nasopharyngeal swabs showed 100 % sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection in human. Equal efficiency and concordant results were observed between the singleplex and multiplex approaches. Notably, the kit was able to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA at very low concentration upto 5 copies/reaction. CONCLUSION: This is the first locally developed multiplex rRT-PCR kit in Bangladesh providing rapid and low-cost screening of COVID-19 which would be valuable for infection prevention and clinical management in the perspective of Bangladesh.","Noor, Farjana Akther; Safain, Kazi Sarjana; Hossain, Md Walid; Arafath, Khalid; Mannoor, Kaiissar; Kabir, Mazbahul",J Virol Methods,572,1

METHODS: Patients affected by migraine with or without aura, diagnosed by expert physicians, completed a detailed interview comprehensive of: assessment of migraine characteristics; measure of physical activity (PA) levels; measure of the intake frequency of main Italian foods; the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) questionnaire investigating sleep disorders. RESULTS: We included 261 patients with a mean age of 44.5 ± 12.3 years. During social distancing, 72 patients (28%) reported a headache worsening, 86 (33%) an improvement, and 103 (39%) a stable headache frequency. A significant decrease of the PA levels during COVID-19 quarantine in the whole study sample was observed (median total metabolic equivalent task (METs) decreased from 1170 to 510; p < 0.001). Additionally, a significant difference was reported on median ISI scores (from 7 to 8; p < 0.001), which were increased in patients who presented a stable or worsening headache.

However, comparison to prevalence in uninfected individuals and contribution from common risk factors (e.g., obesity, comorbidities) have not been examined. We identified how COVID-19 relates to mental health in the large community-based COVID Symptom Study. MethodsWe assessed anxiety and depression symptoms using two validated questionnaires in 413,148 individuals between February and April 2021; 26,998 had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. We adjusted for physical and mental pre-pandemic comorbidities, BMI, age, and sex. FindingsOverall, 26.4% of participants met screening criteria for general anxiety and depression. Anxiety and depression were slightly more prevalent in previously SARS-CoV-2 positive (30.4%) vs. negative (26.1%) individuals. This association was small compared to the effect of an unhealthy BMI and the presence of other comorbidities, and not evident in younger participants ([≤]40 years). Findings were robust to multiple sensitivity analyses. Association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and anxiety and depression was stronger in individuals with recent (<30 days) vs. more distant (>120 days) infection, suggesting a short-term effect. InterpretationA small association was identified between SARS-CoV-2 infection and anxiety and depression symptoms. The proportion meeting criteria for self-reported anxiety and depression disorders is only slightly higher than pre-pandemic.

A widespread association of repurposed agents is the combination of the antimalarial drug Hydroxychloroquine and the macrolide antibiotic Azithromycin in the setting of clinical trials. But a closer analysis of their mechanism of action suggests that their concomitant administration may be impractical, and this is supported by experimental data with other agents of the same classes. However a sequential administration of the lysosomotropic antimalarial with the addition of the macrolide proton pump inhibitor after the first has reached a certain threshold could better exploit their antiviral potential.","Cismaru, Cosmin Andrei; Cismaru, Gabriel Laurentiu; Seyed Nabavi, Fazel; Seyed Nabavi, Mohammad; Berindan-Neagoe, Ioana",Eur J Pharmacol,572,16

METHODS: A total of 45 endodontic procedures were sampled, including full pulpotomy (n = 15), pulpectomy (n = 15), and NSRCT (n = 15). Samples were collected during room resting and after treatment. The passive air sampling technique using settle plates was applied. Agar plates were set at different locations in the operatory. The colony-forming unit (CFU) was counted in brain-heart infusion blood agar plates. A set of agar plates containing selective chromogenic culture media was used for the isolation and presumptive identification of target microorganisms. Fungi were investigated using Sabouraud dextrose agar. RESULTS: Pulpotomy generated the lowest mean CFU count (P < .05). There was no difference between the mean CFU counts found in pulpectomy and NSRCT (P > .05). A higher mean CFU count was found close to the patient's mouth (0.5 m) than at a 2-m distance in pulpectomy and NSRCT (P < .05). There was no difference between the mean CFU count found in front of the patient's mouth versus diagonal in pulpectomy and NSRCT (P > .05). Staphylococcus aureus (22/45, 48.8%) was the most frequent bacteria species. Longer treatment times were associated with higher CFU counts. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated that pulpotomy generates less aerosolized microorganisms than pulpectomy and NSRCT. The proximity to the patient's mouth and the treatment duration were implicated in the level of contamination.","Bahador, Mason; Alfirdous, Rayyan A; Alquria, Theeb A; Griffin, Ina L; Tordik, Patricia A; Martinho, Frederico C",J. endod,572,15

This study was a descriptive and cross-sectional study. The study sample included 154 parents of 7- to 10-year-old students. Participant information form and the Family-Child Internet Addiction Scale were used as data collection tools. The data of the study were collected with a questionnaire (via Google Forms) between July 15 and December 15, 2020. Of the children participating in the study, 90.3% (n=139) showed no symptoms and 9.7% (n=15) showed limited symptoms in terms of internet addiction. The total mean score that the children obtained from the scale was found to be 24.6 +/- 16.9. It was observed that the frequency of a child playing games with parents, the parents watching news about COVID-19 with the child, and the child being frequently warned about the COVID-19 precautions increased the children's internet addiction scores (p&lt;0.05). This study demonstrated that if the pandemic process was prolonged, internet addiction in children could be further triggered.","Akozlu, Z.; Kolukisa, T.; Sahin, O.

It then spread with enormous rapidity and by mid-March 2020 was declared a world pandemic. Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome (GTS) is a childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorder with a worldwide prevalence of about 1% of the population. The clinical symptoms include multiple motor and one or more phonic (vocal) tics. Germane to this communication is that 85% of patients with GTS have associated psychiatric co-morbidities, many of which are being exacerbated in the current global health crisis. In addition, several symptoms of GTS may mimic COVID-19, such as a dry cough and sniffing (phonic tics), while other symptoms such as spitting, inappropriate touching of others and ""non-obscene socially inappropriate symptoms"" can potentially get patients with GTS into trouble with the law. We suggest that a clear explanation of the COVID-19 illness and GTS is important to enable colleagues of various specialities who tend to patients with GTS. It is important to acknowledge at the outset that the information available on the COVID-19 pandemic changes daily, including cases infected, deaths reported, and how various national health systems are planning and or coping or not.

However, there are limited studies on the specificity of olfactory and gustatory changes in patients with COVID-19, and it is unclear to what extent the changes may be unique to the disease. This study aimed to evaluate the duration and outcome of olfactory and gustatory disorders in patients with COVID-19. Methods: The study population was patients with COVID-19 at Afzalipour Hospital whose disease was confirmed by nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. 20 patients with olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions were studied. Data were collected using two forms, which were completed at the time of diagnosis and two weeks after the onset of the disease. Results: In 20% of the patients, olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions were among the early symptoms. In 85% of the cases, these dysfunctions were permanent during the disease. 30% of the cases had a chronic underlying disease such as sinusitis, nasal polyps, and allergy. In follow-up, 13 patients (60%) reported that their olfactory dysfunctions had completely improved. Conclusion: The patients whose only symptom is the sudden olfactory or gustatory dysfunction or the dysfunctions are among their early symptoms, should be screened for COVID-19. Most of the patients will recover over the time. Copyright: 2021 The Author(s);Published by Kerman University of Medical Sciences.

TRIAL DESIGN: The CARED trial is an investigator-initiated, multicentre, randomized, parallel, two-arm, sequential, double-blind and placebo-controlled clinical trial. It was planned as a pragmatic trial since the inclusion criteria are broad and the study procedures are as simple as possible, in order to be implemented in the routine clinical practice in general wards in the pandemic setting and a middle-income country context. The sequential design involves two stages. The first stage will assess the effects of vitamin D supplementation on blood oxygenation (physiological effects). The second stage will assess the effects on clinical outcomes. PARTICIPANTS: Participants of either gender admitted to general adult wards in 21 hospital sites located in four provinces of Argentina are invited to participate in the study if they meet the following inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria: Inclusion criteria SARS-CoV-2 confirmed infection by RT-PCR; Hospital admission at least 24 hours before; Expected hospitalization in the same site &#8805;24 hours; Oxygen saturation &#8805;90% (measured by pulse oximetry) breathing ambient air; Age &#8805;45 years or at least one of the following conditions: â Hypertension; â Diabetes; â At least moderate COPD or asthma; â Cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, coronary artery bypass grafting or valve replacement surgery); â Body mass index &#8805;30; Willingness to sign informed consent (online supplementary material 1 and 2). EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Age <18 years; Women in childbearing age; >= 72 hs since current admission; Requirement for a high dose of oxygen (>5 litres/minute) or mechanical ventilation (non-invasive or invasive); History of chronic kidney disease requiring haemodialysis or chronic liver failure; Inability for oral intake. Chronic supplementation with pharmacological vitamin D; Current treatment with anticonvulsants; History of: â Sarcoidosis; â Malabsorption syndrome; â Known hypercalcemia or serum calcium >10.5 mg/dL; Life expectancy <6 months; Known allergy to study medication; Any condition at discretion of investigator impeding to understand the study and give informed consent. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: The intervention consists in a single oral dose of 500.000 IU of commercially available cholecalciferol soft gel capsules (5 capsules of 100.000 IU) or matching placebo MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome for the first stage is the change in the respiratory Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFAr) score between pre-treatment value and the worst value recorded during the first 7 seven days of hospitalization, the death or discharge, whichever occurs first. The SOFAr score measured as the ratio between the pulse oximetry saturation (SpO2) and FiO2 (27, 28) is used instead of the arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2). SOFAr score is a 4-points scale, with higher values indicating deeper respiratory derangement as follows: 1 PaO2 <400; 2 PaO2 <300; 3 PaO2 <200; 4 PaO2 <100. The primary outcome for the second stage is the combined occurrence of requirement &#8805;40% of FiO2, invasive or non-invasive ventilation, up to 30 days or hospital discharge. RANDOMISATION: A computer-generated random sequence and the treatment assignment is performed through the web-based randomization module available in the electronic data capture system (Castor®). A randomization ratio 1:1, stratified and with permuted blocks was used. Stratification variables were diabetes (yes/no), age (&#8804;60/>60 years) and the site. BLINDING (MASKING): Double-blind was achieved by using placebo soft gel capsules with the same organoleptic properties as the active medication. Central management of the medication is carried out by a pharmacist in charge of packaging the study drug in unblinded fashion, who have no contact with on-site investigators. Medication is packaged in opaque white bottles, each containing five soft gel capsules of the active drug or matching placebo, corresponding to complete individual treatment. Treatment codes are kept under the pharmacist responsibility, and all researchers are unaware of them. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The first stage is planned to include 200 patients (100 per group), the second stage is planned to include 1064 additional patients. The total sample size is 1264 patients. TRIAL STATUS: Currently the protocol version is the number 1.4 (from October 13th, 2020). The recruitment is ongoing since August 11th, 2020, and the first subject was enrolled on August 14th. Since then, 21 sites located in four provinces of Argentina were initiated, and 167 patients were recruited by January 11th, 2021. We anticipate to finish the recruitment for the first stage in mid-February, 2021, and in August, 2021 for the second stage.

This study aimed to investigate the qualitative impact of COVID-19 on surgical training in the United Kingdom (UK) & Republic of Ireland (ROI) METHODS: This national, collaborative, cross-sectional study involving 13 surgical trainee associations distributed a pan-surgical specialty questionnaire on the impact of COVID-19 on surgical training over 4 weeks in May 2020. Various aspects of training were assessed. RESULTS: 810 completed responses were analysed (malesâ¯=â¯401, femalesâ¯=â¯390) from all deaneries and training grades. The perceived negative overall impact of the pandemic on surgical training experience was significant. (Weighted averageâ¯=â¯8.66). 41% of respondents (nâ¯=â¯301) were redeployed with 74% redeployed for >4 weeks.

A reduction of >50% was reported in emergency operating (48%) and completion of work-based assessments (WBAs) (46%). 3.3% (nâ¯=â¯17) of respondents reported plans to leave medicine altogether. Cancellations in study leave and regional teaching programmes without rescheduling were reported in 72% and 60% of the cohort respectively. Elective operative exposure and WBAs completion were the primary reported factors affecting potential trainee progression. Only 9% of trainees reported that they would definitely meet all required competencies. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has had a negative impact on surgical training across all grades and specialties, with implications for trainee progression, recruitment and retention of the surgical workforce.

According to clinical studies carried out in China and Italy, most patients experience mild or moderate symptoms; about a fifth of subjects develop a severe and critical disease, and may suffer from interstitial pneumonia, possibly associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death.In patients who develop respiratory failure, timely conventional oxygen therapy through nasal catheter plays a crucial role, but it can be used only in mild forms. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) support or non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) are uncomfortable, and require significant man-machine cooperation. Herein we describe our experience of five patients with COVID-19, who were treated with high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) after failure of CPAP or NIV, and discuss the role of HFNC in COVID-19 patients. Our findings suggest that HFNC can be used successfully in selected patients with COVID-19-related ARDS.The reviews of this paper are available via the supplemental material section.","Procopio, Giada; Cancelliere, Anna; Trecarichi, Enrico Maria; Mazzitelli, Maria; Arrighi, Eugenio; Perri, Graziella; Serapide, Francesca; Pelaia, Corrado; Lio, Elena; Busceti, Maria Teresa; Pelle, Maria Chiara; Ricchio, Marco; Scaglione, Vincenzo; Davoli, Chiara; Fusco, Paolo; La Gamba, Valentina; Torti, Carlo; Pelaia, Girolamo",Ther Adv Respir Dis,572,20

High morbidity and mortality rates of COVID-19 have been observed among older adults and widely reported in both mainstream and social media. The objective of this study was to analyze tweets related to COVID-19 and older adults, and to identify ageist content. DESIGN: We obtained a representative sample of original tweets containing the keywords ""elderly,"" ""older,"" and/or ""boomer"" plus the hashtags ""#COVID19"" and/or ""#coronavirus."" SETTING: Tweets posted between March 12 and March 21, 2020. MEASUREMENTS: We identified the type of user and number of followers for each account. Tweets were classified by three raters as (1) informative, (2) personal accounts, (3) personal opinions, (4) advice seeking, (5) jokes, and (6) miscellaneous. Potentially offensive content, as well as that downplaying the severity of COVID-19 because it mostly affects older adults, was identified. RESULTS: A total of 18,128 tweets were obtained, of which a random sample of 351 was analyzed. Most accounts (91.7%) belonged to individuals. The most common types of tweets were personal opinions (31.9%), followed by informative tweets (29.6%), jokes/ridicule (14.3%), and personal accounts (13.4%). Overall, 72 tweets (21.9%) likely intended to ridicule or offend someone and 21.1% had content implying that the life of older adults was less valuable or downplayed the relevance of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Most tweets related to COVID-19 and older adults contained personal opinions, personal accounts, and jokes. Almost one-quarter of analyzed tweets had ageist or potentially offensive content toward older adults.

The objective of this quality improvement study was to increase the frequency and quality of communication with LEP families in the PICU through improved access and functionality of video interpreters. METHODS: Interpretation data from our tertiary PICU were obtained and monitored starting in 2019. A key driver diagram was utilized to develop potential interventions. Multiple PDSA cycles were completed to evaluate interventions including providing written instructions on video interpreter use, obtaining new standardized video interpreter devices, designating standard locations and staff education around effective interpretation. Statistical process control was employed to analyze the number of interpretations per LEP patient per day based on hospital billing data. RESULTS: There were 82 encounters requiring interpretation during the study period, with an average of seven LEP families in the PICU on any given day. During the preimplementation phase (September-December 2019), LEP families received an average of 1.5 interpretations per patient day. After implementation (January-May 2020), LEP families received an average of 2.1 interpretations per patient day. CONCLUSIONS: Targeted efforts towards using interpretation services with LEP families can be an effective way to increase frequency of communication. Technology standardization alone did not increase interpreter use, however standardization along with improved accessibility correlated with an increase in interpreter use. This project was limited by a delay in data of interpretations due to billing processing, and disruption of overall patient census during the COVID19 pandemic.","Barreto Guacaneme, J.; Oliveros, L.; Valdivia, H.; Rakes, L.",Pediatric Critical Care Medicine,572,26

Outside of the medical field there has been a conscious drive to reduce single use plastic and reuse items to reduce the amount of waste we produce. We undertook this investigation to quantify our plastic waste production and generate ideas to reduce this volume. METHODOLOGY: Data was collected from a University Hospital ENT outpatient department via real-time recording methods using standard data collection forms. We measured plastic unit usage pre and post COVID restrictions and compared this to our number of patient encounters. Projections of plastic usage were determined via a hypothetical resumption of patient services model. RESULTS: In total there were 440 patients included. In period one the mean units of plastic used per day was 65.1 (median 67; range 27-84). In the second period, the mean number of plastic units was 23.4 (median 22; range 1-7). Blue nitrile gloves and masks were the most commonly used single use items. The hypothetical projection model predicted a 147.6% increase in single use items following the introduction of COVID precautions. CONCLUSION: We have a duty of care not only to our patients but future generations of patients and the environment which we share. Single use items and excessive plastic wrapping have benefits in terms of convenience and sterility, but these conveniences can be easily extended to reusable types to limit our volume of waste, reduce our waste management costs and protect our environment.","Farrell, Eric; Smyth, David",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,572,18

CASE REPORT: Clinical and radiographic data were obtained from the electronic medical record. Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained and evaluated for COVID-19 by the Food and Drug Administration-approved reverse transcription-PCR assays. On radiographic examination, PET/CT was consistent with COVID-19-related pneumonia not seen on prior imaging. Initial nasopharyngeal swab 2 days after PET/CT imaging was negative for COVID-19. Subsequent repeat swab 10 days later was positive for COVID-19, while the patient was febrile on screening assessment. The patient remained COVID-19-positive until 1 month after abnormal PET/CT imaging. CONCLUSION: PET/CT can be sensitive for early COVID-19 detection, even in the setting of a negative confirmatory PCR test. This highlights the importance of continued patient surveillance and use of appropriate personal protective equipment to minimize COVID-19 transmission.","Mo, Allen; Brodin, N Patrik; Tomé, Wolfgang A; Garg, Madhur K; Kabarriti, Rafi",In Vivo,572,1

Considering the important role of nurses in establishing social justice, identification of factors affecting nurses' participation in this area can contribute to the development of social justice. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify factors affecting nurses' participation in establishing social justice in the health system. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study was conducted using conventional qualitative content analysis approach. Purposive sampling was used to select 14 participants in 2019. The data were collected through semi-structured interviews and analyzed concurrently with data gathering. PARTICIPANTS AND RESEARCH CONTEXT: In total, six faculty members, five nursing managers, and three clinical nurses from three different universities were interviewed. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: The research was approved by the Ethics Committee of Urmia University of Medical Sciences in Iran. FINDINGS: Four main themes were found, including inadequate professional authority, insufficient attention to social justice in the area of education, clinical concerns as barriers to professional presence in society, and reflection of personality traits in the profession. These are the main factors affecting nurses' participation in establishing social justice in the health system. DISCUSSION: Authorities need to take effective steps to establish social justice through reforming the health system's policy-making and power-acquisition domains, promoting nurses' involvement in social factors in health issues, and adding professional values as a part of nursing curriculum. The clinical practice environment can also be helpful through providing quality, safe, and cost-effective services. In addition, fair and efficient recruitment process for new nurses can contribute to the establishment of social justice in the health system. CONCLUSION: Macro-level managerial factors such as policy, education, and clinical environment, along with personal factors, play a significant role in the participation of nursing profession in establishing social justice.","Hosseinzadegan, Fariba; Jasemi, Madineh; Habibzadeh, Hosein",Nurs Ethics,572,20

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impacts of social isolation due to the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals with dementia and their family caregivers. METHODS: Two semi-structured questionnaires were applied via telephone to family caregivers of people diagnosed with dementia in three cities in Argentina, Brazil, and Chile, in order to assess clinical and behavioral changes in people with dementia and in their caregivers. RESULTS: In general, 321 interviews were conducted. A significant decline in memory function has been reported among 53.0%of people with dementia. In addition, 31.2%of individuals with dementia felt sadder and 37.4%had increased anxiety symptoms. These symptoms of anxiety were greater in individuals with mild to moderate dementia, while symptoms of agitation were greater in individuals with severe dementia. Moreover, compulsive-obsessive behavior, hallucinations, increased forgetfulness, altered appetite, and increased difficulty in activities of daily living were reported more frequently among individuals with moderate to severe dementia. Caregivers reported feeling more tired and overwhelmed during this period and these symptoms were also influenced by the severity of dementia. CONCLUSION: Social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic triggered a series of negative behavioral repercussions, both for people with dementia and for their family caregivers in these three South American countries.","Azevedo, Lílian Viana Dos Santos; Calandri, Ismael Luis; Slachevsky, Andrea; Graviotto, Héctor Gastón; Vieira, Maria Carolina Santos; Andrade, Caíssa Bezerra de; Rossetti, Adriana Peredo; Generoso, Alana Barroso; Carmona, Karoline Carvalho; Pinto, Ludmilla Aparecida Cardoso; Sorbara, Marcos; Pinto, Alejandra; Guajardo, Tania; Olavarria, Loreto; Thumala, Daniela; Crivelli, Lucía; Vivas, Ludmila; Allegri, Ricardo Francisco; Barbosa, Maira Tonidandel; Serrano, Cecilia M; Miranda-Castillo, Claudia; Caramelli, Paulo",J Alzheimers Dis,572,16

However, the iterative participatory design process required to produce effective pictograms can be costly in terms of money, time, and effort. Crowdsourcing has been applied to bring down the costs of the participatory design process, but the feasibility of using this approach with older adults remains largely unknown. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the feasibility of using Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), a leading crowdsourcing platform, for participatory pictogram evaluation with older adults (55+) and to evaluate the comprehensibility of USP pictogram, identify common misinterpretations, and explore the relationship between selected participant characteristics and their pictogram comprehension performance. METHODS: 108 older adults (56.5% female; 57-80 years of age) were recruited via MTurk to complete a cross-sectional online survey that asked them to interpret 15 USP pictograms and answer questions about their health and health literacy. RESULTS: It was feasible to perform pictogram evaluation with older adults on MTurk, as shown by ease of recruitment and high data quality. Of the 15 pictograms tested, seven (46.7%) resulted in a comprehensibility score below the threshold established by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), eight (53.3%) elicited common misinterpretations, and two (13.3%) resulted in ANSI-defined ""critical confusion."" Age (P = 0.04) was associated with pictogram comprehension performance. Certain issues with the pictogram subtitles emerged during the evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: MTurk is a feasible platform for participatory pictogram evaluation, even for a sole target of older adults. The USP should develop a pictogram user manual, redesign pictograms confusing to older adults, and establish policies and procedures to ensure that pictogram subtitles conform to evidence-based best practices and standards for patient-centered written drug information.","Lin, Shih-Yin; Thompson, Hilaire J; Hart, Laura A; Fu, Musetta C C; Demiris, George",Res. soc. adm. pharm,572,29

Amongst others, these measures include the temporary restriction of the operation of leisure facilities as well as contact and travel restrictions. These government regulations and recommendations have provoked mixed reactions, with some parts of the population not complying accordingly. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study is to explore reasons for the noncompliance with protective measures on the basis of social media posts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three social networks (Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube comments) were systematically investigated for the period 2 March to 18 April 2020 with regard to attitudes and beliefs about ""social distancing"" and other protective measures by means of qualitative document and content analysis. A total of 119 postings were included in the analysis and interpreted. RESULTS: Six main categories and four subcategories were identified in terms of the rejection of protective measures: misinformation of social media (trivialization and doubts about the effectiveness of protective measures), mistrust of the established public media, knowledge deficits and uncertainty, restriction of basic rights, the role of authorities (population control and poor trust in the Robert Koch Institute), and economic consequences of the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Misinformation in social media and knowledge deficits may contribute to underestimating the pandemic. In addition, economic pressures may contribute to rejecting protective measures. To increase the acceptance of implemented protective measures, health education and transparent and evidence-based communication represent relevant determinants.","Wahidie, Diana; Yilmaz-Aslan, Yüce; Ölcer, Sabahat; Aksakal, Tugba; Brzoska, Patrick",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,572,29

Findings: Of the 59 residents, 57 (96â 6%) tested positive (mean age: 82â 8; women: 66â 7%). Comorbidities were present in all participants, with 18/57 (31â 6%) having three or more concomitant diseases. Delirium-Onset COVID-19 (DOC) was observed in 21/57 (36â 8%) subjects who were chiefly older (mean age: 85â 4 y/o) and with multiple comorbidities. Eleven/21 DOC patients (52â 4%) had hypoactive delirium, while hyperactive delirium occurred in ten/21 (47â 6%). Lymphopenia was present in almost all subjects (median: 1â 3 × 109/L). Overall mortality rate was 24â 6% (14/57) and dementia severity per se had no impact on short-term mortality due to COVID-19. DOC was strongly associated with higher mortality (p<0â 001). Also, DOC and male gender were independently associated with increased risk of mortality (OR: 17â 0, 95% CI: 2â 8-102â 7, p = 0â 002 and 13â 6, 95% CI: 2â 3-79â 2, p = 0â 001 respectively).

In this article, we propose a common pathophysiological denominator for these negative prognostic markers, endogenous, angiotensin II toxicity. We hypothesize that, like in avian influenza, the outlook of COVID-19 is negatively correlated with the intracellular accumulation of angiotensin II promoted by the viral blockade of its degrading enzyme receptors. In this model, upregulated angiotensin II causes premature vascular senescence, leading to dysfunctional coagulation, and immunity. We further hypothesize that angiotensin II blockers and immune checkpoint inhibitors may be salutary for COVID-19 patients with critical illness by reversing both the clotting and immune defects (Graphical Abstract).","Sfera, Adonis; Osorio, Carolina; Jafri, Nyla; Diaz, Eddie Lee; Campo Maldonado, Jose E",Front Immunol,572,29

We aimed to assess blood indices, ECG markers of sudden death and malignant arrhythmias on admission, and diabetes lowering drugs as possible predictors of adverse in-hospital outcome and COVID-19 pneumonia recovery status. METHODS: A retrospective study included patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19 pneumonia from August 20, to October 5, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 192 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were included in the present study, of whom 67 patients had DM. Low lymphocytes % [0.4(0.1-0.9), P = .011] and QTc interval prolongation [0.4(0.1-0.8), P = .022] were associated with increased length of ICU stay. On the other hand, metformin use [0.3(0.2-4), P = .032] and DPP-4 inhibitors use [0.3(0.2-3), P = .040] were associated with decreased length of ICU stay. QTc interval prolongation [0.4(0.1-0.9), P = .017] was associated with increased length of hospital stay, while using metformin [0.4(0.2-3), P = .022] was associated with decreased length of hospital stay. Low lymphocytes % [0.5(0.4-1.6), P = .001], insulin use [0.4(0.3-5), P = .003], and old age [0.5(0.1-2.3), P = .025] were associated with extensive lung injury. The risk for in-hospital death was associated with high neutrophil% [1(1-1.4), P = .045], while metformin use was associated with decreased risk for in-hospital death [0.1(0.1-0.6), P = .025]. Insulin use [0.3(0.2-4), P = .013] was associated with partial recovery following acute COVID pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: Metformin and DPP-4 inhibitors use were associated with favorable in-hospital outcomes, while insulin use was associated with extensive lung injury and post-acute COVID-19 pneumonia partial recovery.","Nafakhi, Hussein; Alareedh, Mohammed; Al-Buthabhak, Karrar; Shaghee, Foaad; Nafakhi, Ahmed; Kasim, Samet",Diabetes Metab Syndr,572,2

Our study investigated the demographic, clinical, laboratory and imaging features of 63 patients with COVID-19 in Beijing. Patients were classified into four groups, mild, moderate, severe and critically ill. The mean age of our patients was 47 years of age (range 3-85) and there was a slight male predominance (58.7%). Thirty percent of our patients had severe or critically ill disease, but only 20% of severe and 33% of critically ill patients had been to Wuhan. Fever was the most common presentation (84.1%), but cough was present in only slightly over half of the patients. We found that lymphocyte and eosinophils count were significantly decreased in patients with severe disease (p = 0.001 and p = 0.000, respectively). Eosinopenia was a feature of higher levels of severity. Peripheral CD4+, CD8+ T lymphocytes, and B lymphocytes were significantly decreased in severe and critically ill patients, but there was only a non-statistically significant downward trend in NK cell numbers with severity. Of note is that liver function tests including AST, ALT, GGT and LDH were elevated, and albumin was decreased. The inflammatory markers CRP, ESR and ferritin were elevated in patients with severe disease or worse. IL-6 levels were also higher, indicating that the presence of a hyperimmune inflammatory state portends higher morbidity and mortality. In a binary logistic regression model, C-reactive protein level (OR 1.073, [CI, 1.013-1.136]; p = 0.017), CD8 T lymphocyte counts (OR 0.989, [CI, 0.979-1.000]; p = 0.043), and D-dimer (OR 5.313, [CI, 0.325-86.816]; p = 0.241) were independent predictors of disease severity.","Sun, Ying; Dong, Yanli; Wang, Lifeng; Xie, Huan; Li, Baosen; Chang, Christopher; Wang, Fu-Sheng",J Autoimmun,572,24

Indeed, most studies thus far have focused on the risk of increase and aggravation of other psychiatric disorders as a consequence of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Yet, risk of onset or aggravation of panic disorder, especially the subtype with prominent respiratory symptoms, which is characterized by a fear response conditioning to interoceptive sensations (e.g., respiratory), and hypervigilance to these interoceptive signals, could be expected in the current situation. Indeed, respiratory symptoms, such as coughs and dyspnea, are among the most commonly associated with the SARS-CoV-2 (59-82% and 31-55%, respectively), and respiratory symptoms are associated with a poor illness prognosis. Hence, given that some etiological and maintenance factors associated with panic disorder - i.e., fear conditioning to abnormal breathing patterns attributable or not to the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), as well as hypervigilance towards breathing abnormalities - are supposedly more prevalent, one could expect an increased risk of panic disorder onset or aggravation following the COVID-19 pandemic in people who were affected by the virus, but also those who were not. In people with the comorbidity (i.e., panic disorder or panic attacks and the COVID-19), it is particularly important to be aware of the risk of hypokalemia in specific at-risk situations or prescriptions. For instance, in the case of salbutamol prescription, which might be overly used in patients with anxiety disorders and COVID-19, or in patients presenting with diarrhea and vomiting. Hypokalemia is associated with an increased risk of torsade de pointe; thus, caution is required when prescribing specific psychotropic drugs, such as the antidepressants citalopram and escitalopram, which are first-line treatments for panic disorder, but also hydroxyzine, aiming at anxiety relief. The results reviewed here highlight the importance of considering and further investigating the impact of the current pandemic on the diagnosis and treatment of panic disorder (alone or comorbid with the COVID-19).","Javelot, H; Weiner, L",Encephale,572,20

Favipiravir is a repurposed antiviral agent in treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to meet the current need, pharmaceutical companies are working for manufacturing licensed generic favipiravir. For getting the marketing authorization, the bioequivalence of the generic product must be proven first. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the bioequivalence of a new favipiravir tablet formulation as compared to the reference tablet formulation in healthy male subjects under fasting conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To prove the bioequivalence, a randomized, single oral dose, cross-over, two-period study was carried out in 30 healthy subjects under fasting conditions. Plasma favipiravir levels were quantified by using an in-house-developed high performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry detector (LC-MSD) method.

After one year of the pandemic, the initial evidence on health system responses begins to consolidate, and there is a need to identify and synthesise experiences of responding to COVID-19 among healthcare professionals and other health system stakeholders. This systematic review of primary qualitative studies depicts the experiences and perceptions of organisations and actors at multiple levels of health systems internationally in responding to COVID-19. METHODS: Six main databases of biomedical information, public health and health administration research were searched over the period October 1, 2019, to October 21, 2020. Information extracted from included studies was analysed thematically. RESULTS: Thirty-four studies were eligible for data extraction. Nine of those studies, of lower methodological quality, were removed from the thematic analysis of study results. Considering the professional level experiences, predominant themes of the studies consisted of the new roles and responsibilities of healthcare workers, burnout and distress, recognition of ´unseen´ healthcare workers, and positive changes and emergent solutions amid the crisis. Organisational level findings of the studies included provision of psychological support, COVID-19 as ""catalyst"" for change, and exercise of more ""open"" leadership by managers and health authorities. Continuous training, regulation of working conditions, providing supportive resources, coordinating a diversity of actors, and reviewing and updating regulations were roles identified at the local health system level. CONCLUSIONS: The experiences of frontline healthcare workers have been the focus of attention of the majority of primary qualitative studies as of October 2020. However, organisational and wider system level studies indicate that some responses to COVID-19 have been characterised by increased emphasis on coordination activities by local health system actors, making service adaptations at pace, and reliance on expanded roles of front-line workers. The need for theory-informed qualitative studies was identified at the organisational level.

Recent data suggests an increased risk for personnel of gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy units for SARS-CoV-2 infections. Several societies have provided recommendations for the current situation, but their feasibility is unclear and real-world data on preparedness of endoscopy units are lacking. AIMS & METHODS: A web-based survey among German GI-endoscopy heads was conducted from April 1 to April 7, 2020. It comprised 33 questions based on the ESGE (European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy) recommendations and was distributed electronically by the German Society of Gastroenterology, Digestive and Metabolic Diseases (DGVS). RESULTS: Of 551 completed surveys, 202 (37â%) endoscopy units cancelled less than 40â% of their procedures. Small-volume units (<â4000 procedures/year) cancelled significantly less procedures than high-volume units (>â4000). Complete spatial separation of high-risk patients was possible in only 17â%. Most units systematically identified patients at risk (91â%) and used risk adapted personal protective equipment (PPE, 85â%). For the future, shortages in PPE (83â%), staff (69â%) and relevant financial losses (80â%) were expected. CONCLUSIONS: Recommendations on structural measures were only partially fulfilled and cancellations of procedures were heterogeneous. Clear definitions of indications to perform endoscopies during such a pandemic are needed. Further, structural recommendations should be adapted and strategies to compensate financial losses need to be developed.","Damm, Marko; Garbe, Jakob; Eisenmann, Stephan; Heidemann, Clara; Krug, Sebastian; Walter, Steffen; Lammert, Frank; Michl, Patrick; Rosendahl, Jonas",Z. gastroenterol,572,23

False news, conspiracy theories, and magical cures were shared with the general public at an alarming rate, which may lead to increased anxiety and stress levels and associated debilitating consequences. OBJECTIVES: To measure the level of COVID-19 information overload (COVIO) and assess the association between COVIO and sociodemographic characteristics among the general public. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted between April and May 2020 using a modified Cancer Information Overload scale. The survey was developed and posted on four social media platforms. The data were only collected from those who consented to participate. COVIO score was classified into high vs. low using the asymmetrical distribution as a guide and conducted a binary logistic regression to examine the factors associated with COVIO. RESULTS: A total number of 584 respondents participated in this study. The mean COVIO score of the respondents was 19.4 (± 4.0). Sources and frequency of receiving COVID-19 information were found to be significant predictors of COVIO. Participants who received information via the broadcast media were more likely to have high COVIO than those who received information via the social media (adjusted odds ratio ([aOR],14.599; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.608-132.559; p = 0.017). Also, participants who received COVID-19 information every minute (aOR, 3.892; 95% CI, 1.124-13.480; p = 0.032) were more likely to have high COVIO than those who received information every week. CONCLUSION: The source of information and the frequency of receiving COVID-19 information were significantly associated with COVIO. The COVID-19 information is often conflicting, leading to confusion and overload of information in the general population. This can have unfavorable effects on the measures taken to control the transmission and management of COVID-19 infection.","Mohammed, Mustapha; Sha039,; aban, Abubakar; Jatau, Abubakar Ibrahim; Yunusa, Ismaeel; Isa, Abubakar Musa; Wada, Abubakar Sadiq; Obamiro, Kehinde; Zainal, Hadzliana; Ibrahim, Baharudin",J. racial ethnic health disparities (Internet),572,20

Now that the vaccine is available to priority populations, it is critical to convince those that are hesitant to take the vaccine. Public health communication about the vaccine as well as misinformation on the vaccine occurs through a variety of different information channels. Some channels of information are more commonly found to spread misinformation. Given the expansive information environment, we sought to characterize the use of different media channels for COVID-19 vaccine information and determine the relationship between information channel and vaccine acceptance. We used quota sampling of vaccine priority groups [N = 2,650] between December 13 and 23, 2020 and conducted bivariate chi-squared tests and multivariable multinomial logistic regression analyses to determine the relative impact of channels of information on vaccine acceptance. We found traditional channels of information, especially National TV, National newspapers, and local newspapers increased the likelihood of vaccine acceptance. Individuals who received information from traditional media compared to social media or both traditional and social media were most likely to accept the vaccine. The implications of this study suggest social media channels have a role to play in educating the hesitant to accept the vaccine, while traditional media channels should continue to promote data-driven and informed vaccine content to their viewers.","Piltch-Loeb, Rachael; Savoia, Elena; Goldberg, Beth; Hughes, Brian; Verhey, Tanner; Kayyem, Juliette; Miller-Idriss, Cynthia; Testa, Marcia",PLoS One,572,21

It is unknown whether peripheral immunity is related to cognitive dysfunction in ALS patients. OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between the peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets and the cognitive status in ALS patients. METHODS: Among 81 ALS patients, we compared the demographic, clinical, and peripheral levels of total T lymphocyte, CD4+ T lymphocyte, CD8+ T lymphocyte, B lymphocyte, and NK cell between those with cognitive impairment (ALS-ci) and those without (ALS-nci). The cognitive status was evaluated via the Chinese version of the Edinburgh cognitive and behavioral screen (ECAS). Significant predictors of cognitive impairment in univariate logistic regression analysis were further examined using multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: 39.5% of all ALS patients had cognitive impairment. The ALS-ci group had shorter education time, older age at both symptom onset and testing, longer disease duration, and lower levels of peripheral total, CD4+, and CD8+ T lymphocyte and B lymphocyte than the ALS-nci group. Frequency of behavioral impairment did not differ between the two groups. While parameters with significant differences identified by group comparison were also significant predictors of cognitive impairment in univariate logistic regression analysis except the level of B lymphocyte, only older age at testing, education time less than 9 years, and lower level of CD4+ T lymphocyte remained significant in multivariate logistic regression analysis. The predictive model combining these three parameters had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value of 0.842 with a sensitivity of 90.6% and a specificity of 67.3%. CONCLUSION: In Chinese ALS patients, blood CD4+ T lymphocyte might help evaluate cognitive impairment along with age and education level.","Yang, Yuan; Pan, Dengji; Gong, Zhenxiang; Tang, Jiahui; Li, Zehui; Ding, Fengfei; Liu, Mao; Zhang, Min",BMC Neurol,572,1

Comparison with the H-passivated Si nanocrystal shows that the bromine coating, despite having less electronegativity, affects the electronic structure and transition rates more than the chlorine one due to the stronger structural perturbations caused by the greater surface atoms. Certain electron-hole asymmetry in both of the considered multi-carrier processes is revealed for the Br-coated silicon nanocrystal: the processes become faster if initiated by holes and slower (or invariable on the whole) if initiated by electrons.

We sought to shed further light on this issue by conducting a single-center study in a kidney transplant center located in one of the France's highest risk zone (Grand Est) for Covid-19 during the initial disease outbreak. METHOD: To this aim, we used a survey approach coupled with systematic investigation of SARS-CoV-2 serology in a cohort of 1390 KTR. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 serologies were available for 780 survey respondents, among whom 48 had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (total seroprevalence: 6.2%). Thirty-five of the 48 seropositive KTR had previously received a diagnosis of Covid-19, whereas the remaining 13 patients were not known to be infected (8 asymptomatic cases). Specifically, 18.7% of seropositive KTR and 1.1% of the entire cohort were asymptomatic. Household exposure was found to markedly increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that the overall SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in KTR living in one of the France's highest risk zone for Covid-19 during the first French lockdown was as low as 6.3%.

But, throughout the world, many citizens don't understand well how these measures are taken and even question the decisions taken by their government. Should the measures be more (or less) restrictive? Are they taken for a too long (or too short) period of time? To provide some quantitative elements of response to these questions, we consider the well-known SEIR model for the Covid-19 epidemic propagation and propose a pragmatic model of the government decision-making operation. Although simple and obviously improvable, the proposed model allows us to study the tradeoff between health and economic aspects in a pragmatic and insightful way. Assuming a given number of phases for the epidemic (namely, 4 in this paper) and a desired tradeoff between health and economic aspects, it is then possible to determine the optimal duration of each phase and the optimal severity level (i.e., the target transmission rate) for each of them. The numerical analysis is performed for the case of France but the adopted approach can be applied to any country. One of the takeaway messages of this analysis is that being able to implement the optimal 4-phase epidemic management strategy in France would have led to 1.05 million of infected people and a GDP loss of 231 billions  instead of 6.88 millions of infected and a loss of 241 billions . This indicates that, seen from the proposed model perspective, the effectively implemented epidemic management strategy is good economically, whereas substantial improvements might have been obtained in terms of health impact. Our analysis indicates that the lockdown/severe phase should have been more severe but shorter, and the adjustment phase occurred earlier. Due to the natural tendency of people to deviate from the official rules, updating measures every month over the whole epidemic episode seems to be more appropriate.","Lasaulce, Samson; Zhang, Chao; Varma, Vineeth; Morarescu, Irinel Constantin",Front Public Health,572,26

Thus, Hong Kong is a model case for the population-wide practice of effective social distancing and provides an opportunity to examine the impact of loneliness on mental health during the COVID-19. We conducted an anonymous online survey of 432 residents in Hong Kong to examine psychological distress in the community. The results indicate a dire situation with respect to mental health. An astonishing 65.6% (95% C.I. = [60.6%, 70.4%]) of the respondents reported clinical levels of depression, anxiety, and/or stress.

Apart from its anti-parasitic effect it also exhibits antiviral activity against a number of viruses both in vitro and in vivo. Hence, we conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the currently available data on the therapeutic potential of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 as add on therapy. A total of 629 patients were included in the 4 studies and all were COVID-19 RT-PCR positive. Among them, 397 patients received ivermectin along with usual therapy. The random effect model showed the overall pooled OR to be 0.53 (95%CI: 0.29 to0.96) for the primary outcome (all-cause mortality) which was statistically significant (P=0.04). Similarly, the random effect model revealed that adding ivermectin led to significant clinical improvement compared to usual therapy (OR=1.98, 95% CI: 1.11 to 3.53, P=0.02). However, this should be inferred cautiously as the quality of evidence is very low.

SARS-CoV-2 causes severe inflammation, which can be fatal. Consequently, there has been a massive and rapid growth in research aimed at throwing light on the mechanisms of infection and the progression of the disease. With regard to this data science is playing a pivotal role in in silico analysis to gain insights into SARS-CoV-2 and the outbreak of COVID-19 in order to forecast, diagnose and come up with a drug to tackle the virus. The availability of large multiomics, radiological, bio-molecular and medical datasets requires the development of novel exploratory and predictive models, or the customisation of existing ones in order to fit the current problem. The high number of approaches generates the need for surveys to guide data scientists and medical practitioners in selecting the right tools to manage their clinical data. RESULTS: Focusing on data science methodologies, we conduct a detailed study on the state-of-the-art of works tackling the current pandemic scenario. We consider various current COVID-19 data analytic domains such as phylogenetic analysis, SARS-CoV-2 genome identification, protein structure prediction, host-viral protein interactomics, clinical imaging, epidemiological research and drug discovery. We highlight data types and instances, their generation pipelines and the data science models currently in use. The current study should give a detailed sketch of the road map towards handling COVID-19 like situations by leveraging data science experts in choosing the right tools.

The purpose of this study is to review a multi-institutional clinical experience in 100 consecutive patients, at 20 hospitals, with confirmed COVID-19 supported with ECMO. This analysis includes our first 100 patients with complete data who had confirmed COVID-19 and were supported with ECMO. The first patient in the cohort was placed on ECMO on March 17, 2020. Differences by the mortality group were assessed using &#967;2 tests for categorical variables and Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum tests and Welch's analysis of variance for continuous variables. The median time on ECMO was 12.0 days (IQR = 8-22 days). All 100 patients have since been separated from ECMO: 50 patients survived and 50 patients died. The rate of survival with veno-venous ECMO was 49 of 96 patients (51%), whereas that with veno-arterial ECMO was 1 of 4 patients (25%). Of 50 survivors, 49 have been discharged from the hospital and 1 remains hospitalized at the ECMO-providing hospital. Survivors were generally younger, with a lower median age (47 versus 56.5 years, p = 0.014). In the 50 surviving patients, adjunctive therapies while on ECMO included intravenous steroids (26), anti-interleukin-6 receptor blockers (26), convalescent plasma (22), remdesivir (21), hydroxychloroquine (20), and prostaglandin (15). Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may facilitate salvage and survival of selected critically ill patients with COVID-19. Survivors tend to be younger. Substantial variation exists in the drug treatment of COVID-19, but ECMO offers a reasonable rescue strategy.","Jacobs, Jeffrey P; Stammers, Alfred H; Louis, James St; Hayanga, J W Awori; Firstenberg, Michael S; Mongero, Linda B; Tesdahl, Eric A; Rajagopal, Keshava; Cheema, Faisal H; Patel, Kirti; Esseghir, Feriel; Coley, Tom; Sestokas, Anthony K; Slepian, Marvin J; Badhwar, Vinay",ASAIO J,572,1

It has been suggested that these shock fronts may increase the spread of COVID-19 by propelling respiratory particles containing the SARS-CoV-2 virus several meters due to particle entrainment in the low pressure area behind the shocks. To determine the likelihood of this occurring, fluorescent particles, ranging in size from 10-50 µm, were dropped into the shock regions produced by a trombone, a trumpet, and a shock tube. Preliminary results indicate that propagation of small airborne particles by the shock fronts radiating from brass wind instruments is unlikely.","Moore, Thomas R; Cannaday, Ashley E",J Acoust Soc Am,572,24

Amidst this global crisis, various controversies have been emerging about how to manage the virus, ranging from whether face masks should be required as a preventive measure to whether hydroxychloroquine is an appropriate treatment. There has been a barrage of contradictory claims related to these issues. However, in many cases, it is not possible for an individual to wait until consensus is reached before deciding on a course of action. Meanwhile, to avoid misplacing trust, trust must be well grounded. Conventional school science largely focuses on the trustworthiness of data and evidence, rather than that of the people making scientific claims. This failure to consider the human factor renders conventional school science inadequate for helping students make informed judgements about granting trust. Drawing on the literature in epistemic practice, this paper highlights four epistemic processes potentially useful for students to ground their trust, including (1) identifying whether recognition from peer reviewers has been obtained; (2) examining the credentials of those who claim expertise; (3) determining the level of expert consensus; and (4) identifying possible sources of bias. Through critical reflection on events related to the Covid-19 pandemic as examples, this paper examines how these epistemic processes inform judgement about the trustworthiness of people in terms of their competence and motives. The discussion highlights the need to develop students' capacity to identify expertise/ credentials, the nature of journals and of organisations when trust is assigned. This paper offers a frame for science educators on guiding students to place trust as a part of their decision-making process. The capability would be relevant to contexts beyond the Covid-19 pandemic.","Leung, Jessica S C; Cheng, Maurice M W",Cult Stud Sci Educ,572,16

As it is often difficult to accurately date the acquisition of magnetic information recorded in archaeological materials, large age uncertainties and discrepancies are common in archaeomagnetic datasets, limiting the ability to use these data for geomagnetic modeling and archaeomagnetic dating. Here we present an accurately dated reconstruction of the intensity and direction of the field in Jerusalem in August, 586 BCE, the date of the city's destruction by fire by the Babylonian army, which marks the end of the Iron Age in the Levant. We analyzed 54 floor segments, of unprecedented construction quality, unearthed within a large monumental structure that had served as an elite or public building and collapsed during the conflagration. From the reconstructed paleomagnetic directions, we conclude that the tilted floor segments had originally been part of the floor of the second story of the building and cooled after they had collapsed. This firmly connects the time of the magnetic acquisition to the date of the destruction. The relatively high field intensity, corresponding to virtual axial dipole moment (VADM) of 148.9 ± 3.9 ZAm2, accompanied by a geocentric axial dipole (GAD) inclination and a positive declination of 8.3°, suggests instability of the field during the 6th century BCE and redefines the duration of the Levantine Iron Age Anomaly. The narrow dating of the geomagnetic reconstruction enabled us to constrain the age of other Iron Age finds and resolve a long archaeological and historical discussion regarding the role and dating of royal Judean stamped jar handles. This demonstrates how archaeomagnetic data derived from historically-dated destructions can serve as an anchor for archaeomagnetic dating and its particular potency for periods in which radiocarbon is not adequate for high resolution dating.","Vaknin, Yoav; Shaar, Ron; Gadot, Yuval; Shalev, Yiftah; Lipschits, Oded; Ben-Yosef, Erez",PLoS One,572,15

When the donning process has moisture introduced, however, complications can arise, which consumes vital time. Most commonly, gloves undergo a chlorination treatment to reduce glove tack, allowing easier donning. To assess the effects of different chlorination strengths and glove thicknesses on donning, acrylonitrile butadiene gloves were manufactured at two different thicknesses (0.05 and 0.10 mm) with 4 different chlorination treatments: 0, 500, 1000 and 2000 ppm. Six participants were used to assess the time taken to don each of the glove sets with dry and wet hands (16 tests in total). Overall, the thicker gloves took longer to don, due to differences in the material stiffness hindering the donning process. The quickest performance from the chlorinated gloves was noted in the 1000 and 2000 ppm concentrations. Wet conditions also showed significant increases in the donning time.Practitioners Summary: The study was conducted based on the gaps identified in previous literature reviews which revealed the requirement for a greater understanding of glove donning process. It was found a stronger chlorination was detrimental when the hands were wet, but better when dry. Thicker gloves were also found to be detrimental.

Swine testis cells with Na+/K+-ATPase &#945;1 knocked down exhibited decreased susceptibility to TGEV infectivity and attenuated PI3K_PDK1_RSK2 signaling. Herein, we further explored a Na+/K+-ATPase-independent signaling axis induced by natural cardenolides that also afforded significant anti-coronaviral activity for porcine TGEV and human HCoV-OC43. Using pharmacological inhibition and gene silencing techniques, we found that this anti-TGEV or anti-HCoV-OC43 activity was caused by JAK1 proteolysis and mediated through upstream activation of Ndfip1/2 and its effector NEDD4.

In absence of official recommendations, implementing daily multidisciplinary team (MDT) COVID-19 meetings was urgently needed. Our aim was to describe our initial institutional standard operating procedures for implementing these meetings, and their impact on daily practice. METHODS: All consecutive patients who were hospitalized in our institution due to COVID 19, from March 31 to April 15, 2020, were included. Criteria to be presented at MDT meetings were defined as a proven COVID-19 by PCR or strongly suspected on CT scan, requiring hospitalization and treatment not included in the standard of care. Three investigators identified the patients who met the predefined criteria and compared the treatment and outcomes of patients with predefined criteria that were presented during MDT meeting with those not presented during MDT meeting. COVID-19 MDT meeting implementation and adhesion were also assessed by a hospital medical staff survey. RESULTS: In all, 318 patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 were examined in our hospital. Of these, 230 (87%) were hospitalized in a COVID-19 unit, 91 (40%) of whom met predefined MDT meeting criteria. Fifty (55%) patients were presented at a MDT meeting versus 41 (45%) were not.

It has undergone an evolutionary process from live attenuated pathogen vaccine to killed whole organisms or inactivated toxins (toxoids), each of them having its own advantages and disadvantages. The crucial parameters in vaccination are the generation of memory response and protection against infection, while an important aspect is the effective delivery of antigen in an intelligent manner to evoke a robust immune response. In this regard, nanotechnology is greatly contributing to developing efficient vaccine adjuvants and delivery systems. These can protect the encapsulated antigen from the host's in-vivo environment and releasing it in a sustained manner to induce a long-lasting immunostimulatory effect. In view of this, the present review article summarizes nanoscale-based adjuvants and delivery vehicles such as viral vectors, virus-like particles and virosomes; non-viral vectors namely nanoemulsions, lipid nanocarriers, biodegradable and non-degradable nanoparticles, calcium phosphate nanoparticles, colloidally stable nanoparticles, proteosomes; and pattern recognition receptors covering c-type lectin receptors and toll-like receptors.","Petkar, Kailash C; Patil, Suyash M; Chavhan, Sandip S; Kaneko, Kan; Sawant, Krutika K; Kunda, Nitesh K; Saleem, Imran Y",,572,16

Thus, we performed a meta-analysis of published liver manifestations and described the liver damage in patients with COVID-19 who died or discharged alive. Approach & Results: We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, medRxiv, bioRxiv, the Cochrane Library, Embase, and three Chinese electronic databases through April 22, 2020. We analyzed pooled data on liver chemistries stratified by the main clinical outcome of COVID-19, using a fixed or random-effects model. In our meta-analysis of 19 studies, which included a total of 4,103 patients, the pooled mean alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels were respectively 31.7 and 51.0 IU/L in the patients with COVID-19 who died and 27.7 and 32.9 IU/L in those discharged alive (both p < 0.0001). Compared with the patients discharged alive, those who died tended to have lower albumin levels but longer prothrombin time and higher international standardized ratio. Conclusions: In this meta-analysis, according to the main clinical outcome of COVID-19, we comprehensively described three patterns of liver impairment related to COVID-19, hepatocellular injury, cholestasis, and hepatocellular disfunction. The patients who died from COVID-19 tended to have different liver chemistries from those discharged alive. Special caution should be given to the patients with relatively higher index of liver chemistries.","Xing, Qing-Qing; Dong, Xuan; Ren, Yan-Dan; Chen, Wei-Ming; Zeng, Dan-Yi; Cai, Yan-Yan; Hong, Mei-Zhu; Pan, Jin-Shui",,572,32

We will provide examples of how commercial PM analyzers of different principles have been compared and calibrated for specific applications under different climate conditions of specific geographic locations. For bioaerosols, having more complex biological and biochemical identity, we will start from air sampling techniques, followed by a discussion of various detection methods (plate culture, molecular methods, immunoassays and biosensors) in association with compatible sampling technologies.

Within a year, a few COVID-19 vaccines have been developed and authorized. This unparalleled initiative in developing vaccines created many uncertainties looming around the efficacy and safety of these vaccines. This study aimed to assess the side effects and perceptions following COVID-19 vaccination in Jordan. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted by distributing an online survey targeted toward Jordan inhabitants who received any COVID-19 vaccines. Data were statistically analyzed and certain machine learning (ML) tools, including multilayer perceptron (MLP), eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF), and K-star were used to predict the severity of side effects. Results: A total of 2213 participants were involved in the study after receiving Sinopharm, AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, and other vaccines (38.2%, 31%, 27.3%, and 3.5%, respectively). Generally, most of the post-vaccination side effects were common and non-life-threatening (e.g., fatigue, chills, dizziness, fever, headache, joint pain, and myalgia). Only 10% of participants suffered from severe side effects;while 39% and 21% of participants had moderate and mild side effects, respectively. Despite the substantial variations between these vaccines in the presence and severity of side effects, the statistical analysis indicated that these vaccines might provide the same protection against COVID-19 infection. Finally, around 52.9% of participants suffered before vaccination from vaccine hesitancy and anxiety;while after vaccination, 95.5% of participants have advised others to get vaccinated, 80% felt more reassured, and 67% believed that COVID-19 vaccines are safe in the long term. Furthermore, based on the type of vaccine, demographic data, and side effects, the RF, XGBoost, and MLP gave both high accuracies (0.80, 0.79, and 0.70, respectively) and Cohen’s kappa values (0.71, 0.70, and 0.56, respectively). Conclusions: The present study confirmed that the authorized COVID-19 vaccines are safe and getting vaccinated makes people more reassured. Most of the post-vaccination side effects are mild to moderate, which are signs that body’s immune system is building protection. ML can also be used to predict the severity of side effects based on the input data;predicted severe cases may require more medical attention or even hospitalization.","Hatmal, Ma’mon M.; Al-Hatamleh, Mohammad A.

Its papain-like protease (SARS-CoV-2 PLpro) is a crucial target to halt virus replication. SARS-CoV PLpro and SARS-CoV-2 PLpro share an 82.9% sequence identity and a 100% sequence identity for the binding site reported to accommodate small molecules in SARS-CoV. The flexible key binding site residues Tyr269 and Gln270 for small-molecule recognition in SARS-CoV PLpro exist also in SARS-CoV-2 PLpro. This inspired us to use the reported small-molecule binders to SARS-CoV PLpro to generate a high-quality DEKOIS 2.0 benchmark set. Accordingly, we used them in a cross-benchmarking study against SARS-CoV-2 PLpro. As there is no SARS-CoV-2 PLpro structure complexed with a small-molecule ligand publicly available at the time of manuscript submission, we built a homology model based on the ligand-bound SARS-CoV structure for benchmarking and docking purposes. Three publicly available docking tools FRED, AutoDock Vina, and PLANTS were benchmarked. All showed better-than-random performances, with FRED performing best against the built model. Detailed performance analysis via pROC-Chemotype plots showed a strong enrichment of the most potent bioactives in the early docking ranks. Cross-benchmarking against the X-ray structure complexed with a peptide-like inhibitor confirmed that FRED is the best-performing tool. Furthermore, we performed cross-benchmarking against the newly introduced X-ray structure complexed with a small-molecule ligand. Interestingly, its benchmarking profile and chemotype enrichment were comparable to the built model. Accordingly, we used FRED in a prospective virtual screen of the DrugBank database. In conclusion, this study provides an example of how to harness a custom-made DEKOIS 2.0 benchmark set as an approach to enhance the virtual screening success rate against a vital target of the rapidly emerging pandemic.","Ibrahim, Tamer M; Ismail, Muhammad I; Bauer, Matthias R; Bekhit, Adnan A; Boeckler, Frank M",Front Chem,572,16

SETTING: Province of Granada (Spain). POPULATION: COVID-19 patients hospitalized, admitted to ICU, recovered and died from March 15 to September 22, 2020. STUDY VARIABLES: The number of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and hospitalized or admitted to ICU for COVID-19. RESULTS: The data reported by hospitals was used to develop a mathematical model that reflects the flow of the population among the different interest groups in relation to COVID-19. This tool allows to analyse different scenarios based on socio-health restriction measures, and to forecast the number of people infected, hospitalized and admitted to the ICU. CONCLUSIONS: The mathematical model is capable of providing predictions on the evolution of the COVID-19 sufficiently in advance as to anticipate the peaks of prevalence and hospital and ICU care demands, and also the appearance of periods in which the care for non-COVID patients could be intensified.","Garrido, J.

We adapt the naive Bayes classifier from the machine learning community for use on atom-to-atom pairwise contacts. The result is an unsupervised learning algorithm that samples a `distribution' over potential classification schemes. We apply the classifier to a series of test structures and one real protein, showing that it identifies the conformational transition with>95% accuracy in most cases. A nontrivial feature of our adaptation is a new connection to information entropy that allows us to vary the level of structural detail without spoiling the categorization. This is confirmed by comparing results as the number of atoms and time-samples are varied over 1.5 orders of magnitude. Further, the method's derivation from Bayesian analysis on the set of inter-atomic contacts makes it easy to understand and extend to more complex cases.","Rogers, David M.",,572,16

Furthermore, people's ability to understand health information varies and depends on their skills in reading and interpreting information. This study aims to evaluate the readability and creditability of websites with COVID-19-related information. Methods: The search terms ""coronavirus,"" ""COVID,"" and ""COVID-19"" were input into Google. The websites of the first thirty results for each search term were evaluated in terms of their credibility and readability using the Health On the Net Foundation code of conduct (HONcode) and Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL), Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG), Gunning Fog, and Flesch Reading Ease Score (FRE) scales, respectively. Results: The readability of COVID-19-related health information on websites was suitable for high school graduates or college students and, thus, was far above the recommended readability level. Most websites that were examined (87.2%) had not been officially certified by HONcode. There was no significant difference in the readability scores of websites with and without HONcode certification. Conclusion: These results suggest that organizations should improve the readability of their websites and provide information that more people can understand.

Here we identify a novel extended COPI binding motif in the spike that encompasses the canonical K-x-H dibasic sequence. This motif demonstrates selectivity for COPI subunit. Guided by an in silico analysis of dibasic motifs in the human proteome, we employ mutagenesis and binding assays to show that the spike motif terminal residues are critical modulators of complex dissociation, which is essential for spike release in ERGIC. COPI residues critical for spike motif binding are elucidated by mutagenesis and crystallography and found to be conserved in the zoonotic reservoirs, bats, pangolins, camels, and in humans. Collectively, our investigation on the spike motif identifies key COPI binding determinants with implications for retrograde trafficking.","Dey, Debajit; Singh, Suruchi; Khan, Saif; Martin, Matthew; Schnicker, Nicholas; Gakhar, Lokesh; Pierce, Brian; Hasan, S Saif",,572,1

Design Living rapid review of observational and experimental studies with random-effects hierarchical Bayesian meta-analyses. Published articles and pre-prints were identified via MEDLINE and medRxiv. Setting Community or hospital, no restrictions on location. Participants Adults who received a SARS-CoV-2 test or a COVID-19 diagnosis. Measurements Outcomes were SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, disease severity and mortality stratified by smoking status. Study quality was assessed (i.e. 'good', 'fair' and 'poor'). Findings Version 7 (searches up to 25 August 2020) included 233 studies with 32 'good' and 'fair' quality studies included in meta-analyses. Fifty-seven studies (24.5%) reported current, former and never smoking status. Recorded smoking prevalence among people with COVID-19 was generally lower than national prevalence. Current compared with never smokers were at reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection [relative risk (RR) = 0.74, 95% credible interval (CrI) = 0.58-0.93, tau = 0.41]. Data for former smokers were inconclusive (RR = 1.05, 95% CrI = 0.95-1.17, tau = 0.17), but favoured there being no important association (21% probability of RR &gt;= 1.1). Former compared with never smokers were at somewhat increased risk of hospitalization (RR = 1.20, CrI = 1.03-1.44, tau = 0.17), greater disease severity (RR = 1.52, CrI = 1.13-2.07, tau = 0.29) and mortality (RR = 1.39, 95% CrI = 1.09-1.87, tau = 0.27). Data for current smokers were inconclusive (RR = 1.06, CrI = 0.82-1.35, tau = 0.27;RR = 1.25, CrI = 0.85-1.93, tau = 0.34;RR = 1.22, 95% CrI = 0.78-1.94, tau = 0.49, respectively), but favoured there being no important associations with hospitalization and mortality (35% and 70% probability of RR &gt;= 1.1, respectively) and a small but important association with disease severity (79% probability of RR &gt;= 1.1). Conclusions Compared with never smokers, current smokers appear to be at reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, while former smokers appear to be at increased risk of hospitalization, increased disease severity and mortality from COVID-19. However, it is uncertain whether these associations are causal. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)","Simons, David Shahab Lion Brown Jamie Perski Olga",Addiction,572,16

Inefficient viral clearance at any stage is a hallmark of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Disease severity is associated with increases in peripheral blood cytokines among which interleukin 10 (IL-10) increases particularly early and independent of patient age, which is not seen in active SARS-CoV infection. Here, we consider the known multi-faceted immune regulatory role of IL-10, both in protecting the lung from injury and in defense against infections, as well as its potential cellular source. While the absence of an IL-10 response in SARS is thought to contribute to early deterioration, we suspect IL-10 to protect the lung from early immune-mediated damage and to interfere with viral clearance in COVID-19. This may further both viral spread and poor outcome in many high-risk patients. Identifying the features of the viral genotype, which specifically underlie the different IL-10 dynamics as an etiological endotype and the different viral load kinetics and outcomes as clinical phenotype, may unveil a new immune evasive strategy of SARS-CoV-2.","Lindner, Holger A; Velásquez, Sonia Y; Thiel, Manfred; Kirschning, Thomas",Front Immunol,572,2

Multiple logistic regression was used to assess the association of ABO blood group types with three primary outcomes: major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), major arterial and venous thrombosis and all-cause mortality. 201, 121, 61 and 26 individuals had blood group O, A, B and AB, respectively. In multivariable analysis, blood group A was associated with a 2.5-fold higher odds of MACE than blood group O (OR 2.47[1.18-5.18]). There was an effect suggesting a 2-fold higher odds of major thrombotic events in blood group A vs. O that did not reach statistical significance (OR 2.15 [0.89-5.20]). No association between blood group type and all-cause mortality was found. Compared with the other blood group types, blood group A was associated with an increased odds of MACE(ORA/non-A 2.18[1.11-4.29]), while blood group O was associated with lower odds of MACE(ORO/non-O 0.50[0.26-0.97]). In conclusion, blood group A was associated with an increased odds of MACE, whereas blood group O was associated with a reduction in the odds of MACE in patients with COVID-19. These findings may inform risk stratification of COVID-19 patients for cardiovascular complications.

The long-term psychological impact, of both the spread of the virus and the restrictive policies adopted to counteract it, remains uncertain. However, recent studies reported a high level of psychological distress and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms. The purpose of this study is to assess the psychometric properties of a new questionnaire, to evaluate PTSD risk related to the COVID-19 emergency. A total of Italian people completed a web-based cross-sectional survey broadcasted through different social-media. Demographic data and some psychological dimensions, such as general distress and sleep disturbance, were collected. A new self-report questionnaire (COVID-19-PTSD), consisting of 19 items, was developed starting from the PTSD Check List for DSM-5 (PCL-5) questionnaire, and it was administered in order to analyze its psychometric properties. The results highlighted the adequate psychometric properties of the COVID-19-PTSD questionnaire. The confirmatory factor analysis indicated that a seven-factor model (Intrusion, Avoidance, Negative Affect, Anhedonia, Dysphoric arousal, Anxious arousal and Externalizing behavior) best fits the data. Significant correlations were found among COVID-19-PTSD scores, general distress and sleep disturbance. A high percentage of PTSD symptomatology (29.5%) was found in the Italian population. COVID-19-PTSD appears to be effective in evaluating the specific stress symptoms related to the COVID-19 pandemic in the Italian population. These results are relevant from a clinical point of view because they suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic could be considered as a traumatic event. Psychological interventions to counteract short- and long-term psychopathological effects, consequent to the COVID-19 pandemic, appear to be necessary.","Forte, Giuseppe; Favieri, Francesca; Tambelli, Renata; Casagrande, Maria",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),572,24

This study examines the influence of resilience on the impact of COVID-related stress and enforced lockdown on mental health, drug use and treatment adherence among people living with HIV (PLWH) in Argentina. SETTING: PLWH residing predominantly in Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area and urban regions of Argentina were identified from a private clinic electronic database. METHODS: Participants completed an anonymous online survey to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on economic disruption, resilience, mental health outcomes (depression, anxiety, stress, loneliness), adherence to HIV treatment, and substance use. We performed ordinary least squares and logistic regressions to test whether resilient coping buffered the impact of economic disruption on mental health and drug use during quarantine. RESULTS: 1336 PLWH aged 18-82 were enrolled. The impact of economic disruption on mental health &#916;F(1,1321)=8.86, p=.003 and loneliness &#916;F(1,1326)=5.77, p=.016 was buffered by resilience. A three-way interaction between resilient buffering, stress, and sex was significant &#916;F(1,1325)=4.76, p=.029. Participants reported less than excellent adherence to medication (33%), disruption to mental health services (11%), and disruption to substance abuse treatment (1.3%) during lockdown. DISCUSSION: The impact of COVID-stress and lockdown on emotional distress appeared mitigated by resilience coping strategies and the buffering impact of resilience on perceived stress was greater among women. Results highlight PLWH's capacity to adhere to treatment in challenging circumstances and the importance of developing resilience skills for better coping with stress and adversity.","Ballivian, Jamile; Alcaide, Maria L; Cecchini, Diego; Jones, Deborah L; Abbamonte, John M; Cassetti, Isabel",J. acquir. immune defic. syndr,572,11

In regards to the latter point, this study poses the working hypothesis that industrial heritage can function as a tool for cultural sustainability, which allows for deconcentration away from historic city centers subjected to significant overtourism. To verify this hypothesis, a methodology has been designed based on the selection of specific indicators and the creation of maps, taking as reference data from the Tripadvisor travel portal. The results obtained are truly encouraging, and it would be interesting to expand this study by incorporating new case studies to allow us to discern additional patterns of behavior around urban industrial tourism.","Palacios-García, Antonio Barrado-Timón Diego Rodríguez-Esteban José Antonio",Sustainability,572,6
365954,365954,365954,Efficacy matters: broadening complement inhibition in COVID-19,16.644814,6.3218007,2020,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 has induced a worldwide pandemic and subsequent non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to control the spread of the virus. As in many countries, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Germany has led to a consecutive roll-out of different NPIs. As these NPIs have (largely unknown) adverse effects, targeting them precisely and monitoring their effectiveness are essential. We developed a compartmental infection dynamics model with specific features of SARS-CoV-2 that allows daily estimation of a time-varying reproduction number and published this information openly since the beginning of April 2020. Here, we present the transmission dynamics in Germany over time to understand the effect of NPIs and allow adaptive forecasts of the epidemic progression. METHODS: We used a data-driven estimation of the evolution of the reproduction number for viral spreading in Germany as well as in all its federal states using our model. Using parameter estimates from literature and, alternatively, with parameters derived from a fit to the initial phase of COVID-19 spread in different regions of Italy, the model was optimized to fit data from the Robert Koch Institute. RESULTS: The time-varying reproduction number (Rt) in Germany decreased to <1 in early April 2020, 2-3 weeks after the implementation of NPIs. Partial release of NPIs both nationally and on federal state level correlated with moderate increases in Rt until August 2020. Implications of state-specific Rt on other states and on national level are characterized. Retrospective evaluation of the model shows excellent agreement with the data and usage of inpatient facilities well within the healthcare limit. While short-term predictions may work for a few weeks, long-term projections are complicated by unpredictable structural changes. CONCLUSIONS: The estimated fraction of immunized population by August 2020 warns of a renewed outbreak upon release of measures. A low detection rate prolongs the delay reaching a low case incidence number upon release, showing the importance of an effective testing-quarantine strategy. We show that real-time monitoring of transmission dynamics is important to evaluate the extent of the outbreak, short-term projections for the burden on the healthcare system, and their response to policy changes.","Khailaie, Sahamoddin; Mitra, Tanmay; Bandyopadhyay, Arnab; Schips, Marta; Mascheroni, Pietro; Vanella, Patrizio; Lange, Berit; Binder, Sebastian C; Meyer-Hermann, Michael",BMC Med,572,3

This subtype exhibits a particularly poor prognosis and is characterized pathologically by its rhabdoid appearance. Here we present the case of an individual who was diagnosed with a sinonasal mass during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, which was ultimately found to be SMARCB (INI-1)-deficient sinonasal carcinoma. Advanced imaging was deferred in the interest of limiting the patient's exposure to the virus, and expedited operative management was performed which facilitated prompt referral for adjuvant chemoradiation.

It is posing a serious health and economic challenge worldwide. However, case fatality rates (CFRs) have varied amongst various countries ranging from 0 to 8.91%. We have evaluated the effect of selected socio-economic and health indicators to explain this variation in CFR. Countries reporting a minimum of 50 cases as on 14th March 2020, were selected for this analysis. Data about the socio-economic indicators of each country was accessed from the World bank database and data about the health indicators were accessed from the World Health Organisation (WHO) database. Various socioeconomic indicators and health indicators were selected for this analysis. After selecting from univariate analysis, the indicators with the maximum correlation were used to build a model using multiple variable linear regression with a forward selection of variables and using adjusted R-squared score as the metric. We found univariate regression results were significant for GDP (Gross Domestic Product) per capita, POD 30/70 (Probability Of Dying Between Age 30 And Exact Age 70 From Any of Cardiovascular Disease, Cancer, Diabetes or Chronic Respiratory Disease), HCI (Human Capital Index), GNI(Gross National Income) per capita, life expectancy, medical doctors per 10000 population, as these parameters negatively corelated with CFR (rho = -0.48 to -0.38 , p<0.05). Case fatality rate was regressed using ordinary least squares (OLS) against the socio-economic and health indicators. The indicators in the final model were GDP per capita, POD 30/70, HCI, life expectancy, medical doctors per 10,000, median age, current health expenditure per capita, number of confirmed cases and population in millions. The adjusted R-squared score was 0.306. Developing countries with a poor economy are especially vulnerable in terms of COVID-19 mortality and underscore the need to have a global policy to deal with this on-going pandemic. These trends largely confirm that the toll from COVID-19 will be worse in countries ill-equipped to deal with it. These analyses of epidemiological data are need of time as apart from increasing situational awareness, it guides us in taking informed interventions and helps policy-making to tackle this pandemic.","Asfahan, Shahir; Shahul, Aneesa; Chawla, Gopal; Dutt, Naveen; Niwas, Ram; Gupta, Neeraj",Monaldi arch. chest dis,572,16

OBJECTIVE: To provide the first snapshot of immediate impact of COVID-19 on Americans' stress, coping, and guideline adherence. DESIGN: Data were collected from an online workers' platform for survey research (Amazon's Mechanical Turk) from April 7 to 9, 2020. The current data represents the baseline of a longitudinal study. Best practices for ensuring high-quality data were employed. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals who are 18 years of age or older, living in the USA, and English-speaking were eligible for the study. Of 1086 unique responses, 1015 completed responses are included. SETTING: Population-based. MAIN OUTCOMES: Exposure to and stressfulness of COVID-19 stressors, coping strategies, and adherence to CDC guidelines. RESULTS: The sample was 53.9% women (n = 547), with an average age of 38.9 years (SD = 13.50, range = 18-88), most of whom were White (n = 836, 82.4%), non-Hispanic (n = 929, 91.5%), and straight/heterosexual (n = 895, 88.2%); 40% were currently married (n = 407), and 21.6% (n = 219) were caregivers. About half (50.5%) endorsed having at least ""mostly"" enough money to meet their needs. Respondents' locations across the USA ranged from 18.5% in the Northeast to 37.8% in the South. The most commonly experienced stressors were reading/hearing about the severity and contagiousness of COVID-19, uncertainty about length of quarantine and social distancing requirements, and changes to social and daily personal care routines. Financial concerns were rated most stressful. Younger age, female gender, and caregiver status increased risk for stressor exposure and greater degree of stressfulness. The most frequently reported strategies to manage stress were distraction, active coping, and seeking emotional social support. CDC guideline adherence was generally high, but several key social distancing and hygiene behaviors showed suboptimal adherence, particularly for men and younger adults. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Americans have high COVID-19 stress exposure and some demographic subgroups appear particularly vulnerable to stress effects. Subgroups less likely to adhere to CDC guidelines may benefit from targeted information campaigns. these findings may guide mental health interventions and inform policy-making regarding implications of specific public health measures.","Park, Crystal L; Russell, Beth S; Fendrich, Michael; Finkelstein-Fox, Lucy; Hutchison, Morica; Becker, Jessica",J Gen Intern Med,572,16

When a new epidemic or pandemic emerges, people are faced with the challenge of sorting through a great volume of varied information. Therefore, the dissemination of high-quality web-based information is essential during this time period. The overarching aim was to investigate the quality of web-based information about preventive measures and self care methods at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: in May 2020, consumer-oriented websites written in Swedish were identified via systematic searches in Google (n = 76). Websites were assessed with inductive content analysis, the JAMA benchmarks, the QUEST tool and the DISCERN instrument. RESULTS: seven categories and 33 subcategories were identified concerning preventive measures (md = 6.0 subcategories), with few specifying a method for washing hands (n = 4), when to sanitize the hands (n = 4), and a method for sanitizing the hands (n = 1). Eight categories and 30 subcategories were identified concerning self care methods (md = 3.0 subcategories), with few referring to the national number for telephone-based counseling (n = 20) and an online symptom assessment tool (n = 16). Overall, the median total quality scores were low (JAMA = 0/4, QUEST =13/28, DISCERN = 29/80). CONCLUSIONS: at the beginning of the pandemic, substantial quality deficits of websites about COVID-19 may have counteracted the public recommendations for preventive measures. This illustrates a critical need for standardized and systematic routines on how to achieve dissemination of high-quality web-based information when new epidemics and pandemics emerge.","Stern, Jenny; Georgsson, Susanne; Carlsson, Tommy",BMC Public Health,572,21

DESIGN: This was a retrospective cohort study designed to evaluate the association between body mass index and risk of severe disease in patients with coronavirus disease 2019. Data were abstracted from the electronic health record. The primary endpoint was a composite of intubation or death. SETTING: Two hospitals in Massachusetts (one quaternary referral center and one affiliated community hospital). PATIENTS: Consecutive patients hospitalized with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 admitted between March 13, 2020, and April 3, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 305 patients were included in this study. We stratified patients by body mass index category: < 25 kg/m (54 patients, 18%), &#8805; 25 kg/m to < 30 kg/m (124 patients, 41%), &#8805; 30 kg/m to < 35 kg/m (58 patients, 19%), and &#8805; 35 kg/m (69 patients, 23%). In total, 128 patients (42%) had a primary endpoint (119 patients [39%] were intubated and nine died [3%] without intubation). Sixty-five patients (51%) with body mass index greater than or equal to 30 kg/m were intubated or died. Adjusted Cox models demonstrated that body mass index greater than or equal to 30 kg/m was associated with a 2.3-fold increased risk of intubation or death (95% CI, 1.2-4.3) compared with individuals with body mass index less than 25 kg/m. Diabetes was also independently associated with risk of intubation or death (hazard ratio, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.2-2.7). Fifty-six out of 127 patients (44%) with body mass index greater than or equal to 30 kg/m had diabetes, and the combination of both diabetes and body mass index greater than or equal to 30 kg/m was associated with a 4.5-fold increased risk of intubation or death (95% CI, 2.0-10.2) compared with patients without diabetes and body mass index less than 25 kg/m. CONCLUSIONS: Among consecutive patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019, obesity was an independent risk factor for intubation or death.","Frank, Rachel C; Mendez, Sean R; Stevenson, Elizabeth K; Guseh, James S; Chung, Mabel; Silverman, Michael G",Crit Care Med,572,16

This study aimed to explore the practice of telemedicine in Pediatric Surgery in Germany, the impact of the pandemic on its development and parents' and surgeons' experiences with telemedicine. METHODS: The study is a cross-sectional analysis using three surveys between 6/2020 and 10/2020: (1) all Pediatric Surgery departments of Germany reported whether they provide telemedicine services. (2) Members of the German Society of Pediatric Surgery and (3) families who participated in an outpatient visit by telephone or video with the Department of Pediatric Surgery and Pediatric Urology of the University Hospital Frankfurt completed an anonymous survey on their experience with telemedicine. RESULTS: 21% of the Pediatric Surgery departments in Germany provided telemedicine, of which 57% started due to the pandemic. The lack of physical examination and face-to-face contact seem to be the major limitations to surgeons and parents. 48% of the parents answered that telemedicine is equal to or better than traditional appointments, while 33% thought that telemedicine is worse.

With the global spread of COVID-19 throughout the world and the need to have a real-time screening of the population, especially in crowded places, this study aimed to investigate the applicability of sniffer dogs to carry out such a task. METHODS: Firstly, three male and female dogs from German shepherd (Saray), German black (Kuzhi) and Labrador (Marco) breeds had been intensively trained throughout the classical conditioning method for 7 weeks. They were introduced to human specimens obtained from the throat and pharyngeal secretions of participants who were already reported positive or negative for SARS-COV-2 infection be RT-PCR. Each dog underwent the conditioning process for almost 1000 times. In the meantime another similar condition process was conducted on clothes and masks of COVID-19 patient using another three male and female dogs from Labrador (Lexi), Border gypsy (Sami), and Golden retriever (Zhico) breeds. In verification test for the first three dogs, 80 pharyngeal secretion samples consisting of 26 positive and 54 negative samples from different medical centers who underwent RT-PCR test were in a single-blind method. In the second verification test for the other three dogs, masks and clothes of 50 RT-PCR positive and 70 RT-PCR negative cases from different medical center were used. RESULTS: In verification test using pharyngeal secretion, the sniffer dogs' detection capability was associated with a 65% of sensitivity and 89% of specificity and they amanged to identify 17 out of the 26 positive and 48 out of the 54 true negative samples. In the next verification test using patients' face masks and clothes, 43 out of the 50 positive samples were correctly identified by the dogs. Moreover, out of the 70 negative samples, 65 samples were correctly found to be negative. The sensitivity of this test was as high as 86% and its specificity was 92.9%. In addition, the positive and negative predictive values were 89.6 and 90.3%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Dogs are capable of being trained to identify COVID-19 cases by sniffing their odour, so they can be used as a reliable tool in limited screening.","Eskandari, Esmaeil; Ahmadi Marzaleh, Milad; Roudgari, Hassan; Hamidi Farahani, Ramin; Nezami-Asl, Amir; Laripour, Reza; Aliyazdi, Helen; Dabbagh Moghaddam, Arasb; Zibaseresht, Ramin; Akbarialiabad, Hossein; Yousefi Zoshk, Mojtaba; Shiri, Hamidreza; Shiri, Mahdi",BMC Infect Dis,572,26

However, how these two potential roles come together under physiological settings remain unknown. Since both regulated exocytosis and NF-&#954;B signaling are determinants of mast cell (MC) functions, we generated mice lacking ELKS1 in connective tissue MCs (Elks1f/f Mcpt5-Cre) and found that while ELKS1 is dispensable for NF-&#954;B-mediated cytokine production, it is essential for MC degranulation both in vivo and in vitro. Impaired degranulation was caused by reduced transcription of Syntaxin 4 (STX4) and Syntaxin binding protein 2 (Stxpb2), resulting from a lack of ELKS1-mediated stabilization of lysine-specific demethylase 2B (Kdm2b), which is an essential regulator of STX4 and Stxbp2 transcription. These results suggest a transcriptional role for active-zone proteins like ELKS1 and suggest that they may regulate exocytosis through a novel mechanism involving transcription of key exocytosis proteins.","Lam, Hiu Yan; Arumugam, Surendar; Bae, Han Gyu; Wang, Cheng Chun; Jung, Sangyong; St John, Ashley Lauren; Hong, Wanjin; Han, Weiping; Tergaonkar, Vinay",Sci.

As such, many pregnant women have reservations about receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. However, pregnant women are of particular concern as they are considered a vulnerable population due to the increased risk of severe complications from COVID-19. This study investigates the willingness of pregnant patients to receive the vaccine before and after discussion with a health care provider. Methods: 124 pregnant women were surveyed from February to March of 2021 at a perinatal center. Patients were queried about their willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine before and after reading a fact sheet and discussing the vaccine's safety with a provider. Results: There was a statistically significant effect of discussing the vaccine with a physician regarding patients' willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Additionally, patients who received the annual influenza vaccine were significantly more likely to get the COVID-19 vaccine. Conclusion: Pregnant women were more willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine after discussion with a health care provider. The importance and impact of health education should be given special consideration in medical offices.of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the CDC recommend the authorization and use of the COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant women. Several studies have analyzed the acceptance and willingness of the general population to receive the COVID-19 vaccine in the United States. However, there is limited data regarding the attitudes and perceptions of pregnant women towards receiving the vaccine. The decision to receive the vaccine is a source of confusion and conflict for many pregnant women, making this an important topic of discussion between patients and obstetrics and gynecology providers.

Lockdown rules imposed to counteract the rapid growth of COVID-19, mainly social restrictions, have represented a risk factor for developing depressive and anxious symptoms. The research aims are to explore the effect of coping strategies and perceived social support on depressive and anxious symptomatology during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ninety-six healthy people (46 males, mean age = 39.3; SD = 16.6) completed through on-line platform: Socio-demographic questionnaire, Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (CISS), Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) and Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R), 3 weeks after the imposition of lockdown restrictions. SCL-90-R Depression scores showed significant positive correlation with CISS Emotion (r = 0.85; p = 0.001) and Avoidant (r = 0.34; p = 0.018), a significant negative correlation with MSPSS Family support (r = -0.43; p = 0.003). SCL-90-R Anxiety scores showed a significant positive correlation with CISS Emotion (r = 0.72; p = 0.001) and Avoidant (r = 0.35; p = 0.016). No significant correlations between both CISS Emotion and Avoidant scales with social support emerged. Two Multiple Linear Regression analysis were performed using, respectively, SCL-90-R Depression and Anxiety scores as dependent variables, and the CISS and MSPSS scales, age, and gender as predictors. The first regression model (R 2 = 0.78; adjusted R 2 = 0.75) revealed CISS Emotion (ß = 0.83; p = 0.001) and MSPSS Family support (ß = -0.24; p = 0.004) had a predictive effect on SCL-90-R Depression scores. The second regression model (R 2 = 0.52; adjusted R 2 = 0.472) revealed that only CISS Emotion (ß = 0.71; p = 0.001) predicted the SCL-90-R Anxiety scores. In conclusion, during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns, coping focus on emotions seemed to increase anxious and depressive symptoms, probably due to the uncontrollable nature of the stressful event and the high emotional response. Family support which reduces the sense of loneliness had an exclusive role in mitigating depressive symptoms. These results highlight the importance of promoting psychological strategies to improve emotional regulation skills, reducing isolation from family, to prevent mood symptomatology in healthy citizens during large-scale health crises.","Mariani, Rachele; Renzi, Alessia; Di Trani, Michela; Trabucchi, Guido; Danskin, Kerri; Tambelli, Renata",Front Psychiatry,572,32

It has also had a significant impact on the ability of unaffected children to be physically active. We evaluated the effect of deconditioning from social distancing and school shutdowns implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic on the cardiovascular fitness of healthy unaffected children. This is a single-center, retrospective case-control study performed in an urban tertiary referral center. A cohort of 10 healthy children that underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing after COVID-19 hospital restrictions were lifted was compared to a matched cohort before COVID-19-related shutdowns on school and after-school activities. Comparisons of oxygen uptake (VO2) max and VO2 at anaerobic threshold between the pre- and post-COVID-19 cohorts were done. The VO2 max in the post-COVID cohort was significantly lower than in the pre-COVID cohort (39.1 vs. 44.7, p = 0.031). Only one out of ten patients had a higher VO2 max when compared to their matched pre-COVID control and was also the only patient with a documented history of participation in varsity-type athletics. The percentile of predicted VO2 was significantly lower in the post-COVID cohort (95% vs. 105%, p = 0.042). This study for the first time documented a significant measurable decline in physical fitness of healthy children as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated restrictions. Measures need to be identified that encourage and facilitate regular exercise in children in a way that are not solely dependent on school and organized after-school activities.","Dayton, Jeffrey D; Ford, Kelley; Carroll, Sheila J; Flynn, Patrick A; Kourtidou, Soultana; Holzer, Ralf J",Pediatr. cardiol,572,1

We generated maVie16, a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2, by serial passaging of a human isolate. In silico modelling revealed how Spike mutations of maVie16 enhanced interaction with murine ACE2. MaVie16 induced profound pathology in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice and the resulting mouse COVID-19 (mCOVID-19) replicated critical aspects of human disease, including early lymphopenia, pulmonary immune cell infiltration, pneumonia and specific adaptive immunity. Inhibition of the proinflammatory cytokines IFN{gamma} and TNF substantially reduced immunopathology. Importantly, genetic ACE2-deficiency completely prevented mCOVID-19 development.

The unidentified infected population means the infected but not identified people. They are not yet hospitalized and still can spread the disease to the susceptible. To estimate the unidentified infected population, we find the optimal model parameters which best fit the confirmed case data in the least-squares sense. Here, we use the time series data of the confirmed cases in China reported by World Health Organization. In addition, we perform the practical identifiability analysis of the proposed model using the Monte Carlo simulation. The proposed model is simple but potentially useful in estimating the unidentified infected population to monitor the effectiveness of interventions and to prepare the quantity of protective masks or COVID-19 diagnostic kit to supply, hospital beds, medical staffs, and so on. Therefore, to control the spread of the infectious disease, it is essential to estimate the number of the unidentified infected population. The proposed SUC model can be used as a basic building block mathematical equation for estimating unidentified infected population.","Lee, Chaeyoung; Li, Yibao; Kim, Junseok",Chaos Solitons Fractals,572,25

Methods: an adapted risk stratification tool was circulated to all staff through their respective heads of departments/units. Staff were expected to voluntary assess their health and risk status in the context of COVID-19, using the tool. A central multi-disciplinary screening committee assessed submissions and invited staff who required further evaluation for physical interviews. Respondents were categorized into three risk/exposure groups from lowest to highest - A, B, and C, based on their individual health assessments, occupational exposures, and information obtained from direct interviews. Results: the committee received submissions from 746 staff, representing 19.4% (about a fifth) of the hospital's 3,840 staff. One hundred and twenty two of these were invited for physical interviews, of whom 88 (72.1%) were categorized as high risk (Category C): pregnancy (53.4%); bronchial asthma (19.3%); hypertension (11.4%); cancer (3.4%) and sickle cell disease (2.3%); fractures and pulmonary tuberculosis (1%, respectively). These staff were recommended for redeployment from areas of high risk exposure to COVID-19. Conclusion: a management-driven risk assessment of hospital staff in preparation for the COVID-19 pandemic revealed that a fifth of staff assessed themselves as being vulnerable to adverse outcomes from exposure. It is our hope that similar risk stratification programmes will become standard practice in healthcare facilities during disease outbreaks, especially in Africa.","Obaseki, Darlington Ewaen; Akoria, Obehi Aituaje; Mokogwu, Ndubuisi; Omuemu, Casimir Erhunmwun; Okwara, Benson Uchechukwu; Ogboghodo, Esohe Olivia",Pan Afr Med J,572,16

Mitigation policies intended to combat the novel coronavirus offer a real-world measure of citizen compliance, allowing us to examine the determinants of asymmetrical responsiveness. Analyzing county-level cellphone data, we leverage staggered roll-out to estimate the causal effect of stay-at-home orders on mobility using a difference-in-differences strategy. We find movement is significantly curtailed, and examination of descriptive heterogeneous effects suggests the key roles that partisanship and trust play in producing irregular compliance. We find that Republican-leaning counties comply less than Democratic-leaning ones, which we argue underlines the importance of trust in science and acceptance of large-scale government policies for compliance. However, this partisan compliance gap shrinks when directives are given by Republican leaders, suggesting citizens are more trusting of co-partisan leaders. Furthermore, we find that higher levels of social trust increase compliance;yet these gains attenuate or intensify depending upon community-level partisan sentiments. Our study provides a real-world, behavioral measure that demonstrates the influence of partisanship, social trust, and their interaction on citizen welfare. Finally, we argue that our results speak to how trust in government may impact successful containment of the COVID-19 pandemic. © The Author(s), 2021.","Goldstein, D. A.

Benincasa hispida is being used in the treatment of various neurological diseases in Ayurveda system of medicine. The objective of the study was to investigate the effect of Benincasa hispida fruit extract in the Alzheimer's disease rats. METHODS: Benincasa hispida fruits extract was administered orally for 16 weeks at doses of 250 and 500-mg/kg/day. The cognitive deficits were examined by behavioural tests like Morris water maze test, Y-maze and rota-rod test. Biochemical and neurochemical analysis of Acetylcholine, dopamine, serotonin levels and anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory markers were evaluated and the mRNA expression of Keap/Nrf2 axis was analysed by RT-PCR. RESULTS: Aluminum chloride (AlCl3) induction altered the behavioural profile and produced significant alterations in the cortical and hippocampal regions of the brain and the treatment with Benincasa hispida extract at doses of 250-mg/kg/day (p<0.05) and 500mg/kg/day (p<0.05) alleviated the acetylcholine, dopamine and serotonin neurotransmitter levels. The antioxidant enzyme markers such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), Catalase (CAT), glutathione (GSH) were increased and the oxidative stress marker malondialdehyde(MDA) was decreased.

Adult-centered guidelines have been established in order to provide direction for healthcare professionals, allowing integration of the newest screening policies and therapeutic strategies into their practices. However, for children and adolescents, HCV is a significant, unrecognized public health problem. HCV infection rates in the United States in women of childbearing age and those who are pregnant have increased in parallel with the rising opioid epidemic. An estimated 29000 women with HCV infection gave birth each year from 2011 to 2014 in the United States, with approximately 1700 of their infants being infected with HCV. Newer HCV-specific therapeutics, namely direct acting antivirals (DAA), has brought a new and highly successful approach to treatment of hepatitis C. Recent studies have confirmed similar levels of effectiveness and safety of DAA therapies in the pediatric population. Thus, an enhanced cascade of care, which should include the population under 18 years of age, can help achieve the WHO goal by focusing on elimination in the youngest populations.

Hospital-based care for COVID-19 is often needed, particularly among older adults. However, a key barrier to accessing hospital care in sub-Saharan Africa is travel time to the nearest health-care facility. To inform the geographical targeting of additional health-care resources, we aimed to estimate travel time at a 1 km x 1 km resolution to the nearest hospital and to the nearest health-care facility of any type for adults aged 60 years and older in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods We assembled a dataset on the geolocation of health-care facilities, separately for hospitals and any type of health-care facility and including both private-sector and public-sector facilities, using data from the OpenStreetMap project and the Kenya Medical Research Institute-Wellcome Trust Programme. Population data at a 1 km x 1 km resolution were obtained from WorldPop. We estimated travel time to the nearest health-care facility for each 1 km x 1 km grid using a cost-distance algorithm. Findings 9.6% (95% CI 5.2-16.9) of adults aged 60 years or older across sub-Saharan Africa had an estimated travel time to the nearest hospital of 6 h or longer, varying from 0.0% (0.0-3.7) in Burundi and The Gambia to 40.9% (31.8-50.7) in Sudan. For the nearest health-care facility of any type (whether primary, secondary, or tertiary care), 15.9% (95% CI 10.1-24-4) of adults aged 60 years or older across sub-Saharan Africa had an estimated travel tune of 2 h or longer, ranging from 0.4% (0.0-4.4) in Burundi to 59.4% (50.1-69.0) in Sudan. Most countries in sub-Saharan Africa contained populated areas in which adults aged 60 years and older had a travel time to the nearest hospital of 12 h or longer and to the nearest health-care facility of any type of 6 h or longer. The median travel time to the nearest hospital for the fifth of adults aged 60 years or older with the longest travel tunes was 348 min (IQR 240-576;equal to 5.8 h) for the entire population of sub-Saharan Africa, ranging from 41 min (34-54) in Burundi to 1655 min (1065-2440;equal to 27.6 h) in Gabon. Interpretation Our high-resolution maps of estimated travel times to both hospitals and health-care facilities of any type can be used by policy makers and non-governmental organisations to help target additional health-care resources, such as makeshift hospitals or transport programmes to existing health-care facilities, to older adults with the least physical access to care. In addition, this analysis shows the locations of population groups most likely to under-report COVID-19 symptoms because of low physical access to health-care facilities. Beyond the COVID-19 response, this study can inform the efforts of countries to improve physical access to care for conditions that are common among older adults in the region, such as chronic non-communicable diseases.

Therefore, a common mental model for determining value is critical in order to use telehealth in ways that produce win-win situations for most if not all four stakeholder groups. In this chapter, we present important principles and concepts from previously published frameworks to propose an approach to telehealth evaluation that can be used for perinatal health. Such a framework will then drive future development and implementation of telehealth programs to provide value for all relevant stakeholders in a perinatal health care system.","Chuo, John; Chandler, Ali; Lorch, Scott",Semin Perinatol,572,2

The prospective observational COronaVIrus-surviVAl (COVIVA) study performed at the University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland consecutively enrolled patients with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. We compared patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 with patients who tested negative but with an adjudicated diagnosis of a respiratory tract infection, including pneumonia. The primary outcome measure was death at 30 days, and the secondary outcomes were AKI incidence and a composite endpoint of death, intensive care treatment or rehospitalization at 30 days. Five hundred and seven patients were diagnosed with respiratory tract infections, and of those, 183 (36%) had a positive PCR swab test for SARS-CoV-2. The incidence of AKI was higher in patients with COVID-19 (30% versus 12%, p &lt;0.001), more severe (KDIGO stage 3, 22% versus 13%, p = 0.009) and more often required renal replacement therapy (4.4% versus 0.93%;p = 0.03).

COVID-19 has only worsened this situation.1 An opioid receptor antagonist (ORA) such as naloxone is the most common intervention for OIRD. However, with increasing overdose from highly potent illicit opioids and polysubstance abuse, appraisal of the adequacy of ORA seems warranted and timely. COMMENT: OIRD results from the binding of an excess number of agonist molecules to opioid receptors. Mechanistically, it makes sense to reverse this by displacing agonist molecules by administering an ORA. But realistically, the trend to higher-potency agonists and polysubstance abuse diminishes the effectiveness of this approach. We are left facing a crisis without a solution. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: For the increasingly common OIRD from highly potent illicit agonists and polysubstance overdose, ORAs are correspondingly less effective. Alternatives are needed-soon.","Peppin, John F; Pergolizzi, Joseph V; Dahan, Albert; Raffa, Robert B",J Clin Pharm Ther,572,21

Many retroviruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus, are similarly zoonotic; however, only infectious exogenous gammaretroviruses have recently been identified in bats. Here, viral metagenomic sequencing of samples from bats submitted for rabies virus testing, largely due to human exposure, identified a novel, highly divergent exogenous Deltaretrovirus from a big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus) in South Dakota. The virus sequence, corresponding to Eptesicus fuscus deltaretrovirus (EfDRV), comprised a nearly complete coding region comprised of canonical 5'-gag-pro-pol-env-3' genes with 37% to 51% identity to human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV), an infectious retrovirus that causes T-cell lymphoma. A putative tax gene with 27% identity to HTLV was located downstream of the pol gene along with a gene harbored in an alternative reading frame which possessed a conserved domain for an Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen involved in gene transactivation, suggesting a regulatory function similar to that of the deltaretrovirus rex gene. A TaqMan reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) targeting the pol gene identified 4/60 (6.7%) bats as positive for EfDRV, which, combined with a search of the E. fuscus genome that failed to identify sequences with homology to EfDRV, suggests that EfDRV is an infectious exogenous virus. As all known members of Deltaretrovirus can cause malignancies and E. fuscus is widely distributed in the Americas, often with a colonial roosting behavior in human dwellings, further studies are needed to investigate potential zoonosis.IMPORTANCE Bats host a large numbers of viruses, many of which are zoonotic. In the United States, the big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus) is widely distributed and lives in small colonies that roost in cavities, often in human dwellings, leading to frequent human interaction. Viral metagenomic sequencing of samples from an E. fuscus bat submitted for rabies testing identified the first exogenous bat Deltaretrovirus The E. fuscus deltaretrovirus (EfDRV) genome consists of the typical deltaretrovial 5'-gag-pro-pol-env-3' genes along with genes encoding two putative transcriptional transactivator proteins distantly related to the Tax protein of human T-cell lymphotrophic virus and nuclear antigen 3B of Epstein-Barr virus. Searches of the E. fuscus genome sequence failed to identify endogenous EfDRV. RT-PCR targeting the EfDRV pol gene identified 4/60 (6.7%) bats with positive results. Together, these results suggest that EfDRV is exogenous. As all members of Deltaretrovirus are associated with T- and B-cell malignancies or neurologic disease, further studies on possible zoonosis are warranted.","Hause, Ben M; Nelson, Eric A; Christopher-Hennings, Jane",MSphere,572,26

The fact that women often report a negative experience with vaginal childbirth, with physical pain and feelings of unsafety, neglect, or abuse, may explain the high acceptability of elective cesarean sections. The recognition of information needs and of the right to informed choice during childbirth can help change this reality. The internet has been the main source of health information, but its quality is highly variable. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and evaluate an information and communication strategy through a smartphone app with respect to childbirth, to facilitate informed choices for access to safer and evidence-based care in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial, with 2 arms (intervention and control) and a closed, blind, parallel design, will be conducted with a smartphone app designed for behavior and opinion research in Brazil, with women of reproductive age previously registered on the app. After completing an entry questionnaire to verify the eligibility criteria and obtaining ethical consent, approximately 20,000 participants will be randomly allocated to the intervention and control groups at a 1:1 ratio. Participants allocated to the intervention group will be invited to engage in a digital information and communication strategy, which is designed to expand evidence-based knowledge on the advantages and disadvantages of options for labor and childbirth and the safety of the care processes. The information is based on the guidelines of the Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization for a positive childbirth experience and has been updated to include the new challenges and disruptions in maternity care within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The control group will receive information regarding disposable and reusable diapers as a placebo intervention. The groups will be compared in their responses in generating the birth plan and the entry and exit questionnaires, regarding responses less or more aligned with the guidelines for a positive childbirth experience. A qualitative component to map information needs is included. RESULTS: The digital trial started recruiting participants in late October 2020, and data collection has been projected to be complete by December 2020. CONCLUSIONS: This study will evaluate an innovative intervention that has the potential to promote better communication between women and providers, such that they can make better choices using an approach suitable for use during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Overall, mean age was 46.7 years, 51.8% were male, 22.9% had severe disease, and mortality was 5.6%. Underlying immunosuppression, diabetes, and malignancy were most strongly associated with severe COVID-19 (coefficient = 53.9, 23.4, 23.4, respectively, all P < .0007), while older age, male gender, diabetes, and hypertension were also associated with higher mortality (coefficient = 0.05 per year, 5.1, 8.2, 6.99, respectively; P = .006-.0002). Gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain) and respiratory symptoms (shortness of breath, chest pain) were associated with severe COVID-19, while pneumonia and end-organ failure were associated with mortality. COVID-19 is associated with a severe disease course in about 23% and mortality in about 6% of infected persons. Individuals with comorbidities and clinical features associated with severity should be monitored closely, and preventive efforts should especially target those with diabetes, malignancy, and immunosuppression.","Li, Jie; Huang, Daniel Q; Zou, Biyao; Yang, Hongli; Hui, Wan Zi; Rui, Fajuan; Yee, Natasha Tang Sook; Liu, Chuanli; Nerurkar, Sanjna Nilesh; Kai, Justin Chua Ying; Teng, Margaret Li Peng; Li, Xiaohe; Zeng, Hua; Borghi, John A; Henry, Linda; Cheung, Ramsey; Nguyen, Mindie H",J. med. virol,572,16

It causes severe acute respiratory syndrome that leads to death. Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has, to date, infected more than 79 million people globally foremost to more than 1.7 million deaths and an extraordinary impact on facilities. Generally, this disease has rapidly disseminated all over the world in healthcare more than 200 countries including Egypt. To understand the impact of temperature and humidity on outbreak of this disease in Egyptian environment, this study was carried out to describe current knowledge about the appearance and speed of COVID-19 transmission. The daily recorded temperature (low and high T), and relative humidity (RH) in relation to the daily counts of COVID-19 cases in Egypt were evaluated. This study was undertaken since the data of daily infected people collected and announced daily by the Egyptian Ministry of Health and population (beginning of March till the first week of August, 2020). The results of our collected data, analyzed by using Pearson test, showed that the values of minimum temperature has significant influence on the increase of infected cases of COVID-19 (r= 0.60, n=160, p &lt;= 0.040). In the meantime, the multiple regression analysis revealed that the whole factors including minimum, maximum and relative humidity showed a positive significant relationship with the number of daily infected cases of COVID-19, (F. ratio= 125.375, p &lt;= 0.000). In parallel, the number of infection cases rapidly decreased with increasing in the recorded temperature, relative humidity and UV index.","Moustafa, A. A.; Mansour, S.

Bilingual research staff surveyed 422 New York City taxi/FHV drivers using a stratified sampling approach in driver-frequented locations to examine drivers' health and financial planning behaviors for the first time. Drivers lacked health insurance at double the NYC rate (20% vs. 10%). Life insurance and retirement savings rates were lower than U.S. averages (20% vs. 60%, 25% vs. 58%, respectively). Vehicle ownership was a significant predictor of health insurance, life insurance, and retirement savings. Compared to South Asian drivers, Sub-Saharan African drivers were significantly less likely to have health insurance and North African, and Middle Eastern drivers were significantly less likely to have retirement savings. Although most drivers indicated the importance of insurance and benefits, < 50% understood how to use them. Drivers felt primary care coverage to be most important followed by other health-related coverage, retirement benefits, and life insurance. Results reveal compelling addressable gaps in insurance and benefits coverage and the need to implement accessible financial literacy with navigation and advising services and programs.","Gany, Francesca; Mirpuri, Sheena; Kim, Soo Young; Narang, Bharat; Ramirez, Julia; Roberts-Eversley, Nicole; Ocampo, Alex; Aragones, Abraham; Leng, Jennifer",J. community health,572,16

In this article we recapitulate the molecular mechanisms of host cell entry of SARS-CoV­2 and discuss the current evidence for a potential conjunctival transmission of SARS-CoV­2. The current body of evidence indicates that SARS-CoV­2 requires the membrane-bound angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the membrane-bound serine protease TMPRSS2 to enter cells. Recent studies suggest that COVID-19 patients rarely exhibit viral RNA in tear film and conjunctival smears and that, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are only expressed in very small amounts in the conjunctiva, making conjunctival infection with SARS-CoV­2 via these mediators unlikely. Nevertheless, we consider the current evidence to be still too limited to provide a conclusive statement and recommend appropriate protective measures for healthcare personnel who are in close contact with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients.","Lange, Clemens; Wolf, Julian; Auw-Haedrich, Claudia; Schlecht, Anja; Boneva, Stefaniya; Lapp, Thabo; Agostini, Hansjürgen; Martin, Gottfried; Reinhard, Thomas; Schlunck, Günther",Ophthalmologe,572,23

Severe COVID-19 is associated with substantial pneumonitis and has a number of shared major risk factors with IPF. This study aimed to determine the genetic correlation between IPF and severe COVID-19 and assess a potential causal role of genetically increased risk of IPF on COVID-19 severity. METHODS: The genetic correlation between IPF and COVID-19 severity was estimated with linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression. We performed a Mendelian randomization (MR) study for IPF causality in COVID-19. Genetic variants associated with IPF susceptibility (P<5 × 10-8) in previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were used as instrumental variables (IVs). Effect estimates of those IVs on COVID-19 severity were gathered from the GWAS meta-analysis by the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (4,336 cases & 623,902 controls). FINDINGS: We detected a positive genetic correlation of IPF with COVID-19 severity (rg=0·31 [95% CI 0·04-0·57], P = 0·023). The MR estimates for severe COVID-19 did not reveal any genetic association (OR 1·05, [95% CI 0·92-1·20], P = 0·43). However, outlier analysis revealed that the IPF risk allele rs35705950 at MUC5B had a different effect compared with the other variants. When rs35705950 was excluded, MR results provided evidence that genetically increased risk of IPF has a causal effect on COVID-19 severity (OR 1·21, [95% CI 1·06-1·38], P = 4·24 × 10-3). Furthermore, the IPF risk-allele at MUC5B showed an apparent protective effect against COVID-19 hospitalization only in older adults (OR 0·86, [95% CI 0·73-1·00], P = 2·99 × 10-2) . INTERPRETATION: The strongest genetic determinant of IPF, rs35705950 at MUC5B, seems to confer protection against COVID-19, whereas the combined effect of all other IPF risk loci seem to confer risk of COVID-19 severity. The observed effect of rs35705950 could either be due to protective effects of mucin over-production on the airways or a consequence of selection bias due to (1) a patient group that is heavily enriched for the rs35705950 T undertaking strict self-isolation and/or (2) due to survival bias of the rs35705950 non-IPF risk allele carriers. Due to the diverse impact of IPF causal variants on SARS-CoV-2 infection, with a possible selection bias as an explanation, further investigation is needed to address this apparent paradox between variance at MUC5B and other IPF genetic risk factors.

The nature and determinants of household transmission are poorly understood. METHODS: To address this gap, we gathered and analyzed data from 22 published and pre-published studies from 10 countries (20,291 household contacts) that were available through September 2, 2020. Our goal was to combine estimates of the SARS-CoV-2 household secondary attack rate (SAR) and explore variation in estimates of the household SAR. RESULTS: The overall pooled random-effects estimate of the household SAR was 17.1% (95% CI: 13.7-21.2%). In study-level, random-effects meta-regressions stratified by testing frequency (1 test, 2 tests, >2 tests), SAR estimates were 9.2% (95% CI: 6.7-12.3%), 17.5% (95% CI: 13.9-21.8%), and 21.3% (95% CI: 13.8-31.3%), respectively. Household SAR tended to be higher among older adult contacts and among contacts of symptomatic cases. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that SAR reported using a single follow-up test may be underestimated and that testing household contacts of COVID-19 cases on multiple occasions may increase the yield for identifying secondary cases.","Fung, Hannah F; Martinez, Leonardo; Alarid-Escudero, Fernando; Salomon, Joshua A; Studdert, David M; Andrews, Jason R; Goldhaber-Fiebert, Jeremy D",Clin. infect. dis,572,16

We focused on changes in T&O practice, training and redeployment of Trainees. Units differ considerably in several aspects of practice. We found a 97% reduction in elective operating, 64% reduction in elective outpatient activity and 37% reduction in operative trauma. 58% of trainees continued working in T&O clinics, with an average of 6 operative cases over this period.

In the department of Pas-de-Calais, one step of the crisis measures was setting up a psychiatric regulation line, which aims to manage calls with strong emotional valence (in connexion with containment, anxiety related to the epidemic context, or break in psychiatric cares for people suffering of mental disorders). This psychiatric hotline was provided from 20 March 2020 to 15 May 2020 by fifteen psychiatric careers (psychiatrists, psychologists and psychiatric nurses) from the network of the medical-psychological emergency unit (unit of the emergency call center which aims to manage people involved in psychotraumatic events). In total, 556 calls were answered, i.e. an average of 9,8 calls per day. The typology of calls was in a quarter of the cases anxiety related to the fear of being infected, in the second quarter, adjustment disorders related to containment, and for about half of the calls, psychiatrics symptoms whether it was preexisting and increased by the discontinuation of care, or context-induced. The benefits identified by this device were as follows: -the discharge of time-consuming calls for the medical dispatcher assistant, -the expertise of a mental health professional, knowing the mental health network, to make the decision more fluid. Last but not least, it is interesting to note that the presence of the psychiatric regulator in the regulation room allowed a transfer of calls and a reciprocal acculturation. In view of the relevance of the establishment of a psychiatric regulation line in the epidemic context of Covid-19, it seems interesting to consider the sustainability of this system, which is part of a global context of evolution of the provision of emergency care.","Rougegrez, Laure; Dupont, Marine",Ann. med.-psychol,572,24

MATERIALS AND METHODS: SARS-CoV-2, USA-WA1/2020 strain virus stock was prepared prior to testing by growing in Vero 76 cells. The culture media for prepared virus stock was minimum essential medium (MEM) with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 50 µg/mL gentamicin. Test compounds consisting of PVP-I oral rinse solutions and H2 O2 aqueous solutions were mixed directly with the virus solution so that the final concentration was 50% of the test compound and 50% of the virus solution. Thus PVP-I was tested at concentrations of 0.5%, 1.25%, and 1.5%, and H2 O2 was tested at 3% and 1.5% concentrations to represent clinically recommended concentrations. Ethanol and water were evaluated in parallel as standard positive and negative controls. All samples were tested at contact periods of 15 seconds and 30 seconds. Surviving virus from each sample was then quantified by standard end-point dilution assay and the log reduction value of each compound compared to the negative control was calculated. RESULTS: After the 15-second and 30-second contact times, PVP-I oral antiseptic rinse at all 3 concentrations of 0.5%, 1.25%, and 1.5% completely inactivated SARS-CoV-2. The H2 O2 solutions at concentrations of 1.5% and 3.0% showed minimal viricidal activity after 15 seconds and 30 seconds of contact time. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 virus was completely inactivated by PVP-I oral antiseptic rinse in vitro, at the lowest concentration of 0.5 % and at the lowest contact time of 15 seconds. Hydrogen peroxide at the recommended oral rinse concentrations of 1.5% and 3.0% was minimally effective as a viricidal agent after contact times as long as 30 seconds. Therefore, preprocedural rinsing with diluted PVP-I in the range of 0.5% to 1.5% may be preferred over hydrogen peroxide during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bidra, Avinash S; Pelletier, Jesse S; Westover, Jonna B; Frank, Samantha; Brown, Seth M; Tessema, Belachew",J. prosthodont,572,16

Interview with Ivan Cherrez,16.213318,6.6272144,2020,"Geriatricians have long debated the parameters, positioning, and prospects of their specialty. The year 2020 started full of promise as many organizations anticipated assessing themselves using perfect, or 2020, vision. While challenging on several levels, the momentous combination of events in 2020-the COVID-19 pandemic, Racial Justice Movement, and the November elections-provided Geriatric Medicine several opportunities to firmly secure a position in the mainstream. As we reflect on the new perspectives, programs, and partnerships initiated in 2020, five broader lessons emerge that can help safeguard the future of Geriatrics: the field could employ more intentional ""direct to consumer"" marketing strategies, expand the scope of what it means to be a patient advocate, pursue new strategic partnerships, take the opportunity to address racial injustice, and leverage existing skillsets to expand scope of care for patients. Given the interdisciplinary nature of Geriatrics, it is fitting that many of these lessons build upon this collaborative philosophy and are derived from domains outside of health care. So in an unexpected way, the events of 2020 may actually help Geriatrics see, with 2020 vision, how to remain mainstream. With this new clarity, Geriatrics holds renewed promise to truly become specialists in whole-person care and it is our hope that, with insight from the lessons shared here, the specialty brings this vision to fruition in the current decade and beyond.","Pandit, Sonia G; Walke, Lisa M",J. am. geriatr. soc,572,7

Another reduction that has been reported is in the number of strokes presenting to hospitals, despite the virus implicated in causing a hypercoagulable state. Acute exposure to air pollution has been linked to increase in stroke incidence and the improvement in air quality may be responsible for the decrease in stroke presentations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To explore this hypothesis, we compared the air quality index (AQI) of Karachi, the largest cosmopolitan city of Pakistan, during the lockdown period in 2020 to the same period in the previous year. RESULTS: We found a significant drop in AQI depicting an improvement in air quality. Simultaneously, we identified a drop in number of stroke admissions to less than half from 2019 to 2020 at one of the largest tertiary care hospitals of the city, during this period of interest. CONCLUSION: We hypothesize that one important reason for this drop in stroke admissions, may be an actual reduction in stroke incidence brought about by an improvement in air quality.","Hameed, Sajid; Khan, Maria; Fatmi, Zafar; Wasay, Mohammad",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,572,21

Defining a clear strategy for selecting participants for ""high-demand"" Covid-19 treatment trials is important to avoid ad hoc and potentially biased decision-making by local investigators, which could inadvertently compromise a trial's social value, participants' interests, or fairness. In this article, we propose a set of ethical criteria for evaluating participant-selection strategies for such trials. We argue that the pandemic context-in particular, great urgency to develop safe and effective treatments, uncertainty surrounding Covid-19, and strain on the health care system that limits the time and effort available for trial enrollment-favors participant-selection strategies that optimize the ease of enrollment and, ideally, social value.

Groups were intentionally structured to include a diversity of majors and GPAs. Students were provided with data collected in previous years. Consultants met with each group at least 3 times, serving as expert advisors to help A&P students: 1) understand VO2max and lactate threshold physiology, 2) understand VO2max and lactate threshold testing procedures, 3) develop a research question with appropriately-designed data comparisons and statistical tests, 4) analyze data from two conditions (caffeine and no caffeine), and 5) create appropriate figures, analyze results, and form conclusions based on data. The project successfully replaced a hands-on lab experience due to the Consultants? prior experience conducting and analyzing data from maximal exercise tests, as well as developing research questions based on maximal exercise testing. Consultants provided A&P students with an additional resource for success and helped instructors manage their workload during the transition to emergency online instruction.

Design/methodology/approach This study scrapes a sample of tweets communicated by major global listed firms between March 1, 2020 and April 30, 2020 and identifies disclosures that mention firm engagement in stakeholder-oriented actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Cross-sectional regression analysis is used to examine the relationship between firms' social performance and the number of tweets they post about stakeholder-oriented COVID-19 actions. Further, firms' financial resilience is examined as a moderating factor of this relationship. Findings The results show that firms with better social performance are more likely to engage in and, hence, communicate stakeholder-oriented actions for the COVID-19 pandemic on Twitter. Moreover, it is evident that firms with better social performance communicate more stakeholder-oriented actions only when they belong to industries that have not been severely impacted by the pandemic. Originality/value This study has two important contributions. First, this study provides contemporary evidence of corporate disclosure of firms and their stakeholder-oriented actions on Twitter in response to the COVID-19 pandemic during the initial outbreak period. Second, it reveals insights into what characteristics drive firms to engage in costly corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities, and promote them on social media, in a period characterized by high economic uncertainty.","Baboukardos, D.; Gaia, S.; She, C.

We aimed to investigate the effects of physical distance, face masks, and eye protection on virus transmission in health-care and non-health-care (eg, community) settings. METHODS: We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the optimum distance for avoiding person-to-person virus transmission and to assess the use of face masks and eye protection to prevent transmission of viruses. We obtained data for SARS-CoV-2 and the betacoronaviruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome, and Middle East respiratory syndrome from 21 standard WHO-specific and COVID-19-specific sources. We searched these data sources from database inception to May 3, 2020, with no restriction by language, for comparative studies and for contextual factors of acceptability, feasibility, resource use, and equity. We screened records, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias in duplicate. We did frequentist and Bayesian meta-analyses and random-effects meta-regressions. We rated the certainty of evidence according to Cochrane methods and the GRADE approach. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020177047. FINDINGS: Our search identified 172 observational studies across 16 countries and six continents, with no randomised controlled trials and 44 relevant comparative studies in health-care and non-health-care settings (n=25â697 patients). Transmission of viruses was lower with physical distancing of 1 m or more, compared with a distance of less than 1 m (n=10â736, pooled adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0·18, 95% CI 0·09 to 0·38; risk difference [RD] -10·2%, 95% CI -11·5 to -7·5; moderate certainty); protection was increased as distance was lengthened (change in relative risk [RR] 2·02 per m; pinteraction=0·041; moderate certainty). Face mask use could result in a large reduction in risk of infection (n=2647; aOR 0·15, 95% CI 0·07 to 0·34, RD -14·3%, -15·9 to -10·7; low certainty), with stronger associations with N95 or similar respirators compared with disposable surgical masks or similar (eg, reusable 12-16-layer cotton masks; pinteraction=0·090; posterior probability >95%, low certainty). Eye protection also was associated with less infection (n=3713; aOR 0·22, 95% CI 0·12 to 0·39, RD -10·6%, 95% CI -12·5 to -7·7; low certainty). Unadjusted studies and subgroup and sensitivity analyses showed similar findings. INTERPRETATION: The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis support physical distancing of 1 m or more and provide quantitative estimates for models and contact tracing to inform policy. Optimum use of face masks, respirators, and eye protection in public and health-care settings should be informed by these findings and contextual factors. Robust randomised trials are needed to better inform the evidence for these interventions, but this systematic appraisal of currently best available evidence might inform interim guidance.

Second, to suppress the influence of occlusion, a \underline{R}egion-inspired \underline{R}elation \underline{R}easoning \underline{N}etwork (\textbf{RRRN}) is proposed to model relations between various facial regions. RRRN consists of a backbone network, the Region-Inspired (\textbf{RI}) module and Relation Reasoning (\textbf{RR}) module. More specifically, the backbone network aims at extracting feature representations from different facial regions, RI module computing an adaptive weight from the region itself based on attention mechanism with respect to the unobstructedness and importance for suppressing the influence of occlusion, and RR module exploiting the progressive interactions among these regions by performing graph convolutions. Experiments are conducted on handout-database evaluation and composite database evaluation tasks of MEGC 2018 protocol. Experimental results show that RRRN can significantly explore the importance of facial regions and capture the cooperative complementary relationship of facial regions for MER. The results also demonstrate RRRN outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, especially on occlusion, and RRRN acts more robust to occlusion.","Mao, Qirong; Zhou, Ling; Zheng, Wenming; Shao, Xiuyan; Huang, Xiaohua",,572,16

WGS has been a crucial approach in studying the evolution and genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in the ongoing pandemic, and while an exceptional number of SARS-CoV-2 complete genomes have since been submitted to GISAID and NCBI, there is a scarcity of data from Malaysia. This study aims to report new Malaysian lineages responsible for the sustained spikes in COVID-19 cases during the third wave of the pandemic. Patients whose nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were confirmed positive by real-time RT-PCR with Ct-value < 25 were chosen for WGS. The 10 SARS-CoV-2 isolates obtained were then sequenced, characterized and analyzed, including 1356 sequences of the dominant lineages of D614G variant currently circulating throughout Malaysia. The prevalence of clade GH and G formed strong ground of the discovery of two Malaysian lineages that caused sustained spikes of cases locally. Statistical analysis on the association of gender and age group with Malaysian lineages revealed a significant association (p < 0.05). Phylogenetic analysis revealed dispersion of 41 lineages, for which 22 lineages are still active. Mutational analysis observed unique G1223C missense mutation in Transmembrane Domain of Spike protein.

At first, it may seem that leaving medical school admissions partly to chance could erode autonomy and meritocracy. Yet our current system for selecting medical students is strained by a limited predictive ability. In the search for good doctors, we lack meaningful, quantifiable, and comparable criteria. Partial or weighted admissions lotteries can offer us an escape. They have the potential to reduce mental and financial burdens on both applicants and medical schools, avoiding an overemphasis on marginal differences between applicants. Lotteries are also a simple way to address persistent admissions disparities by being truly non-discriminatory. At the very least, lotteries represent a useful benchmark against which we can rigorously compare current and future selection methods.","Mazer, Benjamin L",Med Teach,572,24

METHODS: Two series of consecutive patients with chagasic megaesophagus treated surgically were analized in two different time periods, between 1955 and 1962 (n=147) and between 1988 and1998 (n=100). The age, duration of disphagia and the stage of the disease were correlated to the type of surgical procedure. The degree of megaesophagus was defined radiologically. RESULTS: There was a reduction in the number of patients, an increase in the median age and a reduction in the duration of disphagia in the second time period. During the first period, ressectional procedures were more common, while cardiomiotomy predominated in the second. CONCLUSIONS: The profile of the patients with chagasic megaesophagus, treated at the HCFMRP-USP, has changed along the years, the main change being earlier stages of the disease.

To test this hypothesis, we analyzed whether sphingosine regulates the infection of cultured and freshly isolated ex vivohuman epithelial cells with pseudoviral particles expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike (pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike) that served as a bona fide system mimicking SARS-CoV-2 infection. We demonstrate that exogenously applied sphingosine suspended in 0.9% NaCl prevents cellular infection with pp-SARS-CoV-2 spike. Pre-treatment of cultured Vero epithelial cells or freshly isolated human nasal epithelial cells with low concentrations of sphingosine prevented adhesion of and infection with pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that sphingosine binds to ACE2, the cellular receptor of SARS-CoV-2, and prevents the interaction of the receptor binding domain of the viral spike protein with ACE2.

The diterpenoid ent-11α-hydroxy-15-oxo-kaur-16-en-19-oic acid (11αOH-KA) is the major ingredient in the extract and has wide-spectrum biological activities, such as antitumor and antimelanogenic activities, as well as anti-inflammatory activity. However, the physical and biological properties of this compound as an antioxidant or antiaging agent have not been reported yet. Methods: In addition to in vitro assays, we monitored antioxidative and antiaging signals in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (yeast) and mouse melanoma B16F10 cells. Results: A. lavenia water and chloroform fractions showed antioxidant properties in vitro. The A. lavenia extracts and 11αOH-KA conferred resistance to H2O2to S. pombe and B16F10 cells and extended the yeast lifespan in a concentration-dependent manner. These materials maintained the yeast mitochondrial activity, even in a high-glucose medium, and induced an antioxidant gene program, the transcriptional factor pap1+and its downstream ctt1+. Accordingly, 11αOH-KA activated the antioxidative transcription factor NF-E2-related factor 2, NRF2, the mammalian ortholog of pap1+, in B16F10 cells, which was accompanied by enhanced hemeoxygenase expression levels. These results suggest that 11αOH-KA and A. lavenia extracts may protect yeast and mammalian cells from oxidative stress and aging. Finally, we hope that these materials could be helpful in treating COVID-19 patients, because A. lavenia extracts and NRF2 activators have been reported to alleviate the symptoms of pneumonia in model animals.","Batubara, Irmanida; Astuti, Rika Indri; Prastya, Muhammad Eka; Ilmiawati, Auliya; Maeda, Miwa; Suzuki, Mayu; Hamamoto, Akie; Takemori, Hiroshi",Antioxidants,572,24

Such Big Data opens unprecedented opportunities for investigating cognitive phenomena like perception, personality and information diffusion but requires suitable interpretable frameworks. Since social media data come from users' minds, worthy candidates for this challenge are cognitive networks, models of cognition giving structure to mental conceptual associations. This work outlines how cognitive network science can open new, quantitative ways for understanding cognition through online media, like: (i) reconstructing how users semantically and emotionally frame events with contextual knowledge unavailable to machine learning, (ii) investigating conceptual salience/prominence through knowledge structure in social discourse; (iii) studying users' personality traits like openness-to-experience, curiosity, and creativity through language in posts; (iv) bridging cognitive/emotional content and social dynamics via multilayer networks comparing the mindsets of influencers and followers. These advancements combine cognitive-, network- and computer science to understand cognitive mechanisms in both digital and real-world settings but come with limitations concerning representativeness, individual variability and data integration. Such aspects are discussed along the ethical implications of manipulating socio-cognitive data. In the future, reading cognitions through networks and social media can expose cognitive biases amplified by online platforms and relevantly inform policy making, education and markets about massive, complex cognitive trends.","Stella, Massimo",,572,1

Despite this, there has been a rush to procure and self-medicate with hydroxychloroquine, which has been addressed by the National Task Force. The WHO and the FDA have not found adequate evidence to recommend any specific medication for the treatment of Covid-19. While further evidence is awaited, including from trials registered with the FDA and the ICMR, it is recommended that the administration of hydroxychloroquine for chemo-prophylaxis be considered on a case by case basis with monitoring by a registered medical practitioner including electrocardiography (ECG). The potential for retinal and cardiac toxicity must also be borne in mind. It is further recommended that a public advisory regarding the need for caution in chemo-prophylaxis be made available in the public domain.

While the majority of patients were considered mild, critically ill patients involving respiratory failure and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome are not uncommon, which could result death. We hypothesized that cytokine storm is associated with severe outcome. We enrolled 102 COVID-19 patients who were admitted to Renmin Hospital (Wuhan, China). All patients were classified into moderate, severe and critical groups according to their symptoms. 45 control samples of healthy volunteers were also included. Inflammatory cytokines and C-Reactive Protein (CRP) profiles of serum samples were analyzed by specific immunoassays. Results showed that COVID-19 patients have higher serum level of cytokines (TNF-&#945;, IFN-Î³, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10) and CRP than control individuals. Within COVID-19 patients, serum IL-6 and IL-10 levels are significantly higher in critical group (n = 17) than in moderate (n = 42) and severe (n = 43) group. The levels of IL-10 is positively correlated with CRP amount (r = 0.41, P < 0.01). Using univariate logistic regression analysis, IL-6 and IL-10 are found to be predictive of disease severity and receiver operating curve analysis could further confirm this result (AUC = 0.841, 0.822 respectively). Our result indicated higher levels of cytokine storm is associated with more severe disease development. Among them, IL-6 and IL-10 can be used as predictors for fast diagnosis of patients with higher risk of disease deterioration. Given the high levels of cytokines induced by SARS-CoV-2, treatment to reduce inflammation-related lung damage is critical.","Han, Huan; Ma, Qingfeng; Li, Cong; Liu, Rui; Zhao, Li; Wang, Wei; Zhang, Pingan; Liu, Xinghui; Gao, Guosheng; Liu, Fang; Jiang, Yingan; Cheng, Xiaoming; Zhu, Chengliang; Xia, Yuchen",Emerg Microbes Infect,572,16

The opioid cascade describes the current status of the treatment system, where only a fraction of people with OUD initiate effective medication treatment for OUD (MOUD), and of those only a fraction is retained in treatment. Regulatory changes-such as availability of larger take-home supplies of methadone and buprenorphine initiated via telemedicine (e.g., no initial in person visit; telemedicine buprenorphine permitted across state lines)-could modify the cascade, by reducing the burden and increasing the attractiveness, availability, and feasibility of MOUD both for people with OUD and for providers. We review examples of more liberal MOUD regimens, including the implementation of buprenorphine in France in the 1990s, primary care-based methadone in Canada, and low-threshold buprenorphine models. Research is needed to document whether new models implemented in the U.S. in the wake of COVID-19 are successful, and whether safety concerns, such as diversion and misuse, emerge. We discuss barriers to implementation, including racial and ethnic health disparities, and lack of knowledge and reluctance among potential providers of MOUD. We suggest that the urgency and public spiritedness of the response to COVID-19 be harnessed to make gains on the opioid cascade, inspiring prescribers, health systems, and communities to embrace the delivery of MOUD to meet the needs of an increasingly vulnerable population.","Nunes, Edward V; Levin, Frances R; Reilly, Muredach P; El-Bassel, Nabila",J Subst Abuse Treat,572,1

The sample consisted of 155 adolescents (xÌ = 14.63, SD = 2.04) and one of their parents (N = 155). The results showed that after controlling for adolescents' gender and emotion regulation, parental cyberchondriasis and anxiety accounted for an important variance in adolescents' anxiety. Especially higher parental anxiety and compulsion were associated with higher anxiety, whereas higher distress was associated with lower anxiety. Besides, two dimensions of cyberchondriasis, compulsion, and distress, together with adolescent anxiety, predicted parental anxiety during COVID-19. While compulsion was negatively associated with anxiety, distress, and adolescent anxiety were positively associated with it. The dimensions of cyberchondriasis affected anxiety differently among adolescents and their parents. The results were discussed in terms of the implications for intervention from the ecological viewpoint.","Akgül, Gülendam; Atalan Ergin, Derya",Curr Psychol,572,26

These models rely on learning powerful representations of MOOC entities. However, they suffer from the problem of scarce expert label data. To overcome this problem, we propose to learn pre-trained representations of MOOC entities using abundant unlabeled data from the structure of MOOCs which can directly be applied to the downstream tasks. While existing pre-training methods have been successful in NLP areas as they learn powerful textual representation, their models do not leverage the richer information about MOOC entities. This richer information includes the graph relationship between the lectures, concepts, and courses along with the domain knowledge about the complexity of a concept. We develop MOOCRep, a novel method based on Transformer language model trained with two pre-training objectives : 1) graph-based objective to capture the powerful signal of entities and relations that exist in the graph, and 2) domain-oriented objective to effectively incorporate the complexity level of concepts. Our experiments reveal that MOOCRep's embeddings outperform state-of-the-art representation learning methods on two tasks important for education community, concept pre-requisite prediction and lecture recommendation.","Pandey, Shalini; Srivastava, Jaideep",,572,30

The accelerated research activity in the development of diagnostic kits for SARS-CoV-2 is in progress for the rapid sequencing of various strains of SARS-CoV-2. A notable reduction in air pollutants (NO2 and PM2.5) has been observed worldwide, but high air polluted cities showed intense mortalities in COVID-19 affected areas. The use of health safety equipment halted transportation, and work-from-home policy drastically impacted the quantity of solid and hazardous wastes management services. Wastewater appeared as another mode of enteric transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, wastewater-based surveillance could act as a mode of the data source to track the virus's community spread. The pandemic also had a substantial socio-economic impact (health budget, industrial manufacturing, job loss, and unemployment) and further aggravated the countries' economic burden.","Suthar, Surindra; Das, Sukanya; Nagpure, Ajay; Madhurantakam, Chaithanya; Tiwari, Satya Brat; Gahlot, Pallavi; Tyagi, Vinay Kumar",J Environ Manage,572,16

Individuals' perceptions of the impact of weather can inform their adherence to public health guidelines; however, there is no measure of their perceptions. We quantified Twitter users' perceptions of the effect of weather and analyzed how they evolved with respect to real-world events and time. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected 166,005 English tweets posted between January 23 and June 22, 2020 and employed machine learning/natural language processing techniques to filter for relevant tweets, classify them by the type of effect they claimed, and identify topics of discussion. RESULTS: We identified 28,555 relevant tweets and estimate that 40.4 % indicate uncertainty about weather's impact, 33.5 % indicate no effect, and 26.1 % indicate some effect. We tracked changes in these proportions over time. Topic modeling revealed major latent areas of discussion. DISCUSSION: There is no consensus among the public for weather's potential impact. Earlier months were characterized by tweets that were uncertain of weather's effect or claimed no effect; later, the portion of tweets claiming some effect of weather increased. Tweets claiming no effect of weather comprised the largest class by June. Major topics of discussion included comparisons to influenza's seasonality, President Trump's comments on weather's effect, and social distancing. CONCLUSION: We exhibit a research approach that is effective in measuring population perceptions and identifying misconceptions, which can inform public health communications.","Gupta, Marichi; Bansal, Aditya; Jain, Bhav; Rochelle, Jillian; Oak, Atharv; Jalali, Mohammad S",Int J Med Inform,572,16

Otorhinolaryngologists deal intimately with pathologies of the head and neck region and upper respiratory tract and have been reported as a vulnerable group of healthcare workers who may be more susceptible to COVID-19 nosocomial infection. METHODS: In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of the adaptations of Singapore's largest tertiary Otorhinolaryngology department during the COVID-19 outbreak. This was undertaken via an evidence-based approach. The relevant medical literature and evidence underlying our adaptations are highlighted. RESULTS: A four-pronged strategy including (1) personnel segregation, (2) triaging and decantment, (3) use of personal protective equipment and (4) changes in clinical practice was employed. The strategy was bolstered by drawing upon a collective learnt experience from the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak. CONCLUSION: A rigorous framework which can preserve operationality while navigating the heightened risks during this outbreak is critical for every Otorhinolaryngology department. As the pandemic continues to evolve and more scientific reports of this disease are made available, approaches will need to be morphed.","See, Anna; Go, Lih Khuang; Teo, Constance E H; Teo, Neville Wei Yang; Toh, Song Tar",Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol,572,16

In this paper, we propose a model predictive approach for the constrained control of a nonlinear compartmental model that captures the key dynamical properties of COVID-19. The control design uses the discrete-time version of the epidemic model, and it is able to handle complex, possibly time-dependent constraints, logical relations between model variables and multiple predefined discrete levels of interventions. A state observer is also constructed for the computation of non-measured variables from the number of hospitalized patients. Five control scenarios with different cost functions and constraints are studied through numerical simulations, including an output feedback configuration with uncertain parameters. It is visible from the results that, depending on the cost function associated with different policy aims, the obtained controls correspond to mitigation and suppression strategies, and the constructed control inputs are similar to real-life government responses. The results also clearly show the key importance of early intervention, the continuous tracking of the susceptible population and that of future work in determining the true costs of restrictive control measures and their quantitative effects.","Péni, Tamás; Csutak, Balázs; Szederkényi, Gábor; Röst, Gergely",Nonlinear Dyn,572,16

The spread of COVID-19 in population and regions is a typical geographical process, which is worth discussing from the geographical perspective. This paper focuses on Shandong province, which has a high incidence, though the first Chinese confirmed case was reported from Hubei province. Based on the data of reported confirmed cases and the detailed information of cases collected manually, we used text analysis, mathematical statistics and spatial analysis to reveal the demographic characteristics of confirmed cases and the spatio-temporal evolution process of the epidemic, and to explore the comprehensive mechanism of epidemic evolution and prevention and control. The results show that: (1) the incidence rate of COVID-19 in Shandong is 0.76/100,000. The majority of confirmed cases are old and middle-aged people who are infected by the intra-province diffusion, followed by young and middle-aged people who are infected outside the province. (2) Up to February 5, the number of daily confirmed cases shows a trend of ""rapid increase before slowing down"", among which, the changes of age and gender are closely related to population migration, epidemic characteristics and intervention measures. (3) Affected by the regional economy and population, the spatial distribution of the confirmed cases is obviously unbalanced, with the cluster pattern of ""high-low"" and ""low-high"". (4) The evolution of the migration pattern, affected by the geographical location of Wuhan and Chinese traditional culture, is dominated by ""cross-provincial"" and ""intra-provincial"" direct flow, and generally shows the trend of ""southwest â northeast"". Finally, combined with the targeted countermeasures of ""source-flow-sink"", the comprehensive mechanism of COVID-19 epidemic evolution and prevention and control in Shandong is revealed. External and internal prevention and control measures are also figured out.","Shi, Jinlong; Gao, Xing; Xue, Shuyan; Li, Fengqing; Nie, Qifan; Lv, Yangfan; Wang, Jiaobei; Xu, Tingting; Du, Guoxu; Li, Gang",Sci Rep,572,26

With multilingual populations increasing worldwide, patients frequently need to be tested in more than one language. There is still no reliable testing instrument, as the available batteries have been developed for specific languages. Heterogeneity in the selection criteria for stimuli leads to differences, for example, in the size, color, image quality, and even names associated with pictures, making direct cross-linguistic comparisons difficult. Here we present MULTIMAP, a new multilingual picture naming test for mapping eloquent areas during awake brain surgery. Recognizing that the distinction between nouns and verbs is necessary for detailed and precise language mapping, MULTIMAP consists of a database of 218 standardized color pictures representing both objects and actions. These images have been tested for name agreement with speakers of Spanish, Basque, Catalan, Italian, French, English, German, Mandarin Chinese, and Arabic, and have been controlled for relevant linguistic features in cross-language combinations. The MULTIMAP test for objects and verbs represents an alternative to the Oral Denomination 80 (DO 80) monolingual pictorial set currently used in language mapping, providing an open-source, standardized set of up-to-date pictures, where relevant linguistic variables across several languages have been taken into account in picture creation and selection.","Gisbert-Muñoz, Sandra; Quiñones, Ileana; Amoruso, Lucia; Timofeeva, Polina; Geng, Shuang; Boudelaa, Sami; Pomposo, Iñigo; Gil-Robles, Santiago; Carreiras, Manuel",,572,10

To investigate possible mediators of pH-dependence, pKa calculations have been made on a set of structures for spike protein ectodomain and fragments from SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. Dominating a heat map of the aggregated predictions, three histidine residues in S2 are consistently predicted as destabilizing in pre-fusion (all three) and post-fusion (two of the three) structures. Other predicted features include the more moderate energetics of surface salt-bridge interactions and sidechain-mainchain interactions. Two aspartic acid residues in partially buried salt-bridges (D290-R273 and R355-D398) have pKas that are calculated to be elevated and destabilizing in more open forms of the spike trimer. These aspartic acids are most stabilized in a tightly closed conformation that has been observed when linoleic acid is bound, and which also affects the interactions of D614. The D614G mutation is known to modulate the balance of closed to open trimer. It is suggested that D398 in particular contributes to a pH-dependence of the open/closed equilibrium, potentially coupled to the effects of linoleic acid binding and D614G mutation, and possibly also A570D mutation. These observations are discussed in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, mutagenesis studies, and other human coronaviruses.","Warwicker, Jim",Brief Bioinform,572,23

In recent times, probiotics have shown to mitigate numerous health challenges, including animal and human infectious diseases through competitive exclusion or antagonism of pathogens, modulation of host-microbiota, secretion of antimicrobial compounds and stimulation of immune responses. The presentation of COVID-19 as severe respiratory distress leading to gastrointestinal tract involvement could be mitigated through probiotics administration which beneficially modulates the microbiota and immune responses with an attendant reduction in morbidities, hence curtailing the COVID-19 pandemic.","Reuben, Rine Christopher; Makut, Makwin Danladi; Adogo, Lillian Yami",Pan Afr Med J,572,24

This is due to the highly infectious nature of the disease and its possibility to cause pneumonia induced death in approximately 6.89% of infected individuals (data until 27 April 2020). The pathogen causing COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is believed to be originated from the Wuhan Province in China. Unfortunately, an effective and approved vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 virus is still not available, making the situation more dangerous and currently available medical care futile. This unmet medical need thus requires significant and very urgent research attention to develop an effective vaccine to address the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In this review, the state-of-the-art drug design strategies against the virus are critically summarized including exploitations of novel drugs and potentials of repurposed drugs. The applications of nanochemistry and general nanotechnology was also discussed to give the status of nanodiagnostic systems for COVID-19.","Sivasankarapillai, Vishnu Sankar; Pillai, Akhilash M.; Rahdar, Abbas; Sobha, Anumol P.; Das, Sabya Sachi; Mitropoulos, Athanasios C.; Mokarrar, Mahboobeh Heidari; Kyzas, George Z.",Nanomaterials,572,16

STUDY DESIGN: Oro-nasopharyngeal swab and saliva samples were collected from all patients simultaneously in the early stage of COVID-19. Viral loads were determined by extracting viral RNAs from saliva samples of patients whose ONP swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR. The demographic information, comorbidities, cycle threshold values, and one-month clinical courses were recorded and compared. RESULTS: The patients' clinical course was evaluated for one month; 56 % of patients had mild disease, 26.4 % had moderate disease, 9.6 % had severe disease, and 8% had a critical/mortal disease. The average cycle threshold values of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva and ONP samples were measured as 22.28 and 24.19, respectively. Cycle threshold value of saliva was found to be significant in predicting disease severity (Eta coefficient 0.979). A statistically significant relationship was found between the disease's severity and the mean of ONP samples' Ct-values (p < 0.05). Gender, age, body mass index, and co-morbidities were compared with the severity of the disease; no statistically significant difference was found. CONCLUSION: Viral load detected in saliva in the early period of COVID-19 infection may have a prognostic value in showing the disease's course in patients over 45-year-old.

Many have implemented nationwide stringent control to avoid overburdening the health care system. This has paralyzed economic and social activities and may continue to do so until the large-scale availability of a vaccine. We propose an alternative exit strategy to develop herd immunity in a predictable and controllable way: a phased lift of control. This means that successive parts of the country (e.g. provinces) stop stringent control, and COVID-19-related IC admissions are distributed over the country as a whole. Importantly, vulnerable individuals need to be shielded until herd immunity has developed in their area. We explore the characteristics and duration of this strategy using a novel individual-based model for geographically stratified transmission of COVID-19 in a country. The model predicts that individuals will have to experience stringent control for about 14 months on average, but this duration may be almost halved by further developments (more IC beds, better treatments). Clearly, implementation of this strategy would have a profound impact on individuals and society, and should therefore be considered carefully by various other disciplines (e.g. health systems, ethics, economics) before actual implementation.","de Vlas, Sake J; Coffeng, Luc E",Sci Rep,572,20

We found the propagation of droplets and aerosols highly affected by this condition. The spread of respiratory droplets by the action of sneezing is characterized by the dynamics of two groups of droplets of different sizes: Larger droplets (300-900 µm) have a ballistic trajectory and can be spread up to 5 m, while a cloud of smaller droplets (100-200 µm) can be transported and dispersed at longer distances up to 18 m by the action of the turbulent airflow. In relation to the spread of exhaled aerosols during respiration, these remain in the air for long periods of time. In the presence of intense or moderate airflow, this set of particles follow airflow streamlines, and thus their propagation is directly determined by the air velocity field. Given the scientific evidence, these results should be considered in public debate about the aerodynamic dispersion characteristics of scenarios where social interactions occur and about the measures to mitigate the spread of the virus. © 2021 by the authors.

Several studies found a significant association of frailty with COVID-19 severity to support the evidence for the application of frailty assessment. However, there were contradictory results in other studies. Thus we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize the current studies to investigate impact of frailty on COVID-19 outcomes and provide evidence-based decisions in clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to synthesize the current studies to investigate impact of frailty on COVID-19 outcomes and provide evidence-based decisions in clinical practice. DESIGN: A systematic review and Meta-analysis of 16 cohort studies. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic retrieving for potential literature was conducted in several public electronic databases, including Medline(OvidSP), EMBASE, Pubmed and Chinese databases(China National Knowledge Infrastructure,Wanfang and Weipu) on August 1, 2020.The literature research was updated on October 26, 2020. Newcastle Ottawa Scale for cohort studies was used for quality assessment. RevMan (Version 5.3) and Stata 14.0 were used to synthesize the pooled effects. RESULTS: According to the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, sixteen studies of 4324 patients were included in the final analysis. Frailty was significantly associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality among patients with COVID-19, with pooled adjusted odds ratios of 1.81 (95% confidence intervals:1.48,2.21, I2=87.0%, P<0.001). The result was consistent in stratified analysis to according to age, patient source, definitions of frailty, study quality, and adjustment method. Frailty was significant associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 severity, admission to intensive care unit, application of invasive mechanical ventilation, long-length stay. CONCLUSIONS: In this meta-analysis, we found frailty was significantly associated with an increased risk of clinical adverse events (all- cause mortality, COVID-19 severity, admission to the intensive care unit, application of invasive mechanical ventilation, long-length stay). Given the epidemic of COVID-19 and shortage of medical resources, paying more attention to screening frailty would contribute to disease management and resource allocation among patients with COVID-19.","Yang, Y; Luo, K; Jiang, Y; Yu, Q; Huang, X; Wang, J; Liu, N; Huang, P",J Nutr Health Aging,572,16

The successes of mobility interventions demonstrate how policies can help limit the person-to-person interactions that are essential to infection. With significant community spread, experts predict this virus will continue to be a threat until safe and effective vaccines have been developed and widely deployed. We aim to understand mobility changes during the first major quarantine period in the United States, measured via mobile device tracking, by assessing how people changed their behavior in response to policies and to weather. Here, we show that consistent national messaging was associated with consistent national behavioral change, regardless of local policy. Furthermore, although human behavior did vary with outdoor air temperature, these variations were not associated with variations in a proxy for the rate of encounters between people. The independence of encounters and temperatures suggests that weather-related behavioral changes will, in many cases, be of limited relevance for SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics. Both of these results are encouraging for the potential of clear national messaging to help contain any future pandemics, and possibly to help contain COVID-19.","Wu, Yihan; Mooring, Todd A; Linz, Marianna",Proc.

Thus, we aimed to investigate whether in the situation of an imminent coronavirus pandemic, people would still perceive themselves as being less exposed to the disease than others. Methods: Survey studies were conducted to examine the level of unrealistic optimism. Participants (n = 171, 67.3% of women) in a subjective way judged the risk of their coronavirus infection and the likelihood that this would happen to an average student of the same sex from their class. The survey was conducted in three waves: prior to the announcement of the first case of coronavirus (2-3 March), immediately after that announcement (5-6 March), and a few days later (9-10 March). Results: We showed that women estimated the chances of being infected as significantly higher (M = 4.52, SD = 2.079; t = 2.387; p = 0.018; Cohen's d = 0.393) than men (M = 3.71, SD = 2.042). The phenomenon of unrealistic optimism was observed especially in men (as compared to other male participants) as it appeared in all three measures (M (you) = 3.95 vs. M (other male student) = 4.63; M = 3.71 vs. M = 4.68, and M = 4.46 vs. M = 5.38 in phase one, two, and three, respectively; p 0.006 for all comparison), but also in women in the last two measures (M(you) = 4.55 vs. M (other female student) = 4.95, and M = 4.99 vs. M = 5.38 in phase 2 and 3, respectively; p 0.012 for both comparisons). Conclusions: The study revealed a fairly general occurrence of unrealistic optimism, which was mainly observed in men as it appeared in all three measures, but also in women in the last two measures. This result is important for health experts who are responsible for making people comply with regulations concerning social distancing, putting masks on to stop infection, and staying at home. It is possible that unrealistically optimistic people will behave much less in line with the aforementioned recommendations, causing coronavirus to spread widely.","Dolinski, Dariusz; Dolinska, Barbara; Zmaczynska-Witek, Barbara; Banach, Maciej; Kulesza, Wojciech",,572,24

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective observational study. Intermediate-to-high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) was evaluated. Data from genetic analyses were included in a database along with clinicopathological variables of interest. RESULTS: Seventy-four patients. Twenty-five (33.8%) recurred and 3 (4.1%) progressed. Median time to recurrence: 8 months (5.7-12.7). Median time to progression: 14 months (P75: 12). Mutation distribution: KRAS codon 12: one patient (1.4%), BAT25: five patients (6.8%), BAT-26: four patients (5.4%), and D2S123: 6 patients (8.1%). Arg72Pro polymorphism: 50 patients (67.6%) exhibited homozygous mutations, 23 (31.1%) were heterozygous, and 1 patient (1.4%) did not present the mutation. We found an association between presence of MSI at BAT26 and female sex (p < 0.05) and tumor stage and the TP53 Arg72Pro polymorphism. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) was significantly associated with presence of MSI at D2S123, with a HR of 5.44 for patients presenting the mutation (95% CI 1.83-16.16). On multivariate analysis, we found a statistically significant increase in risk of recurrence among patients with MSI at D2S123 (HR 5.15; p < 0.05) and more than 2 previous transurethral bladder resections (TURBs) (HR 5.07; p < 0.05) adjusted for tumor stage and grade. Harrell's concordance index revealed an accuracy of 0.74 (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: An association was found between presence BAT26 MSI and female sex, Arg72Pro polymorphism with tumor stage and D2S123 and more than 2 TUR procedures were associated with RFS adjusted to tumor stage and grade.","Garde-García, H; Redondo-González, E; Maestro-de Las Casas, M; Fernández-Pérez, C; Moreno-Sierra, J",Clin. transl. oncol.

We investigated changes in fecal microbiomes of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection during hospitalization and associations with severity and fecal shedding of virus. METHODS: We performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing analyses of fecal samples from 15 patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hong Kong, from February 5 through March 17, 2020. Fecal samples were collected 2 or 3 times per week from time of hospitalization until discharge; disease was categorized as mild (no radiographic evidence of pneumonia), moderate (pneumonia was present), severe (respiratory rate &#8805;30/min, or oxygen saturation &#8804;93% when breathing ambient air), or critical (respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, shock, or organ failure requiring intensive care). We compared microbiome data with those from 6 subjects with community-acquired pneumonia and 15 healthy individuals (controls). We assessed gut microbiome profiles in association with disease severity and changes in fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Patients with COVID-19 had significant alterations in fecal microbiomes compared with controls, characterized by enrichment of opportunistic pathogens and depletion of beneficial commensals, at time of hospitalization and at all timepoints during hospitalization. Depleted symbionts and gut dysbiosis persisted even after clearance of SARS-CoV-2 (determined from throat swabs) and resolution of respiratory symptoms. The baseline abundance of Coprobacillus, Clostridium ramosum, and Clostridium hathewayi correlated with COVID-19 severity; there was an inverse correlation between abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (an anti-inflammatory bacterium) and disease severity. Over the course of hospitalization, Bacteroides dorei, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides massiliensis, and Bacteroides ovatus, which downregulate expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in murine gut, correlated inversely with SARS-CoV-2 load in fecal samples from patients. CONCLUSIONS: In a pilot study of 15 patients with COVID-19, we found persistent alterations in the fecal microbiome during the time of hospitalization, compared with controls. Fecal microbiota alterations were associated with fecal levels of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 severity. Strategies to alter the intestinal microbiota might reduce disease severity.","Zuo, Tao; Zhang, Fen; Lui, Grace C Y; Yeoh, Yun Kit; Li, Amy Y L; Zhan, Hui; Wan, Yating; Chung, Arthur C K; Cheung, Chun Pan; Chen, Nan; Lai, Christopher K C; Chen, Zigui; Tso, Eugene Y K; Fung, Kitty S C; Chan, Veronica; Ling, Lowell; Joynt, Gavin; Hui, David S C; Chan, Francis K L; Chan, Paul K S; Ng, Siew C",Gastroenterology,572,14

Previous models for this coevolving usually introduced the dependence between these two processes by setting a lower but time-independent infection rate for individuals with awareness. However, a realistic scenario can be more complicated, as individual vigilance and the adopted protective measures may depend on the extent of the discussion on the disease, whereas individuals may be irrational or lack relevant knowledge, leading to improper measures being taken. These can introduce a time-varying dependence between epidemic dynamics and awareness prevalence and may weaken the effect of spreading awareness in containing a pandemic. To better understand this effect, we introduce a nonlinear dependence of the epidemic infection rate on awareness prevalence, focusing on the effect of different forms of dependence on the coevolving dynamics. We demonstrate that a positive correlation between vigilance and awareness prevalence can enhance the effect of information spreading in suppressing epidemics. However, this enhancement can be weakened if some individuals are irrational. Our results demonstrate the importance of rational behavior in the strategy of containing epidemics by propagation of disease information.","Zhang, Yixiao Lu Xing Cui Ni Tang Jingtai Zhang Xiyun",Complexity,572,1

In India, the countrywide lockdown has been imposed since 24th march 2020, and has got multiple extensions with different guidelines for each phase. Among various models of epidemiology, we use the SIR(D) model to analyze the extent to which this multi-phased lockdown has been active in 'flattening the curve' and lower the threat. Analyzing the effect of lockdown on the infection may provide a better insight into the evolution of epidemic while implementing the quarantine procedures as well as improving the healthcare facilities. For accurate modelling, incorporating various parameters along with sophisticated computational facilities are required. Parallel to SIRD modelling, we tend to compare it with the Ising model and derive a quantum circuit that incorporates the rate of infection and rate of recovery, etc as its parameters. The probabilistic plots obtained from the circuit qualitatively resemble the shape of the curve for the spread of Coronavirus. We also demonstrate how the curve flattens when the lockdown is imposed. This kind of quantum computational approach can be useful in reducing space and time complexities of a huge amount of information related to the epidemic.","Padhi, Anshuman; Pradhan, Sudev; Sahoo, Pragna Paramita; Suresh, Kalyani; Behera, Bikash K; Panigrahi, Prasanta K",Sci Rep,572,26

The infection, transmitted by 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCov), was first discovered in December 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and then rapidly spread worldwide. Italy was early and severely involved, with a critical spread of the infection and a very high number of victims. Person-to-person spread mainly occurs via respiratory droplets and contact. The median incubation period is 5 days. The spectrum of respiratory symptoms may range from mild to severe, strictly depending on the age of the patient and the underlying comorbidities.In children COVID-19 related disease is less frequent and less aggressive. In Italy 1% of positive cases are under 18 years of age, and no deaths have been recorded before 29 years of age.

The study design was prospective, observational, and cross-sectional. The vessel densities (VD) of the superficial capillary plexus (SCP), deep capillary plexus (DCP), and retinal peripapillary capillary plexus (RPCP) were assessed using OCT-A in patients with ED and healthy subjects. All the participants were evaluated and scanned for systemic and hormonal disorders and those with ED also underwent penile Doppler ultrasonography (PDU). After recording the data, the participants were divided into three groups: organic ED, psychogenic ED, and healthy control. The relationships between the OCT-A parameters and other clinical findings were analyzed. The right eyes of 80 patients with ED and 40 healthy volunteers were evaluated in this study. Of the ED patients, 46 were included in the organic ED group according to the results of PDU. The VDs of DCP, SCP, and the temporal sector of RPCP were significantly lower in the organic ED group than the psychogenic ED and healthy control groups. The VDs of SCP and DCP were correlated with the peak systolic velocity of both left and right penile cavernous arteries. The VDs of DCP were also correlated with the left and right resistive indexes. In conclusion, the OCT-A data of SCP and especially DCP could be helpful in evaluating ED, and provide reliable information about the origin of the disease along with the other laboratory testing and penile vascular evaluation.","Yilmaz, Hayati; Gultekin, Mehmet Hamza; Yalcin, Ahmet",Int. j. impot. res,572,24

Nevertheless, community spread of COVID-19 has still occurred. We aimed to assess the settings where COVID-19 transmission occurred and determine the fraction of transmission events that occurred in settings where masks are not usually worn. METHODS: we reviewed detailed information provided by the Hong Kong Department of Health on local COVID-19 cases diagnosed up to 30 September 2020 to determine the most likely settings in which transmission occurred. We classified them in probably mask-on or mask-of and compared the prevalence of asymptomatic infections in these settings. RESULTS: among the 2425 cases (65.3%, 2425/3711) with information on transmission setting, 77.6% of the transmission occurred in household and social settings where face masks are not usually worn. Infections that occurred in mask-on settings were more likely to be asymptomatic (adjusted odds ratio 1.33; 95% confidence interval: 1.04, 1.68). CONCLUSIONS: we conclude that universal mask-wearing can reduce transmission, but transmission can continue to occur in settings where face masks are not usually worn. The higher proportion of asymptomatic cases in mask-on settings could be related to a milder disease presentation or earlier case detection.","Martín-Sánchez, Mario; Lim, Wey Wen; Yeung, Amy; Adam, Dillon C; Ali, Sheikh Taslim; Lau, Eric H Y; Wu, Peng; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Leung, Gabriel M; Cowling, Benjamin J",J Infect,572,16

These findings may help explain why after 30 years of proposed government obesity policies, obesity prevalence and health inequities still have not been successfully reduced. If policymakers address the issues identified in this analysis, population obesity could be tackled more successfully, which has added urgency given the COVID-19 pandemic. CONTEXT: In England, the majority of adults, and more than a quarter of children aged 2 to 15 years live with obesity or excess weight. From 1992 to 2020, even though the government published 14 obesity strategies in England, the prevalence of obesity has not been reduced. We aimed to determine whether such government strategies and policies have been fit for purpose regarding their strategic focus, nature, basis in theory and evidence, and implementation viability. METHOD: We undertook a mixed-methods study, involving a document review and analysis of government strategies either wholly or partially dedicated to tackling obesity in England. We developed a theory-based analytical framework, using content analysis and applied thematic analysis (ATA) to code all policies. Our interpretation drew on quantitative findings and thematic analysis. FINDINGS: We identified and analyzed 14 government strategies published from 1992 to 2020 containing 689 wide-ranging policies. Policies were largely proposed in a way that would be unlikely to lead to implementation; the majority were not interventionist and made high demands on individual agency, meaning that they relied on individuals to make behavior changes rather than shaping external influences, and are thus less likely to be effective or to reduce health inequalities. CONCLUSIONS: The government obesity strategies' failure to reduce the prevalence of obesity in England for almost 30 years may be due to weaknesses in the policies' design, leading to a lack of effectiveness, but they may also be due to failures of implementation and evaluation. These failures appear to have led to insufficient or no policy learning and governments proposing similar or identical policies repeatedly over many years. Governments should learn from their earlier policy failures. They should prioritize policies that make minimal demands on individuals and have the potential for population-wide reach so as to maximize their potential for equitable impacts. Policies should be proposed in ways that readily lead to implementation and evaluation.","Theis, Dolly R Z; White, Martin",Milbank q,572,29

Many pieces of evidence show that miRNAs affect the viral RNA replication and pathogenesis through direct binding to the RNA virus to mediate changes in the host transcriptome. Many previous studies have been studying the interaction between human cells' miRNA and viral RNA to predict many targets along the viral genome. In this work, via the miRDB database, we determined the target scores of predicted human miRNA to bind with the ss-RNA of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in general and its spike gene in specific. Our predicted miRNA targets of the ss-RNA of SARS-CoV-2 might destabilize the ss-RNA translation of SARS-CoV-2 that has been established by more than 80% of asymptomatic infected cases in Jordan due to host miRNA interactions. In respiratory epithelial cells, the high prediction scoring for miRNAs covers the RNA from 5' to 3' that explains successful antiviral defenses against ss-RNA of SARS-CoV-2 and might lead to new nucleotide deletion mechanisms. The exciting findings here that the nucleotide substitution 1841Aâ¯â¯>â¯â¯G at the viral genomic RNA level, which is an amino acid substation D614G at the spike protein level showed a change in the predicted miRNA sequence from hsa-miR-4793-5p to hsa-miR-3620-3p with an increase in the target score from 91 to 92.","Haddad, Hazem",,572,2

METHODS: This was a retrospective study in patients younger than 18 years of age with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and cancer diagnoses between April and September 2020. Demographic variables, laboratory, and radiologic findings and complications of each case were identified. A descriptive analysis was performed. RESULTS: A total of 33 patients were identified; the median age was 10 years. Fifteen patients (42%) were in chemotherapy at the time of the infection diagnosis, in two patients the chemotherapy protocol was permanently suspended. The most common symptom was fever in 20 patients (60%). Seven patients (21.2%) showed mild pneumonia, four patients (12.1%) severe pneumonia, and three cases (9.0%) were classified as critical. In the evaluated cohort, five patients (15.1%) died, and in two of those, death was caused by COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: Children with an oncologic disease, the search for COVID cases should be oriented to patients with fever, including febrile neutropenia, the presence of respiratory symptoms, and the search for epidemiologic contact. A higher frequency of complications and mortality attributed to COVID-19, two in pediatric oncohematologic patients was found.

For Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), the relationship between nasopharyngeal (NP) swab positivity, the development of antibodies against COVID-19, and clinical history are unclear. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Individuals who recovered from COVID-19 and volunteered to donate convalescent plasma (CP) were screened by NP swab PCR, responded to a questionnaire, and were tested for anti-COVID-19 antibodies. RESULTS: A proportion of 11.8% of individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by NP swab PCR greater than 14 days after the resolution of symptoms of active disease, including one donor who had asymptomatic disease and tested positive by NP swab 41 days after her initial diagnosis. Clinical history did not show a significant correlation with persistence of NP swab positivity. Also, NP swab positivity >14 days from symptom resolution did not correlate with anti-COVID-19 serology results. IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody strength correlated with hospitalization for COVID-19 using two different assays. Total anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibody strength correlated with time from symptom resolution to sample collection and symptom duration. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid is detectable long after the resolution of symptoms in a significant percentage of previously diagnosed individuals, which is important to consider when interpreting PCR swab results. Persistence of PCR positivity does not correlate with antibody strength or symptoms of COVID-19. If anti-spike antibody is used to assess CP potency, individuals who suffered severe COVID-19 disease symptoms may represent better donors.","Ikegami, Sachie; Benirschke, Robert; Flanagan, Tara; Tanna, Nicole; Klein, Tovah; Elue, Rita; Debosz, Patricia; Mallek, Jessica; Wright, Gregory; Guariglia, Perry; Kang, Jason; Gniadek, Thomas J",Transfusion,572,1

Around the globe, a total of 71429 were infected up to February 17, 2020, with 98.9% of cases in China. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized the COVID-19 as 'pandemic'. Rapid positive worldwide incidence was the motivation behind this study to investigate the incidence and mortality globally. METHODS: We used the data published by the WHO until March 9, 2020. Non-parametric tests and change point analysis were used for inferences. RESULTS: Change point analysis for Iran and China and the world excluding China for the first 20 days revealed around 78, 195 and 2 further new cases per day, respectively. Italy had a big jump in incidence on the 36th day. Similarly, a sharp rise of positive cases was reported for the world on the 35th day. China successfully controlled the ascending reports of incidence on the 23rd day. Mortality in China and the world were almost similar for the first 20 days. There was an ascending incidence trend with two change points in Italy (30th and 36th days) and one change point in Iran on the 17th day. Mortality in the world jumped remarkably after day 42 with an estimation of almost more than 25 deaths per day. CONCLUSION: The incidence of COVID-19 varied by regions; however, after March 11, it became 'pandemic'. It was observed that after about 6 days with an emergence of sharp increase in incidences, there would be a mutation in mortality rate. On the other hand, the importance of 'on-time' quarantine programs in controlling this virus was confirmed.","Chaibakhsh, Samira; Pourhoseingholi, Asma; Vahedi, Mohsen",Arch Iran Med,572,16

The chemical structure model of the coal molecule was optimized, and the periodic boundary condition was added via the method of molecular dynamics methods. The different combined systems formed by collectors, water, and a model surface of Bulianta coal have been studied using molecular dynamics simulation. The simulation results of dodecanol and methyl laurate on the surface of Bulianta coal show that dodecanol molecules are not evenly adsorbed on the surface of coal, and have higher adsorption capacity near carboxyl and hydroxyl groups, but less adsorption capacity near carbonyl and ether bonds. Methyl laurate can completely cover the oxygen-containing functional groups on the coal surface. Compared with dodecanol, methyl laurate can effectively improve the hydrophobicity of the Bulianta coal surface, which is consistent with the results of the XPS test and the flotation test.","Zhang, He; Xi, Peng; Zhuo, Qiming; Liu, Wenli",Molecules (Basel),572,26

Social distancing (SD) interventions applied so far have included school closures, remote working and quarantine. These measures have been shown to have large impacts on pandemic influenza transmission. However, there has been comparatively little examination of such measures for COVID-19. Methods: We examined the existing literature, and collated data, on implementation of NPIs to examine their effects on the COVID-19 pandemic so far. Data on NPIs were collected from official government websites as well as from media sources. Results: Measures such as travel restrictions have been implemented in multiple countries and appears to have slowed the geographic spread of COVID-19 and reduced initial case numbers. We find that, due to the relatively sparse information on the differences with and without interventions, it is difficult to quantitatively assess the efficacy of many interventions. Similarly, whilst the comparison to other pandemic diseases such as influenza can be helpful, there are key differences that could affect the efficacy of similar NPIs. Conclusions: The timely implementation of control measures is key to their success and must strike a balance between early enough application to reduce the peak of the epidemic and ensuring that they can be feasibly maintained for an appropriate duration. Such measures can have large societal impacts and they need to be appropriately justified to the population. As the pandemic of COVID-19 progresses, quantifying the impact of interventions will be a vital consideration for the appropriate use of mitigation strategies.","Imai, Natsuko; Gaythorpe, Katy A.M.; Abbott, Sam; Bhatia, Sangeeta; van Elsland, Sabine; Prem, Kiesha; Liu, Yang; Ferguson, Neil M.",Wellcome Open Res.,572,16

The translation of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome for most open reading frames (ORFs) occurs via RNA intermediates termed ""subgenomic RNAs."" sgRNAs are produced through discontinuous transcription, which relies on homology between transcription regulatory sequences (TRS-B) upstream of the ORF start codons and that of the TRS-L, which is located in the 5' UTR. TRS-L is immediately preceded by a leader sequence. This leader sequence is therefore found at the 5' end of all sgRNA. We applied periscope to 1155 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Sheffield, United Kingdom, and validated our findings using orthogonal data sets and in vitro cell systems. By using a simple local alignment to detect reads that contain the leader sequence, we were able to identify and quantify reads arising from canonical and noncanonical sgRNA. We were able to detect all canonical sgRNAs at the expected abundances, with the exception of ORF10. A number of recurrent noncanonical sgRNAs are detected. We show that the results are reproducible using technical replicates and determine the optimum number of reads for sgRNA analysis. In VeroE6 ACE2+/- cell lines, periscope can detect the changes in the kinetics of sgRNA in orthogonal sequencing data sets. Finally, variants found in genomic RNA are transmitted to sgRNAs with high fidelity in most cases. This tool can be applied to all sequenced COVID-19 samples worldwide to provide comprehensive analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sgRNA.","Parker, Matthew D; Lindsey, Benjamin B; Leary, Shay; Gaudieri, Silvana; Chopra, Abha; Wyles, Matthew; Angyal, Adrienn; Green, Luke R; Parsons, Paul; Tucker, Rachel M; Brown, Rebecca; Groves, Danielle; Johnson, Katie; Carrilero, Laura; Heffer, Joe; Partridge, David G; Evans, Cariad; Raza, Mohammad; Keeley, Alexander J; Smith, Nikki; Filipe, Ana Da Silva; Shepherd, James G; Davis, Chris; Bennett, Sahan; Sreenu, Vattipally B; Kohl, Alain; Aranday-Cortes, Elihu; Tong, Lily; Nichols, Jenna; Thomson, Emma C; Wang, Dennis; Mallal, Simon; de Silva, Thushan I",Genome Res,572,27

This study examined vicarious racism and vigilance in relation to symptoms of depression and anxiety among Asian and Black Americans. METHODS: We used data from a cross-sectional study of 604 Asian American and 844 Black American adults aged &#8805;18 in the United States recruited from 5 US cities from May 21 through July 15, 2020. Multivariable linear regression models examined levels of depression and anxiety by self-reported vicarious racism and vigilance. RESULTS: Controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, among both Asian and Black Americans, greater self-reported vicarious racism was associated with more symptoms of depression (Asian: ß = 1.92 [95% CI, 0.97-2.87]; Black: ß = 1.72 [95% CI, 0.95-2.49]) and anxiety (Asian: ß = 2.40 [95% CI, 1.48-3.32]; Black: ß = 1.98 [95% CI, 1.17-2.78]). Vigilance was also positively related to symptoms of depression (Asian: ß = 1.54 [95% CI, 0.58-2.50]; Black: ß = 0.90 [95% CI, 0.12-1.67]) and anxiety (Asian: ß = 1.98 [95% CI, 1.05-2.91]; Black: ß = 1.64 [95% CI, 0.82-2.45]). CONCLUSIONS: Mental health problems are a pressing concern during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results from our study suggest that heightened racist sentiment, harassment, and violence against Asian and Black Americans contribute to increased risk of depression and anxiety via vicarious racism and vigilance. Public health efforts during this period should address endemic racism as well as COVID-19.","Chae, David H; Yip, Tiffany; Martz, Connor D; Chung, Kara; Richeson, Jennifer A; Hajat, Anjum; Curtis, David S; Rogers, Leoandra Onnie; LaVeist, Thomas A",Public Health Rep,572,5

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) recognized as the receptor of SARS-CoV is also necessary for SARS-CoV-2. However, the impact of ACE2 on SARSCoV-2 susceptibility and the situation of malignant tumor patients in this outbreak are unclear. So, it is important to understand the expressions of ACE2 in different normal tissues and cancers. The results showed that the kidneys, duodenum, intestine, gallbladder and testis had the highest ACE2 expressions, followed by the colon, rectum and seminal vesicles. The lungs had a very low expression. ACE2 expressions were upregulated in renal cancer, gastrointestinal tumor and lung cancer. ACE2 expression levels may affect SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity. A total of 3,421 cases with COVID-19 have been collected. Among them, 43 cases (1.26%) had malignant tumor coexisting conditions. The rate of severe events for malignant tumor patients was 39.02% (16/41), while the rate of severe events for all patients was 10.79% (194/1,798). The clinical symptoms and signs were studied for the following three systems: respiratory (31-92%), digestive (10-13%) and urinary systems (3.38%).

Baseline characteristics, clinical presentation, antiviral and immunosuppressive management were compared between patients with mild/moderate and severe disease (defined as ICU admission, intubation or death). Ninety patients were analyzed with a median age of 57 years. Forty-six were kidney recipients, 17 lung, 13 liver, 9 heart, and 5 dual-organ transplants. The most common presenting symptoms were fever (70%), cough (59%), and dyspnea (43%). Twenty-two (24%) had mild, 41 (46%) moderate, and 27 (30%) severe disease.

Sixteen patients died (18% overall, 24% of hospitalized, 52% of ICU) and 37 (54%) were discharged. In this initial cohort, transplant recipients with COVID-19 appear to have more severe outcomes, although testing limitations likely led to undercounting of mild/asymptomatic cases.

Although these changes are necessary, they will differentially affect patients in a way that highlights and exacerbates existing inequities in health care access and outcomes. Socially vulnerable groups are already disproportionately affected by COVID-19 infection and more likely to experience severe morbidity and mortality. Some reasons for this include a limited ability to practice risk-reducing behaviors such as physical distancing, higher prevalence of chronic medical conditions, and less access to medical care. Additionally, the structural changes now taking place in health care delivery have negatively affected the ability of socially vulnerable groups to obtain necessary obstetric and gynecologic care, which may lead to poorer outcomes.

At present, the virus has infected over 1.7 million people and caused over 100 000 deaths worldwide. Research is currently focused on understanding the acute infection and developing effective treatment strategies. In view of the magnitude of the epidemic, we conducted a speculative review of possible medium- and long-term neurological consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with particular emphasis on neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases of neuroinflammatory origin, based on the available evidence on neurological symptoms of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. DEVELOPMENT: We systematically reviewed the available evidence about the pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the immediate and lasting effects of the cytokine storm on the central nervous system, and the consequences of neuroinflammation for the central nervous system. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 is a neuroinvasive virus capable of triggering a cytokine storm, with persistent effects in specific populations. Although our hypothesis is highly speculative, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the onset and progression of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases of neuroinflammatory origin should be regarded as the potential cause of a delayed pandemic that may have a major public health impact in the medium to long term. Cognitive and neuropsychological function should be closely monitored in COVID-19 survivors.","Serrano-Castro, P J; Estivill-Torrús, G; Cabezudo-García, P; Reyes-Bueno, J A; Ciano Petersen, N; Aguilar-Castillo, M J; Suárez-Pérez, J; Jiménez-Hernández, M D; Moya-Molina, M Á; Oliver-Martos, B; Arrabal-Gómez, C; Rodríguez de Fonseca, F",Neurologia,572,16

METHODS: Data on confirmed cases and deaths from COVID-19 for 2,814 US counties were obtained from Johns Hopkins University. We used Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to map the spatial aspects of this pandemic and investigate the disparities between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan communities. Multiple regression models were used to explore the contextual risk factors of infections and death across US counties. We included population density, percent of population aged 65+, percent population in poverty, percent minority population, and percent of the uninsured as independent variables. A state-level measure of the percent of the population that has been tested for COVID-19 was used to control for the impact of testing. FINDINGS: The impact of COVID-19 in the United States has been extremely uneven. Although densely populated large cities and their surrounding metropolitan areas are hotspots of the pandemic, it is counterintuitive that incidence and mortality rates in some small cities and nonmetropolitan counties approximate those in epicenters such as New York City. Regression analyses support the hypotheses of positive correlations between COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates and socioeconomic factors including population density, proportions of elderly residents, poverty, and percent population tested. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge about the spatial aspects of the COVID-19 epidemic and its socioeconomic correlates can inform first responders and government efforts.

METHODS: We studied 2275 symptomatic and asymptomatic patients from Colombia with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and analyzed the associations between RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) value with gender, age, comorbidities, symptomatology, and disease severity. RESULTS: 15.4 % of the samples (n = 428) reported at least one comorbidity. There were 2011 symptomatic cases (72.4 %), being the most common reported symptom cough (57.2 %, n = 1586). Respiratory distress was present in 21.4 % of patients (n = 595), and 435 patients (15.6 %) required hospital admission. We observed that patients with no prior medical history harbored higher RNA copies than patients with comorbidities (p = 0.02). No significant differences in RNA copies were observed between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients (p = 0.82). Strong correlations were detected between Ct values and the presence of odynophagia (p = 0.03), diarrhea (p = 0.04), and headache (p = 0.0008). An inverse association was found between RNA copy number and markers of disease severity, namely, respiratory distress (P < 0.0001) and hospitalization requirement (P < 0.0001).

Though, such features of social media platforms also present it a root cause of fake news distribution, causing adverse consequences on both people and culture. Hence, detecting fake news has become a significant research interest for bringing feasible real time solutions to the problem. Most current techniques of fake news disclosure are supervised, that need large cost in terms of time and effort to make a certainly interpreted dataset. The proposed framework concentrates on the text-based detection of fake news items while considering that only limited number of labels are available. Graphs are functioned extensively under several purposes of real-world problems on the strength of their property to structure things easily. Deep neural networks are used to generate great results within tasks that utilizes graph classification. The Graph Convolution Network works as a deep learning paradigm which works on graphs. Our proposed framework deals with limited amount of labelled data; we go for a semi-supervised learning method. We come up with a semi-supervised fake news detection technique based on GCN (Graph Convolutional Networks). The recommended architecture comprises of three basic components: collecting word embeddings from the news articles in datasets utilising GloVe, building similarity graph using Word Movers Distance (WMD) and finally applying Graph Convolution Network (GCN) for binary classification of news articles in semi-supervised paradigm. The implemented technique is validated on three different datasets by varying the volume of labelled data achieving 95.27 % highest accuracy on Real or Fake dataset. Comparison with other contemporary techniques also reinforced the supremacy of the proposed framework.","Meel, Priyanka; Vishwakarma, Dinesh Kumar",,572,16

Studies on large and small cohorts of IEI reported a huge variability clinical manifestations associated to SARS-Cov-2, ranging from asymptomatic, mild, moderate/severe to death. A great impulse to improve remote assistance programs and to switch to home-based treatment to reduce mobility and face to face contacts has been implemented. Areas covered: The authors completed a comprehensive review of the literature by searching the PubMed database for studies on large and small cohorts and case reports of IEI patients with COVID-19, with the aim to provide useful information for their clinical management during the COVID-19 pandemic. Expert opinion: Surprisingly, a low number of IEI patients affected by SARS-Cov-2 were reported with a risk to die for COVID-19 overlapping that of the general population. The low number might be explained by the choice of most physicians to inform early in the pandemic about safety measures, to switch most of the IEI patients to home therapy and to remote assistance. The guidelines issued by the scientific societies and periodically updated, represent the best tool for the clinical management of IEI patients.","Quinti, Isabella; Mezzaroma, Ivano; Milito, Cinzia",Expert Rev Clin Immunol,572,21

METHODS: This was a prospective study of 100 patients with DM who were admitted in a COVID isolation ward for management of COVID-19. Patients managed with multiple subcutaneous insulin injections were eligible. During teleconsultation, diabetes education including insulin injection technique was given by a diabetes educator via a phone call (audio and video) during hospitalization. They were also re-assessed after 2 weeks of discharge from the hospital via teleconsultation or in-person. RESULTS: Out of 100 patients, 72.0% had prior history of diabetes while 28.0% were newly diagnosed. The median age of our cohort was 56 years and median duration of diabetes was 7.0 years. Telemedicine as a mode of consult for diabetes education was accepted by 96.0% of patients during hospitalization. At 2 weeks' follow-up, 77.0% patients were following insulin instructions correctly and were satisfied with this mode of consultation. CONCLUSION: Diabetes education using telemedicine as a technology is feasible, acceptable, and effective in the management of most patients with DM.

There is a growing body of research that aims to understand the experiences of these parents, but the majority of this research is from mothers' perspectives, meaning that fathers' experiences are not well understood. OBJECTIVES: To identify and synthesise findings from existing qualitative studies that have explored the experiences of fathers of children with a life-limiting condition. METHODS: A systematic review of qualitative research was conducted using thematic synthesis. Searches were conducted in MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Social Science Citation Index. RESULTS: Findings from 30 studies were included, representing the experiences of 576 fathers of children with a range of diagnoses including cancer, cystic fibrosis, genetic and neurological conditions. Themes detailed fathers' experiences of uncertainty and shock around the time of their child's diagnosis, their accounts of a 'new normal', difficulties in discussing their emotions, forming relationships with and seeking support from professionals and working fathers' role conflicts. They discussed the life-changing nature of their child's diagnosis, an event that affected all aspects of their lives from everyday activities, to their relationships, spirituality, values and ambitions. CONCLUSIONS: Fathers experience many difficulties in response to their child's diagnosis and ongoing treatment. Findings highlight the need for healthcare professionals to recognise individual family dynamics and the evolving role of the father.

Evaluating the effects of these policies, both on the number of Covid-19 cases as well on other economic outcomes is a key ingredient for policymakers to be able to determine which policies are most effective as well as the relative costs and benefits of particular policies. In this paper, we consider the relative merits of common identification strategies exploiting variation in policy choices made across different locations by checking whether the identification strategies are compatible with leading epidemic models in the epidemiology literature. We argue that unconfoundedness type approaches are likely to be more useful for evaluating policies than difference in differences type approaches due to the highly nonlinear spread of cases during a pandemic. For difference in differences, we further show that a version of this problem continues to exist even when one is interested in understanding the effect of a policy on other economic outcomes when those outcomes also depend on the number of Covid-19 cases. We propose alternative approaches that are able to circumvent these issues. We apply our proposed approach to study the effect of state level shelter-in-place orders early in the pandemic.","Callaway, Brantly; Li, Tong",,572,24

Artemisinin, an old antimalarial drug derived from Chinese herbs, has saved millions of lives. Artemisinins are a cluster of artemisinin-related drugs developed for the treatment of malaria and have been reported to have multiple pharmacological activities, including anticancer, antiviral, and immune modulation. Considering the reported broad-spectrum antiviral potential of artemisinins, researchers are interested in whether they could be used to combat COVID-19. We systematically evaluated the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities of nine artemisinin-related compounds in vitro and carried out a time-of-drug-addition assay to explore their antiviral mode of action. Finally, a pharmacokinetic prediction model was established to predict the therapeutic potential of selected compounds against COVID-19. Arteannuin B showed the highest anti-SARS-CoV-2 potential with an EC50 of 10.28 ± 1.12 µM. Artesunate and dihydroartemisinin showed similar EC50 values of 12.98 ± 5.30 µM and 13.31 ± 1.24 µM, respectively, which could be clinically achieved in plasma after intravenous administration. Interestingly, although an EC50 of 23.17 ± 3.22 µM was not prominent among the tested compounds, lumefantrine showed therapeutic promise due to high plasma and lung drug concentrations after multiple dosing. Further mode of action analysis revealed that arteannuin B and lumefantrine acted at the post-entry step of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This research highlights the anti-SARS-CoV-2 potential of artemisinins and provides leading candidates for anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug research and development.","Cao, Ruiyuan; Hu, Hengrui; Li, Yufeng; Wang, Xi; Xu, Mingyue; Liu, Jia; Zhang, Huanyu; Yan, Yunzheng; Zhao, Lei; Li, Wei; Zhang, Tianhong; Xiao, Dian; Guo, Xiaojia; Li, Yuexiang; Yang, Jingjing; Hu, Zhihong; Wang, Manli; Zhong, Wu",ACS Infect Dis,572,29

The objective was to investigate whether hypokalemia acts as a biomarker of severity in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia and is associated with major clinical outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of inpatients with COVID-19 pneumonia (March 3 to May 2, 2020) was performed. Patients were categorized according to nadir levels of K+ in the first 72â¯h of admission: hypokalemia (K+ &#8804;3.5â¯mmol/l) and normokalemia (K+ >3.5â¯mmol/l). The main outcomes were all-cause mortality and the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV); these were analyzed by multiple logistic regression (odds ratio (OR), 95% confidence interval (CI)). RESULTS: Three hundred and six patients were enrolled. Ninety-four patients (30.7%) had hypokalemia and these patients showed significantly higher comorbidity (Charlson comorbidity index &#8805;3, 30.0% vs 16.3%; pâ¯=â¯ 0.02) and CURB65 scores (median (interquartile range): 1.5 (0.0-3.0) vs 1.0 (0.0-2.0); pâ¯=â¯ 0.04), as well as higher levels of some inflammatory parameters at baseline. After adjustment for confounders, hypokalemia was independently associated with requiring IMV during the admission (OR 8.98, 95% CI 2.54-31.74). Mortality was 15.0% (nâ¯=â¯46) and was not influenced by low K+. Hypokalemia was associated with longer hospital and ICU stays. CONCLUSIONS: Hypokalemia is prevalent in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Hypokalemia is an independent predictor of IMV requirement and seems to be a sensitive biomarker of severe progression of COVID-19.","Moreno-P, Oscar; Leon-Ramirez, Jose-Manuel; Fuertes-Kenneally, Laura; Perdiguero, Miguel; Andres, Mariano; Garcia-Navarro, Mar; Ruiz-Torregrosa, Paloma; Boix, Vicente; Gil, Joan; Merino, Esperanza",Int J Infect Dis,572,16

In particular, NO has potential in treating mechanical device-associated thrombosis due to its ability to reduce platelet activation and due to the central role of platelet activation and adhesion in device thrombosis. Nitrite is a unique NO donor that reduces platelet activation in that it's activity requires the presence of red blood cells whereas NO activity of other NO donors is blunted by red blood cells. Interestingly, we have previously shown that red blood cell mediated inhibition of platelet activation by adenosine diphosophate (ADP) is dramatically enhanced by illumination with far-red light that is likely due to photolysis of red cell surface bound NO congeners. We now report the effects of nitrite, far-red light, and their combination on several measure of blood coagulation using a variety of agonists. We employed turbidity assays in platelet rich plasma, platelet activation using flow cytometry analysis of a fluorescently labeled antibody to the activated platelet fibrinogen binding site, multiplate impedance-based platelet aggregometry, and assessment of platelet adhesion to collagen coated flow-through microslides. In all cases, the combination of far-red light and nitrite treatment decreased measures of coagulation, but in some cases mono-treatment with nitrite or light alone had no effect. Perhaps most relevant to device thrombosis, we observed that platelet adhesions was inhibited by the combination of nitrite and light treatment while nitrite alone and far-red light alone trended to decrease adhesion, but the results were mixed. These results support the potential of combined far-red light and nitrite treatment for preventing thrombosis in extra-corporeal or shallow-tissue depth devices where the far-red light can penetrate. Such a combined treatment could be advantageous due to the localized treatment afforded by far-red light illumination with minimal systemic effects. Given the role of thrombosis in COVID 19, application to treatment of patients infected with SARS Cov-2 might also be considered.","Wajih, Nadeem; Alipour, Elmira; Rigal, Fernando; Zhu, Jiqing; Perlegas, Andreas; Caudell, David L; Kim-Shapiro, Daniel",Nitric Oxide,572,1

This commentary seeks to alert and encourage the health care provider community, including health care professionals and academic organizations, to engage in social media to counter the mounting vaccine-related infodemic. To validate our recommendation for engagement, the authors describe preliminary findings using a mixed methods approach of quantitative Twitter-based ranking algorithms of networks and users with qualitative content analysis of 1 million tweets related to COVID-19 vaccine conversations. Results show highly polarized and active antivaccine conversations that were primarily influenced by political and nonmedical Twitter users. In contrast, less than 10% of the tweets stemmed from the medical community, demonstrating a lack of active health care professional connectivity in addressing COVID-19 misinformation. The authors introduce the concept of Health Care Provider Social Media Hesitancy to refer to the public health threat of health care providers' nonaction in providing pro-vaccine and scientific information about the vaccine on social media. The authors conclude by describing multilevel strategies for encouraging health care providers and the medical community to effectively ""Tweet up"" to combat the mounting threat of vaccine misinformation and hesitancy.","Hernandez, Raquel G; Hagen, Loni; Walker, Kimberly; O039,; Leary, Heather; Lengacher, Cecile",Hum Vaccin Immunother,572,1

In France, teachers and radiography students in initial training, not specially prepared for this, had to adapt. An evaluation of the system was proposed to the students. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An anonymous online questionnaire with 4 main sections (pedagogy, communication, learning and concerns) was sent to 91 students at the end of the semester. RESULTS: 91 responses were received. The slideshows with sound or presented during a virtual class are appreciated by the students. Online quizzes are ideal for learning/reviewing. For assessments, individual assignments and online questionnaires are appreciated. Teacher/student interaction via e-mail or video conferencing was considered satisfactory by the large majority of students. Student-student interactions via social networks, for course explanations or document exchange, are very suitable. The majority of students felt they were working a lot and much more compared to face-to-face teaching. Less than half of the students worked more than 20 h per week. Their motivation varied widely. Organizational habits were disrupted, but the autonomy granted was appreciated. The students were mainly concerned about the health of their loved ones and not about their own health. DISCUSSION: The use of distance education tools requires teacher commitment and technical skills. The frequency of communication by e-mail and/or videoconference between members of the teaching team and students must be adapted to the situation. Exchanges by e-mail allow for traceability, while videoconferencing allows direct interaction and a way out of isolation. Autonomy, appreciated by the students, was nevertheless combined with a strong variation in motivation; the anxiety-provoking period in which pedagogical continuity was built up may explain this contradictory observation. CONCLUSION: The results obtained largely confirm the data in the literature. The experience gained through this survey should lead teachers to continue their reflection by test/integrating and evaluating distance education systems, while continuing face-to-face activities.","Zorn, Claudine; Feffer, Marie-Laurence; Bauer, Éric; Dillenseger, Jean-Philippe",J Med Imaging Radiat Sci,572,12

Although Nigeria adopted lockdown measures, no defined strategies were used in setting the distance threshold for these lockdowns. Hence, understanding the drivers of COVID-19 is pivotal to an informed decision for containment measures in the absence of vaccines. Spatial and temporal analyses are crucial drivers to apprehending the pattern of diseases over space and time. Thus, this study aimed to quantify the significance of distance to the temporal dynamics of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria using the Geographic Information System. Incremental spatial autocorrelation was used to analyze datasets of each month in ArcGIS. March, April, May, and June exhibited patterns with no significant peaks, while July and August exhibited patterns with two statistically significant peaks. The first and second peaks of July were 301,338.39 and 365,947.83 meters, respectively, while August was 301,338.39 and 336,128.09 meters, respectively. Therefore, a significant difference in the clustering of COVID-19 over distances between July and August was established. This indicated that progression in the spread of the virus increased the virus's spatial coverage while the distance of risk of exposure decreased. This study's findings could be utilized to establish maximum movement restriction areas to contain the spread of COVID-19.","Obuekwe, I. S.; Anka, U. S.; Ibrahim, S. O.; Adam, U.

Based on pathophysiological derangements observed in COVID-19 patients, a rationale emerges for sequential extracorporeal therapies designed to remove inflammatory mediators and support different organ systems. In the absence of vaccines or direct therapy for COVID-19, extracorporeal therapies could represent an option to prevent organ failure and improve survival.

Accurate, non-invasive diagnostic methods using CT imaging can help developing an optimal therapeutic regimen for both conditions. OBJECTIVES: To compare the initial CT imaging features in COVID-19 with those in other types of viral pneumonia. METHODS: Clinical and imaging data of 51 patients with COVID-19 and 69 with other types of viral pneumonia were retrospectively studied. All significant imaging features (Youden index >0.3) were included for constituting the combined criteria for COVID-19 diagnosis, composed of two or more imaging features with a parallel model. McNemar's chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was used to compare the validity indices (sensitivity and specificity) among various criteria. RESULTS: Ground glass opacities (GGO) dominated density, peripheral distribution, unilateral lung, clear margin of lesion, rounded morphology, long axis parallel to the pleura, vascular thickening, and crazy-paving pattern were more common in COVID-19 (p <0.05). Consolidation-dominated density, both central and peripheral distribution, bilateral lung, indistinct margin of lesion, tree-in-bud pattern, mediastinal or hilar lymphadenectasis, pleural effusion, and pleural thickening were more common in other types of viral pneumonia (p < 0.05). GGO-dominated density or long axis parallel to the pleura (with the highest sensitivity), and GGO-dominated density or long axis parallel to the pleura or vascular thickening (with the highest specificity) are good combined criteria of COVID-19.

Objective: The goal of this review is to highlight the mechanisms underlying PARP1 activation during viral or infectious pathogenesis and to assess potential possibilities of using PARP1 inhibitors as a therapeutic countering of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Methods: An extensive bibliographic search was done using Pubmed, Mendeley and google scholar with key words. Pre-prints are reported with potential caveats and studies without experimental data were excluded. Results: Covid-19, a global pandemic; is associated with systemic surge of inflammatory cytokines resulting in severe inflammation of the lung, heart dysfunction, ischemia, and stroke. PARP1 regulates expression of NFkB and downstream cytokine production and its inhibition is known to attenuate the expression of inflammatory cytokines. PARP1 and other PARP family members regulate viral infection, replication, and virulence. The literature clearly suggests that PARP1 plays an important role in host-pathogen interactions and pathogenesis, with pre-clinical and in vitro studies supporting the idea that PARP1 inhibition may negatively affect viability of several viruses including the replication of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 virus. Conclusion: The current review discusses mechanisms of PARP1 activation during viral infection, inflammatory diseases, cytokine expression and possibility of PARP1 in regulating cytokine storm and hyper-inflammation seen with Covid-19. Additionally, in vitro studies showing the negative regulation of SARS-CoV-2 virus replication by PARP inhibitors indicates a potential therapeutic role of PARP inhibitors for Covid-19 or its variants.","Rajawat, Jyotika; Chandra, Abhishek",Current drug targets (Print),572,1

In view of the increasing awareness about the prevalence of mild cognitive dysfunction in multiple system atrophy, the relevance of autonomic dysfunction in demented parkinsonian patients, the critical role of non-motor symptoms in clustering Parkinson's disease patients and the shift to studying patients in the prodromal phase, we will discuss some intrinsic limitations of current clinical diagnostic criteria, even when applied by movement disorder specialists. In particular, we will focus on the early coexistence of autonomic and cognitive dysfunction in the setting of overt or latent parkinsonism as pitfalls in the differential diagnosis of &#945;-synucleinopathies.

However, previous knowledge pertaining to the related SARS virus and other human coronaviruses may prove useful. Population-based serosurveys measuring anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may provide a pattern for estimating infection degrees and observing the development of the epidemic. In this study, we aimed to investigate the persistence of antibody against the SARS-CoV-2 in recovered patients in Al Madinah region of Saudi Arabia. Materials and methods: A total of 150 recovered COVID-19 patients participated in this study. All the patients tested positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, using qualitative RT-PCR. An ELISA was used to measure anti-Spike (S) IgG antibodies in serum samples and screen for their persistence at various time points post-infection. Results: The patients were categorized as asymptomatic (27.3%), mild (28%) and moderate (44.7%) according to the disease severity. Amongst them, 35.3% were females (n = 53) and 64.7% were males (n = 97). Significant anti-S IgG antibody levels were observed among the different groups, with the patients in moderate group exhibiting the highest levels followed by the mild group; while the lowest levels were detected among the asymptomatic. There was a significant positive correlation between the patients' age and anti-S IgG antibody concentrations (Pearson r = 0.45; p < 0.001). Conclusion: Our findings provide a solid evidence to support the use of an anti-S IgG ELISA as a diagnostic tool to indicate SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In more than 80% of patients tested, nasopharyngeal swabs were negative on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 when performed, and serology was generally not performed. METHODS: A national survey was launched on 30 March 2020 by the French Society of Dermatology asking physicians to report cases of skin manifestations in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 by using a standardized questionnaire. We report the results for acral manifestations. RESULTS: We collected 311 cases of acral manifestations [58.5% women, median age 25.7 years (range 18-39)]. The most frequent clinical presentation (65%) was typical chilblains. In total, 93 cases (30%) showed clinical suspicion of COVID-19, 67 (22%) had only less specific infectious symptoms and 151 (49%) had no clinical signs preceding or during the course of acral lesions. Histology of skin biopsies was consistent with chilblains. Overall, 12 patients showed significant immunological abnormalities. Of the 150 (48%) patients who were tested, 10 patients were positive. Seven of 121 (6%) RT-PCR-tested patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2, and five of 75 (7%) serology-tested patients had IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2. Tested/untested patients or those with/without confirmed COVID-19 did not differ in age, sex, history or acral lesion clinical characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this survey do not rule out that SARS-CoV-2 could be directly responsible for some cases of chilblains, but we found no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the large majority of patients with acral lesions during the COVID-19 lockdown period in France.","Le Cleach, L; Dousset, L; Assier, H; Fourati, S; Barbarot, S; Boulard, C; Bourseau Quetier, C; Cambon, L; Cazanave, C; Colin, A; Kostrzewa, E; Lesort, C; Levy Roy, A; Lombart, F; Marco-Bonnet, J; Monfort, J-B; Samimi, M; Tardieu, M; Wolkenstein, P; Sbidian, E; Beylot-Barry, M",Br. j. dermatol,572,16

As has been reported, most of non-survivor patients with COVID-19 (70%) had septic shock which was significantly higher than survived ones. Although the exact pathophysiology of septic shock in these patients is still unclear, it seems to be possible that part of it would be due to the administration of empiric antibiotics with inflammatory properties especially in the absence of bacterial infection. Herein, we have reviewed possible molecular pathways of septic shock in the patients who have received antibiotics with inflammatory properties which mainly is release of interleukin 1ß (IL-1ß), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor &#945; (TNF- &#945;) through different routes.

However, little is known about its involvement in coronary artery disease (CAD). Here, we aimed to investigate the association between Dab2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and CAD in Chinese Han and Uyghur populations.We performed a case-control study in CAD group that consisted of 621 Han and 346 Uygurs, and the age and gender matched control group consisted of 611 Han and 405 Uygurs. The clinicopathological characteristics of these subjects were analyzed. Genotyping of 4 SNPs (rs1050903, rs2855512, rs11959928, and rs2255280) of the Dab2 gene was performed in all subjects with an improved multiplex ligase detection reaction method.The distribution of the genotype, dominant model (AA vs. ACâ+âCC), as well as allele frequencies of both rs2855512 and rs2255280, was significantly different between CAD patients and control subjects in Han population but not in Uyghur population. AA genotype may be a risk factor for CAD. For Han population, statistical significant correlation between dominant model for both SNPs (AA) and CAD was found after multivariate adjustment. After multivariate adjustment in the Han population, we speculate that rs285512 A allele and rs2255280 A allele may be potentially associated with the onset of coronary heart disease. Individuals with the AA genotype had an OR of 1.44 (95% CI: 1.10-1.88, Pâ=â.01, rs2855512) and 1.41 (95% CI: 1.08-1.85, Pâ=â.01, rs2255280) for CAD compared with individuals with the AC or CC genotype, respectively.Our data indicates that the AA genotype of rs2855512 and rs2255280 in the Dab2 gene may be a genetic marker of CAD risk in Chinese Han population.","Wang, Yinghong; Wang, Yongtao; Adi, Dilare; He, XiaoDong; Liu, Fen; Abudesimu, Asiya; Fu, Zhenyan; Ma, Yitong",Medicine (Baltimore),572,16

Because COVID-19 is primarily manifesting as an acute respiratory illness with interstitial and alveolar pneumonia, the possibility of viral invasions into the other organs cannot be disregarded. Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been associated with various viral infections including dengue, chikungunya, Zika, and HIV. The prevalence and risks of AKI during the course of COVID-19 have been described in few studies. However, the existing literature demonstrate great disparity across findings amid variations in methodology and population. This article underscores the propensity of AKI among COVID-19 patients, limitations of the exiting evidence, and importance of timely identification during the case management. The prevalence of AKI is variable across the studies ranging from 4.7% to 81%. Evidence suggest old age, comorbidities, ventilator support, use of vasopressors, black race, severe infection, and elevated levels of baseline serum creatinine and d-dimers are independent risk factors of COVID-19 associated with AKI. COVID-19 patients with AKI also showed unsatisfactory renal recovery and higher mortality rate as compared with patients without AKI. These findings underscore that AKI frequently occurs during the course of COVID-19 infection and requires early stratification and management.","Mallhi, Tauqeer Hussain; Khan, Yusra Habib; Adnan, Azreen Syazril",Am J Trop Med Hyg,572,16

The unique challenge for clinicians has been to define which arthroplasty patients most urgently require surgery. The present study aimed to investigate priority arthroplasty procedures during the pandemic and in the reinstatement period from the surgeon's perspective. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An online survey was conducted among members of the European Hip Society (EHS), European Knee Associates (EKA) and other invited orthopaedic arthroplasty surgeons (experts) from across the world. The survey consisted of 17 different arthroplasty procedures/indications of which participants were asked to choose and rank the most important 10. RESULTS: Four hundred and thirty-nine arthroplasty surgeons from 44 countries responded. The EHS and EKA had a 43% response rate of members. In weighted average points, the majority of respondents (67.5 points) ranked 'acute fractures requiring arthroplasty (Periprosthetic fractures, THA/hemi-arthroplasty for femoral neck fractures)' as priority indication number one, followed by 'first-stage explantations for acute PJI (periprosthetic joint infection)' in second place and priority indication (45.9 points) three as 'one-stage revision for acute PJI' (39.7 points). CONCLUSIONS: There was agreement that femoral neck fractures, periprosthetic fractures, and acute infections should be prioritised and cannot be postponed in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic. As arthroplasty procedures are being resumed in most countries now, there has also been a relaxation of lockdown rules in most countries, which might cause a so-called second wave of the pandemic. Therefore, the results of the current study present a proposal by experts as to which operations should be prioritised in the setting of a second wave of the pandemic.","Thaler, Martin; Kort, Nanne; Zagra, Luigi; Hirschmann, Michael T; Khosravi, Ismail; Liebensteiner, Michael; Karachalios, Theofilos; Tandogan, Reha N",Knee surg. sports traumatol. arthrosc,572,1

However, the detailed association of thrombocytopenia with subsequent progression of organ functions and long-term prognosis in critically ill COVID-19 patients remains to be explored. METHODS: Medical records of 167 confirmed cases of critically ill COVID-19 from February 16 to March 21, 2020 were collected in this two-center retrospective study. 180-day's outcome and clinical organ development in patients with thrombocytopenia and non-thrombocytopenia were analyzed. FINDINGS: Among all 167 patients, the median age was 66 years and 67.07% were male. Significant differences were noticed in laboratory findings including white blood cells, blood urea, total bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase and SOFA score between groups of thrombocytopenia and non-thrombocytopenia. Older age, lower platelet count and longer activated partial thromboplastin time at admission were determined to be risk factors of 28-day mortality, and all three, together with higher white blood cells were risk factors of 180-day mortality. Subsequent changes of six-point ordinal scale score, oxygenation index, and SOFA score in patients with thrombocytopenia showed marked worsening trends compared with patients without thrombocytopenia. Patients with thrombocytopenia had significantly higher mortality not only in 28 days, but also in 90 days and 180 days. The time-course curves in non-survival group showed a downtrend of platelet count and oxygenation index, while the curve of six-point ordinal scale kept an uptrend. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that patients with thrombocytopenia had much lower probability of survival (p<0.01). INTERPRETATION: The thrombocytopenia was associated with the deterioration of respiratory function. Baseline platelet count was associated with subsequent and long-term mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients.","Zhu, Yuan; Zhang, Jing; Li, Yiming; Liu, Fang; Zhou, Qing; Peng, Zhiyong",PLoS One,572,26

The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between HL and demographic characteristics with COVID-19 anxiety in adults living in Iran at the time of coronavirus outbreak. This is a descriptive and correlational study conducted in Iran in 2021. Convenience and snowball sampling methods were used, and as the result, the number of samples reached to 560. Data were collected online through the demographic questionnaire, COVID-19 anxiety scale (CAS) and health literacy questionnaire for adults (HLQ for adults). Data were analyzed using Amos 26, SPSS 26 software and structural equational modeling (SEM) based on covariance. Significance level in this study was considered 0.05. The results of this study showed that the fit of the modify model is confirmed and HL explains 54% of the changes in anxiety in the model (β = -0.709). The variables of gender, history of chronic disease, positive history of COVID 19 and receiving social support have a moderating role in the relationship between HL and COVID-19 anxiety. Due to the great predicting role of HL in COVID-19 anxiety, it is recommended that programs be developed and implemented during the outbreak of the disease by experts and the public health policy makers to increase HL in physical and mental dimensions.","Mohammadkhah, Fatemeh Shamsalinia Abbas Shirinkam Fatemeh Daneshnia Mahboubeh Mahmoudian Amaneh Rafiei Nastaran Atashpoosh Abolfazl Ghaffari Fatemeh",Heliyon,572,1

Case summary We report a case of a 70-year-old woman admitted to hospital with severe COVID-19 bilateral pneumonia who developed severe coagulopathy with multiple both, venous and arterial, embolisms in major vessels such as bilateral pulmonary embolism, acute thrombus in abdominal aorta, and acute thrombotic occlusion of the right iliac common artery. The patient underwent emergent surgical thrombectomy of the right lower limb;in spite of anticoagulant treatment at therapeutic doses, patient presented poor clinical evolution and an infracondylar amputation of right lower limb was made finally. Subsequently, the patient received low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), antibiotics and antiviral therapy improving her renal function and her pneumonia, so she could be discharged safely. Discussion Prothrombotic coagulopathy due to enhanced acute inflammatory response and diffuse intravascular coagulation has been described in severe critical COVID-19 patients. This state of hypercoagulability is associated with organ dysfunction and mortality and may predispose to both, venous and arterial, thromboembolism. Little data are available regarding the best therapeutic and prevention strategies in this scenario, although thrombosis prophylaxis with LMWH has been associated with a better outcome.","Del Castillo-Garcia, S.; Minguito-Carazo, C.; Echarte, J.

Here we analyzed SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequences and viral loads from 1,373 persons with COVID-19 from the San Francisco Bay Area from February 1 to June 30, 2021, of which 125 (9.1%) were vaccine breakthrough infections. Fully vaccinated were more likely than unvaccinated persons to be infected by variants carrying mutations associated with decreased antibody neutralization (L452R, L452Q, E484K, and/or F490S) (78% versus 48%, p = 1.96e-08), but not by those associated with increased infectivity only (N501Y) (85% versus 77%, p = 0.092). Differences in viral loads were non-significant between unvaccinated and fully vaccinated persons overall (p = 0.99) and according to lineage (p = 0.09 - 0.78). Viral loads were significantly higher in symptomatic as compared to asymptomatic vaccine breakthrough cases (p < 0.0001), and symptomatic vaccine breakthrough infections had similar viral loads to unvaccinated infections (p = 0.64). In 5 cases with available longitudinal samples for serologic analyses, vaccine breakthrough infections were found to be associated with low or undetectable neutralizing antibody levels attributable to immunocompromised state or infection by an antibody-resistant lineage. Taken together, our results suggest that vaccine breakthrough infecions are overrepresnted by circulating antibody-resistant SARS-CoV-2 variants, and that symptomatic breakthrough infections may potentially transmit COVID-19 as efficiently as unvaccinated infections, regardless of the infecting lineage.","Servellita, Venice; Sotomayor-Gonzalez, Alicia; Gliwa, Amelia; Torres, Erika; Brazer, Noah; Zhou, Alicia; Hernandez, Katherine; Sankaran, Madeline; Wang, Baolin; Wong, Daniel; Wang, Candace; Zhang, Yueyuan; Reyes, Kevin; Glasner, Dustin; Deng, Wayne; Streithorst, Jessica; Miller, Steve; Frias, Edwin; Hackett, John; Philip, Susan; Topper, Scott; Sachdev, Darpun; Chiu, Charles Y",,572,29

The present study aimed to examine whether the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination changed in different COVID-19 epidemic phases in China. Two consecutive surveys were conducted among Chinese adults in March (n = 2058) (severe epidemic phase) and November-December (n = 2013) (well-contained phase, right before the COVID-19 vaccine was conditionally approved) 2020, and 791 respondents were longitudinally followed-up. The attitude, acceptance, and preferences for future COVID-19 vaccination were compared between two epidemic phases. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify influencing factors of acceptance. Among the 791 respondents longitudinally followed, 91.9% in March and 88.6% of them in November-December 2020 would like to get COVID-19 vaccination in China. In March 58.3% wished to get vaccinated immediately, but the proportion declined to 23.0% in November-December 2020, because more respondents wanted to delay vaccination until the vaccine's safety was confirmed. Similar results were found by comparing all respondents from the two cross-sectional surveys in different epidemic phases. The risk perception, attitude for the importance of vaccination against COVID-19, vaccination history, valuing doctor's recommendations, vaccination convenience, or vaccine price in decision-making had impacts on respondents' intention for immediate vaccination. The public acceptance for COVID-19 vaccination in China sustained at a high level in different COVID-19 epidemic phases. However, the intention of immediate vaccination declined substantially due to concerns about the vaccine's safety. Information about vaccination safety from authoritative sources, doctor's recommendations, and vaccination convenience were important in addressing vaccine hesitancy and promoting successful herd immunity for the general population in China.","Wang, Jiahao; Lu, Xinran; Lai, Xiaozhen; Lyu, Yun; Zhang, Haijun; Fenghuang, Yufei; Jing, Rize; Li, Li; Yu, Wenzhou; Fang, Hai",,572,24

An urgent clinical reaction is required in the face of the unending devastation being caused by the pandemic. These efforts include technological innovations for improvement in screening, treatment, vaccine development, contact tracing and, survival prediction. The use of Deep Learning (DL) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be sought in all of the above-mentioned spheres. This paper aims to review the role of Deep Learning and Artificial intelligence in various aspects of the overall COVID-19 management and particularly for COVID-19 detection and classification. The DL models are developed to analyze clinical modalities like CT scans and X-Ray images of patients and predict their pathological condition. A DL model aims to detect the COVID-19 pneumonia, classify and distinguish between COVID-19, Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP), Viral and Bacterial pneumonia, and normal conditions. Furthermore, sophisticated models can be built to segment the affected area in the lungs and quantify the infection volume for a better understanding of the extent of damage. Many models have been developed either independently or with the help of pre-trained models like VGG19, ResNet50, and AlexNet leveraging the concept of transfer learning. Apart from model development, data preprocessing and augmentation are also performed to cope with the challenge of insufficient data samples often encountered in medical applications. It can be evaluated that DL and AI can be effectively implemented to withstand the challenges posed by the global emergency","Sarosh, Parsa; Parah, Shabir A.; Mansur, Romany F; Bhat, G. M.",,572,16

AIMS: To evaluate persistence of biological agents in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) and the effects of immunomodulator use and treatment lines. METHODS: Retrospective national population-based data on treatment persistence for adalimumab, infliximab vedolizumab and ustekinumab for CD and UC were analysed from the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme using Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: There were 2499 patients included with 8219 person-years of follow-up. In CD patients ustekinumab had increased persistence compared to anti-TNF agents (HR: 1.79, 95%CI: 1.32-2.38, P < 0.01). Twelve-month CD persistence rates were ustekinumab 80.0%, vedolizumab 73.5%, infliximab 68.1% and adalimumab 64.2% (P = 0.01). In moderate-severe UC vedolizumab had increased persistence compared to anti-TNF agents (HR: 1.67, 95% CI: 1.27-2.18 P < 0.001). Twelve-month UC persistence rates were vedolizumab 73.4%, infliximab 61.1% and adalimumab 45.5% (P < 0.001). Immunomodulator co-therapy did not significantly increase persistence in non-anti-TNF therapy (P > 0.05). Thiopurines increased persistence of anti-TNF agents in CD (P < 0.001) and UC (P = 0.03). Methotrexate co-therapy increased persistence of anti-TNF agents in CD (P = 0.001) only. First-line therapy was superior to non-first line in persistence (P < 0.001). In fistulising CD, the persistence of infliximab and adalimumab was not significantly different (P = 0.11). CONCLUSION: Persistence was highest in ustekinumab in CD and vedolizumab in UC. Factors which increased the persistence of biological agents are first-line therapy, and immunomodulator co-therapy in anti-TNF agent use.","Ko, Yanna; Paramsothy, Sudarshan; Yau, Yunki; Leong, Rupert W",Aliment. pharmacol. ther,572,16

In this retrospective cohort study, COVID-19 (227) and non-COVID-19 patients (260) were divided into four groups according to their vitamin D levels: Group I (0-10 ng/ml), Group II (10-20 ng/ml), Group III (20-30 ng/ml), and Group IV (vitamin D > 30 ng/ml). Laboratory test results and the radiological findings were evaluated. In addition, for comparative purposes, medical records of 1200 patients who had a hospital visit in the November 1, 2019-November 1, 2020 period for complaints due to reasons not related to COVID-19 were investigated for the availability of vitamin D measurements. This search yielded 260 patients with tested vitamin D levels. Vitamin D levels were below 30 ng/ml in 94.27% of 227 COVID-19-positive patients (average age, 46.32 ± 1.24 years [range, 20-80 years] and 56.54% women) while 93.07% of 260 non-COVID-19 patients (average age, 44.63 ± 1.30 years [range, 18-75 years] and 59.50% women) had vitamin D levels below 30 ng/ml. Nevertheless, very severe vitamin D deficiency (<10 ng/ml) was considerably more common in COVID-19 patients (44%) (average age, 44.15 ± 1.89 years [range, 23-80 years] and 57.57% women) than in non-COVID-19 ones (31%) (average age, 46.50 ± 2.21 years [range, 20-75 years] and 62.5% women). Among COVID-19-positive patients, the group with vitamin D levels of >30 ng/ml had significantly lower D-dimer and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, number levels, number of affected lung segments and shorter hospital stays. No difference was found among the groups in terms of age and gender distribution. Elevated vitamin D levels could decrease COVID-19 PCR positivity, D-dime and CRP levels and the number of affected lung segments in COVID-19-positive patients, thereby shortening the duration of hospital stays and alleviating the intensity of COVID-19.","Demir, Mustafa; Demir, Fadime; Aygun, Hatice",J. med. virol,572,26

Over a two-week period (16-30 March 2020), 150 cancer patients in Germany participated in this study. Validated instruments assessed demographic and medical data, depression and anxiety symptoms (PHQ-2, GAD-2), distress (DT), and health status (EQ-5D-3L). All instruments were adapted to measure the individual mental health before the COVID-19 outbreak. COVID-19-related fear, trust in governmental actions to face COVID-19, and the subjective level of information regarding COVID-19 were measured. Cancer patients showed a significant increase in depression and anxiety symptoms and distress, while health status deteriorated since the COVID-19 outbreak. Increased depression and generalized anxiety symptoms were predicted by COVID-19-related fear. Trust in governmental actions to face COVID-19 and COVID-19-related fear predicted increases in distress. Higher subjective levels of information predicted less increasing anxiety symptoms and distress. Present data suggests that cancer patients experienced a significant increase in mental health burden since the COVID-19 outbreak. Observed predictors of mental health impairment and protective factors should be addressed, and appropriate interventions established, to maintain mental health of cancer patients during the pandemic.","Bäuerle, Alexander; Musche, Venja; Schmidt, Kira; Schweda, Adam; Fink, Madeleine; Weismüller, Benjamin; Kohler, Hannah; Herrmann, Ken; Tewes, Mitra; Schadendorf, Dirk; Skoda, Eva-Maria; Teufel, Martin",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),572,16

METHODS: With nutritionist guidance, we developed a nutrition presentation for breast cancer patients. English- (n = 29) and Spanish-speaking (n = 19) patients were recruited from 5 safety-net hospitals, an academic cancer center, and a Latina cancer support organization. Materials were tested using multiple rounds of cognitive interviewing (with an adapted USDA interview guide), followed by study team reviews and modifications, until saturation. RESULTS: Seven rounds of interviews per language were needed. Approximately 25% of interviewees had less than a high school education. Changes included adapting to regional lexicons and resolving vague/confusing phrasing. Specific food examples needed cultural tailoring. Text color coding (red/bad, green/good) was requested. Labeled images enhanced participants' understanding of concepts. Spanish speakers expressed a desire to understand nutrition labeling, and this was emphasized in the Spanish slides. CONCLUSION: Cognitive interviews were an important tool for creating a nutrition curriculum tailored to the needs of low-literacy, mostly immigrant patients.

Our objective was to determine the risk factors for 28-days mortality in patients who received convalescent plasma for COVID-19 compared to those who did not, who were admitted to hospitals in Buenos Aires Province, Argentina, throughout the pandemic. METHODS: This is a multicenter, retrospective cohort study of 2-month duration beginning on June 1, 2020, including unselected, consecutive adult patients with diagnosed COVID-19, admitted to 215 hospitals with pneumonia. Epidemiological and clinical variables were registered in the Provincial Hospital Bed Management System. Convalescent plasma was supplied as part of a centralized, expanded access program. RESULTS: We analyzed 3,529 patients with pneumonia, predominantly male, aged 62±17, with arterial hypertension and diabetes as main comorbidities; 51.4% were admitted to the ward, 27.1% to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and 21.7% to the ICU with mechanical ventilation requirement (ICU-MV). 28-day mortality was 34.9%; and was 26.3%, 30.1% and 61.4% for ward, ICU and ICU-MV patients. Convalescent plasma was administered to 868 patients (24.6%); their 28-day mortality was significantly lower (25.5% vs. 38.0%, p<0.001). No major adverse effects occurred. Logistic regression analysis identified age, ICU admission with and without MV requirement, diabetes, and preexistent cardiovascular disease as independent predictors of 28-day mortality, whereas convalescent plasma administration acted as a protective factor.

For those whose labor has maintained, as well as those who seek to return to pre-COVID-19 labor conditions, a crude biopolitical calculus takes place where the functioning of our capitalist political economy is weighed against the maintenance of life itself. The current pandemic exposes and highlights many of the unsustainable fault lines characteristic of contemporary capitalism, where the uneven exploitation of labor renders lives associated with some labor functions as more expendable than others.

The aim of the study was to explore hematological and biochemical parameters at admission to the hospital as novel early predictors for diagnosis with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among all suspected patients. METHODS: This was a retrospective, multicenter, observational study. The clinical data of all suspected patients were analyzed. The suspected patients with negative RT-PCR results were included as the control group, and compared with confirmed patients. Receiver- operating characteristic (ROC) curves and logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the hematological indexes. RESULTS: In total, 326 confirmed COVID-19 patients and 116 control patients were included. The predictive ability of combinations of the hematological and biochemical parameters was significantly superior to that of a single parameter. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to neutrophil ratio index (ANRI) and the AST to monocyte ratio index (AMRI) were 0.791 and 0.812, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, an ANRI &#8805; 6.03(OR: 3.26, 95% CI: 1.02-10.40, P=0.046) and an AMRI &#8805; 36.32(OR: 3.64. 95% CI: 1.24-10.68, P=0.02) at admission were independent risk factors related to the occurrence of COVID-19.

This limitation is particularly concerning as preliminary data indicate that veterans may experience a higher rate of mortality compared to their civilian counterparts. One factor that may contribute to increased rates of death among veterans with COVID-19 is tobacco use. Indeed, findings from a recent meta-analysis highlight the association between lifetime smoking status and COVID-19 progression to more severe or critical conditions including death. Notably, prevalence rates of tobacco use are higher among veterans than civilians. Thus, the purpose of the current study was to examine demographic and medical variables that may contribute to likelihood of death among veterans testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, we examined the unique influence of lifetime tobacco use on veteran mortality when added to the complete model. Retrospective chart reviews were conducted on 440 veterans (80.5% African American/Black) who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (7.3% deceased) at a large, southeastern Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital between March 11, 2020 and April 23, 2020, with data analysis occurring from May 26, 2020 to June 5, 2020. Older age, male gender, immunodeficiency, endocrine, and pulmonary diseases were positively related to the relative risk of death among SARS-CoV-2 positive veterans, with lifetime tobacco use predicting veteran mortality above and beyond these variables.

By adopting a mixed methods approach drawing especially on in-depth interviews conducted with a range of independent business owners, the study reveals the dynamics between long-term residents and newcomers as they negotiate shared identities that continue to shape the present and future of some of Tokyo’s oldest neighbourhoods The research findings highlight the need for good urban governance to draw on an improved understanding of the potential of localities, place-based social capital building, and new social practices that are emerging in local third sectors, such as volunteer-run industry-based organizations, which are vital in maintaining informal networks as an alternative to more traditional neighbourhood groups to bond, bridge, and link diverse community members © 2021, Ljubljana University Press All rights reserved","Imai, H.; Ji, Y.",Asian Studies,572,20

Since older people are exposed to much higher death risks, older populations are expected to face much more difficult challenges coping with the pandemic. The urban/rural dimension turns out to be very important as the remote rural areas are also the oldest. In the map NUTS-3 regions of Europe are colored according to the deviation from European pooled estimate of the proportion of population at risk of death due to COVID-19. We assume that 5/6 of the populations get infected and experience age-specific infection-fatality ratios (IFRs) modelled by the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team. We adjust IFRs by sex ratios of age-specific case-fatality ratios observed in the European countries that are included in the COVerAGE-DB. Thus, we effectively introduce a summary measure of population age structures focused on the most vulnerable to the pandemic. Such an estimate for the total European population is 1%. The map reflects the unequal population age structures rather than the precise figures on COVID-19 fatality. It is a case-if scenario that highlights the possible effect of the population age structures, a demographic perspective. This analysis clearly shows the contribution of regional differences in population age structures to the magnitude of the pandemic - other things equal, we expect to see a four-fold variation in average regional infection-fatality ratios across Europe due only to differences in the population structures.","Kashnitsky, Ilya; Aburto, José Manuel",World Dev,572,33

Following a stochastic point process modelling approach, a Monte Carlo simulation model was developed to represent the COVID-19 spread dynamics. First, we examined various expected performances (theoretical properties) of the simulation model assuming a number of arbitrarily defined scenarios. Simulation studies were then performed on the real COVID-19 data reported (over the period of 1 March to 1 May) for Australia and United Kingdom (UK). Given the initial number of COVID-19 infection active cases were around 10 for both countries, the model estimated that the number of active cases would peak around 29 March in Australia (&#8776; 1,700 cases) and around 22 April in UK (&#8776; 22,860 cases); ultimately the total confirmed cases could sum to 6,790 for Australia in about 75 days and 206,480 for UK in about 105 days. The results of the estimated COVID-19 reproduction numbers were consistent with what was reported in the literature. This simulation model was considered an effective and adaptable decision making/what-if analysis tool in battling COVID-19 in the immediate need, and for modelling any other infectious diseases in the future.","Xie, Gang",Sci Rep,572,1

However, most of the current COVID-19 clinical practices and trials do not take the sex factor into consideration. METHODS: We performed a sex-based comparative analysis for the clinical outcomes, peripheral immune cells, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) specific antibody levels of 1558 males and 1499 females COVID-19 patients from a single center. The lymphocyte subgroups were measured by Flow cytometry. The total antibody, Spike protein (S)-, receptor binding domain (RBD)-, and nucleoprotein (N)- specific IgM and IgG levels were measured by chemiluminescence. RESULTS: We found that male patients had approximately two-fold rates of ICU admission (4.7% vs. 2.7% in males and females, respectively, P = 0.005) and mortality (3% vs. 1.4%, in males and females, respectively, P = 0.004) than female patients. Survival analysis revealed that the male sex is an independent risk factor for death from COVID-19 (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 2.22, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3-3.6, P = 0.003). The level of inflammatory cytokines in peripheral blood was higher in males during hospitalization. The renal (102/1588 [6.5%] vs. 63/1499 [4.2%], in males and females, respectively, P = 0.002) and hepatic abnormality (650/1588 [40.9%] vs. 475/1499 [31.7%], P = 0.003) were more common in male patients than in female patients. By analyzing dynamic changes of lymphocyte subsets after symptom onset, we found that the percentage of CD19+ B cells and CD4+ T cells was generally higher in female patients during the disease course of COVID-19. Notably, the protective RBD-specific IgG against SARS-CoV-2 sharply increased and reached a peak in the fourth week after symptom onset in female patients, while gradually increased and reached a peak in the seventh week after symptom onset in male patients. CONCLUSIONS: Males had an unfavorable prognosis, higher inflammation, a lower percentage of lymphocytes, and indolent antibody responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection and recovery.

The latter suggests the presence of a possible sex-dependent susceptibility. An enzymatic system involved in this different predisposition could be represented by angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 is activated and down-regulated by the spike protein of the virus and allows the penetration of SARS-CoV-2 into epithelial cells and myocardium. Data on the experimental animal have shown that 17ß-estradiol increases the expression and activity of ACE2 in both adipose tissue and kidney. Spontaneously hypertensive male mice have a higher myocardial ACE2 expression than females and its levels decrease after orchiectomy. In addition to this first aspect, the recent evidence of an increased frequency of venous thromboembolism in patients with COVID-19 (a clinical element associated with a worse prognosis) calls the attention on the safety of treatment with testosterone, in particular in hypogonadal men with greater genetic predisposition. Evidence that sex hormones are able to modulate the expression of ACE2 could help in interpreting epidemiological results and in designing more appropriate intervention strategies. Moreover, the vitamin D deficiency in elderly men may be worthy of further study regarding the epidemiological aspects of this different susceptibility and lethality between sexes.","La Vignera, Sandro; Cannarella, Rossella; Condorelli, Rosita A; Torre, Francesco; Aversa, Antonio; Calogero, Aldo E",,572,32

METHODS: A pixel-based analysis of pre-treatment CT perfusion (CTP) was undertaken to define the optimum CTP permeability thresholds to predict the likelihood of HT. We then compared previously proposed predictors of HT using regression analyses and receiver operator characteristic curve analysis to produce an Area Under the Cure (AUC), and compared AUCs using Chi Square analysis. RESULTS: From 5 centres, 1407 patients were included in this study, 282 had HT. The cohort was split into a derivation (1025, 70% patients) and validation cohort (382 patients or 30%). The E permeability map at a threshold of 30% relative to contralateral had the highest AUC at predicting any HT (derivation AUC 0.85, 95% CI, 0.79-0.91, validation AUC 0.84, 95% CI, 0.77-0.91). The AUC improved when permeability was assessed within the acute perfusion lesion for the E maps at a threshold of 30% (derivation AUC 0.91, 95% CI, 0.86-0.95, validation AUC 0.89, 95% CI, 0.86-0.95). Previously proposed associations with HT and PH showed lower AUC values than the permeability measure.

In the context of machine learning, previous studies have explored supervised algorithms to predict and support diagnosis based on several clinical parameters from patients diagnosed with and without COVID-19. However, in most of them the decision is based on a ""black-box"" method, making it impossible to discover the variable relevance in decision making. Hence, in this study, we introduce a non-supervised clustering analysis with neural network self-organizing maps (SOM) as a strategy of decision-making. We propose to identify potential variables in routine blood tests that can support clinician decision-making during COVID-19 diagnosis at hospital admission, facilitating rapid medical intervention. Based on SOM features (visual relationships between clusters and identification of patterns and behaviors), and using linear discriminant analysis , it was possible to detect a group of units of the map with a discrimination power around 83% to SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. In addition, we identified some variables in admission blood tests (Leukocytes, Basophils, Eosinophils, and Red cell Distribution Width) that, in combination had strong influence in the clustering performance, which could assist a possible clinical decision. Thus, although with limitations, we believe that SOM can be used as a soft-computing approach to support clinician decision-making in the context of COVID-19.","Souza, Alexandra A de; Almeida, Danilo Candido de; Barcelos, Thiago S; Bortoletto, Rodrigo Campos; Munoz, Roberto; Waldman, Helio; Goes, Miguel Angelo; Silva, Leandro A",Soft comput,572,16

The transcriptional response to glucocorticoids is elicited by the Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR), which enters the nucleus upon Dex treatment and interacts with thousands of enhancer elements throughout the genome. We recently demonstrated that the Dex response in human breast cancer cells is highly heterogeneous and that individual cells have unique transcriptional responses to Dex. To examine whether this heterogeneity arises from differential utilization of distinct GR-bound enhancers, we focused on the Dex response at the DNA Damage Inducible Transcript 4 (DDIT4) gene. Using a variety of genomic techniques, we identified four GR binding sites (GBSs) 18-30kb upstream of the DDIT4 TSS with differential patterns of chromatin accessibility, histone acetylation, SWI/SNF recruitment, and enhancer RNA (eRNA) transcription. To determine whether these GBSs had unique requirements for DDIT4 transcription, we used CRISPR-CAS9 to generate homozygous deletions of each site. Using ChIP-seq, 4C-seq, single molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (smFISH), and RT-PCR, we demonstrated GR binding to these GBSs was independent and each GBS deletion had unique effects on DDIT4 and eRNA transcription, local histone acetylation, and chromatin looping. Deletion of any of the first three GBSs resulted in delayed and/or decreased induction of DDIT4 transcription whereas deletion of the fourth GBS resulted in significant upregulation of both DDIT4 and eRNA transcription. Thus, three of the GBSs acted as enhancers of DDIT4 expression while the fourth functioned as a suppressor. Strikingly, smFISH also revealed that these enhancers contributed to cellular heterogeneity, as deleting the GBSs altered the frequency and amplitude of DDIT4 transcription across cell populations. Taken together, these results demonstrate that individual GBSs uniquely contribute to cell-to-cell heterogeneity within the transcriptional response of DDIT4 to Dex. Furthermore, they underscore the possibility that targeted modification of individual GBSs could be utilized to tailor custom, patient-specific strategies for the treatment of human diseases.","Hoffman, Jackson Andrew Trotter Kevin W.; Day, Christopher R.; Ward, James M.; Rodriguez, Joseph Archer Trevor K.",Journal of the Endocrine Society,572,16

After dividing patients into suspicious and non-suspicious groups for COVID-19 infection based on their clinical manifestation, they were investigated for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM and IgG screening against nucleoprotein (NP), spike protein (SP), and receptor-binding domain (RBD), utilizing our recently developed ELISA tests.Results: We found that approximately 10.1% of asymptomatically tested cases were antibody positive. Although IgG positivity showed a higher prevalence than IgM across all three virus antigen subunits, there were no significant differences among mentioned immunoglobulins of the studied groups. The most prevalent antibody was from the IgG subtype against virus nucleoprotein (NP), while the lowest prevalence was attributed to receptor-binding domain (RBD) IgM.Conclusion: High seropositive rate among asymptomatic end-stage renal disease patients, as a sample of high-risk population, reflected the importance of considering SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody screening for disease containment.","Etemadi, Jalal; Bordbar, Shima; Soltani-Zangbar, Mohammad Sadegh; Hajivalili, Mahsa; Aghebati-Maleki, Leili; Motavalli, Roza; Mahmoodpoor, Ata; Shahmohammadi-Farid, Sima; Abedi Azar, Sima; Niknafs, Bahram; Roshangar, Leila; Babaloo, Zohreh; Ahmadian Heris, Javad; Hosseini, Maryam; Shareghi-Oskoue, Oldouz; Parhizkar, Forough; Khosroshahi, Hamid Tayebi; Yousefi, Mehdi",Immunol Invest,572,16

We performed an umbrella review to clarify and determine the associations between tea consumption and various types of cancer by summarizing and recalculating the existing meta-analyses. Meta-analyses of observational studies reporting associations between tea consumption and cancer risk were searched on PubMed and Embase. Associations found to be statistically significant were further classified into levels of evidence (convincing, suggestive, or weak), based on P value, between-study heterogeneity, prediction intervals, and small study effects. Sixty-four observational studies (case-control or cohort) corresponding to 154 effect sizes on the incidence of 25 types of cancer were included. Forty-three (27.9%) results in 15 different types of cancer were statistically significant. When combining all studies on the same type of cancer, 19 results in 11 different types of cancer showed significant associations with lower risk of gastrointestinal tract organ cancer (oral, gastric, colorectal, biliary tract, and liver cancer), breast cancer, and gynecological cancer (endometrial and ovarian cancer) as well as leukemia, lung cancer, and thyroid cancer. Only the reduced risk of oral cancer in tea-consuming populations (OR = 0.62; 95% CI: 0.55, 0.72; P value < 10-6) was supported by convincing evidence. Suggestive evidence was found for 6 results on biliary tract, breast, endometrial, liver, and oral cancer. To summarize, tea consumption was shown to have protective effects on some types of cancer, particularly oral cancer. More well-designed prospective studies are needed with consideration of other factors that can cause biases.","Kim, Tai Lim; Jeong, Gwang Hun; Yang, Jae Won; Lee, Keum Hwa; Kronbichler, Andreas; van der Vliet, Hans J; Grosso, Giuseppe; Galvano, Fabio; Aune, Dagfinn; Kim, Jong Yeob; Veronese, Nicola; Stubbs, Brendon; Solmi, Marco; Koyanagi, Ai; Hong, Sung Hwi; Dragioti, Elena; Cho, Eunyoung; de Rezende, Leandro F M; Giovannucci, Edward L; Shin, Jae Il; Gamerith, Gabriele","Adv. nutr.

Its containment represents a unique challenge for India due to a large population (>1.38 billion) across a wide range of population densities. Assessment of the COVID-19 disease burden is required to put the disease impact into context and support future pandemic policy development. Here, we present the national-level burden of COVID-19 in India in 2020 that accounts for differences across urban and rural regions and across age groups. Disability-adjusted life years (DALY) due to COVID-19 were estimated in the Indian population in 2020, comprised of years of life lost (YLL) and years lived with disability (YLD). Scenario analyses were conducted to account for excess deaths not recorded in the official data and for reported COVID-19 deaths. The direct impact of COVID-19 in 2020 in India was responsible for 14,106,060 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 14,030,129-14,213,231) DALYs, consisting of 99.2% (95% UI 98.47-99.64%) YLLs and 0.80% (95% UI 0.36-1.53) YLDs. DALYs were higher in urban (56%; 95% UI 56-57%) than rural areas (44%; 95% UI 43.4-43.6) and in males (64%) than females (36%). In absolute terms, the highest DALYs occurred in the 51-60-year-old age group (28%) but the highest DALYs per 100,000 persons were estimated for the 71-80 year old age group (5,481; 95% UI 5,464-5,500 years). There were 4,823,791 (95% UI 4,760,908-4,924,307) DALYs after considering reported COVID-19 deaths only. The DALY estimations have direct and immediate implications not only for public policy in India, but also internationally given that India represents one sixth of the worlds population.","Singh, Balbir Bagicha; Devleesschauwer, Brecht; Khatkar, Mehar S; Lowerison, Mark; Singh, Baljit; Dhand, Navneet K; Barkema, Herman W",,572,29

Opioid agonist treatment (OAT) can be effective in reducing illicit opioid use and fatal overdose, and improving multiple health and social outcomes. Despite evidence for its effectiveness, there are significant deficits in OAT globally. COVID-19 has required rapid adaptation of remote models of healthcare. Telemedicine is not used routinely in OAT, and little is known about the current levels of use and effectiveness. The objective of this review is to describe models of telemedicine and their efficacy. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This scoping review uses the review methodology described by Arksey and O'Malley and adapted by Levac et al. The search strategy developed by the medical librarian at the Irish College of General Practitioners in conjunction with the research team will involve five databases (PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, PsycInfo and OpenGrey) and the hand searching of reference lists. A limited initial search of two databases will be completed to refine search terms, followed by a second comprehensive search using newly refined search terms of all databases and finally hand searching references of included studies. To be included, studies must report on remote ways of providing OAT (including assessment, induction and monitoring) or related psychosocial support; be published in English after 2010. Two researchers will independently screen titles, abstracts and full-text articles considered for inclusion. Data will be extracted onto an agreed template and will undergo a descriptive analysis of the contextual or process-oriented data and simple quantitative analysis using descriptive statistics. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Research ethics approval is not required for this scoping review. The results of this scoping review will inform the development of a national remote model of OAT. The results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at relevant conferences.","Crowley, Des; Homeniuk, Robyn; Delargy, Ide",BMJ Open,572,16

So keeping these issues in mind a new Android Application based Smart Bus Transportation System was introduced which guides the passengers in booking the bus tickets using the Android Application and it also helps the passengers to keep an update on bus location based on their request. This system also sends alert message few minutes in advance to the passengers before the bus reaches the passengers boarding point. This system also sends the precautionary instruction priorly to the passengers that have to be followed while travelling in the bus.

Although the community-wide implementation of basic non-pharmaceutical intervention measures, such as social distancing, quarantine of suspected COVID-19 cases, isolation of confirmed cases, use of face masks in public, contact tracing and testing, have been quite effective in curtailing and mitigating the burden of the pandemic, it is universally believed that the use of a vaccine may be necessary to effectively curtail and eliminating COVID-19 in human populations. This study is based on the use of a mathematical model for assessing the impact of a hypothetical imperfect anti-COVID-19 vaccine on the control of COVID-19 in the United States. An analytical expression for the minimum percentage of unvaccinated susceptible individuals needed to be vaccinated in order to achieve vaccine-induced community herd immunity is derived. The epidemiological consequence of the herd immunity threshold is that the disease can be effectively controlled or eliminated if the minimum herd immunity threshold is achieved in the community. Simulations of the model, using baseline parameter values obtained from fitting the model with COVID-19 mortality data for the U.S., show that, for an anti-COVID-19 vaccine with an assumed protective efficacy of 80%, at least 82% of the susceptible US population need to be vaccinated to achieve the herd immunity threshold. The prospect of COVID-19 elimination in the US, using the hypothetical vaccine, is greatly enhanced if the vaccination program is combined with other interventions, such as face mask usage and/or social distancing. Such combination of strategies significantly reduces the level of the vaccine-induced herd immunity threshold needed to eliminate the pandemic in the US. For instance, the herd immunity threshold decreases to 72% if half of the US population regularly wears face masks in public (the threshold decreases to 46% if everyone wears a face mask).","Iboi, Enahoro A.; Ngonghala, Calistus N.; Gumel, Abba B.",Infect.

Validations of these have been performed with a limited number of samples. The lack of standardisation might lead to significantly different results. This study compared ten automated assays from six vendors in terms of sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility. METHODS: This study compared ten fully automated immunoassays from the following vendors: Diasorin, Epitope Diagnostics, Euroimmun, Roche, YHLO, and Snibe. The retrospective part of the study included patients with a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection, and controls comprised patients with a suspected infection, in whom the disease was excluded. Furthermore, biobanked sera were taken as negative controls (n = 97). The retrospective part involved four groups: (1) laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection (n = 183); (1B) suspected COVID-19 infection (n = 167) without a qRT-PCR result but positive serological results from at least two different assays, and suspected COVID-19 infection due to a positive serological result from the Roche assay (n = 295); (2) biobanked sera obtained from patients before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 (n = 97) as negative controls; and (2A) probably COVID-19-negative sera with negative serological results from at least two different assays (n = 152). RESULTS: Overall diagnostic sensitivities were: Euroimmun (IgA) 87%; Epitope Diagnostics (IgG) 83%; YHLO (IgG) 77%; Roche (IgM/IgG) 77%; Euroimmun (IgG) 75%; Diasorin (IgG) 53%; Epitope Diagnostics (IgM) 52%; Snibe (IgG) 47%; YHLO (IgM) 35%; and Snibe (IgM) 26%.

Early detection of COVID-19 patients is an important issue for treating and controlling the disease from spreading. In this paper, a new strategy for detecting COVID-19 infected patients will be introduced, which is called Distance Biased Naïve Bayes (DBNB). The novelty of DBNB as a proposed classification strategy is concentrated in two contributions. The first is a new feature selection technique called Advanced Particle Swarm Optimization (APSO) which elects the most informative and significant features for diagnosing COVID-19 patients. APSO is a hybrid method based on both filter and wrapper methods to provide accurate and significant features for the next classification phase. The considered features are extracted from Laboratory findings for different cases of people, some of whom are COVID-19 infected while some are not. APSO consists of two sequential feature selection stages, namely; Initial Selection Stage (IS2) and Final Selection Stage (FS2). IS2 uses filter technique to quickly select the most important features for diagnosing COVID-19 patients while removing the redundant and ineffective ones. This behavior minimizes the computational cost in FS2, which is the next stage of APSO. FS2 uses Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO) as a wrapper method for accurate feature selection. The second contribution of this paper is a new classification model, which combines evidence from statistical and distance based classification models. The proposed classification technique avoids the problems of the traditional NB and consists of two modules; Weighted Naïve Bayes Module (WNBM) and Distance Reinforcement Module (DRM). The proposed DBNB tries to accurately detect infected patients with the minimum time penalty based on the most effective features selected by APSO. DBNB has been compared with recent COVID-19 diagnose strategies. Experimental results have shown that DBNB outperforms recent COVID-19 diagnose strategies as it introduce the maximum accuracy with the minimum time penalty.","Shaban, Warda M; Rabie, Asmaa H; Saleh, Ahmed I; Abo-Elsoud, M A",Pattern Recognit,572,22

Objective: To determine if cell phone location data are associated with the rate of change in new COVID-19 cases by county across the US. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study incorporated publicly available county-level daily COVID-19 case data from January 22, 2020, to May 11, 2020, and county-level daily cell phone location data made publicly available by Google. It examined the daily cases of COVID-19 per capita and daily estimates of cell phone activity compared with the baseline (where baseline was defined as the median value for that day of the week from a 5-week period between January 3 and February 6, 2020). All days and counties with available data after the initiation of stay-at-home orders for each state were included. Exposures: The primary exposure was cell phone activity compared with baseline for each day and each county in different categories of place. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the percentage change in COVID-19 cases 5 days from the exposure date. Results: Between 949 and 2740 US counties and between 22â¯124 and 83â¯745 daily observations were studied depending on the availability of cell phone data for that county and day. Marked changes in cell phone activity occurred around the time stay-at-home orders were issued by various states. Counties with higher per-capita cases (per 100â¯000 population) showed greater reductions in cell phone activity at the workplace (ß, -0.002; 95% CI, -0.003 to -0.001; P < 0.001), areas classified as retail (ß, -0.008; 95% CI, -0.011 to -0.005; P < 0.001) and grocery stores (ß, -0.006; 95% CI, -0.007 to -0.004; P < 0.001), and transit stations (ß, -0.003, 95% CI, -0.005 to -0.002; P < 0.001), and greater increase in activity at the place of residence (ß, 0.002; 95% CI, 0.001-0.002; P < 0.001). Adjusting for county-level and state-level characteristics, counties with the greatest decline in workplace activity, transit stations, and retail activity and the greatest increases in time spent at residential places had lower percentage growth in cases at 5, 10, and 15 days. For example, counties in the lowest quartile of retail activity had a 45.5% lower growth in cases at 15 days compared with the highest quartile (SD, 37.4%-53.5%; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: Our findings support the hypothesis that greater reductions in cell phone activity in the workplace and retail locations, and greater increases in activity at the residence, are associated with lesser growth in COVID-19 cases. These data provide support for the value of monitoring cell phone location data to anticipate future trends of the pandemic.","Sehra, Shiv T; George, Michael; Wiebe, Douglas J; Fundin, Shelby; Baker, Joshua F",JAMA intern. med.

However, the pandemic led to the wide use of face masks, essential to keep the pandemic under control. The effect of wearing a mask on face recognition in a collaborative environment is currently sensitive yet understudied issue. Recent reports have tackled this by evaluating the masked probe effect on the performance of automatic face recognition solutions. However, such solutions can fail in certain processes, leading to performing the verification task by a human expert. This work provides a joint evaluation and in-depth analyses of the face verification performance of human experts in comparison to state-of-the-art automatic face recognition solutions. This involves an extensive evaluation with 12 human experts and 4 automatic recognition solutions. The study concludes with a set of take-home messages on different aspects of the correlation between the verification behavior of human and machine.","Damer, Naser; Boutros, Fadi; Sussmilch, Marius; Fang, Meiling; Kirchbuchner, Florian; Kuijper, Arjan",,572,21

The spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 mediates entry of virus into the host cell and is one of the most important antigenic determinants, making it a potential candidate for a vaccine. In this study, we have computationally designed a multi-epitope vaccine using spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. The overall quality of the candidate vaccine was validated in silico and Molecular Dynamics Simulation confirmed the stability of the designed vaccine. Docking studies revealed stable interactions of the vaccine with Toll-Like Receptors and MHC Receptors. The in silico cloning and codon optimization supported the proficient expression of the designed vaccine in E. coli expression system. The efficiency of the candidate vaccine to trigger an effective immune response was assessed by an in silico immune simulation. The computational analyses suggest that the designed multi-epitope vaccine is structurally stable which can induce specific immune responses and thus, can be a potential vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2.","Kar, Tamalika; Narsaria, Utkarsh; Basak, Srijita; Deb, Debashrito; Castiglione, Filippo; Mueller, David M; Srivastava, Anurag P",Sci Rep,572,10

United Arab Emirates (UAE), largely being an oil-driven economy witnessed a contraction in its GDP in 2020. While the UAE is still to assess the total economic and social costs of the pandemic, many businesses seem to have got highly affected and some of them might be on the verge of getting wiped off from the market. Consequently, unemployment might upsurge resulting in increasing number of people falling into the poverty trap. Thus, it is essential for the government and businesses in the UAE to explore possible alternatives to revive the economy. Even though vaccination has started, it is only in the initial stage and another wave of Covid-19 could be anytime possibility. As such, this study attempts to understand the impact of Covid-19 on the UAE’s economic environment along with major sectors that have gained or got distressed in the pandemic. Also, it reviews the existing literature on post-disaster business recovery strategies and identifies the comprehensive framework that could aid the UAE in reviving its economy and businesses. The framework highlighted in this study focuses on the collective action of both government and businesses to fight against the pandemic. It guides the economic recovery via building trust among the people, creating an entrepreneurial and startup ecosystem, learning from small business recovery plans and infusing financial stimulus to create a much needed sustainable and resilient business environment. © 2021","Kumar, P.; Seshadri, U.; Paramaiah, C.",Academy of Strategic Management Journal,572,6

The indispensable role of the main protease (Mpro) in viral replication and gene expression makes this enzyme an attractive drug target. Therefore, inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro as a proposition to halt virus ingression is being pursued by scientists globally. Here we carried out a study with two objectives: the first being to perform comparative protein sequence and 3D structural analysis to understand the effect of 12 point mutations on the active site. Among these, two mutations, viz., Ser46 and Phe134, were found to cause a significant change at the active sites of SARS-CoV-2. The Ser46 mutation present at the entrance of the S5 subpocket of SARS-CoV-2 increases the contribution of other two hydrophilic residues, while the Phe134 mutation, present in the catalytic cysteine loop, can cause an increase in catalytic efficiency of Mpro by facilitating fast proton transfer from the Cys145 to His41 residue. It was observed that active site remained conserved among Mpro of both SARS-CoVs, except at the entrance of the S5 subpocket, suggesting sustenance of substrate specificity. The second objective was to screen the inhibitory effects of three different data sets (natural products, coronaviruses main protease inhibitors, and FDA-approved drugs) using a structure-based virtual screening approach. A total of 73 hits had a combo score >2.0. Eight different structural scaffold classes were identified, such as one/two tetrahydropyran ring(s), dipeptide/tripeptide/oligopeptide, large (approximately 20 atoms) cyclic peptide, and miscellaneous. The screened hits showed key interactions with subpockets of the active site. Further, molecular dynamics studies of selected screened compounds confirmed their perfect fitting into the subpockets of the active site. This study suggests promising structures that can fit into the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro active site and also offers direction for further lead optimization and rational drug design.","Gahlawat, Anuj; Kumar, Navneet; Kumar, Rajender; Sandhu, Hardeep; Singh, Inder Pal; Singh, Saranjit; Sjöstedt, Anders; Garg, Prabha",J. chem. inf. model,572,16

To date, the SARS-CoV-2 spread has already become a global pandemic with a considerable death toll. The associated symptoms of the COVID-19 infection varied with increased inflammation as an everyday pathological basis. Among various other symptoms such as fever, cough, lethargy, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms included diarrhea and IBD with colitis, have been reported. Currently, there is no sole cure for COVID-19, and researchers are actively engaged to search out appropriate treatment and develop a vaccine for its prevention. Antiviral for controlling viral load and corticosteroid therapy for reducing inflammation seems to be inadequate to control the fatality rate. Based on the available related literature, which documented GI symptoms with diarrhea, inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) with colitis, and increased deaths in the intensive care unit (ICU), conclude that dysbiosis occurs during SARS-COV-2 infection as the gut-lung axis cannot be ignored. As probiotics play a therapeutic role for GI, IBD, colitis, and even in viral infection. So, we assume that the inclusion of studies to investigate gut microbiome and subsequent therapies such as probiotics might help decrease the inflammatory response of viral pathogenesis and respiratory symptoms by strengthening the host immune system, amelioration of gut microbiome, and improvement of gut barrier function.","Din, Ahmad Ud; Mazhar, Maryam; Waseem, Muhammed; Ahmad, Waqar; Bibi, Asma; Hassan, Adil; Ali, Niaz; Gang, Wang; Qian, Gao; Ullah, Razi; Shah, Tariq; Ullah, Mehraj; Khan, Israr; Nisar, Muhammad Farrukh; Wu, Jianbo",Biomed Pharmacother,572,16

Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) have been postulated to play a key role in treating ovarian ageing. METHODS: We used macaque ovarian ageing models to observe the structural and functional changes after juvenile BMMSC treatment. Moreover, RNA-seq was used to analyse the ovarian transcriptional expression profile and key pathways through which BMMSCs reverse ovarian ageing. RESULTS: In the elderly macaque models, the ovaries were atrophied, the regulation ability of sex hormones was reduced, the ovarian structure was destroyed, and only local atretic follicles were observed, in contrast with young rhesus monkeys. Intravenous infusion of BMMSCs in elderly macaques increased ovarian volume, strengthened the regulation ability of sex hormones, reduced the degree of pulmonary fibrosis, inhibited apoptosis, increased density of blood vessels, and promoted follicular regeneration. In addition, the ovarian expression characteristics of ageing-related genes of the elderly treatment group reverted to that of the young control group, 1258 genes that were differentially expressed, among which 415 genes upregulated with age were downregulated, 843 genes downregulated with age were upregulated after BMMSC treatment, and the top 20 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network were significantly enriched in oocyte meiosis and progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation pathways. CONCLUSION: The BMMSCs derived from juvenile macaques can reverse ovarian ageing in elderly macaques.","Tian, Chuan; He, Jie; An, Yuanyuan; Yang, Zailing; Yan, Donghai; Pan, Hang; Lv, Guanke; Li, Ye; Wang, Yanying; Yang, Yukun; Zhu, Gaohong; He, Zhixu; Zhu, Xiangqing; Pan, Xinghua",Stem Cell Res Ther,572,8

In this paper, we define a general class of OTOC, which can perfectly capture quantum randomness phenomena in a better way. Further we demonstrate an equivalent formalism of computation using a general time independent Hamiltonian having well defined eigenstate representation for integrable supersymmetric quantum systems. We found that one needs to consider two new correlators apart from the usual one to have a complete quantum description. To visualize the impact of the given formalism we consider the two well known models viz. Harmonic Oscillator and one dimensional potential well within the framework of supersymmetry. For the Harmonic Oscillator case we obtain similar periodic time dependence but dissimilar parameter dependences compared to the results obtained from both micro-canonical and canonical ensembles in quantum mechanics without supersymmetry. On the other hand, for one dimensional potential well problem we found significantly different time scale and the other parameter dependence compared to the results obtained from non-supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Finally, to establish the consistency of the prescribed formalism in the classical limit, we demonstrate the phase space averaged version of the classical version of OTOCs from a model independent Hamiltonian along with the previously mentioned these well cited models.","Bhagat, Kaushik Y.; Bose, Baibhab; Choudhury, Sayantan; Chowdhury, Satyaki; Das, Rathindra N.; Dastider, Saptarshhi G.; Gupta, Nitin; Maji, Archana; Pasquino, Gabriel D.; Paul, Swaraj",,572,1

Co-crystal structures of two IGHV3-53-neutralizing antibodies with RBD, with or without Fab CR3022, at 2.33- to 3.20-angstrom resolution revealed that the germline-encoded residues dominate recognition of the angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-binding site. This binding mode limits the IGHV3-53 antibodies to short complementarity-determining region H3 loops but accommodates light-chain diversity.

A growing number of studies have reported gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. We performed a systematic review of GI symptoms associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as well as of the serum levels of biomarkers related to liver function and lesion in SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals. METHODS: We surveyed relevant articles published in English, Spanish, and Portuguese up to July, 2020 in the PubMed, MEDLINE, SciELO, LILACS, and BVS databases. Moreover, we surveyed potentially important articles in journals such as the NEJM, JAMA, BMJ, Gut, and AJG. RESULTS: This systematic review included 43 studies, including 18,246 patients. Diarrhea was the most common GI symptom, affecting 11.5% of the patients, followed by nausea and vomiting (6.3%) and abdominal pain (2.3%). With regard to clinical severity, 17.5% of the patients were classified as severely ill, whereas 9.8% of them were considered to have a non-severe disease. Some studies showed increased aspartate transaminase and alanine aminotransferase levels in a portion of the 209 analyzed patients and two studies. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that digestive symptoms are common in COVID-19 patients. In addition, alterations in cytolysis biomarkers could also be observed in a lesser proportion, calling attention to the possibility of hepatic involvement in SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals.","Silva, Filipe Antônio França da; Brito, Breno Bittencourt de; Santos, Maria Luísa Cordeiro; Marques, Hanna Santos; Silva Júnior, Ronaldo Teixeira da; Carvalho, Lorena Sousa de; Vieira, Elise Santos; Oliveira, Márcio Vasconcelos; Melo, Fabrício Freire de",Rev.

COVID-19 primarily targets the human respiratory epithelium but also has neuro-invasive potential. Indeed, neuropsychiatric manifestations, such as fatigue, febrile seizures, psychiatric symptoms, and delirium, are consistently observed in COVID-19. The neurobiological basis of neuropsychiatric COVID-19 symptoms is not fully understood. However, previous evidence about systemic viral infections pointed to an ongoing neuroinflammatory response to viral antigens and proinflammatory mediators/immune cells from the periphery. Microglia cells mediate the overproduction of inflammatory cytokines, free radicals, and damage signals, culminating with neurotoxic consequences. Semi-synthetic second-generation tetracyclines, including minocycline (MINO) and doxycycline (DOXY), are safe bacteriostatic agents that have remarkable neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties. Promising results have been obtained in clinical trials using tetracyclines for major psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and major depression. Tetracyclines can inhibit microglial reactivity and neuroinflammation by inhibiting nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) signaling, cyclooxygenase 2, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). This drug class also has a broad profile of activity against bacteria associated with community-based pneumonia, including atypical agents. COVID-19 patients are susceptible to secondary bacterial infections, especially those on invasive ventilation. Therefore, we suggest tetracyclines' repurposing as a potential treatment for COVID-19 neuropsychiatric manifestations. These drugs can represent a valuable multi-modal treatment for COVID-19-associated neuroinflammatory alterations based on their broad antimicrobial profile and neuroinflammation control.","Chaves Filho, Adriano José Maia; Gonçalves, Franciane; Mottin, Melina; Andrade, Carolina Horta; Fonseca, Silvia Nunes Szente; Macedo, Danielle S",J. neuroimmune pharmacol,572,0

These syncytia are thought to facilitate replication and evasion of the host immune response. Here, we report that co-culture of human cells expressing the receptor ACE2 with cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike, results in synapse-like intercellular contacts that initiate cell-cell fusion, producing syncytia resembling those we identify in lungs of COVID-19 patients. To assess the mechanism of spike/ACE2-driven membrane fusion, we developed a microscopy-based, cell-cell fusion assay to screen ~6000 drugs and >30 spike variants. Together with quantitative cell biology approaches, the screen reveals an essential role for biophysical aspects of the membrane, particularly cholesterol-rich regions, in spike-mediated fusion, which extends to replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 isolates.

The objective of this study was to explore the influencing factors associated with self-reported psychological distress among a sample of PCPs in China in relation to COVID-19. METHODS: An online survey was distributed to a sample of PCPs in Chengdu city between February 10 and February 13, 2020. The survey consisted of three sections: demographic characteristics, COVID-19-related questions, and the General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12). After 5 months, a follow-up survey investigating the change of the GHQ-12 was conducted. RESULTS: A total of 712 PCPs completed the baseline survey (11.8% of those invited), 55.6% were female and 74.4% were aged between 30 and 49 years. High levels of psychological distress (GHQ-12 &#8805;3) were observed in 29.2% and were associated with low preparedness, high work impact, working with infected residents, personal life impact, and concerns, as well as older age and being married (p values < .05). Logistic regression analysis showed that psychological distress was associated with low preparedness (odds ratio [OR] = 0.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.87-0.96), high work impact (OR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.03-1.20), personal life impact (OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.07-1.17), and safety-related concerns (OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.02-1.16). At the 5-month assessment point, high psychological distress was less frequent (21.8%). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has resulted in high levels of distress in approximately 30% of PCPs in China. Factors associated with high psychological distress levels include low preparedness and high levels of work impact, personal life impact, and concerns. These findings highlight the importance of enhancing psychological health throughout the course of infectious pandemics.","Zeng, Xin; Peng, Tao; Hao, Xiaofei; Zou, Chuan; Lin, Kai; Liao, Xiaoyang; Chen, Shanping; Hayhoe, Benedict",Psychosom Med,572,20

Since the lockdown, screening examinations and routine checkups have been restricted to prevent the spread of the virus and to increase the hospitals' bed capacity across the country. This resulted in a severe decline of patient referrals to the hospitals. OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the rate of newly diagnosed gynecological and breast cancers in Austria. METHODS: Data of 2077 patients from 18 centers in Austria with newly diagnosed gynecological or breast cancer between January and May 2019 and January and May 2020 were collected. Clinical parameters, including symptoms, performance status, co-morbidities, and referral status, were compared between the time before and after the COVID-19 outbreak. RESULTS: Our results showed a slight increase of newly diagnosed cancers in January and February 2020 as compared with 2019 (+2 and +35%, respectively) and a strong decline in newly diagnosed tumors since the lockdown: -24% in March 2020 versus March 2019, -49% in April 2020 versus April 2019, -49% in May 2020 versus May 2019. Two-thirds of patients diagnosed during the pandemic presented with tumor-specific symptoms compared with less than 50% before the pandemic (p<0.001). Moreover, almost 50% of patients in 2020 had no co-morbidities compared with 35% in 2019 (p<0.001). Patients, who already had a malignant disease, were rarely diagnosed with a new cancer in 2020 as compared with 2019 (11% vs 6%; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The lockdown led to a decreased number of newly diagnosed gynecological and breast cancers. The decreased accessibility of the medical services and postponed diagnosis of potentially curable cancers during the COVID-19 pandemic may be a step backwards in our healthcare system and might impair cancer treatment outcomes. Therefore, new strategies to manage early cancer detection are needed to optimize cancer care in a time of pandemic in the future.","Tsibulak, Irina; Reiser, Elisabeth; Bogner, Gerhard; Petru, Edgar; Hell-Teutsch, Johanna; Reinthaller, Alexander; Weirather, Cornelia; Weiss, Tatjana; Bozsa, Szabolcs; Puschacher, Barbara; Hall, Mirijam; Hittler, Doris; Hrauda, Katharina; Thell, Elisabeth; Clauss, Sabine; Pozniak, Johanna; Alicke, Sebastian; Gangl, Daniela; Gamperl, Gottfried; Ebner, Christoph; Knoll, Katharina; Leitner, Katharina; Schilcher, Andrea; Schinnerl, Marina; Sigl, Verena; Singer, Christian; Aigmüller, Thomas; Hofstätter, Birgit; Marth, Christian",Int J Gynecol Cancer,572,2

METHODS: During the 2017-2018 influenza season, patients with confirmed influenza or RSV infections were enrolled. Room air samples were collected close to (0.30 m) and far (2.20 m) from the patient's head. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect and quantify viral particles in the air samples. Plaque assay was used to determine the infectiousness of the detected viruses. FINDINGS: Fifty-one air samples were collected from the rooms of 29 patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza; 51% of the samples tested positive for influenza A virus (IAV). Among IAV-positive patients, 65% were emitters (have at least one positive air sample) reflecting a higher risk of nosocomial transmission compared to non-emitters. The majority (61.5%) of the IAV-positive air samples were collected at 0.3 m distance from the patients' head, while the remaining were collected at 2.2 m. The positivity rate of IAV in air samplers was influenced by the distance from the patient's head and the day of collection post-hospital admission. Only three patients with RSV infection were recruited and none were emitters. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that influenza can be aerosolized beyond one meter in patient rooms, a distance considered to be safe by infection control practices. Further investigations are needed to determine the extent of infectivity of the aerosolized virus particles.","Chamseddine, A; Soudani, N; Kanafani, Z; Alameddine, I; Dbaibo, G; Zaraket, H; El-Fadel, M",J. hosp. infect,572,1

Thus, in a very short time, teletherapy became the most important tool for healthcare providers who had never used it before, or had used it only sparingly. Parallel to the first lockdown, beginning on April 01, 2020, the existing limit on telemedicine treatment in medical and psychotherapeutic care-20 % of the total number of treatments at a practice-was lifted. Also, in the area of remedy providers, permission was given in phases for the execution of video therapies. The studies on this topic indicate that logopedic teletherapy is clearly effective, as shown in the example of speech therapy for neurologically-related speech disorders in German-speaking countries in the article, even if further studies are needed.

There is also a long-standing and concurrent rise in the prevalence and severity of substance use disorders (SUD). Therefore, the intersection between these two conditions needs to be carefully considered to ensure a more effective delivery of healthcare. RECENT FINDINGS: Generally, those with SUDs are more likely to have higher risk social determinants of health factors. Therefore, these patients are more likely to have barriers that can create difficulties in following appropriate infection control measures which in turn increases the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV2. In addition, these individuals have higher rates of medical comorbidities which increases the risk of all adverse outcomes, including mortality, from SARS-CoV2 infection. SUMMARY: Individuals with SUDs are at increased risk of both contracting SARS-CoV2 infection and suffering from worse outcomes afterwards. Though these risks of adverse outcomes are specific of SARS-CoV2 infection, the risk of exposure to other infectious diseases is increased in this population too. Healthcare providers and policymakers should then consider how to better protect this at-risk population and alleviate this increased disease burden.","Balaram, Kripa; Marwaha, Raman; Kaelber, David C",Curr Opin Psychiatry,572,1

We evaluated the Panbio&#8482; COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device for diagnosis of coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) in symptomatic patients (n = 412) attending primary healthcare centres. METHODS: RAD was performed immediately after sampling following the manufacturer's instructions (reading at 15 min). RT-PCRs were carried out within 24 h of specimen collection. Samples displaying discordant results were processed for culture in Vero E6 cells. Presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in cell cultures was confirmed by RT-PCR. RESULTS: Out of 412 patients, 43 (10.4%) tested positive by RT-PCR and RAD, and 358 (86.9%) tested negative by both methods; discordant results (RT-PCR+/RAD-) were obtained in 11 patients (2.7%). Overall specificity and sensitivity of rapid antigen detection (RAD) was 100% (95%CI 98.7-100%) and 79.6% (95%CI 67.0-88.8%), respectively, taking RT-PCR as the reference. Overall RAD negative predictive value for an estimated prevalence of 5% and 10% was 99% (95%CI 97.4-99.6%) and 97.9% (95%CI 95.9-98.9), respectively. SARS-CoV-2 could not be cultured from specimens yielding RT-PCR+/RAD- results (n = 11). CONCLUSION: The Panbio&#8482; COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device performed well as a POC test for early diagnosis of COVID-19 in primary healthcare centres. More crucially, the data suggested that patients with RT-PCR-proven COVID-19 testing negative by RAD are unlikely to be infectious.","Albert, Eliseo; Torres, Ignacio; Bueno, Felipe; Huntley, Dixie; Molla, Estefanía; Fernández-Fuentes, Miguel Ángel; Martínez, Mireia; Poujois, Sandrine; Forqué, Lorena; Valdivia, Arantxa; Solano de la Asunción, Carlos; Ferrer, Josep; Colomina, Javier; Navarro, David",Clin. microbiol. infect,572,16

In parallel, the in silico reconstruction and modelling of metabolic systems is now acknowledged as a key tool to complement experimental data on a large scale. The integration of these model- and data-driven information is therefore emerging as a new challenge in systems biology, with no clear guidance on how to better take advantage of the inherent multi-source and multi-omic nature of these data types while preserving mechanistic interpretation. RESULTS: Here we investigate different regularisation techniques for high-dimensional data derived from the integration of gene expression profiles with metabolic flux data, extracted from strain-specific metabolic models, to improve cellular growth rate predictions. To this end, we propose ad-hoc extensions of previous regularisation frameworks including group, view-specific and principal component regularisation, and experimentally compare them using data from 1,143 Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. We observe a divergence between methods in terms of regression accuracy and integration effectiveness based on the type of regularisation employed. In multi-omic regression tasks, when learning from experimental and model-generated omic data, our results demonstrate the competitiveness and ease of interpretation of multimodal regularised linear models compared to data-hungry methods based on neural networks.

Here we show that AGGF1 acts as a tumor suppressor by regulating p53 when acting inside tumor cells. AGGF1 antagonizes MDM2 function to inhibit p53 ubiquitination, increases the acetylation, phosphorylation, stability and expression levels of p53, activates transcription of p53 target genes, and regulates cell proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis. AGGF1 also interacts with p53 through the FHA domain. Somatic AGGF1 variants in the FHA domain in human tumors, including p.Q467H, p.Y469â¯N, and p.N483T, inhibit AGGF1 activity on tumor suppression. These results identify a key role for AGGF1 in an AGGF1-MDM2-p53 signaling axis with important functions in tumor suppression, and uncover a novel trans-tumor-suppression mechanism dependent on p53.

METHODS AND RESULTS: This study analysed data contained in the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database for 16 765 patients with a first diagnosis of solitary AFL during 2001-2013. Eligible patients were divided into two groups according to whether or not they had received ablation. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to mitigate the effects of potential confounding factors. The primary outcome was occurrence of IS during follow-up. After 1:2 PSM, the analysis included 1037 patients in the ablation group and 2074 patients in the non-ablation group. The incidence of IS was lower in the ablation group compared to the non-ablation group [subdistribution hazard ratio (SHR) 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41-0.90] during the 2-year follow-up period but not thereafter (SHR 1.03, 95% CI 0.72-1.48). When grouping by stroke history, it revealed that ablation affected the incidence of stroke in patients without history of stroke (SHR 0.59, 95% CI 0.38-0.91) but not in patients with history of stroke. When each group was stratified by CHA2DS2-VASc score, ablation lowered the incidence of stroke in patients with CHA2DS2-VASc &#8804;3 (SHR 0.31, 95% CI 0.16-0.60) but not in patients with CHA2DS2-VASc &#8805;4 in the initial 2-year follow-up. CONCLUSION: The different incidence of IS in patients with/without ablation indicates that ablation reduces the risk of IS in AFL patients.","Lin, Yu-Sheng; Wu, Victor Chien-Chia; Wang, Hui-Ting; Chen, Huang-Chung; Chen, Mien-Cheng; Chang, Shih-Tai; Chu, Pao-Hsien; Chen, Yung-Lung",Europace,572,1

In this context, the anti-COVID-19 utility of Opuntia ficus-indica as source of potential antiviral drugs was investigated in this work on the basis of the activity of some of its phytochemical constituents. The antiviral potential was evaluated in silico in docking experiments with Mpro, i.e., the main protease of SARS-CoV-2, that is one of the most investigated protein targets of therapeutic strategies for COVID-19. By using two web-based molecular docking programs (1-Click Mcule and COVID-19 Docking Server), we found, for several flavonols and flavonol glucosides isolated from Opuntia ficus-indica, good binding affinities for Mpro, and in particular, binding energies lower than −7.0 kcal/mol were predicted for astragalin, isorhamnetin, isorhamnetin 3-O-glucoside, 3-O-caffeoyl quinic acid, and quercetin 5,4′-dimethyl ether. Among these compounds, the chiral compound astragalin showed in our in silico studies the highest affinity for Mpro (−8.7 kcal/mol) and also a low toxicity profile, emerging, thus, as an interesting protease inhibitor candidate for anti-COVID-19 strategies.","Vicidomini, Caterina Roviello Valentina Roviello Giovanni N.",Symmetry,572,23

College student alcohol use is highly prevalent and primarily occurs in social settings where risk for COVID-19 transmission is heightened. This study explored the associations between alcohol use frequency, quantity, motives, and context with: (i) quarantine due to COVID-19 exposure and (ii) a positive diagnosis for COVID-19. A sample of n = 409 college student drinkers completed an online survey about their health and behaviors during the Fall 2020 semester. Since the start of the semester, 36% of students quarantined and 13% of students received a COVID-19 diagnosis. More frequent alcohol use was associated with increased odds of both quarantine and COVID-19 diagnosis. More frequent drinking for social motives was associated with increased likelihood of quarantine, and more frequent drinking for conformity motives was associated with increased likelihood of COVID-19 diagnosis. Participants who often drank alone or with a small group of friends were about half as likely to have quarantined, while those who often drank with a large group of friends were almost twice as likely to have quarantined. Participants who often drank in a bar or nightclub had almost three times the odds of a COVID-19 diagnosis. Frequent alcohol use and drinking for social and conformity motives and in certain contexts are linked to increased likelihood of COVID-19 exposure and diagnosis. Alcohol use prevention efforts, coupled with messaging to discourage large social gatherings in public places, might help to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 among college students.","Allen, Hannah K; Cohen-Winans, Samantha; Armstrong, Kaitlyn; Clark, Nash C; Ford, M Allison",Transl Behav Med,572,16

Thus, it is important to identify risk factors to reduce the mortality rate. This study aimed to assess the factors associated with hospital mortality of COVID-19 patients, and develop a prediction score based on these findings. Methods: We analyzed 111 patients, who were diagnosed with COVID-19 based on reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The following patient characteristics were obtained from records: age, gender, type of symptoms, onset of symptoms, neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR), absolute lymphocyte count, chest x-ray abnormalities, lung involvement, type of lesion, radiographic assessment of the quantity of lung edema (RALE) score, and mortality. Data were analyzed using SPSS 25.0. Results Multivariate analysis showed that age >50 years ( p=0.043), NLR score >5.8 ( p=0.016) and RALE score >2 ( p=0.002) can predict the mortality of COVID-19 patients in the hospital. ROC curve analysis of the score ability to predict mortality showed an area under the curve of 0.794. The cut-off point is 4.5, with a sensitivity of 96.7% and specificity of 49.4% to predict the mortality of COVID-19 patient in the hospital. Conclusions Age, NLR score and RALE score were associated with mortality of COVID-19 patients in the hospital and could be used as a predictor for discharge probability of COVID-19 patients in low health care resource setting. The prediction score may be useful for frontline physicians to effectively manage patients with a higher score to prevent mortality.","Sensusiati, Anggraini Dwi; Amin, Muhammad; Nasronudin, Nasronudin; Rosyid, Alfian Nur; Ramadhan, Nanda Aulya; Lathifah, Rofida; Puspitasari, Eva; Wahyuningtyas, Ria Indah; Soebakti, Erika",F1000Res,572,13

New referrals including patients with suspicion of cancer were not candidates for telemedicine. In total, 548 patients had their appointment altered during the period from 13 March to 30 April 2020. Postal questionnaires were sent to 548 patients and 300 (54.7%) replied. RESULTS: In total, 280 patient answered, 224 (80%) men and 56 (20%) women, mean age 69 years (range 18-91) of whom 180 (64.3%) had a benign and 100 (35.7%) a malignant diagnosis. Twenty (6.7%) respondents did not remember their telephone consultation and were therefore excluded. Telephone consultation satisfaction was reported by 230 (85.0%) patients, but they would not prefer video consultations over telephone consultations, and only 102 (36.4%) would prefer telephone consultations in the future. Patients' age, sex and distance to the hospital did not seem to be associated with telephone consultation satisfaction (age p = 0.17; sex p = 0.99; distance p = 0.27, respectively). In total, 226 (80.7%) were medically assessed as being at risk for COVID, but 74 (26.4%) subjectively evaluated themselves as being at risk. CONCLUSIONS: In general (85.0%), urological patients were satisfied with telephone consultations.","Heeno, Emma; Biesenbach, Irmelin; Englund, Charlotte; Lund, Martin; Toft, Anja; Lund, Lars",Scand J Urol,572,27

Heterogeneous effects among households are observed. Fifty-one percent of the sample households experienced income loss from various livelihood activities, and landless households were more severely affected by the crisis, mainly because of lost farm and nonfarm employment and negative impacts on rural enterprises. Women and men in these landless households were equally engaged and affected by lower wages or more difficulties in finding farm work;fewer women were engaged in nonfarm work, but almost all of them lost such nonfarm wage employment. Women in landless households are also particularly vulnerable in terms of worsened workload and increased tension in the household during COVID-19. Landed households were also affected through lower prices, lower demand for crops, and difficulties in input access. Women and men differ in levels of stress, fear, and pessimism regarding the effects of COVID-19. In most households, there were no signs that household task-sharing and work balance improved, and no clear shift in intrahousehold relations was observed. © 2021 The Authors.

A secondary purpose is to examine the relationship between public and scientific interests in potential therapies for COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic search of clinicaltrials.gov was undertaken on April 22, 2020, to identify all currently registered clinical trials investigating potential therapies for patients with COVID-19. Public interest in the various therapies was quantified utilizing Google Trends. Public interest in hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine was plotted against the cumulative number of active clinical trials evaluating antimalarials as potential COVID-19 therapies over time. RESULTS: There were 341 interventional studies and 208 different therapies actively registered on clinicaltrials.gov whose primary aim is the treatment of COVID-19. The median sample size was 120 patients (range 4-6000) with 154 (45%) trials reporting a planned sample size of 100 patients or less. There was a strong positive correlation (r = 0.76, p = 0.01) between the number of registered clinical trials and the public interest in the top ten proposed therapies. Following the spike in public interest, the average number of new trials increased tenfold with respect to antimalarial therapies. CONCLUSIONS: The relatively small sample sizes and the number of independent trials investigating similar therapies are concerning. Resources may not be being allocated based on scientific merit and may be driven by public consciousness and speculation. Moving forward, a concerted effort focused on implementing large, well-coordinated and carefully designed multi-armed clinical trials will help to ensure that the most promising therapeutic options are rigorously studied and clinically meaningful results produced.","Gazendam, Aaron; Nucci, Nicholas; Ekhtiari, Seper; Gohal, Chetan; Zhu, Meng; Payne, Abbey; Bhandari, Mohit",Int Orthop,572,33

The spine surgery department in The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University in Hefei, China, was used as an example in this study. The spine surgery department took measures to manage the patients, medical staff and wards to avoid the cross-infection within hospital. During the outbreak, no patients or healthcare workers were infected, and no treatment was delayed due to these measures.

However, with limited understanding of the effects of COVID-19 during pregnancy, clinicians and patients are forced to make uninformed decisions. OBJECTIVES: To systematically evaluate the literature and report the maternal and neonatal outcomes associated with COVID-19. SEARCH STRATEGY: PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE were searched from November 1st, 2019 and March 28th, 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: Primary studies, reported in English, investigating COVID-19-positive pregnant women and reporting their pregnancy and neonatal outcomes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data in relation to clinical presentation, investigation were maternal and neonatal outcomes were extracted and analysed using summary statistics. Hypothesis testing was performed to examine differences in time-to-delivery. Study quality was assessed using the ICROMS tool. MAIN RESULTS: Of 73 identified articles, nine were eligible for inclusion (n = 92). 67.4% (62/92) of women were symptomatic at presentation. RT-PCR was inferior to CT-based diagnosis in 31.7% (26/79) of cases. Maternal mortality rate was 0% and only one patient required intensive care and ventilation. 63.8% (30/47) had preterm births, 61.1% (11/18) fetal distress and 80% (40/50) a Caesarean section. 76.92% (11/13) of neonates required NICU admission and 42.8% (40/50) had a low birth weight. There was one indeterminate case of potential vertical transmission. Mean time-to-delivery was 4.3±3.08 days (n = 12) with no difference in outcomes (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19-positive pregnant women present with fewer symptoms than the general population and may be RT-PCR negative despite having signs of viral pneumonia.

In this study, efforts were made to check the infectivity of a local SARS-CoV-2 isolate in a self-limiting and non-lethal hamster model and evaluate the differential expression of lung proteins during acute infection and convalescence. The findings of this study confirm the infectivity of this isolate in vivo. Analysis of clinical parameters and tissue samples show the pathophysiological manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection similar to that reported earlier in COVID-19 patients and hamsters infected with other isolates. However, diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), a common histopathological feature of human COVID-19 was only occasionally noticed. The lung-associated pathological changes were very prominent on the 4th day post-infection (dpi), mostly resolved by 14 dpi. Here, we carried out the quantitative proteomic analysis of the lung tissues from SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters on day 4 and day 14 post-infection. This resulted in the identification of 1585 proteins of which 68 proteins were significantly altered between both the infected groups. Pathway analysis revealed complement and coagulation cascade, platelet activation, ferroptosis, and focal adhesion as the top enriched pathways. In addition, we also identified altered expression of two pulmonary surfactant-associated proteins (Sftpd and Sftpb), known for their protective role in lung function. Together, these findings will aid in understanding the mechanism(s) involved in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and progression of the disease.","Suresh, Voddu; Mohanty, Varshasnata; Avula, Kiran; Ghosh, Arup; Singh, Bharati; Reddy, Rajendra Kumar; Parida, Deepti; Suryawanshi, Amol Ratnakar; Raghav, Sunil Kumar; Chattopadhyay, Soma; Prasad, Punit; Swain, Rajeeb Kumar; Dash, Rupesh; Parida, Ajay; Syed, Gulam Hussain; Senapati, Shantibhusan",FASEB J,572,33

Risk factors for mortality in critically ill patients, especially detailed self-evaluation indicators and laboratory-examination indicators, have not been well described. In this paper, a total of 192 critically ill patients (142 were discharged and 50 died in the hospital) with COVID-19 were included. Self-evaluation indicators including demographics, baseline characteristics, and symptoms and detailed lab-examination indicators were extracted. Data were first compared between survivors and nonsurvivors. Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) was performed to identify possible risk factors for mortality of COVID-19 patients. MVPA achieved a relatively high classification accuracy of 93% when using both self-evaluation indicators and laboratory-examination indicators. Several self-evaluation factors related to COVID-19 were highly associated with mortality, including age, duration (time from illness onset to admission), and the Barthel index (BI) score. When the duration, age increased by 1 day, 1 year, BI decreased by 1 point, the mortality increased by 3.6%, 2.4%, and 0.9% respectively. Laboratory-examination indicators including C-reactive protein, white blood cell count, platelet count, fibrin degradation products, oxygenation index, lymphocyte count, and d-dimer were also risk factors. Among them, duration was the strongest predictor of all-cause mortality. Several self-evaluation indicators that can simply be obtained by questionnaires and without clinical examination were the risk factors of all-cause mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients. The prediction model can be used by individuals to improve health awareness, and by clinicians to identify high-risk individuals.","Chen, Yinyin; Linli, Zeqiang; Lei, Yuting; Yang, Yiya; Liu, Zhipeng; Xia, Youchun; Liang, Yumei; Zhu, Huabo; Guo, Shuixia",J Med Virol,572,22

MAIN BODY: This article critically examines the evidence guiding current target oxygen saturation recommendation for COVID-19 patients, and raises important concerns in the extrapolation of data from the two studies stated to be guiding the recommendation. Next, it examines the influence of hypoxia on upregulation of ACE2 (target receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry) expression, with supporting transcriptomic analysis of a publicly available gene expression profile dataset of human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells cultured in normoxic or hypoxic conditions. Finally, it discusses potential implications of specific clinical observations and considerations in COVID-19 patients on target oxygen saturation, such as diffuse systemic endothelitis and microthrombi playing an important pathogenic role in the wide range of systemic manifestations, exacerbation of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in the setting of pulmonary vascular endothelitis/microthrombi, the phenomenon of ""silent hypoxemia"" with some patients presenting to the hospital with severe hypoxemia disproportional to symptoms, and overburdened health systems and public health resources in many parts of the world with adverse implications on outpatient monitoring and early institution of oxygen supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: The above factors and analyses, put together, call for an urgent exploration and re-evaluation of target oxygen saturation in COVID-19 patients, both in the inpatient and outpatient settings. Until data from such trials become available, where possible, it may be prudent to target an oxygen saturation at least at the upper end of the recommended 92-96% range in COVID-19 patients both in the inpatient and outpatient settings (in patients that are normoxemic at pre-COVID baseline). Home pulse oximetry, tele-monitoring, and earlier institution of oxygen supplementation for hypoxemic COVID-19 outpatients could be beneficial, where public health resources allow for their implementation.","Shenoy, Niraj; Luchtel, Rebecca; Gulani, Perminder",BMC Med,572,13

The significant part of CoV-19 from the global point is transmission rate, and therefore, it is mandatory to identify and isolate the affected persons even with the mild infection. To stop the rapid transmission of virus to drastic manner, it is essential to follow the hygienic practices, identification of potential vaccines and proper health care management systems to combat the novel virus. Despite the serious mortality rates and high confirmed cases, at present, there is no proven treatment and vaccine to treat the pandemic coronavirus. The current review prioritizes the recent trends in the health care sector, vaccine development pipeline and artificial intelligence role to combat CoV-2. Due to the unprecedented situation, the health care professionals was under high working stress and they were pushed to make serious decisions on time. Several health care workers pose directly threat to the occupational health risk. Besides, the industry is also experiencing a decrease in the outpatient footfalls along with the reduction of international patients.

Methods: A prospective cohort study was performed including children infected by SARS-CoV-2 between March and May 2020. Patients were categorized into 3 groups: children admitted with COVID-19;outpatient children with mild COVID-19;and seropositive children participating in a seroprevalence study among cohabitants of infected healthcare workers (HCWs). Six months after the infection, a new serological control was performed. Results: A total of 58 children were included, 50% male (median age 8.3 [IQR 2.8–13.5] years). The median time between the two serological studies was 186 (IQR 176–192) days, and 86% (48/56) of the children maintained positive IgG six months after the infection. This percentage was 100% in admitted patients and 78% among the rest of the included children (p = 0.022). The diagnoses of lower respiratory tract infection and multisystemic inflammatory syndrome were associated with persistence of IgG (p = 0.035). The children of HCWs in the seroprevalence study lost antibodies more often (p = 0.017).

This system works like a global auction where advertisers bid to display their impressions in the publishers' ad slots. The most popular system to select which advertiser wins each auction is the Generalized second-price auction in which the advertiser that offers the most wins the bet and is charged with the price of the second largest bet. In this paper, we propose an alternative betting system with a new approach that not only considers the economic aspect but also other relevant factors for the functioning of the advertising system. The factors that we consider are, among others, the benefit that can be given to each advertiser, the probability of conversion from the advertisement, the probability that the visit is fraudulent, how balanced are the networks participating in RTB and if the advertisers are not paying over the market price. In addition, we propose a methodology based on genetic algorithms to optimize the selection of each advertiser. We also conducted some experiments to compare the performance of the proposed model with the famous Generalized Second-Price method.

There is a growing concern about biomedical waste (BMW) management among health care workers, however there are limited reports on BMW management by dental personnel in developing countries. Objectives: This study investigated the level of knowledge of BMW, observance of proper mercury hygiene and BMW management practice among public dental personnel in Lagos State, Nigeria. Methods: A cross-sectional study regarding BMW management across public hospitals in Lagos State, Nigeria was conducted following institutional ethics committee approval. A self-administered questionnaire was utilized to obtain data from different facilities selected by purposive and simple random sampling techniques as applicable. The questionnaires were distributed among 437 respondents by convenience sampling. The resulting data were statistically tested using Chi-square and G-test with p-value < 0.05 indicating significant level. Results: Amongst 437 respondents, majority were females (62.5%) and the highest proportion fell within the age range of 25-34 years (44.4%). Only 17.2% of the respondents had good knowledge of BMW management/legislation and 4.1% had good BMW practice. Less than half (49.4%) of respondents disposed mercury-contaminated materials inside the trash and majority (92.2%) did not observe proper mercury hygiene. Significantly better mercury hygiene practices were observed in secondary facilities (p=0.040). Conclusion: A minor proportion of public dental personnel had good knowledge and practice of proper mercury hygiene and BMW management. This shows there is an urgent need for training of health personnel on proper BMW handling and disposal in developing countries like Nigeria.","Makanjuola, John Oluwatosin; Ekowmenhenhen, Uyi Idah; Enone, Lillian Lami; Umesi, Donna Chioma; Ogundana, Oladunni Mojirayo; Arotiba, Godwin Toyin",Afr Health Sci,572,33

Phytotherapy has an established role in everyday self-care and health care, but, since botanical preparations contain many chemical constituents rather than single compounds, challenges arise in demonstrating efficacy and safety. However, there is ample traditional, empirical, and clinical evidence that botanicals can offer some protection and alleviation of disease symptoms as well as promoting general well-being. Newly emerging viral infections, specifically COVID-19, represent a unique challenge in their novelty and absence of established antiviral treatment or immunization. We discuss here the roles and limitations of phytotherapy in helping to prevent and address viral infections, especially regarding their effects on immune response. Botanicals with a documented immunomodulatory, immunostimulatory, and antiinflammatory effects include adaptogens, Boswellia spp., Curcuma longa, Echinacea spp., Glycyrrhiza spp., medicinal fungi, Pelargonium sidoides, salicylate-yielding herbs, and Sambucus spp. We further provide a clinical perspective on applications and safety of these herbs in prevention, onset, progression, and convalescence from respiratory viral infections.","Brendler, Thomas; Al-Harrasi, Ahmed; Bauer, Rudolf; Gafner, Stefan; Hardy, Mary L; Heinrich, Michael; Hosseinzadeh, Hossein; Izzo, Angelo A; Michaelis, Martin; Nassiri-Asl, Marjan; Panossian, Alexander; Wasser, Solomon P; Williamson, Elizabeth M",Phytother. res,572,2

Here, we examined 217 recovered COVID-19 patients to assess their viral RNA shedding and residual antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. We also evaluated antibodies in blood samples from 308 close contacts of recovered COVID-19 patients. We found that viral RNA remained detectable in 6.6% of recovered COVID-19 cases and up to 105 days.

Understanding the mediators between personality and stress is critical for developing effective stress management interventions during a pandemic. Our study explored whether perceptions of threat from COVID-19 and efficacy to follow government recommendations for preventing COVID-19 would mediate the relationships between personality traits (e.g., neuroticism, conscientiousness-goal-striving, extroversion-activity and sociability) and perceived stress. In an online survey of a representative sample of Canadian adults (n = 1055), we found that higher neuroticism and extroversion were associated with higher levels of stress during the pandemic and a greater increase in stress levels compared to levels before the pandemic. Perceived threat and efficacy significantly mediated the relationship between neuroticism and stress, which suggested that individuals with higher neuroticism experienced higher levels of stress due to higher levels of perceived threat and lower levels of efficacy. Perceived threat did not mediate the relationship between extroverts and stress, which suggested that the source of stress may stem from elsewhere (e.g., inability to socialize). Our findings highlighted that personality traits could be an important factor in identifying stress-prone individuals during a pandemic and that stress management interventions need to be personality specific.","Liu, Sam; Lithopoulos, Alexander; Zhang, Chun-Qing; Garcia-Barrera, Mauricio A.; Rhodes, Ryan E.",Pers.

Growth curve modelling showed major changes in employees' work-related well-being reflected in decreasing work engagement and increasing job satisfaction. For work-non-work balance, workload and autonomy, cubic trends over time were found, reflecting initial declines during crisis onset (March/April) and recovery in May. Participants' additional remarks exemplify that employees struggled with fulfilling different roles simultaneously, developing new routines and managing boundaries between life domains.

Such problems arise in decision making under uncertainty, such as in portfolio optimization and robust systems design. We propose a family of novel Bayesian optimization algorithms that exploit the structure of the objective function to substantially improve sampling efficiency. Instead of modeling the objective function directly as is typical in Bayesian optimization, these algorithms model $F$ as a Gaussian process, and use the implied posterior on the objective function to decide which points to evaluate.

Despite appreciable research, identification of targeted populations for testing and tracking the spread of COVID-19 at a larger scale is an intimidating challenge. There is a need to quickly identify the infected individual or community to check the spread. The diagnostic testing done at large-scale for individuals has limitations as it cannot provide information at a swift pace in large populations, which is pivotal to contain the spread at the early stage of its breakouts. Recently, scientists are exploring the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the faeces discharged in municipal wastewater. Wastewater sampling could be a potential tool to expedite the early identification of infected communities by detecting the biomarkers from the virus. However, it needs a targeted approach to choose optimized locations for wastewater sampling. The present study proposes a novel fuzzy based Bayesian model to identify targeted populations and optimized locations with a maximum probability of detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater networks. Consequently, real time monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater using autosamplers or biosensors could be deployed efficiently. Fourteen criteria such as population density, patients with comorbidity, quarantine and hospital facilities, etc. are analysed using the data of 14 lac individuals infected by COVID-19 in the USA. The uniqueness of the proposed model is its ability to deal with the uncertainty associated with the data and decision maker's opinions using fuzzy logic, which is fused with Bayesian approach. The evidence-based virus detection in wastewater not only facilitates focused testing, but also provides potential communities for vaccine distribution. Consequently, governments can reduce lockdown periods, thereby relieving human stress and boosting economic growth.","Rallapalli, Srinivas; Aggarwal, Shubham; Singh, Ajit Pratap",Sci Total Environ,572,20

We identified IBS subtype-specific and symptom-related variation in microbial composition and function. A subset of identified changes in microbial metabolites correspond to host physiological mechanisms that are relevant to IBS. By integrating multiple data layers, we identified purine metabolism as a novel host-microbial metabolic pathway in IBS with translational potential.

The extraordinary interhuman transmission of this disease has urged scientists to examine the various facets of its pathogenic agent, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Herein, based on publicly available genomic data, we analyzed the codon usage co-adaptation profiles of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory coronaviruses (CoVs) with their human host, identified CoV-responsive human genes and their functional roles on the basis of both the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU)-based correlation of viral genes with human genes and differential gene expression analysis, and predicted potential drugs for COVID-19 treatment based on these genes. The relatively high codon adaptation index (CAI) values (>0.70) signposted the gene expressivity efficiency of CoVs in human. The ENc-GC3 plot indicated that SARS-CoV-2 genome was under strict selection pressure while SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were under selection and mutational pressures. The RSCU-based correlation analysis indicated that the viral genomes shared similar codons with a panoply of human genes. The merging of RSCU-based correlation data and SARS-CoV-2-responsive differentially expressed genes allowed the identification of human genes potentially affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that these genes were enriched in biological processes and pathways related to host response to viral infection and immune response. Using the drug-gene interaction database, we screened a list of drugs that could target these genes as potential COVID-19 therapeutics. Our findings not only will contribute in vaccine development but also provide a useful set of drugs that could guide practitioners in strategical monitoring of COVID-19. We recommend practitioners to scrupulously screen this list of predicted drugs in order to authenticate those qualified for treating COVID-19 symptoms.","Nambou, Komi; Anakpa, Manawa",Infect Genet Evol,572,16

But there are compelling reasons to question the assertion that we are running out. On the one hand, new technologies and discoveries have increased the supply of petroleum and natural gas. On the other, concerns about global climate change and the competitiveness of renewable energy are turning coal into a sunset industry and threaten to transform oil reserves into stranded assets. In contrast to fossil fuels, which are consumed in the process of generating energy, virtually all of the metals excavated in the past remain available even after they have been put to use. Even though the average size and degree of mineralization of recently-discovered ore bodies is on the decline, there has never been as much copper, silver, and gold available for human consumption as there is today. Whether incorporated into digital technology or infrastructure, the majority of metals remain available for recycling, which is generally less expensive, uses less energy, and has fewer environmental impacts than extracting minerals from the earth.

A hypothesis,16.253576,6.461825,2020,"BACKGROUND: Current research has pointed out an increased risk of mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic in women compared to men, however the reason for this difference remains unclear. The aim of this research is to study early psychological responses to the pandemic in the Spanish general population, focusing on gender differences. METHODS: Nine to 14 days after the declaration of a state of emergency an online survey was conducted assessing sociodemographic, health, behavioral and COVID-19-related variables. Mental health status was evaluated by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and the Self-Care Scale (SCS). RESULTS: The study included 3520 respondents: 2611 women and 909 men. Women scored significantly higher in DASS-21 and IES-R (p < 0.05) and were more likely to somatize, suffer from hypochondriasis, sleeping disturbances and claustrophobia (p < 0.05). Being a woman can be considered a risk factor for intrusive thoughts, avoidance mechanisms, stress and anxiety (Odd Ratio = 2.7/2.3/2.3/1.6). The risk of presenting posttraumatic symptoms and emotional distress was greater in women (Odd Ratio = 6.77/4.59). General linear models to predict IES-R and DASS-21 scores clarified which variables were gender specific, such as main concerns. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that at early stages of the pandemic, women mental health was more impacted and that both genders show different concerns. Gender perspective in secondary and tertiary prevention strategies must be taken into account when facing the distress associated with the pandemic.","Del Río-Casanova, Lucía; Sánchez-Martín, Milagrosa; García-Dantas, Ana; González-Vázquez, Anabel; Justo, Ania",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),572,16

Additionally, by interrogating the temporal effects of radiotherapy on human peripheral blood mononuclear and mucosal cells, we observed important treatment-related alterations in host innate immunity, specifically type I interferon responses.

Our goal is to minimize the number of fatalities over the course of two years without inducing excessive social costs. We consider a tailored model of the German COVID-19 outbreak with different parameter sets to design and validate our approach. Our analysis reveals that an open-loop optimal control policy can significantly decrease the number of fatalities when compared to simpler policies under the assumption of exact model knowledge. In a more realistic scenario with uncertain data and model mismatch, a feedback strategy that updates the policy weekly using model predictive control (MPC) leads to a reliable performance, even when applied to a validation model with deviant parameters. On top of that, we propose a robust MPC-based feedback policy using interval arithmetic that adapts the social distancing measures cautiously and safely, thus leading to a minimum number of fatalities even if measurements are inaccurate and the infection rates cannot be precisely specified by social distancing. Our theoretical findings support various recent studies by showing that 1) adaptive feedback strategies are required to reliably contain the COVID-19 outbreak, 2) well-designed policies can significantly reduce the number of fatalities compared to simpler ones while keeping the amount of social distancing measures on the same level, and 3) imposing stronger social distancing measures early on is more effective and cheaper in the long run than opening up too soon and restoring stricter measures at a later time.","Kohler, J.; Schwenkel, L.; Koch, A.; Berberich, J.; Pauli, P.; Allgower, F.",,572,32

Specifically, it can be used for syndromic surveillance, a method used to analyze instantaneous health data for early detection of disease outbreaks. Objective: To analyze how the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes input by medical students at the Edward Via College of Osteopathic Medicine into the Clinical Rotation Evaluation and Documentation Organizer (CREDO) patient encounter logging system could act as a new syndromic surveillance tool. Methods: A CREDO database query was conducted for ICD-10 codes entered between November 1, 2019 and March 13, 2020 using the World Health Organization's 2011 revised case definitions for Influenza Like Illness (ILI). During that period, medical students had an approximated mean of 3,000 patient encounters per day from over 1,500 clinical sites. A cumulative sum technique was applied to the data to generate alert thresholds. Breast cancer, a disease with a stable incidence during the specified timeframe, was used as a control. Results: Total ILI daily ICD-10 counts that exceeded alert thresholds represented unusual levels of disease occurred 11 times from November 20, 2020 through February 28, 2020. This analysis is consistent with the COVID-19 pandemic timeline. The first statistically significant ILI increase occurred nine days prior to the first laboratory confirmed case in the country. Conclusion: Syndromic surveillance can be timelier than traditional surveillance methods, which require laboratory testing to confirm disease. As a result of this study, we are installing a real-time alert for ILI into CREDO, so rates can be monitored continuously as an indicator of possible future new infectious disease outbreaks.","Bruzda, Gabrielle; Rawlins, Fred; Sumpter, Cameron; Garner, Harold R",J Osteopath Med,572,1

We use an SEIR-model for each region in Sweden in which the infectivity is assumed to depend on mobility data in terms of public transport utilisation and mobile phone usage. The results show that the model can capture the timing of the first and beginning of the second wave of the pandemic. Further, we show that for two major regions of Sweden models with public transport data outperform models using mobile phone usage.

Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in China using a 37-item questionnaire developed based on previous research. A professional online survey tool (www.wjx.cn) and a social media platform (WeChat) were used to display and distribute the questionnaire. Data were collected during April 11 to 13, 2020, when most regions of China had resumed dental practice except for high-risk regions such as Wuhan. Then the data were analyzed with multivariable generalized estimating equations. Results: A total of 2,669 valid questionnaires were collected. Orthodontic services were suspended for nearly all respondents (97.8%) during the epidemic, and 68.0% had resumed work by the time they completed the questionnaire. The majority of respondents (80.2%) were confident that they understood COVID-19 related knowledge, but most of them only correctly answered less than half of the questions testing their actual level of knowledge. About two-thirds (64.1%) were willing to treat/care for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. The completion of relevant training programs was significantly associated with more confidence in knowledge mastery (P &lt; 0.001) and a higher actual level of knowledge (P &lt; 0.001), but did not increase their willingness to treat/care for patients with COVID-19 (P = 0.235). Conclusions: Before work resumption, COVID-19-related training programs are essential for the improvement of knowledge, confidence, and preparedness of orthodontic professionals. Sufficient and proper protection should also be provided to ensure safety and reduce the psychological burden on them.

We conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the impact of selenium administration on severe sepsis or septic shock. Methods: We search PubMed, EMbase, Web of science, EBSCO, and Cochrane library databases through May 2020 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effect of selenium administration on severe sepsis or septic shock. Meta-analysis is performed using the random-effect model. Results: Five RCTs involving 1482 patients are included in the meta-analysis. Overall, compared with control group in septic patients, selenium administration is not associated with reduced 28-day mortality (RR=0.93; 95% CI=0.73 to 1.19; P=0.58), but results in substantially decreased all-cause mortality (RR=0.78; 95% CI=0.63 to 0.98; P=0.03) and length of hospital stay (MD=-3.09; 95% CI=-5.68 to -0.50; P=0.02).

The aim of this study was to characterize COVID-19-associated morbidity and in-hospital mortality by race/ethnicity. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of nine Massachusetts hospitals including all consecutive adult patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Measured outcomes were assessed and compared by patient-reported race/ethnicity, classified as White, Black, Latinx, Asian, or other. Students t-test, Fischer exact test, and multivariable regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: 379 patients (62.9±16.5 years; 55.7% men) with confirmed COVID-19 were included (49.9% White, 13.7% Black, 29.8% Latinx, 3.7% Asian), of which 376 (99.2%) were insured (34.3% private, 41.2% public, 23.8% public with supplement). Latinx patients were younger, had fewer cardiopulmonary disorders, were more likely to have obesity, more frequently reported fever and myalgia, and had lower D-dimer levels compared to White patients (p&0.05). On multivariable analysis controlling for age, gender, obesity, cardiopulmonary comorbidities, hypertension, and diabetes, no significant differences in in-hospital mortality, ICU admission, or mechanical ventilation by race/ethnicity were found. Diabetes was a significant predictor for mechanical ventilation (OR 1.89; 95% CI 1.11-3.23) while older age was a predictor of in-hospital mortality (OR 4.18; 95% CI 1.94-9.04). CONCLUSIONS: In this multi-center cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the largest health system in Massachusetts, there was no association between race/ethnicity and clinically relevant hospitalization outcomes, including in-hospital mortality, after controlling for key demographic/clinical characteristics. These findings serve to refute suggestions that certain races/ethnicities may be biologically predisposed to poorer COVID-19 outcomes.","McCarty, Thomas R; Hathorn, Kelly E; Redd, Walker D; Rodriguez, Nicolette J; Zhou, Joyce C; Bazarbashi, Ahmad Najdat; Njie, Cheikh; Wong, Danny; Trinh, Quoc-Dien; Shen, Lin; Stone, Valerie E; Chan, Walter W",Clin. infect. dis,572,2

Identifying individuals whose infection can potentially become severe is critical to control the case fatality rate of COVID-19. However, knowledge of symptoms that are prognostic of COVID-19 severity is lacking. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to identify symptoms prognostic of COVID-19 infection severity. METHODS: We analyzed documented symptoms, including fever, cough, fatigue, expectoration, sore throat, chest distress, headache, diarrhea, rhinorrhea, stuffed nose, nausea, vomiting, muscle or joint ache, shortness of breath, and their associations with disease severity using a case series, including 655 confirmed cases from January 23 to February 5, 2020 in Henan Province, China. We also analyzed the influence of individual characteristics, including age, gender, and comorbidities, on symptoms with prognostic value. RESULTS: Fatigue (95% CI 0.141 to 0.334, P<.001), expectoration (95% CI 0.107 to 0.305, P<.001) and stuffed nose (95% CI -0.499 to -0.082, P=.006) were identified as the prognostic symptoms of COVID-19 patients from the multivariate analysis. Fever occurred in 603/655 (92.1%) of the patients but was not associated with disease severity. Fatigue accounted for 184/655 (28.1%) of the patients and was linearly associated with infection severity with statistical significance. Expectoration occurred in 169/655 (25.8%) patients in the cohort and was the sole prognostic factor for patients with cardiovascular complications, including hypertension. Shortness of breath, chest distress, muscle or joint ache, and dry cough, which occurred in 33 (5%), 83 (12.7%), 78 (11.9%), and 276 (42.1%) of the 655 patients, respectively, were significantly enriched among patients classified as severe. Stuffed nose and nausea were associated with favorable disease severity, especially among male patients. More female than male patients were documented as having muscle or joint ache. Headache was most enriched in patents aged 15 to 39 years, followed by those aged 40 to 64 years, with statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Fatigue and expectoration are signs of severe COVID-19 infection. Shortness of breath, chest distress, muscle or joint ache, and dry cough are prevalent in severe patients. Expectoration is commonly present in older individuals and patients with cardiovascular disorders, including hypertension. Shortness of breath is prognostic of severe infection in male patients. Stuffed nose and nausea are favorable prognostic factors of severe infection, especially among male patients.","Li, Jitian; Chen, Zhe; Nie, Yifei; Ma, Yan; Guo, Qiaoyun; Dai, Xiaofeng",J Med Internet Res,572,16

Here, we report an extensive serological study of SARS-CoV-2 infection in dogs in Wuhan and analyze the infection rates at different stages of the pandemic outbreak. A total of 946 dogs serum samples were collected from Wuhan, of which 36 samples were obtained prior to the pandemic outbreak. Indirect enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed that 16 sera collected during the outbreak were detected as positive through the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. Of these 16 sera, 10 exhibited measurable SARS-CoV-2 specific neutralizing antibodies whose titers ranged from 1/20 to 1/180. No serological cross-reactivity was detected between SARS-CoV-2 and canine coronavirus (CCV). Furthermore, with the effective control of the outbreak, a decrease in the SARS-CoV-2 seropositive dog number was observed.

Semi-quantitative assessment methods, e.g., lobar-, segmental-based CT scores and opacity-weighted score, and quantitative assessment method, i.e., lesion volume quantification, were applied to quantify the lung lesions. All four assessment methods had high inter-rater agreements. At the group level, the lesion load in severe type patients was consistently observed to be significantly higher than that in common type in the applications of four assessment methods (all the p < 0.001). In discriminating severe from common patients at the individual level, results for lobe-based, segment-based and opacity-weighted assessments had high true positives while the quantitative lesion volume had high true negatives. In conclusion, both semi-quantitative and quantitative methods have excellent repeatability in measuring inflammatory lesions, and can well distinguish between common type and severe type patients. Lobe-based CT score is fast, readily clinically available, and has a high sensitivity in identifying severe type patients. It is suggested to be a prioritized method for assessing the burden of lung lesions in COVID-19 patients.","Guan, Xiaojun; Yao, Liding; Tan, Yanbin; Shen, Zhujing; Zheng, Hanpeng; Zhou, Haisheng; Gao, Yuantong; Li, Yongchou; Ji, Wenbin; Zhang, Huangqi; Wang, Jun; Zhang, Minming; Xu, Xiaojun",Sci Rep,572,16

About 5% of patients with Covid-19 have severe symptoms including septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and the failure of several organs, while most of them have mild symptoms. Frequently, the kidneys are involved through direct or indirect mechanisms. Kidney involvement mainly manifests itself as proteinuria and acute kidney injury (AKI). The SARS-CoV-2-induced kidney damage is expected to be multifactorial; directly it can infect the kidney podocytes and proximal tubular cells and based on an angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) pathway it can lead to acute tubular necrosis, protein leakage in Bowman's capsule, collapsing glomerulopathy and mitochondrial impairment. The SARS-CoV-2-driven dysregulation of the immune responses including cytokine storm, macrophage activation syndrome, and lymphopenia can be other causes of the AKI. Organ interactions, endothelial dysfunction, hypercoagulability, rhabdomyolysis, and sepsis are other potential mechanisms of AKI. Moreover, lower oxygen delivery to kidney may cause an ischaemic injury. Understanding the fundamental molecular pathways and pathophysiology of kidney injury and AKI in Covid-19 is necessary to develop management strategies and design effective therapies.","Ahmadian, Elham; Hosseiniyan Khatibi, Seyed Mahdi; Razi Soofiyani, Saiedeh; Abediazar, Sima; Shoja, Mohammadali M; Ardalan, Mohammadreza; Zununi Vahed, Sepideh",Rev Med Virol,572,23

Due to the spread of infection by SARS-CoV-2, many professionals have had to adapt their work to telerehabilitation practices, which require the best evidence at short notice and in summarized form. In this context, this protocol has been developed to evaluate the effectiveness of telerehabilitation as a care strategy in physical therapy for different conditions, populations, and contexts. Method and analysis: An overview will be carried out in the format of a rapid review. It will include systematic reviews of different conditions, populations, and contexts, where the intervention to be evaluated is telerehabilitation by physical therapy. The outcomes considered will be clinical effectiveness depending on the specific condition, functionality, quality of life, satisfaction, adherence, and safety. A search will be carried out of the MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases. Studies will be selected in duplicate with any discrepancies resolved by a third reviewer. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment will be carried out by a reviewer with non-independent verification by a second reviewer. The findings will be reported qualitatively by tables and figures. Ethics and dissemination: The principles of the value of the research question, the methodological rigor, scientifically qualified investigators, an independent evaluation of the protocol, and timely and accurate publication of the results will be complied with. The complete review will lead to the publication of at least one article, and the results will be widely disseminated at various levels of decision-making.

Prompt identification, isolation and contact tracing of COVID-19 cases are key elements in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study was to evaluate the rate of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among HCWs exposed to patients with COVID-19 in relation to the main determinants of exposure. To assess the risk of exposure, we performed active symptom monitoring in 1006 HCWs identified as contacts of COVID19 cases. The presence of symptoms was statistically associated with a positive nasopharyngeal swab result. Only one subject was asymptomatic at the time of positive test. These data suggest that clinical history may help in the selection of subjects to be investigated by means of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in the case of a shortage of diagnostic resources. We found that close contact (within 2 m for 15 min or more) was not statistically related to contagion. Regarding the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), only the use of facial masks was inversely related to the chance of becoming infected (p < 0.01). In conclusion, our data show that unprotected contacts between HCWs should be considered a major route of HCW contagion, suggesting that the use of facial masks should be implemented even in settings where known patients with COVID-19 are not present.","Coppeta, Luca; Somma, Giuseppina; Ippoliti, Lorenzo; Ferrari, Cristiana; D039,; Alessandro, Iacopo; Pietroiusti, Antonio; Trabucco Aurilio, Marco",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),572,22

Incomplete understanding of the fundamental biological aspects of osteoarthritis underlies the current lack of effective treatment or disease modifying drugs. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We implemented a systems approach by making use of the statistical network concepts in Weighted Gene Co-expression Analysis to reconstruct the organization of the core proteome network in chondrocytes obtained from OA patients and healthy individuals. Protein modules reflect groups of tightly co-ordinated changes in protein abundance across healthy and OA chondrocytes. RESULTS: The unbiased systems analysis identified extracellular matrix (ECM) mechanosensing and glycolysis as two modules that are most highly correlated with &#927;&#913;. The ECM module was enriched in the OA genetic risk factors tenascin-C (TNC) and collagen 11A1 (COL11A1), as well as in cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), a biomarker associated with cartilage integrity. Mapping proteins that are unique to OA or healthy chondrocytes onto the core interactome, which connects microenvironment sensing and regulation of glycolysis, identified differences in metabolic and anti-inflammatory adaptation. CONCLUSION: The interconnection between cartilage ECM remodeling and metabolism is indicative of the dynamic chondrocyte states and their significance in osteoarthritis.","Destouni, Aspasia; Tsolis, Konstantinos C; Economou, Anastassios; Papathanasiou, Ioanna; Balis, Charalampos; Mourmoura, Evanthia; Tsezou, Aspasia",Expert Rev Proteomics,572,29

Robust analysis of outcomes for CLL patients, particularly examining effects of baseline characteristics and CLL-directed therapy, is critical to optimally manage CLL patients through this evolving pandemic. CLL patients diagnosed with symptomatic COVID-19 across 43 international centers (n = 198) were included. Hospital admission occurred in 90%. Median age at COVID-19 diagnosis was 70.5 years. Median Cumulative Illness Rating Scale score was 8 (range, 4-32). Thirty-nine percent were treatment naive (""watch and wait""), while 61% had received &#8805;1 CLL-directed therapy (median, 2; range, 1-8). Ninety patients (45%) were receiving active CLL therapy at COVID-19 diagnosis, most commonly Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKi's; n = 68/90 [76%]). At a median follow-up of 16 days, the overall case fatality rate was 33%, though 25% remain admitted. Watch-and-wait and treated cohorts had similar rates of admission (89% vs 90%), intensive care unit admission (35% vs 36%), intubation (33% vs 25%), and mortality (37% vs 32%). CLL-directed treatment with BTKi's at COVID-19 diagnosis did not impact survival (case fatality rate, 34% vs 35%), though the BTKi was held during the COVID-19 course for most patients. These data suggest that the subgroup of CLL patients admitted with COVID-19, regardless of disease phase or treatment status, are at high risk of death.

We identified three key reasons for this fall in patient demand. First, COVID-19-related hygiene measures and behavioral changes significantly reduced non-COVID-19 infectious diseases. Second, consultations relating to chronic diseases fell sharply. Third, certain medical investigations and interventions were postponed or cancelled. Despite the drop in hospital attendances and admissions, COVID-19 is said to have brought the Japanese health care system to the brink of collapse. In this context, we explore longstanding systematic issues, finding that Japans abundant supply of beds and current payment system may have introduced a perverse incentive to overprovide services, creating a mismatch between patient needs and the supply of health care resources. Poor coordination among health care providers and the highly decentralized governance of the health care system have also contributed to the crisis. In order to ensure the long-term sustainability of the Japanese health care system beyond COVID-19, it is essential to promote specialization and differentiation of medical functions among hospitals, to strengthen governance, and to introduce appropriate payment reform.

This global pandemic has presented an opportunity to digitalize diabetes care and rapidly implement virtual diabetes clinics, with the aim of optimizing diabetes management and well-being, while keeping patients safe. We performed a rapid review of the literature to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of virtual clinics in diabetes care before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and have combined these findings with our own reflections in practice. We identified examples demonstrating safety and feasibility of virtual diabetes clinics, which aligns with our own clinical experience during the pandemic. The advantages of virtual clinics include reduced treatment burden, improved therapeutic alliances, societal and psychological benefits, and in our experience, innovative solutions to overcome the challenges presented by the transition from in-person to virtual care. We have provided three infographics to illustrate lessons learned and key recommendations, including steps to establish a virtual diabetes clinic, a checklist guide for health care professionals conducting virtual clinics, and a patient guide for making the most out of the virtual clinic.

The initial LUS was 16 (11 - 21), which did not significantly correlate with initial CT scans, probably due to rapid progression of the disease and time between CT scan on admission and first FICT evaluation; conversely, LUS was significantly correlated with PaO2/FiO2 ratio throughout patient follow-up [R = - 4.82 (- 6.84 to - 2.80; p < 0.001)]. The area under the receiving operating characteristics curve of LUS for the diagnosis of moderate-severe disease (PaO2/FiO2 ratio &#8804; 200 mmHg) was 0.73, with an optimal cutoff value of 11 (positive predictive value: 0.98; negative predictive value: 0.29). Patients who eventually needed invasive ventilation and/or died during admission had significantly higher LUS throughout their stay.","Baciarello, Marco; Bonetti, Andrea; Vetrugno, Luigi; Saturno, Francesco; Nouvenne, Antonio; Bellini, Valentina; Meschi, Tiziana; Bignami, Elena",J. clin. monit. comput,572,7

However, conferences carry an ecological footprint due to greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, traditional conference formats have recently not been possible due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Herein we examine the carbon footprint associated with travel by presenting delegates to the Fall SPU conferences from 2013 to 2019, and the 2015 ESPU conference. METHODS: Online programs for the targeted SPU Fall meetings and the 2015 ESPU Annual Meeting were retrospectively reviewed. Variables collected included meeting location and presenter home base. Distance traveled by the presenter, and likely CO2e of this return trip were estimated using online calculators. Analysis was performed using the Kruskal-Wallis-H test with pairwise comparisons to detect differences in round trip distances and CO2e between meeting locations. RESULTS: Six Fall SPU conferences and one ESPU conference were reviewed. The majority of presenters were from the region (North America and Europe, respectively), for both SPU and ESPU. The median round trip distance was 2596.34â¯miles (IQR 1420.96-4438.30), and the median CO2e 0.61 metric tons (IQR 0.36-1.02). We found that the distances traveled to conferences in the Western USA and Europe were slightly further than those to conferences in Central Canada and the Southern US. The difference in CO2e between these locations did not achieve statistical significance. CONCLUSION: Presenter travel to and from pediatric urological conferences generates an important carbon footprint and may not be possible in the medium-term future due to a global pandemic. We should explore strategies to allow meetings and knowledge exchange to continue whilst reducing the need for travel and the ecological burden of conferences.

There is an inherent relational structure to the relationship among different superpixels of an image. This relational information can convey some form of domain information about the image, e.g. relationship between superpixels representing two eyes in a cat image. Our interest in this paper is to construct computer vision models, specifically those based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to incorporate these superpixels information. We propose a methodology to construct a hybrid model that leverages (a) Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to deal with spatial information in an image, and (b) Graph Neural Network (GNN) to deal with relational superpixel information in the image. The proposed deep model is learned using a generic hybrid loss function that we call a `hybrid' loss. We evaluate the predictive performance of our proposed hybrid vision model on four popular image classification datasets: MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Moreover, we evaluate our method on three real-world classification tasks: COVID-19 X-Ray Detection, LFW Face Recognition, and SOCOFing Fingerprint Identification. The results demonstrate that the relational superpixel information provided via a GNN could improve the performance of standard CNN-based vision systems.","Chhablani, Gunjan; Sharma, Abheesht; Pandey, Harshit; Dash, Tirtharaj",,572,6

DESIGN: Cross sectional study. SETTING: Four hospitals in Wuhan, China. PARTICIPANTS: 420 healthcare professionals (116 doctors and 304 nurses) who were deployed to Wuhan by two affiliated hospitals of Sun Yat-sen University and Nanfang Hospital of Southern Medical University for 6-8 weeks from 24 January to 7 April 2020. These study participants were provided with appropriate personal protective equipment to deliver healthcare to patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 and were involved in aerosol generating procedures. 77 healthcare professionals with no exposure history to covid-19 and 80 patients who had recovered from covid-19 were recruited to verify the accuracy of antibody testing. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Covid-19 related symptoms (fever, cough, and dyspnoea) and evidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, defined as a positive test for virus specific nucleic acids in nasopharyngeal swabs, or a positive test for IgM or IgG antibodies in the serum samples. RESULTS: The average age of study participants was 35.8 years and 68.1% (286/420) were women. These study participants worked 4-6 hour shifts for an average of 5.4 days a week; they worked an average of 16.2 hours each week in intensive care units. All 420 study participants had direct contact with patients with covid-19 and performed at least one aerosol generating procedure. During the deployment period in Wuhan, none of the study participants reported covid-19 related symptoms. When the participants returned home, they all tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 specific nucleic acids and IgM or IgG antibodies (95% confidence interval 0.0 to 0.7%). CONCLUSION: Before a safe and effective vaccine becomes available, healthcare professionals remain susceptible to covid-19. Despite being at high risk of exposure, study participants were appropriately protected and did not contract infection or develop protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Healthcare systems must give priority to the procurement and distribution of personal protective equipment, and provide adequate training to healthcare professionals in its use.","Liu, Min; Cheng, Shou-Zhen; Xu, Ke-Wei; Yang, Yang; Zhu, Qing-Tang; Zhang, Hui; Yang, Da-Ya; Cheng, Shu-Yuan; Xiao, Han; Wang, Ji-Wen; Yao, He-Rui; Cong, Yu-Tian; Zhou, Yu-Qi; Peng, Sui; Kuang, Ming; Hou, Fan-Fan; Cheng, K K; Xiao, Hai-Peng",BMJ,572,1

The study examines to what extent politicians prefer increasing the role of government (directive state), transferring public tasks to private sector organizations (hollow state), transferring public tasks to third sector organizations (communitarian state), or downsizing and reducing the role of government without transferring tasks (coping state). The experiment primes decision‐makers on the pandemic's negative financial and economic prospects vis‐à‐vis its impact on health and well‐being. When negative economic prospects are emphasized, the study finds decreased preferences for a directive state and increased preferences for a coping state. The study concludes that how decision‐makers interpret the nature of a crisis determines their preferred response: An emphasis on the negative economic prospects of the COVID‐19 pandemic is likely to increase preferences for renewed policies of austerity.","van der Voet, Joris",Public Adm,572,16

Fasting, which requires abstinence from food and drink from dawn to sunset can be up to 20 hours duration during the summer months in temperate regions. Fasting can especially be challenging in patients on haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, moreover, there is concern that those with Chronic Kidney Disease can experience electrolyte imbalance and worsening of renal function. In this paper, current literature is reviewed and a decision-making management tool has been developed to assist clinicians in discussing the risks of fasting in patients with CKD, with consideration also given to circumstances such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Our review highlights that patients with CKD wishing to fast should undergo a thorough risk assessment ideally within a month before Ramadan, they may require medication changes and a plan for regular monitoring of renal function and electrolytes in order to fast safely. Recommendations have been based on risk tiers (very high risk, high risk and low/moderate risk) established by the International Diabetes Federation and the Diabetes and Ramadan International Alliance. Patients in the ‘Very high risk’ and ‘High Risk’ categories should be encouraged to explore alternative options to fasting, those in the low/moderate category may be able to fast safely with guidance from their clinician. Prior to the commencement of Ramadan, all patients must receive up-to-date education on sick day rules, instructions on when to terminate their fast or abstain from fasting.","Malik, Shafi; Bhanji, Amir; Abuleiss, Husham; Hamer, Rizwan; Shah, Shahzad H; Rashad, Rafaqat; Junglee, Naushad; Waqar, Salman; Ghouri, Nazim",Clin Kidney J,572,30

The Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework aims to improve the sharing of influenza viruses with pandemic potential and increase access of developing countries to vaccines and other life-saving products during a pandemic. Under the Framework, countries have been supported to enhance their capacities to detect, prepare for and respond to pandemic influenza. In the Eastern Mediterranean Region, seven countries are priority countries for Laboratory and Surveillance (L&S) support: Afghanistan, Djibouti, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco and Yemen. During 2014–2017, US$ 2.7 million was invested in regional capacity-building and US$ 4.6 million directly in the priority countries. Countries were supported to strengthen influenza diagnostic capacities to improve detection, enhance influenza surveillance systems including sentinel surveillance for severe acute respiratory infection and influenza-like illness, and increase global sharing of surveillance data and influenza viruses. This paper highlights the progress made in improving influenza preparedness and response capacities in the Region from 2014 to 2017, and the challenges faced. By 2017, 18 of the 22 countries of the Region had laboratory-testing capacity, 19 had functioning sentinel influenza surveillance systems and 22 had trained national rapid response teams. The number of countries correctly identifying all influenza viruses in the WHO external quality assurance panel increased from 9 countries scoring 100% in 2014 to 15 countries in 2017, and the number sharing influenza viruses with WHO collaborating centres increased by 75% (from eight to 14 countries); more than half now share influenza data with regional or global surveillance platforms. Seven countries have estimated influenza disease burden and seven have introduced influenza vaccination for high-risk groups. Challenges included: protracted complex emergencies faced by nine countries which hindered implementation of influenza surveillance in areas with the most needs, high staff turnover, achieving timely virus sharing and limited utilization of influenza data where they are available to inform vaccine policies or establish threshold values to measure the start and severity of influenza seasons.","Abubakar, Abdinasir; Elkholy, Amgad; Barakat, Amal; Shrestha, Bhagawan; Elhakim, Mohamed; Malik, Mamunur Rahman; Bergeri, Isabel; Samaan, Gina",J Infect Public Health,572,1

However, the empirical use of antibiotics is still confusing. Presently, a total of 1123 patients with COVID-19 admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University was included in this retrospective cohort study. The clinical features, complications and outcomes were compared between the suspected bacterial infection and the no evidence of bacterial infection. The risk factors of mortality and the incidence of acute organ injury were analyzed. As a result, 473 patients were selected to suspected bacterial infection (SI) group based on higher white blood cell count and procalcitonin or bacterial pneumonia on chest radiography. 650 patients were selected to the no evidence of bacterial infection (NI) group. The SI group had more severely ill patients (70.2% vs. 39.8%), more death (20.5% vs. 2.2%), and more acute organ injury (40.2% vs. 11.2%). Antibiotics were found associated with improved mortality and an increased risk for acute organ injury in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Intravenous moxifloxacin and meropenem increased the death rate in patients with suspected bacterial infection, while oral antibiotics reduced mortality in this group. Moreover, penicillin and meropenem treatments were associated with increased mortality of the patients with no evidence of bacterial infection. In conclusion, patients with suspected bacterial infection were more likely to have negative clinical outcomes than those without bacterial infection.

From the first days, researchers have tried to discover vaccines to combat the epidemic. Several vaccines are now available as a result of the contributions of those researchers. As a matter of fact, the available vaccines should be used in effective and efficient manners to put the pandemic to an end. Hence, a major problem now is how to efficiently distribute these available vaccines among various components of the population. Using mathematical modeling and reinforcement learning control approaches, the present article aims to address this issue. To this end, a deterministic Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered-type model with additional vaccine components is proposed. The proposed mathematical model can be used to simulate the consequences of vaccination policies. Then, the suppression of the outbreak is taken to account. The main objective is to reduce the effects of Covid-19 and its domino effects which stem from its spreading and progression. Therefore, to reach optimal policies, reinforcement learning optimal control is implemented, and four different optimal strategies are extracted. Demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed methods, finally, numerical simulations are presented.","Beigi, Alireza; Yousefpour, Amin; Yasami, Amirreza; Gómez-Aguilar, J.

Ending the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic requires implementation of multiple population-wide strategies, including social distancing, testing and contact tracing. We propose a new model that predicts the course of the epidemic to help plan an effective control strategy. The model considers eight stages of infection: susceptible (S), infected (I), diagnosed (D), ailing (A), recognized (R), threatened (T), healed (H) and extinct (E), collectively termed SIDARTHE. Our SIDARTHE model discriminates between infected individuals depending on whether they have been diagnosed and on the severity of their symptoms. The distinction between diagnosed and non-diagnosed individuals is important because the former are typically isolated and hence less likely to spread the infection. This delineation also helps to explain misperceptions of the case fatality rate and of the epidemic spread. We compare simulation results with real data on the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, and we model possible scenarios of implementation of countermeasures. Our results demonstrate that restrictive social-distancing measures will need to be combined with widespread testing and contact tracing to end the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Giordano, Giulia; Blanchini, Franco; Bruno, Raffaele; Colaneri, Patrizio; Di Filippo, Alessandro; Di Matteo, Angela; Colaneri, Marta",Nat Med,572,33

We used a national survey of representatively sampled households (n = 13,021 adults) from October to December 2020. A self-report questionnaire asked about vaccination intention and reasons for hesitancy and gathered data on socio-demographic, demographic, psychological, and experiential factors. Our study indicated that 39.8% of the participants answered that they hesitated or refused to be vaccinated. The most common reason for vaccine hesitancy was a lack of confidence in the COVID-19 vaccine (77.9%).

Data analyses included descriptive statistics, psychometric analyses of the 5C and CoBQ tools, one-way ANOVA to compare demographic groups and vaccine intention items with survey scores, and mapping and path analysis of the HBM with one added domain (Decision Making Determinant, DMD). RESULTS: 525 respondents completed the survey from October 23–29, 2020. Respondents aged 18–49, making less than $20,000 or an undisclosed income, and not having anyone close to them directly affected by COVID-19 showed a significant, negative impact of COVID-19 on health behavior and a significantly lower vaccine acceptance. The 5C and CoBQ showed moderately strong reliability. Mapping for the HBM revealed significant correlations between all modifying factors with Individual Perceptions except for Race/Ethnicity. Of the Individual Perceptions, Perceived Benefits (-.114) and Perceived Barriers (.307) significantly predicted DMD and directly impacted Vaccine Intention. DMD was not a significant mediator of Vaccination Intention. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination messaging should focus on a simple yet balanced view of benefits and risks, targeting those under age 50 and living in low-income households, to motivate uptake of influenza and COVID-19 vaccines.","Mercadante, Amanda R.; Law, Anandi V.",Res Social Adm Pharm,572,24

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) recognize the heightened risks of Covid-19 for older adults; however, both organizations presuppose that most cases of Covid-19 will be mild to moderate and recoverable at home. Yet, older adults are least likely to follow this trajectory. Older patients are more susceptible to experiencing severe illness at home from which they may not recover; and if they do seek medical care, they tend to suffer worse outcomes than younger patients in intensive care settings. Given their likelihood of severe illness, worse outcomes in intensive care settings, and potential difficulty accessing resources, frail, disabled, and otherwise vulnerable older patients may face Covid-19 at home without adequate resources, information, or support for home-based care. This editorial proposes three approaches to prevent needless suffering and ensure that this vulnerable population continues to receive needed care.","Fallon, Cara Kiernan; Kilbride, Madison K.",Prev Med,572,26

Thailand, China, and Vietnam had set out a strategic vision to strengthen future capacity in preparedness planning. By contrast, Hong Kong, Australia, and New Zealand took a strategic approach aimed mainly at harnessing available resources or preparing for the deployment of resources such as stockpiled antiviral agents and vaccines. The plans of Hong Kong, Australia, and New Zealand compared favourably with the best European plans. The plans of resource-poor countries addressed some issues that were largely neglected by most European plans.

The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore the challenges of healthcare workers (HCWs) involved in providing DR-TB care in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Methods: We conducted in-depth interviews with 18 HCWs purposively selected from 10 healthcare facilities in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. We then transcribed the audiotaped interviews, and thematically analysed the transcripts using Braun and Clark’s reflexive thematic analysis framework. Results: We identified five major themes: 1) inadequate training and provision of information on DR-TB to HCWs assigned to work in DR-TB services, 2) fear of DR-TB infection, 3) risk of contracting DR-TB, 4) a heavy workload, and 5) resource limitations. Conclusion: Our findings highlight major human resource constraints that current DR-TB care policies need to foresee and accommodate. New evidence and best practices on what works in DR-TB care in such resource-limited countries are needed in order to address implementation gaps and to meet global TB strategies.","Mussie, Kirubel Manyazewal; Gradmann, Christoph; Yimer, Solomon Abebe; Manyazewal, Tsegahun",Int J Public Health,572,20

By introducing two sensitivity parameters for the instabilities of the top and bottom boundary layers, we find three different types of solutions, namely in-phase single-period oscillations, multi-period oscillations and chaos. The chaos solution contains rare but large amplitude fluctuations. The statistical properties of these fluctuations are consistent with those observed in the experiment for the massive eruption of thermal plumes, which causes random reversals of the large-scale circulation in turbulent Rayleigh–Bénard convection. Our study thus provides new insights into the origin of rare massive eruptions and sudden changes of large-scale flow pattern that are often observed in convection systems of geophysical and astrophysical scales.","Wang, Yin; Xu, Wei; Lai, Pik-Yin; Tong, Penger",Nonlinear Dyn,572,24

The resulting data provide a rare opportunity to measure key metrics of disease course, transmission, and the impact of control measures. METHODS: From Jan 14 to Feb 12, 2020, the Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention identified 391 SARS-CoV-2 cases and 1286 close contacts. We compared cases identified through symptomatic surveillance and contact tracing, and estimated the time from symptom onset to confirmation, isolation, and admission to hospital. We estimated metrics of disease transmission and analysed factors influencing transmission risk. FINDINGS: Cases were older than the general population (mean age 45 years) and balanced between males (n=187) and females (n=204). 356 (91%) of 391 cases had mild or moderate clinical severity at initial assessment. As of Feb 22, 2020, three cases had died and 225 had recovered (median time to recovery 21 days; 95% CI 20–22). Cases were isolated on average 4·6 days (95% CI 4·1–5·0) after developing symptoms; contact tracing reduced this by 1·9 days (95% CI 1·1–2·7). Household contacts and those travelling with a case were at higher risk of infection (odds ratio 6·27 [95% CI 1·49–26·33] for household contacts and 7·06 [1·43–34·91] for those travelling with a case) than other close contacts. The household secondary attack rate was 11·2% (95% CI 9·1–13·8), and children were as likely to be infected as adults (infection rate 7·4% in children <10 years vs population average of 6·6%). The observed reproductive number (R) was 0·4 (95% CI 0·3–0·5), with a mean serial interval of 6·3 days (95% CI 5·2–7·6). INTERPRETATION: Our data on cases as well as their infected and uninfected close contacts provide key insights into the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. This analysis shows that isolation and contact tracing reduce the time during which cases are infectious in the community, thereby reducing the R. The overall impact of isolation and contact tracing, however, is uncertain and highly dependent on the number of asymptomatic cases. Moreover, children are at a similar risk of infection to the general population, although less likely to have severe symptoms; hence they should be considered in analyses of transmission and control.

Elucidating principles of molecular recognition governing important interfaces such as coiled coils is a challenging goal for structural and systems biology. We report here that two valine-containing mutants of the GCN4 leucine zipper that fold individually as four-stranded coiled coils associate preferentially in mixtures to form an antiparallel, heterotetrameric structure. X-ray crystallographic analysis reveals that the coinciding hydrophobic interfaces of the hetero- and homotetramers differ in detail, explaining their partnering and structural specificity. Equilibrium disulfide exchange and thermal denaturation experiments show that the 50-fold preference for heterospecificity results from a combination of preferential packing and hydrophobicity. The extent of preference is sensitive to the side chains comprising the interface. Thus, heterotypic versus homotypic interaction specificity in coiled coils reflects a delicate balance in complementarity of shape and chemistry of the participating side chains.","Deng, Yiqun; Liu, Jie; Zheng, Qi; Li, Qunnu; Kallenbach, Neville R.; Lu, Min",Chem Biol,572,24

Existing pandemic plans in Canada, however, do not adequately incorporate family physicians’ roles and perspectives. This policy and planning oversight has become increasingly evident with the emergence of the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, pandemic. This study is designed to inform the development of pandemic plans for primary care through evidence from four provinces in Canada: British Columbia, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, and Ontario. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will employ a multiple-case study of regions in four provinces. Each case consists of a mixed methods design which comprises: (1) a chronology of family physician roles in the COVID-19 pandemic response; (2) a provincial policy analysis; and (3) qualitative interviews with family physicians. Relevant policy and guidance documents will be identified through targeted, snowball and general search strategies. Additionally, these policy documents will be analysed to identify gaps and/or emphases in existing policies and policy responses. Interviews will explore family physicians’ proposed, actual and potential roles during the pandemic, the facilitators and barriers they have encountered throughout and the influence of gender on their professional roles. Data will be thematically analysed using a content analysis framework, first at the regional level and then through cross-case analyses. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Approval for this study has been granted by the Research Ethics of British Columbia, the Health Research Ethics Board of Newfoundland and Labrador, the Nova Scotia Health Authority Research Ethics Board and the Western University Research Ethics Board. Findings will be disseminated via conferences and peer-reviewed publications. Evidence and lessons learnt will be used to develop tools for government ministries, public health units and family physicians for improved pandemic response plans for primary care.","Mathews, Maria; Spencer, Sarah; Hedden, Lindsay; Marshall, Emily Gard; Lukewich, Julia; Meredith, Leslie; Ryan, Dana; Buote, Richard; Liu, Tiffany; Volpe, Emily; Gill, Paul S; Ryan, Bridget; Schacter, Gordon; Wickett, Jamie; Freeman, Thomas R; Sibbald, Shannon L; Wong, Eric; McKay, Maddi; McCracken, Rita; Brown, Judith Belle",BMJ Open,572,22

Assessing the effectiveness of the individual interventions is critical to inform future preparedness response plans. Here we quantify the impact of 4,579 NPIs implemented in 76 territories on the effective reproduction number, Rt, of COVID-19. We use a hierarchically coded data set of NPIs and propose a novel modelling approach that combines four computational techniques, which together allow for a worldwide consensus rank of the NPIs based on their effectiveness in mitigating the spread of COVID-19. We show how the effectiveness of individual NPIs strongly varies across countries and world regions, and in relation to human and economic development as well as different dimensions of governance. We quantify the effectiveness of each NPI with respect to the epidemic age of its adoption, i.e., how early into the epidemics. The emerging picture is one in which no one-fits-all solution exists, and no single NPI alone can decrease Rt below one and that a combination of NPIs is necessary to curb the spread of the virus. We show that there are NPIs considerably less intrusive and costly than lockdowns that are also highly effective, such as certain risk communication strategies and voluntary measures that strengthen the healthcare system. By allowing to simulate ``what-if'' scenarios at the country level, our approach opens the way for planning the most likely effectiveness of future NPIs.","Haug, N.; Geyrhofer, L.; Londei, A.; Dervic, E.; Desvars-Larrive, A.; Loreto, V.; Pinior, B.; Thurner, S.; Klimek, P.",,572,24

Given the harms of the COVID-19 pandemic and the now-known efficacy of the vaccines in adults and teens, the question of whether clinical equipoise exists for a placebo-controlled trial of vaccines in younger children remains. Parents may be reluctant to enroll children in these trials because they want their child to receive the vaccine or because they are worried about vaccines or clinical trials in general. One option for gathering data on tolerability and efficacy in children would be to use a nonrandomized trial to enroll parents willing to vaccinate their children and those who are hesitant.

Methods We provided tocilizumab on a compassionate-use basis to patients with SSP hospitalized (excluding intensive care and intubated cases) who required oxygen support to have a saturation >93%. Primary endpoint was intubation or death after 24 hours of its administration. Patients received at least one dose of 400 mg intravenous tocilizumab during March 8-2020, through April 20-2020. Findings A total of 207 patients were studied and 186 analysed. The mean age was 65 years and 68% were male. A co-existing condition was present in 68 % of cases.

There are speculations that the COVID-19 mortality differences between regions are due to the disparities in the availability of medical resources. Therefore, the selection of patients for diagnosis and treatment is essential in this situation. Military personnel are especially at risk for infectious diseases; thus, patient selection with an evidence-based prognostic model is critical for them. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the usability of a novel platform used in the military hospitals in Korea to gather data and deploy patient selection solutions for COVID-19. METHODS: The platform’s structure was developed to provide users with prediction results and to use the data to enhance the prediction models. Two applications were developed: a patient’s application and a physician’s application. The primary outcome was requiring an oxygen supplement. The outcome prediction model was developed with patients from four centers. A Cox proportional hazards model was developed. The outcome of the model for the patient’s application was the length of time from the date of hospitalization to the date of the first oxygen supplement use. The demographic characteristics, past history, patient symptoms, social history, and body temperature were considered as risk factors. A usability study with the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ) was conducted on the physician’s application on 50 physicians. RESULTS: The patient’s application and physician’s application were deployed on the web for wider availability. A total of 246 patients from four centers were used to develop the outcome prediction model. A small percentage (n=18, 7.32%) of the patients needed professional care. The variables included in the developed prediction model were age; body temperature; predisease physical status; history of cardiovascular disease; hypertension; visit to a region with an outbreak; and symptoms of chills, feverishness, dyspnea, and lethargy. The overall C statistic was 0.963 (95% CI 0.936-0.99), and the time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ranged from 0.976 at day 3 to 0.979 at day 9. The usability of the physician’s application was good, with an overall average of the responses to the PSSUQ being 2.2 (SD 1.1). CONCLUSIONS: The platform introduced in this study enables evidence-based patient selection in an effortless and timely manner, which is critical in the military. With a well-designed user experience and an accurate prediction model, this platform may help save lives and contain the spread of the novel virus, COVID-19.","Heo, JoonNyung; Park, Ji Ae; Han, Deokjae; Kim, Hyung-Jun; Ahn, Daeun; Ha, Beomman; Seog, Woong; Park, Yu Rang",J Med Internet Res,572,1

In recent years, there has been greater awareness of the ways in which climate-sensitive infectious diseases pose a growing threat to global public health. OBJECTIVE: To categorize and describe the effects of climate change on infectious diseases with skin manifestations. METHODS: A scoping review of the MEDLINE and PubMed online databases for climate-sensitive infections was performed in February and March 2020. A representative selection of conditions with skin manifestations was included in this review. RESULTS: Several representative climate-sensitive infectious diseases were identified in each the following categories: (1) vector-borne infectious diseases, (2) infectious diseases associated with extreme weather events, and (3) infectious diseases linked to human migration. CONCLUSIONS: Climate variables directly influence the survival and reproduction of infectious microorganisms, their vectors, and their animal reservoirs. Due to sustained warmer temperatures at higher latitudes, climate change has expanded the geographic range of certain pathogenic microbes. More frequent climate change-related extreme weather events create circumstances where existing infectious microorganisms flourish and novel infections emerge. Climate instability is linked to increased human migration, which disrupts healthcare infrastructure as well as the habitats of microbes, vectors, and animal reservoirs, and also leads to widespread poverty and overcrowding. Dermatologists should understand that climate change will affect the burden and geographic distribution of infectious diseases, many of which have cutaneous signs and might be encountered in their regular practice.","Coates, Sarah J; Norton, Scott A",Int J Womens Dermatol,572,33

Background and aim: The knowledge about the acute kidney injury (AKI) incidence in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can help health teams to carry out a targeted care plan. This study aimed to determine the AKI incidence in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Methods: The electronic search covered research published until June 20, 2020, and included five databases, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and Lilacs (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Library). Eligible studies were those including data from AKI occurrence in adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The primary outcome was AKI incidence, and the secondary outcome assessed was the AKI mortality. Additionally, the estimated incidence of renal replacement therapy (RRT) need also was verified. Using a standardized form prepared in Microsoft Excel, data were extracted by two independents authors, regarding the description of studies, characteristics of patients and clinical data on the AKI occurrence. Results: We included 30 studies in this systematic review, of which 28 were included in the meta-analysis. Data were assessed from 18,043 adult patients with COVID-19. The AKI estimate incidence overall and at the ICU was 9.2% (4.6 – 13.9) and 32.6% (8.5 – 56.6), respectively. AKI estimate incidence in the elderly patients and those with acute respiratory disease syndrome was 22.9% (-4.0 – 49.7) and 4.3% (1.8 – 6.8), respectively. Patients with secondary infection, AKI estimate incidence was 31.6% (12.3 – 51.0). The estimate incidence of patients that required RRT was 3.2% (1.1 – 5.4) and estimate AKI mortality was 50.4% (17.0 – 83.9). Conclusion: The occurrence of AKI is frequent among adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19, and affects on average, up to 13.9% of these patients. It is believed that AKI occurs early and in parallel with lung injury.","Santos, Reginaldo Passoni dos; Lordani, Tarcísio Vitor Augusto; Peres, Luis Alberto Batista; Carvalho, Ariana Rodrigues da Silva",Nefrologia,572,1
597331,597331,597331,Surveillance for Adverse Events After COVID-19 mRNA Vaccination,16.150723,6.469257,2021,"BACKGROUND: The mechanisms by which viruses cause asthma exacerbations are not precisely known. Previously, we showed that, in ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized and -challenged mice with allergic airway inflammation, rhinovirus (RV) infection increases type 2 cytokine production from alternatively-activated (M2) airway macrophages, enhancing eosinophilic inflammation and airways hyperresponsiveness. In this paper, we tested the hypothesis that IL-4 signaling determines the state of macrophage activation and pattern of RV-induced exacerbation in mice with allergic airways disease. METHODS: Eight week-old wild type or IL-4 receptor knockout (IL-4R KO) mice were sensitized and challenged with OVA and inoculated with RV1B or sham HeLa cell lysate. RESULTS: In contrast to OVA-treated wild-type mice with both neutrophilic and eosinophilic airway inflammation, OVA-treated IL-4R KO mice showed increased neutrophilic inflammation with few eosinophils in the airways. Like wild-type mice, IL-4R KO mice showed OVA-induced airway hyperreactivity which was further exacerbated by RV. There was a shift in lung cytokines from a type 2-predominant response to a type 1 response, including production of IL-12p40 and TNF-α. IL-17A was also increased. RV infection of OVA-treated IL-4R KO mice further increased neutrophilic inflammation. Bronchoalveolar macrophages showed an M1 polarization pattern and ex vivo RV infection increased macrophage production of TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL-12p40. Finally, lung cells from OVA-treated IL-4R KO mice showed reduced CD206+ CD301+ M2 macrophages, decreased IL-13 and increased TNF-α and IL-17A production by F4/80+, CD11b+ macrophages. CONCLUSIONS: OVA-treated IL-4R KO mice show neutrophilic airway inflammation constituting a model of allergic, type 1 cytokine-driven neutrophilic asthma. In the absence of IL-4/IL-13 signaling, RV infection of OVA-treated mice increased type 1 cytokine and IL-17A production from conventionally-activated macrophages, augmenting neutrophilic rather than eosinophilic inflammation. In mice with allergic airways inflammation, IL-4R signaling determines macrophage activation state and the response to subsequent RV infection.","Hong, Jun Young; Chung, Yutein; Steenrod, Jessica; Chen, Qiang; Lei, Jing; Comstock, Adam T; Goldsmith, Adam M; Bentley, J Kelley; Sajjan, Uma S; Hershenson, Marc B",Respir Res,572,12

Objective: The purpose of this paper is to describe the relationship between mental health symptoms, binge drinking, and the experience of abuse during the COVID-19 lockdown. Method: We surveyed 9,361 participants, all Mexican, with an average age of 33 years old (SD = 10.86). In this group of people, we found out that 59% were single (5,523), 71% were women (6,693). Forty-six percentage were complying with lockdown procedures (4,286), 50% were partially complying (4,682), and 4% were not complying at all (393). The invitation to participate was open from April 24th to April 30th during the second stage of the pandemic in Mexico, in 2020, characterized by voluntary complete lockdown staying at home. Thus, we used a cross-sectional online survey design to assess mental health risk factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey was available on a WebApp designed by Linux(®), PHP(®), HTML(®), CSS(®), and JavaScript(®). We calculated descriptive and inferential analysis to describe the mental health average distribution as a function of the lockdown, binge drinking, and experience of abuse. To calculate the reliability and validation of the subscales, we used Cronbach's Alpha and Factor Loading. We run the confirmatory factor loading analysis, and we described the relationship between each latent variable and its item factor load, obtained through structural modeling equations, derived from 179 iterations and 207 parameters (t([1,171]) = 28,079.418, p < 0.001). We got a CFI of 0.947, a TLC of 0.940, an RMSEA of 0.049 (0.049–0.050), and an SRMR of 0.048. Findings: The results indicated that reported attitudes such as avoidance, sadness, withdrawal, anger, and anxiety were associated with acute stress, which was linked to an anxiety condition caused by uncertainty about achieving or maintaining overall good health. Discussion and Prospects: People in lockdown mentioned a sudden increase in alcohol consumption. They lived episodes of physical and emotional abuse, in contrast with those who stated that they did not go into lockdown or consume alcohol, or experienced abuse. Limitations: Further studies should diagnose mental health conditions as part of the impact of COVID-19, ensure their follow-up, and assess the effect of providing remote psychological care. There is a need to explore methods to curb the increase in the number of people affected by post-traumatic stress disorder.","Morales Chainé, Silvia; López Montoya, Alejandra; Bosch Maldonado, Alejandro; Beristain Aguirre, Ana; Robles García, Rebeca; Garibay Rubio, Carlos Rodrigo; Astudillo García, Claudia Iveth; Lira Chávez, Isaura Angélica; Rangel Gómez, María Gudelia",Front Public Health,572,8

To assess whether this impaired our ability to detect and control early introductions of the virus into the UK, we PCR-tested archival specimens collected on admission to a large UK teaching hospital who retrospectively were identified as having a clinical presentation compatible with COVID-19. In addition, we screened available archival specimens submitted for respiratory virus diagnosis, and dating back to early January 2020, for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Our data provides evidence for widespread community circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in early February 2020 and into March that was undetected at the time due to restrictive case definitions informing testing policy. Genome sequence data showed that many of these early cases were infected with a distinct lineage of the virus. Sequences obtained from the first officially recorded case in Nottinghamshire - a traveller returning from Daegu, South Korea – also clustered with these early UK sequences suggesting acquisition of the virus occurred in the UK and not Daegu. Analysis of a larger sample of sequences obtained in the Nottinghamshire area revealed multiple viral introductions, mainly in late February and through March. These data highlight the importance of timely and extensive community testing to prevent future widespread transmission of the virus.","Chappell, Joseph G.; Tsoleridis, Theocharis; Clark, Gemma; Berry, Louise; Holmes, Nadine; Moore, Christopher; Carlile, Matthew; Sang, Fei; Debebe, Bisrat J.; Wright, Victoria; Irving, William L.; Thomson, Brian J.; Boswell, Timothy C.

We draw on current mortality and case data, alongside pre‐crisis labour force data to investigate the relative vulnerability of different ethnic groups to adverse health and economic impacts. After accounting for differences in population structure and regional concentration, we show that most minority groups have suffered excess mortality compared to the white British majority group. Differences in underlying health conditions such as diabetes may play a role; so too may occupational exposure to the virus, given the very different labour market profiles of ethnic groups. Distinctive patterns of occupational concentration also highlight the vulnerability of some groups to the economic consequences of social distancing measures, with Bangladeshi and Pakistani men particularly likely to be employed in occupations directly affected by the UK's ‘lockdown’. We show that differences in household structures and inequalities in access to savings mean that a number of minority groups are also less likely to be able to weather short‐term shocks to their income. Documenting these immediate consequences of the crisis reveals the potential for inequalities to become entrenched in the longer term. This article is protected by copyright.

Growing hand, foot and mouth disease outbreaks were observed worldwide in recent years and caused devastating losses both economically and politically. However, vaccines or effective drugs are unavailable to date. The genome of EV71 consists of a positive sense, single-stranded RNA of ∼ 7400 bp, encoding a large precursor polyprotein that requires proteolytic processing to generate mature viral proteins. The proteolytic processing mainly depends on EV71 3C protease (3C(pro)) that possesses both proteolysis and RNA binding activities, which enable the protease to perform multiple tasks in viral replication and pathogen–host interactions. The central roles played by EV71 3C(pro) make it an appealing target for antiviral drug development. We determined the first crystal structure of EV71 3C(pro) and analyzed its enzymatic activity. The crystal structure shows that EV71 3C(pro) has a typical chymotrypsin-like fold that is common in picornaviral 3C(pro). Strikingly, we found an important surface loop, also denoted as β-ribbon, which adopts a novel open conformation in EV71 3C(pro). We identified two important residues located at the base of the β-ribbon, Gly123 and His133, which form hinges that govern the intrinsic flexibility of the ribbon. Structure-guided mutagenesis studies revealed that the hinge residues are important to EV71 3C(pro) proteolytic activities. In summary, our work provides the first structural insight into EV71 3C(pro), including a mobile β-ribbon, which is relevant to the proteolytic mechanism. Our data also provides a framework for structure-guided inhibitor design against EV71 3C(pro).","Cui, Sheng; Wang, Jing; Fan, Tingting; Qin, Bo; Guo, Li; Lei, Xiaobo; Wang, Jianwei; Wang, Meitian; Jin, Qi",J Mol Biol,572,16

The need to stay apprised of new information has also created a critical role for mass media and public institutions in shaping the public’s knowledge of, attitudes about, and responses to the unfolding pandemic. In this study, we examine how media consumption and reliance on specific institutions for information shapes three critical outcomes associated with public health epidemics: the accumulation of knowledge and the endorsement of misinformation about COVID-19, and prejudicial responses to the virus. We surveyed 1,141 adults residing across the United States in March 2020. Using multivariate regression and t-tests, we found that participants had greater knowledge, were less likely to endorse misinformation, and reported less bias toward Asian Americans when they had higher trust in the CDC and lower trust in President Trump. Reliance on certain news formats and sources was also associated with knowledge, misinformation, and prejudice. Our findings suggest that trust and news consumption can pose critical barriers to health literacy and foster negative prejudicial responses that further undermine public health efforts surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic.","Dhanani, Lindsay Y.; Franz, Berkeley",Front Psychol,572,1

The standard practice of monitoring thyroid function using thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) to adjust levothyroxine (LT4) dose does not apply to bexarotene since it causes CH. In CH, TSH is not reliable. Hence free tetraiodothyronine (fT(4)) level is used to monitor and adjust the LT4 dose. We report a case of an 81-year-old Caucasian male with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) who was treated with bexarotene. His pre-treatment TSH was normal at 1.6 µIU/mL (reference range: 0.46-4.68 µIU/mL). Post-bexarotene, the total tetraiodothyronine (T(4)) level was within the reference range, but a downward trend was noted. Eventually, total triiodothyronine (T(3)) dropped to a low level of 0.61 ng/mL (reference range: 0.97-1.69 ng/mL), and LT4 was initiated. Bexarotene dose was increased, but LT4 was not increased by the primary physician who relied on TSH level, which was low, and hence the existing LT4 dose was maintained. The patient had persistent symptoms of hypothyroidism and, eventually, a diagnosis of CH was made. The symptoms of hypothyroidism improved after normalizing fT(4), with an increase in the LT4 dose. This case represents an example of missed CH due to bexarotene, ­which led to suboptimal LT4 replacement impacting the quality of life for the patient.","Pattan, Vishwanath; Schaab, Kira; Sundaresh, Vishnu",Cureus,572,6

Since the SARS-CoV-2 virus shares extensive homology with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, effective therapies for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV may also have therapeutic potential for the current COVID-19 outbreak. To identify therapeutics that might be repositioned for treatment of the SARS-CoV-2 disease COVID-19, we strategically reviewed the literature to identify existing therapeutics with evidence of efficacy for the treatment of the three coronaviruses that cause severe respiratory illness (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2). Mechanistic and in vitro analyses suggest multiple promising therapeutic options with potential for repurposing to treat patients with COVID-19. Therapeutics with particularly high potential efficacy for repurposing include camostat mesylate, remdesivir, favipiravir, tocilizumab, baricitinib, convalescent plasma, and humanized monoclonal antibodies. Camostat mesylate has shown therapeutic potential, likely by preventing viral entry into epithelial cells. In early research, the targeted antivirals remdesivir and favipiravir appear to benefit patients by decreasing viral replication; clinical trials suggest that remdesivir speeds recovery from COVID-19. Tocilizumab and baricitinib appear to improve mortality by preventing a severe cytokine storm. Convalescent plasma and humanized monoclonal antibodies offer passive immunity and decreased recovery time. This review highlights potential therapeutic options that may be repurposed to treat COVID-19 and suggests opportunities for further research.","Santos, Jennifer; Brierley, Stephanie; Gandhi, Mohit J.; Cohen, Michael A.; Moschella, Phillip C.; Declan, Arwen B.

However, our knowledge of the effect of a specific lack of education, such as in mathematics, is currently poor but is highly relevant given the extant differences between countries in their educational curricula and the differences in opportunities to access education. Here we examined whether neurotransmitter concentrations in the adolescent brain could classify whether a student is lacking mathematical education. Decreased γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentration within the middle frontal gyrus (MFG) successfully classified whether an adolescent studies math and was negatively associated with frontoparietal connectivity. In a second experiment, we uncovered that our findings were not due to preexisting differences before a mathematical education ceased. Furthermore, we showed that MFG GABA not only classifies whether an adolescent is studying math or not, but it also predicts the changes in mathematical reasoning ∼19 mo later. The present results extend previous work in animals that has emphasized the role of GABA neurotransmission in synaptic and network plasticity and highlight the effect of a specific lack of education on MFG GABA concentration and learning-dependent plasticity. Our findings reveal the reciprocal effect between brain development and education and demonstrate the negative consequences of a specific lack of education during adolescence on brain plasticity and cognitive functions.","Zacharopoulos, George; Sella, Francesco; Cohen Kadosh, Roi",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,572,7

Using data from the Understanding America Study (UAS), we examined the association between EDs and mental health and how the relationship changed over time across the months following the institution of virus containment procedures (e.g., social distancing, quarantine). METHOD: The analytic sample consisted of 7137 adults (Mage =50.58 years; SD =16.10) who completed surveys between waves 1–11 of the UAS study. Participants self-reported ED diagnosis (i.e., yes, no, or unsure) and completed self-report measures of psychological distress, perceived stress, and loneliness. Multilevel models were used to compare trajectories of psychological distress, perceived stress, and loneliness among ED groups. RESULTS: Individuals with EDs and unsure EDs had higher levels of psychological distress, perceived stress, and loneliness compared to those without EDs. Those unsure about their EDs showed initial decreases in perceived stress and loneliness but started increasing again after some time. Levels of loneliness among those with EDs increased initially but later began to decrease; individuals with EDs showed steady decreases in perceived stress. LIMITATIONS: Type, severity, and duration of EDs were unspecified in the self-reported measure of EDs, which could differentiate the trajectories of outcomes.

Children with malignancy are particularly at risk of developing conditions that may require CRRT. We reported three children with malignancy who received CRRT for non-AKI indications. Patient 1 was a 17-year-old teenage girl who developed refractory type B lactic acidosis due to relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Her peak lactate level was 18 mmol/L, and the lowest pH and bicarbonate level was 7.13 and 6.0 mmol/L, respectively. She received three sessions of high-volume hemodiafiltration to bring down the lactate level. Patient 2 was a 15-year-old male with T-cell ALL who developed cytokine storm requiring mechanical ventilatory and high-dose inotropic support due to necrotizing enterocolitis complicated by pneumoperitoneum and Klebsiella pneumoniae septicemia. He received two sessions of hemoperfusion using a specific filter capable of endotoxin absorption and cytokine removal and was successfully weaned off all inotropes after the treatment. Patient 3 was an 8-year-old boy who received bone marrow transplantation and developed worsening hyperbilirubinemia and deteriorating liver function. He received a session of single-pass albumin dialysis for bilirubin removal prior to liver biopsy. Except for mild electrolyte disturbances, no major CRRT complication was encountered. Our report demonstrated that CRRT is an effective and safe procedure for a wide spectrum of nonrenal conditions among children with oncological diagnoses in the pediatric intensive care unit. However, the optimal dose, regime, timing of initiation, and monitoring target for these indications remain to be determined.","Hui, Wun Fung; Hon, Kam Lun; Leung, Alexander K.

Palivizumab is the only immunoprophylaxis therapy approved for RSV infection in infants with hemodynamically significant acyanotic or cyanotic CHD. OBJECTIVE: Identify the compliance rate with vaccination and study the effect of RSV vaccination on hospital admissions. DESIGN: Retrospective descriptive study. SETTING: Cardiac center. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patient data was obtained from outpatient clinic records, inpatient records, and a surgical database for the period from October 2010 to March 2016. Infants with hemodynamically significant CHD, cyanotic CHD and moderate-to-severe pulmonary hypertension were included in the study. Palivizumab 15/mg/kg was given monthly starting from October, the usual beginning of the epidemic season, with five doses in the first season and six doses in the remaining season scheduled for administration. Patients were interviewed at every clinic visit for any side effects during the previous month, occurrence of any RSV infection and any hospital admission. Selection criteria included RSV vaccination and absence of RSV disease. Patients were excluded if they had RSV infection or a repaired cardiac lesion. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Compliance rate, hospital admission frequency and period of stay. SAMPLE SIZE: 530 during six seasons of RSV epidemics. RESULTS: Fourteen patients (2.6%) developed RSV infection and 13 (2.5%) required hospital admission, but only one patient (0.1%) needed intensive care admission. There were no deaths related to RSV infection; however 11 patients died due to causes unrelated to RSV infection. The average compliance rate was 97%. CONCLUSION: Palivizumab was well tolerated and effective in the prophylaxis of severe RSV infection in children with CHD. As in other studies of palivizumab prophylaxis, we observed a reduction in hospital admissions. LIMITATIONS: Retrospective design.

Standing literature on public health posits that one of the chief predictors of racial disparity in health outcomes is a lack of institutional trust among minority communities. Furthermore, in our own county-level analysis from the U.S., we find that counties with higher percentages of Black and Hispanic residents have had vastly higher cumulative deaths from COVID-19. In light of this standing literature and our own analysis, it is critical to better understand how to mitigate or prevent these unequal outcomes for any future pandemic or public health emergency. Therefore, we assess the claim that raising institutional trust, primarily scientific trust, is key to mitigating these racial inequities. Leveraging a new, pre-pandemic measure of scientific trust, we find that trust in science, unlike trust in politicians or the media, significantly raises support for COVID-19 social distancing policies across racial lines. Our findings suggest that increasing scientific trust is essential to garnering support for public health policies that lessen the severity of the current, and potentially a future, pandemic.","Kazemian, Sara; Fuller, Sam; Algara, Carlos",PLoS One,572,1

Much focus at the beginning of the UK's Covid-19 epidemic was directed to deficiencies in the national testing capacity. The quantity of tests may seem an important focus, but other characteristics are likely more germane. False positive tests are more probable than positive tests when the overall population has a low prevalence of the disease, even with highly accurate tests. Methods: We modify an SIR model to include quarantines states and test performance using publicly accessible estimates for the current situation. Three scenarios for cessation of lock-down measures are explored: (1) immediate end of lock-down measures, (2) continued lock-down with antibody testing based immunity passports, and (3) incremental relaxation of lock-down measures with active viral testing. Sensitivity, specifcity, prevalence and test capacity are modified for both active viral and antibody testing to determine their population level effect on the continuing epidemic. Findings: Diagnostic uncertainty can have a large effect on the epidemic dynamics of Covid-19 within the UK. The dynamics of the epidemic are more sensitive to test performance and targeting than test capacity. The quantity of tests is not a substitute for an effective strategy. Poorly targeted testing has the propensity to exacerbate the peak in infections. Interpretation: The assessment that 'no test is better than a bad test' is broadly supported by the present analysis. Antibody testing is unlikely to be a solution to the lock-down, regardless of test quality or capacity. A well designed active viral testing strategy combined with incremental relaxation of the lock-down measures is shown to be a potential strategy to restore some social activity whilst continuing to keep infections low.","Gray, Nicholas; Calleja, Dominic; Wimbush, Alex; Miralles-Dolz, Enrique; Gray, Ander; De-Angelis, Marco; Derrer-Merk, Elfride; Oparaji, Bright Uchenna; Stepanov, Vladimir; Clearkin, Louis; Ferson, Scott",,572,18

It is very important to control and cure this disease. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), chest computerized tomography (CT) imaging options are available as a significantly useful and more truthful tool to classify COVID-19 within the epidemic region. Most of the hospitals have CT imaging machines. It will be fruitful to utilize the chest CT images for early diagnosis and classification of COVID-19 patients. This requires a radiology expert and a good amount of time to classify the chest CT-based COVID-19 images especially when the disease is spreading at a rapid rate. During this pandemic COVID-19, there is a need for an efficient automated way to check for infection. CT is one of the best ways to detect infection inpatients. This paper introduces a new method for preprocessing and classifying COVID-19 positive and negative from CT scan images. The method which is being proposed uses the concept of empirical wavelet transformation for preprocessing, selecting the best components of the red, green, and blue channels of the image are trained on the proposed network.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the proportion of improper face mask use, the factors associated with face mask protection efficacy, and ways to improve efficacy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This population-based cross-sectional study was conducted in China from July to August 2020 in 5 kinds of public places. Participants included convenience samples of individuals wearing face masks and able to taste the check solution. EXPOSURES: Demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, including sex, age, and education level; information on face mask model and the worn duration was recorded. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome as airtightness, assessed by detecting face-to-face mask gaps, movement of cotton fiber placed at the face mask edges, and using a qualitative fit test with a bitter solution spray. Masks were further assessed for whether sealing the upper face mask edge with an adhesive tape strip was associated with improved face mask airtightness. RESULTS: Among 6003 face mask wearers enrolled, the mean (SD) age of participants was 31.1 (13.7) years, and 3047 participants (50.8%) were female. The first qualitative fit test found air leakage in 2754 participants (45.9%; 95% CI, 44.6%-47.1%), which was mostly attributable to gaps at the upper face mask edge. After sealing the upper face mask edge with an adhesive tape strip, 69.7% (95% CI, 68.0%-71.5%) of masks that had exhibited leakage became airtight in the second qualitative fit test, and the rate of airtightness reached 96.2% (95% CI, 95.4%-96.8%) in a third qualitative fit test after new surgical face masks with tape on the upper edge were provided to those who had not converted initially. The tape was well tolerated; overall, 6 participants (1.2%) reported a rash and 24 participants (5.8%) reported significant discomfort. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study of face mask fit among participants in China, although most people used face masks in public places, compromised protection due to suboptimal airtightness was common. The simple approach of sealing the upper edge of the face mask with an adhesive tape strip was associated with substantially improved its airtightness.","Pan, Xiangbin; Li, Xi; Kong, Pengxu; Wang, Lin; Deng, Rundi; Wen, Bin; Xiao, Luoxi; Song, Honglin; Sun, Yi; Zhou, Hongmei; Lu, Jiang; Wang, Yang; Guo, Qiuzhe; Duo, Lin; Sun, Chengye",JAMA Netw Open,572,20

The impact of vaccines on asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is largely unknown. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of consecutive, asymptomatic adult patients (n = 39,156) within a large United States healthcare system who underwent 48,333 pre-procedural SARS-CoV-2 molecular screening tests between December 17, 2020 and February 8, 2021. The primary exposure of interest was vaccination with at least one dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. The primary outcome was relative risk of a positive SARS-CoV-2 molecular test among those asymptomatic persons who had received at least one dose of vaccine, as compared to persons who had not received vaccine during the same time period. Relative risk was adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, patient residence relative to the hospital (local vs. non-local), healthcare system regions, and repeated screenings among patients using mixed effects log-binomial regression. RESULTS: Positive molecular tests in asymptomatic individuals were reported in 42 (1.4%) of 3,006 tests performed on vaccinated patients and 1,436 (3.2%) of 45,327 tests performed on unvaccinated patients (RR=0.44 95% CI: 0.33-0.60; p<.0001). Compared to unvaccinated patients, the risk of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was lower among those >10 days after 1 (st) dose (RR=0.21; 95% CI: 0.12-0.37; p<.0001) and >0 days after 2 (nd) dose (RR=0.20; 95% CI: 0.09-0.44; p<.0001) in the adjusted analysis. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 vaccination with an mRNA-based vaccine showed a significant association with a reduced risk of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection as measured during pre-procedural molecular screening. The results of this study demonstrate the impact of the vaccines on reduction in asymptomatic infections supplementing the randomized trial results on symptomatic patients.","Tande, Aaron J; Pollock, Benjamin D; Shah, Nilay D; Farrugia, Gianrico; Virk, Abinash; Swift, Melanie; Breeher, Laura; Binnicker, Matthew; Berbari, Elie F",Clin Infect Dis,572,9

As China emerges from the impact of COVID-19 on national economic and industrial activities, it has become the site of a large-scale natural experiment to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on regional air quality. However, ground measurements of fine particulate matters (PM(2.5)) concentrations do not offer comprehensive spatial coverage, especially in suburban and rural regions. In this study, we developed a machine learning method with satellite aerosol remote sensing data, meteorological fields and land use parameters as major predictor variables to estimate spatiotemporally resolved daily PM(2.5) concentrations in China. Our study period consists of a reference semester (1 November 2018–30 April 2019) and a pandemic semester (1 November 2019–30 April 2020), with six modeling months in each semester. Each period was then divided into subperiod 1 (November and December), subperiod 2 (January and February) and subperiod 3 (March and April). The reference semester model obtained a 10-fold cross-validated R(2) (RMSE) of 0.79 (17.55 μg/m(3)) and the pandemic semester model obtained a 10-fold cross-validated R(2) (RMSE) of 0.83 (13.48 μg/m(3)) for daily PM(2.5) predictions. Our prediction results showed high PM(2.5) concentrations in the North China Plain, Yangtze River Delta, Sichuan Basin and Xinjiang Autonomous Region during the reference semester. PM(2.5) levels were lowered by 4.8 μg/m(3) during the pandemic semester compared to the reference semester and PM(2.5) levels during subperiod 2 decreased most, by 18%.

However, there are gaps in health policy and advocacy education within graduate medical education. This study sought to characterise the impact of a virtual COVID-19 focused advocacy day among medical trainees in Massachusetts. STUDY DESIGN: The half-day event featured speakers drawn from government relations experts, physician advocates, and state and federal legislators as well as breakout discussions among attendees. A 25-question Redcap survey and list of resources/opportunities for continued advocacy was administered to all participants at event’s conclusion on 19 May 2020. RESULTS: There were 60 responses from 141 participants (43% response rate). One-third reported no prior formal health policy instruction, and over half reported getting information from news publications, social media and peers. 58% believed physician involvement in advocacy to be ‘extremely important’ prior to COVID-19; 83% believed the same after onset of COVID-19 (p<0.0001). The most common barriers to advocacy engagement were lack of time and knowledge. Most attendees felt participation increased their knowledge and likelihood to engage in the COVID-19 response, imparted useful skills/knowledge for continued advocacy, increased their interest in future similar events, and that such events should be available to all trainees. CONCLUSIONS: Trainees recognise the importance of health policy and advocacy and value opportunities to gain the necessary skills/knowledge to effect tangible change.

Objective: The objective of this study was to identify the types of aminopeptidase activities in human nasal mucosa. Methods: Human nasal mucosa was homogenized (n = 12), and cytoplasmic (S2) and membrane-rich (P2) fractions were obtained. Several aminopeptidase (Ap) activities were defined by (1) substrate specificity with leucine-enkephalin (leu-Ap) and alanine-nitroanilide (ala-Ap), (2) inhibitor studies with puromycin and bestatin, (3) enzyme activity histochemistry (zymography), (4) immunohistochemistry, and (5) gel electrophoresis. Human volunteers had methacholine, histamine, and allergen nasal provocations to determine the mechanisms controlling nasal aminopeptidase secretion in vivo. Results: P2 was the largest reservoir of puromycin-resistant aminopeptidase activity (630 pmol leu-enk/min/mg protein). S2 contained 32 pmol leu-enk/min/mg activity, with 80% representing puromycin-resistant activity and 20% puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase (PS-Ap). Ala-Ap was detected in both P2 and S2 fractions and was localized by zymography to epithelial and gland cells. Anti–rat brain–soluble PS-Ap IgG detected immunoreactive material in epithelium, glands, and endothelium. In nasal provocation studies, leu-AP correlated with glandular exocytosis but not vascular leak. Conclusions: The predominant aminopeptidase in human nasal epithelial and submucosal gland cells was membrane-bound puromycin-resistant aminopeptidase. A novel soluble puromycin-resistant aminopeptidase and lower amounts of soluble PS-Ap were also detected.

The purpose of this study was to compare the time variables for acute stroke treatment and evaluate differences in the pre-hospital and in-hospital care before and during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, as well as between the first and second waves. PATIENTS AND METHODS: : Observational and retrospective study from an Italian hospital, including patients who underwent thrombectomy between January 1st 2019 and December 31st 2020. RESULTS: : Out of a total of 594 patients, 301 were treated in 2019 and 293 in 2020. The majority observed in 2019 came from spoke centers (67,1%), while in 2020 more than half (52%, p<0.01) were evaluated at the hospital's emergency room directly (ER-NCGH).

Multinomial regression models assess the association between demographic and socio-economic characteristics with increases or decreases in six health behaviours: alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis use, junk food consumption, and TV and internet screen time. RESULTS: While findings varied across the six behaviours, overall, there was an increase in negative health behaviours: 14% of Canadian adults reported increasing their alcohol use (95% CI = 0.12, 0.15), 25% increased their junk food consumption (95% CI = 0.23, 0.27), and over 60% increased their screen time (62%, 95% CI = 0.60, 0.65 for TV and 66%, 95% CI = 0.63, 0.68 for internet). Younger and Canada-born adults were more likely to increase negative health behaviours than older and immigrant Canadians. Adults who reported financial impact of COVID-19 were more likely to increase all negative health behaviours (e.g., for increased junk food consumption, the relative risk ratio (RRR) = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.49, 2.20 relative to group reporting no impact). CONCLUSION: Our study documents the overall deterioration of health behaviours during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. To minimize long-term harm to the Canadian population’s health, the results highlight the need to tailor interventions, especially for younger Canadians, and the importance of mitigating financial impacts, which are linked to negative changes in health behaviours.

National testing initially focused on symptomatic care home residents, before extending to asymptomatic cohorts. AIM: The aim was to describe the epidemiology and transmission of COVID-19 in outbreak free care homes. METHODS: A two-point prevalence survey of COVID-19, in 34 Liverpool care homes, was performed in April and May 2020. Changes in prevalence were analysed. Associations between care home characteristics, reported infection, prevention and control interventions, and COVID-19 status were described and analysed. FINDINGS: No resident developed COVID-19 symptoms during the study. There was no significant difference between: the number of care homes containing at least one test positive resident between the first (17.6%, 95%CI 6.8-34.5) and second round (14.7%, 95%CI 5.0-31.1) of testing (p>0.99); and the number of residents testing positive between the first (2.1%, 95%CI 1.2-3.4) and second round (1.0%, 95%CI 0.5-2.1) of testing (p=0.11). Care homes providing nursing care (RR 7.99, 95%CI 1.1-57.3) and employing agency staff (RR 8.4, 95%CI 1.2-60.8) were more likely to contain test positive residents. Closing residents shared space was not associated with residents testing positive (RR 2.63, 95%CI 0.4-18.5). CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic COVID-19 care homes showed no evidence of disease transmission or development of outbreaks; suggesting that current infection prevention and control measures are effective in preventing transmission. Repeat testing at 2-3 weeks had limited or no public health benefits over regular daily monitoring of staff and residents for symptoms. These results should inform policies calling for regular testing of asymptomatic residents.","Green, R.; Tulloch, J.S.P.; Tunnah, C.; Coffey, E.; Lawrenson, K.; Fox, A.; Mason, J.; Barnett, R.; Constantine, A.; Shepherd, W.; Ashton, M.; Beadsworth, M.B.J.; Vivancos, R.; Hall, I.; Walker, N.; Ghebrehewet, S.",J Hosp Infect,572,15

The current study investigated if blocking Src was able to prevent steroid-associated osteoporosis (SAOP) in the same SAON animal model. Rabbits were treated with pulsed lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and corticosteroid methylprednisolone (MPS). At 2, 4, and 6 weeks after induction, Src siRNA, control siRNA and saline were intramedullary injected into proximal femur, respectively. Two fluorescent dyes xylenol orange and calcein green were injected before sacrificing the animals for in vivo labeling of the newly formed bone. At week 6 after induction, proximal femora of rabbits were dissected for micro-CT and histological analysis. Results showed significant bone loss in the metaphysis of femoral head in the control rabbits after SAON induction. Src siRNA treatment was able to prevent steroid-associate bone loss in trabecular bone and increase cortical bone thickness at femoral neck. Histomorphometry showed that Src siRNA increased the osteoblastic bone formation and decreased the eroded bone surfaces suggesting decreased osteoclastic bone resorption. This was the first study to report bone loss after SAON induction in rabbit model that could be prevented by knocking down Src by siRNA.","Zheng, Li-Zhen; Wang, Xin-Luan; Cao, Hui-Juan; Chen, Shi-Hui; Huang, Le; Qin, Ling",Bone,572,28

In most polycistronic viral mRNAs, initiation of translation of both the 5’-proximal, upstream cistron and the internal, downstream cistron(s) likewise occurs at an AUG codon. Animal viruses encoding polycistronic mRNAs in which translation-initiation occurs alternatively at one or more AUG initiation sites, include members of several virus families that utilize a variety of different replication strategies as parts of their life cycles. They include: 1. viruses with DNA genomes and viruses with RNA genomes; 2. viruses with circular genomes and viruses with linear genomes; 3. viruses whose genomes are constituted by a single piece of nucleic acid, as well as viruses with segmented genomes; and 4. viruses that utilize the cell nucleus as the site for mRNA biogenesis, as well as viruses whose mRNA is synthesized in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, many different biochemical mechanisms may exist in animal cells to permit the expression of functionally polycistronic viral mRNAs.","Samuel, Charles E.",Progress in Nucleic Acid Research and Molecular Biology,572,1

In China, Wuhan, Hubei Province was the epicenter. The disease is more severe in patients with high comorbidities and dialysis patients fall into this category. METHODS: In this report, we reviewed the whole course of the epidemic emerged in the HD center of Wuhan NO.1 Hospital by 28 February 2020. We compared the differences on the epidemiological characteristics and clinical features between patients surviving from COVID-19 and patients who died. RESULT: In this hospital, at time of the present report, 627 patients were on chronic hemodialysis and the prevalence of affected cases was 11.8% (74/627).The median age of the COVID-19-positive patients was 63 years (range 31–88), with an almost even gender distribution (females accounted for 54.4%).The most frequent presenting symptom was cough (41.9%), followed by fatigue (24.2%), fever (17.2%) and dyspnea (14.8%); 22.4% of the cases were and asymptomatic. Fourteen of the 74 patients died (19%), as for presenting symptoms, cough was more frequent in patients who died (P < 0.05). Surviving patients had higher levels of phosphate and albumin, and lower levels of C-reactive protein (CRP). Chest CT scan was positive in all cases, including in asymptomatic ones, and revealed in about three fourths of the cases bilateral (76.2%) lesions; in each lung lesions were multiple in about half of the cases of the cases (52.3%). After diagnosis, median time to death was 7 days in the 14 patients who died, with a range between 4 and 18 days. CONCLUSION: This preliminary, single Center study identifies hemodialysis patients as a population at high risk of severe, and deadly COVID-19 infection. While classic baseline clinical conditions, including age, kidney disease and gender, are not significantly associated with survival in COVID-19 infected hemodialysis, our study also suggests a significant association between risk of and death, poor nutritional status and less than optimal metabolic balance.","Min, Yonglong; Cheng, Li; Tu, Can; Li, Hongbo; He, Da; Huang, Dan; Chen, Dan; Huang, Xiaoli; Chen, Fang; Xiong, Fei",Int Urol Nephrol,572,23

Pharmacists in one-quarter of US states are able to prescribe hormonal contraception, a model known as pharmacy access. Pharmacy access became available in California in 2016 and Colorado in 2017. Objective To characterize how access to contraception products and services in pharmacies changed during the COVID-19 pandemic, including pharmacist prescribing practices and innovations in service delivery. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey among California and Colorado pharmacists from September to October 2020. Survey questions included pharmacist and pharmacy practice site characteristics, prescribing practices, pharmacist perspectives, and pharmacy services in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results A total of 128 pharmacists participated in the study with 38% (n=49) from California and 62% (n= 79) from Colorado. Among participants, 41% (n=53) prescribed contraception, of which 94% (n=50) continued, 4% (n=2) started, and 2% (n=1) suspended during the pandemic. Most participants reported interest (79%) and effort (75%) in prescribing contraception to be about the same during the pandemic. Community need for contraceptive services was perceived to be slightly or much higher (45%) or about the same (47%). Patient interest in pharmacy access was perceived to be slightly or much higher by 26% and about the same by 57%. When distributing contraception prescriptions, pharmacies increased curbside (from 12% to 52%), home delivery (from 40% to 60%), and mailing options (from 41% to 71%) during the pandemic. Conclusions Pharmacists prescribing hormonal contraception who participated in this study remained committed to providing this service during the pandemic. Some perceived increased community need for contraception and patient interest in direct pharmacy access. There was an increase in options for patients to receive contraception prescriptions with minimal contact.","Siddiqui, Nawal; Rafie, Sally; Bull, Shasta Tall; Mody, Sheila K.",J Am Pharm Assoc (2003),572,16

T-cell immunity to COVID-19 is mediated through differentiated CD4(+) T-cells and cytotoxic CD8(+) T-cells, although their differentiation is often atypical and ambiguous in COVID-19 and single cell dynamics of key genes need to be characterized. Notably, T-cells are dysregulated in severe COVID-19 patients, although their molecular features are still yet to be fully revealed. Importantly, it is not clear which T-cell activities are beneficial and protective and which ones can contribute to the development of severe COVID-19. In this article, we examine the latest evidence and discuss the key features of T-cell responses in COVID-19, showing how T-cells are dysregulated in severe COVID-19 patients. Particularly, we highlight the impairment of FOXP3 induction in CD4(+) T-cells and how the impaired FOXP3 expression can lead to the differentiation of abnormally activated (hyperactivated) T-cells and the dysregulated T-cell responses in severe patients. Furthermore, we characterise the feature of hyperactivated T-cells, showing their potential contribution to T-cell dysregulation and immune-mediated tissue destruction (immunopathology) in COVID-19.","Kalfaoglu, Bahire; Almeida-Santos, José; Tye, Chanidapa Adele; Satou, Yorifumi; Ono, Masahiro",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,572,32

However, little is known about public awareness and attitudes regarding COVID-19 in China. The impact of COVID-19 on the societal well-being and anxiety levels of the public has never been documented. The aim of this study was to survey the knowledge, attitudes, impact, and anxiety levels of the people of China in relation to the COVID-19 outbreak. Method: A cross-sectional population survey using an online questionnaire was undertaken between Jan 24 and Feb 24, 2020. The study participants were residents of mainland China over the age of 18 years. The attitude items in this study measured the perceived threat of COVID-19 based on the Health Belief Model. Anxiety was measured with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), a self-reported questionnaire that measure both state (STAI-S), and trait anxiety (STAI-T) Results: A total of 2,446 completed responses were received. The mean and standard deviation (SD) for the total knowledge score was 20.3 (SD ± 2.9) out of a possible score of 23. The social disruption and household economic impact were notable, particularly in provinces with higher cumulative confirmed cases. The majority of responses indicated a low perceived susceptibility of being infected (86.7% [95%CI 85.4–88.1]), with a fair proportion of respondents perceiving a higher severity (62.9% [95% CI 61.0–64.8]). The mean total impact score was 9.9 (SD ± 3.8) out of a possible score of 15. The mean score for STAI-S was 48.7 (SD ± 10.8), whereas the mean STAI-T score was 45.7 (SD ± 8.5). By demographics, women reported significantly higher odds for higher levels of both STAI-S (OR = 1.67) and STAI-T (OR = 1.30) compared to men. People of a younger age were also more likely to experience higher STAI-S and STAI-T. Higher perceived susceptibility and severity and impact were strong predictors of higher levels of STAI-S and STAI-T. Conclusion: Our findings can assist in tailoring public communication to change people's knowledge and attitudes. The present study also underlined the importance of the promotion of mental health during infectious disease outbreaks to help in moderating the perceived threat, social and household economic impact, targeting the vulnerable segment of the population.","Lin, Yulan; Hu, Zhijian; Alias, Haridah; Wong, Li Ping",Front Public Health,572,26

The aim of the present study is to evaluate the differences in cognitive and psychological sequelae of COVID-19 between younger and older adults, regardless of being admitted to the ICU or not. The study involved 299 recovered individuals (from 18 to 90 years old), who underwent a comprehensive cognitive and psychological assessment. Linear regression models were conducted separately for Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL) scores to investigate the effect of socio-demographic and clinical characteristics on them. Separate linear regression models were then applied sorting participants by age: younger adults (<65 years) and older adults (≥65 years). In the whole sample, PCL scores were predicted by the intensity of care received, by being intubated, and by the persistence of cough after 1 month after hospitalization. Only age had instead an effect on cognition. In younger adults, PCL scores were predicted by the presence of neurological symptoms, by the intensity of care received, and by being intubated; MoCA scores were only predicted by the intensity of care received. No significant associations were found in older adults. Psychological negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic particularly affect individuals under 65 years old, who also subjectively report cognitive sequelae associated with the infection.

Along with basic understanding of germ theory and sanitation, vaccination, over the past 50 years, has transformed lives and economies in both rich and poor countries by its direct impact on human and animal life—resulting in the eradication of small pox, huge reductions in the burden of previously common human and animal diseases such as polio, typhoid, measles in human medicine and contagious bovine pleuropneumonia, foot-and-mouth disease, screwworm and hog cholera and the verge of eradicating brucellosis, tuberculosis, and pseudorabies in veterinary medicine. In addition vaccination along with other animal production changes has provided the ability to produce otherwise unaffordable animal protein and animal health worldwide. The landscape however on which vaccinology was discovered and applied over the past 200 years, even in the past 10 years has and is undergoing continuous change. For vaccination as a public health tool to have its greatest impacts in human and veterinary medicine, these great medical sciences will have to come together, policy-relevant science for sustainable conservation in developing and developed countries needs to become the norm and address poverty (including lack of basic health care) in communities affected by conservation, and to consider costs and benefits (perceived or not) affecting the well-being of all stakeholders, from the local to the multinational. The need to return to and/or develop new education-based models for turning the tide from the heavily return-on-investment therapeutic era of the last century into one where the investment into the preventative sciences and medicine lead to sustainable cultural and cost-effective public health and economic changes of the future is never more evident than today. The new complex problems of the new millennium will require new educational models that train para- and professional people for thinking and solving complex inter-related biological, ecological, public-, political/economic problems.

However, their elicitation in vivo by vaccine immunogens based on the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) has not been successful. We have hypothesized that HIV-1 has evolved a strategy to reduce or eliminate the immunogenicity of the highly conserved epitopes of such antibodies by using “holes” (absence or very weak binding to these epitopes of germline antibodies that is not sufficient to initiate and/or maintain an efficient immune response) in the human germline B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire. To begin to test this hypothesis we have designed germline-like antibodies corresponding most closely to b12, 2G12 and 2F5 as well as to X5, m44 and m46 which are cross-reactive but with relatively weak neutralizing activity as natively occurring antibodies due to size and/or other effects. The germline-like X5, m44 and m46 bound with relatively high affinity to all tested Envs. In contrast, germline-like b12, 2G12 and 2F5 lacked measurable binding to Envs in an ELISA assay although the corresponding mature antibodies did. These results provide initial evidence that Env structures containing conserved vulnerable epitopes may not initiate humoral responses by binding to germline antibodies. Even if such responses are initiated by very weak binding undetectable in our assay it is likely that they will be outcompeted by responses to structures containing the epitopes of X5, m44, m46, and other antibodies that bind germline BCRs with much higher affinity/avidity. This hypothesis, if further supported by data, could contribute to our understanding of how HIV-1 evades immune responses and offer new concepts for design of effective vaccine immunogens.","Xiao, Xiaodong; Chen, Weizao; Feng, Yang; Zhu, Zhongyu; Prabakaran, Ponraj; Wang, Yanping; Zhang, Mei-Yun; Longo, Nancy S.; Dimitrov, Dimiter S.",Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications,572,16

Hence we can predict not only whether a putative enzyme in a newly sequenced organism has the potential to perform a certain reaction, but how the reaction is performed, using which cofactors and with susceptibility to which drugs or inhibitors, details with important consequences for drug and enzyme design. Work that predicts enzyme catalytic activity based on 3D protein structure features limits the prediction of mechanism to proteins already having either a solved structure or a close relative suitable for homology modelling. RESULTS: In this study, we evaluate whether sequence identity, InterPro or Catalytic Site Atlas sequence signatures provide enough information for bulk prediction of enzyme mechanism. By splitting MACiE (Mechanism, Annotation and Classification in Enzymes database) mechanism labels to a finer granularity, which includes the role of the protein chain in the overall enzyme complex, the method can predict at 96% accuracy (and 96% micro-averaged precision, 99.9% macro-averaged recall) the MACiE mechanism definitions of 248 proteins available in the MACiE, EzCatDb (Database of Enzyme Catalytic Mechanisms) and SFLD (Structure Function Linkage Database) databases using an off-the-shelf K-Nearest Neighbours multi-label algorithm. CONCLUSION: We find that InterPro signatures are critical for accurate prediction of enzyme mechanism. We also find that incorporating Catalytic Site Atlas attributes does not seem to provide additional accuracy.

Western regions will eventually transition to the Prevalence Equilibrium stage, in which the accelerating prevalence levels off as the IBD population ages and possibly as a result of an unexpected rise in mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mitigating the global burden of IBD will require concerted efforts in disease prevention and health-care delivery innovations that respond to changing demographics of the global IBD population.

In total, 10 targets and 12 bioactive molecules have been predicted. Among the most promising molecules we identified Triacsin C, which inhibits ACSL3, and which has been shown to be very effective against different viruses, including positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses. Similarly, we also identified the drug Celgosivir, which has been successfully tested in cells infected with different types of viruses such as Dengue, Zika, Hepatitis C and Influenza. Finally, other drugs targeting enzymes of lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism or protein palmitoylation (such as Propylthiouracil, 2-Bromopalmitate, Lipofermata, Tunicamycin, Benzyl Isothiocyanate, Tipifarnib and Lonafarnib) are also proposed.","Santos-Beneit, Fernando; Raškevičius, Vytautas; Skeberdis, Vytenis A.; Bordel, Sergio",Sci Rep,572,16

There is an opportunity to complement these trials with investigation of angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) because an ARB (losartan) was effective in murine influenza pneumonia. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Our innovative design includes: ARBs; alignment with the WHO Ordinal Scale (primary endpoint) to align with other COVID-19 trials; joint longitudinal analysis; and predictive biomarkers (angiotensins I, 1–7, II and ACE1 and ACE2). Our hypothesis is: ARBs decrease the need for hospitalisation, severity (need for ventilation, vasopressors, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or renal replacement therapy) or mortality of hospitalised COVID-19 infected adults. Our two-pronged multicentre pragmatic observational cohort study examines safety and effectiveness of ARBs in (1) hospitalised adult patients with COVID-19 and (2) out-patients already on or not on ARBs. The primary outcome will be evaluated by ordinal logistic regression and main secondary outcomes by both joint longitudinal modelling analyses. We will compare rates of hospitalisation of ARB-exposed versus not ARB-exposed patients. We will also determine whether continuing ARBs or not decreases the primary outcome. Based on published COVID-19 cohorts, assuming 15% of patients are ARB-exposed, a total sample size of 497 patients can detect a proportional OR of 0.5 (alpha=0.05, 80% power) comparing WHO scale of ARB-exposed versus non-ARB-exposed patients.

The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) entry process into susceptible host tissue cells is complex requiring (1) attachment of the virus via the conserved spike (S) protein receptor-binding motif (RBM) to the host cell angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, (2) S protein proteolytic processing, and (3) membrane fusion. Spike protein processing occurs at two cleavage sites, i.e., S(1)/S(2) and S(2)′. Cleavage at the S(1)/S(2) and S(2)′ sites ultimately gives rise to generation of competent fusion elements important in the merging of the host cell and viral membranes. Following cleavage, shedding of the S(1) crown results in significant conformational changes and fusion peptide repositioning for target membrane insertion and fusion. Identification of specific protease involvement has been difficult due to the many cell types used and studied. However, it appears that S protein proteolytic cleavage is dependent on (1) furin and (2) serine protease transmembrane protease serine 2 proteases acting in tandem. Although at present not clear, increased SARS-CoV-2 S receptor-binding motif binding affinity and replication efficiency may in part account for observed differences in infectivity. Cleavage of the ACE2 receptor appears to be yet another layer of complexity in addition to forfeiture and/or alteration of ACE2 function which plays an important role in cardiovascular and immune function.","Chambers, James P.; Yu, Jieh; Valdes, James J.; Arulanandam, Bernard P.",J Pathog,572,28

Thus, the measurement of loneliness is of paramount importance. The Three-Item Loneliness Scale (TILS) was designed to be used in large-population surveys as a quick measure of loneliness. The aim of this study is to provide a Spanish validation of the TILS. A representative sample of the Spanish population (N = 1951) was used. We analysed the psychometric properties, factor structure, and distribution demographics characteristics of the Spanish TILS. Analyses showed differences regarding age, gender, educational level, employment status, household composition and annual gross income in line with previous literature. The confirmatory factor analysis revealed a unifactorial structure, with significant moderate correlations between the TILS and depression, anxiety, paranoia and well-being, and mild significant correlations with belongingness and mistrust. The internal consistency of the Spanish TILS was good (α = 0.82). Our study indicates that the TILS is a valid and reliable measure of loneliness in the Spanish population. Loneliness is a modern epidemic and a precursor of mental and health problems that reduced the quality of life. Therefore, it is important to have reliable measures of this phenomenon.","Trucharte, A.; Calderón, L.; Cerezo, E.; Contreras, A.; Peinado, V.; Valiente, C.",Curr Psychol,572,24

Goals of implementation were to consolidate in-person prenatal screening, surveillance, and examinations into fewer in-person visits while maintaining patient access to ongoing antenatal care and subspecialty consultations via telehealth virtual visits. The rationale for this change was to minimize patient travel and thus risk for COVID-19 exposure. Because a large portion of obstetric patients had underlying medical or fetal conditions placing them at increased risk for adverse outcomes, prenatal care telehealth regimens were tailored for increased surveillance and/or counseling. Based on the incorporation of telehealth into prenatal care for high-risk patients, specific recommendations are made for the following conditions, clinical scenarios, and services: (1) hypertensive disorders of pregnancy including preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, and chronic hypertension; (2) pregestational and gestational diabetes mellitus; (3) maternal cardiovascular disease; (4) maternal neurologic conditions; (5) history of preterm birth and poor obstetrical history including prior stillbirth; (6) fetal conditions such as intrauterine growth restriction, congenital anomalies, and multiple gestations including monochorionic placentation; (7) genetic counseling; (8) mental health services; (9) obstetric anesthesia consultations; and (10) postpartum care. While telehealth virtual visits do not fully replace in-person encounters during prenatal care, they do offer a means of reducing potential patient and provider exposure to COVID-19 while providing consolidated in-person testing and services. Key Points: Telehealth for prenatal care is feasible. Telehealth may reduce coronavirus exposure during prenatal care. Telehealth should be tailored for high risk prenatal patients.","Aziz, Aleha; Zork, Noelia; Aubey, Janice J.; Baptiste, Caitlin D.; D'Alton, Mary E.; Emeruwa, Ukachi N.; Fuchs, Karin M.; Goffman, Dena; Gyamfi-Bannerman, Cynthia; Haythe, Jennifer H.; LaSala, Anita P.; Madden, Nigel; Miller, Eliza C.; Miller, Russell S.; Monk, Catherine; Moroz, Leslie; Ona, Samsiya; Ring, Laurence E.; Sheen, Jean-Ju; Spiegel, Erica S.; Simpson, Lynn L.; Yates, Hope S.; Friedman, Alexander M.",Am J Perinatol,572,1

All infected piglets developed severe diarrhea 18–24 hours after oral inoculation. Jejunum from infected animals, as compared with control jejunum, had decreased mucosal-to-serosal, serosal-to-mucosal, and net Na+ and Cl− fluxes. Clonidine and verapamil caused a decrease in short-circuit current and stimulation of Na+ and Cl− absorption in control jejunum. In infected piglets, although the jejunum exhibited severe villus atrophy, both drugs stimulated Na+ and Cl− absorption and the magnitude of Na+ and Cl− absorption was similar in control and transmissible-gastroenteritis-infected jejunum. In contrast, d-glucose stimulated Na+ absorption, and the decrease in shortcircuit current caused by verapamil and clonidine, were decreased in transmissible-gastroenteritis-infected jejunum. Such pharmacological stimulation of Na+ and Cl− absorption might be useful in the management and treatment of certain viral diarrheal diseases.","Homaidan, Fadia R.; Torres, Alfonso; Donowitz, Mark; Sharp, Geoffrey W.G.",Gastroenterology,572,24

In the UK, appendicectomy is the most common treatment with non-operative management unusual. Due to concerns about the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission during surgical procedures, surgeons were advised to consider non-operative treatment and avoid laparoscopy where possible. This study aims to report management and outcomes, to date, of children with appendicitis in the UK and Ireland during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Survey of consultant surgeons who treat children with appendicitis that informed a prospective multicentre observational cohort study. SETTING: Data were collected from centres in the UK and Ireland for cases admitted between 1 April and 31 May 2020 (first 2 months of the COVID-19 pandemic) at both general surgical and specialist paediatric surgical centres. PARTICIPANTS: The study cohort includes 838 children with a clinical and/or radiological diagnosis of acute appendicitis of which 527 (63%) were male. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURED: Primary outcome was treatment strategy used for acute appendicitis. Other outcomes reported include change in treatment strategy over time, use of diagnostic imaging and important patient outcomes to 30 days following hospital admission. RESULTS: From very early in the pandemic surgeons experienced a change in their management of children with appendicitis and almost all surgeons who responded to the survey anticipated further changes during the pandemic. Overall, 326/838 (39%) were initially treated non-operatively of whom 81/326 (25%) proceeded to appendicectomy within the initial hospital admission. Of cases treated initially surgically 243/512 (48%) were performed laparoscopically. Diagnostic imaging was used in 445/838 (53%) children. Cases treated non-operatively had a shorter hospital stay than those treated surgically but hospital readmissions within 30 days were similar between groups. In cases treated surgically the negative appendicectomy rate was 4.5%. There was a trend towards increased use of surgical treatment and from open to laparoscopic appendicectomy as the pandemic progressed. CONCLUSION: Non-operative treatment of appendicitis has been widely used for the first time in children in the UK and Ireland and is safe and effective in selected patients. Overall patient outcomes do not appear to have been adversely impacted by change in management during the pandemic thus far.","Bethell, George S; Rees, Clare M; Sutcliffe, Jonathan R; Hall, Nigel J",BMJ Paediatr Open,572,14

The age-old passive immunization with protective antibodies to neutralize the virus is one of the strategies for emergency prophylaxis and therapy for COVID-19. In this review, we discuss the up-to-date advances in immune-based therapy for COVID-19. The use of convalescent plasma therapy as the first line of defences to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection has been established with encouraging results. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that bind to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein or blocking the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor have been found very promising as the countermeasure to tackle the SARS-CoV-2 infection, though clinical trials are underway. Considering the counterproductive antibody-dependent enhancement of the virus, the mAbs therapy that is safe and efficacious even in people with an underlying condition will be a significant breakthrough. The emerging immunotherapeutic interventions using nanobodies and cellular immunotherapy are also the promising avenues to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. We also discuss the implication of mAbs against mediators of cytokine storm syndrome to modify the immune response of COVID-19 patients, thus reducing the fatality rate of COVID-19 infection.","Sajna, Kuttuvan Valappil; Kamat, Siya",Cytotherapy,572,24

We evaluated the association between three social determinants of health and delirium occurrence and duration in critically ill adults. DESIGN: Secondary, subgroup analysis of a cohort study. SETTING: Single, 36-bed mixed medical-surgical ICU in the Netherlands. PATIENTS: Nine hundred fifty-six adults consecutively admitted from July 2016 to February 2020. Patients admitted after elective surgery, residing in a nursing home, or not expected to survive greater than or equal to 48 hours were excluded. INTERVENTION: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Four factors related to three Center for Disease Control social determinants of health domains (social/community context [ethnicity], education access/quality [educational level], and economic stability [employment status and monthly income]) were collected at ICU admission from patients (or families). Well-trained ICU nurses evaluated patients without coma (Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale, –4, –5) and with the Confusion Assessment Method-ICU and/or a delirium day was defined by greater than or equal to 1 + Confusion Assessment Method-ICU and/or scheduled antipsychotic use. Multivariable logistic regression models controlling for ICU days and 10 delirium risk variables (before-ICU: age, Charlson, cognitive impairment, any antidepressant, antipsychotic, or benzodiazepine use; ICU baseline: Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation IV and admission type; daily ICU: Sequential Organ Failure Assessment, restraint use, coma, benzodiazepine, or opioid use) evaluated associations between each social determinant of health factor and both ICU delirium occurrence and duration. Delirium occurred in 393/956 patients (45.4%) for 2 days (1–5 d). Patients with low (vs high) income had more ICU delirium (p = 0.05). Multivariate analyses revealed no social determinants of health to be significantly associated with increased delirium occurrence or duration. Low (vs high) income was weakly associated with increased delirium occurrence (adjusted odds ratio, 1.83; 95% CI, 0.91–3.89). Low (vs high) education (adjusted relative risk, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.97–1.53) was weakly associated with a longer delirium duration. CONCLUSIONS: Social determinants of health did not affect ICU delirium in one Dutch region. Additional research across different countries/regions and where additional social determinants of health are considered is needed to define the association between social determinants of health and ICU delirium.","Wu, Ting-Ting; Zegers, Marieke; Kooken, Rens; Griffith, John L.; Molnar, Beth E.; Devlin, John W.; van den Boogaard, Mark",Crit Care Explor,572,2

Influenza vaccine effectiveness (IVE) estimates, however, are often discordant and a source of confusion for decision makers. IVE assessments are increasingly publicized and are often used by policy makers to make decisions about the value of seasonal influenza vaccination. But there is limited guidance on how IVE should be interpreted or used to inform policy. There are several limitations to the use of IVE for decision‐making: (a) IVE studies have methodological issues that often complicate the interpretation of their value; and (b) the full impact of vaccination will almost always be greater than the impact assessed by a point estimate of IVE in specific populations or settings. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of study methodologies and the fundamental limitations of IVE estimates is important for the accuracy of interpretations and support of policy makers’ decisions. Here, we review a comprehensive set of issues that need to be considered when interpreting IVE and determining the full benefits of influenza vaccination. We propose that published IVE values should be assessed using an evaluative framework that includes influenza‐specific outcomes, types of VE study design, and confounders, among other factors. Better interpretation of IVE will improve the broader assessment of the value of influenza vaccination and ultimately optimize the public health benefits in seasonal influenza vaccination.","Hollingsworth, Rosalind; El Guerche‐Séblain, Clotilde; Tsai, Theodore; Vasiliev, Yuri; Lee, Sam; Bright, Helen; Barbosa, Paula",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,572,20

Infection of SARS-CoV-2 to the host cell is characterized by direct translation of positive single stranded (+ ss) RNA to form large polyprotein polymerase 1ab (pp1ab), which acts as precursor for a number of nonstructural and structural proteins that play vital roles in replication of viral genome and biosynthesis of new virus particles. The maintenance of viral protein homeostasis is essential for continuation of viral life cycle in the host cell. To test whether the protein homeostasis of SARS-CoV-2 can be disrupted by inducing specific protein aggregation, we made an effort to examine whether the viral proteome contains any aggregation prone regions (APRs) that can be explored for inducing toxic protein aggregation specifically in viral proteins and without affecting the host cell. This curiosity leads to the identification of several (> 70) potential APRs in SARS-CoV-2 proteome. The length of the APRs ranges from 5 to 25 amino acid residues. Nearly 70% of total APRs investigated are relatively smaller and found to be in the range of 5–10 amino acids. The maximum number of ARPs (> 50) was observed in pp1ab. On the other hand, the structural proteins such as, spike (S), nucleoprotein (N), membrane (M) and envelope (E) proteins also possess APRs in their primary structures which altogether constitute 30% of the total APRs identified. Our findings may provide new windows of opportunities to design specific peptide-based, anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic molecules against COVID-19.","Gour, Shalini; Yadav, Jay Kant",J Proteins Proteom,572,24

Judicious resource allocation is paramount but difficult due to the unpredictable disease course. Once hospitalized, discerning which patients may progress to critical disease would be valuable for resource planning. Medical records were reviewed for consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in a large healthcare system in Texas. The main outcome was progression to critical disease within 10 days from admission. Albumin trends from admission to 7 days were analyzed using mixed-effects models, and progression to critical disease was modeled by multivariable logistic regression of laboratory results. Risk models were evaluated in an independent group. Of 153 non-critical patients, 28 (18%) progressed to critical disease. The rate of decrease in mean baseline-corrected (Δ) albumin was −0.08 g/dL/day (95% CI −0.11 to −0.04; p<0.001) or four times faster, in those who progressed compared with those who did not progress. A model of Δ albumin combined with lymphocyte percentage predicting progression to critical disease was validated in 60 separate patients (sensitivity, 0.70; specificity, 0.74). ALLY (delta albumin and lymphocyte percentage) is a simple tool to identify patients with COVID-19 at higher risk of disease progression when: (1) a 0.9 g/dL or greater albumin drop from baseline within 5 days of admission or (2) baseline lymphocyte of ≤10% is observed. The ALLY tool identified >70% of hospitalized cases that progressed to critical COVID-19 disease. We recommend prospectively tracking albumin. This is a globally applicable tool for all healthcare systems.","van Zyl, Johanna S; Alam, Amit; Felius, Joost; Youssef, Ronnie M; Bhakta, Dipesh; Jack, Christina; Jamil, Aayla K; Hall, Shelley A; Klintmalm, Göran B; Spak, Cedric W; Gottlieb, Robert L",J Investig Med,572,15

However, in cases of contagious diseases such as the flu, social contacts also pose a health risk. According to prominent health behavior change theories, perceiving a risk for one’s health motivates precautionary behaviors. The “behavioral immune system” approach suggests that social distancing might be triggered as a precautionary, evolutionarily learned behavior to prevent transmitting contagious diseases through social contact. This study examines the link between personal risk perception for an infectious disease and precautionary behavior for disease-prevention in the context of social relationships. METHODS: At 2-week intervals during the first semester, 100 Psychology freshmen indicated their flu risk perception, whether they had been ill during the previous week, and their friendships within their freshmen network for eight time points. RESULTS: Social network analysis revealed that participants who reported a high flu risk perception listed fewer friends (B = −0.10, OR = 0.91, p = 0.026), and were more likely to be ill at the next measuring point (B = 0.26, OR = 1.30, p = 0.005). Incoming friendship nominations increased the likelihood of illness (B = 0.14, OR = 1.15, p = 0.008), while the reduced number of friendship nominations only marginally decreased this likelihood (B = −0.07, OR = 0.93, p = 0.052). CONCLUSION: In accordance with the concept of a “behavioral immune system,” participants with high flu risk perception displayed a social precautionary distancing even when in an environment, in which the behavior was ineffective to prevent an illness.","Giese, Helge; Gamp, Martina; Stok, F.

One well-known complication of COVID-19 in severe cases is acute kidney injury, but no research has given a description of its impact on the kidney in patients with mild symptoms. We explore the renal function changes in mild COVID-19 patients. This retrospective, single-center study included 27 participants with laboratory-detected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus two (SARS-CoV-2) infection who were admitted to the Tri-Service General Hospital from 4 February to 26 May 2020 and analyzed their clinical features, radiological findings, and laboratory data. Data collected upon admission and discharge showed a median estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 106.7 mL/min/1.732 m(2) and 112.2 mL/min/1.732 m(2), respectively, with a p-value of 0.044. A correlation between renal function and the severity of infection was also found and was statistically significant upon admission. Patients with a lower lymphocyte count or higher C-reactive protein, neutrophil count, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio presented with a decreased eGFR during their early infection phase. The biomarkers (CRP and NLR) may be linked with dynamic changes of renal function in COVID-19 patients who are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms.","Chang, Ya-Chieh; Tsai, Ping-Huang; Chou, Yu-Ching; Lu, Kuo-Cheng; Chang, Feng-Yee; Wu, Chia-Chao",J Pers Med,572,28

However, the contribution of antimicrobial resistance to the manifestation of bacterial infections in these patients has yet to be elucidated. MethodsWe collected 70 Gram-negative bacterial strains, isolated from the lower respiratory tract of ventilated COVID-19 patients in Zurich, Switzerland between March and May 2020. Species identification was performed using MALDI-TOF; antibiotic susceptibility profiles were determined by EUCAST disk diffusion and CLSI broth microdilution assays. Selected Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were analyzed by whole-genome sequencing. ResultsP. aeruginosa (46%) and Enterobacterales (36%) comprised the two largest etiologic groups. Drug resistance in P. aeruginosa isolates was high for piperacillin/tazobactam (65.6%), cefepime (56.3%), ceftazidime (46.9%) and meropenem (50.0%). Enterobacterales isolates showed slightly lower levels of resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam (32%), ceftriaxone (32%), and ceftazidime (36%). All P. aeruginosa isolates and 92% of Enterobacterales isolates were susceptible to aminoglycosides, with apramycin found to provide best-in-class coverage. Genotypic analysis of consecutive P. aeruginosa isolates in one patient revealed a frameshift mutation in the transcriptional regulator nalC that coincided with a phenotypic shift in susceptibility to {beta}-lactams and quinolones. ConclusionsConsiderable levels of antimicrobial resistance may have contributed to the manifestation of bacterial superinfections in ventilated COVID-19 patients, and may in some cases mandate consecutive adaptation of antibiotic therapy. High susceptibility to amikacin and apramycin suggests that aminoglycosides may remain an effective second-line treatment of ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia, provided efficacious drug exposure in lungs can be achieved.","Gysin, Marina; Acevedo, Claudio Tirso; Haldimann, Klara; Bodendoerfer, Elias; Imkamp, Frank; Bulut, Karl; Buehler, Philipp Karl; Brugger, Silvio Daniel; Becker, Katja; Hobbie, Sven N.",,572,28

Despite worldwide efforts to contain viral spread, the outbreak has not been stopped yet. Among healthcare personnel, dentists seem to be at elevated risk of exposure to COVID-19. This risk is even more serious in pediatric dentistry, since affected children, frequently, present an asymptomatic, mild or moderate clinical viral infection and, therefore, they may play a major role in community-based COVID-19 transmission. To date, despite no universal guidelines are available for dental procedures in pediatric dentistry during COVID-19 outbreak, routine dental practice should be postponed and only severe dental emergencies must be treated. In the case of a dental emergency, involving a pediatric patient, dentists should be aware of which recommended management protocol can be adopted during the practice to protect patient health, to safeguard their-self and to prevent viral transmission. The aim of this paper is to provide clinical recommendations, presenting a needed tool for dentists to allow a valid and safe how-to-do protocol.

Durant le premier confinement pour COVID-19 les dispositifs de signalement des VPI/VIF préexistants ont été renforcés, de nouveaux ont été créés et ont enregistré une augmentation des signalements de 32 % dès le début du confinement avec des disparités régionales. Aucune étude, à notre connaissance, n’a mesuré l’accessibilité de ces dispositifs en population générale, et ce qu’elle en connaît, que ce soit pendant le confinement ou en dehors. L’objectif est de déterminer la proportion de la population française féminine qui a connaissance de ces dispositifs et qui a pu en avoir recours durant le premier confinement. Méthodes Analyse secondaire d’une étude observationnelle par questionnaire anonyme (diffusé via réseaux sociaux, Ordres professionnels, associations d’aide aux victimes, réseaux de périnatalité, Protection maternelle et infantile) conduite du 19/05/20 au 10/07/20 auprès des femmes de plus de 15 ans résidentes en France. Etaient recueillis, les caractéristiques sociodémographiques, l’existence des types de VPI selon l’OMS (psychologiques, physiques/sexuelles, cyberviolence, coercition sexuelle) et VIF, leur fréquence avant confinement, leurs évolutions pendant, la connaissance des principaux dispositifs de signalement pour violences et leurs recours (numéro 3919, Alerte pharmacie, SMS 114). Les analyses bivariées des variables qualitatives ont été réalisées à l’aide du logiciel R.3.5.1. L’analyse multivariée est en cours. L’étude a été déclarée à la CNIL. Résultats Au total, 722/1211 femmes incluses (59,6 %) déclaraient subir au moins un type de VPI/VIF avant confinement qui a perduré pendant pour 89,8 % (648/722). L’âge moyen était de 34,1 ans (±10,4). Durant le confinement les VPI psychologiques, cyberviolence et VIF avaient diminué (respectivement 92 % versus 85,3 %, p <0,001 ; 13,6 % versus 8,2 %, p <0,01 ; 13,7 % versus 4,4 %, p <0,001) alors que les VPI physiques/sexuelles et la coercition sexuelle étaient stables (respectivement 12,5 % versus 11,6 %, p =0,58 ; 11,3 % versus 8,6 %, p =0,10). 10/722 (1,4 %) avaient déclaré des coupures/hématomes, 2/722 (0,3 %) des entorses/brûlures/luxations, 2/722 (0,3 %) une hospitalisation. 16/489 (3,3 %) non-victimes avant confinement avaient subi des violences de tous types pendant. Les trois dispositifs étaient aussi méconnus des victimes avant confinement que des non-victimes : plateforme 3919 (34,3 % versus 31,9 %, p =0,38), Alerte pharmacie (44,5 % versus 41,3 %, p =0,28), SMS 114 (55,1 % versus 54 %, p =0,54) ; 0,6 % versus 0,4 % (p >0,99), 1,9 % versus 2,5 % (p =0,54) et 2,4 % versus 1,6 % (p =0,39) avaient découvert le 3919, l’Alerte pharmacie et le SMS 114 après le déconfinement. Une femme sur 722 avait appelé elle-même le 3919., 15/722 (2,1 %), 6/722 (0,8 %) et 7/722 (1 %) n’avaient pas pu signaler les violences au 3919, dans une pharmacie ou par SMS ; 19/722 (2,6 %) par peur des représailles, 4/722 (0,6 %) empêchées par leur conjoint/entourage.

However, there is a paucity of data regarding the effect of obesity on young adult patients with COVID-19. We sought to identify whether adverse outcomes are associated with obesity, particularly in COVID-19 patients 45 years and younger. METHODS: This was a two-center, retrospective cohort study that included 210 patients. Eligible patients were between the ages of 18–45 years old, had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction via nasopharyngeal swab, and were not pregnant. Primary outcomes were defined as follows: 1) in-hospital mortality during the study period; 2) need for mechanical ventilation; and 3) admission to the hospital. We analyzed baseline characteristics of the cohort using descriptive statistics. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated to assess associations between outcomes and obesity, defined as body mass index (BMI) >30. RESULTS: Of those patients who tested positive, 18 died during hospitalization (9%), 36 (17%) required mechanical ventilation, and 94 (45%) were admitted. Each of the primary outcomes was significantly associated with a BMI >30 (mortality OR = 6.29, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.76–22.46, p = 0.0046; mechanical ventilation OR = 6.01, 95% CI, 2.5–14.48, p = 0.0001; admission OR 2.61, 95% CI, 1.49–4.58, p =.0008). CONCLUSION: Obesity appears to be an independent risk factor for poor outcomes in young patients with COVID-19. Future studies examining the clinical characteristics and risk factors of COVID-19 patients across large, diverse populations will strengthen our understanding of this novel and complex disease.","Steinberg, Eric; Wright, Ellsworth; Kushner, Beth",West J Emerg Med,572,15

In such a crucial situation, it is very important to predict infected cases to support prevention of the disease and aid in the preparation of healthcare service. India is fighting efficiently against COVID-19 and facing greater challenges because of its large population and high population density. Though the government of India is taking all needful steps to prevent its spread but it is not enough to control and stop spread of the disease so far, perhaps due to defiant nature of people living in India.

Community groups, voluntary groups, local authorities, and faith groups have responded to this concern by developing and delivering holiday programmes that enable children from low-income families to take part in activities and access food. The current study used purposive sampling to investigate children’s and young people’s views of holiday provision, from across three holiday clubs, in Northern Ireland. Both primary school children (n = 34; aged 4–11) and secondary school children (n = 31; aged 12–17) showed high levels of awareness of poverty and food insecurity and associated pressures and stresses on households. Importantly, children and young people did not feel stigmatised about attending holiday provision, suggesting a positive and inclusive culture towards holiday club attendance. Children reported that they enjoyed the range of activities provided at holiday clubs and reported that attendance improved their self-confidence, especially for some older children, who acted as peer mentors to younger attendees, helped them to develop new skills, and provided them with opportunities to socialise with peers in a safe environment, out with their normal social groupings in school. Older children showed a high level of shrewdness and knowledge of sectarian divides in communities but spoke positively about how different religious or cultural backgrounds did not matter in terms of meeting and making new friends in holiday club settings. In terms of food provision, the findings of this study suggest that further work needs to be done to support children to access and eat healthy, nutritious food.","Shinwell, Jackie; Finlay, Ellen; Allen, Caitlin; Defeyter, Margaret Anne",Int J Environ Res Public Health,572,0

Hypothesis We hypothesize that a more targeted set of interventions focusing on preventing severe COVID-19, rather than SARS-2-CoV transmission, would be less disruptive to society. To identify these, it would be helpful to better understand how the infecting dose of SARS-CoV-2 and its route of infection and influence clinical outcome, immunological protection and likelihood of onward transmission. Proposal We suggest that carefully controlled human infection model (CHIM) studies involving intranasal and oral administration of progressively increasing doses of SARS-CoV-2, starting with low levels, to healthy young adult volunteers may be the most expeditious and definitive way to answer these questions. Such studies would differ in objective from CHIM proposals designed to expedite vaccine development, although the latter might be adapted to address some of the questions raised here. Implications Results from the studies proposed here could help elucidate the relationship of infection to COVID-19 and thereby provide a scientific basis for more targeted and sustainable application of public health control measures, and inform the design of improved immunotherapeutics and more targeted vaccine development.","Hausdorff, William P.; Flores, Jorge",Int J Infect Dis,572,20

Here, we proved that three cysteines within the motif, but not dependent on position, are minimally required for the survival of the recombinant mouse hepatitis virus. When the carboxy termini with these mutated motifs of S proteins were respectively introduced into a heterogeneous protein, both incorporation into lipid rafts and S-palmitoylation of these recombinant proteins showed a similar quantity requirement to cysteine residues. Meanwhile, the redistribution of these proteins on cellular surface indicated that the absence of the positively charged rather than cysteine residues in the motif might lead the dramatic reduction in syncytial formation of some mutants with the deleted motifs. These results suggest that multiple cysteine as well as charged residues concurrently improves the membrane-associated functions of S protein in viral replication and cytopathogenesis.","Yang, Jinhua; Lv, Jun; Wang, Yuyan; Gao, Shuang; Yao, Qianqian; Qu, Di; Ye, Rong",Virology,572,16

This study evaluates the risk of hospitalization and mortality among patients with hypertension and COVID-19 in a large US integrated healthcare system. METHODS: Patients with hypertension and COVID-19 (between March 1- September 1, 2020) on ACEIs or ARBs were compared with patients on other frequently used antihypertensive medications. RESULTS: Among 14,129 patients with hypertension and COVID-19 infection (mean age 60 years, 48% men, 58% Hispanic), 21% were admitted to the hospital within 30 days of COVID-19 infection. Of the hospitalized patients, 24% were admitted to intensive care units, 17% required mechanical ventilation, and 10% died within 30 days of COVID-19 infection. Exposure to ACEIs or ARBs prior to COVID-19 infection was not associated with an increased risk of hospitalization or all-cause mortality (rate ratios for ACEIs vs other antihypertensive medications ​= ​0.98, 95% CI: 0.88, 1.08; ARBs vs others ​= ​1.00, 95% CI: 0.90, 1.11) after applying inverse probability of treatment weights. These associations were consistent across racial/ethnic groups. Use of ACEIs or ARBs during hospitalization was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality (odds ratios for ACEIs or ARBs vs others ​= ​0.50, 95% CI: 0.34, 0.72).

The aim of this study was to create such a platform and investigate whether performance evaluation of BLS trainings would be more objective compared to conventional Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) examinations if these evaluations were carried out with the platform which combines OSCE scoring criteria with sensor data retrieved from the simulator’s sensors. METHODS: Participants were 25 volunteers (11 men [44.0%] and 14 [56.0] women) among Acıbadem Mehmet Ali Aydınlar University students without prior knowledge of the BLS protocol.

Data retrieved from the sensors of the manikin enable educators to evaluate learners in a more objective way. Performance data retrieved from the serious gaming module have been combined with the results of the hands-on module. Data acquired from the hands-on module have also been compared with the results of conventional OSCE scores of the participants, which were obtained by watching the videos of the same trainings. RESULTS: Participants were considered successful in the game if they scored 80/100 or above. Overall, participants scored 80 or above in an average of 1.4 (SD 0.65) trials. The average BLS serious game score was 88.3/100 (SD 5.17) and hands-on average score was 70.7/100 (SD 17.3), whereas the OSCE average score was 84.4/100 (SD 12.9). There was no statistically significant correlation between success on trials (score ≥80/100), serious game, hands-on training app, and OSCE scores (Spearman rho test, P>.05). The mean BLS serious game score of the participants was 88.3/100 (SD 5.17), whereas their mean hands-on training app score was 70.7/100 (SD 17.3) and OSCE score was 84.4/100 (SD 12.9). CONCLUSIONS: Although scoring criteria for OSCE and hands-on training app were identical, OSCE scores were 17% higher than hands-on training app scores. After analyzing the difference of scores between hands-on training app and OSCE, it has been revealed that these differences originate from scoring parameters such as compression depth, compression frequency, and ventilation volume. These data suggest that evaluation of BLS trainings would be more objective if these evaluations were carried out with the modality, which combines visual OSCE scoring criteria with sensor data retrieved from the simulator’s sensors.

Nine polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and three nitro-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (NPAHs) were detected by high-performance liquid chromatography with a fluorescence detector. The average concentrations of ∑PAHs and ∑NPAHs differed significantly both temporally and spatially and were the lowest in Kirishima during the warm period (∑PAHs: 0.11 ± 0.06 ng m-3; ∑NPAHs: 1.23 ± 0.96 pg m-3) and the highest in Shenyang during the cold period (∑PAHs: 49.7 ± 21.8 ng m-3; ∑NPAHs: 357 ± 180 pg m-3). The average total benzo[a]pyrene-equivalent concentrations were also higher in Shenyang and Vladivostok than in Japanese cities. According to the results of source apportionment, traffic emissions impacted these cities in both the warm and cold periods, whereas coal combustion-generated effects were obvious in Shenyang and Vladivostok during the cold period. Furthermore, PAHs and NPAHs originating from the Asian continent, including Shenyang and Vladivostok, exerted some influence on Japanese cities, especially in the cold period. Compared to Japanese cities and Vladivostok, yearly variations in ∑PAHs and 1-nitropyrene in Shenyang showed that their concentrations were considerably lower than those reported in past studies, indicating the positive effects of air pollutant control policies in China. These results not only describe the current characteristics and yearly variations of PAHs and NPAHs in typical urban cities in East Asia but also, more importantly, reveal that the effects of the East Asian monsoon play an important role in the analysis of atmospheric behaviours of PAHs and NPAHs. Furthermore, this study supports the role of multinational cooperation to promote air pollution control in East Asia.","Yang, Lu; Zhang, Lulu; Chen, Lijiang; Han, Chong; Akutagawa, Tomoko; Endo, Osamu; Yamauchi, Masahito; Neroda, Andrey; Toriba, Akira; Tang, Ning",Environmental pollution,572,20

The divergent coping mechanisms that the family members use aim to lower the negative, psychological and emotional impact of the stress. These include: escape, avoidance and denial. AIM: To explore, describe and contextualise coping mechanisms used by the families of MHCUs and to suggest recommendations for improving their coping mechanisms in Mahikeng sub-district, North West province (NWP), South Africa. SETTING: The study was conducted in three community health centres in Mahikeng sub-district, NWP, South Africa. METHODS: A qualitative-exploratory-descriptive and contextual research design was used. Non-probability convenience and purposive sampling techniques were used to select participants. WhatsApp video calls were used to collect data which were analysed following Creswell’s six steps of qualitative data analysis. RESULTS: The study established three themes namely; challenges experienced by the family members, coping mechanism used by the family members, and suggestions for improvement in the coping mechanisms for the family members. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study show that the family members of MHCUs are faced with different challenges. Some of the coping mechanisms used by the family members are insufficient and require improvement to enable them to cope effectively. When the coping mechanisms of the family members of MHCUs are improved, their well-being and that of the MHCUs might improve significantly. CONTRIBUTION: The findings of this study provides information that may be used to improve the coping mechanisms of the families of MHCUs in the NWP, South Africa.","Modise, Tshepang P.; Mokgaola, Isaac O.; Sehularo, Leepile A.",Health SA,572,20

The aim of this study was to investigate the pathogenesis of this new virus in human beings. METHODS: We obtained ex-vivo cultures of the human bronchus, lung, nasopharynx, and tonsil and in-vitro cultures of primary human alveolar epithelial cells and peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages. We compared virus tropism and induction of proinflammatory cytokine responses of two human influenza A H7N9 virus isolates, A/Shanghai/1/2013 and A/Shanghai/2/2013; a highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus; the highly pathogenic avian influenza H7N7 virus that infected human beings in the Netherlands in 2003; the 2009 pandemic influenza H1N1 virus, and a low pathogenic duck H7N9 virus that was genetically different to the human disease causing A H7N9 viruses. FINDINGS: Both human H7N9 viruses replicated efficiently in human bronchus and lung ex-vivo cultures, whereas duck/H7N9 virus failed to replicate in either. Both human A H7N9 viruses infected both ciliated and non-ciliated human bronchial epithelial cells and replicated to higher titres than did H5N1 (p<0·0001 to 0·0046) and A/Shanghai/1/2013 replicated to higher titres than did H7N7 (p=0·0002–0·01). Both human A H7N9 viruses predominantly infected type II alveolar epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages in the human lung and replicated to higher titres than did H5N1 (p<0·0001 to 0·0078); A/Shanghai/1/2013 replicated to higher titres than did H1N1 (p=0·0052–0·05) and H7N7 (p=0·0031–0·0151). Human H7N9 viruses were less potent inducers of proinflammatory cytokines compared with H5N1 virus. INTERPRETATION: Collectively, the results suggest that the novel H7N9 viruses are better adapted to infect and replicate in the human conducting and lower airways than are other avian influenza viruses, including H5N1, and pose an important pandemic threat.

The emergence of viral variants complicates disease control. The IBV strains in Taiwan were clustered into two groups, Taiwan group I and Taiwan group II, based on the S1 gene. A variant was previously identified and showed a distinct S1 gene homology with other local strains. This study investigated the 3′ 7.3 kb genome of eight Taiwan strains isolated from 1992 to 2007. The genes of interest were directly sequenced. Sequence analyses were performed to detect any recombination event among IBVs. The results demonstrated that all of the examined viruses maintained the typical IBV genome organization as 5′-S-3a-3b-E-M-5a-5b-N-UTR-3′. In the phylogenetic analyses, various genes from one strain were clustered into separate groups. Moreover, frequent recombination events were identified in the Simplot analyses among the Taiwan and China CK/CH/LDL/97I-type strains. Putative crossover sites were located in the S1, S2, 3b, M genes and the intergenic region between the M and 5a genes. All of the recombinants showed chimeric IBV genome arrangements originated from Taiwan and China-like parental strains.

Although the method may be affected by classification errors, its simplicity will allow to reduce the error of the estimates by increasing the sample size, since it requires minimal laboratory testing capabilities. We illustrate our methodology with data from Mexico and estimate the CFR in 0.34 \%, that is, we estimate that the total number of infections is about $300$ times larger than the number of deaths.

Japan experienced the outbreak of COVID-19, and the State of Emergency was declared during April 2020 and May 2020. The aim of the present study was to clarify the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on a comprehensive stroke center in Japan. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke admitted in our institute between December 2019 and July 2020. The patients who underwent reperfusion therapy (intravenous thrombolysis and/or mechanical thrombectomy) were divided into the pre-COVID-19 period (December 2019 to March 2020) and the With-COVID-19 period (April 2020 to July 2020). Study outcomes were the number of stroke admissions in our institute, workflow time metrics, the frequency of modified Rankin Scale score 0–2 at discharge, and brain imaging modalities before reperfusion therapy in patients who underwent reperfusion therapy. Results: In our institute, the number of stroke admissions decreased during the State of Emergency and then increased after the lifting of the State of Emergency. Among patients who underwent reperfusion therapy (median age, 77 years; female 27%; median baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, 10), times from hospital arrival to imaging [25 (21–33) min vs. 30 (25–38) min, P = 0.03] and to thrombolysis [38 (31–52) min vs. 51 (37–64) min, P = 0.03] were prolonged compared with the pre-COVID-19 period. There was no significant difference in the frequency of modified Rankin Scale score 0–2 at discharge between the two periods (32 vs. 45%, P = 0.21).

The present study aimed to investigate the association of liver stiffness measurement (LSM) with disease severity and clinical course of COVID‐19. METHODS: We prospectively recruited consecutive hospitalised adult patients with COVID‐19 in a 3‐month period. Demographic, laboratory, clinical and vibration‐controlled transient elastography (VCTE) features were recorded at entry, and all patients were prospectively followed‐up. Severe liver fibrosis was defined as an LSM value higher than 9.6 kPA. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to reveal factors associated with disease severity and outcomes. RESULTS: Out of 98 eligible patients with COVID‐19, 12 (12.2%) had severe liver fibrosis. Patients with severe liver fibrosis had higher baseline disease severity (P = .022), more commonly required oxygen treatment at entry (P = .010), and had intensive‐care unit (ICU) requirements during the 6 (1‐39)‐day median follow‐up time (P = .017). The presence of severe liver fibrosis was independently associated with disease severity (odds ratio (OR): 7.685, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.435‐41.162, P = .017) and ICU requirement (OR: 46.656, 95% CI: 2.144‐1015.090, P = .014). LSM was correlated with alanine aminotransferase levels (P = .005, r: 0.283), but not with other markers of acute hepatic injury or inflammation.

In the USA, two highly protective mRNA vaccines are available: BNT162b2 from Pfizer/BioNTech and mRNA-1273 from Moderna (3, 4). These vaccines induce antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein, including neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) predominantly directed against the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) (1–4). Serum NAbs are induced at modest levels within ~1 week of the first dose, but their titers are strongly boosted by a second dose at 3 (BNT162b2) or 4 weeks (mRNA-1273) (3, 4). SARS-CoV-2 is most commonly transmitted nasally or orally and infects cells in the mucosae of the respiratory and to some extent also the gastrointestinal tract (5). Although serum NAbs may be a correlate of protection against COVID-19, mucosal antibodies might directly prevent or limit virus acquisition by the nasal, oral and conjunctival routes (5). Whether the mRNA vaccines induce mucosal immunity has not been studied. Here, we report that antibodies to the S-protein and its RBD are present in saliva samples from mRNA-vaccinated healthcare workers (HCW). Within 1–2 weeks after their second dose, 37/37 and 8/8 recipients of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, respectively, had S-protein IgG antibodies in their saliva, while IgA was detected in a substantial proportion.

METHODS: This study was conducted as a retrospective, case series investigation. Patients whose eyes were receiving intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment for CRVO-ME, with the next follow-up visit occurring more than 6 months following treatment were identified. Baseline disease characteristics (at the last visit before being LTFU), cause and duration of treatment interruption, and the resulting disease progression, complications, and outcomes were assessed. Baseline characteristics predictive of visual outcome were also analyzed. RESULTS: This study included a total of 17 eyes of 17 patients. The mean duration of being LTFU was 7.8 ± 2.1 months. On the return visit after being LTFU, 7 of 17 eyes (41.2%) developed neovascular complications. Despite treatment, 12 eyes (70.1%) lost ≥3 best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) lines, with 2 eyes (11.8%) developing a final BCVA of hand motion or more severe. At the final visit, the mean logarithm of minimal angle of resolution (logMAR) BCVA deteriorated significantly compared to before being LTFU (P < 0.001). The increasing duration of being LTFU is associated with a deterioration of visual acuity prognosis. CONCLUSION: In CRVO-ME patients who are receiving anti-VEGF therapy, unintentional treatment interruptions can cause visually disastrous consequences, including irreversible blindness. Patients who were LTFU for a long period should be strongly warned about their poor visual prognosis.","Yang, Kai-Bo; Liu, Lei; Feng, Hao; Li, Jun; Liu, Zhe-Li; Liu, He-Nan; Zhang, Han",Ther Clin Risk Manag,572,1

Using national data from over a million U.S. respondents to a Facebook-Carnegie Mellon University survey administered from September 2020 to March 2021, we estimated the likelihoods of frontline workers, compared to non-frontline workers, 1) to ever test positive for SARs-Cov-2 and 2) to test positive for SARs-Cov-2 within the past two weeks. Net of other covariates including education level, county-level political environment, and rural residence, both healthcare and non-healthcare frontline workers had higher odds of having ever tested positive for SARs-Cov-2 across the study time period. Similarly, non-healthcare frontline workers were more likely to test positive in the previous 14 days. Conversely, healthcare frontline workers were less likely to have recently tested positive. Our findings suggest that occupational exposure has played an independent role in the uneven spread of the virus. In particular, non-healthcare frontline workers have experienced sustained higher risk of testing positive for SARs-Cov-2 compared to non-frontline workers. Alongside more worker protections, future COVID-19 and other highly infectious disease response strategies must be augmented by a more robust recognition of the role that structural factors, such as the highly stratified U.S. occupational landscape, have played in the uneven toll of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Do, D.

Relief measures instituted by World Bank Group (WBG) and International Monetary Fund (IMF) to help in the prevention, detection and treatment of coronavirus amidst SSA non-monetary measures and business support interventions are highlighted. The underlying economic challenges likely to impede WBG and IMF relief measures in SSA such as health infrastructure and resource deficiency, unsustainable high debt levels and drought effects due to climate change are analysed. Ranking the inadequate doctor-to-population ratio from 2015 to 2017, SSA ratio stood at less than 1 per 1000 population recommended World Health Organisation standard. On the credit front, other creditors such as China have contributed to prevailing economic challenges as China Official Development Assistance (ODA) to SSA debt ratio is depicted at 55% in 2016 from a low ratio of 17% in 2009. The economic challenges are further buttressed by estimated monthly tourism sector loss of US$8.8 billion per month for SSA countries during the pandemic. SSA self-employed informal sector that accounts for 76% (International Labour Organisation 2018) is equally affected amid lockdowns, business losses, closures and job losses. Economic growth is forecasted to drop to 1.8%, from a previous estimate of 3.2% according to United Nations Economic Commission (2020) due to a trade fall with developed and emerging markets. Recovery is aligned to good resilience in inherent cyber risk, oil intensity and urbanisation rate and policies to enhance production and the agriculture sector.","Ndiili, Nchimunya",Environ Syst Decis,572,28

The presented rapid digital PCR system simultaneously detects two specific targets (ORF1ab and N genes) and one reference gene (RNase P) with a single PCR thermal cycling period around 7 s and the total running time less than 5 min. A clear positive signal could be identified within 115 s via the rapid digital RT-PCR, suggesting its efficiency for the end-point detection. In addition, benchmark tests with serial diluted reference samples of SARS-CoV-2 RNA reveal the excellent accuracy of our system (R(2)>0.99). More importantly, the rapid digital PCR system gives consistent and accurate detection of low-concentration reference samples, whereas qPCR yields Ct values with significant variations that could lead to false-negative results. Finally, we apply the rapid digital PCR system to analyze clinical samples with both positive and control cases, where results are consistent with qPCR test outcomes. By providing similar accuracy with qPCR while minimizing the detection time-consuming and the false-negative tendency, the presented rapid digital PCR system represents a promising improvement on the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19.","Yin, Hao; Wu, Zhenhua; Shi, Nan; Qi, Yong; Jian, Xiaoyu; Zhou, Lin; Tong, Yigang; Cheng, Zule; Zhao, Jianlong; Mao, Hongju",Biosens Bioelectron,572,1

DESIGN: Proof of Concept model. SETTING: Northwell Health; a 23 Hospital, 40 ICU (500 ICU beds) healthcare organization serving the downstate NY area. During the initial coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, Northwell Health rapidly expanded to greater than 1,000 ICU beds. The surge in patients required redeployment of noncritical care providers to the ICU bedside. The Tele-ICU program expanded from covering 176 beds pre pandemic to assisting with care for patients in approximately 450 beds via deployment of Wi-Fi-enabled mobile telehealth carts to the newly formed ICUs. PATIENTS: Critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 patients hospitalized at Northwell Health, NY, at any point from March 2020 to June 2020. INTERVENTIONS: To offset the shortage of critical care physicians, Northwell Health established a collaboration with the Tele-ICU program of Providence, St. Joseph Health in the state of Washington, which enabled the critical care physicians of Providence, St. Joseph Health to participate in virtual rounding on critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 patients at Northwell Health. MAIN RESULTS: We developed an innovative hybrid model that allowed for virtual rounding on an additional 40–60 patients per day by a remote critical care physician at Providence, St. Joseph Health. This was accomplished in approximately 3 weeks and provided remote care to complex patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate the proof of concept of establishing a network of connected Tele-ICU programs as a rapidly scalable and sustainable paradigm for the provision of support from critical care physicians for noncritical care teams at the bedside.","Chandra, Saurabh; Hertz, Craig; Khurana, Hargobind; Doerfler, Martin E.",Crit Care Explor,572,1

To date, measurement of this distress has largely been by means of validated assessment tools. We believe that qualitative data may provide a richer view of staff experiences during this pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, observational study using online and written questionnaires to all ICU staff which consisted of validated tools to measure psychological distress (quantitative findings) and open-ended questions with free-text boxes (qualitative findings). Here, we report our qualitative findings. We asked four questions to explore causes of stress, need for supports and barriers to accessing supports. A conventional content analysis was undertaken. RESULTS: In total, 269 of the 408 respondents (65.9%) gave at least one response to a free-text question. Seven overarching themes were found, which contribute to our proposed model for occupational stress amongst critical care staff. The work environment played an important role in influencing the perceived psychological impact on healthcare workers. Extra-organisational factors, which we termed the “home-work interface” and uncertainty about the future, manifested as anticipatory anxiety, had a proportionally larger influence on worker well-being than would be expected in non-pandemic conditions. CONCLUSION: Our findings have important implications for appropriate allocation of resources and ensuring well-being of the ICU multidisciplinary team for this and future pandemics.","Feeley, T.; ffrench-O’Carroll, R.; Tan, M.

METHODS Online survey to collect epidemiological data and apply the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). Eight weeks later, the researchers requested the same requirements to complete the BAI and IES-R and compare the results. RESULTS The sample of 287 answered the first and second questionnaires, being 72.8% women, with a median age of 22 years. In the first interview, the median BAI was 12 (7-19) and the median IES-R was 27.0 (15-40); in the second, the median BAI was 11 (6-22) and the IES-R was 30 (15-41) with p<00001 and 0.09, respectively. Anxiety levels were worse in females (p<0.0001 for both BAI and IES-R) and in those who worked/studied in the area of health (p=0.001 for BAI and 0.01 for IES-R). There was a negative correlation between age and anxiety (p<0.0001 for BAI and IES-R). CONCLUSIONS A high prevalence of anxiety that lowered after 8 weeks were found.

Recommendations are in place to limit medical personnel attending to the neurosurgical patient as a protective measure and to conserve personal protective equipment. However, the complexity of the neurosurgical patient proves to be a challenge and an opportunity for innovation. The goal of our study was to determine if telemedicine delivered through smart glasses was feasible and effective in an alternative method of conducting ward round on neurocritical care patients during the pandemic. Methods A random pair of Neurosurgery resident and specialist conducted consecutive virtual and physical ward rounds on neurocritical patients. A virtual ward round was first conducted remotely by a specialist who received real-time audiovisual information from a resident wearing smart glasses integrated with telemedicine. Subsequently, a physical ward round was performed together by the resident and specialist on the same patient. The management plans of both ward rounds were compared and the intrarater reliability was measured. On study completion a qualitative survey was performed. Results Ten paired ward rounds were performed on 103 neurocritical care patients with excellent overall intrarater reliability. Nine out of ten showed good to excellent internal consistency and one showed acceptable internal consistency. Qualitative analysis indicated wide user acceptance and high satisfaction rate with the alternative method. Conclusions Virtual ward rounds using telemedicine via smart glasses on neurosurgical patients in critical care were feasible, effective and widely accepted as an alternative to physical ward rounds during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Munusamy, Thangaraj; Karuppiah, Ravindran; Faizal A Bahuri, Nor; Sockalingam, Sutharshan; Cham, Chun Yoong; Waran, Vicknes",World Neurosurg,572,3

METHODS: A review of primary data sources in the US was conducted. The data were summarized to describe national and state-level trends in the spread of COVID-19 and in policy and technology solutions. RESULTS: COVID-19 cases and deaths initially peaked in late March and April, but after a brief reduction in June cases and deaths began rising again July and continued to climb into early August. The US policy response is best characterized by its federalist, decentralized nature. The national government has led in terms of economic and fiscal response, increasing funding for scientific research into testing, treatment, and vaccines, and in creating more favorable regulations for the use of telemedicine. State governments have been responsible for many of the containment, testing, and treatment responses, often with little federal government support. Policies that favor economic re-opening are often followed by increases in state-level case numbers, which are then followed by stricter containment measures, such as mask wearing or pausing re-opening plans. CONCLUSIONS: While all US states have begun to “re-open” economic activities, this trend appears to be largely driven by social tensions and economic motivations than an ability to effectively test and surveil populations.","Bergquist, Savannah; Otten, Thomas; Sarich, Nick",Health Policy Technol,572,16

Emission changes reduce tropospheric hydroxyl radical and ozone burdens, increasing methane lifetime. Reduced SO(2) emissions and oxidizing capacity lead to a decrease in sulfate aerosol and increase in aerosol size, with accompanying reductions to cloud droplet concentration. However, large reductions in black carbon emissions increase aerosol albedo. Overall, the changes in ozone and aerosol direct effects (neglecting aerosol‐cloud interactions which were statistically insignificant but whose response warrants future investigation) yield a radiative forcing of −33 to −78 mWm(−2). Upon cessation of emission reductions, the short‐lived climate forcers rapidly return to pre‐COVID levels; meaning, these changes are unlikely to have lasting impacts on climate assuming emissions return to pre‐intervention levels.","Weber, James; Shin, Youngsub M.; Staunton Sykes, John; Archer‐Nicholls, Scott; Abraham, N.

In Africa, the shortage of oxygen is even more severe and needs equipment that is simpler to use than a ventilator. Different models of generating oxygen locally at hospitals, including at provincial and district levels, are required. In some countries, hospitals have established small oxygen production plants to supply themselves and neighbouring hospitals.

The SARS-CoV-2 causes a spectrum of diseases mainly affecting the respiratory system. It can also complicate other systems causing thromboembolic phenomena and myocardial ischaemia. An entity of hypoxia has been described in these patients which show no clinical signs and symptoms of respiratory distress despite being extremely hypoxic. This is called silent or happy hypoxia. The exact mechanism for this is not known. We report 4 cases which had similar presentations of silent hypoxia but had different course of illness and different outcomes. All 4 patients did not show any signs of respiratory distress, but had oxygen saturation less than 82%. 3 of them needed intensive care unit support for oxygen therapy and subsequently needed noninvasive ventilation. Only one required invasive ventilation. The fourth patient did not require intensive care support. The patient who required invasive ventilation succumbed due to severe COVID pneumonia whereas the other 3 patients were discharged from the hospital. Silent hypoxemia can go undetected in COVID-19 patients particularly in the time of a pandemic.

However, the rate of AKI in patients of different severities and independent predictive factors associated with AKI are not well understood. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We enrolled 107 severely or critically ill elderly patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in Wuhan, China. AKI was defined according to the 2012 KDIGO criteria. We explored the association between AKI and in-hospital mortality using logistic regression. A predictive nomogram was formulated to predict the AKI development of patients with COVID-19 based on multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 107 elderly patients were enrolled during the study period. The mean age was 70 (64–78) years, and 69 (64.5%) were men. For the 107 patients, the degree of severity of COVID-19 was categorized as 37 patients with the severe type (34.6%) and 70 patients with the critical type (65.4%). Overall, 48 of the 107 patients (44.9%) developed AKI during their hospitalization, while AKI occurred in 7 (18.9%) out of the 37 severe patients and 41 (44.9%) out of the 70 critical patients. Of the AKI patients, 35.4% (17/48) required continuous renal replacement therapy, including 14.3% of AKI patients in severe cases and 39.0% of AKI patients in critical cases. Kaplan–Meier analysis demonstrated that patients with AKI had a significantly higher risk for in-hospital mortality than severely and critically ill patients without AKI. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that AKI (OR = 33.74; 95% CI = 3.34–341.29; P = 0.003), septic shock (OR = 15.58; 95% CI = 2.08–116.78; P = 0.008), invasive mechanical ventilation (OR = 18.44; 95% CI = 2.35–144.69; P = 0.006), and oxygenation index (OR = 0.99; 95% CI = 0.98–1.000; P = 0.014) were independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality. A nomogram was established based on the multivariate analysis results. The C-index for the developed AKI model was 0.935 (95% CI, 0.892–0.978); when 10-fold cross validation was used to validate the model, the corrected C-index was 0.825. CONCLUSION: AKI is common among COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU and is recognized as a marker of disease severity. The proposed nomogram accurately predicted AKI development in ICU patients with COVID-19 based on individual characteristics. Therefore, the strategy for kidney protection against severe or critical pneumonia is appropriate.","Li, Qinglin; Zhang, Tianyi; Li, Fei; Mao, Zhi; Kang, Hongjun; Tao, Ling; Zhou, Feihu; Cai, Yue",Clin Interv Aging,572,6

The outbreak of COVID-19 as Public Health Emergency of International Concern is declared by World Health Organization on January 30, 2020. The known route of transmission is due to direct contact or via respiratory droplets. Recently, several studies reported SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) in wastewater treatment plant samples. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater may predict COVID-19 occurrence qualitatively and quantitatively. The concept is known as wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) or sewage epidemiology. The present study reviewed the presence of coronavirus in wastewater and investigations relating to WBE development as a tool to detect COVID-19 community transmission. Few articles reported a correlation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration in wastewater with the number of COVID-19 cases, whereas few reported higher prediction by wastewater surveillance than confirmed cases. The application of WBE is still in a preliminary stage but has the potential to indicate an early sign of transmission. The knowledge of persistence of coronavirus in municipal and hospital wastewater is needed for the application of WBE and to understand the chances of transmission.

METHODS: Nasopharyngeal specimens from 100 HCPs were collected from Huntsville Hospital (Huntsville, AL) during the winter and from 100 HCPs during the summer. All subjects were tested for 22 viruses and 19 bacteria using Target Enriched Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction. Both seasonal cohorts were composed of students, nurses, physicians, and residents. RESULTS: Of the 100 HCPs tested during the winter, 34 subjects were colonized with at least 1 bacterium, and 11 tested positive for at least 1 virus. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Moraxella catarrhalis, and coronavirus were the most frequently detected potentially infectious agents. Of the 100 HCPs tested during the summer, 37 tested positive for at least 1 bacterium, and 4 tested positive for a viral agent. The most prevalent bacteria were MRSA and Klebsiella pneumonia. CONCLUSION: Nasopharyngeal carriage among asymptomatic HCPs was common, but the frequency and presence of potential pathogens varied with each season. Understanding the colonization and infection potential of upper respiratory organisms is important, particularly for viruses. Although asymptomatic HCPs certainly harbor a number of different potentially infectious agents, future studies are needed to determine whether colonized pathogens are transmitted or initiate infection in at-risk patient populations.","Hassoun, Ali; Huff, Matthew D.; Weisman, David; Chahal, Khushdeep; Asis, Esmeralda; Stalons, Don; Grigorenko, Elena; Green, Jessica; Malone, Leslie L.; Clemmons, Scott; Lu, Stanley",Am J Infect Control,572,17

We sought to use Google Trends (GT) to investigate whether there was a surge in individuals searching for information related to smell loss during the COVID‐19 epidemic in the Italy, Spain, UK, USA, Germany, France, Iran and Netherlands. METHODS: GT was used to explore Internet activity related to loss of smell in Italy, Spain, UK, USA, Germany, France, Iran and Netherlands. Spearman rank analysis was performed to correlate loss of smell relative search volumes (RSV) with the increases of daily confirmed cases of COVID‐19 and deaths attributed to disease. As a control event, we also performed analysis of smell‐related searches during the last UK Influenza epidemic of 2009. RESULTS: In all three countries, we observed strong correlations between daily RSVs related to loss of smell, increases of daily COVID‐19+ cases and deaths ranging from 0.633 to 0.952. All correlations were statistically significant (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: There is a strong correlation between the frequency of searches for smell‐related information and the onset of COVID‐19 infection in Italy, Spain, UK, USA, Germany, France, Iran and Netherlands. We would hypothesise this may relate to a previously under‐recognised symptom. This article is protected by copyright.

We project (age-specific) alcohol-attributable mortality up to 2060 in 26 European countries, after a careful assessment of past trends. For this purpose we used population-level country-, sex-, age- (20–84) and year-specific (1990–2016) alcohol-attributable mortality fractions (AAMF) from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study, which we adjusted at older ages. To these data we apply an advanced age-period-cohort projection methodology, that avoids unrealistic future differences and crossovers between sexes and countries. We project that in the future, AAMF levels will decline in all countries, and will converge across countries and sexes. For 2060, projected AAMF are, on average, 5.1% among men and 1.4% among women, whereas in 2016 these levels were 10.1% and 3.3%, respectively. For men, AAMF is projected to be higher in Eastern and South-western Europe than in North-western Europe. All in all, the share of mortality due to alcohol is projected to eventually decline in all 26 European countries. Achieving these projected declines will, however, require strong ongoing public health action, particularly for selected Eastern and North-western European countries.","Janssen, Fanny; El Gewily, Shady; Bardoutsos, Anastasios; Trias-Llimós, Sergi",Int J Environ Res Public Health,572,1

Many related clinical studies, such as clinical trials, have been published, but to the knowledge of the authors, there has been no bibliometric analysis of these publications focusing on clinical research studies on COVID-19. Methods: Global publications on COVID-19 from January 2020 to December 2020 were extracted from the Web of Science (WOS) collection database. The VOSviewer software and CiteSpace were employed to perform a bibliometric study. In addition, we obtained information on relevant clinical trials from the website http://clinicaltrials.gov. Results: China published most of the articles in this field and had the highest number of citations and H-index. The Journal of Medical Virology published most of the articles related to COVID-19. In terms of institutions, Huazhong University of Science and Technology had the most publications, and Wang, JW received the highest number of citations. Conclusion: The diagnosis, prevention, and prognosis of COVID-19 are still the focus of attention at present.

In short time intervals, however, nucleotide substitutions are ineffective to record all complexities of virus population dynamics. In this sense, the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic poses a challenge for evolutionary analysis. We used computer simulation to evolve populations in scenarios of varying temporal intervals to evaluate the impact of the age of an epidemic on estimates of time and geography. Before estimating virus timescales, the shape of tree topologies can be used as a proxy to assess the effectiveness of the virus phylogeny in providing accurate estimates of evolutionary parameters. In short timescales, estimates have larger uncertainty. We compared the predictions from simulations with empirical data. The tree shape of SARS-CoV-2 was closer to shorter timescales scenarios, which yielded parametric estimates with larger uncertainty, suggesting that estimates from these datasets should be evaluated cautiously. To increase the accuracy of the estimates of virus transmission times between populations, the uncertainties associated with the age estimates of both the crown and stem nodes should be communicated. We place the age of the common ancestor of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in late September 2019, corroborating an earlier emergence of the virus.","Schrago, Carlos G.; Barzilai, Lucia P.",Genet Mol Biol,572,20

In this study, we described, according to seasons, ages and clinical units, the results obtained in children (<15 years old) by multiplex-PCR (mPCR) tests allowing a quick and wide range detection of all respiratory viruses. These results were also compared with RSV specific detection. METHODS: All nasopharyngeal mPCR and RSV tests requested by clinicians in our French teaching hospitals group between 2011 and 2014 were retrospectively included. All repeated samples for the same children in the same month were discarded. RESULTS: Of the 381 mPCR tests (344 children) performed, 51.4% were positive. Positivity and viral co-infection rates were higher in the 6–36 months old strata (81% and 25%, p<0.0001 and p = 0.04, respectively). Viral distribution showed strong variations across ages. During specific influenza epidemic periods, only 1/39 (2.5%) mPCR tests were positive for influenza and 19/39 (48.7%) for other viruses. During specific RSV epidemic periods, only 8/46 (17.4%) mPCR tests were positive for RSV and 14/46 (30.4%) for other viruses. 477/1529 (31.2%) of RSV immunochromatography-tests were positive. Among the negatives immunochromatography-test also explored by mPCR, 28/62 (31%) were positive for other respiratory viruses. CONCLUSION: This study provides a wide description of respiratory viruses’ distribution among children in hospital settings using mPCR over 3 years. It emphasizes the number of undiagnosed respiratory viruses according to the current diagnosis practice in France and gives a better picture of respiratory viruses identified in hospital settings by mPCR all over the year in France.","Visseaux, Benoit; Collin, Gilles; Ichou, Houria; Charpentier, Charlotte; Bendhafer, Samia; Dumitrescu, Madalina; Allal, Lahcene; Cojocaru, Bogdan; Desfrère, Luc; Descamps, Diane; Mandelbrot, Laurent; Houhou-Fidouh, Nadhira",PLoS One,572,24

Establishing new radiotherapy (RT) infrastructure may be significantly compromised in the post COVID-19 era. Alternative strategies are needed to improve the existing RT accessibility without significant cost escalation. The outcomes of these approaches on the RT availability has been examined for Asia. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The details of RT infrastructures in 2020 for 51 countries in Asia were obtained from the Directory of Radiotherapy Centers of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Using the IAEA guidelines, the %RT accessibility and the additional requirements of teletherapy (TRT) units were computed for these countries. To maximize the utilization of the existing RT facilities, five options were evaluated, namely, hypofractionation RT (HFRT) alone, with/without 25% or 50% additional working hours. The impact of these strategies on the %RT access and additional TRT unit requirements to achieve 100% RT access were estimated. RESULTS: 4617 TRT units are available in 46 countries. The mean %RT accessibility is 62.4% in 43 countries (TRT units =4491) where the information on cancer incidence was also available and these would need an additional 6474 TRT units for achieving 100% RT accessibility. By adopting HFRT alone, increasing the working hours by 25% alone, 25% with HFRT, 50% alone and 50% with HFRT; the %RT access could improve to 74.9%, 78%, 90.5%, 93.7% and 106.1% respectively. Correspondingly, the need for additional TRT units would progressively decrease to 4646, 4284, 3073, 2820 and 1958 units. CONCLUSION: The economic slowdown in the post Covid-19 period could severely impend establishment of new RT facilities. Thus, maximal utilization of the available RT infrastructure with minimum additional costs could be possible by adopting HFRT with or without increased working hours to improve the RT coverage.","Datta, Niloy R.; Datta, Sneha; Samiei, Massoud",Adv Radiat Oncol,572,10

This study investigated the impact of the pandemic and the switch to telehealth on the clinic return rates by ethnicity, race, gender, rurality, and age. The pandemic led to a 47.4% reduction in the number of monthly patient encounters. Of the established SRFC population (N = 309), only 87 patients (28.2%) returned for a telehealth visit during the COVID-19 pandemic. Older patients (≥ 45 years old) were more likely to return (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.02–2.85) for care via telehealth after the onset of the pandemic than younger patients (< 45 years old). No differences in the likelihood of returning for a telehealth visit were identified by race, ethnicity, gender, or rurality.

Disseminating synopses of clinical evidence from systematic reviews or randomized trials is regarded as a potentially effective strategy to promote evidence uptake. The study aimed to identify barriers and facilitators to implementing this strategy among Hong Kong Chinese medicine practitioners (CMPs). METHODS: Twenty-five CMPs aged under 45 years and trained in Hong Kong after reunification with China in 1997 were interviewed individually. Four clinical evidence synopses of randomized trials and systematic reviews on Chinese medicine interventions were presented, and CMPs were asked to comment on their applicability in routine practice. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) was applied to guide interview and analysis. RESULTS: The barriers included: i) CMPs’ perceived difficulties in applying complex evidence in decision-making and ii) inadequate training and limited consultation time. The facilitators were i) availability of publicly accessible and user-friendly synopses, ii) formation of community of evidence-based practice among CMPs with input from key opinion leaders, iii) opportunity for interprofessional collaborations with conventional healthcare providers, and iv) patients’ demand for evidence-based clinical advice. Besides, i) CMPs’ knowledge and beliefs in evidence-based healthcare approach, ii) presentations of evidence-based information in the synopses, and iii) clinical decision making as influenced by quality of evidence reported acted as both barriers and facilitators. CONCLUSIONS: This CFIR-based qualitative study investigated how the World Health Organization recommendation of promoting evidence use in routine practice was perceived by CMPs trained in Hong Kong after reunification with China in 1997. Key barriers and facilitators to applying evidence were identified. Such results will inform tailoring of implementation strategies for promoting evidence uptake, in the context of a well-developed health system dominated by conventional medicine.

The level of awareness and knowledge of the disease as well as the related attitude and practice amongst hospital workers could determine its extent of control. The aim of this study was to determine the knowledge, attitude and practices amongst hospital staff regarding COVID-19. METHODS: this cross-sectional study was conducted among staff of the Niger Delta University Teaching Hospital, Bayelsa State, Nigeria. A self-administered semi-structured questionnaire was adapted in assessing their knowledge, attitude and practice towards COVID-19. RESULTS: one hundred and twenty four respondents completed the study with a mean age of 30.9 ± 6.5 years. Up to 90% of them demonstrated good knowledge of COVID-19 with regard to preventive and control measures. Approximately 90% of them practiced good hand hygiene though a lesser proportion wore face masks (51.6%) and practiced crowd avoidance (58.1%). Medical doctors had a marginally higher practice score compared with “others” (p = 0,047).

Regarding the differences in the infection rate observed in each region, additionally to studies investigating the causes of differences in population density as a proxy for social distancing, an increasing trend of studies investigating the causes of differences in social capital has also been seen (ie, value sharing, acceptance of norms, unity, and trust through reciprocity). However, studies investigating whether social capital that controls the effects of population density also influences the infection rate are limited. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed the relationship between infection rate, population density, and social capital using statistical data of Japan’s every prefecture. Statistical analysis showed that social capital not only negatively correlates with infection rates and population densities, but also negatively correlates with infection rates controlling for the effects of population density. Additionally, controlling the relationship between the variables by mean age showed that social capital had a greater correlation with infection rate than population density. In other words, social capital mediates the relationship between population density and infection rates, indicating that social distancing alone is not enough to deter coronavirus disease; social capital needs to be recharged.","Kokubun, Keisuke; Yamakawa, Yoshinori",Inquiry,572,8

Data has shown that age, gender and obesity are strongly correlated with poor outcomes in COVID-19 positive patients. Bariatric surgery is the only treatment that provides significant, sustained weight loss in the severely obese. We look at whether prior bariatric surgery correlates with increased risk of hospitalization and outcome severity after COVID-19 infection. MethodsA cross-sectional retrospective analysis of a COVID-19 database from a single, NYC-based, academic institution was conducted. A cohort of COVID-19 positive patients with a history of bariatric surgery (n=124) were matched in a 4:1 ratio to a control cohort of COVID-19 positive patients who were eligible for bariatric surgery (BMI [â¥]40 kg/m2 or BMI [â¥]35 kg/m2 with a comorbidity) (n=496). A comparison of outcomes, including mechanical ventilation requirements and deceased at discharge, was done between cohorts using Chi-square test or Fishers exact test. Additionally, overall length of stay and duration of time in ICU were compared using Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. Conditional logistic regression analyses were done to determine both unadjusted (UOR) and adjusted odds ratios (AOR). ResultsA total of 620 COVID-19 positive patients were included in this analysis. The categorization of bariatric surgeries included 36% Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB, n=45), 35% laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB, n=44), and 28% laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG, n=35). The body mass index (BMI) for the bariatric group was 36.1 kg/m2 (SD=8.3), which was significantly lower than the control group, 41.4 kg/m2 (SD=6.5) (p<0.0001). There was also less burden of diabetes in the bariatric group (32%) compared to the control group (48%) (p=0.0019). Patients with a history of bariatric surgery were less likely to be admitted through the emergency room (UOR=0.39, p=0.0001), less likely to have had a ventilator used during the admission (UOR=0.42, p=0.028), had a shorter length of stay in both the ICU (p=0.033) and overall (UOR=0.44, p=0.0002), and were less likely to be deceased at discharge compared to the control group (OR=0.42, p=0.028).

Mutation or recombination of HAdV genes may cause changes in its pathogenicity and transmission. We described the epidemiology and genotypic diversity of HAdV in hospitalized children with RTIs in Beijing, China. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from hospitalized children with RTIs from April 2018 to March 2019. HAdVs were detected by a quantitative real-time PCR, and the hexon gene was used for phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: Among 1572 samples, 90 (5.72%) were HAdV-positive. The HAdV detection rate was highest in November and July. Among HAdV-positive children, 61.11% (55/90) were co-infected with other respiratory viruses, the most common of which were human respiratory syncytial virus and human rhinovirus. The main diagnosis was bronchopneumonia, most patient have cough and fever. Children with a high viral load were more likely to have a high fever (P = 0.041) and elevated WBC count (P = 0.000). Of 55 HAdV-positive specimens, HAdV-B (63.64%), HAdV-C (27.27%), and HAdV-E (9.09%) were main epidemic species. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that hexon sequences of three samples were on the same branch with the recombinant HAdV strain (CBJ113), which was circulating in Beijing since 2016. CONCLUSION: The HAdV-B3 and HAdV-B7 are the main epidemic strains in Beijing, and the recombinant HAdV-C strain CBJ113 has formed an epidemic trend.

Thirteen gnotobiotic calves were infected with coronavirus isolates derived from faeces or respiratory material: virus was detected in faeces and nasal swabs from all animals. In 115 calves from a field survey, there was a significant association between coronavirus excretion from both respiratory and enteric routes in calves with diarrhoea. In a further 12 calves, at necropsy, the predilection sites for coronavirus growth were the distal small intestine, large intestine and the epithelia of the nasal cavity and trachea. Antigen was not found in lung tissue by immunofluoresence or immunoperoxidase staining. Infection with enteric coronavirus induced immunity to reinfection and to heterologous challenge with two coronavirus isolates derived from the respiratory tract. Nine coronaviruses were cultivated, cloned and antisera to three were prepared in pigs. There was complete virus neutralisation in tests with homologous sera and significant cross reactions with the eight other isolates which were of intestinal and respiratory origin. Thus, these bovine coronavirus isolates belonged to the same serotype despite the source of virus.","Reynolds, D. J.; Debney, T. G.; Hall, G. A.; Thomas, L. H.; Parsons, K. R.",Arch Virol,572,22

Chronic excessive use of alcohol can compromise intestinal integrity, leading to changes in gut microbiota (GM) composition known as dysbiosis. Dysbiosis, by disruption of the gut-brain axis (GBA), further exacerbates the deleterious effects of alcohol. One of the fermentation by-products of GM is butyrate (BUT), a short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) that plays an important role in maintaining homeostasis of the GBA. Alcohol metabolism results in formation of acetaldehyde, a highly reactive compound that reacts with dopamine in the brain to form toxic adducts such as salsolinol. Recent studies indicate potential neuro-protective effects of BUT against various toxicants including salsolinol. Here, we sought to investigate whether BUT can also protect against alcohol toxicity. Pretreatment of neuroblastoma-derived SH-SY5Y cells with 500 mM ethanol (ETOH) for 24 h resulted in approximately 40% reduction in cell viability, which was totally blocked by 10 µM of either BUT or AR 420,626 (AR), a selective fatty acid 3 receptor (FA3R) agonist. The neuro-protective effects of both BUT and AR were significantly (80%) attenuated by beta-hydroxy butyrate (BHB), a selective FA3R antagonist. Interestingly, combination of BUT and AR resulted in synergistic protection against ETOH, which was totally blocked by BHB. These findings suggest potential utility of butyrate and/or FA3R agonists against ETOH-induced toxicity.","Getachew, Bruk; Csoka, Antonei B.; Garden, Allison R.; Copeland, Robert L.; Tizabi, Yousef",Neurotox Res,572,10

The relation between air pollution and local firm performance is insignificant, implying that the air pollution effects can be attributed to investor mood bias rather than to economic effects. The sensitivity of stock returns to air pollution is significantly large for high-growth stocks, distressed stocks, and stocks with high volatility.","Wu, Qinqin; Hao, Ying; Lu, Jing",Pacific-Basin Finance Journal,572,10

Jeju Island is the largest island in South Korea and has a distinctive oceanic climate. This study aimed to identify epidemiologic characteristics of scrub typhus on Jeju Island. METHODS: From January 2011 to December 2016, 446 patients were diagnosed with scrub typhus on Jeju Island. The patients’ personal data and the environmental factors that might be related to scrub typhus were investigated and retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 58-years-old (range, 8 to 91) and 43% of them worked in the agricultural, forestry or livestock industry. Regardless of their job, 87% of the patients had a history of either working outdoors or of other activities before developing scrub typhus. The south and southeast regions of Jeju Island, especially Namwon-eup, showed the highest incidence of scrub typhus. Workers in mandarin orange orchards seemed to be the highest risk group for scrub typhus infection. CONCLUSIONS: Scrub typhus on Jeju Island showed unique characteristics. To efficiently prevent scrub typhus, each year individual regional approaches should be developed based on the epidemiologic characteristics of the disease.","Lee, Sung Uk",Epidemiol Health,572,16

The data set includes equity (Bitcoin and Standard and Poor’s 500), precious metals (Gold and Silver), and energy markets (West Texas Instruments, Brent, and Gas). The generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity model is applied to the return series. The wavelet packet Shannon entropy is calculated from the estimated volatility series to assess randomness. Hierarchical clustering is employed to examine interconnections between volatilities. We found that (i) randomness in volatility of the S&P500 and in the volatility of precious metals were the most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, while (ii) randomness in energy markets was less affected by the pandemic than equity and precious metal markets. Additionally, (iii) we showed an apparent emergence of three volatility clusters: precious metals (Gold and Silver), energy (Brent and Gas), and Bitcoin and WTI, and (iv) the S&P500 volatility represents a unique cluster, while (v) the S&P500 market volatility was not connected to the volatility of Bitcoin, energy, and precious metal markets before the pandemic. Moreover, (vi) the S&P500 market volatility became connected to volatility in energy markets and volatility in Bitcoin during the pandemic, and (vii) the volatility in precious metals is less connected to volatility in energy markets and to volatility in Bitcoin market during the pandemic. It is concluded that (i) investors may diversify their portfolios across single constituents of clusters, (ii) investing in energy markets during the pandemic period is appealing because of lower randomness in their respective volatilities, and that (iii) constructing a diversified portfolio would not be challenging as clustering structures are fairly stable across periods.","Lahmiri, Salim; Bekiros, Stelios",Entropy (Basel),572,3

In three studies of behavior on putative online forums, supporters of a political cause (e.g., abortion or gun rights) preferentially censored comments that opposed their cause. The tendency to selectively censor cause-incongruent online content was amplified among people whose cause-related beliefs were deeply rooted in or “fused with” their identities. Moreover, six additional identity-related measures also amplified the selective censoring effect. Finally, selective censoring emerged even when opposing comments were inoffensive and courteous. We suggest that because online censorship enacted by moderators can skew online content consumed by millions of users, it can systematically disrupt democratic dialogue and subvert social harmony.","Ashokkumar, Ashwini; Talaifar, Sanaz; Fraser, William T.; Landabur, Rodrigo; Buhrmester, Michael; Gómez, Ángel; Paredes, Borja; Swann, William B.",J Exp Soc Psychol,572,16

Digital pathology has the capability to meet some of these unprecedented challenges by allowing remote diagnoses to be made at home, during periods of social distancing or self-isolation. However, while digital pathology allows diagnoses to be made on standard computer screens, unregulated home environments may not be conducive for optimal viewing conditions. There is also a paucity of experimental evidence available to support the minimum display requirements for digital pathology. This study presents a Point-of-Use Quality Assurance (POUQA) tool for remote assessment of viewing conditions for reporting digital pathology slides. The tool is a psychophysical test combining previous work from successfully implemented quality assurance tools in both pathology and radiology to provide a minimally intrusive display screen validation task, before viewing digital slides. The test is specific to pathology assessment in that it requires visual discrimination between colors derived from hematoxylin and eosin staining, with a perceptual difference of ±1 delta E (dE).

The aim of this work was to determine the indications for emergency hemodialysis, the clinical and paraclinical profiles of the patients, as well as the parameters of the session of hemodialysis and the perdialytic complications. METHOD: This is a prospective descriptive and analytical study carried out over a period of 3 months (March 3, 2020 - June 6, 2020). This period coincides with the coronavirus pandemic. This study was included all patients who have undergone Emergency hemodialysis. The study was done in the hemodialysis unit of the nephrology department of the CHU Fattouma Bourguiba Monastir. RESULTS: We collected 68 patients, the majority are male (70%). The average age was 60 + -14.4 years. The original department was the emergency room in 42.6% of cases, the intensive care unit in 10.29% and a surgical department in 13.23% of cases. 40% of patients were diabetic and 22% had coronary insufficiency. 60.5% were a chronic renal failure, 16% were end-stage and 34% were on hemodialysis. The indications for emergency hemodialysis were acute lung edema, hyperkalaemia and metabolic acidosis in 31%, 50% and 50% of cases, respectively. Poorly tolerated uremia and anuria more than 12 hours were the indication in 11.8% and 10.3% of cases, respectively, drug or toxic intoxication (methanol) was in 5.9% of cases and hypercalcaemia in 4.4% of cases. The average duration of the sessions was 2.95 hours [2–4 hours]. Ultrafiltration was necessary in 44.11% of cases. Per-dialysis anticoagulation was used in 38.23% of patients. The vascular access was a femoral catheter in 67.6% of cases and an arteriovenous fistula in 28% of cases. The per-dialytic complications were hypotension in 10 cases (14.7%) and the session was stopped in 4 cases. hypoglycemia was noted in 2 cases (2.9%) and seizures in 2 cases. Cardiopulmonary arrest was reported in 2.9% of sessions. The incidence of bleeding complications occurring within 72 hours after the hemodialysis session was 5.8%.The death rate was 13.2%. Our univariate analysis concluded that diabetes, heart failure and coronary artery disease, history of gastrointestinal bleeding and active infection are risk factors for mortality. The multivariate analysis showed that diabetes and a history of gastrointestinal bleeding was the two factors of mortality. CONCLUSION: The confinement period has affected the medical activity in our department. So, it has increased the cases of emergency hemodialysis with more complications.","Chemli, Imen; Amal, Ouni; Haoula, Faouzi; Ben salem, Meriem; Ben salah, Manel; Handous, Insaf; Letaief, Ahmed; Hamouda, Mouna; Aloui, Sabra; Skhiri, Habib",Nephrol Dial Transplant,572,26

Visitors of healthcare facilities are the high-risk groups due to the presence of suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the healthcare setting. Increasing the knowledge, attitude, and practices towards COVID-19 prevention among hospital visitors are very important to prevent transmissions of the pandemic despite the lack of evidence remains a challenge in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the status of knowledge, attitude, and preventive practice towards COVID-19 and associated factors among hospital visitors in South Gondar Zone Hospitals, Northwest Ethiopia. METHODS: A facility-based cross-sectional study design was employed during August 1 to 30, 2020 from randomly selected 404 adult hospital visitors in South Gondar Zone Hospitals, Northwest Ethiopia. The data was collected using interviewer-administered questionnaire. The outcome of this study was good or poor knowledge, positive or negative attitude and good or poor preventive practice towards COVID-19. Three different binary logistic regression models with 95% CI (Confidence interval) was used for data analysis. For each mode, bivariable analysis (crude odds ratio [COR]) and multivariable analysis (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]) was used during data analysis. From the bivariable analysis, variables with a p-value <0.25 were retained into the multivariable logistic regression analysis. From the multivariable logistic regression analysis, variables with a significance level of p-value <0.05 were taken as factors independently associated with knowledge, attitude and preventive practices towards COVID-19. MAIN FINDINGS: About 69.3% of the respondents had good knowledge, 62.6% had a positive attitude, and 49.3% had good preventive practice towards the prevention of COVID-19. We found that factors significantly associated with good knowledge about COVID-19 were educational status who can read and write (AOR = 2.78; 95%CI: 1.18–6.56) and college and above (AOR = 6.15; 95%CI: 2.18–17.40), and use of social media (AOR = 2.96; 95%CI: 1.46–6.01). Furthermore, factors significantly associated with a positive attitude towards COVID-19 includes the presence of chronic illnesses (AOR = 5.00; 95%CI; 1.71–14.67), training on COVID-19 (AOR = 3.91; 95%CI: 1.96–7.70), and peer/family as a source of information (AOR = 2.45; 95%CI: 1.06–5.63). Being a student (AOR = 7.70; 95%CI: 1.15–15.86) and participants who had a good knowledge on COVID-19 (AOR = 4.49; 95%CI: 2.41–8.39) were factors significantly associated with good practice towards COVID-19. CONCLUSION: We found that knowledge, attitude, and preventive practices towards prevention of COVID-19 among adult hospital visitors were low. Therefore, we recommended that different intervention strategies for knowledge, attitude and preventive practices are urgently needed to control the transmission of COVID-19 among adult hospital visitors. Health education of those who could not read and write about COVID-19 knowledge issues and advocating use of social media that transmit messages about COVID-19 are highly encouraged to increase the good knowledge status of adult hospital visitors. Furthermore, providing training about COVID-19 prevention methods and using various sources of information about COVID-19 will help for improving positive attitude towards COVID-19 prevention, whereas for increasing the status of good preventive practices towards COVID-19, improving the good knowledge about COVID-19 of adult hospital visitors are essential.","Belete, Zebader Walle; Berihun, Gete; Keleb, Awoke; Ademas, Ayechew; Berhanu, Leykun; Abebe, Masresha; Gizeyatu, Adinew; Hassen, Seada; Teshome, Daniel; Lingerew, Mistir; Feleke, Alelgne; Natnael, Tarikuwa; Adane, Metadel",PLoS One,572,20

While over 80% of initial hit compounds were pan-assay inhibitory compounds, three hits were confirmed as nsp15 endoU inhibitors in the 1-20 μM range in vitro. Furthermore, Exebryl-1, a β-amyloid anti-aggregation molecule for Alzheimer’s therapy, was shown to have antiviral activity between 10 to 66 μM, in VERO, Caco-2, and Calu-3 cells. Although the inhibitory concentrations determined for Exebryl-1 exceed those recommended for therapeutic intervention, our findings show great promise for further optimization of Exebryl-1 as an nsp15 endoU inhibitor and as a SARS-CoV-2 antiviral. Author summary Drugs to treat COVID-19 are urgently needed. To address this, we searched libraries of drugs and drug-like molecules for inhibitors of an essential enzyme of the virus that causes COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein (nsp)15. We found several molecules that inhibited the nsp15 enzyme function and one was shown to be active in inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This demonstrates that searching for SARS-CoV-2 nsp15 inhibitors can lead inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2, and thus therapeutics for COVID-19. We are currently working to see if these inhibitors could be turned into a drug to treat COVID-19.","Choi, Ryan; Zhou, Mowei; Shek, Roger; Wilson, Jesse W.; Tillery, Logan; Craig, Justin K.; Salukhe, Indraneel A.; Hickson, Sarah E.; Kumar, Neeraj; James, Rhema M.; Buchko, Garry W; Wu, Ruilian; Huff, Sydney; Nguyen, Tu-Trinh; Hurst, Brett L.; Cherry, Sara; Barrett, Lynn K.; Hyde, Jennifer L.; Van Voorhis, Wesley C.",bioRxiv,572,20

Sixty‐two COVID‐19 patients in the First Hospital of Hunan University of Chinese Medicine and Loudi Center for Diseases Prevention and Control, from January to March 2020, were sampled as the novel coronavirus pneumonia infected group. One hundred and thirty‐one cases from the First Hospital of Hunan University of Chinese Medicine, including 67 healthy individuals and 64 non‐COVID‐19 inpatients, served as the noninfected group. Approximately every 5 days, sera from 20 cases were collected and analyzed three times, using an automatic biochemical analyzer, to detect serum MMP3 concentrations. Correlation was analyzed between MMP3 and other proinflammatory cytokines. Following normality tests, differences in serum MMP3 levels between the infected and noninfected group were analyzed via SPSS (version 25.0) software, using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. The MMP3 concentration was 44.44 (23.46 ~ 72.12) ng/mL in the infected group and 32.42 (28.16 ~ 41.21) ng/mL in the noninfected group. The difference between the two groups was statistically significant (Z = −2.799, P = .005 < .05). A positive correlation was found between MMP3 and interleukin 1β (IL‐1β; r = .681, P = .000 < .05), and IL‐6 (r = .529, P = .002 < .05). Serum MMP3 concentration, measured over three separate time points, were 55.98 (30.80 ~ 75.97) ng/mL, 34.84 (0.00 ~ 51.84) ng/mL, and 5.71 (0.00 ~ 40.46) ng/mL, respectively. Detection of serum MMP3 levels may play an important role in the development of therapeutic approaches for COVID‐19 and may indicate the severity of disease.","Shi, Shengjie; Su, Min; Shen, Ge; Hu, Yan; Yi, Fan; Zeng, Ziyan; Zhu, Pan; Yang, Gang; Zhou, Hui; Li, Qiong; Xie, Xiaobing",J Med Virol,572,27

Two important determinants of variant spread are how frequently they arise within individuals and how likely they are to be transmitted. To characterize within-host diversity and transmission, we deep-sequenced 1313 clinical samples from the United Kingdom. SARS-CoV-2 infections are characterized by low levels of within-host diversity when viral loads are high and by a narrow bottleneck at transmission. Most variants are either lost or occasionally fixed at the point of transmission, with minimal persistence of shared diversity, patterns that are readily observable on the phylogenetic tree. Our results suggest that transmission-enhancing and/or immune-escape SARS-CoV-2 variants are likely to arise infrequently but could spread rapidly if successfully transmitted.","Lythgoe, Katrina A.; Hall, Matthew; Ferretti, Luca; de Cesare, Mariateresa; MacIntyre-Cockett, George; Trebes, Amy; Andersson, Monique; Otecko, Newton; Wise, Emma L.; Moore, Nathan; Lynch, Jessica; Kidd, Stephen; Cortes, Nicholas; Mori, Matilde; Williams, Rebecca; Vernet, Gabrielle; Justice, Anita; Green, Angie; Nicholls, Samuel M.; Ansari, M.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LV-GLS) and right ventricular longitudinal strain (RV-LS) in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this prospective, single-center study, data were gathered from patients treated for COVID-19 between April 15 and April 30, 2020. Two-dimensional echocardiography (2-DE) and speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) images were obtained for all patients. Patients were divided into three groups: those with severe COVID-19 infection, those with non-severe COVID-19 infection, and those without COVID-19 infection (the control group). Data regarding clinical characteristics and laboratory findings were obtained from electronic medical records. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. A total of 100 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 were included in this study. The mean age of the severe group (n = 44) was 59.1 ± 12.9, 40% of whom were male. The mean age of the non-severe group (n = 56) was 53.7 ± 15.1, 58% of whom were male. Of these patients, 22 died in the hospital. In patients in the severe group, LV-GLS and RV-LS were decreased compared to patients in the non-severe and control groups (LV-GLS: − 14.5 ± 1.8 vs. − 16.7 ± 1.3 vs. − 19.4 ± 1.6, respectively [p < 0.001]; RV-LS: − 17.2 ± 2.3 vs. − 20.5 ± 3.2 vs. − 27.3 ± 3.1, respectively [p < 0.001]).

Open tumorectomy was performed with parenchymal clamping. The warm ischemia time was 18 min. Pathologic examination confirmed a diagnosis of pT1a clear cell renal cell carcinoma with negative surgical margins. At 3 months postoperatively, computed tomography showed no local recurrence or metastasis and renal function was intact. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Horseshoe kidney is a rare congenital abnormality. Renal cell carcinoma is the most frequent tumor in adults having this anomaly and treatment in localised tumors if usually tumorectomy. Surgery may be challenging in some cases because of its difficulty. CONCLUSION: Open surgery remains the standard treatment for horseshoe kidney tumors because of anatomic complexity and especially in cases where the tumor is difficult to extirpate.","Saadi, Mohamed Hafedh; Chakroun, Marouene; Saadi, Ahmed; Derouiche, Amine; Ayed, Haroun; Chebil, Mohamed",Int J Surg Case Rep,572,16

CoV2-S1-induced NF-κB activation requires S1 interaction with human ACE2 receptor and early activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and associated unfolded protein response (UPR), and MAP kinase signalling pathways. We developed an antagonistic peptide that inhibits S1-ACE2 interaction and CoV2-S1-induced productions of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The existing FDA-approved ER stress inhibitor, 4-phenylburic acid (4-PBA), and MAP kinase inhibitors, trametinib and ulixertinib, ameliorated CoV2-S1-induced inflammation and epithelial damage.

DESIGN: Quality improvement report. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: First 3 years of experience of an inpatient geriatric hemodialysis rehabilitation program in Toronto. Patients with new-onset disability from prolonged illness or an acute event rendering them incapable of living independently. QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PLAN: Provision of in-patient rehabilitation with on-site dialysis; a simplified referral system; preferential admission of elderly dialysis patients; short daily dialysis sessions; integrated multidisciplinary care by experts in rehabilitation, geriatric medicine, and nephrology; and reciprocal continued medical education among staff. MEASURES: Outcome measures were percentage of patients discharged home, score on the Functional Independence Measure, and attainment of rehabilitation goals. RESULTS: In the first 36 months, 164 dialysis patients aged 74.5 ± 7.8 years were admitted. On admission, patients had a mean Charlson comorbidity score of 7.8 ± 2.5, 98% had difficulty walking, and 84% required help with bed-to-chair transfers. After a median of 48.5 days, 111 patients (69%) were discharged home; 15 patients (9%), to an assisted-living setting; 20 patients (12%), to a long-term care facility; and 18 patients (11%), to other facilities for acute or palliative care. Of those completing therapy, 82% met some or all of their rehabilitation goals. LIMITATIONS: The program relied on the leadership and drive of key personnel. Discharge disposition as an outcome can be affected by many factors, and definition of attainment of rehabilitation goals is arbitrary.

The COVID- 19 pandemic that hit Austria in 2020 led to several lockdown events such as closing of bars, clubs, hotels and the order to stay at home. The current study was designed to elucidate the influence of these measures in order to curtail the pandemic on the number of N. gonorrhoeae diagnosed and their respective resistance patterns. Methods Retrospective data of patients positive for N. gonorrhoeae and resistances to ceftriaxone, cefixime, azithromycin and penicillin were compared using data from 2019 and 2020 collected in and sent to the Outpatients Centre for Infectious Venero-dermatological Diseases in Vienna. Resistance testing was carried out by means of the Etest®;MIC values were interpreted according to EUCAST guidelines. Results Numbers of patients tested positive for N. gonorrhoeae declined dramatically from 639 in 2019 to 381 in 2020. The most prominent reduction was during the first lockdown (March to May 2020), with half as many gonococcal infections compared to this period in 2019. The second lockdown (November/December 2020) did not result in significantly lower numbers of gonococcal infected patients. In both years, no ceftriaxone-resistant isolate was detected. However, 2.3% of isolates from women showed borderline susceptibility (MIC = 0.094 and 0.125mg/ml), compared to 0.4% of isolates from men. During the two years of evaluation, cefixime and azithromycin resistant strains decreased (4% to 0% and 19% to 7%, respectively), while penicillin-resistant strains increased from 9% to 20%. Conclusion The first lockdown resulted in a decrease of 62.7% of infected individuals. A remarkable decrease of resistant gonococcal strains to azithromycin and no resistance to cefixime occurred in 2020. This is in contrast to an increase of resistances until 2019.

A rush to find a cure prompted re-evaluation of a range of existing therapeutics vis-à-vis their potential role in treating COVID-19, placing a premium on analytical tools capable of supporting such efforts. Native mass spectrometry (MS) has long been a tool of choice in supporting the mechanistic studies of drug/therapeutic target interactions, but its applications remain limited in the cases that involve systems with a high level of structural heterogeneity. Both SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S-protein), a critical element of the viral entry to the host cell, and ACE2, its docking site on the host cell surface, are extensively glycosylated, making them challenging targets for native MS. However, supplementing native MS with a gas-phase ion manipulation technique (limited charge reduction) allows meaningful information to be obtained on the noncovalent complexes formed by ACE2 and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S-protein. Using this technique in combination with molecular modeling also allows the role of heparin in destabilizing the ACE2/RBD association to be studied, providing critical information for understanding the molecular mechanism of its interference with the virus docking to the host cell receptor. Both short (pentasaccharide) and relatively long (eicosasaccharide) heparin oligomers form 1:1 complexes with RBD, indicating the presence of a single binding site. This association alters the protein conformation (to maximize the contiguous patch of the positive charge on the RBD surface), resulting in a notable decrease in its ability to associate with ACE2. The destabilizing effect of heparin is more pronounced in the case of the longer chains due to the electrostatic repulsion between the low-pI ACE2 and the heparin segments not accommodated on the RBD surface. In addition to providing important mechanistic information on attenuation of the ACE2/RBD association by heparin, the study demonstrates the yet untapped potential of native MS coupled to gas-phase ion chemistry as a means of facilitating rational repurposing of the existing medicines for treating COVID-19.","Yang, Yang; Du, Yi; Kaltashov, Igor A.",Anal Chem,572,1

Because the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic decreased regulatory barriers and increased accessibility of telehealth, improved understanding of expectations may direct future educational efforts, improve implementation strategies, and inform future analyses of consumer adoption and utilization of telehealth. Methods: A cross-sectional survey design was used to measure ideal expectations (what they want to happen) and realistic expectations (what they think will happen) of telerehabilitation-naive patients for synchronous telerehabilitation. Participants were recruited through e-mail and social media and in person from seven outpatient private practice physical therapy clinics across the United States. Patients completed an online anonymous adaptation of the Patients' Expectations Questionnaire (PEQ) and were asked whether they expected synchronous telerehabilitation to benefit them personally. Open-ended responses were collected and analyzed for categories and themes. Results: Of 178 participants, the greatest mean difference between ideal and realistic expectations among PEQ subscales was for outcomes (0.49; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37-0.60), and the greatest mean difference among individual items was for symptom reduction (0.53; 95% CI, 0.41-0.66). Although participants appeared to appreciate the value of telerehabilitation visits, with 69.7% indicating that it would benefit them personally, many expressed a preference for face-to-face visits when possible. Discussion: Expectations were mostly positive. Lower outcomes expectations may be a potential barrier to adoption and utilization of telehealth and other types of digital physical therapy in some patients. Conclusions: To improve beliefs and address potential barriers, physical therapy clinicians should discuss expectations with patients before recommending telerehabilitation visits.","Peterson, Seth; Young, Jodi; King, Visnja; Meadows, Jeff",Telemed. j. e. health,572,16

We ascertained IgG levels across a single US metropolitan site, Chicago, from June 2020 through December 2020. METHODS: Participants (n = 7935) were recruited through electronic advertising and received materials for a self-sampled dried-blood spot assay through the mail or a minimal contact in-person method. IgG against the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 was measured using an established highly sensitive and highly specific assay. RESULTS: Overall seroprevalence was 17.9%, with no significant difference between method of contact. Only 2.5% of participants reported having had a diagnosis of COVID-19 based on virus detection, consistent with a 7-fold greater exposure to SARS-CoV-2 measured by serology than that detected by viral testing. The range of IgG level observed in seropositive participants from this community survey overlapped with the range of IgG levels associated with COVID-19 cases having a documented positive PCR test. From a subset of those who participated in repeat testing, half of seropositive individuals retained detectable antibodies for 3 to 4 months. CONCLUSION: Quantitative IgG measurements with a highly specific and sensitive assay indicated more widespread exposure to SARS-CoV-2 than observed by viral testing. The range of IgG concentrations produced from these asymptomatic exposures was similar to IgG levels occurring after documented nonhospitalized COVID-19, which were considerably lower than those produced from hospitalized COVID-19 cases. The differing ranges of IgG response, coupled with the rate of decay of antibodies, may influence response to subsequent viral exposure and vaccine.

As COVID-19 pandemic reached and endured in every corner on earth, countries with moderate to strong healthcare support and expenditure seemed to struggle in containing disease transmission and casualties. COVID-19 affected countries have variability in demographic, socioeconomic and life style health indicators. At this context it is important to find out at what extent these parametric variations are actually modulating disease outcomes. To answer this, we have selected demographic, socioeconomic and health indicators e.g. population density, percentage of urban population, median age, health expenditure per capita, obesity, diabetes prevalence, alcohol intake, tobacco use, case fatality of non communicable diseases (NCDs) as independent variables. Countries were grouped according to these variables and influence on dependent variables e.g. COVID-19 test positive, case fatality and case recovery rates were statistically analyzed. The results suggest that countries with variable median age has significantly different outcome on test positive rate (P<0.01). Both median age (P=0.0397) and health expenditure per capita (P=0.0041) has positive relation with case recovery. Increasing number of test per 100K population showed positive and negative relation with number of positives per 100K population (P=0.0001) and percentage of test positives (P<0.0001) respectively. Alcohol intake per capita in liter (P=0.0046), diabetes prevalence (P=0.0389) and NCDs mortalities (P=0.0477) also showed statistical relation with case fatality rate. Further analysis revealed that countries with high healthcare expenditure along with high median age and increased urban population showed more case fatality but also had better recovery rate. Investment in health sector alone is insufficient in controlling pandemic severity.

The countries of the world had to declare complete lockdown when the coronavirus led to community spread. Although the real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test is the gold-standard test for COVID-19 screening, it is not satisfactorily accurate and sensitive. On the other hand, Computer Tomography (CT) scan images are much more sensitive and can be suitable for COVID-19 detection. To this end, in this paper, we develop a fully automated method for fast COVID-19 screening by using chest CT-scan images employing Deep Learning techniques. For this supervised image classification problem, a bootstrap aggregating or Bagging ensemble of three transfer learning models, namely, Inception v3, ResNet34 and DenseNet201, has been used to boost the performance of the individual models. The proposed framework, called ET-NET, has been evaluated on a publicly available dataset, achieving [Formula: see text] accuracy, [Formula: see text] precision, [Formula: see text] sensitivity and [Formula: see text] specificity on 5-fold cross-validation outperforming the state-of-the-art method on the same dataset by 1.56%.

Indeed, from February 2020, Italy is facing an explosion of COVID‐19 cases. In particular, the Italian observed case fatality rate (CFR) is much higher than the other countries. Recently, it has been hypothesized that the extensive number of intergenerational contacts—typical of Italian culture—could contribute to explain the high number of deaths observed in Italy. However, through an analysis performed for all the Italian regions, here it is shown that the deaths are localized in specific regions and that the CFRs of different Italian regions are overlapping with the rates of European countries. Moreover, through correlation analyses between CFRs and different social habits, it is shown that no positive correlation is observed between social behaviors and CFRs. In conclusion, this analysis clearly rejects the possibility that social habits and intergenerational contacts can contribute to explaining such a profound effect on the number of deaths observed in Italy during the COVID‐19 outbreak and more effort should be addressed to evaluate the real amount of positive cases.","Giangreco, Giovanni",J Med Virol,572,16

Using a systematic review of individual cases and case series and collating elements of the clinical course, the objective of this study was to provide a detailed clinical description and natural history of MIS-C. METHODS: Case reports and series of MIS-C were recovered from repeated MEDLINE searches, a single EMBASE search, and table of contents reviews of major general medicine and pediatric journals performed between June 3 and July 23, 2020. Fever, evidence of inflammation, and evidence of organ dysfunction were required for inclusion. RESULTS: MEDLINE and EMBASE searches produced 129 articles, and 10 articles were identified from journal contents or article bibliographies; 16 reports describing 505 children with MIS-C comprise this review. Thirty-two children (14.7%) had negative results for SARS-CoV-2 by nucleic acid and/or antibody testing. The weighted median age was 9 years (6 months to 20 years). Clinical findings included fever (100%), gastrointestinal symptoms (88.0%), rash (59.2%), conjunctivitis (50.0%), cheilitis/ “strawberry tongue” (55.7%), or extremity edema/erythema (47.5%). Median serum C-reactive protein, ferritin, fibrinogen, and D-dimer concentrations were above the normal range. Intravenous gammaglobulin (78.1%) and methylprednisolone/prednisone (57.6%) were the most common therapeutic interventions; immunomodulation was used in 24.3% of cases. Myocardial dysfunction requiring ionotropic support (57.4%) plus extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (5.3%), respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation (26.1%), and acute kidney injury (11.9%) were the major complications; anticoagulation was used commonly (54.4%), but thrombotic events occurred rarely (3.5%). Seven (1.4%) children died. CONCLUSIONS: MIS-C following SARS-CoV-2 infection frequently presents with gastrointestinal complaints and/or rash; conjunctivitis, cheilitis, and/or extremity changes also occur frequently. Serious complications occur frequently and respond to aggressive supportive therapy.","Aronoff, Stephen C; Hall, Ashleigh; Del Vecchio, Michael T",J Pediatric Infect Dis Soc,572,14

However, when included as a predictor in a model, it is conventionally modeled linearly, dichotomously, or categorically. We comprehensively examined different ways of modeling FBG to assess the risk of being admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Utilizing COVID-19 data from Kuwait, we fitted conventional approaches to modeling FBG as well as a nonlinear estimation using penalized splines. RESULTS: For 417 patients, the conventional linear, dichotomous, and categorical approaches to modeling FBG missed key trends in the exposure-response relationship. A nonlinear estimation showed a steep slope until about 10 mmol/L before flattening. CONCLUSIONS: Our results argue for strict glucose management on admission. Even a small incremental increase within the normal range of FBG was associated with a substantial increase in risk of ICU admission for COVID-19 patients.","Alahmad, Barrak; Al-Shammari, Abdullah A.; Bennakhi, Abdullah; Al-Mulla, Fahd; Ali, Hamad",Diabetes Care,572,4

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the other enveloped viruses become very weak against surfactant. The SARS virus binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) receptor and causes pneumonia. In the lung, the ACE2 receptor sits on the top of lung cells known as alveolar epithelial type II (AE2) cells. These cells play an important role in producing surfactant. Pulmonary surfactant is believed to regulate the alveolar surface tension in mammalian lungs. To our knowledge, AE2 cells are believed to act as immunoregulatory cells; however, pulmonary surfactant itself has not been believed to act as a defender against the enveloped viruses. This study hypothesises that pulmonary surfactant may be a strong defender of enveloped viruses. Therefore, old coronaviruses merely cause pneumonia. On the contrary, new SARS-CoV-2 can suppress the production of surfactant that binds to the ACE2 of AE2 cells. The coronavirus can survive in the lung tissue because of the exhaustion of pulmonary surfactant.","Takano, Hideyuki",Med Hypotheses,572,30

While hACE2 transgenic mice support infection and pathogenesis,(5) these mice are currently limited in availability and are restricted to a single genetic background. Here we report the development of a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 based on adeno associated virus (AAV)-mediated expression of hACE2. These mice support viral replication and antibody production and exhibit pathologic findings found in COVID-19 patients as well as non-human primate models. Moreover, we show that type I interferons are unable to control SARS-CoV2 replication and drive pathologic responses. Thus, the hACE2-AAV mouse model enables rapid deployment for in-depth analysis following robust SARS-CoV-2 infection with authentic patient-derived virus in mice of diverse genetic backgrounds.

PM impairments are common in people with neuropathology such as acquired brain injury and dementia. These PM impairments affect individuals’ capabilities in key aspects of daily living including their health, safety, and independence. The Prospective Memory Concerns Questionnaire (PMCQ) was designed as a self-report measure to understand individuals’ concerns about their memory. This questionnaire may help identify issues with PM which in turn may assist clinicians in the targeted implementation of memory compensation strategies. The PMCQ was developed using Rasch and classical test methodologies, with subscales measuring frequency of forgetting behaviors, memory concerns, and retrieval failures. The current study aimed to confirm the factor structure of the PMCQ for use in adults in the general population. The study also aimed to examine relationships between the PMCQ and naturalistic performance-based measures of PM to determine how the self-report PMCQ could be used in conjunction with performance-based measures. A community dwelling sample of 558 adults completed the PMCQ, an event-based naturalistic PM task, and time-based naturalistic PM task. Confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) indicated that a higher order model with three subscales containing 35 items produced acceptable fit [RMSEA = 0.056 (90% CI 0.054, 0.060), SRMR = 0.062, CFI = 0.915, TLI = 0.909] The PMCQ demonstrated good internal consistency (total α = 0.95, subscales: α = 0.88–0.89). The Forgetting Behaviors subscale significantly correlated with performance on the event-based naturalistic PM task (r = −0.14, p < 0.01). The Memory Concerns and Retrieval Failures subscales did not correlate significantly with performance-based PM tasks. These findings suggest that the PMCQ may be best suited for assessing individuals’ concerns about their forgetting behaviors and identifying appropriate compensation strategies or support services. It is recommended that the PMCQ be used alongside performance-based PM tasks and other cognitive measures to comprehensively assess PM. It was concluded that the PMCQ is a suitable measure for use in adults in the general population. Further validation research of the PMCQ in general population and clinical samples will determine the measures’ sensitivity and specificity in identifying PM impairments.","Sugden, Nicole; Thomas, Matt; Kiernan, Michael; Wilesmith, Michele",Front Hum Neurosci,572,20

Ethnic minority and financially insecure families had a worse experience during the lockdown across all domains, with the exception of mental health which appeared worse in White British mothers. Open text responses corroborated these findings and highlighted high levels of anxiety and fear about Covid-19.

Lung Ultrasound is increasingly employed in clinical practice but a standard approach and data about the accuracy of Lung Ultrasound are still needed. Our study's objective is to evaluate Lung Ultrasound diagnostic and prognostic characteristics in patients with suspected COVID-19. We conducted a monocentric, prospective, observational study. Patients with respiratory distress and suspected COVID-19 consecutively admitted in the Emergency Medicine Unit were enrolled. Lung Ultrasound examinations were performed blindly to clinical data. Outcomes were diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia and in-hospital mortality. 159 patients were included in our study, 66% were males and 63.5% had a final diagnosis of COVID-19. COVID-19 patients had a higher mortality rate (18.8% vs 6.9%, P=.04) and Lung Ultrasound Severity Index (16.14 [8.71] vs 10.08 [8.92], P<.001) compared to non-COVID-19 ones. This model proved able to distinguish between positive cases from negative ones with an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) equal to 0.72 (95% CI 0.64-0.78) and to predict in-hospital mortality with an AUROC equal to 0.81 (95% CI 0.74-0.86), in the whole population, and an AUROC equal to 0.76 (95% CI 0.66-0.84) in COVID-19 patients.

However, the relationship of social capital to the spread of infectious disease like COVID-19 is lacking. The COVID-19 pandemic presents an unprecedented threat to global health and economy, for which control strategies have relied on aggressive social distancing. However, an understanding of how social capital is related to changes in human mobility patterns for adherence to social distancing is lacking. Objective: This study examines the association between state- and county-level social capital indices and community health indices in the United States, and the growth rate of COVID-19 cases. It also examines changes in human mobility. Methods: Using publicly available state- and county-specific time series data for COVID-19 cases from March 13 to March 31, we used exponential fits to determine growth rate. We obtained publicly available mobility change data, originally measured from GPS-enabled mobile devices. The design was then state- and county-level correlation analysis with social capital and community health indices from the Social Capital Project (United States Senate). Results: In bivariate linear correlation analyses, we find social capital and community health indices were negatively associated with COVID-19 growth rates at both the state and county levels. The correlation was strongest at the county level for the community health index: a one-unit increase in the county community health index was associated with a decrease in the COVID-19 growth rate exponent by 0.045. In further bivariate correlation analyses, we find that social capital indices were negatively associated with retail/recreation movement and positively associated with residential movement. That is, an increase in social capital is correlated with slower COVID-19 infection spread and more adherence to social distancing protocols. Conclusion: Our results indicate the potential benefit of incorporating social capital concepts in planning policies to control the spread of COVID-19, e.g. different social distancing requirements in different communities. The results also indicate a need for further research into this potentially causal relationship, including examining interventions to increase social capital, community health, and institutional health.","Varshney, L.

We aimed to identify their clinical characteristics to help early diagnosis. METHODS: We retrospectively retrieved data for laboratory‐confirmed patients admitted with COVID‐19–induced or influenza A–induced pneumonia from electronic medical records in Ningbo First Hospital, China. We recorded patients' epidemiological and clinical features, as well as radiologic and laboratory findings. RESULTS: The median age of influenza A cohort was higher and it exhibited higher temperature and higher proportion of pleural effusion. COVID‐19 cohort exhibited higher proportions of fatigue, diarrhea and ground‐glass opacity and higher levels of lymphocyte percentage, absolute lymphocyte count, red‐cell count, hemoglobin and albumin and presented lower levels of monocytes, c‐reactive protein, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, serum creatinine. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that fatigue, ground‐glass opacity, and higher level of albumin were independent risk factors for COVID‐19 pneumonia, while older age, higher temperature, and higher level of monocyte count were independent risk factors for influenza A pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: In terms of COVID‐19 pneumonia and influenza A pneumonia, fatigue, ground‐glass opacity, and higher level of albumin tend to be helpful for diagnosis of COVID‐19 pneumonia, while older age, higher temperature, and higher level of monocyte count tend to be helpful for the diagnosis of influenza A pneumonia.","Lv, Ding‐feng; Ying, Qi‐ming; He, Yi‐wen; Liang, Jun; Zhang, Ji‐hong; Lu, Bei‐bei; Qian, Guo‐qing; Chu, Jin‐guo; Weng, Xing‐bei; Chen, Xue‐qin; Mu, Qi‐tian",J Clin Lab Anal,572,11

Many unverified methods are being considered, which can pose the risk of incomplete decontamination and lead to catastrophic results. Several factors come into play when determining the suitability of such methods including the quality of the decontamination technique, the targeted pathogen, cost, ease of installation and use, rate of sterilization, and the surface or material to be sterilized. The germicidal properties of ultraviolet-C are well known. This review will cover the most commonly described methods for the sterilization of N95 respirators, namely, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, hydrogen peroxide vaporization, microwave-generated steaming, and dry heating. These techniques have been tested previously and have demonstrated efficacy in reducing or inactivating viral and bacterial pathogens, although testing against SARS-CoV-2 specifically has not been done.

Pro-inflammatory macrophage differentiation remains a process facilitating a broad array of disease pathologies, and has recently emerged as a potential target against cytokine storm in COVID19. Here, we perform a whole-genome CRISPR screen to identify essential nodes regulating CD14 expression in myeloid cells, using the differentiation of THP-1 cells as a starting point. This strategy uncovers many known pathways required for CD14 expression and regulating macrophage differentiation while additionally providing a list of novel targets either promoting or limiting this process. To speed translation of these results, we have then taken the approach of independently validating hits from the screen using well-curated small molecules. In this manner, we identify pharmacologically tractable hits that can either increase CD14 expression on non-differentiated monocytes or prevent CD14 upregulation during macrophage differentiation. An inhibitor for one of these targets, MAP2K3, translates through to studies on primary human monocytes, where it prevents upregulation of CD14 following M-CSF induced differentiation, and pro-inflammatory cytokine production in response to LPS. Therefore, this screening cascade has rapidly identified pharmacologically tractable nodes regulating a critical disease-relevant process.","Jimenez-Duran, Gisela; Luque-Martin, Rosario; Patel, Meghana; Koppe, Emma; Bernard, Sharon; Sharp, Catriona; Buchan, Natalie; Rea, Ceara; de Winther, Menno P.J.; Turan, Nil; Angell, Davina; Wells, Christine A.; Cousins, Rick; Mander, Palwinder K.; Masters, Seth L.",EBioMedicine,572,24

Our study investigated the pathogenicity of the tissue-culture-grown PDCoV (TC-PDCoV) OH-FD22 at cell passages 5, 20 and 40 in LLC-PK cells, in eight 14-day-old gnotobiotic (Gn) pigs. Pigs (n = 3) were euthanized for pathologic examination at post-inoculation day (PID) 3, and the remainder were monitored for clinical signs, virus shedding, and serum antibody responses until PID 28. All inoculated pigs developed watery diarrhea and/or vomiting at PID 1-2 and shed the highest amount of viral RNA in feces at PID 3-5, accompanied by severe atrophic enteritis. They developed high titers of PDCoV-specific IgG/IgA and virus-neutralizing antibodies in serum at PID 23-24. Histologic lesions were limited to the villous epithelium of the jejunum and ileum at PID 3. Two inoculated pigs tested at PID 23-24 had small to moderate numbers of PDCoV antigen-positive cells in the intestinal lamina propria and mesenteric lymph nodes, but not in enterocytes. An analysis of full-length S and N genes of TC- and Gn-pig-passaged OH-FD22 revealed a high genetic stability in cell culture and pigs. TC-PDCoV OH-FD22 (cell passages 5, 20 and 40) was enteropathogenic, and the pathogenicity was similar to that of the original field virus. The TC-PDCoV OH-FD22 will be useful for further pathogenesis studies and for evaluating if higher-level cell-culture passaged virus becomes attenuated for vaccine development.","Hu, Hui; Jung, Kwonil; Vlasova, Anastasia N.; Saif, Linda J.",Arch Virol,572,16

Taxonomically, SARS-CoV-2 was shown to be a Betacoronavirus (lineage B) closely related to SARS-CoV and SARS-related bat coronaviruses, and it has been reported to share a common receptor with SARS-CoV (ACE-2). Subsequently, betacoronaviruses from pangolins were identified as close relatives to SARS-CoV-2. Here, we perform structural modeling of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. Our data provide support for the similar receptor utilization between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, despite a relatively low amino acid similarity in the receptor binding module. Compared to SARS-CoV and all other coronaviruses in Betacoronavirus lineage B, we identify an extended structural loop containing basic amino acids at the interface of the receptor binding (S1) and fusion (S2) domains. We suggest this loop confers fusion activation and entry properties more in line with betacoronaviruses in lineages A and C, and be a key component in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 with this structural loop affecting virus stability and transmission.","Jaimes, Javier A.; André, Nicole M.; Chappie, Joshua S.; Millet, Jean K.; Whittaker, Gary R.",J Mol Biol,572,26

METHODS: We assessed anxiety and depression symptoms using two validated questionnaires in 413,148 individuals between February and April 2021; 26,998 had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. We adjusted for physical and mental pre-pandemic comorbidities, BMI, age, and sex. FINDINGS: Overall, 26.4% of participants met screening criteria for general anxiety and depression. Anxiety and depression were slightly more prevalent in previously SARS-CoV-2 positive (30.4%) vs. negative (26.1%) individuals. This association was small compared to the effect of an unhealthy BMI and the presence of other comorbidities, and not evident in younger participants (≤40 years). Findings were robust to multiple sensitivity analyses.

In the first step, we identify essential proteins from virus targets or their associated modules in human cells as possible drug target candidates. For this purpose, we apply two different algorithms to detect some candidate sets of proteins with a minimum size that drive a significant disruption in the COVID-19 related biological networks. We evaluate the resulted candidate proteins sets with three groups of drugs namely Covid-Drug, Clinical-Drug, and All-Drug.

The socio-economic context of the eight South Asian countries is averse to any long-term lockdown program, but the region still observed stringent lockdown close to two months. This paper analyzed major measures in public health preparedness and responses in South Asian countries in the fight against pandemic. The research was based on a situation analysis to discuss appropriate plan for epidemic preparedness, strategies for prevention and control measures, and adequate response management mechanism. Based on the data from March 21 to June 26, 2020, it appeared that lockdown program along with other control measures were not as effective to arrest the exponential growth of fortnightly new COVID-19 cases in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan. However, Bhutan, the Maldives and Sri Lanka have been successfully managing to limit the spread of the disease. The in-depth analysis of prevention and control measures espoused that densely populated context of South Asia needs community-led intervention strategy, such as case containment strategy, in order to reverse the growing trend, and adopt the policy of mitigation instead of suppression to formulate COVID-19 action plan. On the other hand, mechanism for response management encompassed a four-tier approach of governance to weave community-led local bodies with state, national and international governance actors for enhancing the countries’ emergency operation system. It is concluded that resource-crunch countries in South Asia are unable to cope with the disproportionate demand of capital as well as skilled health care workforce at the time of the pandemic. Hence, response management needs an approach of governance maximization instead of resource maximization. The epidemiologic management of population coupled with suitable public health prevention and control measures may be a more appropriate strategy to strike a balance between economy and population health during the time of pandemic.","Sarkar, Amitabha; Liu, Guang-Qi; Jin, Yinzi; Xie, Zheng; Zheng, Zhi-Jie",Glob Health J,572,33

This paper proposes an algorithm that produces a visually coherent and meaningful cipher image. The proposed algorithm consists of a permutation-substitution subroutine to obtain a partial cipher. The Arnold-3D map does the permutation, and a delayed logistic map performs the substitution in this subroutine. The hiding of this partial cipher is done in the reference image using an integer wavelet transform. The pixels of the partial cipher are embedded in the four sub-bands of the decomposed reference image as 4 to 1-pixel encoding using Cantor-like pairing function. In addition to the lossless encryption scheme, the integer nature of all the sub-bands in the wavelet decomposition and the invertible pairing function facilitates the perfect reconstruction of the reference image. One of the significant novelty of this work lies in the subtle use of simple pairing functions, which prohibits the unnecessary increase in the size of the cipher, thereby reducing the storage and transmission costs.","Musanna, Farhan; Kumar, Sanjeev",Computer Communications,572,20

The virus establishes a success in balancing its deadliness and contagiousness, and causes substantial differences in susceptibility and disease progression in people of different ages, genders and pre-existing comorbidities. Since these host factors are subjected to epigenetic regulation, relevant analyses on some key genes underlying COVID-19 pathogenesis were performed to longitudinally decipher their epigenetic correlation to COVID-19 susceptibility. The genes of host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2, as the major virus receptor) and interleukin (IL)-6 (a key immune-pathological factor triggering cytokine storm) were shown to evince active epigenetic evolution via histone modification and cis/trans-factors interaction across different vertebrate species. Extensive analyses revealed that ACE2 ad IL-6 genes are among a subset of non-canonical interferon-stimulated genes (non-ISGs), which have been designated recently for their unconventional responses to interferons (IFNs) and inflammatory stimuli through an epigenetic cascade. Furthermore, significantly higher positive histone modification markers and position weight matrix (PWM) scores of key cis-elements corresponding to inflammatory and IFN signaling, were discovered in both ACE2 and IL6 gene promoters across representative COVID-19-susceptible species compared to unsusceptible ones. Findings characterize ACE2 and IL-6 genes as non-ISGs that respond differently to inflammatory and IFN signaling from the canonical ISGs and their epigenetic properties may serve as biomarkers to longitudinally predict COVID-19 susceptibility in vertebrates and partially explain COVID-19 inequality in people of different subgroups.","Sang, Eric R.; Tian, Yun; Miller, Laura C.; Sang, Yongming",bioRxiv,572,28

METHODS: On the basis of data collected from a literature review, the cost of glucose monitoring was modelled for patients with T2DM on a basal-bolus insulin regimen. The cost estimate included annual consumption for glucose monitoring (strips, lancets and sensors) and severe hypoglycaemic events (SHE) management. A published rate of SHE (2.5 episodes/patient-year) was considered. A reduction of SHE (− 48.8%) associated with FreeStyle Libre 2 system, derived from the REPLACE trial, was applied. Hospital attendance for 20.5% of SHEs (with subsequent hospitalization in 16.0%) was applied. Consumption of strips and lancets was set at 6/day for SMBG (derived from national monitoring recommendations), and 0.2/day for FreeStyle Libre 2 system users, with 26 FreeStyle Libre 2 sensors/year. Unitary costs (€, year 2020 excluding VAT) were derived from literature (€0.28/strip; €0.09/lancet; €3.09/daily FM sensor; €3804/hospitalized SHE; €1794/hospital-attended non-admitted SHE; €389/community-attended SHE). RESULTS: Costs were €2700 and €2120/year/patient using SMBG or FreeStyle Libre 2 system, respectively. For 1000 patients with T2DM using basal-bolus insulin, 1220 SHEs/year (with 48 hospitalizations) could be prevented and FreeSytle Libre 2 system could generate cost savings of up to €580,953/year versus SMBG (− 21.5%). CONCLUSION: FreeStyle Libre 2 system is a potential cost-saving strategy in patients with T2DM in Spain on a basal-bolus insulin regimen.","Oyagüez, Itziar; Gómez-Peralta, Fernando; Artola, Sara; Carrasco, Francisco J.; Carretero-Gómez, Juana; García-Soidan, Javier; Gómez-Huelgas, Ricardo; Merino-Torres, Juan F.; Pérez, Antonio",Diabetes Ther,572,20

Diabetes (mostly type 2 diabetes mellitus, T2DM) and hyperglycemia are among the major comorbidities in patients with COVID‐19 leading to poor outcomes. Reports show that patients with diabetes and COVID‐19 are at an increased risk for developing severe complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi‐organ failure and death. Here we explore potential mechanistic links that could explain the observed higher morbidity and mortality in this patient population. Patients with T2DM have an underlying increased level of inflammation associated with obesity and insulin resistance in addition to other comorbidities including HTN, obesity, CVD, dyslipidemia and being older. We review evidence that T2DM with hyperglycemia are among factors that lead to elevated expression of ACE2 in lungs and other tissues; ACE2 is the cellular “receptor” and port of viral entry. The pre‐existing chronic inflammation with augmented inflammatory response to the infection and the increasing viral load leads to extreme systemic immune response (“cytokine storm”) that is strongly associated with increased severity of COVID‐19. Based on the available evidence, it is recommended by a panel of experts that safe but stringent control of blood glucose, blood pressure and lipids be carried out in patients with T2DM, measures that could potentially serve to decrease the severity of COVID‐19 should these patients contract the viral infection. Once the infection occurs, then attention should be directed to proper glycemic control with use of insulin and frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels.","Rajpal, Aman; Rahimi, Leili; Ismail‐Beigi, Faramarz",J Diabetes,572,30

While its typical clinical manifestations are respiratory disorders, emerging evidence of cardiovascular complications indicates the adverse interaction between SARS-CoV-2 infection and cardiovascular outcomes. Given that viral infection has emerged as an additional risk factor for atherosclerosis, in this paper, we attempt to clarify the susceptibility to new-onset atherosclerosis in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2. Mechanistically, serving as functional receptors for SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) mediates SARS-CoV-2 infection of endothelial cells (ECs) directly, leading to endothelial dysfunction and dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). In addition, high expression of CD147, an alternative receptor, and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome may also contribute to atherosclerosis in the context of COVID-19. More importantly, SARS-CoV-2 attacks the immune system, which results in excessive inflammation and perpetuates a vicious cycle of deteriorated endothelial dysfunction that further promotes inflammation. The alterations in the blood lipid profile induced by COVID-19 should not be ignored in assessing the predisposition toward atherosclerosis in victims of COVID-19. A better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the long-term monitoring of inflammatory factors and endothelial function should be considered in the follow-up of patients who have recovered from COVID-19 for early detection and prevention of atherosclerosis.","Liu, Ya; Zhang, Hai-Gang",Front Med (Lausanne),572,1

Objective We sought to determine whether maternal asthma is associated with higher odds of infant respiratory tract infection with rhinovirus versus RSV and increased infection severity. Methods Mother-infant dyads were enrolled from 2004-2008 during an infant respiratory tract infection (104 with rhinovirus and 279 with RSV). Mothers were classified into mutually exclusive groups (atopic asthma, nonatopic asthma, and no asthma). We determined viral cause using PCR and the severity of the infant’s respiratory tract infection using the bronchiolitis severity score. Adjusted relative odds of maternal asthma with viral cause were calculated by using logistic regression. Proportional odds models assessed the association of maternal asthma and infant infection severity. Results Infants with a mother with atopic asthma compared with infants whose mothers did not have asthma were more likely to have rhinovirus versus RSV infection (adjusted odds ratio, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.19-4.90). Similarly, among infants with rhinovirus, having a mother with atopic asthma was associated with increased infection severity (adjusted odds ratio, 3.10; 95% CI, 1.21-7.98). This relationship was not seen among infants with RSV. Conclusions Clinically significant rhinovirus infection during infancy was more strongly associated with having a mother with atopic asthma than clinically significant RSV infection. Having a mother with atopic asthma was associated with increased severity of infant rhinovirus but not RSV infections. Infants with rhinovirus were more likely to have a familial atopic predisposition, which might partly explain the subsequent increased asthma risk.","Carroll, Kecia N.; Gebretsadik, Tebeb; Minton, Patricia; Woodward, Kimberly; Liu, Zhouwen; Miller, E.

Italy has the highest rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the highest number of deaths, and the highest mortality rate among large countries. Worldwide, a more severe course of COVID-19 is associated with older age, comorbidities, and male sex. Hence, we searched for possible genetic components of the peculiar severity of COVID-19 among Italians, by looking at expression levels and variants in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes, which are crucial for viral infection. Methods: Exome and SNP array data from a large Italian cohort representative of the country's population were used to compare the burden of rare variants and the frequency of polymorphisms with European and East Asian populations. Moreover, we looked into gene expression databases to check for sex-unbalanced expression. Results: While we found no significant evidence that ACE2 is associated with disease severity/sex bias in the Italian population, TMPRSS2 levels and genetic variants proved to be possible candidate disease modulators, contributing to the observed epidemiological data among Italian patients. Conclusions: Our analysis suggests a role for TMPRSS2 variants and expression levels in modulating COVID-19 severity, a hypothesis that fosters a rapid experimental validation on large cohorts of patients with different clinical manifestations.","Asselta, R.; Paraboschi, E.

The binding of SARS-CoV spike (S) protein to cellular angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the first step in SARS-CoV infection. Therefore, we assayed the inhibitory effects of small peptides derived from S protein on the binding of S protein to ACE2 and on the S-protein-pseudotyped retrovirus infectivity. SP-4 (residues 192–203), SP-8 (residues 483–494), and SP-10 (residues 668–679) significantly blocked the interaction between S protein and ACE2 by biotinylated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, with IC(50) values of 4.30 ± 2.18, 6.99 ± 0.71, and 1.88 ± 0.52 nmol, respectively. Peptide scanning suggested the region spanning residues 660–683 might act as a receptor-binding domain. SP-10 blocked both binding of the S protein and infectivity of S protein-pseudotyped retrovirus to Vero E6 cells. In conclusion, this is the first report of small peptides designed to disrupt the binding of SARS-CoV S protein to ACE2. Our findings suggest that SP-10 may be developed as an anti-SARS-CoV agent for the treatment of SARS-CoV infection.","Ho, Tin-Yun; Wu, Shih-Lu; Chen, Jaw-Chyun; Wei, Yen-Chiao; Cheng, Shin-Ei; Chang, Yung-Hsien; Liu, Hsu-Jan; Hsiang, Chien-Yun",Antiviral Res,572,20

Typical CBD symptoms include stunting due to internodal shortening, leaf rolling, intense green foliage, and yellowing veins. Atypical CBD symptoms, including reddish and withered leaves, were also observed in Brazilian cotton fields in 2007. Recently, a Polerovirus named Cotton leafroll dwarf virus (CLRDV) was shown to be associated with CBD. RESULTS: To understand the distribution and genetic diversity of CLRDV in Brazil, we analyzed 23 CBD-symptomatic plants from susceptible cotton varieties originating from five of the six most important cotton-growing states, from 2004–2007. Here, we report on CLRDV diversity in plants with typical or atypical CBD symptoms by comparing viral coat protein, RNA polymerase (RdRp), and intergenic region genomic sequences. CONCLUSION: The virus had a widespread distribution with a low genetic diversity; however, three divergent isolates were associated with atypical CBD symptoms. These divergent isolates had a CLRDV-related coat protein but a distinct RdRp sequence, and probably arose from recombination events. Based on the taxonomic rules for the family Luteoviridae, we propose that these three isolates represent isolates of a new species in the genus Polerovirus.","Silva, TF; Corrêa, RL; Castilho, Y; Silvie, P; Bélot, J-L; Vaslin, MFS",Virol J,572,1

In respiratory viruses they inhibit the replication of orthomyxoviridae and paramyxoviridae at a post-translational level. Nitazoxanide 1a, the prototype thiazolide, was originally developed as an antiparasitic agent and later repurposed for the treatment of viral respiratory infections. The second generation thiazolides following nitazoxanide, such as the 5-chloro analogue RM-5038 2a, are also broad-spectrum antiviral agents as we have reported. Both 1a and its effective circulating metabolite, tizoxanide 1b, are 5-nitrothiazole derivatives, while RM-5038 2a and its de-acetyl derivative RM-4848 2b are the corresponding 5-chloro derivatives. Recently 1a has completed phase II-III clinical trials in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand in a total of 2865 adults and adolescents of at least 12 months of age with viral acute respiratory illness. Since its biodisposition is primarily seen in the gastro-intestinal tract, its efficacy in systemic viral diseases requires relatively high oral doses. The chemical synthesis of new derivatives with a better systemic absorption was therefore urgently needed. In order to improve their systemic absorption, new amino-ester prodrug derivatives of 1b and RM4848 2b were prepared and tested for their animal pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology. RM-5061 8a in rats showed 7-fold higher blood concentration compared to 1a: absolute bioavailability increased from 3 to 20%, with a good safety profile in animal safety pharmacology and toxicology.","Stachulski, Andrew V.; Swift, Karl; Cooper, Mark; Reynolds, Stephen; Norton, Daniel; Slonecker, Steven D.; Rossignol, Jean-François",Eur J Med Chem,572,33

The risk of within-household infection is greatly increased among those from Black Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) and low income communities. Efforts to protect these communities are urgently needed. The aim of this study is to explore the acceptability of the availability of accommodation to support isolation among at risk populations. Methods Our study used a mixed methods design structured in two phases. In phase 1, we conducted a survey study of a sample of volunteers from our existing database of 300 individuals who had provided consent to be contacted about ongoing research projects into infection control. In phase 2, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 19 participants from BAME communities and low income communities recruited through social media. Results Participants from the survey and interview phase of the study viewed the provision of accommodation as important and necessary. Factors influencing likely uptake of accommodation included perceived 1) vulnerability of household 2) exposure to the virus and 3) options for isolation at home. Barriers to accepting the offer of accommodation included 1) being able to isolate at home 2) wanting to be with family 3) caring responsibilities 4) concerns about mental wellbeing 5) upheaval of moving when ill and 6) concerns about infection control. Participants raised a series of issues that should be addressed before accommodation is offered. These included questions regarding who should use temporary accommodation and at what stage to effectively reduce transmission in the home, and how infection control in temporary accommodation would be managed. Conclusion This research provides evidence that the provision of accommodation to prevent within household transmission of the virus is viewed as acceptable, feasible and necessary by many people who are concerned about infection transmission in the home. We explore ways in which accommodation might be offered. In particular, vulnerable members of the household could be protected if accommodation is offered to individuals who are informed through test trace and isolate that they have been in contact with the virus.","Denford, Sarah; Morton, Kate S; Horwood, Jeremy; Garang, Rachel de; Yardley, Lucy",,572,5

These VoC are associated with higher transmissibility rates and in some cases, increased mortality. In this work we present a national wastewater survey of the distribution of three SARS-CoV-2 mutations found in the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 VoC, namely the S-gene 69-70 deletion, N501Y mutation, and N-gene D3L. RT-qPCR allelic discrimination assays were sufficiently sensitive and specific for detection and relative quantitation of SARS-CoV-2 variants in wastewater to allow for rapid population-level screening and surveillance. We tested 261 samples collected from 5 Canadian cities (Vancouver, Edmonton, Toronto, Montreal, and Halifax) and 6 communities in the Northwest Territories from February 16th to March 28th, 2021. VoC were not detected in the Territorial communities, suggesting the absence of VoC SARS-CoV-2 cases in those communities. Percentage of variant remained low throughout the study period in the majority of the sites tested, however the Toronto sites showed a marked increase from ~25% to ~75% over the study period. The results of this study highlight the utility of population level molecular surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 VoC using wastewater. Wastewater monitoring for VoC can be a powerful tool in informing public health responses, including monitoring trends independent of clinical surveillance and providing early warning to communities.","Peterson, S.

To understand the early evolutionary events following its emergence, a dataset of 985 complete SARS-CoV-2 sequences was assembled. Variants showed a mean 5.5-9.5 nucleotide differences from each other, commensurate with a mid-range coronavirus substitution rate of 3×10−4 substitutions/site/year. Almost half of sequence changes were C->U transitions with an 8-fold base frequency normalised directional asymmetry between C->U and U->C substitutions. Elevated ratios were observed in other recently emerged coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) and to a decreasing degree in other human coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63, -OC43, -229E and -HKU1) proportionate to their increasing divergence. C->U transitions underpinned almost half of the amino acid differences between SARS-CoV-2 variants, and occurred preferentially in both 5’U/A and 3’U/A flanking sequence contexts comparable to favoured motifs of human APOBEC3 proteins. Marked base asymmetries observed in non-pandemic human coronaviruses (U>>A>G>>C) and low G+C contents may represent long term effects of prolonged C->U hypermutation in their hosts. Importance The evidence that much of sequence change in SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses may be driven by a host APOBEC-like editing process has profound implications for understanding their short and long term evolution. Repeated cycles of mutation and reversion in favoured mutational hotspots and the widespread occurrence of amino acid changes with no adaptive value for the virus represents a quite different paradigm of virus sequence change from neutral and Darwinian evolutionary frameworks that are typically used in molecular epidemiology investigations.","Simmonds, P.",bioRxiv,572,29

Patients' affective temperaments were assessed with the 39-item form of the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris, and San Diego (TEMPS-A-39) and emotional dysregulation with the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS). Patients were divided in two samples according to their scores on the K10, i.e., a high likelihood of psychological distress group (N = 18) and a low likelihood of psychological distress group (N = 43).

However, a comprehensive examination of monocyte numbers and function has not been performed longitudinally in acute and convalescent COVID-19. We examined the absolute counts of monocytes, the frequency of monocyte subsets, the plasma levels of monocyte activation markers using flowcytometry and ELISA in seven groups of COVID-19 individuals, classified based on days since RT-PCR confirmation of SARS-CoV2 infection. Our data shows that the absolute counts of total monocytes and the frequencies of intermediate and non-classical monocytes increases from Days 15–30 to Days 61–90 and plateau thereafter. In contrast, the frequency of classical monocytes decreases from Days 15–30 till Days 121–150. The plasma levels of sCD14, CRP, sCD163 and sTissue Factor (sTF)—all decrease from Days 15–30 till Days 151–180. COVID-19 patients with severe disease exhibit higher levels of monocyte counts and higher frequencies of classical monocytes and lower frequencies of intermediate and non-classical monocytes and elevated plasma levels of sCD14, CRP, sCD163 and sTF in comparison with mild disease. Thus, our study provides evidence of dynamic alterations in monocyte counts, subset frequencies and activation status in acute and convalescent COVID-19 individuals.","Rajamanickam, Anuradha; Kumar, Nathella Pavan; Pandiarajan, Arul Nancy; Selvaraj, Nandhini; Munisankar, Saravanan; Renji, Rachel Mariam; Venkatramani, Vijayalakshmi; Murhekar, Manoj; Thangaraj, Jeromie W.

Methods: We collected data on COVID-19 cases confirmed by laboratory tests during the first two waves of the pandemic (1 March to 15 July and 16 July to 30 November, 2020) in Barcelona. For each wave and sex, we calculated smooth cumulative incidence by census tract using a hierarchical Bayesian model. We analyzed income inequalities in the incidence of COVID-19, categorizing the census tracts into quintiles based on the income indicator. Results: During the two waves, women showed higher COVID-19 cumulative incidence under 64 years, while the trend was reversed after that threshold. The incidence of the disease was higher in some poor neighborhoods. The risk ratio (RR) increased in the poorest groups compared to the richest ones, mainly in the second wave, with RR being 1.67 (95% Credible Interval-CI-: 1.41–1.96) in the fifth quintile income group for men and 1.71 (95% CI: 1.44–1.99) for women.

METHODS: Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 members, residing mostly in Edinburgh and the surrounding Lothians regions in Scotland, mean age 84 years (SD = 0.3), responded to an online questionnaire in May 2020 (n = 190). We examined responses (experience and knowledge of COVID-19; adherence to guidance; impact on day-to-day living; social contact; self-reported physical and mental health; loneliness; and lifestyle) and relationships between previously-measured characteristics and questionnaire outcomes. RESULTS: Four respondents experienced COVID-19; most had good COVID-19 knowledge (94.7%) and found guidance easy to understand (86.3%). There were modest declines in self-reported physical and mental health, and 48.2% did less physical activity.

Preconditioning MSCs with hypoxia-inducible factors-α (HIFα) stabilizers is an alternative to hypoxic priming, but there remains insufficient data evaluating its transcriptomic effect. Herein, we determined the gene expression profile of 6 human bone marrow-derived MSCs preconditioned for 6 h in 2% O(2) (hypoxia) or with 40 μM Vadadustat, compared to control cells and each other. RNA-Sequencing was performed using the Illumina platform, quality control with FastQC and adapter-trimming with BBDUK2. Transcripts were mapped to the Homo_sapiens. GRCh37 genome and converted to relative expression using Salmon. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were generated using DESeq2 while functional enrichment was performed in GSEA and g:Profiler. Comparison of hypoxia versus control resulted in 250 DEGs, Vadadustat versus control 1071, and Vadadustat versus hypoxia 1770. The terms enriched in both phenotypes referred mainly to metabolism, in Vadadustat additionally to vesicular transport, chromatin modifications and interaction with extracellular matrix. Compared with hypoxia, Vadadustat upregulated autophagic, phospholipid metabolism, and TLR cascade genes, downregulated those of cytoskeleton and GG-NER pathway and regulated 74 secretory factor genes. Our results provide valuable insight into the transcriptomic effects of these two methods of MSCs preconditioning.","Zielniok, Katarzyna; Burdzinska, Anna; Murcia Pienkowski, Victor; Koppolu, Agnieszka; Rydzanicz, Malgorzata; Zagozdzon, Radoslaw; Paczek, Leszek",Int J Mol Sci,572,6

As an organism ages its immune system undergoes immunosenescence, characterized by declined performance or malfunction in either immune branch, which can lead to disease and death. In this study we develop a mathematical framework of coupled innate and adaptive immune responses, namely the integrated immune branch (IIB) model. This model describes dynamics of immune components in both branches, uses a shape-space representation to encode pathogen-specific immune memory, and exhibits three steady states— health, septic death, and chronic inflammation— qualitatively similar to clinically-observed immune outcomes. In this model, the immune system (initialized in the health state) is subjected to a sequence of pathogen encounters, and we use the number of prior pathogen encounters as a proxy for the “age” of the immune system. We find that repeated pathogen encounters may trigger a fragility in which any encounter with a novel pathogen will cause the system to irreversibly switch from health to chronic inflammation. This transition is consistent with the onset of “inflammaging”, a condition observed in aged individuals who experience chronic low-grade inflammation even in the absence of pathogens. The IIB model predicts that the onset of chronic inflammation strongly depends on the history of encountered pathogens; the timing of onset differs drastically when the same set of infections occurs in a different order. Lastly, the coupling between the innate and adaptive immune branches generates a trade-off between rapid pathogen clearance and a delayed onset of immunosenescence. Overall, by considering the complex feedback between immune compartments, our work suggests potential mechanisms for immunosenescence and provides a theoretical framework at the system level and on the scale of an organism’s lifetime to account for clinical observations.","Jones, Eric; Sheng, Jiming; Carlson, Jean; Wang, Shenshen",J Theor Biol,572,26

Such methods can be problematic if the folding of the antigenic protein is incorrect. To avoid this problem, we propose a method based on grafting specific regions of the chosen antigenic protein onto biocompatible polymeric matrices, so that they can mimic portions of the antigenic protein. These regions are selected following the criterion according to which they are not folded, are exposed to the solvent and are not already present in the human body, so that they are not recognized by the immune system as self. Regions are selected using the primary sequence of the protein and, where possible, its tertiary structure.

Many of the most radical measures were adopted in Henan province, immediately north of Hubei, the pandemic’s epicentre in China. However, little is known about how rural residents—a group systematically disadvantaged in Chinese society—responded to authorities’ draconian restrictions. METHODS: To understand the lockdown measures and rural community responses at the grassroots level, face-to-face interviewers were conducted with both village cadres and villagers from two Henan villages in May and June 2020. The interviews were analysed with qualitative content analysis methods, with the coding process guided by the concepts of resilience, vulnerability and adaptability from the literature on disaster risk reduction. RESULTS: We found that the lockdown measures were indeed radical and disproportionate relative to the level of risk presented; however, they were largely accepted by villagers. This contradiction can be explained by two key contributing factors: (i) shared interests of individual villagers and the converged goal of government and civil society, and (ii) tacit flexibility in COVID-19 adaption strategies to tackle conflict resulting from goal diversion between citizens and local governments. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the nuances of ground-level politics. Despite their ‘radical’ nature, the lockdown measures were not implemented as simple top-down coercion. Instead, they involved, importantly, the bottom-up, localised response of villagers, and they were negotiated and adapted according to local circumstances.","Tan, Xiao; Song, Yao; Liu, Tianyang",PLoS One,572,21

Our objective was to describe cluster-associated mumps virus transmission using epidemiological and molecular information in order to help future mumps outbreak investigation and control efforts. METHODS: An epidemiological cluster includes ≥ 2 mumps cases with at least an epidemiological-link to a laboratory-confirmed mumps case. A molecular group includes ≥ 2 mumps cases with identical mumps virus sequences. Cases with symptom onset date between 1 October 2019 and 31 March 2020 reported through the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System were included. We described epidemiological and clinical characteristics of mumps cases. Sequence data was obtained from selected regions of mumps virus genomes (2270 nucleotides). Associations between epidemiological and molecular information were investigated. RESULTS: In total, 102 mumps cases were notified (90% laboratory-confirmed, 10% epidemiologically-linked). 71 out of 102 cases were identified as part of an epidemiological cluster and/or molecular group. Twenty-one (30%) of 71 cases were identified solely from epidemiological information, 25 (35%) solely from molecular surveillance, and 25 (35%) using both. Fourteen epidemiological clusters were identified containing a total of 46 (range: 2–12, median: 3) cases. Complete sequence data was obtained from 50 mumps genotype G viruses. Twelve molecular groups were identified containing 43 (range: 2–13) cases, dispersed geographically and timewise. Combined information grouped seven epidemiological clusters into two distinct molecular groups. The first lasting for 14 weeks, the other for 6. Additionally, one molecular group was detected, linked by geography and time but without an epidemiological-link. CONCLUSIONS: Combined epidemiological and molecular information indicated ongoing mumps virus transmission from multiple introductions for extended time periods. Sequence analysis provided valuable insights into epidemiological clustering.

Our aim is to predict the impact of the compulsory containment on COVID-19 spread. Earlier knowledge of the epidemic characteristics of COVID-19 transmission related to Morocco will be of great interest to establish an optimal plan-of-action to control the epidemic. Method: Using a Susceptible-Asymptomatic-Infectious model and the data of reported cumulative confirmed cases in Morocco from March 2nd to April 9, 2020, we determined the basic and control reproduction numbers and we estimated the model parameter values. Furthermore, simulations of different scenarios of containment are performed. Results: Epidemic characteristics are predicted according to different rates of containment. The basic reproduction number is estimated to be 2.9949, with CI(2.6729-3.1485). Furthermore, a threshold value of containment rate, below which the epidemic duration is postponed, is determined. Conclusion: Our findings show that the basic reproduction number reflects a high speed of spread of the epidemic. Furthermore, the compulsory containment can be efficient if more than 73% of population are confined. However, even with 90% of containment, the end-time is estimated to happen on July 4th which can be harmful and lead to consequent social-economic damages. Thus, containment need to be accompanied by other measures such as mass testing to reduce the size of asymptomatic population. Indeed, our sensitivity analysis investigation shows that the COVID-19 dynamics depends strongly on the asymptomatic duration as well as the contact and containment rates. Our results can help the Moroccan government to anticipate the spread of COVID-19 and avoid human loses and consequent social-economic damages as well.","Hammoumi, A.; Qesmi, R.",,572,1

With no vaccines, and only recently developed antiviral therapeutics, we are ill equipped to handle coronavirus outbreaks(4). A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate coronavirus replication and pathogenesis is needed to guide the development of new antiviral therapeutics and vaccines. RNA secondary structures play critical roles in multiple aspects of coronavirus replication, but the extent and conservation of RNA secondary structure across coronavirus genomes is unknown(5). Here, we define highly structured RNA regions throughout the MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 genomes. We find that highly stable RNA structures are pervasive throughout coronavirus genomes, and are conserved between the SARS-like CoV. Our data suggests that selective pressure helps preserve RNA secondary structure in coronavirus genomes, suggesting that these structures may play important roles in virus replication and pathogenesis. Thus, disruption of conserved RNA secondary structures could be a novel strategy for the generation of attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for use against the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Sanders, Wes; Fritch, Ethan J.; Madden, Emily A.; Graham, Rachel L.; Vincent, Heather A.; Heise, Mark T.; Baric, Ralph S.; Moorman, Nathaniel J.",bioRxiv,572,1

The investigated nonchemotherapy options include moxetumomab pasudotox, which targets CD22; vemurafenib or dabrafenib, which target the BRAFV600E protein; trametinib, which targets mitogen-activated protein kinase enzyme; and ibrutinib, which targets Bruton tyrosine kinase. SUMMARY: Purine analogs significantly improve survival in patients with HCL. However, patients often relapse, require multiple treatments, and may become refractory.

The impact of COVID-19 on TB control in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is little known. Methods: Based on the national TB Information Management System (TBIMS), this study accessed the actual impact of COVID-19 on TB by comparing TB notifications, pre-treatment delays, and clinical characteristics of TB cases between 2020 COVID-19 period and 2017–2019 baseline. The data were divided into three periods based on the response started to fight against COVID-19 in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, including the control period (10 weeks before the pandemic), intensive period (10 weeks during the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region lockdown), and regular (10 additional weeks after Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region reopen). Results: TB notification dropped sharply in the first week of the intensive period but took significantly longer to return to the previous level in 2020 compared with the 2017–2019 baseline. Totally, the TB notification rates decreased by more than 60% in the intensive period of COVID-19 compared with the average level of 2017–2019. The sputum smear-positive rate of TB patients diagnosed in intensive period of COVID-19 was significantly higher than that in the corresponding periods of 2017–2019 (P < 0.001). The rate of cavity on X-ray inspection of TB cases diagnosed in the intensive period of COVID-19 was significantly higher than that in period 2 of 2017–2019 (23.5 vs. 15.4%, P = 0.004). The patients' delay in the intensive period was significantly longer than that before the pandemic (P = 0.047). Conclusions: The TB notification in Ningxia was impacted dramatically by the pandemic of COVID-19. To compensate for the large numbers of missed diagnosis as well as delayed diagnosis during the intensive period of COVID-19, an urgent restoration of normal TB services, and further emphasis on enhanced active case finding and scale-up of household contact tracing and screening for TB-related symptoms or manifestation, will be essential.","Wang, Xiaolin; He, Wencong; Lei, Juan; Liu, Guangtian; Huang, Fei; Zhao, Yanlin",Front Public Health,572,28

However, research is needed to assess value, patient satisfaction, and clinical outcomes in the delivery of telehealth PT. PURPOSES: We sought to compare patient satisfaction with in-person and telehealth PT and to determine the factors—such as age, gender, or insurance payer—that contributed to patient satisfaction scores. METHODS: Patients between the ages of 18 and 90 years who received outpatient PT at our institution were texted a patient satisfaction survey. Surveys were sent to patients who received in-person PT from January 1 to May 8, 2020, and to patients who received telehealth PT from April 21 to May 8, 2020. Patients’ age, gender, insurance payer, and written comments were also collected. Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare survey scores between groups. χ-squared tests were used to compare categorical patient characteristics between groups. RESULTS: In total, 12,345 surveys were sent out. We included completed surveys from 1147 patients in the analysis. Of these, 33% identified as male and 67% as female, mean age was 60.3 years, 58% had commercial insurance, 36% had Medicare, 3% had Medicaid, 2% had no-fault/worker’s compensation, and 1% had international insurance. The question of satisfaction was answered by 1074 patients. No statistical difference in satisfaction was seen in age or gender groups. Satisfaction differed by insurance type, but when analysis excluded patients with international insurance, there was no difference between groups. In-person PT patients reported higher satisfaction in achieving treatment goals, as rated on a 1-to-5 scale (4.7 ± 0.6), than telehealth PT patients (4.6 ± 0.6), although it is unclear if this result is clinically meaningful. There was no significant difference in the remaining follow-up questions. CONCLUSION: We found no overall difference in patient satisfaction between those receiving in-person PT and those receiving telehealth PT. This was true for initial and follow-up visits, with the exception of two categories: the “ability of scheduling an appointment” and “progress towards attaining your treatment goals.” However, the clinical significance of these two exceptions is questionable. Ongoing research is indicated to evaluate the efficacy of telehealth PT while identifying the best patients and conditions for use during non-crisis times. Future studies should determine the effect of telehealth PT on patient-reported outcome measures, function, and value.

System efficiency depends on information exchange that occur on synchronous and asynchronous platforms. Traditional synchronous methods of communication may pose risks to workflow integrity and contribute to inefficient service delivery and medical care. AIM: To compare synchronous methods of communication to Medic Bleep, an instant messaging asynchronous platform, and observe its impact on clinical workflow, quality of work life and associations with patient safety outcomes and hospital core operations. METHODS: Cohorts of healthcare professionals were followed using the Time Motion Study methodology over a 2-week period, using both the asynchronous platform and the synchronous methods like the non-cardiac pager. Questionnaires and interviews were conducted to identify staff attitudes towards both platforms. RESULTS: A statistically significant figure (p<0.01) of 20.1 minutes’ reduction in average task completion was seen with asynchronous communication, saving 58.8% of time when compared with traditional synchronous methods. In subcategory analysis for staff: doctors, nurses and midwifery categories, a p value of <0.0495 and <0.01 were observed; a mean time reduction with statistical significance was also seen in specific task efficiencies of ‘To-Take-Out (TTO), patient review, discharge & patient transfer and escalation of care & procedure’. The platform was favoured with an average Likert value of 8.7; 67% found it easy to implement. CONCLUSION: The asynchronous platform improved clinical communication compared with synchronous methods, contributing to efficiencies in workflow and may positively affect patient care.","Jhala, Meenakshi; Menon, Rahul",BMJ Innov,572,8

The H(III) mice, when compared to their L(III) mice counterparts, were susceptible to MHV3 infection showing higher virus titres in the liver and peritoneal exudate, comparable IFN alpha/beta or IFN gamma titres in the peritoneal exudate or in the serum, and higher levels of PCA of PEC and SC. A higher virus titre was detected in the supernatants of H(III) mouse macrophages infected with MHV3. The activation of H(III) mouse macrophages with LPS, IFN alpha/beta or IFN gamma, in contrast to that of L(III) mouse macrophages, did not induce an antiviral effect with partial restriction of the MHV3 replication. The LPS antiviral activity was shown to be partially exerted by IFN alpha/beta synthesis. The IFN gamma was shown to be more effective in inducing an antiviral state in L(III) macrophages, when compared to IFN alpha/beta. The data obtained are consistent with the notion that the resistance mechanisms to the MHV3 infection involve the PCA and the sensitivity of macrophages to IFN.","Vassão, R. C.; Mello, I. G.

However, arrhythmia manifestations and treatment strategies used in these patients have not been well-described. We sought to better understand the cardiac arrhythmic manifestations and treatment strategies in hospitalized COVID-19 patients through a worldwide cross-sectional survey. METHODS: The Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) sent an online survey (via SurveyMonkey) to electrophysiology (EP) professionals (physicians, scientists, and allied professionals) across the globe. The survey was active from March 27 to April 13, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 1197 respondents completed the survey with 50% of respondents from outside the USA, representing 76 countries and 6 continents. Of respondents, 905 (76%) reported having COVID-19-positive patients in their hospital. Atrial fibrillation was the most commonly reported tachyarrhythmia whereas severe sinus bradycardia and complete heart block were the most common bradyarrhythmias. Ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation arrest and pulseless electrical activity were reported by 4.8% and 5.6% of respondents, respectively. There were 140 of 631 (22.2%) respondents who reported using anticoagulation therapy in all COVID-19-positive patients who did not otherwise have an indication. One hundred fifty-five of 498 (31%) reported regular use of hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine (HCQ) + azithromycin (AZM); concomitant use of AZM was more common in the USA. Sixty of 489 respondents (12.3%) reported having to discontinue therapy with HCQ + AZM due to significant QTc prolongation and 20 (4.1%) reported cases of Torsade de Pointes in patients on HCQ/chloroquine and AZM. Amiodarone was the most common antiarrhythmic drug used for ventricular arrhythmia management. CONCLUSIONS: In this global survey of > 1100 EP professionals regarding hospitalized COVID-19 patients, a variety of arrhythmic manifestations were observed, ranging from benign to potentially life-threatening. Observed adverse events related to use of HCQ + AZM included prolonged QTc requiring drug discontinuation as well as Torsade de Pointes. Large prospective studies to better define arrhythmic manifestations as well as the safety of treatment strategies in COVID-19 patients are warranted.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) related coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), on the other hand, is predominantly characterized by acute respiratory failure, although other organ complications can occur. Both infectious diseases have in common that hyperinflammation with a cytokine storm can occur. While microbial detection of C. canimorsus in blood cultures can take over 48 h, diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 is facilitated by a widely available rapid antigen diagnostic test (Ag-RDT) the results of which are available within half an hour. These Ag-RDT results are commonly verified by a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), whose results are only available after a further 24 h. CASE PRESENTATION: A 68-year-old male patient with the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia was referred to our Intensive Care Unit (ICU) from another hospital after testing positive on an Ag-RDT. While the initial therapy was focused on COVID-19, the patient developed a fulminant septic shock within a few hours after admission to the ICU, unresponsive to maximum treatment. SARS-CoV-2 NAATs were negative, but bacteremia of C. canimorsus was diagnosed post-mortem. Further anamnestic information suggest that a small skin injury caused by a dog leash or the subsequent contact of this injury with the patient’s dog could be the possible point of entry for these bacteria. CONCLUSION: During the acute phase of hyperinflammation and cytokine storm, laboratory results can resemble both, sepsis of bacterial origin or SARS-CoV-2. This means that even in the light of a global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, where this diagnosis provides the most salient train of thoughts, differential diagnoses must be considered. Ag-RDT can contribute to early detection of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, but false-positive results may cause fixation errors with severe consequences for patient outcome.","Meyer, Eva Christina; Alt-Epping, Sabine; Moerer, Onnen; Büttner, Benedikt",BMC Infect Dis,572,24

Although little is known about the virus, an examination of the genome sequence shows strong homology with its better‐studied cousin, SARS‐CoV. The spike protein used for host cell infection shows key nonsynonymous mutations that might hamper the efficacy of previously developed therapeutics but remains a viable target for the development of biologics and macrocyclic peptides. Other key drug targets, including RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase and coronavirus main proteinase (3CLpro), share a strikingly high (>95 %) homology to SARS‐CoV.

Objectives: To confirm this, using conventional and molecular detection methods, and expanding the study to younger children. Study design: One hundred and thirty-two nasal aspirates from 75 children hospitalized for a severe attack of asthma were studied (32 infants, mean age 9.1 months; and 43 children, mean age 5.6 years). According to the virus, a viral isolation technique, immunofluorescence assays (IFA) or both were used for the detection of rhinovirus, enterovirus, respiratory syncytial (RS) virus, adenovirus, coronavirus 229E, influenza and parainfluenza virus. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were used for the detection of rhinovirus, enterovirus, RS virus, adenovirus, coronavirus 229E and OC43, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Results: Using IFA and viral isolation techniques, viruses were detected in 33.3% of cases, and by PCR techniques, nucleic acid sequences of virus, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were obtained in 71.9% of cases. The combination of conventional and molecular techniques detects 81.8% of positive samples. Two organisms were identified in the same nasal sample in 20.4% of the cases. The percentage of detections was higher (85.9%) in the younger group than in the other (77%). The most frequently detected agents were rhinovirus (46.9%) and RS virus (21.2%). Using PCR rather than conventional techniques, the detection rates were increased 5.8- and 1.6-fold in rhinovirus and RS virus infections, respectively. The detection levels of the other organisms are as follows: 9.8, 5.1, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 3.7, and 2.2% for enterovirus, influenza virus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, adenovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, respectively. Conclusion: These results confirm the previously reported high frequency of rhinovirus detection in asthmatic exacerbations in children. They also point out the frequency of RS virus detection, and emphasize the fact that PCR assays may be necessary to diagnose respiratory infections in asthma.","Freymuth, François; Vabret, Astrid; Brouard, Jacques; Toutain, Fabienne; Verdon, Renaud; Petitjean, Joelle; Gouarin, Stéphanie; Duhamel, Jean-François; Guillois, Bernard",J Clin Virol,572,1

A strong focus on efficiency, productivity and accountability arising from these approaches has been well documented in the literature. Reductions in government funding have caused universities to become more competitive and entrepreneurial. However, little is known about the impacts of these changes on the working lives of individual academics. This paper is part of an ongoing study exploring the lived experiences of 2526 Australian academics who responded to a national questionnaire. This paper builds on earlier work by holistically drawing together the earlier findings which separately analysed the teaching, research and administration/service aspects of their work. In examining the effectiveness of universities through the ability of their academics to undertake their roles, we found the voices of academics that need to be heard in the development and implementation of key policies, such as academic workload and performance, to preserve the essentially self-managed nature of their work. By combining the learning from the project through the literature review, the statistical analysis and themes from the open-ended questions, we developed a set of principles to underpin these policies in universities. These principles can guide universities to shift towards a more collaborative working relationship with academics, based on trust, and actively encourage them to play be more active in institutional decision-making, especially in relation to policies that directly affect their work. These results have implications for improving the productivity of academics and the institutions in which they work.","Kenny, John; Fluck, Andrew Edward",High Educ (Dordr),572,16

In the recovery phases of the pandemic, non‐urgent medical care is resumed, but there is a lack of guidance for restarting and safely conducting motility and function testing. Breath tests and insertion of manometry and pH monitoring probes carry a risk for SARS‐CoV‐2 spread through droplet formation. METHODS: A panel of experts from the European Society for Neurogastroenterology and Motility (ESNM) evaluated emerging national and single center recommendations to provide the best current evidence and a pragmatic approach to ensure the safe conduct of motility and function testing for both healthcare professionals and patients. RESULTS: At a general level, this involves evaluation of the urgency of the procedure, evaluation of the infectious risk associated with the patient, the investigation and the health care professional(s) involved, provision of the test planning and test units, education and training of staff and use of personnel protection equipment. Additional guidance is provided for specific procedures such as esophageal manometry, pH monitoring and breath tests. CONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES: The ESNM guidelines provide pragmatic and appropriate guidance for the safe conduct of motility and function testing in the COVID‐19 pandemic and early recovery phase.","Tack, Jan; Vanuytsel, Tim; Serra, Jordi; Accarino, Anna; Stanghellini, Vincenzo; Barbara, Giovanni",Neurogastroenterol Motil,572,33

During its first 10 years (2006–2015), NCIRD worked with partners to improve preparedness and response to pandemic influenza and other emergent respiratory infections, provide an evidence base for addition of 7 newly recommended vaccines, and modernize vaccine distribution. Clinical tools were developed for improved conversations with parents, which helped sustain childhood immunization as a social norm. Coverage increased for vaccines to protect adolescents against pertussis, meningococcal meningitis, and human papillomavirus–associated cancers. NCIRD programs supported outbreak response for new respiratory pathogens and oversaw response of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic. Other national public health institutes might also find closer linkages between epidemiology, laboratory, and immunization programs useful.","Schuchat, Anne; Anderson, Larry J.; Rodewald, Lance E.; Cox, Nancy J.; Hajjeh, Rana; Pallansch, Mark A.; Messonnier, Nancy E.; Jernigan, Daniel B.; Wharton, Melinda",Emerg Infect Dis,572,21

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of pooling specimen for testing of SARS-CoV-2 virus, to determine whether costs and resource savings could be achieved without impacting the sensitivity of the testing. Ten specimens were pooled for testing, containing either one or two known positive specimen of varying viral concentrations. Pooling specimens did not affect the sensitivity of detecting SARS-CoV-2, and the PCR cycle threshold (Ct) between testing of pooling specimen and subsequent individual testing was not significantly different using paired t-test. This study also identified cost savings garnered from pooling of specimen for testing at 4 differing prevalence rates, ranging from 0.1-10%. Pooling specimens to test for COVID-19 infection in low prevalence areas or in low risk population can dramatically decrease the resources burden on lab operations by up to 80%.

The viral nonstructural (NS) proteins encoded by the ORF1 polyprotein induce vesical clusters harboring the viral replication sites. Little is known so far about the ultrastructure of these replication organelles or the contribution of individual NS proteins to their biogenesis. We compared the ultrastructural changes induced by expression of norovirus ORF1 polyproteins with those induced upon infection with murine norovirus (MNV). Characteristic membrane alterations induced by ORF1 expression resembled those found in MNV infected cells, consisting of vesicle accumulations likely built from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) which included single membrane vesicles (SMVs), double membrane vesicles (DMVs) and multi membrane vesicles (MMVs). In-depth analysis using electron tomography suggested that MMVs originate through the enwrapping of SMVs with tubular structures similar to mechanisms reported for picornaviruses. Expression of GII.4 NS1-2, NS3 and NS4 fused to GFP revealed distinct membrane alterations when analyzed by correlative light and electron microscopy. Expression of NS1-2 induced proliferation of smooth ER membranes forming long tubular structures that were affected by mutations in the active center of the putative NS1-2 hydrolase domain. NS3 was associated with ER membranes around lipid droplets (LDs) and induced the formation of convoluted membranes, which were even more pronounced in case of NS4. Interestingly, NS4 was the only GII.4 protein capable of inducing SMV and DMV formation when expressed individually. Our work provides the first ultrastructural analysis of norovirus GII.4 induced vesicle clusters and suggests that their morphology and biogenesis is most similar to picornaviruses. We further identified NS4 as a key factor in the formation of membrane alterations of huNoV and provide models of the putative membrane topologies of NS1-2, NS3 and NS4 to guide future studies.","Doerflinger, Sylvie Y.; Cortese, Mirko; Romero-Brey, Inés; Menne, Zach; Tubiana, Thibault; Schenk, Christian; White, Peter A.; Bartenschlager, Ralf; Bressanelli, Stéphane; Hansman, Grant S.; Lohmann, Volker",PLoS Pathog,572,16

Many studies have indicated that the current BMI cutoff value for obesity may be inaccurate in identifying individuals with excess body fat (BF) and at risk for cardiovascular diseases (CVD). This study aims to assess the performance of BMI in diagnosing obesity defined by BF percentage (BF%). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 136 participants who attended an annual health screening programme were recruited. The subjects completed the health examinations, including BMI, BF% and blood pressure measurement. A receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis was conducted to determine the optimal cutoff value of BMI in classifying obesity based on BF% (>25%). RESULTS: The ROC analysis revealed that the optimal BMI cutoff value in classifying subjects with obesity based on BF% was 24.8 kg/m(2). The agreement between the classification scheme based on the new BMI cutoff (>24.8 kg/m(2)) and BF% was higher (κ=0.722) compared to the standard BMI cutoff (>27.5 kg/m(2)) (κ=0.532). BMI 24.8 kg/m(2) also had higher sensitivity (80.0%) than 27.5 kg/m(2) (56.0%) in detecting subjects with high adiposity. The new BMI cutoff also showed a sensitivity of 63.9% in identifying subjects with hypertension compared to the standard cutoff (36.1%). CONCLUSION: The current definition of obesity based on BMI value needs to be reassessed by taking BF% into account. A new BMI cutoff point, 24.8 kg/m(2) for obesity, can identify a higher percentage of Malaysian at risk for CVD.","Aizuddin, Azimatun Noor; Chan, Chee Mun; Anwar, A Rahman; Ong, Yee Xien; Chin, Kok-Yong",Int J Gen Med,572,11

The Covid‐19 pandemic led to mitigating measures including remote working that enhanced a sedentary lifestyle. The aim of this study was to investigate whether back pain complaints have increased from pre‐Covid‐19 to during the Covid‐19 period among the adult population of Malta, while exploring the possible contributing factors. METHODS: An online survey was distributed through social media targeting the adult population of Malta. Questions on sociodemographic data, occurrence of back pain pre‐Covid‐19 and since the onset of Covid‐19 was gathered, along with changes in behavioural attitudes, daily routine and physical activity. Descriptive and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: Out of the 388 responders, 30% experienced chronic back pain pre‐Covid‐19, 49% experienced back pain since Covid‐19, with the majority of the latter claiming that they never experienced back pain before Covid‐19. Significant changes were present in daily routine and physical activity (PA) patterns. Indeed, continuously sitting down (OR: 15.53; p ≤ 0.01), no PA (OR: 4.22; p ≤ <0.01), once a week PA (OR: 5.74; p ≤ <0.01), two to three times PA a week (OR: 2.58; p = 0.05) and four to five PA a week (OR: 3.46; p = 0.02) were associated with experiencing new onset back pain since the onset of Covid‐19, when adjusted for sex, age, education and employment status. CONCLUSION: The pandemic has changed population behaviour resulting in an enhanced back pain occurrence. This is anticipated to impact the individual’s disability adjusted life years as well as increase the burden on the economy and healthcare services.

This virus is mainly transmitted through exhalations from the airways of infected persons, so that Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems might play a role in spreading the infection in indoor environments. Methods: We modelled the role of HVAC systems in the diffusion of the contagion through a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of cough at the Vatican State childrens hospital Bambino Gesu. Both waiting rooms and hospital rooms were modeled as indoor scenarios. A specific Infection-Index parameter was used to estimate the amount of contaminated air inhaled by each person present in the simulated indoor scenarios. The potential role of exhaust air ventilation systems placed above the coughing patients mouth was also assessed. Results: Our CFD-based simulations show that HVAC air-flow remarkably enhance infected droplets diffusion in the whole indoor environment within 25 seconds from the cough event, despite the observed dilution of saliva particles containing the virus. In the waiting room simulation, Infection-Index parameter increases the faster the higher the HVAC airflow. Greater flows of air conditioning correspond to greater diffusion of the infected droplets. The proper use of Local Exhaust Ventilation systems (LEV) simulated in the hospital room was associated to a complete reduction of infected droplets spreading from the patient s mouth in the first 0.5 seconds following the cough event. In the hospital room, the use of LEV system completely reduced the index computed for the patient hospitalized at the bed next to the spreader, with a decreased possibility of contagion. Conclusions: CFD-based simulations for indoor environment can be useful to optimize air conditioning flow and to predict the contagion risk both in hospitals/ambulatories and in other public/private settings.","Borro, L.; Mazzei, L.; Raponi, M.; Piscitelli, P.; Miani, A.; Secinaro, A.",,572,20

It includes a dramatic loss of gained bone mineral density (BMD) and an increased risk of vertebral fractures. This prospective multi-institutional randomized controlled trial aims to investigate whether zoledronate prevents loss of BMD after discontinuation of denosumab. The trial was registered as Denosumab Sequential Therapy (DST) trial in March 2019 at clinicaltrials.gov, with the identifier NCT03868033. Methods: The study is conducted at National Taiwan University Hospital and its branches. Patients who have continuously received denosumab treatment for two or more years are surveyed for eligibility. Baseline characteristics and questionnaires of life quality are recorded after recruitment. BMD, circulating levels of bone turnover markers (BTMs), including serum N-terminal propeptide of type 1 collagen (P1NP) and C-terminal telopeptide (CTX), are checked before the stratified randomization to 4 groups. Biological sex and the T-scores are used to create 4 strata. The participants in group 1 adhere to regular denosumab therapy for another 2 years. All the other patients receive on-time zoledronate treatment in the first year. The participants in group 2, 3, and 4 have on-time denosumab, on-time zoledronate and drug holiday in the second year, respectively. BMDs are checked annually. Pre-scheduled checkpoints of BTMs are also arranged. For patient safety, rescue treatment with another injection of zoledronate will be applied to the patients on drug holiday if the CTX levels raise above the pre-specified threshold, 0.573 ng/mL for women and 0.584 ng/mL for men. The primary outcomes are the percentage changes of BMDs in lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck. The secondary outcomes include the changes of serum level of the BTMs, new osteoporotic fractures, extra zoledronate injections needed in group 4 and the differences of quality of life. Discussion: We aim to provide evidence whether zoledronate prevents bone loss after denosumab cessation. To our knowledge, the study has the largest sample size.

The objective of this analysis was to assess associations between holiday gatherings and SARS-CoV-2 positivity in the weeks following Thanksgiving. Using an online survey, we sampled 7770 individuals across 10 US states from December 4–18, 2020, about 8–22 days post-Thanksgiving. Participants were asked about Thanksgiving, COVID-19 symptoms, and SARS-CoV-2 testing and positivity in the prior 2 weeks. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity and COVID-19 symptoms in the weeks following Thanksgiving. An activity score measured the total number of non-essential activities an individual participated in the prior 2 weeks. The probability of community transmission was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. While 47.2% had Thanksgiving at home with household members, 26.9% had guests and 25.9% traveled. There was a statistically significant interaction between how people spent Thanksgiving, the frequency of activities, and SARS-CoV-2 test positivity in the prior 2 weeks (p < 0.05). Those who had guests for Thanksgiving or traveled were only more likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 if they also had high activity (e.g., participated in > one non-essential activity/day in the prior 2 weeks). Had individuals limited the number and frequency of activities post-Thanksgiving, cases in surveyed individuals would be reduced by > 50%. As travel continues to increase and the more contagious Delta variant starts to dominate transmission, it is critical to promote how to gather in a “low-risk” manner (e.g., minimize other non-essential activities) to mitigate the need for nationwide shelter-at-home orders.","Mehta, Shruti H.; Clipman, Steven J.; Wesolowski, Amy; Solomon, Sunil S.",Sci Rep,572,10

In particular, the epidemic model, that depends on some basic characteristics, has been applied to model the evolution of the disease in Italy, India, South Korea and Iran. The economic, social and health consequences of the spread of the virus have been cataclysmic. Hence, it is imperative that mathematical models can be developed and used to compare published datasets with model predictions. The predictions estimated from the presented methodology can be used in both the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the spread. They give an insight into the spread of the virus that the published data alone cannot, by updating them and the model on a daily basis. We show that by doing so, it is possible to detect the early onset of secondary spikes in infections or the development of secondary waves. We considered data from March to August, 2020, when different communities were affected severely and demonstrate predictions depending on the model’s parameters related to the spread of COVID-19 until the end of December, 2020.

The SARS-CoV-2 genome has a capability of gaining rapid mutations as the virus spreads. Whole genome sequencing data offers a wide range of opportunities to study the mutation dynamics. The advantage of increasing amount of whole genome sequence data of SARS-CoV-2 intrigued us to explore the mutation profile across the genome, to check the genome diversity and to investigate the implications of those mutations in protein stability and viral transmission. Four proteins, surface glycoprotein, nucleocapsid, ORF1ab and ORF8 showed frequent mutations, while envelop, membrane, ORF6 and ORF7a proteins showed conservation in terms of amino acid substitutions. Some of the mutations across different proteins showed co-occurrence, suggesting their functional cooperation in stability, transmission and adaptability. Combined analysis with the frequently mutated residues identified 20 viral variants, among which 12 specific combinations comprised more than 97% of the isolates considered for the analysis. Analysis of protein structure stability of surface glycoprotein mutants indicated viability of specific variants and are more prone to be temporally and spatially distributed across the globe. Similar empirical analysis of other proteins indicated existence of important functional implications of several variants. Analysis of co-occurred mutants indicated their structural and/or functional interaction among different SARS-COV-2 proteins. Identification of frequently mutated variants among COVID-19 patients might be useful for better clinical management, contact tracing and containment of the disease.","Laha, Sayantan; Chakraborty, Joyeeta; Das, Shantanab; Manna, Soumen Kanti; Biswas, Sampa; Chatterjee, Raghunath",bioRxiv,572,13

RECENT FINDINGS: We identified 18 published technology-based studies, 6 of which were efficacy trials and the remaining 12 were either pilot randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-experimental studies. Most (n = 10) interventions were conducted outside the USA, including countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (n = 4), China (n = 3), Latin America (n = 2), and India (n = 1). All efficacy trials showed some evidence of efficacy, although uptake of HIV testing was low among in intervention trials that consisted of a low number of text messages. Most pilot RCTs demonstrated high levels of feasibility and acceptability, as well as some evidence that the intervention participants benefited more than the control group. Many non-randomized trials similarly reported positive appraisal by study participants. Recommendations for future research and practice by the authors of the studies reviewed here are summarized. SUMMARY: Technology-assisted HIV testing interventions may be an important strategy to reach national and global targets for HIV status awareness in the general population and for most at-risk groups. Although there appears to be growing evidence of their benefit, questions linger regarding how to leverage existing social media platforms to promote HIV testing, which interventions work for what populations, and best practices for scaling up mHealth and other technology-based interventions.","Horvath, Keith J.; Walker, Teresa; Mireles, Linda; Bauermeister, Jose A.; Hightow-Weidman, Lisa; Stephenson, Rob",Curr HIV/AIDS Rep,572,20

In India as well, as a precautionary measure, complete and partial lockdowns were announced in phases during March 25 to May 31, 2020. The restricted human activities led to a drastic reduction in seismic background noise in the high frequency range of 1–20 Hz, representative of cultural noise. In this study, we analyse the effect of anthropogenic activity on the Earth vibrations, utilizing ambient noise recorded at twelve broadband seismographs installed in different environmental and geological conditions in Gujarat. We find that the lockdowns caused 1–19 dB decrease in seismic noise levels. The impact of restricted anthropogenic activities is predominantly visible during the daytime in urban areas, in the vicinity of industries and/or highways. A 27–79% reduction in seismic noise ground displacement (d(rms)) is observed in daytime during the lockdown, in populated areas. However, data from station MOR reveals a drastic decrease in d(rms) amplitude both during the day (79%) and night times (87%) since factories in this area operate round the clock. The noise at stations located in remote areas and that due to microseisms, shows negligible variation.","Roy, Ketan Singha; Sharma, Jyoti; Kumar, Santosh; Kumar, M. Ravi",Sci Rep,572,1

Factors contributing to increased distress in HCWs working in high-risk areas treating patients with SARS have not been fully elucidated. The goal of this study was to quantify the psychological effects of working in a high-risk unit during the SARS outbreak. METHODS: HCWs in a Toronto hospital who worked in high-risk areas completed a questionnaire regarding their attitude toward the SARS crisis along with the Impact of Event Scale—Revised, which screens for PTSS. The comparison group consisted of clinical units that had no contact with patients infected with SARS. RESULTS: Factors that were identified to cause distress in the 248 respondent HCWs were the following: (a) perception of risk to themselves, (b) impact of the SARS crisis on their work life, (c) depressive affect, and (d) working in a high-risk unit. In addition, HCWs who cared for only one SARS patient in comparison to those caring for multiple SARS patients experienced more PTSS. CONCLUSIONS: As expected, HCWs who were working in high-risk units experienced greater distress. Contrary to expectations, HCWs who experienced greater contact with SARS patients while working in the high-risk units were less distressed. This suggests that HCW experience in treating patients infected with SARS may be a mediating factor that could be amenable to intervention in future outbreaks.","Styra, Rima; Hawryluck, Laura; Robinson, Susan; Kasapinovic, Sonja; Fones, Calvin; Gold, Wayne L.",J Psychosom Res,572,20

Given that the Association of American Medical Colleges and the American Orthopaedic Association's Council of Orthopaedic Residency Directors have recommended orthopaedic surgery residency programs for the 2021 residency application cycle cancel away rotations and in-person interviews, our objective was to evaluate the cost savings to medical students applying during this time and the potential implications. METHODS: Using the 2019 to 2020 Texas STAR Dashboard database, we queried responses from applicants applying to orthopaedic surgery residency. The dashboard was queried to record the application costs, away rotation costs, interview costs, and total costs for medical school seniors applying to orthopaedic surgery residency. Demographic information for applicants was also recorded. Mean and median costs were reported with percentile distributions and geographic comparisons. A Kruskal-Wallis H test was used to determine whether there were statistically significant differences in mean costs by medical school region. RESULTS: The 2019 to 2020 Texas STAR Dashboard database had 473 responses from applicants to orthopaedic surgery residency. The mean application costs were $1,990, away rotation costs were $3,182, interview costs were $3,129, and total costs were $8,205. The mean total costs for applicants from Midwest schools were significantly less than Western schools ($7,410/applicant vs. $9,909/applicant) (p = 0.008). There was no significant difference between the mean application fees between regions. Away rotation costs for applicants from schools in the Midwest ($2,413/applicant) were significantly less compared with Northeast ($3,279/applicant), South ($3,343/applicant), and West ($3,913/applicant) (all p < 0.002). Interview costs for applicants from schools in the Northeast ($2,891/applicant) were less than applicants from Western US schools ($3,831/applicant) (p = 0.038). CONCLUSION: In the COVID-19 era, orthopaedic residency applicants could save on average $6,311 through the use of virtual interviews and lack of away rotations. There are geographic implications, with applicants from Western US medical schools potentially saving most.","Gordon, Adam M.; Malik, Azeem Tariq; Scharschmidt, Thomas J.; Goyal, Kanu S.",JB JS Open Access,572,1

There is an emergent need to search for possible medications. Cressa cretica is reported to show antitubercular, antibacterial and expectorant property. In this research, we aim to prospect the COVID-19 main protease crystal structure (M(pro); PDB ID: 6LU7) and the active chemical constituents from Cressa cretica in order to understand the structural basis of their interactions. We examined the binding potential of active constituents of Cressa cretica plant to immensely conserved protein M(pro) of SARS-CoV-2 followed by exploration of the vast conformational space of protein–ligand complexes by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The results suggest the effectiveness of 3,5-Dicaffeoylquinic acid and Quercetin against standard drug Remdesivir. The active chemical constituents exhibited good docking scores, and interacts with binding site residues of M(pro) by forming hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions. 3,5-Dicaffeoylquinic acid showed the best affinity towards M(pro) receptor which is one of the target enzymes required by SARS CoV-2 virus for replication suggesting it to be a novel research molecule. The potential of the active chemical constituents from Cressa cretica against the SARS-CoV-2 virus has best been highlighted through this study. Therefore, these chemical entities can be further scrutinized and provides direction for further consideration for in-vivo and in-vitro validations for the treatment of covid-19.","Shah, Sapan; Chaple, Dinesh; Arora, Sumit; Yende, Subhash; Mehta, Chetan; Nayak, Usha",Journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics,572,5

Anxiety and insomnia rates have also increased among both the general public and health care professionals. Benzodiazepines are some of the most commonly used drugs in the treatment of anxiety and insomnia. However, benzodiazepines are also misused, abused alone, or abused in combination with other drugs. Lockdowns and social distancing have also had negative consequences on patients with mental health problems. We assessed the extent of benzodiazepine use during the pandemic and interpreted its effects in the future. We conducted a literature search using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol and eight articles reviewed specifically reported worrying fluctuations in benzodiazepine use during the pandemic. We observed varied trends in the usage of benzodiazepines in various parts of the world. Some studies showed an increase in the consumption of benzodiazepine while others demonstrated a decrease in the prescription refills of benzodiazepine, which may be a result of gaps in mental health care. At this time, we can conclude that the current trend with benzodiazepine use is fluctuating and mental health professionals must continue to exercise caution before prescribing benzodiazepines. Future research is also warranted to be aware of the changing patterns and to avoid misuse and/or abuse at an epidemic level.","Sarangi, Ashish; McMahon, Terry; Gude, Jayasudha",Cureus,572,1

This is particularly true for caregivers of patients with head and neck, esophageal, anal, rectal, and lung cancers, who are often receiving combined-modality treatment and may have tracheostomy tubes, gastrostomy tubes, or colostomies/ileostomies. This study aims to evaluate a simulation-based nursing intervention to provide information, support, and training to caregivers during radiation therapy. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial will include a sample of 180 patients and their family caregivers. Caregivers assigned to the control group will receive usual care and an informational booklet from the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Those in the intervention group will receive usual care, the NCI booklet, and three meetings with a nurse interventionist during radiation treatment followed by a booster call two weeks posttreatment. Intervention sessions focus on themes consistent with the trajectory of radiation therapy: the patient experience/needs, the caregiver experience and dyad communication, and transition to survivorship. Outcomes are measured at baseline, end of treatment (T2), and 4 (T3) and 20 (T4) weeks posttreatment, with the primary outcome being caregiver anxiety at T4. DISCUSSION: This trial is innovative in its use of simulation in a psychoeducational intervention for family caregivers. The intervention is administered at point-of-care and aimed at feasibility for integration into clinical practice. Patient quality of life and healthcare utilization measures will assess how providing support and training to the caregiver may impact patient outcomes.

Five cases with a clinical history of biopolymers in the gluteal region that developed iatrogenic allogenosis (IA) are presented here. The 5 cases were put under colchicine treatment for IA crisis and had non-specific symptoms (headache, cough without dyspnoea, and arthralgias) with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Their close contacts had mild to severe symptoms and three of them died. In the SARS-CoV-2 infection different inflammatory pathways are altered where colchicine reduces cytokine levels as well as the activation of macrophages, neutrophils, and the inflammasome. The possible mechanisms that colchicine may use to prevent acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in patients with COVID-19 infection are also reviewed in this article.","Montealegre-Gómez, Giovanni; Garavito, Edgar; Gómez-López, Arley; Rojas-Villarraga, Adriana; Parra-Medina, Rafael",Reumatol Clin,572,26

METHOD: In this national level cross-sectional survey, a questionnaire was administered to 173 technicians engaged in EEG at four clinics specializing in epilepsy care and 20 hospitals accredited as (quasi-) epilepsy centers or epilepsy training facilities in Japan from March 1 to April 30, 2021. We collected data on participants’ profiles, information about work, and psychological distress outcome measurements, such as the K-6 and Tokyo Metropolitan Distress Scale for Pandemic (TMDP). Linear regression analysis was used to identify the risk factors for psychological distress. Factors that were significantly associated with psychological distress in the univariate analysis were subjected to multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Among the 142 respondents (response rate: 82%), 128 were included in the final analysis. As many as 35.2% of EEG technicians have been under psychological distress. In multivariate linear regression analysis for K-6, female sex, examination for patients (suspected) with COVID-19, and change in salary or bonus were independent associated factors for psychological distress. Contrastingly, in multivariate linear regression analysis for TMDP, female sex, presence of cohabitants who had to be separated from the respondent due to this pandemic, and change in salary or bonus were independent associated factors for psychological distress. CONCLUSION: We successfully identified the risk factors associated with psychological distress in EEG technicians during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The position paper is based on the current knowledge that is evolving daily. Many of the published and cited studies require further review, also because many of them did not undergo standard review processes.Therefore, this position paper is also subject to a continuous review process and will be further developed in cooperation with the other professional societies. This position paper is structured into the following five topics: 1. Pathophysiology of acute respiratory insufficiency in patients without immunity infected with SARS-CoV-2 2. Temporal course and prognosis of acute respiratory insufficiency during the course of the disease 3. Oxygen insufflation, high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and invasive ventilation with special consideration of infectious aerosol formation 4. Non-invasive ventilation in ARI 5. Supply continuum for the treatment of ARI Key points have been highlighted as core statements and significant observations. Regarding the pathophysiological aspects of acute respiratory insufficiency (ARI), the pulmonary infection with SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 runs through three phases: early infection, pulmonary manifestation and severe hyperinflammatory phase. There are differences between advanced COVID-19-induced lung damage and those changes seen in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndromes (ARDS) as defined by the Berlin criteria. In a pathophysiologically plausible - but currently not yet histopathologically substantiated – model, two types (L-type and H-type) are distinguished, which correspond to an early and late phase. This distinction can be taken into consideration in the differential instrumentation in the therapy of ARI. The assessment of the extent of ARI should be carried out by an arterial or capillary blood gas analysis under room air conditions and must include the calculation of the oxygen supply (measured from the variables of oxygen saturation, the Hb value, the corrected values of the Hüfner number and the cardiac output). In principle, aerosols can cause transmission of infectious viral particles. Open systems or leakage systems (so-called vented masks) can prevent the release of respirable particles. Procedures in which the invasive ventilation system must be opened, and endotracheal intubation must be carried out are associated with an increased risk of infection. The protection of personnel with personal protective equipment should have very high priority because fear of contagion must not be a primary reason for intubation. If the specifications for protective equipment (eye protection, FFP2 or FFP-3 mask, gown) are adhered to, inhalation therapy, nasal high-flow (NHF) therapy, CPAP therapy or NIV can be carried out according to the current state of knowledge without increased risk of infection to the staff. A significant proportion of patients with respiratory failure presents with relevant hypoxemia, often also caused by a high inspiratory oxygen fraction (FiO2) including NHF, and this hypoxemia cannot be not completely corrected. In this situation, CPAP/NIV therapy can be administered under use of a mouth and nose mask or a respiratory helmet as therapy escalation, as long as the criteria for endotracheal intubation are not fulfilled. In acute hypoxemic respiratory insufficiency, NIV should be performed in an intensive care unit or in a comparable unit by personnel with appropriate expertise. Under CPAP/NIV, a patient can deteriorate rapidly. For this reason, continuous monitoring with readiness to carry out intubation must be ensured at all times. If CPAP/NIV leads to further progression of ARI, intubation and subsequent invasive ventilation should be carried out without delay if no DNI order is in place. In the case of patients in whom invasive ventilation, after exhausting all guideline-based measures, is not sufficient, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation procedure (ECMO) should be considered to ensure sufficient oxygen supply and to remove CO (2) .","Pfeifer, M.; Ewig, S.; Voshaar, T.; Randerath, W.; Bauer, T.; Geiseler, J.; Dellweg, D.; Westhoff, M.; Windisch, W.; Schönhofer, B.; Kluge, S.; Lepper, P.

Here, we isolate and humanize an angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2)-blocking monoclonal antibody (MAb), named h11B11, which exhibits potent inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV and circulating global SARS-CoV-2 lineages. When administered therapeutically or prophylactically in the hACE2 mouse model, h11B11 alleviates and prevents SARS-CoV-2 replication and virus-induced pathological syndromes. No significant changes in blood pressure and hematology chemistry toxicology were observed after injections of multiple high dosages of h11B11 in cynomolgus monkeys. Analysis of the structures of the h11B11/ACE2 and receptor-binding domain (RBD)/ACE2 complexes shows hindrance and epitope competition of the MAb and RBD for the receptor. Together, these results suggest h11B11 as a potential therapeutic countermeasure against SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and escape variants.","Du, Yanyun; Shi, Rui; Zhang, Ying; Duan, Xiaomin; Li, Li; Zhang, Jing; Wang, Fengze; Zhang, Ruixue; Shen, Hao; Wang, Yue; Wu, Zheng; Peng, Qianwen; Pan, Ting; Sun, Wanwei; Huang, Weijin; Feng, Yue; Feng, Hui; Xiao, Junyu; Tan, Wenjie; Wang, Youchun; Wang, Chenhui; Yan, Jinghua",Nat Commun,572,0

Korea has experienced an extensive outbreak, which was linked to a religion-related super-spreading event. However, the implementation of various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), including social distancing, spring semester postponing, and extensive testing and contact tracing controlled the epidemic. Herein, we estimated the effectiveness of each NPI using a simulation model. METHODS: A compartment model with a susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantined-hospitalized structure was employed. Using the Monte-Carlo-Markov-Chain algorithm with Gibbs' sampling method, we estimated the time-varying effective contact rate to calibrate the model with the reported daily new confirmed cases from February 12th to March 31st (7 weeks). Moreover, we conducted scenario analyses by adjusting the parameters to estimate the effectiveness of NPI. RESULTS: Relaxed social distancing among adults would have increased the number of cases 27.4-fold until the end of March. Spring semester non-postponement would have increased the number of cases 1.7-fold among individuals aged 0–19, while lower quarantine and detection rates would have increased the number of cases 1.4-fold. CONCLUSION: Among the three NPI measures, social distancing in adults showed the highest effectiveness. The substantial effect of social distancing should be considered when preparing for the 2nd wave of COVID-19.","Min, Kyung-Duk; Kang, Heewon; Lee, Ju-Yeun; Jeon, Seonghee; Cho, Sung-il",J Korean Med Sci,572,10

While several countries have chosen the almost complete lock-down for slowing down SARS-CoV-2 spread, scientific community is called to respond to the devastating outbreak by identifying new tools for diagnosis and treatment of the dangerous COVID-19. With this aim we performed an in silico comparative modeling analysis, which allows to gain new insights about the main conformational changes occurring in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, at the level of the receptor binding domain (RBD), along interactions with human cells angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, that favour human cell invasion. Furthermore, our analysis provides i) an ideal pipeline to identify already characterized antibodies that might target SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD, for preventing interactions with the human ACE2, and ii) instructions for building new possible neutralizing antibodies, according to chemical/physical space restraints and complementary determining regions (CDR) mutagenesis of the identified existing antibodies. The proposed antibodies show in silico a high affinity for SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD and can be used as reference antibodies also for building new high affinity antibodies against present and future coronavirus able to invade human cells through interactions of their spike proteins with the human ACE2. More in general, our analysis provides indications for the set-up of the right biological molecular context for investigating spike RBD-ACE2 interactions for the development of new vaccines, diagnosis kits and other treatments based on the usage or the targeting of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.","Mercurio, Ivan; Tragni, Vincenzo; Busco, Francesco; De Grassi, Anna; Pierri, Ciro Leonardo",bioRxiv,572,1

About seventy-nine million infections and more than 1.7 million death have been reported to date, along with destruction of the global economy. With the uncertainty evolved by alarming level of genome mutations, coupled with likelihood of generating only a short lived immune response by the vaccine injections, the identification of antiviral drugs for direct therapy is the need of the hour. Strategies to inhibit virus infection and replication focus on targets such as the spike protein and non-structural proteins including the highly conserved RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase, nucleotidyl-transferases, main protease and papain-like proteases. There is also an indirect option to target the host cell recognition systems such as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), transmembrane protease, serine 2, host cell expressed CD147, and the host furin. A drug search strategy consensus in tandem with analysis of currently available information is extremely important for the rapid identification of anti-viral. An unprecedented display of cooperation among the scientific community regarding SARS-CoV-2 research has resulted in the accumulation of an enormous amount of literature that requires curation. Drug repurposing and drug combinations have drawn tremendous attention for rapid therapeutic application, while high throughput screening and virtual searches support de novo drug identification. Here, we examine how certain approved drugs targeting different viruses can play a role in combating this new virus and analyze how they demonstrate efficacy under clinical assessment.

The T strain of the virus caused only mild respiratory signs in both Rhode Island Red (RIR) and White Leghorn (WL) breeds; the 50 per cent mortality induced was due to acute nephritis. All the infected birds developed high titres of antibody to IBV for up to 30 weeks. In spite of the persistence of antibody, about 35 per cent of the RIR developed chronic progressive nephritis. The histology showed varying degrees of pathological changes in the tubules, with relatively unaffected glomeruli. Foci of mononuclear cell infiltration were prominent in the cortex and medulla, particularly in chronic nephritis. Cytoplasmic IBV immunofluorescence was found in all segments of the tubules, but not in the glomeruli. There was no evidence of virus replication in the caecal tonsil and bursa of Fabricius. Evidence of extensive coronavirus replication was found in the cells of the tubules. A large number of viral inclusion bodies as seen containing dark smooth particles 120 nm in diameter within a single membrane. Virus was readily recovered from the kidneys as well as faeces of birds with acute and chronic nephritis. It is concluded that direct virus-induced cell lysis is the primary cause of IBV nephritis.

However, data on mutations during the course of infection are scarce. This study aims to determine viral genome diversity in serial samples of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Targeted deep sequencing of spike gene was performed on serial respiratory specimens from COVID-19 patients using nanopore and Illumina sequencing. Sanger sequencing was then performed to confirm the single nucleotide polymorphisms. RESULTS: A total of 28 serial respiratory specimens from 12 patients were successfully sequenced using nanopore and Illumina sequencing. A 75-year-old patient with severe disease had a mutation, G22017T, identified in the second specimen. The frequency of G22017T increased from ≤5% (nanopore: 3.8%; Illumina: 5%) from first respiratory tract specimen (sputum) to ≥60% (nanopore: 67.7%; Illumina: 60.4%) in the second specimen (saliva; collected 2 days after the 1(st) specimen). The difference in G22017T frequency was also confirmed by Sanger sequencing. G22017T corresponds to W152L amino acid mutation in the spike protein which was only found in <0.03% of the sequences deposited into a public database. Spike amino acid residue 152 is located within the N-terminal domain, which mediates the binding of a neutralizing antibody. CONCLUSIONS: A spike protein amino acid mutation W152L located within a neutralizing epitope has appeared naturally in a patient. Our study demonstrated that monitoring of serial specimens is important in identifying hotspots of mutations, especially those occurring at neutralizing epitopes which may affect the therapeutic efficacy of monoclonal antibodies.","Ip, Jonathan Daniel; Kok, Kin-Hang; Chan, Wan-Mui; Wing-Ho Chu, Allen; Wu, Wai-Lan; Chik-Yan Yip, Cyril; To, Wing-Kin; Tak-Yin Tsang, Owen; Leung, Wai-Shing; Shiu-Hong Chik, Thomas; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Fan-Ngai Hung, Ivan; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Kai-Wang To, Kelvin",Clin Microbiol Infect,572,1

METHODS Participants were enrolled in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study. A total of 7,842 youth (mean age = 12.4 years, range = 10.5-14.6) at 21 study sites across the U.S. completed a three-wave assessment of substance use between May and August 2020. Youth reported whether they had used alcohol, nicotine, cannabis, or other substances in the past 30 days. Data were linked to prepandemic surveys that the same youth had completed in the years 2018-2020, before the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS Past-30-day substance use remained stable in the 6 months since stay-at-home orders were first issued in U.S. states/counties; was primarily episodic (1-2 days in the past month); and was typically limited to a single substance. Using pretest/posttest and age-period designs, we found that compared to before the pandemic, fewer youth were using alcohol and more youth were using nicotine or misusing prescription drugs. During the pandemic, youth were more likely to use substances when they were more stressed by pandemic-related uncertainty; their family experienced material hardship; their parents used alcohol or drugs; or they experienced greater depression or anxiety. Neither engagement in social distancing nor worry about COVID-19 infection was associated with substance use. Several risk factors were stronger among older (vs. younger) adolescents. CONCLUSIONS Among youth in early adolescence, advent of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with decreased use of alcohol and increased use of nicotine and misuse of prescription drugs.","Pelham, William E; Tapert, Susan F; Gonzalez, Marybel Robledo; McCabe, Connor J; Lisdahl, Krista M; Alzueta, Elisabet; Baker, Fiona C; Breslin, Florence J; Dick, Anthony Steven; Dowling, Gayathri J; Guillaume, Mathieu; Hoffman, Elizabeth A; Marshall, Andrew T; McCandliss, Bruce D; Sheth, Chandni S; Sowell, Elizabeth R; Thompson, Wesley K; Van Rinsveld, Amandine M; Wade, Natasha E; Brown, Sandra A",The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,572,16

Self-management plays a key role in improving modifiable risk factors. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of wearable devices, a health management platform, and social media at improving the self-management of CKD, with the goal of establishing a new self-management intervention model. METHODS: In a 90-day prospective experimental study, a total of 60 people with CKD at stages 1-4 were enrolled in the intervention group (n=30) and control group (n=30). All participants were provided with wearable devices that collected exercise-related data. All participants maintained dietary diaries using a smartphone app. All dietary and exercise information was then uploaded to a health management platform. Suggestions about diet and exercise were provided to the intervention group only, and a social media group was created to inspire the participants in the intervention group. Participants’ self-efficacy and self-management questionnaire scores, Kidney Disease Quality of Life scores, body composition, and laboratory examinations before and after the intervention were compared between the intervention and control groups. RESULTS: A total of 49 participants completed the study (25 in the intervention group and 24 in the control group); 74% of the participants were men and the mean age was 51.22 years. There were no differences in measured baseline characteristics between the groups except for educational background. After the intervention, the intervention group showed significantly higher scores for self-efficacy (mean 171.28, SD 22.92 vs mean 142.21, SD 26.36; P<.001) and self-management (mean 54.16, SD 6.71 vs mean 47.58, SD 6.42; P=.001). Kidney Disease Quality of Life scores were also higher in the intervention group (mean 293.16, SD 34.21 vs mean 276.37, SD 32.21; P=.02). The number of steps per day increased in the intervention group (9768.56 in week 1 and 11,389.12 in week 12). The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of the intervention group was higher than that of the control group (mean 72.47, SD 24.28 vs mean 59.69, SD 22.25 mL/min/1.73m(2); P=.03) and the decline in eGFR was significantly slower in the intervention group (–0.56 vs –4.58 mL/min/1.73m(2)). There were no differences in body composition between groups postintervention. CONCLUSIONS: The use of wearable devices, a health management platform, and social media support not only strengthened self-efficacy and self-management but also improved quality of life and a slower eGFR decline in people with CKD at stages 1-4. These results outline a new self-management model to promote healthy lifestyle behaviors for patients with CKD.

Mancur Olson suggests that a rational individual will not participate in collective action which provides no positive net benefit for him or her. Based on this premise, it would seem that rationality drives homeowners to free-ride on others’ efforts and that, as a result, no collective action will take place. However, some homeowners do actively participate in housing management, and it is worthwhile to examine why some participate and others do not. Building on the wide-ranging applications of the collective interest model (CIM) in explaining political participation and environmental activism, this paper expands its relevance to the arena of housing management. The explanatory analysis which is based on the findings of a structured questionnaire survey in Hong Kong corroborates the central propositions of the CIM and provides a theoretical account of housing management activism. In brief, housing management activism is a function of beliefs about personal and group efficacy, the value of the collective good, and the selective benefits and costs of participation. These findings have far-reaching implications for the formulation of government policies promoting homeowners’ active involvement in housing management in Hong Kong and other megacities.","Yau, Yung",Habitat Int,572,26

Here we show that TNF receptor superfamily member 13B (TNFRSF13B) variants, which enhance defense against certain pathogens, also control immune-mediated injury of transplants, by regulating innate B cells’ functions. Analysis of TNFRSF13B in human kidney transplant recipients revealed that 33% of those with antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) but fewer than 6% of those with stable graft function had TNFRSF13B missense mutations. To explore mechanisms underlying aggressive immune responses, we investigated alloimmunity and rejection in mice. Cardiac allografts in Tnfrsf13b-mutant mice underwent early and severe AMR. The dominance and precocity of AMR in Tnfrsf13b-deficient mice were not caused by increased alloantibodies. Rather, Tnfrsf13b mutations decreased “natural” IgM and compromised complement regulation, leading to complement deposition in allografted hearts and autogenous kidneys. Thus, WT TNFRSF13B and Tnfrsf13b support innate B cell functions that limit complement-associated inflammation; in contrast, common variants of these genes intensify inflammatory responses that help clear microbial infections but allow inadvertent tissue injury to ensue. The wide variation in inflammatory reactions associated with TNFRSF13B diversity suggests polymorphisms could underlie variation in host defense and explosive inflammatory responses that sometimes enhance morbidity associated with immune responses.","de Mattos Barbosa, Mayara Garcia; Lefferts, Adam R.; Huynh, Daniel; Liu, Hui; Zhang, Yu; Fu, Beverly; Barnes, Jenna; Samaniego, Milagros; Bram, Richard J.; Geha, Raif S.; Shikanov, Ariella; Prak, Eline T.

The challenge posed by the COVID-19 pandemic may potentially represent an overwhelmingly stressful event for patients with chronic diseases. Aim of our study was to investigate the levels of resilience in individuals with inflammatory arthritis living in Emilia Romagna, the third hardest-hit Italian region during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. To this purpose, we developed a survey consisting of four different sections assessing demographic characteristics, the 14-item resilience scale (RS14) and questionnaires evaluating depression and anxiety. Consecutive patients with inflammatory arthritis were recruited over a short time frame immediately after the end of national lockdown and compared with control individuals from the general population. One hundred twenty-two patients and 173 controls were included. Levels of resilience, as measured by RS14 score, were significantly higher in patients with inflammatory arthritis (82.6 ± 14.0 vs 79.0 ± 12.8, p = 0.018). After stratification for gender, the difference in RS14 score was maintained in women (p = 0.045), but not in men (p = 0.252).

Methods: Using data from the Health Management Information System (January 2018 - December 2020), we evaluated the impact of the pandemic on the use of essential health services (total visits, maternal health, vaccinations, visits for common infectious diseases, and diagnosis of non-communicable diseases) using interrupted time series with mixed effects segmented Poisson regression models during the first wave of the pandemic. Analyses were stratified by age, sex, health facility, and neighbourhood. Results: Health service use dropped rapidly following the start of the pandemic and ranged from 16% for hypertension diagnoses to 39% for diabetes diagnoses. However, reductions were highly concentrated in Gombe (81% decline in total visits) relative to health zones without lockdown. When the lockdown was lifted, total visits, visits for infectious diseases, and diagnoses for non-communicable diseases increased approximately two-fold. Hospitals were more affected than health centres. Overall, the use of maternal health services and vaccinations was not significantly affected.

Decisions about causality require systematic assessment to guide public health actions. The objectives of this study were: to update and re-assess the evidence for causality through a rapid and systematic review about links between Zika virus infection and a) congenital brain abnormalities, including microcephaly, in the foetuses and offspring of pregnant women and b) Guillain-Barré syndrome in any population; and to describe the process and outcomes of an expert assessment of the evidence about causality. The study had three linked components. First, in February 2016, we developed a causality framework that defined questions about the relationship between Zika virus infection and each of the two clinical outcomes in 10 dimensions; temporality, biological plausibility, strength of association, alternative explanations, cessation, dose-response, animal experiments, analogy, specificity and consistency. Second, we did a systematic review (protocol number CRD42016036693). We searched multiple online sources up to May 30, 2016 to find studies that directly addressed either outcome and any causality dimension, used methods to expedite study selection, data extraction and quality assessment, and summarised evidence descriptively. Third, a multidisciplinary panel of experts assessed the review findings and reached consensus on causality. We found 1091 unique items up to May 30, 2016. For congenital brain abnormalities, including microcephaly, we included 72 items; for eight of 10 causality dimensions (all except dose-response relationship and specificity) we found that more than half the relevant studies supported a causal association with Zika virus infection. For Guillain-Barré syndrome, we included 36 items, of which more than half the relevant studies supported a causal association in seven of ten dimensions (all except dose-response relationship, specificity and animal experimental evidence). Articles identified non-systematically from May 30-July 29, 2016 strengthened the review findings. The expert panel concluded that: a) the most likely explanation of available evidence from outbreaks of Zika virus infection and clusters of microcephaly is that Zika virus infection during pregnancy is a cause of congenital brain abnormalities including 61 microcephaly; and b) the most likely explanation of available evidence from outbreaks of Zika virus infection and Guillain-Barré syndrome is that Zika virus infection is a trigger of Guillain-Barré syndrome. The expert panel recognised that Zika virus alone may not be sufficient to cause either congenital brain abnormalities or Guillain-Barré syndrome but agreed that the evidence was sufficient to recommend increased public health measures. Weaknesses are the limited assessment of the role of dengue virus and other possible co-factors, the small number of comparative epidemiological studies, and the difficulty in keeping the review up to date with the pace of publication of new research. Rapid and systematic reviews with frequent updating and open dissemination are now needed, both for appraisal of the evidence about Zika virus infection and for the next public health threats that will emerge. This rapid systematic review found sufficient evidence to say that Zika virus is a cause of congenital abnormalities and is a trigger of Guillain-Barré situation.","Krauer, Fabienne; Riesen, Maurane; Reveiz, Ludovic; Oladapo, Olufemi T; Martínez-Vega, Ruth; Porgo, Teegwendé V.; Haefliger, Anina; Broutet, Nathalie J; Low, Nicola",bioRxiv,572,23

The public health crisis in the new era presents new characteristics: systematic, cross-border and uncertainty. The governance dilemma of a public health crisis generally emphasizes the joint participation and communication of different subjects, which is suspected of overlapping and redundancy, and lacks the auxiliary support of major public health crisis events. It dispels the significance of government-level cooperation. The essence of the public health crisis governance system is the chain law of stimulus–response. In combination with COVID-19 development in China, we track down the main reasons for the temporary disruption and the government’s response to this major public health crisis. We mainly examine the tension between the centralization of power in China’s governance structure and the effectiveness of local governance, and the control of local governments in information disclosure. The response to a public health crisis and the optimization of a decision-making mechanism should build tension between the centralization of power and effectiveness of local governance. It is suggested that government should disclose and share information to the public timely and pay more attention to the core value of order in crisis management.","Zhang, Jinrui; Zhang, Ruilian",Healthcare (Basel),572,18

METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional, single-center study conducted in 127 mild cases of COVID-19 positive patients admitted between 27(th) March and 19(th) April 2020 in a tertiary care COVID-19 hospital in north India. From the hospital records, demographic data is collected. Ocular history and ocular examinations were done by face-to-face survey during ward rounds. RESULTS: A total of 127 patients were included in the study with a median age of 38.8 years. Forty-eight (37.80%) patients had upper respiratory tract symptoms, 20 (15.75%) patients had systemic illness, 18 (14.17%) patients were using spectacles, and 50 (39.37%) patients had history of hand-eye contact. Out of 12 (9.45%) patients who had ocular complaints, 11 (8.66%) had ocular manifestation after admission. Among 11 patients, eight (6.29%) had conjunctival congestion. Three (3/8) patients had developed conjunctival congestion even before the manifestation of definite COVID-19 symptoms. Five patients (5/8) patients had no other associated ocular symptoms other than congestion. Six patients (6/8) had symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection. CONCLUSION: Mild conjunctivitis manifesting as conjunctival congestion is common and is one of the major ocular manifestations in COVID-19 positive patients even with milder disease.","Sindhuja, K; Lomi, Neiwete; Asif, Mohamed I; Tandon, Radhika",Indian J Ophthalmol,572,16

The management of MDD in the palliative care setting can be challenging as typical antidepressants may not work in time nor be tolerated due to coexisting organ dysfunctions, symptom burden and frailty. Parenteral ketamine was found to exhibit effective and rapid-onset antidepressant effect even against treatment-resistant depression in the psychiatric population. However, there is currently neither feasibility study nor available prospective study available to inform of the safety, tolerability and efficacy of such for MDD in the palliative setting. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is an open-labelled, single arm, phase II pilot feasibility study involving adult patients with advanced life-limiting illnesses and MDD across four palliative care services in Australia. It has an individual dose-titration design (0.1–0.4 mg/kg) with weekly treatments of subcutaneous ketamine infusion over 2 hours. The primary outcome is feasibility. The secondary outcomes are related to the safety, tolerability and antidepressant efficacy of ketamine, participants’ satisfaction in relation to the trial process and the reasons for not completing the study at various stages. The feasibility data will be reported using descriptive statistics. Meanwhile, side effects, tolerability and efficacy data will be analysed using change of assessment scores from baseline. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval was acquired (South Western Sydney Local Health District: HREC/18/LPOOL/466). The results of this study will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals and presented at relevant conferences.

Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs may reduce the immunogenicity of common vaccines. We will review here available data regarding the effect of these medications on influenza, pneumococcal, herpes zoster, SARS-CoV-2, hepatitis B, human papilloma virus and yellow fever vaccines. Rituximab has the most substantial impact on vaccine immunogenicity, which is most profound when vaccinations are given at shorter intervals after rituximab dosing. Methotrexate has less substantial effect but appears to adversely impact most vaccine immunogenicity. Abatacept likely decrease vaccine immunogenicity, although these studies are limited by the lack of adequate control groups. Janus kinase and tumour necrosis factor inhibitors decrease absolute antibody titres for many vaccines, but do not seem to significantly impact the proportions of patients achieving seroprotection. Other biologics (interleukin-6R (IL-6R), IL-12/IL-23 and IL-17 inhibitors) have little observed impact on vaccine immunogenicity. Data regarding the effect of these medications on the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine immunogenicity are just now emerging, and early glimpses appear similar to our experience with other vaccines. In this review, we summarise the most recent data regarding vaccine response and efficacy in this setting, particularly in light of current vaccination recommendations for immunocompromised patients.","Friedman, Marcia A; Curtis, Jeffrey R; Winthrop, Kevin L",Ann Rheum Dis,572,32

The disease is caused by contact with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which probably jumped from an animal host to humans. SARS-CoV-2 infects various tissues in the body, notably the lungs, and patients usually die from respiratory complications. Mathematical models of the disease have been instrumental to guide the implementation of mitigation strategies aimed at slowing the spread of the disease. One of the key parameters of mathematical models is the basic reproduction ratio R0, which measures the degree of infectivity of affected individuals. The goal of mitigation is to reduce R0 as close or below 1 as possible, as it means that new infections are in decline. In the present work, we use the recursive least-squares algorithm to establish the stochastic variability of a time-varying R0(t) from eight different countries: Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, Spain, and the United States of America. The proposed system can be implemented as an online tracking application providing information about the dynamics of the pandemic to health officials and the public at large.","Silveira, A. d.

In December 2019, a novel illness termed COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, was reported in China. This disease soon spread around the world and was declared a pandemic by the WHO on March 11, 2020. Considering that the malaria burden is high in many low-income tropical countries with little capacity to fund malaria control and eradication programs, the fight against malaria in these regions is likely to be hindered by COVID-19. Indeed, access to health care has generally been limited during the pandemic, whereas malaria interventions, such as seasonal malaria chemoprevention, and distribution of long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets, have been suspended because of lockdowns. Likewise, the repurposing of antimalarials for the treatment of COVID-19 and a shift in focus from the production of malaria rapid diagnostic tests to COVID-19 rapid diagnostic tests are causes for concern in malaria-endemic regions. COVID-19 has disproportionately affected developed countries, threatening their capacity to aid in malaria control efforts. Here, we address impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the management and control of malaria in Africa.","Aborode, Abdullahi Tunde; David, Kenneth Bitrus; Uwishema, Olivier; Nathaniel, Agbendeh Lubem; Imisioluwa, Jegede Oluwatoyin; Onigbinde, Sherifdeen Bamidele; Farooq, Fozia",Am J Trop Med Hyg,572,26

The challenge is to devise growth, transfer and fabrication protocols providing high (≥5000 cm(2) V(–1) s(–1)) mobility devices with reliable performance at the wafer scale. Here, we present a flow for the integration of graphene in photonics circuits. This relies on chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of single layer graphene (SLG) matrices comprising up to ∼12000 individual single crystals, grown to match the geometrical configuration of the devices in the photonic circuit. This is followed by a transfer approach which guarantees coverage over ∼80% of the device area, and integrity for up to 150 mm wafers, with room temperature mobility ∼5000 cm(2) V(–1) s(–1). We use this process flow to demonstrate double SLG electro-absorption modulators with modulation efficiency ∼0.25, 0.45, 0.75, 1 dB V(–1) for device lengths ∼30, 60, 90, 120 μm. The data rate is up to 20 Gbps. Encapsulation with single-layer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is used to protect SLG during plasma-enhanced CVD of Si(3)N(4), ensuring reproducible device performance. The processes are compatible with full automation.

Laboratory findings from a significant number of patients with COVID-19 indicate the occurrence of leukocytopenia, specifically lymphocytopenia. Moreover, infected patients can experience contrasting outcomes depending on lymphocytopenia status. Patients with resolved lymphocytopenia are more likely to recover, whereas critically ill patients with signs of unresolved lymphocytopenia develop severe complications, sometimes culminating in death. Why immunodepression manifests in patients with COVID-19 remains unclear. Therefore, the evaluation of clinical symptoms and laboratory findings from infected patients is critical for understanding the disease course and its consequences. In this review, we take a logical approach to unravel the reasons for immunodepression in patients with COVID-19. Following the footprints of the virus within host tissues, from entry to exit, we extrapolate the mechanisms underlying the phenomenon of immunodepression.","Alshammary, Amal F.; Al-Sulaiman, Abdulrahman M.",Virulence,572,16
