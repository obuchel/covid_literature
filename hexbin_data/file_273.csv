1220,Estimating the reproductive number in the presence of spatial heterogeneity of transmission patterns,2013-07-26,"BACKGROUND: Estimates of parameters for disease transmission in large-scale infectious disease outbreaks are often obtained to represent large groups of people, providing an average over a potentially very diverse area. For control measures to be more effective, a measure of the heterogeneity of the parameters is desirable. METHODS: We propose a novel extension of a network-based approach to estimating the reproductive number. With this we can incorporate spatial and/or demographic information through a similarity matrix. We apply this to the 2009 Influenza pandemic in South Africa to understand the spatial variability across provinces. We explore the use of five similarity matrices to illustrate their impact on the subsequent epidemic parameter estimates. RESULTS: When treating South Africa as a single entity with homogeneous transmission characteristics across the country, the basic reproductive number, R(0), (and imputation range) is 1.33 (1.31, 1.36). When fitting a new model for each province with no inter-province connections this estimate varies little (1.23-1.37). Using the proposed method with any of the four similarity measures yields an overall R(0) that varies little across the four new models (1.33 to 1.34). However, when allowed to vary across provinces, the estimated R(0) is greater than one consistently in only two of the nine provinces, the most densely populated provinces of Gauteng and Western Cape. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the spatial heterogeneity of influenza transmission was compelling in South Africa during the 2009 pandemic. This variability makes a qualitative difference in our understanding of the epidemic. While the cause of this fluctuation might be partially due to reporting differences, there is substantial evidence to warrant further investigation.","White, Laura F; Archer, Brett; Pagano, Marcello",Int J Health Geogr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3735474/,273
4170,The socio-economic distribution of exposure to Ebola: Survey evidence from Liberia and Sierra Leone,2019-11-15,"Socio-economic factors are widely believed to have been an important driver of the transmission of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) during the West African outbreak of 2014–16, however, studies that have investigated the relationship between socio-economic status (SES) and EVD have found inconsistent results. Using nationally representative household survey data on whether respondents knew a close friend or family member with Ebola, we explore the SES determinants of EVD exposure along individual, household, and community lines in Liberia and Sierra Leone. While we find no overall association between household wealth and EVD exposure, we find that pooled data mask important differences observed within countries with higher wealth households more likely to have been exposed to EVD in Sierra Leone and the opposite relationship in Liberia. Finally, we also generally find a positive association between education and EVD exposure both at the individual and the community levels in the full sample. There is an urgent need to better understand these relationships to examine both why the outbreak spread and to help prepare for future outbreaks.","Grépin, Karen A.; Poirier, Mathieu J.P.; Fox, Ashley M.",SSM Popul Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6880008/,273
4761,Diagnosis of severe respiratory infections in immunocompromised patients,2020-02-07,"An interdisciplinary working group from the German Society of Hospital Hygiene (DGKH) and the German Society for Anesthesiology and Intensive Care (DGAI) worked out the following recommendations for infection prevention during anesthesia by using breathing system filters (BSF). The BSF shall be changed after each patient. The filter retention efficiency for airborne particles is recommended to be >99% (II). The retention performance of BSF for liquids is recommended to be at pressures of at least 60 hPa (=60 mbar) or 20 hPa above the selected maximum ventilation pressure in the anesthetic system. The anesthesia breathing system may be used for a period of up to 7 days provided that the functional requirements of the system remain unchanged and the manufacturer states this in the instructions for use. The breathing system and the manual ventilation bag are changed immediately after the respective anesthesia if the following situation has occurred or it is suspected to have occurred: Notifiable infectious disease involving the risk of transmission via the breathing system and the manual bag, e.g. tuberculosis, acute viral hepatitis, measles, influenza virus, infection and/or colonization with a multi-resistant pathogen or upper or lower respiratory tract infections. In case of visible contamination e.g. by blood or in case of defect, it is required that the BSF and also the anesthesia breathing system is changed and the breathing gas conducting parts of the anesthesia ventilator are hygienically reprocessed. Observing of the appropriate hand disinfection is very important. All surfaces of the anesthesia equipment exposed to hand contact must be disinfected after each case.","Kranabetter, R.",Anaesthesist,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7080057/,273

14455,Continuous external negative pressure improves oxygenation and respiratory mechanics in Experimental Lung Injury in Pigs – A pilot proof-of-concept trial,2020-12-18,"BACKGROUND: Flow-controlled ventilation (FCV) allows expiratory flow control, reducing the collapse of the airways during expiration. The performance of FCV during one-lung ventilation (OLV) under intravascular normo- and hypovolaemia is currently unknown. In this explorative study, we hypothesised that OLV with FCV improves PaO(2) and reduces mechanical power compared to volume-controlled ventilation (VCV). Sixteen juvenile pigs were randomly assigned to one of two groups: (1) intravascular normovolaemia (n = 8) and (2) intravascular hypovolaemia (n = 8). To mimic inflammation due to major thoracic surgery, a thoracotomy was performed, and 0.5 μg/kg/h lipopolysaccharides from Escherichia coli continuously administered intravenously. Animals were randomly assigned to OLV with one of two sequences (60 min per mode): (1) VCV–FCV or (2) FCV–VCV. Variables of gas exchange, haemodynamics and respiratory signals were collected 20, 40 and 60 min after initiation of OLV with each mechanical ventilation mode. The distribution of ventilation was determined using electrical impedance tomography (EIT). RESULTS: Oxygenation did not differ significantly between modes (P = 0.881). In the normovolaemia group, the corrected expired minute volume (P = 0.022) and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) were lower during FCV than VCV. The minute volume (P ≤ 0.001), respiratory rate (P ≤ 0.001), total PEEP (P ≤ 0.001), resistance of the respiratory system (P ≤ 0.001), mechanical power (P ≤ 0.001) and resistive mechanical power (P ≤ 0.001) were lower during FCV than VCV irrespective of the volaemia status. The distribution of ventilation did not differ between both ventilation modes (P = 0.103). CONCLUSIONS: In a model of OLV in normo- and hypovolemic pigs, mechanical power was lower during FCV compared to VCV, without significant differences in oxygenation. Furthermore, the efficacy of ventilation was higher during FCV compared to VCV during normovolaemia.","Wittenstein, Jakob; Scharffenberg, Martin; Ran, Xi; Keller, Diana; Michler, Pia; Tauer, Sebastian; Theilen, Raphael; Kiss, Thomas; Bluth, Thomas; Koch, Thea; Gama de Abreu, Marcelo; Huhle, Robert",Intensive Care Med Exp,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7746431/,273
16290,This Month in JAAD: May 2021,2021-03-22,"Bone morphogenetic protein two (BMP-2) has been widely used as an osteoinductive agent in the treatment of bone diseases. However, some side effects, such as osteoclast activation have emerged when it was used at high doses. In this study, by considering the osteoclast-suppressing capability of melatonin (MEL), its effect on osteoclast differentiation induced by BMP-2 was investigated. These two factors, MEL and BMP-2, were embedded into chitosan/hydroxyapatite (HAp) scaffolds that were characterized morphologically by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and micro-computed tomography (μ-CT). Release profiles of MEL and BMP-2 from scaffolds were determined in vitro and then, the differentiation of RAW 264.7 cells to osteoclasts was investigated on the scaffolds. Results of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining, SEM imaging and expression of cathepsin K gene showed that, in the presence of BMP-2, osteoclast differentiation increased, whereas it decreased in MEL and MEL/BMP-2 embedded scaffolds suggesting that melatonin successfully attenuated osteoclast differentiation induced by BMP-2. Thus, the MEL/BMP-2 loaded chitosan/HAp scaffolds that have dual function in enhancing bone formation and inhibiting osteoclast activity are recommended biomaterials in the field of bone regeneration.

17667,Efficiency of fine scale and spatial regression in modelling associations between healthcare service spatial accessibility and their utilization,2021-05-19,"BACKGROUND: requires training and validation to standards expected of humans. We developed an online platform and established the Unity Collaborative to build a dataset of expertise from 17 hospitals for training, validation, and standardization of such techniques. METHODS: The training dataset consisted of 2056 individual frames drawn at random from 1265 parasternal long-axis video-loops of patients undergoing clinical echocardiography in 2015 to 2016. Nine experts labeled these images using our online platform. From this, we trained a convolutional neural network to identify keypoints. Subsequently, 13 experts labeled a validation dataset of the end-systolic and end-diastolic frame from 100 new video-loops, twice each. The 26-opinion consensus was used as the reference standard. The primary outcome was precision SD, the SD of the differences between AI measurement and expert consensus. RESULTS: In the validation dataset, the AI’s precision SD for left ventricular internal dimension was 3.5 mm. For context, precision SD of individual expert measurements against the expert consensus was 4.4 mm. Intraclass correlation coefficient between AI and expert consensus was 0.926 (95% CI, 0.904–0.944), compared with 0.817 (0.778–0.954) between individual experts and expert consensus. For interventricular septum thickness, precision SD was 1.8 mm for AI (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.809; 0.729–0.967), versus 2.0 mm for individuals (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.641; 0.568–0.716). For posterior wall thickness, precision SD was 1.4 mm for AI (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.535 [95% CI, 0.379–0.661]), versus 2.2 mm for individuals (0.366 [0.288–0.462]). We present all images and annotations. This highlights challenging cases, including poor image quality and tapered ventricles. CONCLUSIONS: Experts at multiple institutions successfully cooperated to build a collaborative AI. This performed as well as individual experts. Future echocardiographic AI research should use a consensus of experts as a reference.

21064,Understanding the maternal and child health system response to payment for performance in Tanzania using a causal loop diagram approach,2021-09-11,"BACKGROUND: Many patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) suffer from cognitive impairment after hospital discharge. Different mechanisms have been implicated as potential causes for this impairment, inter alia cerebral inflammation. A class of drugs with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties are β-HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors (“statins”). We hypothesized that treatment with rosuvastatin attenuates cerebral cytokine mRNA expression and nitro-oxidative stress in an animal model of acute lung injury. METHODS: After approval of the institutional and state animal care committee, we performed this prospective randomized controlled animal study in accordance with the international guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals. Thirty-two healthy male pigs were randomized to one of four groups: lung injury by central venous injection of oleic acid (n = 8), statin treatment before and directly after lung injury (n = 8), statin treatment after lung injury (n = 8), or ventilation-only controls (n = 8). About 18 h after lung injury and standardized treatment, the animals were euthanised, and the brains and lungs were collected for further examinations. We determined histologic lung injury and cerebral and pulmonal cytokine and 3-nitrotyrosine production. RESULTS: We found a significant increase in hippocampal IL-6 mRNA after lung injury (p < 0.05). Treatment with rosuvastatin before and after induction of lung injury led to a significant reduction of hippocampal IL-6 mRNA (p < 0.05). Cerebral 3-nitrotyrosine was significantly higher in lung-injured animals compared with all other groups (p < 0.05 vs. animals treated with rosuvastatin after lung injury induction; p < 0.001 vs. all other groups). 3-Nitrotyrosine was also increased in the lungs of the lung-injured pigs compared to all other groups (p < 0.05 each). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight cerebral cytokine production and nitro-oxidative stress within the first day after induction of lung injury. The treatment with rosuvastatin reduced IL-6 mRNA and 3-nitrotyrosine concentration in the brains of the animals. In earlier trials, statin treatment did not reduce mortality in ARDS patients but seemed to improve quality of life in ARDS survivors. Whether this is attributable to better cognitive function because of reduced nitro-oxidative stress and inflammation remains to be elucidated.

This study identified the main compounds(s) and mechanism(s) of the C. maackii flower against cancer via network pharmacology. The bioactives from the C. maackii flower were revealed by gas chromatography-mass spectrum (GC-MS), and SwissADME evaluated their physicochemical properties. Next, target(s) associated with the obtained bioactives or cancer-related targets were retrieved by public databases, and the Venn diagram selected the overlapping targets. The networks between overlapping targets and bioactives were visualized, constructed, and analyzed by RPackage. Finally, we implemented a molecular docking test (MDT) to explore key target(s) and compound(s) on AutoDockVina and LigPlot+. GC-MS detected a total of 34 bioactives and all were accepted by Lipinski’s rules and therefore classified as drug-like compounds (DLCs). A total of 597 bioactive-related targets and 4245 cancer-related targets were identified from public databases. The final 51 overlapping targets were selected between the bioactive targets network and cancer-related targets. With Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment, a total of 20 signaling pathways were manifested, and a hub signaling pathway (PI3K-Akt signaling pathway), a key target (Akt1), and a key compound (Urs-12-en-24-oic acid, 3-oxo, methyl ester) were selected among the 20 signaling pathways via MDT. Overall, Urs-12-en-24-oic acid, 3-oxo, methyl ester from the C. maackii flower has potent anti-cancer efficacy by inactivating Akt1 on the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway.","Oh, Ki-Kwang; Adnan, Md.; Cho, Dong-Ha",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8513069/,273

32473,"Nurses play a key role in meeting various human health challenges: —An exclusive interview with Xinjuan Wu, President of the Chinese Nursing Association",2020-04-10,"INTRODUCTION: Since December 2019, more than 925,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported worldwide, 8,251 cases in Portugal by the end of March. Previous studies related to the SARS pandemic showed a decrease up to 80% in the emergency care episodes. Hence, the objective of this study is to analyze the use of emergency services during the first pandemic month, compared to historical records. METHODS: Data from emergency episodes in mainland Portugal, from January 2014 to March 2020, were downloaded from the National Health Service (NHS) Transparency Portal and the NHS monitoring website. The evolution of emergency services from March to September 2020 was forecasted based on historical data from January 2014 to February 2020. Information for March 2020 was forecasted globally, by the Regional Health Administration (RHA) and Manchester Triage System (MTS). RESULTS: Compared with forecasted values, there was a 48% reduction in the number of emergency episodes in March 2020. In the analysis by the RHA, Alentejo had the smallest decrease in the number of episodes; interestingly, Alentejo is also the area with fewer COVID-19 cases in mainland Portugal. In the analysis by the MTS, the episodes classified as yellow showed the highest reduction (50%). For episodes classified as urgent, there is a difference of about 144,000 episodes during March 2020. DISCUSSION: The results of this preliminary study are aligned with the evidence produced for previous pandemics. Data about the use of emergency services, demographic and clinical characteristics of the episodes would be relevant to analyze this reduction. CONCLUSION: There was a significant drop in the number of emergency service use in March 2020, and although the causes of this reduction are not determined, the association between the beginning of the pandemic and the reduction of demand is evident. Understanding this phenomenon is crucial to plan interventions to avoid unnecessary morbidities or deaths, caused by a delayed visit to the emergency department.","Santana, Rui; Sousa, Joana Santos; Soares, Patrícia; Lopes, Sílvia; Boto, Paulo; Rocha, João Victor",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206358/,273

We aimed to identify subtypes of pediatric ARDS based on whole blood transcriptomics. METHODS: This was a prospective observational study of children with ARDS at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) between January 2018 and June 2019. We collected blood within 24 h of ARDS onset, generated expression profiles, and performed k-means clustering to identify sub-phenotypes. We tested the association between sub-phenotypes and PICU mortality and ventilator-free days at 28 days using multivariable logistic and competing risk regression, respectively. RESULTS: We enrolled 106 subjects, of whom 96 had usable samples. We identified three sub-phenotypes, dubbed CHOP ARDS Transcriptomic Subtypes (CATS) 1, 2, and 3. CATS-1 subjects (n = 31) demonstrated persistent hypoxemia, had ten subjects (32%) with immunocompromising conditions, and 32% mortality. CATS-2 subjects (n = 29) had more immunocompromising diagnoses (48%), rapidly resolving hypoxemia, and 24% mortality. CATS-3 subjects (n = 36) had the fewest comorbidities and also had rapidly resolving hypoxemia and 8% mortality. The CATS-3 subtype was associated with lower mortality (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.04–0.86) and higher probability of extubation (subdistribution HR 2.39, 95% CI 1.32–4.32), relative to CATS-1 after adjustment for confounders. CONCLUSIONS: We identified three sub-phenotypes of pediatric ARDS using whole blood transcriptomics. The sub-phenotypes had divergent clinical characteristics and prognoses.

44168,Editorial: Caregiving and Social Support in the Context of Health and Illness,2020-12-23,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes increased mortality and morbidity in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease. Elevated cardiac troponin I (cTnI) can suggest either a co-concurrent myocarditis or acute myocardial infarction. Understanding how laboratory values predict disease severity is important for clinicians to guide therapy and triage patients. METHODS: A cross sectional study was performed utilizing the 184 hospital United States database of HCA. Patients were selected based on inpatient visits to HCA facilities from February 2020 to May 2020 with a COVID-19 diagnosis and at least one cTnI lab test. Patients were divided according to an elevated or normal cTnI value based on the 99th percentile reference range of the test. Outcomes, such as length of stay, disposition, and time on the ventilator, were compared. RESULTS: 3968 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were identified. Of those, 3158 patients had at least one cTnI test throughout their hospitalization. 829 (26%) had at least one positive cTnI during their hospitalization. Patients with at least one positive cTnI were hospitalized on average for 8.7 days, whereas patients without positive cTnI were hospitalized on average for 6.3 days (p< 0.0001). 1499 patients without positive cTnI were sent home without health care, but only 196 with positive cTnI were discharged home without requiring home health (p < 0.0001). Need for mechanical ventilation was also higher in the elevated cTnI group. If intubated, patients in both groups required on average the same amount of ventilator time, 7 days (p = 0.7263). Ventilation time between COVID-19 patients with and without elevated Troponins [Image: see text] Length of hospitalization stay between COVID-19 patient with and without elevated Troponins [Image: see text] Differences in discharge between COVID-19 patients with and without elevated Troponins [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Patients with at least one positive cTnI during their hospitalization had increased length of stay and decreased likelihood of being discharged home without home health. Using a large nationwide database we confirmed previously published findings in smaller patient populations associating cardiovascular disease with COVID-19 severity. Once patients were intubated, both subsets of patients with and without elevated cTnI had similar days on the ventilator, suggesting the COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has a more complicated relationship to troponin levels. These findings suggest that patients with an increased cTnI should be triaged to receive aggressive management.

But the use of virtual platforms may affect the privacy of users data. This present study has a twofold objective: first check if the privacy of users when using TripAdvisor, the world’s largest travel platform, has an impact on their satisfaction and trust on the platform. Secondly, the relationship between E-WOM and the variables users trust and satisfaction when using TripAdvisor is examined. In order to achieve the objectives set out, the sample of 390 persons was analyzed. The PLS-SEM method has been used to process the data and test the hypotheses. The results of the analysis have shown that there is a positive and direct relationship between TripAdvisor users’ privacy and satisfaction. The direct and positive relationship between users’ E-WOM and their degree of satisfaction and trust toward the platform has also been confirmed.

We report a case of PRES-like syndrome in ET. Case Report: A 60-year-old man with a history of hypertension and thrombocythemia presented with progressive visual loss after waking up; and neurological examination showed pupils were 3 mm and equally reactive to light, which suggested cortical blindness. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed restricted diffusion in diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in the bilateral parietal and occipital lobes. Routine blood tests revealed a platelet count of 1,044 × 10(9)/L. ET was diagnosed after exclusion of other causes. Electroencephalography (EEG) showed periodic triphasic waves in the occipital region. The lesions of the parietal and occipital lobes on MRI and periodic triphasic waves of EEG disappeared quickly, and patient's vision returned to normal after the treatment with hydroxyurea and sodium bicarbonate. The patient experienced hallucinatory palinopsia during the recovery of vision.

The present study was designed to evaluate different intra-abdominal transplantation sites in the baboon to gain further knowledge about alternative transplantation sites in a human setting. METHODS Autologous fresh OCTs were performed in 12 baboons (Papio anubis). Four different sites were tested: the free portion of the omentum (OMF), the portion of the omentum adjacent to the spleen (OMS), the pouch of Douglas (D) and the pelvic wall on the psoas muscle (PW). Cortex survival, follicle density, cyclicity and hormonal levels were compared between the different sites, 3 and 6 months after transplantation. RESULTS Macroscopically, antral follicles were only found in the OMS and OMF locations, which also showed a higher proportion of follicle-containing cortex at light microscopy (OMF 71.4%, OMS 83.3% versus PW 58.8% and D 40%, P< 0.05). Higher densities of primordial [OMF: 3.54 (0-13.18) follicles/grid, OMS: 3.85 (0-8.53), PW: 0 (0-13.25), D 0 (0-1.33), P< 0.05] and primary follicles [OMF: 3.54 (0-18.52), OMS: 3.85 (0-1), PW: 0 (0-4.58), D 0 (0-0.25), P< 0.05] was also found in the omental locations.

However, although situational influences on complexity have been discussed at length in the literature, there is still no comprehensive integration of evidence regarding the theorized trait component of cognitive complexity. To fill this gap, we evaluate the degree that cognitive complexity is attributable to trait variance. Specifically, we review two domains of evidence pertaining to (a) the generalizability of individuals' complex thinking across domains and the temporal stability of individuals' complex thinking and (b) the relationship of complex thinking with conceptually related traits. Cumulatively, the literature suggests that persons' cognitive complexity at any point in time results partially from a stable and generalizable trait component that accounts for a small-to-moderate amount of variance. It further suggests that cognitively complex persons are characterized by chronic trait-based differences in motivation and ability to think complexly.","Woodard, Shailee R; Chan, Linus; Conway, Lucian Gideon","Personality and social psychology review : an official journal of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc",https://doi.org/10.1177/1088868320972299; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33451276/,273
60870,Well-being of the global anesthesiologist.,2021-01-01,"OBJECTIVE The objective was to critically assess the current evidence investigating the efficacy of using a positive pressure device in patients with definite or probable Menière's disease. METHODS We performed a systematic literature search in MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO up to February 2018. We included both systematic reviews and primary literature [randomized controlled trials (RCTs)] investigating positive pressure treatment, in patients (≥ 18 years of age), with Menière's disease. We assessed the internal validity of systematic reviews using the AMSTAR tool and risk of bias of primary studies using the Cochrane Risk of bias tool. We performed a meta-analysis for each outcome based on the identified studies. The overall certainty of evidence for the outcomes was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE). RESULTS The search for systematic reviews identified four relevant reviews. These all included the same four RCTs. An updated search identified one additional RCT. In total, five RCTs were included in the data synthesis. Our data synthesis showed no effect of positive pressure treatment on primary nor secondary outcomes. No serious adverse events were reported. The overall certainty of evidence ranged from very low to low, due to the serious risk of bias and imprecision. CONCLUSION The current available evidence does not support positive pressure device treatment in patients with Menière's disease. However, the limitations of the current literature hinder the possibility of any solid conclusion. There remains a need for randomized controlled trials of high quality to fully access the utility of this treatment.","Devantier, Louise; Guldfred, Frank Liviu-Adelin; Djurhuus, Bjarki Ditlev; Händel, Mina Nicole; Schmidt, Jesper Hvass; Hougaard, Dan Dupont; Edemann-Callesen, Henriette",European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00405-019-05359-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30809697/,273
61241,"Response to the COVID-19 epidemic: a report from Shenzhen, China.",2020-04-30,"Calf gastrointestinal disease remains one of the main causes of productivity and economic losses on dairy operations. The majority of pre-weaned calf mortality is attributed to diarrhea or other digestive problems. Five enteric pathogens are commonly associated with diarrhea in dairy calves, including bovine rotavirus, bovine coronavirus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., and Cryptosporidium parvum. Pathogen-associated differences in health outcomes and case fatality rates have not been well-characterized. Additionally, updated prevalence estimates may reflect important changes in the epidemiology of the pathogens on dairy farms. For this cohort study, fecal samples were collected from 276 clinically ill calves across 5 central Ohio dairy farms on the first day of diarrheal diagnosis. Genomic techniques, including reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) were used to test for the presence of the five enteric pathogens. A Poisson regression model was used to estimate the relative risk of mortality, and a survival analysis with a Cox regression model was used to analyze time to return to a healthy clinical status by pathogen. Rotavirus was the most frequently identified at 68.1 % (188/276), followed by F5 (K99)+E. coli at 42.5 % (114/268), C. parvum at 28.4 % (66/232), coronavirus at 5.8 % (16/276), and Salmonella had the lowest prevalence at 3.7 % (10/268). Risk of mortality tended to be higher for calves infected with Salmonella (RR = 3.83; 95 %CI: 0.93, 16.02, p = 0.062); however, the time to return to a healthy clinical status was not different for different pathogens. Only farm was a significant predictor of time to return to health (p = 0.017); the within-farm median duration of signs substantially varied between 2 and 7 days. The results suggest that the prevalence and distribution of rotaviral infections is higher than reported in prior studies. With the exception of infections caused by Salmonella spp., pathogen diagnosis on the first day of diarrhea was a poor predictor of the outcome and duration of disease. These results are critical to guide the implementation of prevention measures to detect, treat, and prevent calf diarrhea.","Barkley, James A; Pempek, Jessica A; Bowman, Andrew S; Nolting, Jacqueline M; Lee, Jiyoung; Lee, Seungjun; Habing, Gregory G",Preventive veterinary medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2021.105323; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33756433/,273
61279,Evaluating the association between urban green spaces and subjective well-being in Mexico city during the COVID-19 pandemic.,2021-06-14,"The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) regulates gene expression, governing aspects of homeostasis, but is also involved in cancer. Pharmacological GR activation is frequently used to alleviate therapy-related side-effects. While prior studies have shown GR activation might also have anti-proliferative action on tumours, the underpinnings of glucocorticoid action and its direct effectors in non-lymphoid solid cancers remain elusive. Here, we study the mechanisms of glucocorticoid response, focusing on lung cancer. We show that GR activation induces reversible cancer cell dormancy characterised by anticancer drug tolerance, and activation of growth factor survival signalling accompanied by vulnerability to inhibitors. GR-induced dormancy is dependent on a single GR-target gene, CDKN1C, regulated through chromatin looping of a GR-occupied upstream distal enhancer in a SWI/SNF-dependent fashion. These insights illustrate the importance of GR signalling in non-lymphoid solid cancer biology, particularly in lung cancer, and warrant caution for use of glucocorticoids in treatment of anticancer therapy related side-effects.","Prekovic, Stefan; Schuurman, Karianne; Mayayo-Peralta, Isabel; Manjón, Anna G; Buijs, Mark; Yavuz, Selçuk; Wellenstein, Max D; Barrera, Alejandro; Monkhorst, Kim; Huber, Anne; Morris, Ben; Lieftink, Cor; Chalkiadakis, Theofilos; Alkan, Ferhat; Silva, Joana; Győrffy, Balázs; Hoekman, Liesbeth; van den Broek, Bram; Teunissen, Hans; Debets, Donna O; Severson, Tesa; Jonkers, Jos; Reddy, Timothy; de Visser, Karin E; Faller, William; Beijersbergen, Roderick; Altelaar, Maarten; de Wit, Elzo; Medema, Rene; Zwart, Wilbert",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-24537-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34272384/,273

Traditional approaches usually rely on stimulated deformations of active materials under external electric/magnetic fields, which could potentially introduce parasitic side effects and lower device performances. Development of a rational strategy that allows access to high-performance 3D microdevices with multiple stable geometric configurations remains challenging. We introduce a mechanically guided scheme to build geometrically reconfigurable 3D mesostructures through a bottom-up design strategy based on a class of elementary reconfigurable structures with the simplest ribbon geometries. Quantitative mechanics modeling of the structural reconfigurability allows for the development of phase diagrams and design maps. Demonstrations of ~30 reconfigurable mesostructures with diverse geometric topologies and characteristic dimensions illustrate the versatile applicability.

This study examined changes in subjective wellbeing between December 2019 and May 2020 and how stress appraisals and coping strategies relate to individual differences and changes in subjective wellbeing during the early stages of the pandemic. Data were collected at 4 time points from 979 individuals in Germany. Results showed that, on average, life satisfaction, positive affect, and negative affect did not change significantly between December 2019 and March 2020 but decreased between March and May 2020. Across the latter timespan, individual differences in life satisfaction were positively related to controllability appraisals, active coping, and positive reframing, and negatively related to threat and centrality appraisals and planning. Positive affect was positively related to challenge and controllable-by-self appraisals, active coping, using emotional support, and religion, and negatively related to threat appraisal and humor. Negative affect was positively related to threat and centrality appraisals, denial, substance use, and self-blame, and negatively related to controllability appraisals and emotional support. Contrary to expectations, the effects of stress appraisals and coping strategies on changes in subjective wellbeing were small and mostly nonsignificant. These findings imply that the COVID-19 pandemic represents not only a major medical and economic crisis, but also has a psychological dimension, as it can be associated with declines in key facets of people's subjective wellbeing. Psychological practitioners should address potential declines in subjective wellbeing with their clients and attempt to enhance clients' general capability to use functional stress appraisals and effective coping strategies.

BACKGROUND Despite advances in endovascular treatment modalities, treatment of calcified lesions remains a challenge. METHODS A total of 133 subjects with 168 moderate to severely calcified lesions were enrolled. Lesions were treated with directional atherectomy devices, coupled with distal embolic protection. RESULTS The 30-day freedom from MAE rate was 93.1%. Per angiographic core laboratory assessment, the primary effectiveness endpoint (≤50% residual diameter stenosis) was achieved in 92.0% (lower confidence bound of 87.6%) of lesions. By core lab analysis, these results did not achieve the success criteria (90%) for the primary effectiveness objective. Per site assessment, the objective was met with the endpoint being achieved in 97.0% (lower confidence bound 93.8%). A mean residual diameter stenosis of 33.3% was achieved with the directional atherectomy device. This was further decreased to 24.1% with the use of adjunctive therapy. The proportion of asymptomatic subjects [Rutherford Clinical Category (RCC) = 0] increased from 0% at baseline to 52.3% at the 30-day follow-up visit. In total, 88.5% of subjects experienced an improvement of one or more Rutherford categories.

Patients can present with headache, ischaemic stroke, subarachnoid haemorrhage, or symptoms associated with mass effect, mostly on the brainstem. Although intracranial artery dissection is less common than cervical artery dissection in adults of European ethnic origin, intracranial artery dissection is reportedly more common in children and in Asian populations. Risk factors and mechanisms are poorly understood, and diagnosis is challenging because characteristic imaging features can be difficult to detect in view of the small size of intracranial arteries. Therefore, multimodal follow-up imaging is often needed to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment of intracranial artery dissections is empirical in the absence of data from randomised controlled trials. Most patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage undergo surgical or endovascular treatment to prevent rebleeding, whereas patients with intracranial artery dissection and cerebral ischaemia are treated with antithrombotics. Prognosis seems worse in patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage than in those without.","Debette, Stéphanie; Compter, Annette; Labeyrie, Marc-Antoine; Uyttenboogaart, Maarten; Metso, Tina M; Majersik, Jennifer J; Goeggel-Simonetti, Barbara; Engelter, Stefan T; Pezzini, Alessandro; Bijlenga, Philippe; Southerland, Andrew M; Naggara, Olivier; Béjot, Yannick; Cole, John W; Ducros, Anne; Giacalone, Giacomo; Schilling, Sabrina; Reiner, Peggy; Sarikaya, Hakan; Welleweerd, Janna C; Kappelle, L Jaap; de Borst, Gert Jan; Bonati, Leo H; Jung, Simon; Thijs, Vincent; Martin, Juan J; Brandt, Tobias; Grond-Ginsbach, Caspar; Kloss, Manja; Mizutani, Tohru; Minematsu, Kazuo; Meschia, James F; Pereira, Vitor M; Bersano, Anna; Touzé, Emmanuel; Lyrer, Philippe A; Leys, Didier; Chabriat, Hugues; Markus, Hugh S; Worrall, Bradford B; Chabrier, Stéphane; Baumgartner, Ralph; Stapf, Christian; Tatlisumak, Turgut; Arnold, Marcel; Bousser, Marie-Germaine",The Lancet.

We have described a closed-loop fluid management system based on stroke volume variation and stroke volume monitoring. The goal of this system is to apply GDFT protocols automatically. After conducting simulation, engineering, and animal studies the present report describes the first use of this system in the clinical setting. STUDY DESIGN Prospective pilot study. PATIENTS Patients undergoing major surgery. METHODS Twelve patients at two institutions had intraoperative GDFT delivered by closed-loop controller under the direction of an anaesthesiologist. Compliance with GDFT management was defined as acceptable when a patient spent more than 85% of the surgery time in a preload independent state (defined as stroke volume variation<13%), or when average cardiac index during the case was superior or equal to 2.5l/min/m(2). RESULTS Closed-loop GDFT was completed in 12 patients. Median surgery time was 447 [309-483] min and blood loss was 200 [100-1000] ml. Average cardiac index was 3.2±0.8l/min/m(2) and on average patients spent 91% (76 to 100%) of the surgery time in a preload independent state. Twelve of 12 patients met the criteria for compliance with intraoperative GDFT management. CONCLUSION Intraoperative GDFT delivered by closed-loop system under anaesthesiologist guidance allowed to obtain targeted objectives in 91% of surgery time. This approach may provide a way to ensure consistent high-quality delivery of fluid administration and compliance with perioperative goal directed therapy.","Rinehart, J; Le Manach, Y; Douiri, H; Lee, C; Lilot, M; Le, K; Canales, C; Cannesson, M",Annales francaises d'anesthesie et de reanimation,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annfar.2013.11.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24378044/,273

The patients have a dismal prognosis which has not improved in more than a decade suggesting that better understanding of this disease is required. In this study we analyze two previously published RNA sequencing datasets and gain further insights into the global transcriptome of two known sub-groups of this disease, which are characterized by the presence or absence of a homeobox gene expression signature. Specifically, we identify a remarkable mutually exclusive expression of the HOXA9/HOXA10 and IRX1 genes and have thus termed the two sub-groups iALL-HOXA9 and iALL-IRX1. This expression pattern is of critical importance as it suggests that there is a fundamental difference between the two sub-groups. Investigation of the transcriptome of the two sub-groups reveals a more aggressive nature of the iALL-IRX1 group, which is further supported by the fact that patients within this group have a worse prognosis and are also diagnosed at a younger age. This could be reflective of a developmentally earlier cell of origin for iALL-IRX1. Our analysis further uncovers critical differences between the two groups that may impact on treatment strategies for the two groups. In summary, through a detailed investigation into the transcriptional profile of iALL-HOXA9 and iALL-IRX1 patients, we highlight the importance of acknowledging that these two sub-groups are different, and that this is of clinical importance.","Symeonidou, V; Ottersbach, K",Experimental hematology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exphem.2020.10.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069783/,273

Even systems with universal access to healthcare (such as the UK's NHS) can only mitigate some consequences of health inequalities. Instead substantial societal measures are required both to reduce harmful exposures and to improve standards of housing, education, work, nutrition and exercise. The case for such measures is widely accepted among healthcare professionals but, in wider discourse, scepticism has remained about the role of government and society in improving life chances along with the belief that responsibility for health and wellbeing should rest with individuals themselves. The stark inequalities exposed by the coronavirus pandemic could be an opportunity to challenge this thinking. This paper argues that doctors should do more to persuade others of the need to address health inequalities and that to achieve this, it is important to understand the ethical and philosophical perspectives that are sceptical of such measures. An approach to gaining greater support for interventions to address health inequalities is presented along with reflections on effective political advocacy which is consistent with physicians' professional values.","Bradley, Stephen H",Clinical medicine,https://doi.org/10.7861/clinmed.2020-0945; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33762377/,273

72161,The health of healthcare professionals coping with the Covid-19 pandemic.,2020-09-01,"With the development of regenerative medicine, tissue repair at the molecular, cellular, tissue, and organ level has seen continuous improvements over traditional techniques. As the core of tissue repair, seed cells are widely used in various fields of regenerative medicine. However, their use is still associated with problems such as decreased cell survival and regeneration capacity after transplantation, immune rejection, and ethical concerns. Therefore, it is difficult to universally and safely apply stem cell banks for regenerative medicine. The paracrine effects of cells, especially secretion of exosomes, play vital roles in cell communication, immune response, angiogenesis, scar formation, tissue repair, and other biological functions. Exosomes are a type of nanoscale extracellular vesicle that contain biologically active molecules such as RNA and proteins; therefore, exosomes can replicate the functions of their parental cells. Meanwhile, exosomes can be used as nanocarriers to deliver active factors or small molecules to promote tissue repair. Preclinical studies of exosomes in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine have been carried in the fields of bone/cartilage repair, nerve regeneration, liver and kidney regeneration, skin repair, vascular tissue regeneration, etc. This review introduces exosomes from the aspects of biogenesis, composition, identification, and isolation, and focuses on the development status of scaffold materials for exosome delivery. In addition, we highlight examples of exosome-laden scaffolds for preclinical applications in tissue repair. We look forward to the broad application prospects of exosome-laden scaffolds.","Huang, Jianghong; Xiong, Jianyi; Yang, Lei; Zhang, Jun; Sun, Shuqing; Liang, Yujie",Nanoscale,https://doi.org/10.1039/d1nr01314a; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33969373/,273

Coronaviruses evolve by accumulation of point mutations and recombination of genomes among different strains or species. Mammalian coronaviruses including those infect humans are evolved from bat coronaviruses. While SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are genetically closely related to bat coronaviruses, intermediate host(s) is (are) likely to be involved in the emergence and cross-species transmission of these novel human viruses. High prevalence of SARS-like coronaviruses have been found from masked palm civet cats and raccoon dogs collected from markets around the time of outbreaks in humans, but these animals are likely to be a transient accidental host rather than a persisting reservoir. More research is needed to elucidate the ecology of coronaviruses.

METHODS This was a prospective, cross-sectional, analytic study conducted at HDU/ICU of District Headquarter Hospital, Faisalabad, Pakistan, from May through July 2020. Sixty-three eligible patients, admitted to the HDU/ICU, were prospectively enrolled in the study. Their NLR, C-reactive protein, serum albumin, and serum fibrinogen were measured. Patients' demographic characteristics, comorbidities, clinical manifestations of COVID-19 infection, medication use, and history of lung malignancy were retrieved from their medical history. Patients were categorized into either a general group (with mild COVID-19) or a heavy group (with moderate to severe COVID-19). RESULTS There were significant differences between the two groups in diabetes prevalence, NLR, C-reactive protein, and serum albumin. NLR and C-reactive protein were positively correlated (P < 0.001, P = 0.04 respectively) whereas serum albumin was negatively correlated (P = 0.009) with severe COVID-19. NLR was found to be an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19 pneumonia in the heavy group (OR = 1.264, 95% CI: 1.046~1.526, P = 0.015). The calculated AUC using ROC for NLR was 0.831, with an optimal limit of 4.795, sensitivity of 0.83 and specificity of 0.75, which is highly suggestive of NLR being a marker for early detection of deteriorating severe COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION NLR can be used as an early warning signal for deteriorating severe COVID-19 infection and can provide an objective basis for early identification and management of severe COVID-19 pneumonia.","Imran, Mehr Muhammad; Ahmed, Umair; Usman, Umer; Ali, Majid; Shaukat, Aamir; Gul, Noor",International journal of clinical practice,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.13698; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32892477/,273

Cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) have been shown to possess antiviral properties, and their polymorphisms are associated with disease outcome. The aim was to investigate the association of gene polymorphisms in IL-10, IFN-γ, and TNF-α with CMV infection in RTRs. METHODS IL-10 -1082 A>G, -592 A>C; TNF-α -308 A>G; and IFN-γ +874 A>T gene polymorphisms were studied in 247 Hispanic RTRs (52 RTRs with CMV infection and 195 without CMV infection), using DNA-based polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers and restriction. RESULTS Median time to CMV infection was 8 months, with a mean peak CMV viral load of 25,314 copies/mL. Patients with donor-positive/recipient-negative (D+/R-) serostatus were found to be associated with a high risk of CMV infection (P = 0.001). A statistically significant correlation was found between IFN-γ +874 A>T polymorphism and the risk of CMV infection. The IFN-γ +874 AA genotype was associated with a 3.4-fold increased risk for the CMV-infected group compared to the non-CMV group (odds ratio = 3.4, 95% confidence interval = 1.24-9.34, P = 0.01). The association was independently significant in multiple logistic regression (P = 0.01), along with serologic status D+/R-, acute rejection, and anti-thymocyte globulin induction. The allelic as well as genotypic frequencies of TNF-α and IL-10 did not significantly differ between the CMV-infection group and the control group. Individuals with IFN-γ +874 AT and AA genotypes exhibited higher risk of allograft loss. CONCLUSION This study suggested that RTRs with variant homozygous IFN-γ AA genotype were at risk of CMV infection, whereas the high producer IFN-γ +874 TT genotype appears to be associated with lower risk of CMV infection.","Vu, D; Shah, T; Ansari, J; Sakharkar, P; Yasir, Q; Naraghi, R; Hutchinson, I; Min, D",Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/tid.12285; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25208755/,273

77496,Online health survey research during COVID-19.,2021-02-01,"INTRODUCTION Thrombus density may be a predictor for acute ischemic stroke treatment success. However, only limited data on observer variability for thrombus density measurements exist. This study assesses the variability and bias of four common thrombus density measurement methods by expert and non-expert observers. METHODS For 132 consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke, three experts and two trained observers determined thrombus density by placing three standardized regions of interest (ROIs) in the thrombus and corresponding contralateral arterial segment. Subsequently, absolute and relative thrombus densities were determined using either one or three ROIs. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was determined, and Bland-Altman analysis was performed to evaluate interobserver and intermethod agreement. Accuracy of the trained observer was evaluated with a reference expert observer using the same statistical analysis. RESULTS The highest interobserver agreement was obtained for absolute thrombus measurements using three ROIs (ICCs ranging from 0.54 to 0.91). In general, interobserver agreement was lower for relative measurements, and for using one instead of three ROIs. Interobserver agreement of trained non-experts and experts was similar. Accuracy of the trained observer measurements was comparable to the expert interobserver agreement and was better for absolute measurements and with three ROIs. The agreement between the one ROI and three ROI methods was good. CONCLUSION Absolute thrombus density measurement has superior interobserver agreement compared to relative density measurement. Interobserver variation is smaller when multiple ROIs are used. Trained non-expert observers can accurately and reproducibly assess absolute thrombus densities using three ROIs.","Santos, Emilie M M; Yoo, Albert J; Beenen, Ludo F; Berkhemer, Olvert A; den Blanken, Mark D; Wismans, Carrie; Niessen, Wiro J; Majoie, Charles B; Marquering, Henk A",Neuroradiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00234-015-1607-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26494462/,273

We present a novel endovascular treatment method for large and giant cerebral aneurysms called the ""maze-making and solving"" technique and compare the short-term follow-up results of this technique with those of conventional coil embolization. MATERIALS AND METHODS Eight patients (65 ± 11.5 years of age, 7 women) with large/giant unruptured nonthrombosed cerebral aneurysm (mean largest aneurysm dimension, 19 ± 4.4 mm) were treated by the maze-making and solving technique, a combination of the double-catheter technique and various assisted techniques. The coil-packing attenuation, postoperative courses, and recurrence rate of this maze group were compared with 30 previous cases (conventional group, 65.4 ± 13.0 years of age; 22 women; mean largest aneurysm dimension, 13.4 ± 3.8 mm). RESULTS Four maze group cases were Raymond class 1; and 4 were class 2 as indicated by immediate postsurgical angiography. No perioperative deaths or major strokes occurred. Mean packing attenuation of the maze group was significantly higher than that of the conventional group (37.4 ± 5.9% versus 26.2 ± 5.6%). Follow-up angiography performed at 11.3 ± 5.4 months revealed no recurrence in the maze group compared with 39.2% in the conventional group. CONCLUSIONS The maze-making and solving technique achieves high coil-packing attenuation for efficient embolization of large and giant cerebral aneurysms with a low risk of recurrence.","Ohta, T; Nakahara, I; Ishibashi, R; Matsumoto, S; Gomi, M; Miyata, H; Nishi, H; Watanabe, S; Nagata, I",AJNR.

77696,"Well-being Curriculum for Anesthesiology Residents: Development, Processes, and Preliminary Outcomes.",2020-11-03,"BACKGROUND Dengue fever is a ubiquitous arboviral infection in tropical and sub-tropical regions, whose incidence has increased over recent decades. In the absence of a rapid point of care test, the clinical diagnosis of dengue is complex. The World Health Organisation has outlined diagnostic criteria for making the diagnosis of dengue infection, which includes the use of the tourniquet test (TT). PURPOSE To assess the quality of the evidence supporting the use of the TT and perform a diagnostic accuracy meta-analysis comparing the TT to antibody response measured by ELISA. DATA SOURCES A comprehensive literature search was conducted in the following databases to April, 2016: MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, BIOSIS, Web of Science, SCOPUS. STUDY SELECTION Studies comparing the diagnostic accuracy of the tourniquet test with ELISA for the diagnosis of dengue were included. DATA EXTRACTION Two independent authors extracted data using a standardized form. DATA SYNTHESIS A total of 16 studies with 28,739 participants were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled sensitivity for dengue diagnosis by TT was 58% (95% Confidence Interval (CI), 43%-71%) and the specificity was 71% (95% CI, 60%-80%). In the subgroup analysis sensitivity for non-severe dengue diagnosis was 55% (95% CI, 52%-59%) and the specificity was 63% (95% CI, 60%-66%), whilst sensitivity for dengue hemorrhagic fever diagnosis was 62% (95% CI, 53%-71%) and the specificity was 60% (95% CI, 48%-70%). Receiver-operator characteristics demonstrated a test accuracy (AUC) of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.66-0.74).

Additionally, to identify factors indicative of an adequate ablation margin and predictors of local tumor progression (LTP). METHODS Fifty-nine HCCs in 29 patients were treated by RFA and followed-up for > 1 year (mean 37.9 months). Fusion images of pre- and post-ablation HBP series were created using a non-rigid registration and manual correlation. The ablation margin appearance was classified as ablation margin + (ablation margin completely surrounding the tumor), ablation margin-zero (a partially discontinuous ablation margin without protrusion of HCC), ablation margin-(a partially discontinuous ablation margin with protrusion of HCC), and indeterminate (index tumor was not visible). The minimal ablation margin was measured, and clinical factors were examined to identify other risk factors for LTP. RESULTS LTP was observed at follow-up in 12 tumors. The mean minimal ablation margin was 3.6 mm. Multivariate analysis revealed that the ablation margin status was the only significant factor (p = 0.028). The cumulative LTP rates (3.3%, 3.3%, and 3.3% at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively) in 30 ablation margin + nodules were significantly lower (p = 0.006) than those (20.0%, 28.0%, and 32.2% at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively) in 25 ablation margin-zero nodules. CONCLUSIONS Fusion images enable an early assessment of the ablation efficacy in the majority of HCCs. The ablation margin status is a significant factor for LTP.","Takeyama, Nobuyuki; Mizobuchi, Naruki; Sakaki, Masashi; Shimozuma, Yu; Munechika, Jiro; Kajiwara, Atsushi; Uchikoshi, Manabu; Uozumi, Syojiro; Ohgiya, Yoshimitsu; Gokan, Takehiko",Abdominal radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00261-018-1800-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30327828/,273

Hospital Kuala Lumpur, where thoracic procedures are performed, was badly affected. We describe our experience in performing aerosol generating procedures safely in thoracic surgery during the Covid-19 era. METHODS Medical records of patients who underwent thoracic surgery from March 18, 2020 to May 17, 2020 were reviewed retrospectively. All patients undergoing thoracic surgery were tested for Covid-19 using the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction method. Patients with malignancy were observed for 10 to 14 days in the ward after testing negative. The healthcare workers donned personal protective equipment for all the cases, and the number of healthcare workers in the operating room was limited to the minimum required. RESULTS A total of 44 procedures were performed in 26 thoracic surgeries. All of these procedures were classified as aerosol generating, and the mean duration of the surgery was 130 ± 43 minutes. None of the healthcare workers involved in the surgery were exposed or infected by Covid-19. CONCLUSION Covid-19 will be a threat for a long time and thoracic surgeons must continue to provide their services, despite having to deal with aerosol generating procedures, in the new normal.

METHODS Prospective mixed methods study in two primary care centres (eight GP surgeries). We collected anonymised service level data on all patients receiving OTVoc. Next, patient participants who met inclusion criteria and consented, undertook baseline and 3-month follow-up assessments. Interviews were also conducted to explore stakeholders' views- GPs, Nurse Practitioners, Front Desk Staff, Occupational Therapists, patients and their employers about OTVoc- and included study eligibility, referral, experiences and attitudes to return to work. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. RESULTS The majority of standardized measures showed some improvement over the study period: the sickness absence rate dropped from 71 to 15% and use of GP 'fit' notes reduced from 76 to 6%. Interview data indicated positive attitudes to OTVoc, the use of the fit note and the Allied Health Professions Health and Work Reports (AHP H&WRs). GPs felt that OTVoc reduced their workload. CONCLUSION Further research is feasible and warranted. OTVoc was positively received and stakeholders believed it was effective in getting patients back to work or preparing for their return.

Pre-transplant placement of tissue expanders (TE) can overcome this challenge; however it can be associated with life-threatening complications. This review aimed to comprehensively summarize all available literature on TE in ITx candidates and include the technical details of osmotic, self-inflatable TE -a technique undescribed before. PubMed, EMBASE and CCTR were searched until April 30, 2016. Based on structured data abstraction and detailed analysis, eighteen cases of TE (inflatable) in ITx candidates were found. Localisation of placement was: subcutaneously in 11; intraperitoneally in 4; 1 patient had 1 TE placed retromuscularly and 1 intraperitoneally; 1 patient had biplanar TE (intraperitoneally placed and extending retromuscularly) and in 1 localisation was unreported. Complication rate was high (61%), injection- or intraperitoneal-related, resulting in life-threatening infections/hematoma. With successful expansion, physiological graft protection -by skin+/-fascia- was always achieved. In completion of this review, we describe our own experience with two patients (7.5-, 34-year-old females), in whom osmotic TE were placed subcutaneously pre-ITx. No TE-related complications occurred and both patients underwent uncomplicated ITx with respectively primary skin and skin + fascia closure. The pros and cons of each TE type and placement are discussed, resulting in the overall conclusions that TE offer an important benefit in graft-protection following ITx. Osmotic TE are safer than conventional prostheses by avoiding percutaneous injections. Subcutaneous placement seems to be safer and more reliable.","Ceulemans, Laurens J; Deferm, Nathalie P; Miserez, Marc; Maione, Francesca; Monbaliu, Diethard; Pirenne, Jacques",Transplantation reviews,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trre.2016.07.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27477938/,273

MATERIAL AND METHODS Fifty-three patients with unilateral mild to severe SSNHL (≤90 dB HL at 0.5k, 1k, 2k, and 4 kHz, 4FA) were included. All patients received systemic high dose steroid therapy within one month after onset. The difference between the threshold levels measured by ASSR and PTA on the same day [ASSR - PTA] was calculated. The hearing recovery (HR) was defined as a < 30 dB HL of final degree of hearing loss and a > 15 dB HL of hearing gain. RESULTS The HR (+) group showed significantly worse ASSR predicted threshold than pure-tone threshold in univariate (t(51) = 2.412, p = .020) and multivariate analysis (OR 0.910, p = .012). The [ASSR - PTA] threshold showed significantly moderate correlation with hearing gain (r = -0.303, p = .028).

The identified differentially methylated regions were distributed evenly across the 10.5-kb-promoter regions covered by the array, and a substantial number localized to promoters of genes involved in immune regulation and autoimmunity. This study reveals a hypomethylated status in CD4+ T cells from AAD patients and indicates differential methylation of promoters of key genes involved in immune responses.","Bjanesoy, Trine E; Andreassen, Bettina Kulle; Bratland, Eirik; Reiner, Andrew; Islam, Shahinul; Husebye, Eystein S; Bakke, Marit",Molecular immunology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2014.02.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24667071/,273

82915,"Flawed NHS records skew ethnic health data, says study.",2021-06-07,"OBJECTIVES Following the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus and the subsequent global spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), health systems and the populations who use them have faced unprecedented challenges. We aimed to measure the impact of COVID-19 on the uptake of hospital-based care at a national level. DESIGN The study period (weeks ending 5 January to 28 June 2020) encompassed the pandemic announcement by the World Health Organization and the initiation of the UK lockdown. We undertook an interrupted time-series analysis to evaluate the impact of these events on hospital services at a national level and across demographics, clinical specialties and National Health Service Health Boards. SETTING Scotland, UK. PARTICIPANTS Patients receiving hospital care from National Health Service Scotland. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Accident and emergency (A&E) attendances, and emergency and planned hospital admissions measured using the relative change of weekly counts in 2020 to the averaged counts for equivalent weeks in 2018 and 2019. RESULTS Before the pandemic announcement, the uptake of hospital care was largely consistent with historical levels. This was followed by sharp drops in all outcomes until UK lockdown, where activity began to steadily increase. This time-period saw an average reduction of -40.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: -47.7 to -33.7) in A&E attendances, -25.8% (95% CI: -31.1 to -20.4) in emergency hospital admissions and -60.9% (95% CI: -66.1 to -55.7) in planned hospital admissions, in comparison to the 2018-2019 averages. All subgroup trends were broadly consistent within outcomes, but with notable variations across age groups, specialties and geography. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 has had a profoundly disruptive impact on hospital-based care across National Health Service Scotland. This has likely led to an adverse effect on non-COVID-19-related illnesses, increasing the possibility of potentially avoidable morbidity and mortality. Further research is required to elucidate these impacts.","Mulholland, Rachel H; Wood, Rachael; Stagg, Helen R; Fischbacher, Colin; Villacampa, Jaime; Simpson, Colin R; Vasileiou, Eleftheria; McCowan, Colin; Stock, Sarah J; Docherty, Annemarie B; Ritchie, Lewis D; Agrawal, Utkarsh; Robertson, Chris; Murray, Josephine Lk; MacKenzie, Fiona; Sheikh, Aziz",Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/0141076820962447; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33012218/,273
83607,Team Lavender: Supporting employee well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic.,2021-04-01,"Aiming at perfecting the proposed three-stage cascade-scrubbing desulfurization technology, ASPEN PLUS simulations of seawater/seawater cascade-scrubbing desulfurization for an exhaust gas scrubber designed for a 10-MW large-scale marine diesel engine were performed to fix a reasonable desulfurization share for the main scrubbing section. Accordingly, three typical desulfurization share setups of 80%, 85%, and 90% were compared under various operational conditions by varying the fuel-sulfur content, liquid/gas ratio, and seawater alkalinity. In complying with the desulfurization requirements of emission control areas, 85% was obtained as the optimal desulfurization share among the three setups. Again, under the selected 85% setup, the cascade-scrubbing desulfurization was numerically compared with the conventional once-through open-loop solution, so as to confirm the seawater-saving advantage of the cascade-scrubbing desulfurization technology used for the exhaust gas of large-scale marine diesels. At relatively higher sulfur content above 3.5%, the open-loop solution solely achieved the desulfurization requirements of non-emission control areas by using higher liquid/gas ratio levels of 6.5-8.0 L/Nm3, while fully failed to meet the much stricter requirements of emission control areas except the lowest 1.5% fuel-sulfur conditions. On the contrary, the cascade-scrubbing solution could meet the requirements of emission control areas under various fuel-sulfur content conditions and reduced the liquid/gas ratio by about 45%, in comparison to the open-loop solution.","Wu, Sili; Kuang, Min; Zhao, Minsen; Yang, Guohua; Geng, Xuewen; Hu, Xuehui; Huang, Jun",Environmental science and pollution research international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-12065-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411298/,273
84074,COVID-19 and People Who Use Drugs - A Commentary.,2020-10-01,"OBJECTIVES This study aims to explore the impacts of visibility and accessibility of alcohol gel-based hand sanitizer dispensers (HSDs) on healthcare workers' hand-hygiene (HH) behaviors. BACKGROUND Despite the importance of HH in reducing nosocomial infection, few empirical studies have quantitatively investigated the impacts of unit shape and size, and the resulted visibility and accessibility on HH, due to the lack of consistent methods to measure and evaluate visibility. METHODS The research was developed as a cross-sectional comparative study of two nursing units (Units A and B) with similar patient acuity and nursing care model but different shape and layout. The study applied quantitative research methods including visibility and accessibility analysis using space syntax, 1-week on-site observation, and secondary data analysis on HH compliance rates. RESULTS Results indicate that the unit with higher visibility and accessibility is associated with higher HH frequencies. Unit B has significantly higher visibility of HSDs, p < .001, t(60) = 4.615, and significantly higher frequency of HH activity occurrences, 5.17% versus 1.52%; p < .001, t(16.750) = 5.332, than Unit A, even though Unit B has lower HSD to bed ratio (0.708:1 vs. 1.375:1). The linear regression models also demonstrate that visibility and accessibility of HSDs are significant predictors of HH behavior. CONCLUSIONS Overall, this exploratory study identified the importance of visibility of HSDs to improve the chances of HH. It also points out the impacts of nursing unit typology on the visibility of HSDs and in turn affects HH behavior.","Cai, Hui; Tyne, Intisar Ameen; Spreckelmeyer, Kent; Williams, Jennifer",HERD,https://doi.org/10.1177/1937586720962506; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33000659/,273

To improve door-to-needle time (DNT), it is important to understand if (1) longer door-to-imaging time (DIT) results in longer DNT, (2) hospitals have different DIT performances, and (3) patient and hospital characteristics predict DIT. METHODS Prospectively collected data in the Safe Implementation of Treatments in Stroke-EAST (SITS-EAST) registry from Central/Eastern European countries between 2008 and 2011 were analyzed. Hospital characteristics were obtained by questionnaire from each center. Patient- and hospital-level predictors of DIT of 25 minutes or less were identified by the method of generalized estimating equations. RESULTS Altogether 6 of 9 SITS-EAST countries participated with 4212 patients entered into the database of which 3631 (86%) had all required variables. DIT of 25 minutes or less was achieved in 2464 (68%) patients (range, 3%-93%; median, 65%; and interquartile range, 50%-80% between centers). Patients with DIT of 25 minutes or less had shorter DNT (median, 60 minutes) than patients with DIT of more than 25 minutes (median, 86 minutes; P < .001). Four variables independently predicted DIT of 25 minutes or less: longer time from stroke onset to admission (91-180 versus 0-90 minutes; odds ratio [OR], 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-1.8), transport time of 5 minutes or less (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.7-4.7) between the place of admission and a computed tomography (CT) scanner, no or minimal neurologic deficit before stroke (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.02-1.5), and diabetes mellitus (OR, .8; 95% CI, .7-.97). CONCLUSIONS DIT should be improved in patients arriving early and late. Place of admission should allow transport time to a CT scanner under 5 minutes.","Haršány, Michal; Kadlecová, Pavla; Švigelj, Viktor; Kõrv, Janika; Kes, Vanja Bašić; Vilionskis, Aleksandras; Krespi, Yakup; Mikulík, Robert",Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2014.03.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25106830/,273

We sought to compare postoperative pain of patients who underwent laparoscopic inguinal herniorrhaphy using self-adhering polyester mesh to those who had non-adhering, synthetic mesh implanted using absorbable tacks. MATERIALS AND METHODS This study is a retrospective review of patients who underwent primary laparoscopic inguinal herniorrhaphy at the Medical College of Wisconsin between October 2012 and July 2014. Clinical information and perioperative pain scores using the visual analog scale (VAS) were obtained to evaluate immediate pre and postoperative pain. RESULTS A total of 98 patients (88 male) underwent laparoscopic inguinal herniorrhaphy during the study interval. Forty-two patients received self-adhering mesh and 56 patients received mesh secured with tacks. Patient demographics and comorbidities did not differ significantly between the two groups. There was no difference in preoperative VAS scores between groups. The self-adhering mesh patients had a lower mean VAS change score (less pain). Postoperative complications did not differ between groups apart from a higher observed incidence of seroma in the self-adhering mesh group (p = 0.04). No hernias recurred in either group during the study interval. CONCLUSIONS Self-adhering mesh in laparoscopic inguinal herniorrhaphy resulted in less immediate postoperative pain than tacked mesh as demonstrated by VAS score. Postoperative complications were similar between the two groups. The results of this study demonstrate that laparoscopic inguinal herniorrhaphy using self-adhering mesh is comparable to tacked mesh in regards to short-term complication rates, but show a favorable advantage in regards to immediate postoperative pain.","Davila, Daniel G; Helm, Melissa C; Pourladian, Irene S; Frelich, Matthew J; Kastenmeier, Andrew S; Gould, Jon C; Goldblatt, Matthew I",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-017-5787-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28840323/,273

88613,"Exploring the association between coronavirus stress, meaning in life, psychological flexibility, and subjective well-being .",2021-01-25,"Cytochrome P450 4F3 (CYP4F3), originally identified as one of the leukotriene B4 ω-hydroxylases, belongs to a CYP gene family that comprises several members, which participate in the metabolism of various endobiotics, as well as some xenobiotics. The CYP4F gene family is clustered in a 0.5-Mb stretch of genomic DNA on the p13 region of chromosome 19. Apart from the ω-hydroxylation of leukotriene B4 and prostaglandins, CYP4F3 is the main catalyst in the oxidation of fatty acid epoxides. CYP4F3 expression results from the synthesis of two distinct enzymes, CYP4F3A and CYP4F3B, which originate from the alternative splicing of a single pre-mRNA precursor molecule. Remarkably, the selection of either isoform is part of a tissue-specific control through which CYP3F3A is mostly expressed in leukocytes and CYP4F3B mostly in the liver. Recently, CYP4F3 single nucleotide polymorphisms have been incriminated in the onset of pathologies, including celiac or Crohn's diseases. Although much has been discovered in the regulation and function of CYP4F2, the closest CYP4F subfamily member, analyses of CYP4F3 enzymes lag somewhat behind in the field of our knowledge. In this short review, emphasis will be placed on the regulation and the functional roles of human CYP4F3.","Corcos, Laurent; Lucas, Danièle; Le Jossic-Corcos, Catherine; Dréano, Yvonne; Simon, Brigitte; Plée-Gautier, Emmanuelle; Amet, Yolande; Salaün, Jean-Pierre",Drug metabolism and drug interactions,https://doi.org/10.1515/dmdi-2011-0037; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22706230/,273

90038,"The Association of Interleukin-6 value, Interleukin inhibitors and Outcomes of Patients with COVID-19 in New York City.",2020-07-28,"BACKGROUND The authors present a novel mesh suture design aimed at minimizing the early laparotomy dehiscence that drives ventral hernia formation. The authors hypothesized that modulation of the suture-tissue interface through use of a macroporous structure and increased aspect ratio (width-to-height ratio) would decrease the suture pull-through that leads to laparotomy dehiscence. METHODS Incisional hernias were produced in 30 rats according to an established hernia model. The rat hernias were randomized to repair with either two 5-0 polypropylene sutures or two midweight polypropylene mesh sutures. Standardized photographs were taken before repair and 1 month after repair. Edge-detection software was used to define the border of the hernia defect and calculate the defect area. Histologic analysis was performed on all mesh suture specimens. RESULTS Seventeen hernias were repaired with mesh sutures and 13 were repaired with conventional sutures. The mean area of the recurrent defects following repair with mesh suture was 177.8 ± 27.1 mm2, compared with 267.3 ± 34.1 mm2 following conventional suture repair. This correlated to a 57.4 percent reduction in defect area after mesh suture repair, compared with a 10.1 percent increase in defect area following conventional suture repair (p < 0.0007). None (zero of 34) of the mesh sutures pulled through the surrounding tissue, whereas 65 percent (17 of 26) of the conventional sutures demonstrated complete pull-through. Excellent fibrocollagenous ingrowth was observed in 13 of 17 mesh suture specimens. CONCLUSIONS Mesh sutures better resisted suture pull-through than conventional polypropylene sutures. The design elements of mesh sutures may prevent early laparotomy dehiscence by more evenly distributing distracting forces at the suture-tissue interface and permitting tissue incorporation of the suture itself.","Souza, Jason M; Dumanian, Zari P; Gurjala, Anandev N; Dumanian, Gregory A",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/prs.0000000000000910; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25626817/,273

This can lead to under- or over-identification of DLD in this population. This study endeavors to contribute to overcoming this problem, by determining whether two specific clinical markers used with the Italian monolingual population can also be used with early L2 acquiring children, namely clitic production and non-word repetition. Our study involved two groups of 5-year-old L2 learners of Italian from various language backgrounds; 18 children had been referred to Speech and Language Therapy (SLT) services (EL2_DLD), and 30 children were typically developing (EL2_TD). The participants completed an Italian clitic production task and a non-word repetition task based on Italian phonotactics. Data was also collected from the participants' caregivers with the ALDeQ Parental Questionnaire to obtain information about the children's L1. Our results suggest that non-word repetition and clitic production in Italian are potentially useful for identifying L2 learners of Italian with DLD, at the age of 5 years. The repetition of non-words is highly accurate in identifying children with DLD among the participants, while clitic production is somewhat less discriminative in this sample. This study is a first step towards uncovering clinical markers that could be used to determine the presence of DLD in children acquiring their L2.","Guasti, Maria Teresa; White, Michelle J; Bianco, Gabriele; Arosio, Fabrizio; Camilleri, Bernard; Hasson, Natalie",Clinical linguistics & phonetics,https://doi.org/10.1080/02699206.2020.1830303; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33032455/,273
90759,"Translation, cross-cultural adaptation and psychometric evaluation of Brazilian Portuguese version of the 14-item Health Literacy Scale.",2020-07-08,"INTRODUCTION There is an increased risk of stroke in patients with cancer-this risk is particularly heightened around the time of cancer diagnosis, although no studies have systematically quantified this risk in the literature. Patients newly diagnosed with cancer without prior stroke represent a highly susceptible population in whom there is a window of opportunity to study and implement primary prevention strategies. Therefore, the objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to identify the cumulative incidence of ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes during the first year after a diagnosis of cancer. METHODS AND ANALYSIS MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed will be searched with the assistance from a medical information specialist, from 1980 until present. Eligible studies will include observational studies that have enrolled adult patients newly diagnosed with cancer and report outcomes of stroke during the first year of cancer diagnosis. We will exclude all randomized and non-randomized interventional studies. Data on participant characteristics, study design, baseline characteristics, and outcome characteristics will be extracted. Study quality will be assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cohort studies, and heterogeneity will be assessed using the I2 statistic. Pooled cumulative incidence will be calculated for ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes separately using a random-effects model. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION No formal research ethics approval is necessary as primary data collection will not be done. We will disseminate our findings through scientific conference presentations, peer-reviewed publications, and social media/the press. The findings from this review will inform clinicians and patients regarding the risk of stroke in patients newly diagnosed with cancer by quantifying the cumulative incidence of each subtype of stroke during the first year after a diagnosis of cancer. This represents a window of opportunity to implement prevention strategies in a susceptible population.

It stands to reason that the spread of the virus depends on sociocultural ecologies that facilitate or inhibit social contact. In particular, the community-level tendency to engage with strangers and freely choose friends, called relational mobility, creates increased opportunities to interact with a larger and more variable range of other people. It may therefore be associated with a faster spread of infectious diseases, including COVID-19. Here, we tested this possibility by analyzing growth curves of confirmed cases of and deaths due to COVID-19 in the first 30 days of the outbreaks in 39 countries. We found that growth was significantly accelerated as a function of a country-wise measure of relational mobility. This relationship was robust either with or without a set of control variables, including demographic variables, reporting bias, testing availability, and cultural dimensions of individualism, tightness, and government efficiency. Policy implications are also discussed.","Salvador, Cristina E; Berg, Martha K; Yu, Qinggang; San Martin, Alvaro; Kitayama, Shinobu",Psychological science,https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797620958118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32915703/,273

METHODS We queried the worldwide FDA Adverse Event Reporting System to extract SS records due to DDIs where linezolid was reported as suspect. For each serotonergic agent concomitantly reported, proportion of SS reports and mean number of DDIs were calculated and three different ""SS reporting zones"" were created. Relevant PK (peak concentration, area under plasma concentration curve, volume of distribution (VD), and lipophilicity) and PD (values of binding affinity (Ki) and IC50 for serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT) and 5-HT2A) parameters were extracted for each serotonergic agent, and relevant PK/PD indexes were calculated to assess correlation with mean number of DDIs (PV index). RESULTS Six hundred sixty-nine reports of SS mentioning linezolid were found, being linezolid-citalopram (N = 69; 10.3%) the most frequently DDI reported. Citalopram and methadone showed respectively the highest proportion of SS reports (0.28%) and the lowest mean number of DDIs (1.41). Citalopram, escitalopram, and methadone emerged as red (i.e., alert)-zone medications: they exhibited high lipophilicity and large VD (proxies of excellent central nervous system penetration) coupled with high potency. Among PK/PD indexes, a significant correlation with PV index was found for VD/Ki SERT ratio (p = 0.05). DISCUSSION Our integrated approach suggests that linezolid is more likely to cause SS when co-administered with citalopram, escitalopram, and methadone, as inferred from their pharmacological properties.

Research design and methods: We searched EuroPMC, PrePubMed bioRxiv and MedRxiv for preprints submitted by authors affiliated with the top 50 pharmaceutical companies from inception till June 15, 2020. Data were extracted and analyzed from the search results. The number of citations for the preprint and peer-reviewed versions (if available) were compiled using the Publish or Perish software (version 1.7). Altmetric score was calculated using the ""Altmetric it"" online tool. Statistical significance was analyzed by Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Results: A total of 498 preprints were identified across bioRxiv (83%), PeerJ (5%), F1000Research (6%), Nature Proceedings (3%), Preprint.org (3%), Wellcome Open Research preprint (0.2%) and MedRxiv (0.2%) servers. Roche, Sanofi and Novartis contributed 56% of the retrieved preprints. The median number of citations for the included preprints was 0 (IQR =1, Min-Max =0-45). The median number of citations for the published preprints and unpublished preprints was 0 for both (IQR =1, Min-Max =0-25 and IQR =1, Min-Max =0-45, respectively; P = .091). The median Altmetric score of the preprints was 4 (IQR =10.5, Min-Max =0-160). Conclusion: Pharma-authored research is being increasingly published as preprints and is also being cited in other peer-reviewed publications and discussed in social media.","Subramanian, Kaushik; Nalli, Anuradha; Vinitha, Senthil; Bhat, Amit",Current medical research and opinion,https://doi.org/10.1080/03007995.2020.1853083; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33206000/,273

94491,Sociology of Chronic Pain.,2021-07-20,"OBJECTIVE To comprehensively analyze the relative effectiveness of Raman spectroscopy (RS) in the diagnosis of suspected kidney cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS We performed a complete systematic review based on studies from PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, Ovid, Web of Knowledge, Cochrane Library and China National Knowledge Infrastructure. We identified 2413 spectra with strict criteria in 6 individual studies published between January 2008 and November 2018 in accordance to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. We summarized the test performance using random effects models. RESULTS General pooled diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of RS to kidney cancer were 0.96 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.95-0.97) and 0.91 (95% CI 0.89-0.92). The pooled positive likelihood ratio (LR) was 9.57 (95% CI 5.73-15.46) while the negative LR was 0.04 (95% CI 0.02-0.11). The pooled diagnostic odds ratio was 238.06 (95% CI 77.79-728.54). The area under curve of summary receiver operator characteristics was 0.9466. CONCLUSION Through this meta-analysis, we found a promisingly high sensitivity and specificity of RS in the diagnosis of suspected kidney masses and tumors. Other parameters like positive LR, negative LR, diagnostic odds ratio and area under curve of the summary receiver operator characteristics curve all helped to illustrate the high efficacy of RS in the diagnosis of kidney cancer.","Jin, Hongyu; He, Xiao; Zhou, Hui; Zhang, Man; Tang, Qingqing; Lin, Lede; Hao, Jianqi; Zeng, Rui",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000020933; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32629694/,273

95153,Understanding Perceived Appreciation to Create a Culture of Wellness.,2021-05-27,"Tau is a microtubule-associated protein that becomes dysregulated in a group of neurodegenerative diseases called tauopathies. Differential tau isoforms, expression levels, promoters, and disruption of endogenous genes in transgenic mouse models of tauopathy make it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the biological role of tau in these models. We addressed this shortcoming by characterizing the molecular and cognitive phenotypes associated with the pathogenic P301L tau mutation (rT2 mice) in relation to a genetically matched transgenic mouse overexpressing non-mutant (NM) 4-repeat (4R) human tau (rT1 mice). Both male and female mice were included in this study. Unexpectedly, we found that 4R NM human tau (hTau) exhibited abnormal dynamics in young mice that were lost with the P301L mutation, including elevated protein stability and hyperphosphorylation, which were associated with cognitive impairment in 5-month old rT1 mice. Hyperphosphorylation of NM hTau was observed as early as 4 weeks of age, and transgene suppression for the first 4 or 12 weeks of life prevented abnormal molecular and cognitive phenotypes in rT1, demonstrating that NM hTau pathogenicity is specific to postnatal development. We also show that NM hTau exhibits stronger binding to microtubules than P301L hTau, and is associated with mitochondrial abnormalities. Overall, our genetically matched mice have revealed that 4R NM hTau over expression is pathogenic in a manner distinct from classical aging-related tauopathy, underlining the importance of assaying the effects of transgenic disease-related proteins at appropriate stages in life.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTDue to differences in creation of transgenic lines, the pathological properties the P301L mutation confers to the tau protein in vivo have remained elusive, perhaps contributing to the lack of disease-modifying therapies for tauopathies. In an attempt to characterize P301L-specific effects on tau biology and cognition in novel genetically-matched transgenic mouse models, we surprisingly found that non-mutant (NM) human tau has development-specific pathogenic properties of its own. Our findings indicate that overexpression of 4-repeat human tau during postnatal development is associated with excessive microtubule-binding, which may disrupt important cellular processes such as mitochondrial dynamics, leading to elevated stability and hyperphosphorylation of tau, and eventual cognitive impairments.","Gamache, Julia E; Kemper, Lisa; Steuer, Elizabeth; Leinonen-Wright, Kailee; Choquette, Jessica M; Hlynialuk, Chris; Benzow, Kellie; Vossel, Keith A; Xia, Weiming; Koob, Michael D; Ashe, Karen H",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.1256-19.2019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31685653/,273
95183,Maintaining Safety Standards While Building an Urban Alternate Care Facility in a Global Pandemic.,2020-12-01,"The encephalitis lethargica (EL) epidemic swept the world between 1916 and 1926 and is estimated to have afflicted between 80,000 to one million people worldwide. EL is an unusual neurological illness that causes profound sleep disorders, devastating neurological sequalae and, in many cases, death. Though uncommon, EL is still occasionally diagnosed today when a patient presents with an acute or subacute encephalitic illness, where all other known causes of encephalitis have been excluded and criteria for EL are met. However, it is impossible to know whether recent cases of EL-like syndromes result from the same disease that caused the epidemic. After more than 100 years of research into potential pathogen triggers and the role of autoimmune processes, the aetiology of EL remains unknown. The epidemic approximately coincided with the 1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic but the evidence of a causal link is inconclusive. This article reviews the literature on the causes of EL with a focus on autoimmune mechanisms. In light of the current pandemic, we also consider the parallels between the EL epidemic and neurological manifestations of COVID-19. Understanding how pathogens and autoimmune processes can affect the brain may well help us understand the conundrum of EL and, more importantly, will guide the treatment of patients with suspected COVID-19-related neurological disease, as well as prepare us for any future epidemic of a neurological illness.","Bond, Molly; Bechter, Karl; Müller, Norbert; van Elst, Ludger Trebatz; Meier, Ute-Christiane",Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2021.110276; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33549696/,273
96129,Supporting people leaving prisons during COVID-19: perspectives from peer health mentors.,2021-02-17,"BACKGROUND Olfactory dysfunction (OD) is common and has been reported as an early indicator of COVID-19. However, the reported prevalence of OD in the general population varies widely depending upon the metric used to assess olfaction.Methodology/Principal: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the prevalence of OD in the healthy general population, review the various assessment metrics used, and compare pooled OD prevalence rates. RESULTS A total of 175,073 subjects were identified (mean age 63.5 years, range 18 to 101) with an overall OD prevalence of 22.2% (95% CI 14.8-30.6). OD prevalence was significantly greater using objective olfactory assessments, compared to subjective measures (28.8%, CI 20.3-38.2 versus 9.5%, CI 6.1-13.5, p < 0.001). The prevalence of OD was greater using expanded identification tests (>8 items) compared to brief test with ≤8 items (30.3%, CI 16.2-46.5 versus 21.2%, CI 12.3-31.8). Prevalence was higher in studies with a mean age greater than 55 years compared to those with a mean age of 55 years or less (34.5%, CI 23.4-46.5 versus 7.5%, CI 2.6-14.5, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The reported prevalence of OD in the general population depends on the testing method and population age. OD prevalence was greater in studies using objective tests, expanded identification tests, and in those with older subjects.","Desiato, Vincent M; Levy, Dylan A; Byun, Young Jae; Nguyen, Shaun A; Soler, Zachary M; Schlosser, Rodney J",American journal of rhinology & allergy,https://doi.org/10.1177/1945892420946254; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32746612/,273

We evaluated 679 patients with stable CAD enrolled in the Excellence in Peripheral Arterial Disease and Veterans Affairs North Texas Healthcare System peripheral arterial disease databases. ABI and 12-month major adverse CV events (MACEs, a composite of all-cause death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, need for repeat coronary revascularization, and ischemic stroke) were assessed. Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess the association of ABI and DM with subsequent CV events. An abnormal ABI (<0.9 or >1.4) was present in 72% of patients with stable CAD and 68% had DM. Using patients without DM and normal ABI as reference, the adjusted hazard ratio for 12-month MACE was 1.7 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.71 to 4.06) for patients with DM and normal ABI; 2.03 (95% CI 0.83 to 4.9) for patients without DM with abnormal ABI; and 4.85 (95% CI 2.22 to 10.61) for patients with DM and abnormal ABI. In conclusion, in patients with stable CAD, an abnormal ABI confers an incremental risk of MACE in addition to DM and traditional CV risk factors.","Banerjee, Subhash; Vinas, Ariel; Mohammad, Atif; Hadidi, Omar; Thomas, Rahul; Sarode, Karan; Banerjee, Avantika; Garg, Puja; Weideman, Rick A; Little, Bertis B; Brilakis, Emmanouil S",The American journal of cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjcard.2014.01.403; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24602299/,273
98005,"A model for treating COVID-19-related guilt, shame, and moral injury.",2020-06-18,"OBJECTIVE Renal scintigraphy represents the current diagnostic standard to assess split kidney function. We tested the hypothesis that the relative renal volume assessed by ultrasound provides an equally reliable but less invasive tool for assessment of kidney function as compared to renal scintigraphy in patients with primary vesicoureteral reflux. METHODS Renal ultrasound and renal scintigraphy were performed in 85 patients (median age 4.5 years, range 0.25-7.7) and repeated in 74 patients after 2-13 months (mean 7) of the primary investigation. Renal size was measured by ultrasound, and relative renal volume was calculated for each kidney by using the formula of a prolate ellipsoid. Renal function was estimated for each side (split renal function) by scintigraphy with (99m)Tc MAG3. RESULTS The mean difference between relative renal volume measured by ultrasound and split renal function determined by renal scintigraphy was 2.8% (standard deviation ± 4.1%; 95% confidence interval 10.8/-5.2%). There was a statistically significant correlation between relative renal volume estimated by ultrasound and split renal function estimated by renal scintigraphy at first examination (r = 0.98; p < 0.001) and at follow-up (r = 0.91; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION We conclude that ultrasound measurement of relative renal volume is capable of assessing split renal function in children with primary vesicoureteral reflux and, thus, should be considered instead of the more invasive MAG3 scintigraphy.","Weitz, Marcus; Licht, Christoph; Müller, Mark; Haber, Peter",Journal of pediatric urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpurol.2013.03.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23639632/,273
98654,Decommissioning and recommissioning a regional hospital in response to a COVID-19 outbreak.,2021-04-01,"BACKGROUND eHealth is developing rapidly and brings with it a promise to reduce social health inequalities (SHIs). Yet, it appears that it also has the potential to increase them. OBJECTIVES The general objective of this review was to set out how to ensure that eHealth contributes to reducing SHIs rather than exacerbating them. This review has three objectives: (1) identifying characteristics of people at risk of experiencing social inequality in health; (2) determining the possibilities of developing eHealth tools that avoid increasing SHI; and (3) modeling the process of using an eHealth tool by people vulnerable to SHI. METHODS Following the EPPI approach (Evidence for Policy and Practice of Information of the Institute of Education at the University of London), two databases were searched for the terms SHIs and eHealth and their derivatives in titles and abstracts. Qualitative, quantitative, and mixed articles were included and evaluated. The software NVivo (QSR International) was employed to extract the data and allow for a metasynthesis of the data. RESULTS Of the 73 articles retained, 10 were theoretical, 7 were from reviews, and 56 were based on empirical studies. Of the latter, 40 used a quantitative approach, 8 used a qualitative approach, 4 used mixed methods approach, and only 4 were based on participatory research-action approach. The digital divide in eHealth is a serious barrier and contributes greatly to SHI. Ethnicity and low income are the most commonly used characteristics to identify people at risk of SHI. The most promising actions for reducing SHI via eHealth are to aim for universal access to the tool of eHealth, become aware of users' literacy level, create eHealth tools that respect the cultural attributes of future users, and encourage the participation of people at risk of SHI. CONCLUSIONS eHealth has the potential to widen the gulf between those at risk of SHI and the rest of the population. The widespread expansion of eHealth technologies calls for rigorous consideration of interventions, which are not likely to exacerbate SHI.","Latulippe, Karine; Hamel, Christine; Giroux, Dominique",Journal of medical Internet research,https://doi.org/10.2196/jmir.6731; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28450271/,273
98994,From Economic Recovery to Health Resilience.,2021-02-23,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Stent retriever-assisted thrombectomy promotes high recanalization rates in acute ischemic stroke. Nevertheless, complications and failures occur in more than 10% of procedures; hence, there is a need for further investigation. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 144 patients with ischemic stroke presenting with large-vessel occlusion were prospectively included. Patients were treated with stent retriever-assisted thrombectomy ± IV fibrinolysis. Baseline clinical and imaging characteristics were incorporated in univariate and multivariate analyses. Predictors of recanalization failure (TICI 0, 1, 2a), and of embolic and hemorrhagic complications were reported. The relationship between complication occurrence and periprocedural mortality rate was studied. RESULTS Median age was 69.5 years, and median NIHSS score was 18 at presentation. Fifty patients (34.7%) received stand-alone thrombectomy, and 94 (65.3%) received combined therapy. The procedural failure rate was 13.9%. Embolic complications were recorded in 12.5% and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage in 7.6%. The overall rate of failure, complications, and/or death was 39.6%. The perioperative mortality rate was 18.4% in the overall cohort but was higher in cases of failure (45%; P = .003), embolic complications (38.9%; P = .0176), symptomatic intracranial hemorrhages (45.5%; P = .0236), and intracranial stenosis (50%; P = .0176). Concomitant fibrinolytic therapy did not influence the rate of recanalization or embolic complication, or the intracranial hemorrhage rate. Age was the only significant predictive factor of intracranial hemorrhage (P = .043). CONCLUSIONS The rate of perioperative mortality was significantly increased in cases of embolic and hemorrhagic complications, as well as in cases of failure and underlying intracranial stenoses. Adjunctive fibrinolytic therapy did not improve the recanalization rate or collateral embolic complication rate. The rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was not increased in cases of combined treatment.","Gascou, G; Lobotesis, K; Machi, P; Maldonado, I; Vendrell, J F; Riquelme, C; Eker, O; Mercier, G; Mourand, I; Arquizan, C; Bonafé, A; Costalat, V",AJNR.

99069,Lessons from the influx of preprints during the early COVID-19 pandemic.,2021-03-01,"BACKGROUND Primary care doctors put diagnostic codes on all reimbursement cards. The objective of this study was to map out the use of non-specific diagnostic codes that can undermine the validity of statistics and disease surveillance. MATERIAL AND METHOD The material consists of data from all electronic reimbursement cards from out-of-hours services in the period 2008-2019. We registered consultations and telephone contacts and the proportion of these that were supplied with diagnostic codes for respiratory infections and three non-specific diagnostic codes. RESULTS The number of consultations per year increased from 1 402 452 in 2008 to 1 417 395 in 2019, a relative increase of 1 %. The number of telephone contacts per year increased from 286 515 in 2008 to 684 773 in 2019, a relative increase of 139 %. Out-of-hours contacts coded with non-specific diagnoses increased nearly thirteenfold, from 40 280 to 514 715. The use of non-specific diagnoses increased by a factor of 19 for telephone contacts and 2.7 for consultations. The total number of out-of-hours contacts for respiratory infections decreased from 240 037 to 176 909 (a 26 % reduction). INTERPRETATION There is a strong tendency for general, non-specific diagnostic codes to replace specific diagnoses of disease on reimbursement cards from out-of-hours services. This undermines the evidence base for statistics and research based on reported ICPC-2 diagnoses, and this is especially of concern when these diagnoses are to be used for monitoring of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sandvik, Hogne; Hunskår, Steinar","Tidsskrift for den Norske laegeforening : tidsskrift for praktisk medicin, ny raekke",https://doi.org/10.4045/tidsskr.20.0266; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32815351/,273

A widely available, reliable, label-free, and rapid test that can recognize tiny amounts of specific biomarkers might be the solution. Nanobiosensors are one of the most attractive candidates for this purpose. Integration of graphene with biosensing devices shifts the performance of these systems to an incomparable level. Between the various arrangements using this wonder material, field-effect transistors (FETs) display a precise detection even in complex samples. The emergence of pioneering biosensors for detecting a wide range of diseases especially COVID-19 created the incentive to prepare a review of the recent graphene-FET biosensing platforms. However, the graphene fabrication and transfer to the surface of the device is an imperative factor for researchers to take into account. Therefore, we also reviewed the common methods of manufacturing graphene for biosensing applications and discuss their advantages and disadvantages.

102003,Hospital capacity during the COVID-19 pandemic.,2021-04-30,"The ""hybrid"" approach to chronic total occlusion (CTO) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was developed to provide guidance on optimal crossing strategy selection. Dual angiography remains the cornerstone of clinical decision making in CTO PCI. Four angiographic parameters are assessed: (a) morphology of the proximal cap (clear-cut or ambiguous); (b) occlusion length; (c) distal vessel size and presence of bifurcations beyond the distal cap; and (d) location and suitability of location and suitability of a retrograde conduit (collateral channels or bypass grafts) for retrograde access. Antegrade wire escalation is favored for short (<20 mm) occlusions, usually escalating rapidly from a soft tapered-tip polymer-jacketed guidewire to a stiff polymer-jacketed or tapered-tip guidewire. Antegrade dissection/re-entry is favored in long (≥20 mm long) occlusions, trying to minimize the dissection length by re-entering into the distal true lumen immediately after the occlusion. Primary retrograde approach is preferred for lesions with an ambiguous proximal cap, poor distal target, good interventional collaterals, and heavy calcification,as well as chronic kidney disease. The ""hybrid"" approach advocates early change between strategies to enable CTO crossing in the most efficacious, efficient, and safe way.

103996,Moral distress in medicine: An ethical analysis.,2021-05-02,"RATIONALE Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a highly contagious pathogen with a huge global health impact. It is a major cause of hospital-acquired infection; a large number of those exposed develop infection. Those infected in hospital are at increased risk of a severe clinical course. Prevention of nosocomial spread currently focuses on spread by hand and large droplets. There is little research evidence to determine if aerosol spread of infectious RSV is possible. OBJECTIVES To determine if the air surrounding infants with RSV-positive bronchiolitis contains RSV in aerosolized particles that remain capable of causing infection. METHODS The amount of RSV contained in aerosolized particles produced by infants with bronchiolitis due to RSV was measured using viable impactor sampling. The ability of RSV contained in these particles to infect healthy and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) human ciliated respiratory epithelium was determined. RESULTS We showed for the first time that infants with RSV-positive bronchiolitis nursed in a ward setting or ventilated in intensive care produced large numbers of aerosol particles containing RSV that remained infectious and were capable of infecting healthy and COPD human ciliated epithelium. A significant amount of RSV was found in particles with aerodynamic diameters less than 5 μm. CONCLUSIONS Many of the aerosolized particles that contained RSV in the air surrounding infants with bronchiolitis were sufficiently small to remain airborne for a significant length of time and small enough to be inhaled and deposited throughout the respiratory tract. It is likely that this leads to spread of infection to others, with dissemination of infection throughout the respiratory tract.","Kulkarni, Hemant; Smith, Claire Mary; Lee, Dani Do Hyang; Hirst, Robert Anthony; Easton, Andrew J; O'Callaghan, Chris",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.201509-1833oc; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26890617/,273

Application of the da Vinci S or Si robotic platforms could potentially overcome these challenges. OBJECTIVE Compare our initial experience with robotic assisted laparoendoscopic single-site (R-LESS) pyeloplasty to our latter experience with C-LESS pyeloplasty (ie, after the initial 15 patients). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This single-institution retrospective observational cohort study involved consecutive patients who presented with symptomatic ureteropelvic junction obstruction and who were deemed suitable for single-incision pyeloplasty by the treating surgeon. MEASUREMENTS Demographic, clinical, perioperative, and early postoperative comparative outcomes. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS Ten patients each underwent R-LESS or C-LESS pyeloplasty by a single surgeon between March 2009 and July 2011. For R-LESS and C-LESS groups, age, gender distribution, body mass index, proportion of patients with prior abdominal surgery, estimated blood loss, and hospital length of stay were statistically similar. Mean operative time was significantly longer for R-LESS (226 vs 188 min; p=0.007). C-LESS pyeloplasty alone required an accessory port for the anastomosis in 10 of 10 cases. Two conversions to standard laparoscopy and two postoperative complications occurred in 3 of 10 patients in the C-LESS group, compared with no conversions and one postoperative complication in the R-LESS group (p=0.26). Study limitations are a retrospective design, a modest number of patients, and a lack of quantification of subjective outcomes such as instrument clashing and maneuverability. CONCLUSIONS Adaptation of the da Vinci Si robotic surgical platform to laparoendoscopic single-site pyeloplasty appears to reduce the physical learning curve for this complex procedure. Future prospective, comprehensive evaluation of additional outcomes including subjective parameters, cosmesis, and longer term functional outcomes will help better define its role in minimally invasive dismembered pyeloplasty and better estimate its associated learning curve.","Olweny, Ephrem O; Park, Samuel K; Tan, Yung K; Gurbuz, Cenk; Cadeddu, Jeffrey A; Best, Sara L",European urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2011.10.024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22036645/,273
104760,Impact of lockdown following COVID-19 on the gaming behavior of college students.,2020-06-01,"Sequential diving by wild marine mammals results in a lifetime of rapid physiological transitions between lung collapse-reinflation, bradycardia-tachycardia, vasoconstriction-vasodilation, and oxygen store depletion-restoration. The result is a cycle of normoxia and hypoxia in which blood oxygen partial pressures can decline to <20-30 mmHg during a dive, a level considered injurious to oxygen-dependent human tissues (i.e., brain, heart). Safeguards in the form of enhanced on-board oxygen stores, selective oxygen transport, and unique tissue buffering capacities enable marine-adapted mammals to maintain physiological homeostasis and energy metabolism even when breathing and pulmonary gas exchange cease. This stands in stark contrast to the vulnerability of oxygen-sensitive tissues in humans that may undergo irreversible damage within minutes of ischemia and tissue hypoxia. Recently, these differences in protection against hypoxic injury have become evident in the systemic, multi-organ physiological failure during COVID-19 infection in humans. Prolonged recoveries in some patients have led to delays in the return to normal exercise levels and cognitive function even months later. Rather than a single solution to this problem, we find that marine mammals rely on a unique, integrative assemblage of protections to avoid the deleterious impacts of hypoxia on tissues. Built across evolutionary time, these solutions provide a natural template for identifying the potential for tissue damage when oxygen is lacking, and for guiding management decisions to support oxygen-deprived tissues in other mammalian species, including humans, challenged by hypoxia.","Williams, Terrie M; Davis, Randall W","Comparative biochemistry and physiology.

104770,"COVID-19 can suddenly become severe: a case series from Tokyo, Japan.",2020-06-30,"PURPOSE To compare 3D postoperative deformity correction using two distinct commonly utilized techniques for the treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). METHODS AIS patients with major thoracic (Lenke 1-2) curves at two sites who underwent deformity correction via posterior spinal instrumented fusion using one of two distinct techniques were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were matched 1:1 between sites for Lenke type (95% Lenke 1) and follow-up time. The ""band site"" performed posteromedial translation using thoracic sublaminar bands and 5.5-mm rods. The ""screw site"" performed spine derotation using differential rod contouring with pedicle screws and 5.5-mm rods. 3D measures of deformity from spinal reconstructions were compared between sites. RESULTS Preoperatively, the groups had similar thoracic curve magnitudes (band, 55 ± 12° vs. screw, 52 ± 10°; p > 0.05); the ""screw site"" had less T5-T12 kyphosis (2 ± 14° vs. 7 ± 12°, p = 0.05) and greater thoracic apical rotation (- 19 ± 7° vs. - 14 ± 8°, p = 0.007). Postoperatively, the ""screw site"" had greater percent correction (61% vs. 76%, p < 0.001) and kyphosis restoration (p = 0.002). The groups achieved a similar amount of apical derotation (p = 0.9). The ""band site"" used cobalt chromium rods exclusively; the ""screw site"" used cobalt chromium (3%) and stainless steel (97%; p < 0.001). The ""band site"" performed significantly longer fusions. CONCLUSIONS Significant variations were found between two commonly utilized techniques in AIS surgery, including rod material, correction mechanisms, and fusion levels. Significantly, a greater 3D deformity correction of the coronal and sagittal planes was observed at the ""screw site"" compared to the ""band site"", but with no difference in axial plane correction.","Sikora-Klak, Jakub; Upasani, Vidyadhar V; Ilharreborde, Brice; Cross, Madeline; Bastrom, Tracey P; Mazda, Keyvan; Yaszay, Burt; Newton, Peter O",Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00381-020-04868-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839853/,273

It is essential for both the clinicians and pathologists to maintain up-to-date knowledge of this continuously evolving topic in the midst of the current pandemic. Besides, understanding the impact of any disease in tissue pathology is crucial for better analysis of the pathogenesis and speculation of potential therapeutic targets. This review aimed to highlight the potential implication of COVID-19 in the pathology of various organ systems. We discuss the pathologic findings of the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, liver, brain, kidneys, heart, and the reproductive and immune systems that are associated with COVID-19. It seems that the respiratory, immune, and the digestive systems are the major targets of the disease. Mild mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltration is the most frequent histologic finding in general. Besides organ-specific changes, microthrombi, especially noticed in lungs, kidneys, and prostates, are the most significant observation microscopically. In addition, the possible mechanisms of organ injury were also reviewed.","Al Nemer, Areej",Advances in anatomic pathology,https://doi.org/10.1097/pap.0000000000000276; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32732586/,273
107699,Reentry Reflections: Views on COVID-19 From a Global Health Trainee.,2020-08-28,"Currently, there is no agreed naming system for isolates of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), whose host is the domestic fowl (Gallus gallus domesticus). A uniform, informative system for naming IBV isolates would be very helpful. Furthermore, the desirability of a single naming system has become more important with the recent discoveries that coronaviruses with genome organizations and gene sequences very similar to those of IBV have been isolated from turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) and pheasants (Phasianus colchicus). To date, no genetic features have been found that are unique to turkey isolates and to pheasant isolates that would permit unequivocal differentiation from IBVs. Should the avian coronaviruses from turkeys, pheasants and other birds each be considered as distinct coronavirus species? Or should avian coronaviruses that have gene sequences similar to those of IBV be treated as host-range variants of IBV or, more objectively, as host-range variants of a species that might be called avian coronavirus (ACoV)? Clearly, the topic of avian coronavirus species differentiation requires debate. For the moment, a naming system for avian coronavirus isolates is overdue. Increasingly, papers will include data of coronaviruses isolated from more than one species of bird. It is desirable to have a nomenclature for avian coronaviruses that indicates the host species of origin. Furthermore, it would be helpful if the name of an isolate included the country/region of origin, an isolate number and the year of isolation. The names of avian paramyxovirus (APMV) and avian influenza virus (AIV) isolates have long since contained this information; I suggest that we adopt a similar convention for isolates of avian coronaviruses. For example, the D274 isolate of IBV could be named chicken/Netherlands/D274/78. Representatives of avian coronaviruses from turkey and pheasant would include turkey/United States(Nc)/NC95/95 and pheasant/UK/750/83. Two upper case letters would be used to denote country of isolation, whereas one upper and one lower case letter would be used to indicate state or province, e.g. Nc, North Carolina. The full-length names could be abbreviated, when desired, similar to the convention used for AIV isolates, e.g. chNL78, tyUS(Nc)95 and phUK83. If the serotype of an isolate has been clearly established, this might be included in the name at end, like the serotype designation of AIVs, e.g. chicken/China/NRZ/91 (Mass.) for the Chinese isolate of the Massachusetts serotype. This suggested naming system for isolates is essentially neutral with regard to whether viruses from different bird species should be considered as different coronavirus species or simply as variants of just one avian coronavirus species. In my opinion an informative nomenclature for avian coronavirus isolates is required now, to improve communication, and need not be delayed until a decision on the definition of coronavirus species has been made.","Cavanagh, D",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,https://doi.org/10.1080/03079450120044506; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19184884/,273

Responsible for severe pneumonitis (Covid-19), there are also doubts concerning a possible mother-to-fetal transmission of this virus. Current data are patchy and obtained from small groups of patients. They tend to support the idea that the mother-to-fetal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is very rare, but the period between infection and childbirth was often very short and may not allow sufficient replication to consider transplacental passage. Here, we reviewed the existing virological data and those remaining to explore. Thus, the natural history of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women and the risk of transmission in utero is not yet fully understood and defined. Four months from the emergence of this virus, it is therefore reasonable to wait for the results of specific studies on larger cohorts which, to be conclusive, must meet the best scientific criteria.","Egloff, Chales; Picone, Olivier; Vauloup-Fellous, Christelle; Roques, Pierre",Virologie,https://doi.org/10.1684/vir.2020.0838; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32648549/,273

COVID-19 is caused by a novel corona virus, referred to as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), resulting in pandemic conditions around the globe. We are in the battleground to fight against the virus in rapidly developing therapeutic strategies in tackling SARS-CoV-2 and save human lives from COVID-19. Scientists are evaluating several known drugs either for the pathogen or the host, however, many of them are reported to be associate with side effects. In the present study, we report the molecular binding mechanisms of the natural alkaloid, noscapine for repurposing against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2, key enzyme involved in its reproduction. We performed the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation in an explicit solvent to investigate the molecular mechanisms of noscapine for stable binding and conformational changes to the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2. The drug repurposing study revealed the high potential of noscapine and proximal binding to the Mpro enzyme in a comparative binding pattern analysed with chloroquine, ribavirin, and favipiravir. Noscapine binds closely to binding pocket-3 of Mpro enzyme and depicted stable binding with RMSD 0.1-1.9 Å and RMSF profile peak conformational fluctuations at 202-306 residues and Rg score ranging from 21.9 Å- 22.4 Å. The MM/PB (GB) SA calculation landscape revealed the most significant contribution in terms of binding energy with deltaPB -19.08 and deltaGB -27.17 kcal/mol. The electrostatic energy distribution in MM energy was obtained to -71.16 kcal/mol and depicted high free energy decomposition (electrostatic energy) at 155-306 residues (Binding pocket-3) of Mpro by MM force field. Moreover, the dynamical residue cross-correlation map also stated the high pairwise correlation occurred at binding residues 200-306 of the Mpro enzyme (binding pocket-3) with noscapine. Principal component analysis depicted the enhanced movement of protein atoms with a high number of static hydrogen bonds. Obtained binding results of noscapine were also well correlated with pharmacokinetic parameters of antiviral drugs.","Kumar, Neeraj; Sood, Damini; van der Spek, Peter J; Sharma, Hari S; Chandra, Ramesh",Journal of proteome research,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00367; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32786685/,273

The initial case reports show the safety and feasibility, but the learning curve for this technique is unknown. METHODS Between July 2009 and September 2010, 20 consecutive patients with an indication for right hemicolectomy underwent a single-port laparoscopic approach without bias in selection. The only exclusion criterion was a prior midline laparotomy. The patients were followed up for 30 days. Chart review was completed for up to 35 months to assess long-term morbidity and mortality rates. RESULTS The median age was 65 years (range, 59-88 years). Ninety percent of patients were men. The median body mass index was 28 kg/m(2) (range, 20-35 kg/m(2)). Seventy-five percent of patients had significant comorbidities with an American Society of Anesthesiologists class of 3 or 4. The estimated blood loss was 25 mL (range, 25-250 mL). The median number of pathologic lymph nodes for patients diagnosed with adenocarcinoma was 16 (range, 8-23). There was one conversion to hand-assisted laparoscopic (case 6) and one to open colectomy (case 9) because of the inability to achieve safe vessel ligation. The median hospital stay was 4.5 days (range, 3-7 days). The length of stay for the first 10 patients was 5.1 days, and it was 3.9 days for the last 10 patients (P = .045). There were no significant postoperative complications within 30 days. The mean operative time for the first 10 cases was 198 minutes (range, 148-272 minutes), and it was 123 minutes (range, 98-150 minutes) for the subsequent 10 cases (P = .0001). All intraoperative complications (minor bleeding) occurred within the first 10 patients, with no significant bleeding recorded for the last 10 cases. CONCLUSION Single-port laparoscopic right hemicolectomy can be safely performed in patients who are candidates for conventional or hand-assisted right hemicolectomy with very low intraoperative and postoperative complication rates. The 30-day morbidity rate remained low with this technique. The higher technical difficulty compared with conventional laparoscopy is reflected in the longer initial operative times. The learning curve for a surgeon with advanced laparoscopic skills and adequate procedure numbers seems to be short, requiring approximately 10 cases to decrease operative times to baseline. The role and feasibility of broad adaptation for single-incision laparoscopy in colorectal surgery need to be further evaluated in larger case series and trials.","Hopping, Jacob R; Bardakcioglu, Ovunc",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/108680813x13654754534558; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23925011/,273

Methods: Fifteen fresh goat heads (weighing 2.5-3.0 kg) were purchased from the market. They were all ordinary goats (9-12 months old, body weighing 18-21 kg) regardless of gender. Bilateral articular discs (a total of 30) were dissected within 30 minutes after execution. According to the national standard for mechanical testing of viscoelastic materials, fresh TMJ disc specimens of goat were prepared and tests were carried out in physiological conditions. The universal mechanical testing machine was utilized to test biomechanical properties of TMJ discs. Results: The compressive modulus of TMJ discs was (8.41±2.12) MPa and the tensile modulus was (9.54±3.26) MPa. The mechanical characteristics would be irreversibly altered once the load exceeded the physiological range. In addition, it underwent apparent creep relaxation under continuous strain (0.5 MPa or 3.0 MPa) and the surface friction coefficient of the TMJ discs (0.015+0.011) was much lower than that of general viscoelastic materials.

The design of these inhibitors is challenging as many properties, for example, inhibitor size and functionalization with virus attachment factors, strongly influence the inhibition efficiency. Here, virus binding inhibitors are synthesized, the size and functionalization of which are inspired by mucins, which are naturally occurring glycosylated proteins with high molecular weight (MDa range) and interact efficiently with various viruses. Hyperbranched polyglycerols (hPGs) with molecular weights ranging between 10 and 2600 kDa are synthesized, thereby hitting the size of mucins and allowing for determining the impact of inhibitor size on the inhibition efficiency. The hPGs are functionalized with sialic acids and sulfates, as suggested from the structure of mucins, and their inhibition efficiency is determined by probing the inhibition of influenza A virus (IAV) binding to membranes using various methods. The largest, mucin-sized inhibitor shows potent inhibition at pm concentrations, while the inhibition efficiency decreases with decreasing the molecular weight. Interestingly, the concentration-dependent IAV inhibition shows a biphasic behavior, which is attributed to differences in the binding affinity of the inhibitors to the two IAV envelope proteins, neuraminidase, and hemagglutinin.","Wallert, Matthias; Nie, Chuanxiong; Anilkumar, Parambath; Abbina, Srinivas; Bhatia, Sumati; Ludwig, Kai; Kizhakkedathu, Jayachandran N; Haag, Rainer; Block, Stephan",Small,https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202004635; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33135314/,273

RECENT FINDINGS Although the mainstay of neuropathic pain management is still represented by drug therapy, particularly antidepressants and antiepileptics, the place of nonpharmacological therapy including in particular brain neuromodulation techniques has substantially increased in recent years. Newer study designs are also increasingly implemented, based on in depth phenotypic profiling to achieve more individualized therapy, or on screening strategies to decrease placebo effect and contribute to increase assay sensitivity. These approaches are now considered the most promising to decrease therapeutic failures in neuropathic pain.

The reduction in international travel and domestic movement, social distancing measures and public health action have likely slowed the spread of the disease. Notifications in Australia remain predominantly among people with recent overseas travel, with some locally-acquired cases being detected. Most locally-acquired cases are able to be linked back to a confirmed case, with a small portion unable to be epidemiologically linked. The distribution of overseas-acquired cases to locally acquired cases varies by jurisdiction. Internationally, cases continue to increase. The rates of increase have started to slow in several regions, although it is too soon to tell whether this trend will be sustained.

The prognostic meaning of anaemia and polyglobulia on outcomes in patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis is ambiguous. Patients and methods In this prospective multicentre, intravenous thrombolysis register-based study, we compared haemoglobin levels on hospital admission with three-month poor outcome (modified Rankin Scale 3-6), mortality and symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study II-criteria (ECASS-II-criteria)). Haemoglobin level was used as continuous and categorical variable distinguishing anaemia (female: <12 g/dl; male: <13 g/dl) and polyglobulia (female: >15.5 g/dl; male: >17 g/dl). Anaemia was subdivided into mild and moderate/severe (female/male: <11 g/dl). Normal haemoglobin level (female: 12.0-15.5 g/dl, male: 13.0-17.0 g/dl) served as reference group. Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated with logistic regression models. Results Among 6866 intravenous thrombolysis-treated stroke patients, 5448 (79.3%) had normal haemoglobin level, 1232 (17.9%) anaemia - of those 903 (13.2%) had mild and 329 (4.8%) moderate/severe anaemia - and 186 (2.7%) polyglobulia. Anaemia was associated with poor outcome (ORadjusted 1.25 (1.05-1.48)) and mortality (ORadjusted 1.58 (1.27-1.95)). In anaemia subgroups, both mild and moderate/severe anaemia independently predicted poor outcome (ORadjusted 1.29 (1.07-1.55) and 1.48 (1.09-2.02)) and mortality (ORadjusted 1.45 (1.15-1.84) and ORadjusted 2.00 (1.46-2.75)). Each haemoglobin level decrease by 1 g/dl independently increased the risk of poor outcome (ORadjusted 1.07 (1.02-1.11)) and mortality (ORadjusted 1.08 (1.02-1.15)). Anaemia was not associated with occurrence of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage. Polyglobulia did not change any outcome. Discussion The more severe the anaemia, the higher the probability of poor outcome and death. Severe anaemia might be a target for interventions in hyperacute stroke. Conclusion Anaemia on admission, but not polyglobulia, is a strong and independent predictor of poor outcome and mortality in intravenous thrombolysis-treated stroke patients.","Altersberger, Valerian L; Kellert, Lars; Al Sultan, Abdulaziz S; Martinez-Majander, Nicolas; Hametner, Christian; Eskandari, Ashraf; Heldner, Mirjam R; van den Berg, Sophie A; Zini, Andrea; Padjen, Visnja; Kägi, Georg; Pezzini, Alessandro; Polymeris, Alexandros; DeMarchis, Gian M; Tiainen, Marjaana; Räty, Silja; Nannoni, Stefania; Jung, Simon; Zonneveld, Thomas P; Maffei, Stefania; Bonati, Leo; Lyrer, Philippe; Sibolt, Gerli; Ringleb, Peter A; Arnold, Marcel; Michel, Patrik; Curtze, Sami; Nederkoorn, Paul J; Engelter, Stefan T; Gensicke, Henrik",European stroke journal,https://doi.org/10.1177/2396987319889468; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32637647/,273

COVID-19 has created new strains on elite athletes, thus potentially increasing their vulnerability to mental health symptoms. This manuscript serves as a narrative review of the impact of the pandemic on management of those symptoms in elite athletes and ensuing recommendations to guide that management. It specifically addresses psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy and higher levels of care. Within the realm of psychotherapy, crisis counselling might be indicated. Individual, couple/family and group psychotherapy modalities all may be helpful during the pandemic, with novel content and means of delivery. Regarding pharmacotherapy for mental health symptoms and disorders, some important aspects of management have changed during the pandemic, particularly for certain classes of medication including stimulants, medications for bipolar and psychotic disorders, antidepressants and medications for substance use disorders. Providers must consider when in-person management (eg, for physical examination, laboratory testing) or higher levels of care (eg, for crisis stabilisation) is necessary, despite potential risk of viral exposure during the pandemic. Management ultimately should continue to follow general principles of quality health care with some flexibility. Finally, the current pandemic provides an important opportunity for research on new methods of providing mental health care for athletes, and consideration for whether these new methods should extend beyond the pandemic.","Reardon, Claudia L; Bindra, Abhinav; Blauwet, Cheri; Budgett, Richard; Campriani, Niccolo; Currie, Alan; Gouttebarge, Vincent; McDuff, David; Mountjoy, Margo; Purcell, Rosemary; Putukian, Margot; Rice, Simon; Hainline, Brian",British journal of sports medicine,https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2020-102884; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32967853/,273

120544,Work-Life Fit During A Pandemic.,2020-10-01,"BACKGROUND To assess whether the imposition of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) national quarantine (March 10, 2020) resulted in a shift in the proportion of patients operated for hip fracture on the day of admission, the following day and two days after admission in the region of Piedmont, northern Italy. METHODS Interrupted time-series analysis (ITSA) comparing hospitalization rate and timing of hip-fracture surgeries between pre- and post-quarantine period. The same data observed in Piedmont the year before were included as a control time series with no ""intervention"" (quarantine) in the middle of the observation period. RESULTS We found that 70.3% and 69.4% of hip-fracture patients received surgery within 2 days of hospital admission in the 16 weeks before and after the national quarantine, respectively. One-day surgery went from 46.0% to 46.5%, and same-day surgery from 13.3% to 12.4%. Unchanged trends were confirmed by ITSA after controlling for the 32-week time-series observed the year before. In the second week of March 2020, there was a borderline significant decrease in weekly hospital admissions for hip fractures as compared with that of the same week of March 2019 (-1.95 per 100 000, 95% CI = -4.10 to 0.21, P value = .075), followed by a weekly significant increase in the hospitalization rate (+0.14 per 100 000, 95% CI = 0.01 to 0.27, P value = .039), although the difference-in-differences of slopes failed to achieve statistical significance (0.19 per 100 000, 95% CI = -0.03 to 0.41, P value = .090). CONCLUSION Our study shows that the timing of hip-fracture surgery was unchanged during the lockdown period. This suggests that the healthcare systems can be resilient and able to guarantee a high-quality and safe healthcare to hip-fracture patients, even in the most challenging working conditions.","Lenzi, Jacopo; Rousset, Stefano; Fantini, Maria Pia; Gianino, Maria Michela",International journal of health policy and management,https://doi.org/10.34172/ijhpm.2021.103; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34523862/,273

125792,Running the Numbers : Estimated Changes in Health Insurance Coverage of North Carolinians in the First Six Months of the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020,"BACKGROUND Aseptic technique is a core nursing skill. Sound preparation is required during pre-registration nursing education to enable student nurses to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to prevent and control healthcare-associated infection and promote patient safety. Few studies have explored nursing students' education and training in aseptic technique. OBJECTIVES To investigate what, when and how pre-registration nursing students are taught aseptic technique and how they are assessed in undergraduate, pre-registration nursing programmes in the United Kingdom. DESIGN National cross-sectional survey exploring preparation to undertake aseptic technique in pre-registration nursing curricula in the United Kingdom. SETTING Universities providing undergraduate, pre-registration adult nursing programmes in the United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS Nurse educators. METHODS Structured telephone interviews were conducted with nurse educators. Descriptive and inferential statistical data analyses were undertaken. RESULTS Response rate was 70% (n = 49/70). A variety of different learning and teaching methods were reported to be in use. Teaching in relation to aseptic technique took place in conjunction with teaching in relation to different clinical procedures rather than placing emphasis on the principles of asepsis per se and how to transfer them to different procedures and situations. Wide variation in teaching time; use of multiple guidelines; inaccuracy in the principles identified by educators as taught to students; and limited opportunity for regular, criteria based competency assessment were apparent across programmes. CONCLUSIONS Pre-registration preparation in relation to aseptic technique requires improvement. There is a need to develop a working definition of aseptic technique. The generalisability of these findings in other healthcare students needs to be explored.","Hawker, Clare; Courtenay, Molly; Wigglesworth, Neil; Gould, Dinah",Nurse education today,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nedt.2020.104415; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408246/,273

Therefore, the majority of institutions that teach topographical anatomy rely on body donation programmes to provide specimens for both undergraduate and postgraduate teaching of gross anatomy. The COVID-19 pandemic has posed an unprecedented challenge to anatomy teaching because of the suspension of donor acceptance at most institutions. This was largely due to concerns about the potential transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the absence of data about the ability of embalming solutions to neutralise the virus. Twenty embalming solutions commonly used in institutions in the United Kingdom and Ireland were tested for their ability to neutralise SARS-CoV-2, using an established cytotoxicity assay. All embalming solutions tested neutralised SARS-CoV-2, with the majority of solutions being effective at high-working dilutions. These results suggest that successful embalming with the tested solutions can neutralise the SARS-CoV-2 virus, thereby facilitating the safe resumption of body donation programmes and cadaveric anatomy teaching.","Quondamatteo, Fabio; Corzo-Leon, Dora E; Brassett, Cecilia; Colquhoun, Ian; Davies, David C; Dockery, Peter; Grenham, Sue; Guild, Simon; Hunter, Amanda; Jones, James; Lee, Thomas C; Tracey, Chris; Wilkinson, Tracey; Munro, Carol A; Gillingwater, Thomas H; Parson, Simon H",Journal of anatomy,https://doi.org/10.1111/joa.13549; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34633083/,273

In humans, caliciviruses are a major cause of acute gastroenteritis, while in animals respiratory illness, conjunctivitis, stomatitis, and hemorrhagic disease are documented. Investigation of virus-host interactions is limited by a lack of culture systems for many viruses in this family. Feline calicivirus (FCV), a member of the Vesivirus genus, provides a tractable model, since it may be propagated in cell culture. Feline junctional adhesion molecule 1 (fJAM-1) was recently identified as a functional receptor for FCV. We have analyzed the structure of this virus-receptor complex by cryo-electron microscopy and three-dimensional image reconstruction, combined with fitting of homology modeled high-resolution coordinates. We show that domain 1 of fJAM-1 binds to the outer face of the P2 domain of the FCV capsid protein VP1, inducing conformational changes in the viral capsid. This study provides the first structural view of a native calicivirus-protein receptor complex and insights into the mechanisms of virus attachment and uncoating.","Bhella, David; Gatherer, Derek; Chaudhry, Yasmin; Pink, Rebecca; Goodfellow, Ian G",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00550-08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18550656/,273

METHODS 100 consecutive patients (19 women; mean age 71, range 37-90years) with critical limb ischemia (30%) or claudication, and TASC A-D lesions in iliac or common femoral arteries, were prospectively enrolled, from January 2013 to June 2015, to be treated via the TRA. Exclusion criteria included no palpable radial arteries (RA) and the presence of a fistula for hemodialysis. Patients were evaluated for procedural technical success, in-hospital complications, and 30days clinical success (defined as improvement of at least one grade in the Rutherford classification of symptoms). RESULTS A total of 131 iliac and common femoral arteries lesions were treated (58 in common iliac arteries, 38 in external iliac arteries and 35 in common femoral arteries). Ninety-two stents were deployed in 58 patients. Procedural technical success was achieved in 91% of the lesions; with 95% technical success rate in common iliac arteries, 87% in external iliac arteries and 89% in common femoral arteries; with 72% technical success rate in occlusions and 98% in stenosis. No in-hospital complications were observed.

Our aim was to evaluate the reliability of the individual items in the existing indices and develop new scoring systems by selection of the most reliable index items. Methods Two observers scored the histological slides [n = 224] and endoscopy videos [n = 201] from treated and untreated Interleukin[IL]-10 knock-out and T-cell transferred SCID mice. Intra-rater and inter-rater reliability for endoscopy and histology scores, and each individual item, were measured using intraclass correlation coefficients [ICCs]. The Mouse Colitis Histology Index [MCHI] and Mouse Colitis Endoscopy Index [MCEI] were developed using the most reliable items. Both were correlated to the colon density and to each other and were evaluated for their ability to detect changes in pathobiology. Results The intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for inter-rater agreement (95% CIs) for the total histology and endoscopy scores were 0.90 [0.87-0.92] and 0.80 [0.76-0.84], respectively. The MCHI and MCEI were highly correlated with colon density, with a Spearman Rho = 0.81[0.75-0.85] and 0.73 [0.66-0.79], respectively, and with each other, Spearman Rho = 0.71 [0.63-0.77]. The MCHI and MCEI were able to distinguish between the experimental groups within the models, with pairwise differences between the treated and untreated groups being statistically significant [p < 0.001].

HYPOTHESIS The DB-ACLR with a BPTB allograft is technically feasible and will be superior to the SB technique in restoring better anterior and rotating stability. STUDY DESIGN Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. METHODS The study was performed with 56 patients, and 52 (25 in the DB group and 27 in the SB group) of them were followed up at 2 to 5 years. With an irradiated deep-frozen BPTB allograft, a standard single-incision arthroscopic technique was used, and the graft was fixed with bioabsorbable interference screws on both the femoral and tibial sides. Outcome assessment at final follow-up included International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Tegner, and Lysholm scores; side-to-side difference by conventional KT-2000 arthrometer; total anteroposterior (AP) laxity by the back-pushing KT-2000 arthrometer; pivot shift (0, +, ++); range of motion (ROM); and isokinetic muscle strength evaluation. RESULTS Mean follow-up was 47.3 ± 11.5 and 58.2 ± 6.6 months for the DB group and SB group, respectively. A statistically significant difference in favor of the DB group was found with the total AP laxity at 30° (P < .05). The overall incidence of pivot shift in the DB group (4% ++) was significantly lower than that in the SB group (26%: 19% + and 7% ++; P = .029). No significant differences were found between the 2 groups in terms of IKDC score, Lysholm score, Tegner score, conventional KT-2000 arthrometer anterior laxity, ROM, and muscle strength. CONCLUSION A DB-ACLR with a BPTB allograft is feasible and achieved more satisfactory results than the transtibial SB technique in terms of total AP stability and rotational stability in spite of no significant differences among other clinical parameters.","Jiang, Dong; Ao, Ying-Fang; Gong, Xi; Wang, Yong-Jian; Luo, Hao; Chen, Lian-Xu; Wang, Hai-Jun; Xie, Xing; Zhang, Ji-Ying; Yu, Jia-Kuo",The American journal of sports medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546512440686; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22472270/,273

METHODS One hundred seven NOTES operations have been performed at our institution to date, of which 17 were completed in patients with body mass index (BMI) between 35 and 45 kg/m(2). These included 14 cholecystectomies, one appendectomy, and two ventral hernia repairs. The patients had average age of 36.2 years (range 19-62 years) and average BMI of 38.9 kg/m(2) (range 35.2-44.9 kg/m(2)). The mean number of previous abdominal operations was 1. The TV cholecystectomies were hybrid NOTES procedures, while TV appendectomy and ventral hernia repair were pure NOTES. All operations were completed with standard straight laparoscopic instruments. RESULTS The mean operative time was 60 min for cholecystectomy, 41 min for TV appendectomy, and 90 min for ventral hernia repair. No significant difference was encountered between the operative time for NOTES cholecystectomies in obese versus nonobese (60 vs. 61 min, p = 0.86). No conversions to traditional laparoscopy or open surgery were made, and no major complications were encountered.

133681,Please Scream Inside Your Heart: Compounded Loss and Coping during the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2021-02-14,"Background Ischaemic stroke may be a major complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection.Studying and characterising the different aetiological subtypes, clinical characteristics, and functional outcomes may be valuable in guiding patient selection for optimal management and treatment. Methods Data were collected retrospectively on consecutive patients with COVID-19 who developed acute focal brain ischaemia (between 1 March and 19 April 2020) at a tertiary university hospital in Madrid (Spain). Results During the study period, 1594 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. We found 22 patients with ischaemic stroke (1.38%), 6 of whom did not meet the inclusion criteria. The remaining 16 patients were included in the study (15 cases of ischaemic stroke and one case of transient ischaemic attack).Median baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 9 (interquartile range: 16), and mean (standard deviation) age was 73 years (12.8). Twelve patients (75%) were men. Mean time from COVID-19 symptom onset to stroke onset was 13 days. Large vessel occlusion was identified in 12 patients (75%).We detected elevated levels of D-dimer in 87.5% of patients and C-reactive protein in 81.2%. The main aetiology was atherothrombotic stroke (9 patients, 56.3%), with the predominant subtype being endoluminal thrombus (5 patients, 31.2%), involving the internal carotid artery in 4 cases and the aortic arch in one. The mortality rate in our series was 44% (7 of 16 patients). Conclusions In patients with COVID-19, the most frequent stroke aetiology was atherothrombosis, with a high proportion of endoluminal thrombus (31.2% of patients). Our clinical and laboratory data support COVID-19-associated coagulopathy as a relevant pathophysiological mechanism for ischaemic stroke in these patients.","Gómez-Porro, Pablo; Cabal-Paz, Borja; Valenzuela-Chamorro, Santiago; Desanvicente-Celis, Zayrho; Sabin-Muñoz, Julia; Ochoa-López, Carolina; Flórez, Camilo; Enríquez-Calzada, Silvia; Martín-García, Raquel; Esain-González, Íñigo; García-Fleitas, Bruno; Silva-Hernández, Lorenzo; Ruiz-Molina, Ángel; Gamo-González, Elisa; Durán-Lozano, Alejandro; Velasco-Calvo, Rocío; Alba-Alcántara, Lucía; González-Santiago, Raquel; Callejas-Díaz, Alejandro; Brea-Álvarez, Beatriz; Salazar-Uribe, Juan-Carlos; Escamilla-Crespo, Carlos; Carneado-Ruiz, Joaquín",Neurologia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nrl.2021.04.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33994626/,273

134623,Adherence to the Physical Distancing Measures during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A HAPA-Based Perspective.,2020-10-13,"BACKGROUND Human parainfluenza virus (hPIV) is a common virus in childhood acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI). However, no estimates have been made to quantify the global burden of hPIV in childhood ALRI. We aimed to estimate the global and regional hPIV-associated and hPIV-attributable ALRI incidence, hospital admissions, and mortality for children younger than 5 years and stratified by 0-5 months, 6-11 months, and 12-59 months of age. METHODS We did a systematic review of hPIV-associated ALRI burden studies published between Jan 1, 1995, and Dec 31, 2020, found in MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, Global Health Library, three Chinese databases, and Google search, and also identified a further 41 high-quality unpublished studies through an international research network. We included studies reporting community incidence of ALRI with laboratory-confirmed hPIV; hospital admission rates of ALRI or ALRI with hypoxaemia in children with laboratory-confirmed hPIV; proportions of patients with ALRI admitted to hospital with laboratory-confirmed hPIV; or in-hospital case-fatality ratios (hCFRs) of ALRI with laboratory-confirmed hPIV. We used a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to assess risk of bias. We analysed incidence, hospital admission rates, and hCFRs of hPIV-associated ALRI using a generalised linear mixed model. Adjustment was made to account for the non-detection of hPIV-4. We estimated hPIV-associated ALRI cases, hospital admissions, and in-hospital deaths using adjusted incidence, hospital admission rates, and hCFRs. We estimated the overall hPIV-associated ALRI mortality (both in-hospital and out-hospital mortality) on the basis of the number of in-hospital deaths and care-seeking for child pneumonia. We estimated hPIV-attributable ALRI burden by accounting for attributable fractions for hPIV in laboratory-confirmed hPIV cases and deaths. Sensitivity analyses were done to validate the estimates of overall hPIV-associated ALRI mortality and hPIV-attributable ALRI mortality. The systematic review protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42019148570). FINDINGS 203 studies were identified, including 162 hPIV-associated ALRI burden studies and a further 41 high-quality unpublished studies. Globally in 2018, an estimated 18·8 million (uncertainty range 12·8-28·9) ALRI cases, 725 000 (433 000-1 260 000) ALRI hospital admissions, and 34 400 (16 400-73 800) ALRI deaths were attributable to hPIVs among children younger than 5 years. The age-stratified and region-stratified analyses suggested that about 61% (35% for infants aged 0-5 months and 26% for 6-11 months) of the hospital admissions and 66% (42% for infants aged 0-5 months and 24% for 6-11 months) of the in-hospital deaths were in infants, and 70% of the in-hospital deaths were in low-income and lower-middle-income countries. Between 73% and 100% (varying by outcome) of the data had a low risk in study design; the proportion was 46-65% for the adjustment for health-care use, 59-77% for patient groups excluded, 54-93% for case definition, 42-93% for sampling strategy, and 67-77% for test methods. Heterogeneity in estimates was found between studies for each outcome. INTERPRETATION We report the first global burden estimates of hPIV-associated and hPIV-attributable ALRI in young children. Globally, approximately 13% of ALRI cases, 4-14% of ALRI hospital admissions, and 4% of childhood ALRI mortality were attributable to hPIV. These numbers indicate a potentially notable burden of hPIV in ALRI morbidity and mortality in young children. These estimates should encourage and inform investment to accelerate the development of targeted interventions.

136843,SuperNurse? Troubling the Hero Discourse in COVID Times.,2020-06-13,"The deadly disease-causing novel coronavirus has recently swept across the world and endangered many human lives. Although, various research on therapeutic measures to solve this pandemic crisis has been published; no favourable results have been achieved. We propose the use of potential FDA-approved dual inhibitors which can inhibit two targets (either on entry-level or the main protease) for the effective treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We screened 12 FDA-approved antiviral inhibitors listed in Drug bank and analysed the ADMET properties of each drug of interest to study the bioavailability, safety and toxicity. Two potential targets, the spike protein and the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 obtained from PDB have been used for molecular docking. All the selected drugs were docked with both targets and demonstrated strong hydrogen bond (HB) interactions in multiple active sites. Amongst these, the range of binding energy was from 3-7 kcal/mol for spike protein and 2-8 kcal/mol for the main protease. Upon comparison of all the processed drugs ganciclovir and zanamivir displayed significant binding energy with HB interactions with both, spike (-9.2 and -9 kcal/mol respectively) and the main protease (-9 kcal/mol). Ribavirin and tenofovir showed significant binding energy above -8 kcal/mol with seven HB interactions with the main protease and also spike protein. The novel findings regarding the antiviral properties of these dual inhibitors using a computational approach will be a good starting point for the efficacy determination of these drugs for pre-clinical and clinical studies aimed at developing active antivirals to target SARS-CoV-2.

137308,Funding Children's Health: COVID-19 And Beyond.,2020-10-01,"Over the last 10 years we have significantly reduced hospital mortality from sepsis and critical illness. However, the evidence reveals that over the same period we have tripled the number of patients being sent to rehabilitation settings. Further, given that as many as half of the deaths in the first year following ICU admission occur post ICU discharge, it is unclear how many of these patients ever returned home. For those who do survive, the latest data indicate that 50-70% of ICU ""survivors"" will suffer cognitive impairment and 60-80% of ""survivors"" will suffer functional impairment or ICU-acquired weakness (ICU-AW). These observations demand that we as intensive care providers ask the following questions: ""Are we creating survivors ... or are we creating victims?"" and ""Do we accomplish 'Pyrrhic Victories' in the ICU?"" Interventions to address ICU-AW must have a renewed focus on optimal nutrition, anabolic/anticatabolic strategies, and in the future employ the personalized muscle and exercise evaluation techniques utilized by elite athletes to optimize performance. Specifically, strategies must include optimal protein delivery (1.2-2.0 g/kg/day), as an athlete would routinely employ. However, as is clear in elite sports performance, optimal nutrition is fundamental but alone is often not enough. We know burn patients can remain catabolic for 2 years post burn; thus, anticatabolic agents (i.e., beta-blockers) and anabolic agents (i.e., oxandrolone) will probably also be essential. In the near future, evaluation techniques such as assessing lean body mass at the bedside using ultrasound to determine nutritional status and ultrasound-measured muscle glycogen as a marker of muscle injury and recovery could be utilized to help find the transition from the acute phase of critical illness to the recovery phase. Finally, exercise physiology testing that evaluates muscle substrate utilization during exercise can be used to diagnose muscle mitochondrial dysfunction and to guide a personalized ideal heart rate, assisting in recovery of muscle mitochondrial function and functional endurance post ICU. In the end, future ICU-AW research must focus on using a combination of modern performance-enhancing nutrition, anticatabolic/anabolic interventions, and muscle/exercise testing so we can begin to create more ""survivors"" and fewer victims post ICU care.","Wischmeyer, Paul E; San-Millan, Inigo",Critical care,https://doi.org/10.1186/cc14724; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26728966/,273

The mechanisms necessary for cells to repair plasma membrane defects have been extensively investigated in the last two decades, and some of these key repair mechanisms are also shown to occur following lung cell injury. Because it was theorized that lung wounding and repair are involved in the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), in this review, we summarized the experimental evidence of lung cell injury in these two devastating syndromes and discuss relevant genetic, physical, and biological injury mechanisms, as well as mechanisms used by lung cells for cell survival and membrane repair. Finally, we discuss relevant signaling pathways that may be activated by chronic or repeated lung cell injury as an extension of our cell injury and repair focus in this review. We hope that a holistic view of injurious stimuli relevant for ARDS and IPF could lead to updated experimental models. In addition, parallel discussion of membrane repair mechanisms in lung cells and injury-activated signaling pathways would encourage research to bridge gaps in current knowledge. Indeed, deep understanding of lung cell wounding and repair, and discovery of relevant repair moieties for lung cells, should inspire the development of new therapies that are likely preventive and broadly effective for targeting injurious pulmonary diseases.","Cong, Xiaofei; Hubmayr, Rolf D; Li, Changgong; Zhao, Xiaoli",American journal of physiology.

138677,Socioeconomic status and well-being during COVID-19: A resource-based examination.,2020-10-22,"INTRODUCTION Asthma affects millions of children worldwide-1.1 million children in the UK. Asthma symptoms cannot be cured but can be controlled with low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) in the majority of individuals. Treatment with a low-dose ICS, however, fails to control asthma symptoms in around 10%-15% of children and this places the individual at increased risk for an asthma attack. At present, there is no clear preferred treatment option for a child whose asthma is not controlled by low-dose ICS and international guidelines currently recommend at least three treatment options. Herein, we propose a systematic review and individual participant data network meta-analysis (IPD-NMA) aiming to synthesise all available published and unpublished evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to establish the clinical effectiveness of pharmacological treatments in children and adolescents with uncontrolled asthma on ICS and help to make evidence-informed treatment choices. This will be used to parameterise a Markov-based economic model to assess the cost-effectiveness of alternative treatment options in order to inform decisions in the context of drug formularies and clinical guidelines. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will search in MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Embase, NICE Technology Appraisals and the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment series for RCTs of interventions in patients with uncontrolled asthma on ICS. All studies where children and adolescents were eligible for inclusion will be considered, and authors or sponsors will be contacted to request IPD on patients aged <18. The reference lists of existing clinical guidelines, along with included studies and relevant reviews, will be checked to identify further relevant studies. Unpublished studies will be located by searching across a range of clinical trial registries, including internal trial registers for pharmaceutical companies. All studies will be appraised for inclusion against predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria by two independent reviewers with disagreements resolved through discussion with a third reviewer. We will perform an IPD-NMA-eventually supplemented with aggregate data for the RCTs without IPD-to establish both the probability that a treatment is best and the probability that a particular treatment is most likely to be effective for a specific profile of the patient. The IPD-NMA will be performed for each outcome variable within a Bayesian framework, using the WinBUGS software. Also, potential patient-level characteristics that may modify treatment effects will be explored, which represents one of the strengths of this study. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The Committee on Research Ethics, University of Liverpool, has confirmed that ethics review is not required. The dissemination plan consists of publishing the results in an open-access medical journal, a plain-language summary available for parents and children, dissemination via local, national and international meetings and conferences and the press offices of our Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). A synopsis of results will be disseminated to NICE and British Thoracic Society/Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) as highly relevant to future clinical guideline updates.

To date, there are no published reports on use of recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) for STEC detection. The primary goal of this study was to assess the potential application of RPA in detection of STEC. This study focused on designing and evaluating RPA primers and fluorescent probes for isothermal (39°C) detection of STEC. Compatible sets of candidate primers and probes were designed for detection of Shiga toxin 1 and 2 (Stx1 and 2), respectively. The sets were evaluated for specificity and sensitivity against STEC (n=12) of various stx genotypes (stx1/stx2, stx1, or stx2, respectively), including non-Stx-producing E. coli (n=28) and other genera (n=7). The primers and probes that were designed targeted amplification of the subunit A moiety of stx1 and stx2. The assay detected STEC in real time (within 5-10 min at 39°C) with high sensitivity (93.5% vs. 90%; stx1 vs. stx2), specificity (99.1% vs. 100%; stx1 vs. stx2), and predictive value (97.9% for both stx1 vs. stx2). Limits of detection of ∼ 5-50 colony-forming units/mL were achieved in serially diluted cultures grown in brain heart infusion broth.

RESULTS Twelve pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 were included in this study. Mean age was 32 ± 7.9 years. All patients had mild symptoms and were followed in the maternity ward, with none of them needing critical care unit follow-up. All lower genital tract samples were negative for SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION We demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 was not present in the vaginal fluid of pregnant women. This finding may indicate that the female genital tract is not a route of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","Aslan, Mehmet Musa; Uslu Yuvacı, Hilal; Köse, Osman; Toptan, Hande; Akdemir, Nermin; Köroğlu, Mehmet; Cevrioğlu, Arif Serhan; Özden, Selçuk","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",https://doi.org/10.1080/14767058.2020.1793318; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32669014/,273

The differences in surgical outcomes, such as docking time, console time, hospital stay, estimated blood loss, Hb change, myoma count, and weight, also did not differ between the two groups. On the contrary, the number of port site was only 2 in RPRS compared with 4-5 in multiport robot-assisted laparoscopic myomectomy.

RESULTS Eighty questionnaire responses (40 with symptom/s and 40 without) paired with isolation of viral respiratory pathogen from nasal samples were obtained from 53 children with SCD, ages 4 to 18 years over 2 separate periods in different seasons. The questionnaire yielded a sensitivity of 82%, specificity of 72% with an overall accuracy of 76%. The kappa value was 0.53, indicating moderate agreement, and the Fleiss' kappa test statistic was 4.77 with P<0.001, indicating that agreement between the 2 methods was not by chance. CONCLUSION These results provide evidence for validity of this 6-symptom respiratory questionnaire in identification of respiratory viral infections for use in SCD-related research.","De, Aliva; Anekwe, Chika V; Kattan, Meyer; Yao, Yujing; Jin, Zhezhen; Brittenham, Gary M; Lee, Margaret T",Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,https://doi.org/10.1097/mph.0000000000002164; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33885042/,273

Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are at increased risk of viral infections, and recent data suggests they may be at an increased risk of poor outcomes with COVID-19. This may be particularly true for those on rituximab or high dose steroids. A huge international effort from the scientific community has so far resulted in the temporary authorisation of three vaccines which offer protection against SARS-CoV-2, with over 30 other vaccines being evaluated in ongoing trials. Although there has historically been concern that vaccines may trigger disease flares of SLE, there is little convincing evidence to show this. In general lupus patients appear to gain good protection from vaccination, although there may be reduced efficacy in those with high disease activity or those on immunosuppressive therapies, such as rituximab or high dose steroids. Recent concerns have been raised regarding rare clotting events with the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine and it is currently unknown whether this risk is higher for those patients with secondary antiphospholipid syndrome. With the possibility of annual COVID vaccination programmes in the future, prospective data collection and registries looking at the effect of vaccination on SLE disease control, the incidence of COVID-19 in SLE patients and severity of COVID-19 disease course would all be useful. As mass vaccination programmes begin to roll out across the world, we assess the evidence of the use of vaccines in SLE patients and in particular vaccines targeting SARS-CoV-2.","Mason, Alice; Anver, Himashi; Lwin, May; Holroyd, Christopher; Faust, Saul N; Edwards, Christopher J",Lupus,https://doi.org/10.1177/09612033211024355; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34134555/,273

Inserting a transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) probe has been shown to increase tracheal cuff pressure. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of inserting a TOE probe on tracheal cuff pressure and compare the effect in patients who received a single-lumen endotracheal tube (SLT) with those who received a double-lumen endotracheal tube (DLT). DESIGN A prospective, observational study. SETTING Single-centre trial, study period from October 2013 to January 2014. PATIENTS Forty-four adult patients scheduled for elective cardiothoracic surgery requiring intraoperative TOE monitoring. INTERVENTIONS After tracheal intubation with a SLT (n = 22) or DLT (n = 22), the tracheal cuff was inflated to 18 mmHg (25 cmH2O) with air. Tracheal cuff pressure was monitored continuously for 5 min after inserting the TOE probe. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary endpoint was steady-state tracheal cuff pressure after insertion of the TOE probe. RESULTS Median (interquartile range, IQR) tracheal cuff pressure stabilised at 3 (2 to 3) min in the SLT group and at 2 (1 to 3) min in the DLT group. Steady-state cuff pressure was significantly higher in the DLT group than that in the SLT group [36.7 (31.3 to 44.1) vs. 31.3 (29.6 to 35.7) cmH2O; (P = 0.03)]. Steady-state cuff pressure more than 40 cmH2O was observed in two patients (18.2%) in the SLT group and nine patients (40.9%) in the DLT group (P = 0.02). CONCLUSION Insertion of a TOE probe increased tracheal cuff pressure in both the SLT and DLT groups. The increase in cuff pressure was greater in patients who received a DLT. Frequent measurement and adjustment of cuff pressure should be emphasised particularly when TOE is used in patients receiving a DLT.

For the compounds with unfree GMs, ellagic acid and hexahydroxydiphenoyl group contributed to the enzyme inhibition. Free GMs could bind not only with the active site of α-glucosidase (competitive inhibition character), but also with the non-active sites (uncompetitive one); however, the former binding interaction was stronger than the latter one. All polyphenols that had inhibitory effects quenched α-glucosidase fluorescence in a static mode through forming a polyphenol-enzyme complex. The number of amino acid residues involved in polyphenol-enzyme binding interactions (hydrogen bonding and π-conjugations) increased with the inhibitory activity increasing.

This study was designed to verify the presence of POVD, including a variety of asymptomatic as well as symptomatic visual dysfunctions after cardiovascular surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). DESIGN A prospective observational study. SETTING Cardiothoracic surgery in a medical university hospital. PARTICIPANTS Seventy-one patients undergoing elective cardiovascular surgery with CPB. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS All patients were assessed by a battery of 7 neuro-ophthalmic examinations preoperatively and postoperatively, including fundus, visual field, eye movement, color vision, visual acuity, intraocular pressure, and critical flicker frequency. Patients were considered to have POVD if they had postoperative new abnormal findings of neuro-ophthalmic examinations. One patient was excluded due to a failure of postoperative neuro-ophthalmic examinations. In 16 of 70 patients analyzed in this study, selective cerebral perfusion was required for aortic arch surgery. Of 70 patients, a total of 8 patients (11.4%) had postoperative new abnormal findings in neuro-ophthalmic examinations, including new visual field deficits in 4, reduced visual acuity in 4, and/or increased intraocular pressure in 1 patient. Of these 8 patients, symptomatic POVD was recognized in 1 patient (1.4%) with postoperative visual field deficit and reduced visual acuity. There were no new abnormal findings compared with preoperative results in postoperative funduscopy, eye movement, color vision, and critical flicker frequency. CONCLUSIONS These results indicated that the asymptomatic as well as symptomatic POVD can develop after cardiovascular surgery with CPB, and their incidence may be relatively high.","Hayashi, Hironobu; Kawaguchi, Masahiko; Okamoto, Masahiro; Hasuwa, Kyoko; Matsuura, Toyoaki; Taniguchi, Shigeki; Furuya, Hitoshi",Journal of cardiothoracic and vascular anesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1053/j.jvca.2013.01.026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24054186/,273
152032,Risk Reduction of COVID-19 Pandemic in Pakistan.,2020-08-18,"1. Heterogeneity of host behaviour can play an important role in the spread of parasites and pathogens around wildlife populations. Social networks have previously been suggested to represent transmission pathways within a population, but where the dynamics of host-parasite interactions are difficult to observe, networks may also be used to provide insights into transmission processes. 2. Pygmy bluetongue lizards, Tiliqua adelaidensis, occupy individual territories, live exclusively in burrows constructed by spiders in Australian native grasslands and are hosts to a tick, Bothriocroton hydrosauri, and a nematode, Pharyngodon wandillahensis. 3. On five monthly occasions, the locations of all individual lizards in three study plots were used to construct weighted, undirected networks based on proximity of adjacent burrows. 4. The networks were used to explore alternative hypotheses about the spread of each parasite through the population: that stable population members that remained in the same burrow over the study period played a major role in influencing the pattern of infection or that dispersing individuals played a more significant role. 5. For ticks, host individuals that were infected were more connected in the network than uninfected hosts and this relationship remained significant for connections to residents in the population, but not for connections to dispersers. 6. For nematodes, infected and uninfected hosts did not differ in their overall strength of connection in the network, but infected hosts were more connected to dispersers than were uninfected hosts, suggesting that lizards moving across the population are the major agents for the transmission of nematodes. 7. This study shows how network analyses can provide new insights into alternative pathways of parasite spread in wildlife populations, where it is difficult to make direct observations of transmission-related behaviours.","Fenner, Aaron L; Godfrey, Stephanie S; Michael Bull, C",The Journal of animal ecology,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2011.01825.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21644975/,273

In April 2020, the US FDA exercised enforcement discretion for the temporary use of inpatient CGM during the pandemic, thus hospitals were presented the opportunity to implement this technology. METHODS We sought to investigate the accuracy of CGM in hospitalized patients on general care floors and the intensive care unit (ICU) in attempts to decrease healthcare professional exposure to COVID-19 and ultimately improve glycemic management of patients affected by COVID-19. Point of care (POC) and laboratory (Lab) glucose values were matched with simultaneous CGM glucose values and measures of accuracy were performed to evaluate the safety and usability of CGM in this population. Our data are presented drawing a distinction between POC and Lab as reference glucose sources. RESULTS In 808 paired samples obtained from 28 patients (10 ICU, 18 general floor), overall mean absolute relative difference (MARD) for all patients using either POC or Lab as reference was 13.2%. When using POC as the reference glucose MARD was 13.9% and using Lab glucose as reference 10.9%. Using both POC and Lab reference glucose pairs the overall MARD for critical care patients was 12.1% and for general floor patients 14%. CONCLUSION We determined, with proper protocols and safeguards in place, use of CGM in the hospitalized patient is a reasonable alternative to standard of care to achieve the goal of reducing healthcare professional exposure. Further study is necessary to validate safety, accuracy, and efficacy of this technology. Investigation and analysis are necessary for the development of protocols to utilize CGM trend arrows, alerts, and alarms.","Longo, Rebecca Rick; Elias, Heather; Khan, Mehvish; Seley, Jane Jefferie",Journal of diabetes science and technology,https://doi.org/10.1177/19322968211008446; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33971753/,273

The purpose of this review was to critically evaluate patient decision aids (PtDAs) developed to support patient-professional shared decision-making between dialysis and conservative management treatment pathways. METHODS We performed a systematic review of resources accessible in English using environmental scan methods. Data sources included online databases of research publications, repositories for clinical guidelines, research projects and PtDAs, international PtDA expert lists and reference lists from relevant publications. The resource selection was from 56 screened records; 17 PtDAs were included. A data extraction sheet was applied to all eligible resources, eliciting resource characteristics, decision architecture to boost/bias thinking, indicators of quality such as International Standards for Patient Decision Aids Standards checklist and engagement with health services. RESULTS PtDAs were developed in five countries; eleven were publically available via the Internet. Treatment options described were dialysis (n = 17), conservative management (n = 9) and transplant (n = 5). Eight resources signposted conservative management as an option rather than an active choice. Ten different labels across 14 resources were used to name 'conservative management'. The readability of the resources was good. Six publications detail decision aid development and/or evaluation research. Using PtDAs improved treatment decision-making by patients. Only resources identified as PtDAs and available in English were included. CONCLUSIONS PtDAs are used by some services to support patients choosing between dialysis options or end-of-life options. PtDAs developed to proactively support people making informed decisions between conservative management and dialysis treatments are likely to enable services to meet current best practice.","Winterbottom, Anna E; Mooney, Andrew; Russon, Lynne; Hipkiss, Vicki; Ziegler, Lucy; Williams, Richard; Finderup, Jeanette; Bekker, Hilary L","Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association",https://doi.org/10.1093/ndt/gfaa102; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830240/,273
154140,"Impact of Information Exposure on Perceived Risk, Efficacy, and Preventative Behaviors at the Beginning of the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States.",2020-11-12,"Rice stripe virus (RSV) is the causative agent of rice stripe disease and is completely dependent on insect vectors for its plant-to-plant transmission. Laodelphax striatellus is the major insect vector for RSV. In this study, we explored the interactions between RSV infection and L. striatellus autophagy, a potential intrinsic antiviral mechanism in insects. We found that the L. striatellus autophagic activity did not affect RSV infection; however, the autophagy-related-8 (Atg8) gene significantly enhanced virus infection. During RSV initial infection within the L. striatellus midgut, silencing of Atg8 expression significantly decreased the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (p-JNK); however, when RSV infection is absent, silencing of Atg8 did not alter p-JNK level. These results indicated that Atg8 might activate the JNK machinery by allowing more virus infected into cells. We further revealed that Atg8-deficiency significantly decreased RSV accumulation on the surface of the insect midgut epithelial cells, suggesting a receptor trafficking function of the GABARAP family proteins. Using the RSV ovary entry as a model, in which vitellogenin receptor (VgR) mediates RSV cell entry, we clarified that Atg8-deficiency decreased the abundance of VgR localizing on the cytomembrane and disturbed the attachment of RSV in the germarium zones. Collectively, these results revealed an autophagy-independent function of L. striatellus Atg8 that enhances RSV initial infection by increasing virus attachment on the infection sites.

154962,Rural-related epidemiology of COVID-19 cases in Queensland.,2020-12-01,"KEY POINTS While it has been well described that prolonged vibration locally applied to a muscle or its tendon (up to 1 h) decreases spinal loop excitability between homonymous Ia afferents and motoneurons, the involved mechanisms are not fully understood. By combining electrophysiological methods, this study aimed to provide new insights on the mechanisms involved in LV post-effect in SOL spinal excitability after prolonged LV. We reported that prolonged vibration induces a decrease in motoneuron excitability rather than an increase in presynaptic mechanisms (as commonly hypothesized in the current literature) The present results may help to design appropriate clinical intervention and could reinforce the interest of vibration as a treatment in spastic patients who are characterized by spinal hyper-excitability responsible for spasms and long-lasting reflexes. ABSTRACT The mechanisms that can explain the decreased spinal loop excitability in response to prolonged local vibration (LV), as assessed by the H-reflex, remain to be precisely determined. This study provides new insights on how prolonged Achilles tendon LV (30 min, 100 Hz) acutely interacts with the spinal circuitry. The roles of presynaptic inhibition exerted on Ia afferents (Experiment A, n = 15), neurotransmitter release at the synapse level (Experiment B, n = 11) and motoneuron excitability (Experiment C, n = 11) were investigated in soleus (SOL). Modulation of presynaptic inhibition was assessed by conditioning the SOL H-reflex (tibial nerve electrical stimulation) with fibular nerve (D1 inhibition) and femoral nerve (heteronymous facilitation, HF) electrical stimulations. Potential vibration-induced changes in neurotransmitter depletion at the Ia afferent terminals was assessed through paired stimulations applied over the tibial nerve (HD). Intrinsic motoneuron excitability was assessed with thoracic motor evoked potentials (TMEPs) in response to electrical stimulation over the thoracic spine. Non-conditioned H-reflex was depressed by ∼60% after LV (p < 0.001), while D1 and HF H-reflexes increased by ∼75% after LV (p = 0.03 and 0.06, respectively). In Experiment B, HD remained unchanged at POST (p = 0.80). In Experiment C, TMEPs were reduced by ∼13% at POST (p = 0.01). Overall, presynaptic mechanisms do not seem to be involved in the depression of spinal excitability after LV. It rather seems to rely, at least in part, on a decrease in intrinsic motoneuron excitability. These results may have implications in reducing spinal hyper-excitability in spastic patients.

In addition to the complex pathophysiology of male genital pain, the responsibility of opioid stewardship in the face of the ongoing narcotics epidemic presents its own set of challenges to experienced implanters. Recent innovations in pre- and intra-operative analgesia have provided some improvement in patient-reported pain outcomes. When used together in protocols spanning each phase of operative care, multimodal analgesia (MMA) regimens provide superior patient pain control and successfully decrease opioid usage compared to traditional opioid-based pain control. This review will systematically present literature that discusses interventions in the preoperative and intraoperative spaces aimed at optimally controlling pain. We will also highlight surgical techniques that have been demonstrated to help ameliorate post-operative pain in penile implant recipients. We will discuss the impact of MMA protocols across urology and further explore its larger impact on reducing opioid burden in the ongoing epidemic.","Ellis, Jeffrey L; Sudhakar, Architha; Simhan, Jay",Translational andrology and urology,https://doi.org/10.21037/tau-20-1220; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34295750/,273

They are abundant in the human peripheral blood and also enriched in mucosal layers and in the lungs, SARS-CoV-2's main ports of entry. Once activated, MAIT cells produce inflammatory cytokines and cytolytic effector molecules quickly and copiously. MAIT cells are best known for their antibacterial and antifungal properties. However, they are also activated during viral infections, typically in a cytokine-dependent manner, which may promote antiviral immunity. On the other hand, it is plausible to assume active roles for MAIT cells in infection-provoked cytokine storms and tissue damage. SARS-CoV-2 infection may be asymptomatic, mild, severe, or even fatal, depending on sex, age, the presence of preexisting morbidities, and the individual's immunological competence, or lack thereof, among other factors. Based on the available literature, I propose that MAIT cells regulate the host response to SARS-CoV-2 and constitute attractive targets in the prevention or clinical management of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) and some of its complications. Unlike mainstream T cells, MAIT cells are restricted by a monomorphic antigen-presenting molecule called MHC-related protein 1 (MR1). Therefore, MR1 ligands should modify MAIT cell functions relatively uniformly in genetically diverse subjects and may be tested as immunotherapeutic agents or vaccine adjuvants in future studies.","Haeryfar, S M Mansour",Critical reviews in immunology,https://doi.org/10.1615/critrevimmunol.2020034943; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32749095/,273

DESIGN Service evaluation. SETTING Gynaecology outpatient services at a tertiary referral hospital. POPULATION Patients who received a TC during May and June 2020. METHODS Postal questionnaire combining 3 validated tools: QQ-10, Patient Enablement Index (PEI) and NHS Friends and Family Test (NHS-FFT). Quantitative data and free text responses were analysed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Responses to QQ-10, PEI and NHS-FFT. RESULTS In total, 1307 patients were contacted and 504 patients responded (39%). Most (89%) described their experience as 'Very good' or 'Good' (NHS-FFT). Positive themes from responses included 'convenience', 'effectiveness' and 'equivalent care'. QQ-10 responses demonstrated a high Value score of 79 (0-100) and a low Burden score of 15. PEI scores suggested that most patients felt better or much better able to understand and cope with their condition following TC. The majority of patients (77%) would 'Strongly' or 'Mostly agree' to a repeat TC. Regarding patient outcomes, 21% were discharged and 71% required follow-up. Menopause, fertility, and endometriosis follow-up clinic patients benefited most from TC. Gynaecology-oncology patients found TC least acceptable. CONCLUSION We report a large questionnaire survey of patient experience of TC in Gynaecology. Telemedicine is convenient, acceptable, and effective for conducting care in selected groups. TC can support patients in communicating intimate symptoms.","Khan, Zarnigar; Kershaw, Victoria; Madhuvrata, Priya; Radley, Tephen; Connor, Mary",BJOG : an international journal of obstetrics and gynaecology,https://doi.org/10.1111/1471-0528.16771; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34033200/,273

During COVID-19, tweets with misinformation should be flagged and neutralised in their early stages to mitigate the damages. Most of the existing methods for early detection of fake news assume to have enough propagation information for large labelled tweets – which may not be an ideal setting for cases like COVID-19 where both aspects are largely absent. In this work, we present ENDEMIC, a novel early detection model which leverages exogenous and endogenous signals related to tweets, while learning on limited labelled data. We first develop a novel dataset, called ECTF for early COVID-19 Twitter fake news, with additional behavioural test-sets to validate early detection. We build a heterogeneous graph with follower-followee, user-tweet, and tweet-retweet connections and train a graph embedding model to aggregate propagation information. Graph embeddings and contextual features constitute endogenous, while time-relative web-scraped information constitutes exogenous signals. ENDEMIC is trained in a semi-supervised fashion, overcoming the challenge of limited labelled data. We propose a co-attention mechanism to fuse signal representations optimally. Experimental results on ECTF, PolitiFact, and GossipCop show that ENDEMIC is highly reliable in detecting early fake tweets, outperforming nine state-of-the-art methods significantly. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Bansal, R.; Paka, W.

We evaluated depression, anxiety, sleep and quality of life in terms of gender, age, occupation and income level during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: A total of 352 individuals participating in this study online in Istanbul were evaluated for depression using the Beck Depression index (BDI) and Beck Anxiety index (BAI), sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality index (PSQI), quality of life using the short form-36 (SF-36) in terms of gender, age, occupation and income level. Results: Although the prevalence of depression was 18.5% and anxiety was 24.5%, sleep quality was poor in 69.5% of the participants. BDI, BAI (p&lt;0.01) and PSQI scores were significantly higher in females, whereas SF-36 scores were low (p&lt;0.05). BDI and BAI scores were high in the 31-40 age group (p=0.006, p=0.023);SF-36 scores, however, were low (p=0.016). No difference by age in the PSQI scores was noted. Although the PSQI score was highest among healthcare workers, BDI score was highest among students. No difference in BAI and SF-36 scores was recorded by profession. BDI (p&lt;0.05), BAI and PSQI scores of the high-income group were lower whereas SF-36 scores were higher (p&lt;0.01). Conclusion: In the COVID-19 pandemic, sleep quality deteriorated, and the frequency of depression and anxiety increased. This is particularly associated with the females and the young (&lt;40 years old);however, an inverse relationship was noted with those with a high-income status, and the sleep quality of healthcare workers has become worse.","Kabeloglu, V.; Gül, G.",Journal of Turkish Sleep Medicine,https://doi.org/10.4274/jtsm.galenos.2021.53244,273

The investigation on daily sequential PCR testing of the quarantined subjects indicated the viral load of the first positive test of Delta infections was ~1000 times higher than that of the 19A/19B strains infections back in the initial epidemic wave of 2020, suggesting the potential faster viral replication rate and more infectiousness of the Delta variant at the early stage of the infection. The 126 high-quality sequencing data and reliable epidemiological data indicated some minor intra-host single nucleotide variants (iSNVs) could be transmitted between hosts and finally fixed in the virus population during the outbreak. The minor iSNVs transmission between donor-recipient contribute at least 4 of 31 substitutions identified in the outbreak suggesting some iSNVs more likely to arise and reach fixation when the virus spread rapidly. Disease control measures, including the frequency of population testing, quarantine in pre-symptomatic phase and enhancing the genetic surveillance should be adjusted to account for the increasing prevalence of the Delta variant at global level.","Li, B.; Deng, A.; Li, K.; Hu, Y.; Li, Z.; Xiong, Q.; Liu, Z.; Guo, Q.; Zou, L.; Zhang, H.; Zhang, M.; Ouyang, F.; Su, J.; Su, W.; Xu, J.; Lin, H.; Sun, J.; Peng, J.; Jiang, H.; Zhou, P.; Hu, T.; Luo, M.; Zhang, Y.; Zheng, H.; Xiao, J.; Liu, T.; Che, R.; Zeng, H.; Zheng, Z.; Huang, Y.; Yu, J.; Yi, L.; Wu, J.; Chen, J.; Zhong, H.; Deng, X.; Kang, m.; Pybus, O.

171706,Transitioning to parenthood during the pandemic: COVID-19 related stressors and first-time expectant mothers’ mental health,2021,"The paper reviews Georgia's digital trust formation process and underlines the most important challenges for the online business sector. This research can be generalized for most developing countries where the digital transition process is on the agenda, especially for countries that have recently emerged from economic-political transition. Georgia has completed the transition from a centrally planned economic system (the heritage of being part of the Soviet Union) to a free market economy. Although trust in institutions is improving gradually, mistrust in business processes is still a great challenge for local business sectors. A wide-reaching lockdown caused by the 2020-2021 COVID-19 pandemic pushed both firms and individuals further towards online activity worldwide. In this regard, trust has become the key determinant in facilitating electronic transactions. Technological advances are providing dozens of tools to improve customer satisfaction and trust, which should lead to customer loyalty. On the other hand, lack of digital skills and digital security problems raises digital untrust concerns. Therefore, trust research in the digital economy is becoming more actual for academic or business studies. Digital trust is a multidimensional factor that is under the influence of digital and physical operations. In Georgia, businesses have to overcome obstacles built-in people's minds as a heritage of the Soviet Union. Georgia was a part of the Soviet Union for 70 years, which critically degraded the trust of both formal and informal institutions. Therefore, building digital trust in business is getting more complex as it includes traditional trust problems and digital challenges too. The main research purpose in this paper is to present the digital trust forming process in Georgia to reveal the major problems. This study involved the trust stack model in analysing three different stages of trust formation in the Georgian digital economy (trust in the idea, trust in the platform, trust in the individual). The research identified challenges and steps which should be carried out soon. Research academic findings and methodological approaches can be used to analyze other developing countries whose economies are influenced by the digital transformation process.","Zhghenti, T.; Chkareuli, V.",Marketing and Management of Innovations,https://doi.org/10.21272/mmi.2021.2-07,273

For the monitoring of machines with rotary components, sound and vibration emitted from the machines have been utilized as the meaningful information. However, sound sensors are susceptible to external noise and the costs for signal conditioning should be considered. In this paper, a stethoscope is utilized as an internal sound sensor which are capable of noise reduction and affordable as IoT solutions. After the stethoscope was assembled with a microphone, a frequency range for measurement was identified as 0~255Hz using the swept-sine technique. Two stethoscope sensors were attached to an industrial robot, and the capability of noise reduction is verified by similarity of Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) spectrograms from sounds with and without existence of factory noise. Next, impact tests were performed to detect collision when the robot was stationary, and collisions by human hand during robot operation were detected from STFT spectrogram analysis. Finally, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model from the spectrograms was established to estimate a rotating joint axis during operation, showing 91% and 90.83% accuracy for each stethoscope, respectively.","Yun, Huitaek; Kim, Hanjun; Kim, Eunseob; Jun, Martin B.G.",Procedia Manufacturing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2351978920315997; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920315997,273

Under the conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals whose work could be done with digital tools were directed to work remotely. Performing work duties at a distance from the workplace, colleagues, and supervisors affects the workplace resources available to employees and can have an impact on employee well-being. The main purpose of this paper is to analyse the relationship between remote working and employee well-being. The research hypothesis was that there is a relationship between employee well-being and the level of digitisation of work performed, as measured by the frequency of remote working. This article presents the results of empirical research conducted in January 2021, using the CAWI method, on a representative sample of Polish workers (n = 1000). An exploratory factor analysis and logistic regression were carried out. The results point to the three-dimensional nature of employee well-being, which includes workplace relationships, health, and work–life balance. Based on the results, working exclusively remotely was shown to negatively affect well-being in terms of workplace relationships and work–life balance. There was no statistically significant association between remote working and subjective health assessment. The results have important implications for the management of employee well-being in remote working settings. Originality/value lies in the fact that the article provides practical guidance in planning hybrid work arrangements.","Juchnowicz, Marta Kinowska Hanna",Information,https://doi.org/10.3390/info12080293,273

Although majority of patients with COVID-19 experience respiratory symptoms, pain is also a very important symptom. The condition of 15-20% of patients is serious and requires hospitalization. Despite the fact that the disease was initially referred to as a respiratory disease, it often affects other systems as well;the most common are the cardiovascular, urologic and nervous system. Multi-organ involvement increases the need for intensive care and treatment of several consequences caused by the disease. Due to severity of the disease, the management of complications following release from hospital should also be considered. The provision of multidisciplinary care that supports both physical and mental recovery in the initial stages of hospitalization can minimize the damage. Cognitive, physical and mental dysfunction reported by COVID-19 patients after discharge may have significant impact on the quality of human life. Pain is usually part of the dysfunction.

178316,Maternal Attentional Control Moderates the Association Between Increased Depression and Controlling Feeding Practices During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) by anammox bacteria contributes significantly to the global nitrogen cycle, and plays a major role in sustainable wastewater treatment. Anammox bacteria convert ammonium (NH4+) to dinitrogen gas (N2) using nitrite (NO2−) or nitric oxide (NO) as the electron acceptor. In the absence of NO2− or NO, anammox bacteria can couple formate oxidation to the reduction of metal oxides such as Fe(III) or Mn(IV). Their genomes contain homologs of Geobacter and Shewanella cytochromes involved in extracellular electron transfer (EET). However, it is still unknown whether anammox bacteria have EET capability and can couple the oxidation of NH4+ with transfer of electrons to carbon-based insoluble extracellular electron acceptors. Here we show using complementary approaches that in the absence of NO2−, freshwater and marine anammox bacteria couple the oxidation of NH4+ with transfer of electrons to carbon-based insoluble extracellular electron acceptors such as graphene oxide (GO) or electrodes poised at a certain potential in microbial electrolysis cells (MECs). Metagenomics, fluorescence in-situ hybridization and electrochemical analyses coupled with MEC performance confirmed that anammox electrode biofilms were responsible for current generation through EET-dependent oxidation of NH4+. 15N-labelling experiments revealed the molecular mechanism of the EET-dependent anammox process. NH4+ was oxidized to N2 via hydroxylamine (NH2OH) as intermediate when electrode was the terminal electron acceptor. Comparative transcriptomics analysis supported isotope labelling experiments and revealed an alternative pathway for NH4+ oxidation coupled to EET when electrode is used as electron acceptor compared to NO2−as electron acceptor. To our knowledge, our results provide the first experimental evidence that marine and freshwater anammox bacteria can couple NH4+ oxidation with EET, which is a significant finding, and challenges our perception of a key player of anaerobic oxidation of NH4+ in natural environments and engineered systems.","Shaw, Dario R.; Ali, Muhammad; Katuri, Krishna P.; Gralnick, Jeffrey A.; Reimann, Joachim; Mesman, Rob; van Niftrik, Laura; Jetten, Mike S.

This challenges universities that extensively investigated educational technologies. Stakeholders are keen to understand the underlying factors and mechanisms that influence technology adoption. However, the extant contradictive and inconsistent research findings from individual country or region fail to address the problem. To provide a holistic view, we follow the PRISMA protocol and synthesize 145 empirical studies across 42 countries and regions from 2001 to 2020. Our main contribution lies in integrating the institutional theory and the elements of country, culture, and university with the decision to adopt VLEs. Specifically, we develop three individual themes and two institutional themes about the factor characteristics. Power distance associates with the institutional cognitive-cultural influence, and long- and short-term orientation affects VLE adoption through the institutional normative facilitation. Masculinity-femininity links to individual cognition, while uncertainty avoidance has a connection with individual digital capability in the VLE adoption processes. We suggest that cultural dimensions should be examined as explanatory variables in future research. Implications and research significance in the COVID-19 pandemic are discussed.

Pseudotyped viruses that mimic SARS-CoV-2 have been widely used for in vitro evaluation because they are available in BSL-2 containment laboratories; however, in vivo application is inadequate. Therefore, animal models that can be instigated with animal BSL-2 will increase opportunities for in vivo evaluations. Methods Hamsters (6-to 10-week-old males) were intratracheally inoculated with luciferase-expressing vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus. The lungs were harvested 24 h after inoculation, and luminescence was measured using an in vivo imaging system. Results Lung luminescence after inoculation with the SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus increased in a dose-dependent manner. VSV-G (envelope [G]) pseudotyped virus also induced luminescence; however, a 100-fold concentration was required to reach a level similar to that of the SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus. Conclusions The SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus is applicable to SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infections in a hamster model. Because of the single-round infectious virus, the model can be used to study the steps from viral binding to entry, which will be useful for future research regarding SARS-CoV-2 entry without using live SARS-CoV-2 or transgenic animals.","Yamada, Hiroshi; Sasaki, Soichiro; Tani, Hideki; Somekawa, Mayu; Kawasuji, Hitoshi; Saga, Yumiko; Yoshida, Yoshihiro; Yamamoto, Yoshihiro; Hayakawa, Yoshihiro; Morinaga, Yoshitomo",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.17.460745,273

Piglets given a pure culture of BVDV-C developed clinical signs similar to those of a mild TGEV infection and recovered by 10 days postexposure. Villous blunting and fusion was observed in the small intestine, and a lymphocyte depletion was observed in Peyer's patches in the ileum. Piglets given a combination of BVDV-C and attenuated TGEV developed clinical signs similar to those of a virulent TGEV infection and were euthanized. The combined infection induced a generalized lymphocyte depletion throughout the lymphatic system and villous atrophy in the intestinal tract. Piglets exposed to a another type I strain of BVDV (NY-1) either alone or in combination with the attenuated TGEV had mild clinical signs similar to those of a TGEV infection. Moderate villous atrophy in the ileum and a lymphocyte depletion in the mesenteric lymph node were observed in these piglets postmortem. The data indicate a potential problem for diagnostic laboratories in relation to a diagnosis of virulent TGEV infections and in the field for young piglets exposed to a BVDV-contaminated TGEV vaccine.","Woods, R D; Kunkle, R A; Ridpath, J E; Bolin, S R","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12968752/,273
187210,Conducting Virtual Global Health Engagement (GHE) activities in the Midst of the Global COVID-19 Pandemic: Considerations for the Department of Defense GHE Enterprise.,2021,"The GP3 protein of the IAF-Klop strain of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) was expressed in 293 cells by a recombinant human type 5 adenovirus carrying the open reading frame 3 gene. The protein exhibited a molecular mass of 42 kDa and comigrated with GP3 expressed in PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells. Removal of N-linked glycans from GP3 resulted in a 27-kDa protein (P3), confirming its highly glycosylated nature. Pulse-chase experiments carried out either in the context of PRRSV infection or upon individual expression of GP3 in 293 cells showed that the protein remains completely endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H-sensitive even after 4 h of synthesis. Thus, the transport of GP3 was restricted to the premedial Golgi compartment, presumably the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). However, a minor fraction of GP3 was found to be secreted in the culture medium as a soluble membrane-free form. This released protein (sGP3) was readily identified upon individual expression of GP3 in 293 cells as well as in the context of PRRSV infection, albeit at lower levels. The sGP3 migrated as a smear and displayed a molecular mass ranging from 43 to 53 kDa. The unglycosylated form of sGP3 comigrated with its intracellular deglycosylated counterpart, suggesting that the release from the cell of a subset of GP3 did not result from cleavage of a putative membrane-anchor sequence. Strikingly, unlike GP3, the sGP3 acquired Golgi-specific modifications of its carbohydrate side chains and folded into a disulfide-linked homodimer. Brefeldin A treatment completely abolished the release of sGP3, suggesting that the ER-to-Golgi compartment is an obligatory step in cellular secretion of sGP3. In contrast, 10 mM monensin did not prevent sGP3 release but inhibited the terminal glycosylation that confers on the protein its diffuse pattern. Since GP3 was found to be nonstructural in the case of the North American strain, secretion of a minor fraction of GP3 might be an explanation for its high degree of immunogenicity in infected pigs. Furthermore, this secreted protein might be relevant as a model for further studies on the cellular subcompartments involved in the sorting of proteins to the extracellular milieu.","Mardassi, H; Gonin, P; Gagnon, C A; Massie, B; Dea, S",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9658068/,273

188449,Social support for stress prevention in hospital settings.,2007,"On January 12, 2010, Haiti experienced a magnitude-7.0 earthquake; Haitian government officials estimated that 230,000 persons died and 300,000 were injured. At the time, Haiti had no system capable of providing timely surveillance on a wide range of health conditions. Within 2 weeks, Haiti's Ministry of Public Health and Population (MSPP), the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO), CDC, and other national and international agencies launched the National Sentinel Site Surveillance (NSSS) System. The objectives were to monitor disease trends, detect outbreaks, and characterize the affected population to target relief efforts. Fifty-one hospital and clinic surveillance sites affiliated with the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) were selected to report daily counts by e-mail or telephone for 25 specified reportable conditions. During January 25-April 24, 2010, a total of 42,361 persons had a reportable condition; of these, 54.5% were female, and 32.6% were aged <5 years. Nationally, the three most frequently reported specified conditions were acute respiratory infection (ARI) (16.3%), suspected malaria (10.3%), and fever of unknown cause (10.0%). Injuries accounted for 12.0% of reported conditions. No epidemics or disease clusters were detected. The number of reports decreased over time. NSSS is ongoing and currently transitioning into becoming a long-term national surveillance system for Haiti. NSSS data could assist decision makers in allocation of resources and identifying effective public health interventions. However, data reporting and quality could be improved by additional surveillance education for health-care providers, laboratory confirmation of cases of disease, and Internet-based weekly reporting.",,MMWR.

In an experiment on broiler cockerels, the influence of tannic acid (TA) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) on body weight gain (BWG), feed conversion ratio (FCR), weight of intestine and liver, the activities of serum enzymes LDH, AST, ALT and intestinal absorption function were investigated. 2. Broiler cockerels were given either a commercial diet alone (control group) or a commercial diet with TA (20 g/kg), PEG (10 g/kg) or TA plus PEG (20 + 10 g/kg), for 10 d. 3. On the last day of the experiment, all birds and remaining feed were weighed individually and a sample of blood was taken to measure the serum activities of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). The capacity of intestinal cells for the absorption of D-xylose was measured. Finally all birds were killed humanely and the intestine and liver were weighed. 4. The results showed that TA significantly reduced BWG and FCR, as well as the activity of LDH, AST and ALT. 5. TA also increased the relative weight of the intestine. Adding PEG alone had no effect on any of the measured parameters. 6. However, PEG improved significantly BWG, FCR and the activity of LDH and AST of TA-fed birds. 7. The plasma D-xylose concentration of experimental birds was similar for all dietary treatments most likely because of temporal separation between feeding the dietary TA and administering the D-xylose. 8. It was concluded that the presence of tannins in the GI lumen of the bird was necessary to affect the processes involved in the absorption of simple sugars such as D-xylose, at the level of intestinal absorptive cells.","Mansoori, B; Nodeh, H; Modirsanei, M; Kiaei, M M; Farkhoy, M",British poultry science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17701502/,273

Objective To determine the COVID-19 mortality in transplant recipients. Methods We conducted a search in PubMed and Google scholar databases using the keywords for COVID-19 and transplantation. All related studies between January 1, 2020 and May 7, 2020 were reviewed. All relevant published articles related to COVID-19 in transplant recipients were included. Results 46 articles were included; they studied a total of 320 transplant patients-220 kidney transplant recipients, 42 liver, 19 heart, 22 lung, 8 HSCT, and 9 dual organ transplant recipients. The overall mortality rate was 20% and was variable among different organs and different countries. 65 transplant recipients died of complications attributable to COVID-19; 33 were males (15% of males in this cohort), 8 females (8% of females in this cohort), and 24 whose sex was not determined. They had a median age of 66 (range: 32-87) years. The median transplantation duration was 8 years (range: 30 days to 20 years). The most frequent comorbidity reported was hypertensions followed by diabetes mellitus, obesity, malignancy, ischemic heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The most frequent cause of death reported was acute respiratory distress syndrome. Conclusion Transplant recipients in our cohort had a high mortality rate. However, outcomes were not the same in different countries based on outbreak settings. Mortality was noted in elder patients with comorbidities.","Alfishawy, M; Elbendary, A; Mohamed, M; Nassar, M",International journal of organ transplantation medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33335696/,273
191847,Traditional Vietnamese health and healing.,2008,"UNLABELLED We surveyed health care professionals about their preparations to manage the clinical problems associated with patients exposed to hazardous substances, including weapons of mass destruction (WMD). Training for WMD is considered a key part of public health policy and preparedness. Although such events are rare, when they do occur, they can cause mass casualties. In many models of mass casualty management, anesthesiology personnel are responsible for treating patients immediately on arrival at the hospital. We studied the extent of training offered to anesthesiology personnel in the use of WMD protective gear and patient management in United States (US) anesthesiology residency programs. Information was obtained via an online survey to all program directors and chair persons of anesthesiology programs. We polled all of the 135 US anesthesiology programs of which 90 (67%) responded. Only 37% had any form of training, and many of them did not repeat training after initial sessions. Twenty-eight percent of programs east of the Mississippi River reported some form of training whereas only 17% of programs west of it reported training available. The majority of anesthesia residency programs in the US that responded to our survey provided little or no training in the management of patients exposed to WMD. IMPLICATIONS In an attack involving weapons of mass destruction or toxic chemicals, anesthesiologists will provide care. Our survey of United States anesthesiology residency programs demonstrated that there is limited training of residents regarding the anesthetic management of patients injured by weapons of mass destruction. This has serious public health implications.","Candiotti, Keith A; Kamat, Aimee; Barach, Paul; Nhuch, Fani; Lubarsky, David; Birnbach, David J",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16192534/,273

METHODS Online questionnaire surveys were conducted among 3 600 primary school students aged 6-12 years in Jilin Province, China in April, 2020 (during the epidemic) and 3 089 primary school students in September, 2020 (during the regular epidemic prevention and control). The general information and the data related to the Mental Health Scale for Child and Adolescent were collected by the questionnaire surveys. The multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the factors influencing the mental health status of the students during the epidemic. RESULTS The students during the epidemic had a significantly poorer mental health status in the emotional experience and volitional behavior than those during the regular epidemic prevention and control (P < 0.05). The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed the risk of psychological problems of the students decreased with age (OR=0.895). The girls were at a higher risk of psychological problems than boys (OR=1.453). The students with father's and mother's charater between irritability and gentle were at a lower risk of psychological problems (OR=0.496 and 0.470 respectively). The students from a family with a parental education style of a combination of encouraging and scolding were at a lower risk of psychological problems (OR=0.263). The students from a single-parent family or an extended family were at a higher risk of psychological problems (OR=2.995 and 3.446 respectively). CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 epidemic has a certain impact on emotional experience and volitional behavior of primary school students. During the epidemic, particular attention should be paid to the mental health of primary school students, especially girls, younger students, and students from single-parent families, extended families or families with impatient parents and improper parental education.","Zhao, Zhi-Ruo; Zeng, Fan-Jie; Ren, Wen-Jing; Song, Ya-Lan; Tian, Jing; Li, Ping",Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34130786/,273

Following inoculation, anterior rhinoscopy and objective registrations of nasal mucosal temperature, nasal discharge weight, and nasal blockage index by peak expiratory air flow, were followed twice daily for 6 days. Mucosal plasma exudation, as assessed by fibrinogen in lavage fluids, increased hundredfold after virus inoculation, concomitantly with the subjective symptoms and objective physiological changes. We propose that this exudation reflects the degree of subepithelial inflammation, and suggests that plasma bulk exudate, including all potent plasma protein systems may be involved in the resolution of acute viral rhinitis--common cold.","Akerlund, A; Greiff, L; Andersson, M; Bende, M; Alkner, U; Persson, C G",Acta oto-laryngologica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8266793/,273

METHODS In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we evaluated the efficacy of certolizumab pegol in 662 adults with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease. Patients were stratified according to baseline levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and were randomly assigned to receive either 400 mg of certolizumab pegol or placebo subcutaneously at weeks 0, 2, and 4 and then every 4 weeks. Primary end points were the induction of a response at week 6 and a response at both weeks 6 and 26. RESULTS Among patients with a baseline CRP level of at least 10 mg per liter, 37% of patients in the certolizumab group had a response at week 6, as compared with 26% in the placebo group (P=0.04). At both weeks 6 and 26, the corresponding values were 22% and 12%, respectively (P=0.05). In the overall population, response rates at week 6 were 35% in the certolizumab group and 27% in the placebo group (P=0.02); at both weeks 6 and 26, the response rates were 23% and 16%, respectively (P=0.02). At weeks 6 and 26, the rates of remission in the two groups did not differ significantly (P=0.17). Serious adverse events were reported in 10% of patients in the certolizumab group and 7% of those in the placebo group; serious infections were reported in 2% and less than 1%, respectively. In the certolizumab group, antibodies to the drug developed in 8% of patients, and antinuclear antibodies developed in 2%. CONCLUSIONS In patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease, induction and maintenance therapy with certolizumab pegol was associated with a modest improvement in response rates, as compared with placebo, but with no significant improvement in remission rates.

197567,The Ministry of Health.,1918,"Parent artery occlusion (PAO) is an alternative to surgical clipping or endovascular endosaccular coil embolization for the management of cerebral aneurysms. Most giant and fusiform aneurysms are not amenable to endosaccular coil embolization due to anatomical considerations, such as a broad-neck. However, majority of reports regarding the safety of PAO are based on case series involving a relatively small number of patients. In the present study, a total of 381 consecutive patients with unruptured cerebral aneurysms who were treated with PAO were extracted from the Japanese Registry of Neuroendovascular Therapy (JR-NET) 1 and JR-NET2 database, which are nationwide surveys conducted by the Japanese Society of Neuroendovascular Therapy. The mean age of the 381 patients was 58.1 years, and 59.3% were female. The aneurysmal location included the vertebral artery (42%) and the cavernous portion of internal carotid artery (32%). The aneurysm size and shape consisted of fusiform (45%), giant (25%), and large (22%). Symptomatic lesions were present in 59.8% of the population. Technical success was achieved in 98.4%. The 30-day morbidity and mortality rates were 3.1% and 1.0%, respectively. The most frequent procedure-related complication was ischemic stroke, which occurred in 12.9% (distal embolism, 6.0%; branch occlusion, 3.9%). The 30-day morbidity and mortality rates related to ischemic strokes were 2.1% and 0.3%, respectively. PAO for unruptured aneurysms is feasible with a high technical success rate.

RECENT FINDINGS The concept of 'bystander hepatitis' was cited in studies showing hepatic infiltration of CD8-positive T cells in the setting of extrahepatic infections such as influenza virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome. Diabetic liver lesions include glycogenic hepatopathy (in which poor diabetic control leads to swollen, glycogen-filled hepatocytes without fat, steatohepatitis or fibrosis) and diabetic hepatosclerosis in which there is diffuse perisinusoidal fibrosis (type IV collagen) without zonal predilection. Ground-glass hepatocellular inclusions (positive with periodic acid-Schiff stain for glycogen) were reported in three separate series of patients who were hepatitis B virus-negative, often transplant recipients, immunosuppressed and on multiple medications. A Banff consensus paper expertly compared and contrasted the histologic features which characterize the various causes of late liver allograft dysfunction.

To explore differences between Spanish autonomous communities or according to hospital size and disease incidence in the area. MATERIAL AND METHODS Survey of the heads of 283 EDs in hospitals belonging to or affiliated with Spain's public health service. Respondents evaluated the pandemic's impact on organization, resources, and staff absence from work in March and April 2020. Assessments were for 15-day periods. Results were analyzed overall and by autonomous community, hospital size, and local population incidence rates. RESULTS A total of 246 (87%) responses were received. The majority of the EDs organized a triage system, first aid, and observation wards; areas specifically for patients suspected of having COVID-19 were newly set apart. The nursing staff was increased in 83% of the EDs (with no subgroup differences), and 59% increased the number of physicians (especially in large hospitals and locations where the COVID-19 incidence was high). Diagnostic tests for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 were the resource the EDs missed most: 55% reported that tests were scarce often or very often. Other resources reported to be scarce were FPP2 and FPP3 masks (38% of the EDs), waterproof protective gowns (34%), and space (32%). More than 5% of the physicians, nurses, or other emergency staff were on sick leave 20%, 19%, and 16% of the time. These deficiencies were greatest during the last half of March, except for tests, which were most scarce in the first 15 days. Large hospital EDs less often reported that diagnostic tests were unavailable. In areas where the COVID-19 incidence was higher, the EDs reported higher rates of staff on sick leave. Resource scarcity differed markedly by autonomous community and was not always associated with the incidence of COVID-19 in the population. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic led to organizational changes in EDs.

Hematological manifestations such as thrombocytopenia and reduced lymphocyte and eosinophil numbers are highly prevalent in COVID-19 and have prognostic significance. Few data, however, are available about the prevalence and significance of anemia in COVID-19. In an observational study, we investigated the prevalence, pathogenesis and clinical significance of anemia among 206 patients with COVID-19 at the time of their hospitalization in an Internal Medicine unit. The prevalence of anemia was 61% in COVID-19, compared with 45% in a control group of 71 patients with clinical and laboratory findings suggestive of COVID-19, but nasopharyngeal swab tests negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (p = 0.022). Mortality was higher in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. In COVID-19, females had lower hemoglobin concentration than males and a higher prevalence of moderate/severe anemia (25% versus 13%, p = 0.032). In most cases, anemia was mild and due to inflammation, sometimes associated with iron and/or vitamin deficiencies. Determinants of hemoglobin concentration included: erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum cholinesterase, ferritin and protein concentrations and number of chronic diseases affecting each patient. Hemoglobin concentration was not related to overall survival that was, on the contrary, influenced by red blood cell distribution width, age, lactate dehydrogenase and the ratio of arterial partial oxygen pressure to inspired oxygen fraction. In conclusion, our results highlight anemia as a common manifestation in COVID-19. Although anemia does not directly influence mortality, it usually affects elderly, frail patients and can negatively influence their quality of life.","Bergamaschi, Gaetano; de Andreis, Federica Borrelli; Aronico, Nicola; Lenti, Marco Vincenzo; Barteselli, Chiara; Merli, Stefania; Pellegrino, Ivan; Coppola, Luigi; Cremonte, Elisa Maria; Croce, Gabriele; Mordà, Francesco; Lapia, Francesco; Ferrari, Sara; Ballesio, Alessia; Parodi, Alessandro; Calabretta, Francesca; Ferrari, Maria Giovanna; Fumoso, Federica; Gentile, Antonella; Melazzini, Federica; Di Sabatino, Antonio",Clin. exp. med,,273

203090,Social inequalities and the pandemic of COVID-19: the case of Rio de Janeiro,2021,"Ever since Darwin's discovery of natural selection, we expect traits to evolve to increase organisms' fitness. As a result, we can use optimization models to make a priori predictions of phenotypic variation, even when selection is frequency-dependent. A notable example is the prediction of female-biased sex ratios resulting from local mate competition (LMC) and inbreeding. LMC models incorporate the effects of LMC and inbreeding. Fig wasp sex ratio adjustments fit LMC predictions well. However, the appropriateness of LMC models to fig wasps has been questioned, and the role that a coincidental by-product plays in creating the apparent fit has been clearly illustrated. Here, we show that the sex ratio adjustments of a fig wasp are the result of a dual mechanism. It consists of a standard facultative LMC response favoured by natural selection, as well as a mechanism that may be the result of selection, but that could also be a coincidental by-product. If it is a by-product, the fitness increase is coincidental and natural selection's role was limited to fine-tuning it for higher fitness returns. We further document a case of an apparent fitness-reducing sex ratio adjustment. We conclude that the use of the adaptationist approach demands that our understanding of traits must be remodelled continually to rectify spurious assumptions.","Greeff, Jaco M; Pentz, Karina; Warren, Marié",Proc Biol Sci,,273

204854,Ibn tofail’suniversity students’ satisfaction evaluation towards distance learning and its impacts on the students’ mental health during the covid 19 confinement,2020,"BACKGROUND: Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) commonly present with fever, constitutional symptoms, and respiratory symptoms. However, atypical presentations are also well known. Though isolated mesenteric arterial occlusion associated with COVID-19 has been reported in literature, combined superior mesenteric arterial and venous thrombosis is rare. We report a case of combined superior mesenteric arterial and venous occlusion associated with COVID-19 infection. CASE REPORT: We report a case of a 45-year-old man who was a health care worker who presented to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain. The clinical examination was unremarkable, but imaging revealed acute mesenteric ischemia caused by superior mesenteric artery and superior mesenteric vein occlusion. Imaging of the chest was suggestive of COVID-19 infection, which was later confirmed with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of his nasopharyngeal swab. To date, only 1 case of combined superior mesenteric artery and superior mesenteric vein thrombosis caused by COVID-19 has been reported. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: During the COVID-19 pandemic it is important to keep mesenteric ischemia in the differential diagnosis of unexplained abdominal pain. Routinely adding high-resolution computed tomography of the chest to abdominal imaging should be considered in patients with acute abdomen because it can help to identify COVID-19 immediately. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Amaravathi, Uthayakumar; Balamurugan, Nathan; Muthu Pillai, Vivekanandan; Ayyan, S Manu",J. emerg. med,,273
205774,Lessons learned from pharmacy learner and educator experiences during early stages of COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"In the early phases of the SARS coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, testing focused on individuals fitting a strict case definition involving a limited set of symptoms together with an identified epidemiological risk, such as contact with an infected individual or travel to a high-risk area. To assess whether this impaired our ability to detect and control early introductions of the virus into the UK, we PCR-tested archival specimens collected on admission to a large UK teaching hospital who retrospectively were identified as having a clinical presentation compatible with COVID-19. In addition, we screened available archival specimens submitted for respiratory virus diagnosis, and dating back to early January 2020, for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Our data provides evidence for widespread community circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in early February 2020 and into March that was undetected at the time due to restrictive case definitions informing testing policy. Genome sequence data showed that many of these early cases were infected with a distinct lineage of the virus. Sequences obtained from the first officially recorded case in Nottinghamshire - a traveller returning from Daegu, South Korea - also clustered with these early UK sequences suggesting acquisition of the virus occurred in the UK and not Daegu. Analysis of a larger sample of sequences obtained in the Nottinghamshire area revealed multiple viral introductions, mainly in late February and through March. These data highlight the importance of timely and extensive community testing to prevent future widespread transmission of the virus.","Chappell, Joseph G; Tsoleridis, Theocharis; Clark, Gemma; Berry, Louise; Holmes, Nadine; Moore, Christopher; Carlile, Matthew; Sang, Fei; Debebe, Bisrat J; Wright, Victoria; Irving, William L; Thomson, Brian J; Boswell, Timothy C J; Willingham, Iona; Joseph, Amelia; Smith, Wendy; Khakh, Manjinder; Fleming, Vicki M; Lister, Michelle M; Howson-Wells, Hannah C; Holmes, Edward C; Loose, Matthew W; Ball, Jonathan K; McClure, C Patrick",J. gen. virol,,273

206701,Physical Activity Patterns Of College Students During The Early Stages Of The Covid-19 Pandemic,2021,"The context of the COVID-19 pandemic required the implementation of special measures to ensure the continuity and quality of teaching in higher education. The study presented here aims to identify the differences of opinion between the age categories of students in the first year of the Faculty of Physical Education and Sports in Galati, Romania, regarding teaching, learning and assessment activities on online platforms. A total of 147 students divided into three age groups (under 20 years, 20–30 years and over 30 years) filled out a questionnaire composed of items with closed and free answers, structured on four factors (attractiveness, accessibility, motivation and efficiency), after participating in the online teaching and evaluation act during the first semester of the academic year 2020–2021. Multivariate and univariate tests were applied, identifying the influence of the independent age variable on the dependent variables (aspects measured by the items of the questionnaire). Values were obtained at significant thresholds of F for some of the investigated aspects: boredom induced by online activities, stress value, participation, involvement, motivation and adaptation to the online program, usefulness and quality of teaching process, value of professional training and involvement in disruptive activities. The analysis of the differences between the average scores of the items for the pairs formed by age categories highlighted insignificant values between those under 20 and those aged 20–30, but multiple significant differences between the group of those over 30 and the other two groups. The centralization of free answers by environment (rural and urban) identified the advantages perceived by the students about the online activities (increasing the amount of free time, low financial costs, high accessibility, personal learning pace), the reported disadvantages (technical problems, low concentration, poor socialization) and contradictory proposals to improve activities (continuing online, returning to classical teaching, simplifying the subject, using video materials, involving all students in activities). The paper aims to evaluate the performance of teaching activities performed in the first year of study for the students of physical education and sports, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, involving questionnaires validated by the specialty center at the university. The analysis of the results highlighted a series of extremely important aspects that have a role in the future design of activities and courses.","Mocanu, George Danut Murariu Gabriel Iordan Daniel Andrei Sandu Ion Munteanu Mihaela Orlanda Antonovici",Applied Sciences,,273

207325,Fighting against COVID-19: Innovative strategies for clinical pharmacists,2020,"OBJECTIVE: On 7 April 2020, the Japanese government declared a state of emergency in response to the novel coronavirus outbreak. To estimate the impact of the declaration on regional cities with low numbers of COVID-19 cases, large-scale surveillance to capture the current epidemiological situation of COVID-19 was urgently conducted in this study. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Social networking service (SNS)-based online survey conducted in five prefectures of Japan: Tottori, Kagawa, Shimane, Tokushima and Okayama. PARTICIPANTS: 127 121 participants from the five prefectures surveyed between 24 March and 5 May 2020. INTERVENTIONS: An SNS-based healthcare system named COOPERA (COvid-19: Operation for Personalized Empowerment to Render smart prevention And care seeking) was launched. It asks questions regarding postcode, personal information, preventive actions, and current and past symptoms related to COVID-19. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Empirical Bayes estimates of age-sex-standardised incidence rate (EBSIR) of symptoms and the spatial correlation between the number of those who reported having symptoms and the number of COVID-19 cases were examined to identify the geographical distribution of symptoms in the five prefectures. RESULTS: 97.8% of participants had no subjective symptoms. We identified several geographical clusters of fever with significant spatial correlation (r=0.67) with the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, especially in the urban centres of prefectural capital cities. CONCLUSIONS: Given that there are still several high-risk areas measured by EBSIR, careful discussion on which areas should be reopened at the end of the state of emergency is urgently required using real-time SNS system to monitor the nationwide epidemic.","Yoneoka, Daisuke; Shi, Shoi; Nomura, Shuhei; Tanoue, Yuta; Kawashima, Takayuki; Eguchi, Akifumi; Matsuura, Kentaro; Makiyama, Koji; Uryu, Shinya; Ejima, Keisuke; Sakamoto, Haruka; Taniguchi, Toshibumi; Kunishima, Hiroyuki; Gilmour, Stuart; Nishiura, Hiroshi; Miyata, Hiroaki",BMJ Open,,273

Dysregulated innate immune response in the lung due to viral-entry mediated angiotensin-I-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor downregulation causes endothelial injury in the pulmonary vasculature, inflammatory cytokine release, increased thrombin generation and impaired fibrinolysis. The inflammatory disease process, immobilization with prolonged hospital stay, hypoxia due to extensive lung injury and pre-existing comorbidities can contribute to thromboembolic episodes (TE). The observed risk for TE in COVID-19 is high despite anticoagulation, particularly in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. A high level of clinical suspicion, lower threshold for diagnostic imaging and aggressive early and extended thromboprophylaxis is indicated. The available evidence on the optimal strategies to prevent, diagnose, and treat VTE in patients with COVID-19 is heterogenous, but rapidly evolving.

We report herein the first d0-transition-metal (TM) tellurite with half of the d0-TM-octahedra partially fluorinated, namely, quinary RbTeMo2O8F, which exhibits giant SHG responses (27 times that of KH2PO4 (KDP) and 2.2 times that of KTiOPO4 (KTP) with 1064 and 2100 nm laser radiation, respectively), the largest SHG values among all reported metal tellurites. RbTeMo2O8F also possesses a large band gap (3.63 eV), a wide optical transparency window (0.34-5.40 µm), and a significant birefringence (&#916;n = 0.263 at 546 nm). Theoretical calculations and crystal structure analysis demonstrate that the outstanding SHG responses can be definitively attributed to the uniform alignment of the polarized [MoO5F]/[MoO6] octahedra and the seesaw-like [TeO4], and the consequent favorable summative polarization of the three distinct SHG-active polyhedra, both induced by partial fluorine substitution on the [MoO6] octahedra.","Hu, Yilei; Wu, Chao; Jiang, Xingxing; Wang, Zujian; Huang, Zhipeng; Lin, Zheshuai; Long, Xifa; Humphrey, Mark G; Zhang, Chi",j. am. chem. soc,,273

217136,Unfounded Sexual Assault: Women's Experiences of Not Being Believed by the Police,2020,"BACKGROUND: The unexpected COVID-19 crisis has disrupted medical education and patient care in unprecedented ways. Despite the challenges, the health-care system and patients have been both creative and resilient in finding robust ""temporary"" solutions to these challenges. It is not clear if some of these COVID-era transitional steps will be preserved in the future of medical education and telemedicine. OBJECTIVES: The goal of this commentary is to address the sometimes substantial changes in medical education, continuing medical education (CME) activities, residency and fellowship programs, specialty society meetings, and telemedicine, and to consider the value of some of these profound shifts to ""business as usual"" in the health-care sector. METHODS: This is a commentary is based on the limited available literature, online information, and the front-line experiences of the authors. RESULTS: COVID-19 has clearly changed residency and fellowship programs by limiting the amount of hands-on time physicians could spend with patients. Accreditation Council for Graduate Medicine Education has endorsed certain policy changes to promote greater flexibility in programs but still rigorously upholds specific standards. Technological interventions such as telemedicine visits with patients, virtual meetings with colleagues, and online interviews have been introduced, and many trainees are ""techno-omnivores"" who are comfortable using a variety of technology platforms and techniques. Webinars and e-learning are gaining traction now, and their use, practicality, and cost-effectiveness may make them important in the post-COVID era. CME activities have migrated increasingly to virtual events and online programs, a trend that may also continue due to its practicality and cost-effectiveness. While many medical meetings of specialty societies have been postponed or cancelled altogether, technology allows for virtual meetings that may offer versatility and time-saving opportunities for busy clinicians. It may be that future medical meetings embrace a hybrid approach of blending digital with face-to-face experience. Telemedicine was already in place prior to the COVID-19 crisis but barriers are rapidly coming down to its widespread use and patients seem to embrace this, even as health-care systems navigate the complicated issues of cybersecurity and patient privacy. Regulatory guidance may be needed to develop safe, secure, and patient-friendly telehealth applications. Telemedicine has affected the prescribing of controlled substances in which online counseling, informed consent, and follow-up must be done in a virtual setting. For example, pill counts can be done in a video call and patients can still get questions answered about their pain therapy, although it is likely that after the crisis, prescribing controlled substances may revert to face-to-face visits. LIMITATIONS: The health-care system finds itself in a very fluid situation at the time this was written and changes are still occurring and being assessed. CONCLUSIONS: Many of the technological changes imposed so abruptly on the health-care system by the COVID-19 pandemic may be positive and it may be beneficial that some of these transitions be preserved or modified as we move forward. Clinicians must be objective in assessing these changes and retaining those changes that clearly improve health-care education and patient care as we enter the COVID era.","Shah, Shalini; Diwan, Sudhir; Kohan, Lynn; Rosenblum, David; Gharibo, Christopher; Soin, Amol; Sulindro, Adrian; Nguyen, Quinn; Provenzano, David A",Pain Physician,,273

The purpose of this study was to investigate 62 subjects in Wuhan, China, with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia and describe the CT features of this epidemic disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS. A retrospective study of 62 consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia was performed. CT images and clinical data were reviewed. Two thoracic radiologists evaluated the distribution and CT signs of the lesions and also scored the extent of involvement of the CT signs. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare lesion distribution and CT scores. The chi-square test was used to compare the CT signs of early-phase versus advanced-phase COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS. A total of 62 patients (39 men and 23 women; mean [± SD] age, 52.8 ± 12.2 years; range, 30-77 years) with COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated. Twenty-four of 30 patients who underwent routine blood tests (80.0%) had a decreased lymphocyte count. Of 27 patients who had their erythrocyte sedimentation rate and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level assessed, 18 (66.7%) had an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and all 27 (100.0%) had an elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level. Multiple lesions were seen on the initial CT scan of 52 of 62 patients (83.9%). Forty-eight of 62 patients (77.4%) had predominantly peripheral distribution of lesions. The mean CT score for the upper zone (3.0 ± 3.4) was significantly lower than that for the middle (4.5 ± 3.8) and lower (4.5 ± 3.7) zones (p = 0.022 and p = 0.020, respectively), and there was no significant difference in the mean CT score of the middle and lower zones (p = 1.00). The mean CT score for the anterior area (4.4 ± 4.1) was significantly lower than that for the posterior area (7.7 ± 6.3) (p = 0.003). CT findings for the patients were as follows: 25 patients (40.3%) had ground-glass opacities (GGO), 21 (33.9%), consolidation; 39 (62.9%), GGO plus a reticular pattern; 34 (54.8%), vacuolar sign; 28 (45.2%), microvascular dilation sign; 35 (56.5%), fibrotic streaks; 21 (33.9%), a subpleural line; and 33 (53.2%), a subpleural transparent line. With regard to bronchial changes seen on CT, 45 patients (72.6%) had air bronchogram, and 11 (17.7%) had bronchus distortion. In terms of pleural changes, CT showed that 30 patients (48.4%) had pleural thickening, 35 (56.5%) had pleural retraction sign, and six (9.7%) had pleural effusion. Compared with early-phase disease (&#8804; 7 days after the onset of symptoms), advanced-phase disease (8-14 days after the onset of symptoms) was characterized by significantly increased frequencies of GGO plus a reticular pattern, vacuolar sign, fibrotic streaks, a subpleural line, a subpleural transparent line, air bronchogram, bronchus distortion, and pleural effusion; however, GGO significantly decreased in advanced-phase disease. CONCLUSION. CT examination of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia showed a mixed and diverse pattern with both lung parenchyma and the interstitium involved. Identification of GGO and a single lesion on the initial CT scan suggested early-phase disease. CT signs of aggravation and repair coexisted in advanced-phase disease. Lesions presented with a characteristic multifocal distribution in the middle and lower lung regions and in the posterior lung area. A decreased lymphocyte count and an increased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level were the most common laboratory findings.","Zhou, Shuchang; Wang, Yujin; Zhu, Tingting; Xia, Liming",AJR Am J Roentgenol,,273

This study investigates the emotions and experiences of 15 female Latin American immigrant domestic workers, caregivers in five Andalusian cities (Seville, Cádiz, Málaga, Huelva and Córdoba) (Spain) who were cohabiting with their employees/patients during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, using qualitative research through in-depth interviews and life stories. The results show the moral debt accrued by the caregivers with the family who employ them, while worsening the physical and psychological health of many of the caregivers, due to both work overload and fear of the global pandemic.

223951,Japanese strategy to COVID-19: How does it work?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Until January 18, 2021, coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has infected more than 93 million individuals and has caused a certain degree of panic. Viral pneumonia caused by common viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, human bocavirus, and parainfluenza viruses have been more common in children. However, the incidence of COVID-19 in children was significantly lower than that in adults. The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical manifestations, treatment and outcomes of COVID-19 in children compared with those of other sources of viral pneumonia diagnosed during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: Children with COVID-19 and viral pneumonia admitted to 20 hospitals were enrolled in this retrospective multi-center cohort study. A total of 64 children with COVID-19 were defined as the COVID-19 cohort, of which 40 children who developed pneumonia were defined as the COVID-19 pneumonia cohort. Another 284 children with pneumonia caused by other viruses were defined as the viral pneumonia cohort. The epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory findings were compared by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, t-test, Mann-Whitney U test and Contingency table method. Drug usage, immunotherapy, blood transfusion, and need for oxygen support were collected as the treatment indexes. Mortality, intensive care needs and symptomatic duration were collected as the outcome indicators. RESULTS: Compared with the viral pneumonia cohort, children in the COVID-19 cohort were mostly exposed to family members confirmed to have COVID-19 (53/64 vs. 23/284), were of older median age (6.3 vs. 3.2 years), and had a higher proportion of ground-glass opacity (GGO) on computed tomography (18/40 vs. 0/38, P < 0.001). Children in the COVID-19 pneumonia cohort had a lower proportion of severe cases (1/40 vs. 38/284, P = 0.048), and lower cases with high fever (3/40 vs. 167/284, P < 0.001), requiring intensive care (1/40 vs. 32/284, P < 0.047) and with shorter symptomatic duration (median 5 vs. 8 d, P < 0.001). The proportion of cases with evaluated inflammatory indicators, biochemical indicators related to organ or tissue damage, D-dimer and secondary bacterial infection were lower in the COVID-19 pneumonia cohort than those in the viral pneumonia cohort (P < 0.05). No statistical differences were found in the duration of positive PCR results from pharyngeal swabs in 25 children with COVID-19 who received antiviral drugs (lopinavir-ritonavir, ribavirin, and arbidol) as compared with duration in 39 children without antiviral therapy [median 10 vs. 9 d, P = 0.885]. CONCLUSION: The symptoms and severity of COVID-19 pneumonia in children were no more severe than those in children with other viral pneumonia. Lopinavir-ritonavir, ribavirin and arbidol do not shorten the duration of positive PCR results from pharyngeal swabs in children with COVID-19. During the COVID-19 outbreak, attention also must be given to children with infection by other pathogens infection.","Ren, Guang-Li; Wang, Xian-Feng; Xu, Jun; Li, Jun; Meng, Qiong; Xie, Guo-Qiang; Huang, Bo; Zhu, Wei-Chun; Lin, Jing; Tang, Cheng-He; Ye, Sheng; Li, Zhuo; Zhu, Jie; Tang, Zhen; Ma, Ming-Xin; Xie, Cong; Wu, Ying-Wen; Liu, Chen-Xi; Yang, Fang; Zhou, Yu-Zong; Zheng, Ying; Lan, Shu-Ling; Chen, Jian-Feng; Ye, Feng; He, Yu; Wu, Ben-Qing; Chen, Long; Fu, Si-Mao; Zheng, Cheng-Zhong; Shi, Yuan",Mil Med Res,,273

228095,Environmental health research and the COVID-19 pandemic: A turning point towards sustainability,2021,"To use technology or engage with research or medical treatment typically requires user consent: agreeing to terms of use with technology or services, or providing informed consent for research participation, for clinical trials and medical intervention, or as one legal basis for processing personal data. Introducing AI technologies, where explainability and trustworthiness are focus items for both government guidelines and responsible technologists, imposes additional challenges. Understanding enough of the technology to be able to make an informed decision, or consent, is essential but involves an acceptance of uncertain outcomes. Further, the contribution of AIenabled technologies not least during the COVID-19 pandemic raises ethical concerns about the governance associated with their development and deployment. Using three typical scenarios— contact tracing, big data analytics and research during public emergencies—this paper explores a trustbased alternative to consent. Unlike existing consent-based mechanisms, this approach sees consent as a typical behavioural response to perceived contextual characteristics. Decisions to engage derive from the assumption that all relevant stakeholders including research participants will negotiate on an ongoing basis. Accepting dynamic negotiation between the main stakeholders as proposed here introduces a specifically socio–psychological perspective into the debate about human responses to artificial intelligence. This trust-based consent process leads to a set of recommendations for the ethical use of advanced technologies as well as for the ethical review of applied research projects. © 2021 by the author.

228431,COVID-19: Need for Equitable and Inclusive Pandemic Response Framework,2021,"People with Down syndrome show signs of chronic immune dysregulation, including a higher prevalence of autoimmune disorders, increased rates of hospitalization during respiratory viral infections, and higher mortality rates from pneumonia and sepsis. At the molecular and cellular levels, they show markers of chronic autoinflammation, including interferon hyperactivity, elevated levels of many inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and changes in diverse immune cell types reminiscent of inflammatory conditions observed in the general population. However, the impact of this immune dysregulation in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and CoV disease of 2019 (COVID-19) remains unknown. This Perspective outlines why individuals with Down syndrome should be considered an at-risk population for severe COVID-19. Specifically, the immune dysregulation caused by trisomy 21 may result in an exacerbated cytokine release syndrome relative to that observed in the euploid population, thus justifying additional monitoring and specialized care for this vulnerable population.","Espinosa, Joaquin M",Cell Rep Med,,273

229193,Multidisciplinary research priorities for the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"The closure of day-care centres as a measure to contain the corona virus presented early childhood educators with changed working conditions and opportunities to implement the continuing educational mandate. The cooperation between parents and educators, including through digital tools, plays an important role in this respect. The paper examines a) how often and of what type early childhood educators implemented digitally supported parental cooperation during the closure of day-care centres, b) which attitudes educators had towards general as well as digitally supported parental cooperation, and c) what role their qualifications, their attitudes and their perceived support through the centre played for their digital and non-digital parental cooperation during the closure of day-care centres. The study is based on a nationwide online survey of 3513 early childhood educators in day-care centres during corona closing time. The results show that educators' perceived importance of parental cooperation had a positive influence on whether or not educators had stayed in contact with the parents. Whether this contact occurs via digital media, in turn, depended on educators' attitudes towards digital media, the expected reaction of parents to this form of parental cooperation and the availability of technical support for implementing digital media in parental cooperation. The results are discussed with regard to the structural conditions of institutions and the professional skills of early childhood educators for a broad implementation of digital media in early childhood education practice.","Cohen, Franziska; Oppermann, Elisa; Anders, Yvonne",Z Erziehwiss,,273

This large-scale study characterized immune responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection using multidimensional flow cytometry, with the aim of identifying high-risk immune biomarkers. Holistic and unbiased analyses of 17 immune cell-types were conducted on 1,075 peripheral blood samples obtained from 868 COVID-19 patients and on samples from 24 patients presenting with non-SARS-CoV-2 infections and 36 healthy donors. Immune profiles of COVID-19 patients were significantly different from those of age-matched healthy donors but generally similar to those of patients with non-SARS-CoV-2 infections. Unsupervised clustering analysis revealed three immunotypes during SARS-CoV-2 infection; immunotype 1 (14% of patients) was characterized by significantly lower percentages of all immune cell-types except neutrophils and circulating plasma cells, and was significantly associated with severe disease. Reduced B-cell percentage was most strongly associated with risk of death. On multivariate analysis incorporating age and comorbidities, B-cell and non-classical monocyte percentages were independent prognostic factors for survival in training (n=513) and validation (n=355) cohorts. Therefore, reduced percentages of B-cells and non-classical monocytes are high-risk immune biomarkers for risk-stratification of COVID-19 patients.","Martín-Sánchez, Esperanza; Garcés, Juan José; Maia, Catarina; Inogés, Susana; López-Díaz de Cerio, Ascensión; Carmona-Torre, Francisco; Marin-Oto, Marta; Alegre, Félix; Molano, Elvira; Fernandez-Alonso, Mirian; Perez, Cristina; Botta, Cirino; Zabaleta, Aintzane; Alcaide, Ana Belen; Landecho, Manuel F; Rua, Marta; Pérez-Warnisher, Teresa; Blanco, Laura; Sarvide, Sarai; Vilas-Zornoza, Amaia; Alignani, Diego; Moreno, Cristina; Pineda, Iñigo; Sogbe, Miguel; Argemi, Josepmaria; Paiva, Bruno; Yuste, José Ramón",Front Immunol,,273

234353,Has COVID-19 subverted global health?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, a change in the incidence and transmission of respiratory pathogens was observed. Here, we retrospectively analyzed the impact of COVID-19 on the epidemiologic characteristics of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection among children in Chengdu, one of the largest cities of western China. METHOD: M. pneumoniae infection was diagnosed in 33,345 pediatric patients with respiratory symptoms at the Chengdu Women's & Children's Central Hospital between January 2017 and December 2020, based on a serum antibody titer of &#8805;1:160 measured by the passive agglutination assay. Differences in infection rates were examined by sex, age, and temporal distribution. RESULTS: Two epidemic outbreaks occurred between October-December 2017 and April-December 2019, and two infection peaks were detected in the second and fourth quarters of 2017, 2018, and 2019. Due to the public health response to COVID-19, the number of positive M. pneumoniae cases significantly decreased in the second quarter of 2020. The number of M. pneumoniae infection among children aged 3-6 years was higher than that in other age groups. CONCLUSIONS: Preschool children are more susceptible to M. pneumoniae infection and close contact appears to be the predominant factor favoring pathogen transmission. The public health response to COVID-19 can effectively control the transmission of M. pneumoniae.","Zhang, Ying; Huang, Yijie; Ai, Tao; Luo, Jun; Liu, Hanmin",BMC Pediatr,,273

235946,The ethical dilemma of ventilator sharing during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Complex systems which can be represented in the form of static and dynamic graphs arise in different fields, e.g. communication, engineering and industry. One of the interesting problems in analysing dynamic network structures is to monitor changes in their development. Statistical learning, which encompasses both methods based on artificial intelligence and traditional statistics, can be used to progress in this research area. However, the majority of approaches apply only one or the other framework. In this paper, we discuss the possibility of bringing together both disciplines in order to create enhanced network monitoring procedures focussing on the example of combining statistical process control and deep learning algorithms. Together with the presentation of change point and anomaly detection in network data, we propose to monitor the response times of ambulance services, applying jointly the control chart for quantile function values and a graph convolutional network.","Malinovskaya, Anna; Otto, Philipp; Peters, Torben",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.06080v1.pdf,273

DESIGN: Rasch analysis of ICARE Phase III trial data, comparing three upper extremity (UE) motor treatments in stroke survivors enrolled 45.8±22.4 days post-stroke. Participants underwent a structured UE motor training called Accelerated Skill Acquisition Program, usual and customary care, or dose-equivalent care. UEFM data from Baseline, post-intervention, 6, and 12 months were included for analysis. SETTING: Outpatient stroke rehabilitation. PARTICIPANTS: ICARE participants. INTERVENTIONS: N/A MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Item difficulties, person abilities, sample size. RESULTS: Summed raw UEFM scores, because of their ordinality, measured motor impairment inconsistently across different ranges of stroke severity relative to the rescaled UEFM. In the full ICARE sample (N=361), raw UEFM understated scores relative to rescaled by 7.4 points for the most severely impaired, but overstated scores by up to 8.4 points towards the ceiling. As a result, 50.9% of all UEFM observations showed a residual error greater than 10% of the total UEFM score. Relative to the raw, the rescaled UEFM improved effect size of change in motor impairment between baseline and 1-year (d=0.35). For a hypothetical three-arm trial resembling ICARE, UEFM rescaling reduced required sample size by 32% (n = 108) compared to raw UEFM (n= 159). CONCLUSIONS: In UE rehabilitation trials, a rescaled UEFM potentially decreases sample size by 1/3, decreasing costs, duration, and subjects exposed to experimental risks. This benefit is obtained through increased measurement efficiency; reductions in ceiling effects are also possible. These findings apply to ICARE-like trials; confirmatory validation in another Phase III trial is needed.","Geed, Shashwati; Lane, Christianne J; Nelsen, Monica A; Wolf, Steven L; Winstein, Carolee J; Dromerick, Alexander W",Arch. phys. med. rehabil,,273

Therefore, the aim of this study was to reveal the dynamics of renal involvement superimposed COVID-19 according to time and space. METHODS: COVID-19 patients reporting renal involvement were included in this study. The following information was collected from relevant articles: first author, patient demographics, patient enrollment period, location, definition of acute kidney injury (AKI), prevalence of AKI, and use of renal replacement therapy (RRT). RESULTS: A total of 17 134 patients were finally included. The overall prevalence of AKI in COVID-19 patients was 19%, with 7% of them undergoing RRT. The overall risk of AKI in patients enrolled before March 1, 2020 (9%) was significantly lower than that after March 1, 2020 (36%) (P < 0.00001). Moreover, the overall risk of AKI outside Asia (35%) was significantly higher than that in Asia (10%) (P < 0.00001). Additionally, similar to patients requiring RRT, AKI patients were more likely to become seriously ill or even to die (P < 0.00001). CONCLUSIONS: This study found that renal involvement superimposed COVID-19, a comorbidity portending a poor prognosis, has become an increasingly serious problem over time and is more common outside Asia. Thus, more attention should be paid to the management of this specific group of patients.","Feng, Yi-Fu; Wang, Kun-Peng; Mo, Jing-Gang; Xu, Ying-He; Wang, Lie-Zhi; Jin, Chong; Chen, Xiang; Yi, Bin",Int J Infect Dis,,273
237339,Mothers as Home DJs: Recorded Music and Young Children's Well-Being During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization. As of May 18, 2020, there have been more than 4.7 million cases and over 316,000 deaths worldwide. COVID-19 is caused by a highly infectious novel coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), leading to an acute infectious disease with mild-to-severe clinical symptoms such as flu-like symptoms, fever, headache, dry cough, muscle pain, loss of smell and taste, increased shortness of breath, bilateral viral pneumonia, conjunctivitis, acute respiratory distress syndromes, respiratory failure, cytokine release syndrome (CRS), sepsis, etc. While physicians and scientists have yet to discover a treatment, it is imperative that we urgently address 2 questions: how to prevent infection in immunologically naive individuals and how to treat severe symptoms such as CRS, acute respiratory failure, and the loss of somatosensation. Previous studies from the 1918 influenza pandemic have suggested vitamin D's non-classical role in reducing lethal pneumonia and case fatality rates. Recent clinical trials also reported that vitamin D supplementation can reduce incidence of acute respiratory infection and the severity of respiratory tract diseases in adults and children. According to our literature search, there are no similar findings of clinical trials that have been published as of July 1st, 2020, in relation to the supplementation of vitamin D in the potential prevention and treatment for COVID-19. In this review, we summarize the potential role of vitamin D extra-renal metabolism in the prevention and treatment of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, helping to bring us slightly closer to fulfilling that goal. We will focus on 3 major topics here: 1. Vitamin D might aid in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection: Vitamin D: Overview of Renal and Extra-renal metabolism and regulation. Vitamin D: Overview of molecular mechanism and multifaceted functions beyond skeletal homeostasis. Vitamin D: Overview of local immunomodulation in human infectious diseases. Anti-viral infection. Anti-malaria and anti-systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). 2. Vitamin D might act as a strong immunosuppressant inhibiting cytokine release syndrome in COVID-19: Vitamin D: Suppression of key pro-inflammatory pathways including nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). 3. Vitamin D might prevent loss of neural sensation in COVID-19 by stimulating expression of neurotrophins like Nerve Growth Factor (NGF): Vitamin D: Induction of key neurotrophic factors. .","Xu, Yi; Baylink, David J; Chen, Chien-Shing; Reeves, Mark E; Xiao, Jeffrey; Lacy, Curtis; Lau, Eric; Cao, Huynh",J Transl Med,,273

Softwoods have a significant economic value for timber production and the Pinus genus is widely utilized. Thus, the aim of this work was to study the hemicellulose extraction and lignin recovery from pine (Pinus spp.) residual sawdust (PRS) by sequential acid-alkaline treatment, generating a cellulose-rich solid fraction. The hemicellulose removed was 87.11% (wt·wt-1) after dilute acid treatment at 130 °C, 4.5% (wt·wt-1) of H2SO4 for 20 min at 120 rpm. Three temperatures were evaluated for recovering the lignin and the highest yield, 93.97% (wt·wt-1), was achieved at 170 °C, 10% (wt·wt-1) of NaOH for 90 min at 120 rpm. Lignin was characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance and thermogravimetry. The resulting cellulose-rich fraction exhibited polymorphic transformation. The results demonstrated that PRS is a promising lignocellulosic residue whose lignin and carbohydrates can be readily obtained.","Cavali, Matheus; Soccol, Carlos Ricardo; Tavares, Débora; Zevallos Torres, Luis Alberto; Oliveira de Andrade Tanobe, Valcineide; Zandoná Filho, Arion; Woiciechowski, Adenise Lorenci",Bioresour Technol,,273
239093,Using behavioural theory to understand adherence to behaviours that reduce transmission of COVID-19; evidence from the CHARIS representative national study,2021,"BACKGROUND: Exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is associated with various adverse health outcomes. Although several mechanisms have been proposed including oxidative stress and inflammatory responses, the exact mechanism is still unknown. Few studies have investigated the mechanism linking PM2.5 and blood pressure (BP). In this study, we measured urinary metabolites and BP -related renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) to investigate the associations between ambient PM2.5 exposure and BP in healthy C57BL/6 mice. METHODS: The C57BL/6 mice were exposed to ambient concentrated PM2.5 or filtered air (FA) for 16 weeks. Systolic BP and diastolic BP were measured by noninvasive BP system. The urine metabolites were quantified using the untargeted metabolomics approach. The expression of RAAS-related proteins angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)2, angiotensin (Ang) II, Ang (1-7) and aldosterone (ALD) were measured using Western blot and ELISA kits. RESULTS: The metabolomics analysis demonstrated that PM2.5 exposure induced significant changes of some metabolites in urine, including stress hormones, amino acids, fatty acids, and lipids. Furthermore, there was an elevation of BP, increase of serous Ang II and ALD, along with the decrease of ACE2 and Ang (1-7) in kidney in the PM2.5-exposed mice compared with FA-exposed mice. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that PM2.5 exposure-induced BP elevation might be associated with RAAS activation. Meanwhile, PM2.5 exposure-induced changes of stress hormone and lipid metabolism might mediate the activation of RAAS. The results suggested that the systemic stress hormone and lipid metabolism was associated with the development of hypertension.","Du, Xihao; Zeng, Xuejiao; Zhang, Jia; Pan, Kun; Song, Liying; Zhou, Ji; Zhou, Li; Xie, Yuquan; Sun, Qinghua; Ge, Wenzhen; Chen, Renjie; Zhao, Jinzhuo; Kan, Haidong",Ecotoxicol Environ Saf,,273

We, therefore, aimed to evaluate recruitment rates, data collection, and group exercises conducted through virtual technology among individuals aged 60 years and over in Malaysia. Participants were recruited from the Promoting Independence in Seniors with Arthritis (PISA) pilot cohort through social media messaging. A four-week course of virtual group exercise was offered. Anxiety and depression were assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) during the last attended follow-up of the cohort study (pre-pandemic), pre-intervention, and post-intervention. Exercise adherence was recorded using diaries with daily entries and attendance to the virtual group exercise sessions were also captured electronically daily. The outcomes of interest were changes in anxiety and depression scores from baseline to pre-intervention (pandemic-related) and post-intervention (virtual exercise related). Forty-three individuals were recruited. A significant increase in anxiety scores from baseline to pre-intervention was observed. Comparisons using repeated-measures analysis of variance between those who attendance &#8805;14 and <14 group exercise sessions revealed no between-within subject differences in depression scores. There was a 23% dropout rate in the post intervention survey and 60.5% of diaries were returned.

Defining research and investment opportunities and priorities,2021,"South Korea was among the first countries to report a case of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). As of August 14, 2020, South Korea reported 14 873 confirmed cases and 305 deaths from COVID-19. We collected the number of laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths by age from the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We estimated population-level death rates by fitting a logistic regression model using Firth's bias reduction method. We calculated the age-standardized death rate (ASDR) varying the COVID-19 prevalence and level of death undercount. Estimated population-level death rates of COVID-19 (deaths per 100 000 person-years) increased with age: 0.1 among 30 to 39 year olds, 1.1 among 60 to 69 year olds, and 14.5 among &#8805;80 year olds. The ASDR (deaths per 100 000 person-years) was 0.9 based on the current deaths and population-level prevalence of 0.03%. If the prevalence increased to 0.6% and 30% of COVID-19 deaths had not been reported, the ASDR would further increase to 13.7 to become the seventh leading cause of death. Currently, the population-level mortality burden of COVID-19 in South Korea, as measured by the ASDR, was relatively low compared with other causes but could increase substantially if the prevalence increases from another outbreak or COVID-19 deaths were undercounted.","Soneji, Samir; Beltrán-Sánchez, Hiram; Yang, JaeWon; Mann, Caroline",Asia Pac J Public Health,,273

242834,More Than Inconvenienced: The Unique Needs of U.S. College Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Background: Gene therapy is considered a novel way to treat osteosarcoma, and microRNAs are potential therapeutic targets for osteosarcoma. miR-214 has been found to promote osteosarcoma aggression and metastasis. Graphene oxide (GO) is widely used for gene delivery for the distinct physiochemical properties and minimal cytotoxicity. Methods: Polyethyleneimine (PEI)-functionalized GO complex was well-prepared and loaded with miR-214 inhibitor at different concentrations. The load efficacy was tested by gel retardation assay and the cy3-labeled fluorescence of cellular uptake. The experiments of wound healing, immunofluorescence staining, Western blot, qRT-PCR and immunohistochemical staining were performed to measure the inhibitory effect of the miR-214 inhibitor systematically released from the complexes against MG63, U2OS cells and xenograft tumors. Results: The systematic mechanistic elucidation of the efficient delivery of the miR-214 inhibitor by GO-PEI indicated that the inhibition of cellular miR-214 caused a decrease in osteosarcoma cell invasion and migration and an increase in apoptosis by targeting phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). The synergistic combination of the GO-PEI-miR-214 inhibitor and CDDP chemotherapy showed significant cell death. In a xenograft mouse model, the GO-PEI-miR-214 inhibitor significantly inhibited tumor volume growth. Conclusion: This study indicates the potential of functionalized GO-PEI as a vehicle for miRNA inhibitor delivery to treat osteosarcoma with low toxicity and miR-214 can be a good target for osteosarcoma therapy.","Ou, Lingling; Lin, Haiyingjie; Song, Yuwei; Tan, Guoqiang; Gui, Xiujuan; Li, Jinyuan; Chen, Xiaoting; Deng, Zhendong; Lin, Shaoqiang",Int J Nanomedicine,,273

248834,Exploring the Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Economic Activities and Well-being of Older Adults in South-eastern Nigeria: Lessons for Gerontological Social Workers,2021,"Rationale: The novel coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has presented major challenges for global health systems. Given limited availability of diagnostic testing and delays in test results during the first wave of the pandemic, our hospital used computed tomography (CT) to risk stratify patients with suspected COVID-19. The aim of this study was to describe the various patterns of disease on chest CT and relate them to chest x-ray (CXR) findings. Methods: This is a retrospective review of 559 symptomatic patients infected with COVID-19 (diagnosed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) admitted from March 2020 to May 2020 at Temple University Hospital (Philadelphia, PA) who received admission CXR and chest CT scans that were performed within 24 hours of admission. Scans were independently reviewed by a group of radiologists. CXRs was interpreted as “consistent with COVID-19” if there were lower lobe peripheral opacities. Chest CTs were evaluated for the presence of ground glass opacities, consolidations, interlobular septal thickening, centrilobular nodules, and crazy paving pattern. Chest CT was also assessed for background lung disease (emphysema, interstitial lung disease). Results: Of the 559 patients, median age was 58 years old, 55.5% were female, and 56.7% were African American. Median BMI was 31.61. Median duration of symptoms at time of chest imaging was 5 days. 153 (27.4%) of patient's admission CXR was not consistent with COVID-19. Of those, 124 (81%) had abnormalities on chest CT. Median number of lobes involved with disease on CT was 3.8 and 317 patients (56.7%) had all 5 lobes with disease. The most common abnormalities found were ground glass opacities (n=507, 90.7%), consolidations (n=224, 40%) and centrilobular nodules (n=127, 22.7%). Less common findings included pleural effusion (n=62, 11.8%), lymphadenopathy (n=55, 9.8%), pericardial effusion (n=24, 4.2%), and pneumothorax (n=3, 0.53%). Of note, 82 (14.7%) patients were found to have emphysema, and 2 (0.35%) were found to have interstitial lung disease. Conclusion: We present one of the largest reviews of CT scans in patients admitted for COVID-19. The majority of our population had significant burden of disease on CT at time of presentation. Ground glass opacities and consolidations were the predominant findings. Most patients did not have background emphysema or interstitial lung disease. The fact that many patients with normal CXR had abnormalities on chest CT highlights the utility of chest CT in evaluating patients with COVID-19.","Zheng, M.; Patel, R.; Leopold, I.; Thomas, A.; Standiford, T.; Townsend, R.; Rali, P.; Gupta, R.; Criner, G.

METHODS: This is an observational single-center study in which we collected clinical and surgical data during (P1) and after (P2) the COVID-19 outbreak and the lockdown measures implemented in Northern Italy. We compared those data with the two-month period before the pandemic (P0). RESULTS: Compared to P0, ambulatory activities were severely reduced during P1 and limited to hospitalized patients and outpatients with urgent criteria. We performed 61 operations (18 urgent and 43 elective), with a decrease in both aortic (-17.8%), cerebrovascular (-53.3%), and peripheral artery (-42.6%) disease treatments. We also observed a greater drop in open procedures (-53.2%) than in endovascular ones (-22%). All the elective patients were treated for notdeferrable conditions and they were COVID-19 negative at the ward admission screening; despite this one of them developed COVID19 during the hospital stay. Four COVID-19 positive patients were treated in urgent setting for acute limb ischemia. Throughout P2 we gradually rescheduled elective ambulatory (+155.5%) and surgical (+18%) activities, while remaining substantially lower than during P0 (respectively -45.6% and -25.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Despite COVID-19 pandemic, our experience shows that with careful patient's selection, dedicated prehospitalization protocol and proper use of personal protective equipment it is possible to guarantee continuity of care.","Boschetti, Gian Antonio; Di Gregorio, Sara; Mena Vera, Jorge Miguel; Pane, Bianca; Spinella, Giovanni; Palombo, Domenico; Pratesi, Giovanni",Ann. vasc. surg,,273

CONCLUSIONS: Disasters such as the COVID-19 pandemic are often characterized by chaos and uncertainty. As a result, public health disaster planning and response represent formidable challenges. Although disasters can result from a wide array of hazards, regardless of the agent at work, they may follow a rather predictable trajectory of psychological phases. A heuristic of those phases can provide an opportunity for a more organized disaster mental health response and more efficient utilization of scarce resources.","Everly, George S; Wu, Albert W; Potash, James B",Am J Disaster Med,,273

253098,Burdening the poor: Extreme responses to COVID-19 in India and the Southeastern United States,2020,"As the COVID-19 pandemic has ravaged the United States, health care teams are on the frontlines of this global crisis, often navigating harrowing conditions at work, such as a lack of personal protective equipment and staffing shortages, and distractions at home, including worries about elderly relatives or making childcare arrangements. While the nature and severity of stressors impacting health care teams are in many ways unprecedented, decades of psychological research exploring teamwork in extreme contexts can provide insights to understand and improve outcomes for teams in a crisis. This review highlights the psychological principles that apply to teams in a crisis and illustrates how psychologists can use this knowledge to improve teamwork for medical teams in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic., The review also provides a glimpse toward the future, noting both how psychologists can help health care teams recover and rebound, as well as how additional research can improve psychologists' understanding of teamwork in times of crisis.

This case report depicts an unexpected intraoperative coagulopathy during a cesarean section in an otherwise asymptomatic patient who was later found to have COVID-19. This case suggests that there may be a higher risk for intrapartum bleeding in the pregnant, largely asymptomatic COVID-positive patient with more abnormal COVID laboratory values. CASE: The case patient displayed D-Dimer elevations beyond what is typically observed among this hospital's COVID-positive peripartum population and displayed significantly more oozing than expected intraoperatively, despite normal prothrombin time, international normalized ratio, fibrinogen, and platelets. CONCLUSION: There is little published evidence on the association between D-Dimer and coagulopathy among the pregnant population infected with SARS-CoV-2. This case report contributes to the growing body of evidence on the effects of COVID-19 in pregnancy. A clinical picture concerning for intraoperative coagulopathy may be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection during cesarean sections, and abnormal COVID laboratory tests, particularly D-Dimer, may help identify the patients in which this presentation occurs.","Kinsey, Kelly Elizabeth; Ganz, Eric; Khalil, Susan; Brustman, Lois",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,,273
254653,Holistic approach during a pandemic for healthy well-being,2020,"Heterogeneous teams of robots, leveraging a balance between autonomy and human interaction, bring powerful capabilities to the problem of exploring dangerous, unstructured subterranean environments. Here we describe the solution developed by Team CSIRO Data61, consisting of CSIRO, Emesent and Georgia Tech, during the DARPA Subterranean Challenge. These presented systems were fielded in the Tunnel Circuit in August 2019, the Urban Circuit in February 2020, and in our own Cave event, conducted in September 2020. A unique capability of the fielded team is the homogeneous sensing of the platforms utilised, which is leveraged to obtain a decentralised multi-agent SLAM solution on each platform (both ground agents and UAVs) using peer-to-peer communications. This enabled a shift in focus from constructing a pervasive communications network to relying on multi-agent autonomy, motivated by experiences in early circuit events. These experiences also showed the surprising capability of rugged tracked platforms for challenging terrain, which in turn led to the heterogeneous team structure based on a BIA5 OzBot Titan ground robot and an Emesent Hovermap UAV, supplemented by smaller tracked or legged ground robots. The ground agents use a common CatPack perception module, which allowed reuse of the perception and autonomy stack across all ground agents with minimal adaptation.","Hudson, Nicolas; Talbot, Fletcher; Cox, Mark; Williams, Jason; Hines, Thomas; Pitt, Alex; Wood, Brett; Frousheger, Dennis; Surdo, Katrina Lo; Molnar, Thomas; Steindl, Ryan; Wildie, Matt; Sa, Inkyu; Kottege, Navinda; Stepanas, Kazys; Hernandez, Emili; Catt, Gavin; Docherty, William; Tidd, Brendan; Tam, Benjamin; Murrell, Simon; Bessell, Mitchell; Hanson, Lauren; Tychsen-Smith, Lachlan; Suzuki, Hajime; Overs, Leslie; Kendoul, Farid; Wagner, Glenn; Palmer, Duncan; Milani, Peter; O'Brien, Matthew; Jiang, Shu; Chen, Shengkang; Arkin, Ronald C.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.09053v1.pdf,273

Articles were chosen based on relevance to the current topic and ability to provide unique thematic information. Historical articles were included if these added scientific merit to recent literature. Review of information in widely disseminated news articles was followed-up with direct review of cited scientific literature. Databases searched included Google Scholar, PubMed, and Ovid Medline. RESULTS: Based on neuroinvasive properties of prior coronaviruses and existing research on similar neurophysiological conditions with detrimental cognitive effects, COVID-19-especially those with severe symptoms-are at risk for cognitive decline and significant psychiatric/behavioral sequela. CONCLUSIONS: There are few studies examining cognitive outcomes in COVID-19. This review argues that neuropsychological sequelae are to be expected in patients with COVID-19.

255497,Revisiting e-education platforms for nontechnical courses to aid online teaching during pandemic times in India,2021,"There have been concerns regarding the safety of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in patients with respiratory infections. However, to date, the quality of the evidence has not been systematically assessed. The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the role of NSAIDs on pneumonia complications. OVID MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, and Google Scholar were searched. Studies that examined pneumonia complications in patients who had taken NSAIDs before onset of symptoms were identified. Quality assessment was conducted using the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies - of Interventions (ROBINS-I) assessment tool, which was adapted to include biases that were pertinent to this question. The search strategy identified 1721 potential studies through the 5 primary databases and searching reference lists. Of these, 10 studies met the inclusion criteria, including 5 nested case-control studies, 2 population-based case-control studies, and 3 cohort studies. In total, 59,724 adults were included from 4 of the studies (range = 57-59,250) and 1217 children from 5 studies (range = 148-540). All studies demonstrated a positive association; in adults (odds ratio/risk ratio range = 1.8-8.1) and children (odds ratio/risk ratio range = 1.9-6.8). Studies were limited by moderate or serious risk of confounding bias, exposure misclassification, and protopathic biases and sparse data bias. The results of this review demonstrate that published studies on the effect of NSAIDs use and risk of pneumonia complications are subject to a number of biases. These results should not be extrapolated as evidence of harm for NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, in respiratory ailments but highlight the need for more methodologically robust studies to evaluate this potential relationship.","Sodhi, Mohit; Khosrow-Khavar, Farzin; FitzGerald, John Mark; Etminan, Mahyar",Pharmacotherapy,,273

We obtained blood samples (n = 474) from hospitalized COVID-19 patients (n = 123), non-COVID-19 ICU sepsis patients (n = 25) and healthy controls (n = 30). Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was detected in plasma or serum (RNAemia) of COVID-19 ICU patients when neutralizing antibody response was low. RNAemia is associated with higher 28-day ICU mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.84 [95% CI, 1.22-2.77] adjusted for age and sex). RNAemia is comparable in performance to the best protein predictors. Mannose binding lectin 2 and pentraxin-3 (PTX3), two activators of the complement pathway of the innate immune system, are positively associated with mortality. Machine learning identified 'Age, RNAemia' and 'Age, PTX3' as the best binary signatures associated with 28-day ICU mortality. In longitudinal comparisons, COVID-19 ICU patients have a distinct proteomic trajectory associated with mortality, with recovery of many liver-derived proteins indicating survival. Finally, proteins of the complement system and galectin-3-binding protein (LGALS3BP) are identified as interaction partners of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. LGALS3BP overexpression inhibits spike-pseudoparticle uptake and spike-induced cell-cell fusion in vitro.","Gutmann, Clemens; Takov, Kaloyan; Burnap, Sean A; Singh, Bhawana; Ali, Hashim; Theofilatos, Konstantinos; Reed, Ella; Hasman, Maria; Nabeebaccus, Adam; Fish, Matthew; McPhail, Mark Jw; O039,; Gallagher, Kevin; Schmidt, Lukas E; Cassel, Christian; Rienks, Marieke; Yin, Xiaoke; Auzinger, Georg; Napoli, Salvatore; Mujib, Salma F; Trovato, Francesca; Sanderson, Barnaby; Merrick, Blair; Niazi, Umar; Saqi, Mansoor; Dimitrakopoulou, Konstantina; Fernández-Leiro, Rafael; Braun, Silke; Kronstein-Wiedemann, Romy; Doores, Katie J; Edgeworth, Jonathan D; Shah, Ajay M; Bornstein, Stefan R; Tonn, Torsten; Hayday, Adrian C; Giacca, Mauro; Shankar-Hari, Manu; Mayr, Manuel",Nat Commun,,273

We seek to determine the impact of SARS-CoV-2 related public health interventions on emergency healthcare utilization and frequency of critical illness in children. Methods: This was an interrupted time series analysis conducted at a single tertiary pediatric emergency department (PED). All patients evaluated by a provider from December 31 through May 14 of 6 consecutive years (2015-2020) were included. Total patient visits (ED and urgent care), shock trauma suite (STS) volume, and measures of critical illness were compared between the SARS-CoV-2 period (December 31, 2019 to May 14, 2020) and the same period for the previous 5 years combined. A segmented regression model was used to explore differences in the 3 outcomes between the study and control period. Results: Total visits, STS volume, and volume of critical illness were all significantly lower during the SARS-CoV-2 period. During the height of public health interventions, per day there were 151 fewer total visits and 7 fewer patients evaluated in the STS. The odds of having a 24-hour period without a single critical patient were >5 times higher. Trends appeared to start before the statewide shelter-in-place order and lasted for at least 8 weeks.

METHODS: An ad hoc web-based survey of EAES members and affiliates was developed by the EAES Research Committee. The questionnaire consisted of 69 items divided into the following sections: (&#921;) demographics, (II) institutional burdens and management strategies, and (III) analysis of resource, knowledge, and evidence gaps. Descriptive statistics were summarized as frequencies, medians, ranges,, and interquartile ranges, as appropriate. RESULTS: The survey took place between March 25th and April 16th with a total of 550 surgeons from 79 countries. Eighty-one percent had to postpone elective cases or suspend their practice and 35% assumed roles not related to their primary expertise. One-fourth of respondents reported having encountered abdominal pathologies in COVID-19-positive patients, most frequently acute appendicitis (47% of respondents). The effect of protective measures in surgical or endoscopic procedures on infected patients, the effect of endoscopic surgery on infected patients, and the infectivity of positive patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery were prioritized as knowledge gaps and research priorities.

The models are chosen by considering their fitness with the data of Taiwan which is believed to have passed over the peak of the pandemic and have gone through all phases in the growth curves. The models are parameterized using the nonlinear least squares method. The deviation and confidence interval of each parameter is estimated using the k-fold cross-validation and the bootstrap techniques. Using the total cases per million population data from March 2 to June 18, 2020, it was found that two growth models fit the data, i.e. logistic and modified Gompertz, where the latter performs better. Using the information about the deviation of each model parameter, a simulation model is developed to predict the time at which the total cases curve starts to flatten, which is an indication of the end of the pandemic. It was found with 95% confidence level that based on the modified Gompertz model the pandemic will end somewhere between March 9 – September 7, 2021 with total cases per million of 206 - 555. Meanwhile, based on the logistic growth model, the end of the pandemic is between August 28 – September 23, 2020 with total cases per million of 180 - 375. This model can be extended by making comparative scenario with Taiwan based on measures that represent the quality of the pandemic mitigation such as test ratio and the intensity of social restriction.","Pratikto, Fransiscus Rian",Jurnal Rekayasa Sistem Industri,,273

264559,How Does Digital Competence Preserve University Students' Psychological Well-Being During the Pandemic? An Investigation From Self-Determined Theory,2021,"Aims/Objectives/Background Self-harm among adolescents is a major concern both because it gives rise to considerable distress and disruption in young people's lives and it commonly recurs There are currently wide variations in the care of this group of patients and it is widely reported that their experience in the emergency department is poor Young people who have self-harmed may differ from others attending the ED and we need to know more about these differences to inform ED care and potential improvements The aim of this study was to establish the needs and expectations among children and young people in the ED and to increase the understanding of the specific needs of adolescents who self-harm through comparison with another patient group in the ED Methods/Design We undertook a case-control study with adolescents attending for suspected fractures serving as the control group Adolescents and their guardians were each given a questionnaire pack on arrival in ED, and again at least 2 hours later, thus capturing their expectations and pre-existing characteristics, and their experience Trained research assistants were present in the ED seven days a week and covered 10 am till 10 pm The study commenced in July 2019 and terminated early in March 2020 at the onset of the COVID 19 pandemic Results/Conclusions Young people who had self-harmed had significantly higher mean dissatisfaction scores than those with suspected fractures They also had higher mean levels of emotional and interpersonal difficulties and these were associated with higher dissatisfaction scores This is the first case-control study to show that dissatisfaction with the ED is at least partly a function of the particular mental health problems suffered by adolescents who self-harm This in turn provides initial clues to the particular needs of this group of patients in whom the current management is widely reported as inadequate","Keating, L.; Wilson, S.; Hill, J.; Dainty, J.",Emergency Medicine Journal,,273

Moreover, epidemics caused by viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 occur during the winter months. The mechanisms underlying the seasonal nature of respiratory viral infections have been examined and debated for many years. The two major contributing factors are the changes in environmental parameters and human behavior. Studies have revealed the effect of temperature and humidity on respiratory virus stability and transmission rates. More recent research highlights the importance of the environmental factors, especially temperature and humidity, in modulating host intrinsic, innate, and adaptive immune responses to viral infections in the respiratory tract. Here we review evidence of how outdoor and indoor climates are linked to the seasonality of viral respiratory infections. We further discuss determinants of host response in the seasonality of respiratory viruses by highlighting recent studies in the field.

268446,Positives to be found in COVID response,2020,"Background: The outbreak of COVID-19 has caused extremely many serious consequences for the country and the world. In fact, it has seriously affected people's mental health. The purpose of this study is to understand the psychological stress among college students in different stages of epidemics in hard-hit areas such as Hubei. Moreover, to highlight the factors that influencing, their psychological conditions with the emphasis of further corresponding suggestions. Methods: This study includes self-designed questionnaires in order to assess and analyze the psychological state of over 17,000 college students during the outbreak period in January and home quarantine in February. The questionnaire contains three aspects and six dimensions: pressure responses: stress susceptibility (SS), stress adjustment (SA), risk cognition: cognition of danger (CD), cognition of illness (CI) and stress reactions: emotional responses (ER), somatic responses (SR). This survey was done by an online questionnaire (www.wjx.cn) to investigate the psychological stress information of college students, and analyzed the data by SPSS 22.0 for Windows. Results: Regarding the stress susceptibility, participants were more likely stressed in February than in January. Regarding the stress adjustment, the number of participants requiring pressure regulation or release in the February survey was significantly lower than that the effective in the January survey. The mean of the cognition of danger reduced significantly in February than in January, in other words, participants were highly worried about the epidemic in January than in February. Regarding the cognition of illness, participants in January had a more pessimistic attitude towards the epidemic than those in February. The emotional responses of the participants in February were more severe than those in January, while the somatic responses reduced significantly in February compared with January. Furthermore, females have stronger stress reactions than males. However, the SR doesn't have significant differences between females and males. Conclusion: After two surveys in January and February, it was found that the psychological stress of college students in Hubei were significantly different at different stages of the epidemic, where the epidemic developped, the psychological stress of college students become more severe. The psychological stress of the college students in Hubei Province, as a severely affected area, should be paid more attention.","Zhang, Yan; Cao, Xiaochen; Xie, Yufei; Zhong, Qiongyao; Lei, Guanghui; Zhang, Jingyuan; Xiao, Qiang; Wang, Guixiang; Bian, Yueran; Xie, Simiao; Huang, Fei",Child Youth Serv Rev,,273

We previously generated the stable and ultrapotent homotrimeric Pittsburgh inhalable Nanobody 21 (PiN-21). Using Syrian hamsters that model moderate to severe COVID-19 disease, we demonstrate the high efficacy of PiN-21 to prevent and treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. Intranasal delivery of PiN-21 at 0.6 mg/kg protects infected animals from weight loss and substantially reduces viral burdens in both lower and upper airways compared to control. Aerosol delivery of PiN-21 facilitates deposition throughout the respiratory tract and dose minimization to 0.2 mg/kg. Inhalation treatment quickly reverses animals' weight loss after infection, decreases lung viral titers by 6 logs leading to drastically mitigated lung pathology, and prevents viral pneumonia. Combined with the marked stability and low production cost, this innovative therapy may provide a convenient and cost-effective option to mitigate the ongoing pandemic.","Nambulli, Sham; Xiang, Yufei; Tilston-Lunel, Natasha L; Rennick, Linda J; Sang, Zhe; Klimstra, William B; Reed, Douglas S; Crossland, Nicholas A; Shi, Yi; Duprex, W Paul",Sci.

275204,Progression of COVID-19 From Urban to Rural Areas in the United States: A Spatiotemporal Analysis of Prevalence Rates,2020,"This paper argues for reconceptualising an educational curriculum that locates its primacy in practices. The argument is framed around the core purpose of education: to help people ‘live well in a world worth living in’. Living well and learning about what this means is typically guided by epistemologically based curricula, and conversely, school curricula determine the substance of education. We argue that this understanding of education is too narrow, and as a consequence, it severs the relationship between knowing and practising. We propose that a curriculum of mathematical practices is required for human flourishing, where the focus is on mathematical practices rather than predominantly on knowledge. To demonstrate our position, we consider different kinds of mathematical practices needed during the Covid-19 crisis. We examine how a practice-approach forms the basis for a future-oriented curriculum which might better equip individuals and societies to respond to conditions which disrupt their everyday circumstances.

Patients presented 5 to 11 days after first vaccination. The spectrum of clinical manifestations included cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT), arterial cerebral thromboembolism, and thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). All patients had thrombocytopenia and markedly elevated D-Dimer. Autoantibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4) were detected in all patients although they had never been exposed to heparin. Immunoglobulin from patient sera bound to healthy donor platelets in an AZD1222-dependant manner, suppressed by heparin. Aggregation of healthy donor platelets by patient sera was demonstrated in the presence of buffer or AZD1222 and was also suppressed by heparin. Anticoagulation alone or in combination with eculizumab or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) resolved the pathology in three patients. Two patients had thromboembolic events despite anticoagulation at a time when platelets were increasing after IVIG. In summary, an unexpected autoimmune prothrombotic disorder is described after vaccination with AZD1222. It is characterized by thrombocytopenia and anti-PF4 antibodies binding to platelets in AZD1222-dependent manner. Initial clinical experience suggests a risk of unusual and severe thromboembolic events.","Tiede, Andreas; Sachs, Ulrich J; Czwalinna, Andreas; Werwitzke, Sonja; Bikker, Rolf; Krauss, Joachim K; Donnerstag, Frank Gf; Weißenborn, Karin; Höglinger, Günter U; Maasoumy, Benjamin; Wedemeyer, Heiner; Ganser, Arnold",Blood,,273
275852,Family medicine departments and healthcare centres during COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey,2020,"Inflammation and neovascularization are key pathological events in human age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Activated microglia/macrophages (mi/ma) and retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) play an active role in every stage of disease progression. Systemic therapies that can target these cells and address both inflammation and neovascularization will broaden the impact of existing therapies and potentially open new avenues for early AMD where there are no viable therapies. Utilizing a clinically relevant rat model of AMD that mirrors many aspects that of human AMD pathological events, we show that systemic hydroxyl-terminated polyamidoamine dendrimer-triamcinolone acetonide conjugate (D-TA) is selectively taken up by the injured mi/ma and RPE (without the need for targeting ligands). D-TA suppresses choroidal neovascularization significantly (by >80%, >50-fold better than free drug), attenuates inflammation in the choroid and retina, by limiting macrophage infiltration in the pathological area, significantly suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokines and pro-angiogenic factors, with minimal side effects to healthy ocular tissue and other organs. In ex vivo studies on human postmortem diabetic eyes, the dendrimer is also taken up into choroidal macrophages. These results suggest that the systemic hydroxyl dendrimer-drugs can offer new avenues for therapies in treating early/dry AMD and late/neovascular AMD alone, or in combination with current anti-VEGF therapies. This hydroxyl dendrimer platform but conjugated to a different drug is undergoing clinical trials for severe COVID-19, potentially paving the way for faster clinical translation of similar compounds for ocular and retinal disorders.","Kambhampati, Siva P; Bhutto, Imran A; Wu, Tony; Ho, Katie; McLeod, D Scott; Lutty, Gerard A; Kannan, Rangaramanujam M",J. control. release,,273

Rapid and innovative advances in digital media offer opportunities for health education, which could result in increased preventive behaviors. This study assessed preventive behaviors against contracting COVID-19 and tested mediation pathways linking four types of digital media consumption (social media, mobile social networking apps [MSNs], online news media, and social live steaming services [SLSSs]) to preventive behaviors, mediated by worry. Results from an online survey (N = 511) revealed that the vast majority (>90 percent) of respondents had very often or always practiced preventive behaviors against contracting COVID-19 such as washing their hands more regularly with soap and water, staying away from crowded places, and wearing face masks out in public. In addition, COVID-19 information seeking through the four types of digital media was a salient parameter that encouraged people to practice preventive behaviors either directly or indirectly. Specifically, seeking COVID-19-related information on MSNs, SLSSs, and online news media was directly associated with preventive behaviors. Whereas COVID-19 information consumption on social media, MSNs, and SLSSs during the infectious disease outbreak could elicit intense worry and, in turn, increase preventive behaviors. The reasons for and implications of the results are discussed.","Liu, Piper Liping",Cyberpsychol Behav Soc Netw,,273

One prominent adaptive mutation is the asparagine-to-glycine substitution at amino acid position 614 in the viral spike protein (D614G), which has become dominant in the currently circulating virus strains. Since spike protein determines host ranges, tissue tropism, and pathogenesis through binding to the cellular receptor of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the D614G mutation is hypothesized to enhance viral fitness in human host, leading to increased transmission during the global pandemic. Here we summarize the recent progress on the role of the D614G mutation in viral replication, pathogenesis, transmission, and vaccine and therapeutic antibody development.

279403,Immigration Status as a Health Care Barrier in the USA during COVID-19,2021,"The morbidity, mortality, and blistering pace of transmission of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to an unprecedented worldwide health crisis. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease produced by SARS-CoV-2 infection, is remarkable for persistent, severe respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation that places considerable strain on critical care resources. Because recovery from COVID-19-associated respiratory failure can be prolonged, tracheostomy may facilitate patient management and optimize the use of mechanical ventilators. Several important considerations apply to plan tracheostomies for COVID-19-infected patients. After performing a literature review of tracheostomies during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreaks, we synthesized important learning points from these experiences and suggested an approach for perioperative teams involved in these procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Multidisciplinary teams should be involved in decisions regarding timing and appropriateness of the procedure. As the theoretical risk of disease transmission is increased during aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs), stringent infectious precautions are warranted. Personal protective equipment (PPE) should be available and worn by all personnel present during tracheostomy. The number of people in the room should be limited to those absolutely necessary. Using the most experienced available operators will minimize the total time that staff is exposed to an infectious aerosolized environment. An approach that secures the airway in the safest and quickest manner will minimize the time any part of the airway is open to the environment. Deep neuromuscular blockade (train-of-four ratio = 0) will facilitate surgical exposure and prevent aerosolization due to patient movement or coughing. For percutaneous tracheostomies, the bronchoscopist should be able to reintubate if needed. Closed-loop communication must occur at all times among members of the team. If possible, after tracheostomy is performed, waiting until the patient is virus-free before changing the cannula or downsizing may reduce the chances of health care worker infection. Tracheostomies in COVID-19 patients present themselves as extremely high risk for all members of the procedural team. To mitigate risk, systematic meticulous planning of each procedural step is warranted along with strict adherence to local/institutional protocols.","Gosling, Andre F; Bose, Somnath; Gomez, Ernest; Parikh, Mihir; Cook, Charles; Sarge, Todd; Shaefi, Shahzad; Leibowitz, Akiva",Anesth Analg,,273

METHODS: The RSVs of the selected keywords related to coronavirus and ocular symptoms between 24 January and 1 June 2020 in the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Germany and Turkey were accessed from GT. The numbers of daily COVID-19 new cases and new deaths in the same time interval in the aforementioned countries were compared with the RSVs of the keywords and terms. RESULTS: The United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Germany, and Turkey were the most affected countries from the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe. In these countries, statistically significant and strong correlations were found between the daily RSVs of most keywords related to coronavirus and ocular symptoms, and the daily numbers of COVID-19 new cases and new deaths ranging from 0.175 to 0.807. CONCLUSIONS: Ocular symptoms are not the frequent signs of COVID-19, but the ocular surface is a possible route for the transmission of COVID-19. The preliminary outcomes of this study demonstrated that there are significant correlations with the ocular symptoms and COVID-19. The news about the relation of eye and COVID-19 in the mass media may have influenced the Google internet search activity of the public for ocular symptoms.","Mirza, Enver; Mirza, Gunsu Deniz; Belviranli, Selman; Oltulu, Refik; Okka, Mehmet",Int Ophthalmol,,273

SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share an otherwise non-conserved part of non-structural protein 3 (Nsp3), therefore named as ""SARS-unique domain"" (SUD). We previously found a yeast-2-hybrid screen interaction of the SARS-CoV SUD with human poly(A)-binding protein (PABP)-interacting protein 1 (Paip1), a stimulator of protein translation. Here, we validate SARS-CoV SUD:Paip1 interaction by size-exclusion chromatography, split-yellow fluorescent protein, and co-immunoprecipitation assays, and confirm such interaction also between the corresponding domain of SARS-CoV-2 and Paip1. The three-dimensional structure of the N-terminal domain of SARS-CoV SUD (""macrodomain II"", Mac2) in complex with the middle domain of Paip1, determined by X-ray crystallography and small-angle X-ray scattering, provides insights into the structural determinants of the complex formation. In cellulo, SUD enhances synthesis of viral but not host proteins via binding to Paip1 in pBAC-SARS-CoV replicon-transfected cells. We propose a possible mechanism for stimulation of viral translation by the SUD of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.","Lei, Jian; Ma-Lauer, Yue; Han, Yinze; Thoms, Matthias; Buschauer, Robert; Jores, Joerg; Thiel, Volker; Beckmann, Roland; Deng, Wen; Leonhardt, Heinrich; Hilgenfeld, Rolf; von Brunn, Albrecht",EMBO J,,273

281448,Reimagining the Role of School‐Based Health Centers During the COVID‐19 Pandemic,2021,"PURPOSE: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, changes to chemotherapy services were implemented as a means of managing imposed workload strains within health services and protecting patients from contracting COVID-19. Given the rapidly evolving nature of the pandemic many changes were rapidly adopted and were not substantiated by robust evidence. This study aimed to describe the changes adopted internationally to chemotherapy services, which may be used to guide future changes to treatment delivery. METHODS: A survey was developed to understand the impact of COVID-19 on the delivery of systemic anti-cancer therapies (SACT). It comprised 22 questions and examined the strategies implemented during the pandemic to prioritise and protect patients receiving SACT and the participants' professional opinion of the strategies employed. The survey was available in English, Spanish and French and was distributed via professional bodies. RESULTS: 129 responses were obtained from healthcare professionals working across 17 different countries. 45% of institutions had to implement treatment prioritisation strategies and all hospitals implemented changes in the delivery of treatment, including: reduction in treatments (69%), using less immunosuppressive agents (50%), allowing treatment breaks (14%) and switching to oral therapies (45%). Virtual clinic visits were perceived by participants as the most effective strategy to protect patients. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic has forced chemotherapy healthcare professionals to adopt new ways of working by reducing health interactions. Many areas of research are needed following this period, including understanding patients' perceptions of risks to treatment, utilisation of oral treatments and the impact of treatment breaks on cancer outcomes.","Chow, Man-Chie; Chambers, Pinkie; Singleton, Georgina; Patel, Jignesh; Cooper, Silvie; Mythen, Charlotte; Bautista-González, Elysse; Chisnall, Georgia; Djellouli, Nehla; Thwaites, Benjamin; Wong, Ian Ck; Vindrola-Padros, Cecilia",J Oncol Pharm Pract,,273

283240,"Disabled people in the time of COVID-19: identifying needs, promoting inclusivity",2021,"In this paper, I explore the mental consequences of Covid‐19. Starting with the images of the pandemic – the intubated patient, the anonymous mass grave, and the death on FaceTime – images that express the horrendous threat of the coronavirus death, I emphasize that the pandemic reminds us of our vulnerability and existential dependence on the other. Based on examples, I discuss different reactions to Covid‐19 from a psychoanalytic perspective, specifically highlighting the mechanisms of denial, splitting and projection – the latter is illustrated in the scapegoating of the pandemic, for example, blaming China, the immigrants or youth parties. I argue that a common characteristic of those different defense mechanisms may be a contempt for weakness – as demonstrated when coronavirus deniers and Proud Boys are marching together. The paper also examines the importance of structure and the consequences of the loss of everyday structure – be it job, school, peer groups, training studios, senior centers, or culture. I conclude by emphasizing that the pandemic has taught us how dependent we are on each other – and that it should inspire us to greater tolerance for vulnerability, and less contempt for weakness.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: this is a collaborative Spanish and European bone marrow transplantation groups retrospective multicentre study, which included allo-HCT recipients (adults and children) with upper and/or lower respiratory tract disease (U/LRTD) caused by seasonal HCoV diagnosed through multiplex PCR assays from January 2012 to January 2019. RESULTS: We included 402 allo-HCT recipients who developed 449 HCoV U/LRTD episodes. Median age of recipients was 46 years (range 0.3-73.8 years). HCoV episodes were diagnosed at a median of 222 days after transplantation. The most common HCoV subtype was OC43 (n=170, 38%). LRTD involvement occurred in 121 episodes (27%). HCoV infection frequently required hospitalization (18%), oxygen administration (13%) and intensive care unit (ICU) admission (3%). Three-month overall mortality after HCoV detection was 7% in the whole cohort and 16% in those with LRTD. We identified 3 conditions associated with higher mortality in recipients with LRTD: absolute lymphocyte count <0.1 x10 9/mL [hazard ratio (HR), 10.8], corticosteroid (HR 4.68) and ICU admission (HR 8.22) (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Seasonal HCoV after allo-HCT may involve the LRTD in many instances, leading to a significant morbidity.","Piñana, Jose Luis; Xhaard, Aliénor; Tridello, Gloria; Passweg, Jakob; Kozijn, Anne; Polverelli, Nicola; Heras, Inmaculada; Perez, Ariadna; Sanz, Jaime; Berghuis, Dagmar; Vázquez, Lourdes; Suárez-Lledó, María; Itäla-Remes, Maija; Ozcelik, Tulay; Iturrate Basarán, Isabel; Karakukcu, Musa; Al Zahrani, Mohsen; Choi, Goda; Cuesta Casas, Marián Angeles; Batlle Massana, Montserrat; Viviana, Amato; Blijlevens, Nicole; Ganser, Arnold; Kuskonmaz, Baris; Labussière-Wallet, Hélène; Shaw, Peter J; Arzu Yegin, Zeynep; González-Vicent, Marta; Rocha, Vanderson; Ferster, Alina; Knelange, Nina; Navarro, David; Mikulska, Malgorzata; de la Camara, Rafael; Styczynski, Jan",J. infect. dis,,273

It was shown that for the countries with strong restrictive measures the spread of COVID-19 fit on a single wave with small capacity as for a number of countries with violation of restrictive measures the spread of the epidemic fit on a waves superposition. For countries with large population mixing, the spread of the epidemic today also fits into a single wave, but with a huge capacity value (for Brazil - 80 million people, for India - 40 million people). We estimated that the epidemic spread in the world today fits into 5 waves. The first two waves are caused by the epidemic spread in China (the first - in Wuhan), the third - by the epidemic spread in European countries, the fourth mainly by the epidemic spread in Russia and the USA, the fifth wave is mainly caused by the epidemic spread in Latin America and South Asia. It was the fifth wave that led to the spread of the coronavirus epidemic COVID-19 entering a new phase, with an increase in the number of infected more than 100 thousand inhabitants. For all the studied countries and the world, for each of the superposition waves, the wave capacities and growth indicators were calculated. The local peaks of the waves and their ending times are determined. It was the fifth wave that led to the fact that COVID-19 spread is entering a new phase, with the increase in the number of infected people being more than 100 thousand inhabitants. For all the countries being examined and for the whole world, for each of the superposition waves we calculated the waves capacities and index of infected people growth.","Koltsova, E.

286286,The Swedish public health response to COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a worldwide crisis caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Many COVID-19 patients present with fever in the early phase, with some progressing to a hyperinflammatory phase. Ethanol (EtOH) exposure may lead to systemic inflammation. Network meta-analysis was conducted to examine possible relationships between EtOH consumption and COVID-19 pathologies. METHODS: Molecules affected by EtOH exposure were identified by analysis with QIAGEN Knowledge Base. Molecules affected by COVID-19 were identified from studies in MEDLINE, bioRxiv, and medRxiv reporting gene expression profiles in COVID-19 patients, QIAGEN Coronavirus Network Explorer, and analysis of the RNA-sequencing data of autopsied lungs of COVID-19 patients retrieved from the GEO database. Network meta-analysis was then conducted on these molecules using QIAGEN Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). RESULTS: Twenty-eight studies reporting significant gene expression changes in COVID-19 patients were identified. One RNA-sequencing dataset on autopsied lungs of COVID-19 patients was retrieved from GEO. Our network meta-analysis suggests that EtOH exposure may augment the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on hepatic fibrosis signaling pathway, cellular metabolism and homeostasis, inflammation, and neuroinflammation. EtOH may also enhance the activity of key mediators including cytokines, such as IL-1ß, IL-6, and TNF, and transcription factors, such as JUN and STAT, while inhibiting the activity of anti-inflammatory mediators including glucocorticoid receptor. Furthermore, IL-1ß, IL-6, TNF, JUN, and STAT were mapped to 10 pathways predicted to associate with SARS-CoV-2 proteins, including HMGB1, IL-1, and IL-6 signaling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analyses demonstrate that EtOH exposure may augment SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammation by altering the activity of key inflammatory mediators. Our findings suggest that it is important for clinicians to caution patients about the risk of alcohol consumption, which has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings also call for further investigation into how alcohol exposure affects viral infections.","Huang, Wenfei; Zhou, Heping; Hodgkinson, Colin; Montero, Angelo; Goldman, David; Chang, Sulie L",Alcohol Clin Exp Res,,273

In this study, we aimed to assess the efficacy of adding high-dose intravenous vitamin C (HDIVC) to the regimens for patients with severe COVID-19 disease. METHODS: An open-label, randomized, and controlled trial was conducted on patients with severe COVID-19 infection. The case and control treatment groups each consisted of 30 patients. The control group received lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine and the case group received HDIVC (6 g daily) added to the same regimen. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between two groups with respect to age and gender, laboratory results, and underlying diseases. The mean body temperature was significantly lower in the case group on the 3rd day of hospitalization (p = 0.001). Peripheral capillary oxygen saturations (SpO2) measured at the 3rd day of hospitalization was also higher in the case group receiving HDIVC (p = 0.014). The median length of hospitalization in the case group was significantly longer than the control group (8.5 days vs. 6.5 days) (p = 0.028).

290610,Rapid response to the COVID-19 pandemic: Vietnam government's experience and preliminary success,2020,"At the University Hospital of the West Indies, breast-feeding is actively promoted by education of the mothers, limiting the availability of complementary bottle feeds, and preventing the access of commercial ""milk nurses"" to the hospital. A 12-month longitudinal survey of 82 infants was undertaken to evaluate this approach. Although most mothers (65 percent) breast-fed fully in hospital by 3 weeks, only 25 percent were still breast-feeding fully. Partial breast-feeding was not prolonged-at 5 months only 38 percent of the infants were still breast-fed. More women aged 25 years or older tended to breast-feed for 4 months or longer (69 percent) although they appeared less successful at complete breast-feeding in hospital (41 percent) than younger women (77 percent). This decline in breast-feeding occurred in a context of poverty in which the majority of mothers' weekly income (88 percent) was spent on food. Commercial ""milk nurses"" continued to visit and give samples (16 percent). As the prgramme to promote breast-feeding could not be precisely defined, the relationship between the programme and the infant feeding practices was unclear (AU)","Landman, Jacqueline P; Shaw Lyon, Violet",West Indian med. j,,273

We developed highly sensitive SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody and neutralization assays. SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein or Nucleocapsid protein specific IgG antibodies at titers more than 1:100,000 were detectable in all PCR+ subjects (n = 115) and were absent in the negative controls. Other isotype antibodies (IgA, IgG1-4) were also detected. SARS-CoV-2 neutralization was determined in COVID-19 and convalescent plasma at up to 10,000-fold dilution, using Spike protein pseudotyped lentiviruses, which were also blocked by neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). Hospitalized patients had up to 3000-fold higher antibody and neutralization titers compared to outpatients or convalescent plasma donors. Interestingly, some COVID-19 patients also possessed NAbs against SARS-CoV Spike protein pseudovirus. Together these results demonstrate the high specificity and sensitivity of our assays, which may impact understanding the quality or duration of the antibody response during COVID-19 and in determining the effectiveness of potential vaccines.","Dogan, Mikail; Kozhaya, Lina; Placek, Lindsey; Gunter, Courtney; Yigit, Mesut; Hardy, Rachel; Plassmeyer, Matthew; Coatney, Paige; Lillard, Kimberleigh; Bukhari, Zaheer; Kleinberg, Michael; Hayes, Chelsea; Arditi, Moshe; Klapper, Ellen; Merin, Noah; Liang, Bruce Tsan-Tang; Gupta, Raavi; Alpan, Oral; Unutmaz, Derya",Commun Biol,,273

Aims: This study examines the prevalence of overweight/obesity and associated factors in type 2 diabetic patients in the Beni-Mellal Khenifra region in Morocco. Methods: A questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was conducted in 2017 among 975 diabetes patients attending primary health centres. Demographic and clinical data were collected through face-to-face interviews. Anthropometric measurements, including body weight, height and waist circumference, were taken using standardized techniques and calibrated equipment. Results: The prevalence of overweight was 40.4%, the general obesity was 28.8% and the abdominal obesity was 73.7%. Using multivariate analysis, we noted that the general obesity was associated with female sex (AOR= 3,004, 95% CI: 1.761-5.104, P<0.001), increased age (AOR=2.192, 95% CI: 1.116-4.307, P<0.023) and good glycaemic control (AOR=1.594, 95% CI: 1.056-2.407, P=0.027), whereas abdominal obesity was associated wih female sex (AOR=2.654, 95% CI: 1.507-4.671, P<0.001) and insulin treatment (AOR=2.927, 95% CI: 1.031-8.757, P=0.048). Conclusion: Overweight, general obesity and abdominal obesity were high among participants, especially among women.

This approach is developed based on an individual directed graph (IDG), using multi-layer bidirectional path tracking and inference searching. The IDG is determined by the appearance timeline and spatial data that can adapt over time. Additionally, the approach takes into consideration the incubation period and several features that can represent real-world circumstances, such as the number of asymptomatic carriers present. After each update of confirmed cases, the model collects the interaction features and infers the individual person's probability of getting infected using the status of the surrounding people. The CLIIP approach is validated using the individualized bidirectional SEIR model to simulate the contagion process. Compared to traditional contact tracing methods, our approach significantly reduces the screening and quarantine required to search for the potential asymptomatic virus carriers by as much as 94%.","Liu, Shangching; Liu, Koyun; Chiang, Hwaihai; Zhang, Jianwei; Systems, Tsungyao Chang Synergies Intelligent; Inc.,; Hamburg, University of",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.04646v2.pdf,273

It remains unclear whether the history of cerebrovascular disease is associated with in-hospital death in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, multicenter cohort study at Mount Sinai Health System in New York City. Using our institutional data warehouse, we identified all adult patients who were admitted to the hospital between March 1, 2020 and May 1, 2020 and had a positive nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in the emergency department. Using our institutional electronic health record, we extracted clinical characteristics of the cohort, including age, sex, and comorbidities. Using multivariable logistic regression to control for medical comorbidities, we modeled the relationship between history of stroke and all-cause, in-hospital death. RESULTS: We identified 3248 patients, of whom 387 (11.9%) had a history of stroke. Compared with patients without history of stroke, patients with a history of stroke were significantly older, and were significantly more likely to have a history of all medical comorbidities except for obesity, which was more prevalent in patients without a history of stroke. Compared with patients without history of stroke, patients with a history of stroke had higher in-hospital death rates during the study period (48.6% versus 31.7%, P<0.001). In the multivariable analysis, history of stroke (adjusted odds ratio, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.01-1.63]) was significantly associated with in-hospital death. CONCLUSIONS: We found that history of stroke was associated with in-hospital death among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Further studies should confirm these results.","Kummer, Benjamin R; Klang, Eyal; Stein, Laura K; Dhamoon, Mandip S; Jetté, Nathalie",Stroke,,273

Remote monitoring alerts, particularly those associated with heart failure trends, have proved useful in guiding care in regard to monitoring fluid status and adjusting heart failure medications. Case summary This report describes use of Boston Scientific's HeartLogic algorithm, which is a multisensor device algorithm in implantable cardioverter-defibrillator devices that is proven to be an early predictor of heart failure decompensation by measuring several variables, including respiratory rate, nighttime heart rate, and heart sounds. We present three cases of patients who were actively surveilled by the various HeartLogic device algorithm sensors and were identified to have increasing respiratory rates high enough to trigger a HeartLogic alert prior to a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. Discussion We propose that the HeartLogic algorithm and its accompanying individual physiologic sensors demonstrate potential for use in identifying non-heart failure-related decompensation, such as COVID-19-positive diagnoses.","Yapejian, A.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have been shown to improve the survival in metastatic NSCLC, but are far from being accepted as an induction therapy. METHODS: We retrospectively collected data of all patients who received induction ICI (nivolumab or pembrolizumab) and chemotherapy (carboplatin with paclitaxel) for stage IIIA-B NSCLC followed by surgery in our unit between January 2019 and March 2020. RESULTS: Of the 12 patients (9 males, 3 females) 6 had a squamous cell carcinoma, 3 had adenocarcinoma, 1 had an undifferentiated adenocarcinoma and 1 had adeno-squamous carcinoma. Seven patients had stage IIIA disease and 5 had stage IIIB. After induction therapy, 6 patients had stable disease and 6 had a partial response. The median tumor reduction was 3.05 cm (range 2.30-8.70). All patients, but one due to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 outbreak, had no delay in surgery. Two patients experienced myelosuppression after induction therapy, two had minor adverse effects. Three patients had postoperative complications not related to the induction therapy. All patients had a pathological response: 5 complete, 4 major and 3 partial. Eleven patients are alive (mean months of follow-up 18.17±4.97) and free of disease. CONCLUSIONS: Induction ICI-chemotherapy may be a valid treatment in patients with locally advanced NSCLC, providing important tumor downstaging and rendering patients operable.

302839,The impact of COVID-19 on the travelling community in primary care,2021,"BACKGROUND: Planning for extreme surges in demand for hospital care of patients requiring urgent life-saving treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), while retaining capacity for other emergency conditions, is one of the most challenging tasks faced by health care providers and policymakers during the pandemic. Health systems must be well-prepared to cope with large and sudden changes in demand by implementing interventions to ensure adequate access to care. We developed the first planning tool for the COVID-19 pandemic to account for how hospital provision interventions (such as cancelling elective surgery, setting up field hospitals, or hiring retired staff) will affect the capacity of hospitals to provide life-saving care. METHODS: We conducted a review of interventions implemented or considered in 12 European countries in March to April 2020, an evaluation of their impact on capacity, and a review of key parameters in the care of COVID-19 patients. This information was used to develop a planner capable of estimating the impact of specific interventions on doctors, nurses, beds, and respiratory support equipment. We applied this to a scenario-based case study of 1 intervention, the set-up of field hospitals in England, under varying levels of COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: The Abdul Latif Jameel Institute for Disease and Emergency Analytics pandemic planner is a hospital planning tool that allows hospital administrators, policymakers, and other decision-makers to calculate the amount of capacity in terms of beds, staff, and crucial medical equipment obtained by implementing the interventions. Flexible assumptions on baseline capacity, the number of hospitalizations, staff-to-beds ratios, and staff absences due to COVID-19 make the planner adaptable to multiple settings. The results of the case study show that while field hospitals alleviate the burden on the number of beds available, this intervention is futile unless the deficit of critical care nurses is addressed first. DISCUSSION: The tool supports decision-makers in delivering a fast and effective response to the pandemic. The unique contribution of the planner is that it allows users to compare the impact of interventions that change some or all inputs.","Christen, Paula; D039,; Aeth, Josh C; Løchen, Alessandra; McCabe, Ruth; Rizmie, Dheeya; Schmit, Nora; Nayagam, Shevanthi; Miraldo, Marisa; Aylin, Paul; Bottle, Alex; Perez-Guzman, Pablo N; Donnelly, Christl A; Ghani, Azra C; Ferguson, Neil M; White, Peter J; Hauck, Katharina",Med Care,,273

305093,A call for Essays: stories from the frontline during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"In December 2019, an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first identified in Wuhan, China. The characteristics of COVID-19 patients treated in local hospitals in Wuhan are not fully representative of patients outside Wuhan. Therefore, it is highly essential to analyze the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in areas outside Wuhan or Hubei Province. To date, a limited number of studies have concentrated on the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with different genders, clinical classification, and with or without basic diseases. AIM To study the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients in Hengyang (China) and provide a reliable reference for the prevention and control of COVID-19. METHODS From January 16 to March 2, 2020, a total of 48 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported in Hengyang, and those cases were included in this study. The diagnostic criteria, clinical classification, and discharge standard related to COVID-19 were in line with the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (Trial Version 7) released by National Health Commission and National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in pharyngeal swab specimens was detected by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. All the data were imported into the excel worksheet and statistically analyzed by using SPSS 25.0 software. RESULTS A total of 48 cases of COVID-19 were collected, of which 1 was mild, 38 were moderate, and 9 were severe. It was unveiled that there were 31 (64.6%) male patients and 17 (35.4%) female patients, with a female-to-male ratio of 1.82:1. The range of age of patients with COVID-19 was dominantly 30-49 years old [25 (52.1%) of 48], followed by those aged over 60 years old [11 (22.9%)]. Besides, 29.2% (14 of 48) of patients had basic diseases, and 57.2% (8 of 14) of patients with basic diseases were aged over 60 years old. The occupations of 48 COVID-19 patients were mainly farmers working in agricultural production [15 (31.5%) of 48], rural migrant workers from Hengyang to Wuhan [15 (31.5%)], and service workers operating in the service sector [8 (16.7%)]. The mean latent period was 6.86 ± 3.57 d, and the median was 7 [interquartile range (IQR): 4-9] d. The mean time from onset of symptoms to the first physician visit was 3.38 ± 2.98 (95%CI: 2.58-9.18) d, with a median of 2 (IQR: 1-5) d, and the mean time from hospital admission to confirmed diagnosis was 2.29 ± 2.11 (95%CI: 1.18-6.42) d, with a median of 2 (IQR: 1-3) d. The main symptoms were fever [43 (89.6%) of 48], cough and expectoration [41 (85.4%)], fatigue [22 (45.8%)], and chills [22 (45.8%)]. Other symptoms included poor appetite [13 (27.1%)], sore throat [9 (18.8%)], dyspnea [9 (18.8%)], diarrhea [7 (14.6%)], dizziness [5 (10.4%)], headache [5 (10.4%)], muscle pain [5 (10.4%)], nausea and vomiting [4 (8.3%)], hemoptysis [4 (8.3%)], and runny nose [1 (2.1%)]. The numbers of peripheral blood leukocytes, lymphocytes, and eosinophils were significantly reduced in the majority of the patients. The levels of C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, blood glucose, lactate dehydrogenase, Ddimer, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transferase (γ-GT), myoglobin (MB), and creatine kinase (CK) were increased in 64.6%, 44.7%, 43.2%, 37.0%, 29.5%, 22.9%,20.8%, 21.6%, 13.6%, and 12.8% of patients, respectively. The incidence of ALT elevation in male patients was remarkably higher than that in females (P &lt; 0.01), while the incidences of AST, CK, and blood glucose elevations in severe patients were remarkably higher than those in moderate patients (P &lt; 0.05, respectively). Except for the mild patients, chest computed tomography showed characteristic pulmonary lesions. All the patients received antiviral drugs, 38 (79.2%) accepted traditional Chinese medicine, and 2 (4.2%) received treatment of human umbilical-cord mesenchymal stem cells. On March 2, 2020, 48 patients with COVID-19 were all cured and discharged. CONCLUSION Based on our results, patients with COVID-19 often have multiple organ dysfunction or damage. The incidences of ALT elevation in males, and AST, CK, and blood glucose elevations in severe patients are remarkably higher.","Zhong, Zhe-Feng; Huang, Jia; Yang, Xia; Peng, Jin-Ling; Zhang, Xiao-Yan; Hu, Yang; Fu, Nian; Lin, Hai-Lian; Jiang, Bo; Tian, Ya-Ying; Yao, Hong-Yi; Deng, Li-Pu; Tang, Xiao-Qing; Zhou, Jie-Can; Tang, Jian; Xie, Xia; Liu, Qiong; Liu, Jing; Dou, Cheng-Yun; Dai, Rong-Juan; Yan, Bo; Yang, Xue-Feng",World J.

Los protocolos propugnan el uso de pruebas antigénicas rápidas que precisan de evaluación en la práctica clínica real. El objetivo fue evaluar la prueba diagnóstica de detección rápida de antígeno, Panbio Covid rapid test, comparada con la PCR, en los pacientes con clínica de 5 o menos días de evolución y con alta sospecha de infección por covid-19 en un centro de salud. Materiales y Métodos: 103 pacientes mayores de 14 años que acudieron a un centro de salud urbano ubicado en el Distrito de Usera de Madrid, con alta sospecha de infección por covid-19, en los primeros 5 días de evolución desde el inicio de los síntomas durante el mes de noviembre de 2020. Intervenciones: se realizan las pruebas diagnósticas de Covid-19: antígeno y PCR. Resultados: La prevalencia de la enfermedad fue del 24.3% según la prueba PCR y 17.5% según el test antigénico rápido. La sensibilidad fue de 72% (IC al 95%: 54.3-89.6%). La especificidad fue del 100%. Los valores predictivos positivo y negativo fueron del 100% y del 91.8% respectivamente. En el análisis bivariante, no hubo relación entre los síntomas y la presencia de enfermedad, excepto para las mialgias (p=0.030). En el análisis multivariado se encontró relación entre la tos, la disnea, la fiebre, las mialgias, la anosmia/ageusia y los síntomas oculares y la presencia de enfermedad. Conclusiones: la sensibilidad y la especificidad para el test de antígeno rápido Panbio son similares a otros estudios realizados en atención primaria. En prevalencia alta de enfermedad y con síntomas de alta sospecha, los resultados positivos del test se pueden considerar definitivos, pero los resultados negativos requerirán confirmación. Las mialgias, la fiebre, la disnea, la anosmia/ageusia y los síntomas oculares se pueden relacionar más con la presencia de covid-19. Objective: Covid-19 infection requires early diagnosis, with PCR being the gold standard test. The protocols advocate the use of rapid antigenic tests that require evaluation in actual clinical practice. The objective was to evaluate the diagnostic test for rapid antigen detection, Panbio Covid rapid test, compared with PCR, in patients with symptoms of 5 or less days of evolution and with a high suspicion of infection by covid-19 in a health center. Materials and Methods: 103 patients over 14 years of age who attended an urban health center located in the Usera District of Madrid, with high suspicion of covid-19 infection, in the first 5 days of evolution from the onset of symptoms during the month of November 2020. Interventions: diagnostic tests for Covid-19 are performed: antigen and PCR. Results: The prevalence of the disease was 24.3% according to the PCR test and 17.5% according to the rapid antigenic test. The sensitivity was 72% (95% CI: 54.3-89.6%). The specificity was 100%. The positive and negative predictive values were 100% and 91.8% respectively. In the bivariate analysis, there was no relationship between symptoms and the presence of disease, except for myalgias (p = 0.030). The multivariate analysis found a relationship between cough, dyspnea, fever, myalgia, anosmia / ageusia, and ocular symptoms and the presence of disease. Conclusions: the sensitivity and specificity for the Panbio rapid antigen test are similar to other studies performed in primary care. In high prevalence of disease and with highly suspected symptoms, positive test results can be considered definitive, but negative results will require confirmation. Myalgia, fever, dyspnea, anosmia / ageusia, and ocular symptoms may be more related to the presence of covid-19.","Cortés Rubio, J. A.; Costa Zamora, M.

307133,How the COVID-19 pandemic highlights the lack of accessible public spaces in Tehran,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Concern about trainee work-related well-being has been raised in recent years and is the subject of several reviews, reports and research studies. This study aimed to understand the experiences of trainees working in a large intensive care unit during the first surge of the COVID-19 pandemic from an educational and operational perspective in order to highlight what worked and what could be improved. DESIGN: A qualitative study using peer-to-peer semistructured interviews, developed using appreciative inquiry methodology, was conducted during July 2020. Responses were analysed using a thematic analysis technique. SETTING: A large, tertiary intensive care unit in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: All trainees in anaesthesia and intensive care working on the intensive care unit during the first surge were invited to participate. RESULTS: Forty interviews were conducted and four over-arching themes were identified. These were: feeling safe and supported; physical demands; the emotional burden of caring; and a sense of fulfilment, value and personal development. Positive aspects of the organisational response to the pandemic included communication, personal protective equipment supply, team working and well-being support. Suggestions for improvement focused on rest facilities, rota patterns and hierarchies, creating opportunities for reflection and ensuring continued educational and training opportunities despite operational demands. CONCLUSIONS: Trainees described opportunities for learning and fulfilment, as well as challenges, in working through a pandemic. Trainees described their needs and how well these were met during the pandemic. Ideas for improvement most frequently related to basic needs including safety and fatigue, but suggestions also related to supporting learning and development. The appreciative inquiry methodology of the project facilitated effective reflection on positive aspects of trainee experiences.","Warren, Jennifer; Plunkett, Emma; Rudge, James; Stamoulis, Christina; Torlinski, Tomasz; Tarrant, Carolyn; Mullhi, Randeep",BMJ Open,,273

309798,Can lactoferrin boost human immunity against COVID-19?,2020,"Recently, the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly across the world. Due to the large number of infected patients and heavy labor for doctors, computer-aided diagnosis with machine learning algorithm is urgently needed, and could largely reduce the efforts of clinicians and accelerate the diagnosis process. Chest computed tomography (CT) has been recognized as an informative tool for diagnosis of the disease. In this study, we propose to conduct the diagnosis of COVID-19 with a series of features extracted from CT images. To fully explore multiple features describing CT images from different views, a unified latent representation is learned which can completely encode information from different aspects of features and is endowed with promising class structure for separability. Specifically, the completeness is guaranteed with a group of backward neural networks (each for one type of features), while by using class labels the representation is enforced to be compact within COVID-19/community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and also a large margin is guaranteed between different types of pneumonia. In this way, our model can well avoid overfitting compared to the case of directly projecting highdimensional features into classes. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms all comparison methods, and rather stable performances are observed when varying the number of training data.","Kang, Hengyuan; Xia, Liming; Yan, Fuhua; Wan, Zhibin; Shi, Feng; Yuan, Huan; Jiang, Huiting; Wu, Dijia; Sui, He; Zhang, Changqing; Shen, Dinggang",IEEE. trans. med. imaging,,273

Based on the historical data collected for COVID-19 spreading in 367 cities in China and the set of parameters of the augmented Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model obtained for each city, a set of profile codes representing a variety of transmission mechanisms and contact topologies is formed. By comparing the data of an early outbreak of a given population with the complete set of historical profiles, the best fit profiles are selected and the corresponding sets of profile codes are used for prediction of the future progression of the epidemic in that population. Application of the method to the data collected for South Korea, Italy and Iran shows that peaks of infection cases are expected to occur before mid April, the end of March and the end of May 2020, and that the percentage of population infected in each city or region will be less than 0.01%, 0.5% and 0.5%, for South Korea, Italy and Iran, respectively.","Zhan, Choujun; Tse, Chi K; Lai, Zhikang; Hao, Tianyong; Su, Jingjing",PLoS One,,273

NETs have emerged as critical mediators of lung damage, inflammation and thrombosis in COVID-19 and other diseases, but there are no therapeutics to prevent or reduce NETs that are available to patients. Here, we show that neutrophils isolated from hospitalised patients with COVID-19 produce significantly more NETs in response to LPS compared to cells from healthy control subjects. A subset of patients were captured at follow-up clinics (3-4 month post-infection) and while LPS-induced NET formation is significantly lower at this time point, it remains elevated compared to healthy controls. LPS- and PMA-induced NETs were significantly inhibited by the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor ruboxistaurin. Ruboxistaurin-mediated inhibition of NETs in healthy neutrophils reduces NET-induced epithelial cell death. Our findings suggest ruboxistaurin could reduce proinflammatory and tissue-damaging consequences of neutrophils during disease, and since it has completed phase III trials for other indications without safety concerns, it is a promising and novel therapeutic strategy for COVID-19.","Dowey, Rebecca; Cole, Joby; Thompson, A A Roger; Huang, Chenghao; Whatmore, Jacob; Iqbal, Ahmed; Bradley, Kirsty L; McKenzie, Joanne; Hull, Rebecca C; Lawrie, Allan; Condliffe, Alison M; Kiss-Toth, Endre; Sabroe, Ian; Prince, Lynne R",,,273

Burnout was defined as reporting ""once a week"", ""a few times a week"" or ""everyday"" on either the emotional exhaustion or depersonalization domains of the MBI. Two open-ended questions were added to the survey for the Danish urologists, these were then qualitatively analyzed using thematic analysis. Categorial variables were compared using Chi square analysis. RESULTS: The response rate was 193/387 (49.9%) for the Danish urologists and 43/64 (67.12%) among American urologists. The prevalence of burnout for the American and Danish cohorts was identified in 4 (44.4%) of the American residents and 10 (32.3%) of the American attendings compared to 2 (3%) of Danish residents and 16 (12.7%) of Danish attendings. The difference in rate of burnout between Danish residents and attendings was statistically significant (p=0.03). Burnout was statistically significantly different between American and Danish residents (p<0.01) and attendings (p<0.01). There was a statistically significant difference in rates of burnout between American and the Danish female urologists (p=0.02) and similarly among male urologists (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated low rates of burnout among Danish urologists and a significant difference in burnout between residents and attendings from Michigan compared to Danish residents and attendings.","Jacobsen, Frederik M; Jensen, Christian Fuglesang S; Schmidt, Mette L K; Qin, Yongmei; Akselberg, Nicholas John; Sønksen, Jens; Ohl, Dana A; Stork, Brian R",Urology,,273

However, little is known regarding the immunometabolic defects of T cells in COVID-19 patients, which may contribute to the deregulated immune functions of these cells. In this study, we longitudinally characterized the metabolic profiles of resting and activated T cells from acutely infected and convalescent COVID-19 patients by flow cytometry and confirmed the metabolic profiles with a Seahorse analyzer. Non-COVID-19 and healthy subjects were enrolled as controls. We found that ex vivo T cells from acutely infected COVID-19 patients were highly activated and apoptotic and displayed more extensive mitochondrial metabolic dysfunction, especially cells in CD8+ T cell lineages, than those from convalescent COVID-19 patients or healthy controls, but slightly disturbed mitochondrial metabolic activity was observed in non-COVID-19 patients. Importantly, plasma IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels positively correlated with mitochondrial mass and negatively correlated with fatty acid uptake in T cells from COVID-19 patients. Additionally, compared with those from healthy controls, in vitro-activated T cells from acutely infected COVID-19 patients showed signs of lower glycolysis, a reduced glycolytic capacity, and a decreased glycolytic reserve, accompanied by lower activation of mTOR signaling. Thus, newly identified defects in T cell mitochondrial metabolic functions and metabolic reprogramming upon activation might contribute to immune deficiency in COVID-19.","Liu, Xiaoju; Zhao, Juanjuan; Wang, Haiyan; Wang, Wan; Su, Xu; Liao, Xuejiao; Zhang, Shuye; Sun, Jian; Zhang, Zheng",J. immunol,,273

In the last years, advances in functional and genetic testing have improved the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to immune dysregulation syndromes. CTLA-4 deficiency is a rare disease with variable phenotype, ranging from absence of symptoms to severe multisystem manifestations and complications. We describe a rare case of CTLA-4 deficiency in a boy with gastric cancer, very early onset inflammatory bowel disease and polyautoimmunity, the second-ever reported in the literature with the same characteristics. A 17-year-old boy was referred to Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital of Rome, a tertiary care center, for a gastric mass and a long-term history of very early onset inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes mellitus type 1, polyarthritis and psoriasis. Histology of gastric biopsies revealed the presence of neoplastic signet ring cells. Imaging staging showed localized cancer; therefore, the patient underwent subtotal gastrectomy with termino-lateral gastro-jejunal anastomosis. Immunological work up and genetic testing by next-generation sequencing panels for primary immunodeficiencies led to the diagnosis of CTLA-4 deficiency. Good disease control was obtained with the administration of Abatacept. The patient experienced an asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection without any concern. Eighteen months after treatment initiation, the patient is alive and well. Immunologic and genetic testing, such as next-generation sequencing, should always be part of the diagnostic approach to patients with complex immune dysregulation syndrome, severe clinical course, poor response to treatments or cancer.

Use of anti-viral peptides (AVPs) although new but has shown tremendous potential against many pathogens. Previously AVPs have been designed against spike protein of corona virus which is the major entry mediating molecule. Using various in-silico strategies, in this research work AVPs have been modeled against lesser studied viral proteins namely ORF7a protein, Envelope protein (E), Nucleoprotein (N), and Non-Structural protein (Nsp1 and Nsp2). The predicted AVPs have been docked against various host as well as viral proteins. The interaction of small AVPs seems capable of interfering with binding between viral protein and its host counterpart. Therefore, these AVPs can act as a deterrent against novel corona virus, which requires further validation through laboratory techniques.","Sharma, Aditi; Pant, Kumud; Pande, Akshara; Sinha, Somya; Pant, Bhasker",,,273

We therefore aimed to compare key health and economic outcomes of NZ relative to OECD countries as of mid-June 2021. MethodsThis analysis compared health outcomes (cumulative death rates from COVID-19 and ""excess death"" rates) and economic measures (quarterly GDP and unemployment levels) across OECD countries. ResultsNZ had the lowest cumulative COVID-19 death rate in the OECD at 242 times lower than the 38-OECD-country average: 5{middle dot}2 vs 1256 per million population. When considering ""excess deaths"", NZ had the largest negative value in the OECD, equivalent to around 2000 fewer deaths than expected. When considering the average GDP change over the five quarters of 2020 to 2021-Q1, NZ was the sixth best performer (at 0{middle dot}5% vs -0{middle dot}3% for the OECD average). The increase in unemployment in NZ was also less than the OECD average (1{middle dot}1 percentage points to a peak of 5{middle dot}2%, vs 3{middle dot}3 points to 8{middle dot}6%, respectively). ConclusionsNew Zealands elimination strategy response to COVID-19 produced the best mortality protection outcomes in the OECD. In economic terms it also performed better than the OECD average in terms of adverse impacts on GDP and employment. Nevertheless, a fuller accounting of the benefits and costs needs to be done once the population is vaccinated and longer-term health and economic outcomes are considered.","Wilson, Nick; Grout, Leah; Summers, Jennifer A; Nghiem, Nhung; Baker, Michael G",,,273

METHODS: This is a three repeated measure population-based cross-sectional study. We recruited community older men aged > 60 years in three periods of the COVID-19 outbreak in Hong Kong, i.e., before the COVID-19 outbreak (2 July 2019-8 January 2020), between the 2nd and 3rd waves of COVID-19 (23 June 2020-9 July 2020), and during the 3rd wave of COVID-19 (15 September 2020-29 September 2020). Participants reported detailed information on their physical activity habits using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire and wore actigraphs continuously for 7 days (168 h). The actigraph data were then transferred to four rest-activity circadian rhythm parameters: midline statistic of rhythm (MESOR), amplitude, acrophase and percent rhythm. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to estimate the association of period effect of COVID-19 on physical activity and rest-activity circadian rhythm parameters. RESULTS: Among the 242 community older men, 106 (43.8%) of them were recruited before the COVID-19 outbreak, 66 (27.3%) were recruited between the 2nd and 3rd waves of COVID-19, and 70 (28.9%) were recruited during the late phase of the 3rd wave of COVID-19. Compared with those recruited before COVID-19, participants recruited between the 2nd and 3rd waves of COVID-19 had lower physical activity (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.03, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) =1.05-3.93), MESOR (AOR = 2.05, 95%CI = 1.01-4.18), and amplitude (AOR = 1.91, 95%CI = 0.95-3.83). There was no difference in physical activity or circadian rhythm parameters between subjects recruited before and during the late phase of the 3rd wave. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that the effect of COVID-19 on physical activity and rest-activity circadian rhythm for the community people may be short-term, indicating strong resilience of the community population. Although maintaining physical activity are encouraged for the older adults to sustain good health, a rebound in their physical activity may be a sign for the next wave of outbreak if insufficient social distancing and population protection are facilitated.","Lee, Priscilla Ming Yi; Huang, Bixia; Liao, Gengze; Chan, Chi Kuen; Tai, Lai-Bun; Tsang, Chun Yuk Jason; Leung, Chi Chiu; Kwan, Mei-Po; Tse, Lap Ah",BMC Public Health,,273

Field research conducted in shrines and on several pilgrimage routes involved interviews with shrine custodians and staff as well as pilgrims. Data regarding tourism and pilgrimage movement were also gathered. Research results have shown that the tourism and pilgrimage movement to the analysed shrines decreased by 90-95% during the first six months of the pandemic. The shrines in Santiago de Compostela and Lourdes were closed for a few weeks during the first wave of coronavirus spread. The influence of the pandemic on the age structure of pilgrims is noticeable, with a distinct decrease in the number of pilgrims aged 60 + . Also, the reasons for pilgrimages to shrines have changed. The overriding principle followed by shrine custodians and organisers of pilgrimages was to ensure the safety of pilgrims on their way to shrines and, most importantly, in the shrine areas. The largest Catholic shrines in Europe encouraged pilgrims to deepen their bonds with the shrine through participation in online services and prayers and to pursue spiritual and virtual pilgrimages. The study also shows a model of the development of pilgrimages and religious tourism during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Mróz, Franciszek",J Relig Health,,273

323725,Developing a Flexible National Wastewater Surveillance System for COVID-19 and Beyond,2021,"Advances in computer and communications technology have deeply affected the way we communicate. Social media have emerged as a major means of human communication. However, a major limitation in such media is the lack of non-verbal stimuli, which sometimes hinders the understanding of the message, and in particular the associated emotional content. In an effort to compensate for this, people started to use emoticons, which are combinations of keyboard characters that resemble facial expressions, and more recently their evolution: emojis, namely, small colorful images that resemble faces, actions and daily life objects. This paper presents evidence of the effect of emojis on memory retrieval through a functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) study. A total number of fifteen healthy volunteers were recruited for the experiment, during which successive stimuli were presented, containing words with intense emotional content combined with emojis, either with congruent or incongruent emotional content. Volunteers were asked to recall a memory related to the stimulus. The study of the reaction times showed that emotional incongruity among word+emoji combinations led to longer reaction times in memory retrieval compared to congruent combinations. General Linear Model (GLM) and Blind Source Separation (BSS) methods have been tested in assessing the influence of the emojis on the process of memory retrieval. The analysis of the fMRI data showed that emotional incongruity among word+emoji combinations activated the Broca's area (BA44 and BA45) in both hemispheres, the Supplementary Motor Area (SMA) and the inferior prefrontal cortex (BA47), compared to congruent combinations. Furthermore, compared to pseudowords, word+emoji combinations activated the left Broca's area (BA44 and BA45), the amygdala, the right temporal pole (BA48) and several frontal regions including the SMA and the inferior prefrontal cortex.","Chatzichristos, Christos; Morante, Manuel; Andreadis, Nikolaos; Kofidis, Eleftherios; Kopsinis, Yiannis; Theodoridis, Sergios",PLoS One,,273

327852,Positive outcomes associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia,2021,"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has caused substantial public health burden and widespread anxiety. The adverse mental health effects caused by COVID-19 may be particularly acute for individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). For the present study, we developed an online survey to investigate how COVID-19 has affected the OCD community. The survey included both quantitative and qualitative questions to assess multiple facets of how the pandemic has affected individuals with OCD symptoms. Responses were collected from adults with self-identified OCD recruited from OCD-specific forums and websites (n = 252). The majority (76.2 %) of respondents reported that their OCD symptoms had worsened since the outbreak, though there was substantial variability in individual responses. Negative effects of COVID-19 were more strongly linked to contamination and responsibility for harm symptoms than for other symptom dimensions. The self-identified OCD group also reported heightened concerns about COVID-19 compared to a community control sample recruited through Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Lastly, many participants reported that the pandemic had interfered with their OCD treatment, yet they remained mostly satisfied with how their treatment providers had handled the crisis. These results highlight the importance of considering how COVID-19 has affected the OCD community, with possible implications for treatment providers.","Wheaton, Michael G; Ward, Haley E; Silber, Alana; McIngvale, Elizabeth; Björgvinsson, Thröstur",J Anxiety Disord,,273

This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and related risk factors for anxiety and depression in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed on patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Sino-French New City branch of Wuhan Tongji Hospital from January to February 2020. The Zung Self-Rating Anxiety and Depression Scales were used to evaluate the prevalence of anxiety and depression. Demographic, clinical, and sociological data were also collected. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent risk factors of anxiety and depression in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: In the current study, 183 patients were enrolled (mean age = 53 ± 9 years; 41.1% women). The prevalences of anxiety and depression were 56.3% and 39.3%, respectively. Logistic regression analysis revealed that older age, female sex, being divorced or widowed, COVID-19 disease duration, renal disease, and depression were identified as independent risk factors for anxiety in patients with COVID-19. Factors that were associated with depression were female sex, being widowed, COVID-19 disease duration, and anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a high prevalence of anxiety and depression in patients with COVID-19 at the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, China. The identification of demographic, clinical, and social factors may help identify health care professionals to provide psychological care as part of treatment for patients with COVID-19 and other life-threatening infectious diseases.","Li, Tao; Sun, Siwei; Liu, Bao; Wang, Jing; Zhang, Yalan; Gong, Cheng; Duan, Jun",Psychosom Med,,273

329772,Risk communication and community engagement strategies for COVID-19 in 13 African countries,2021,"BACKGROUND: The recent global pandemic has placed a high priority on identifying drugs to prevent or lessen clinical infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), caused by Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: We applied two computational approaches to identify potential therapeutics. First, we sought to identify existing FDA approved drugs that could block coronaviruses from entering cells by binding to ACE2 or TMPRSS2 using a high-throughput AI-based binding affinity prediction platform. Second, we sought to identify FDA approved drugs that could attenuate the gene expression patterns induced by coronaviruses, using our Disease Cancelling Technology (DCT) platform. RESULTS: Top results for ACE2 binding iincluded several ACE inhibitors, a beta-lactam antibiotic, two antiviral agents (Fosamprenavir and Emricasan) and glutathione. The platform also assessed specificity for ACE2 over ACE1, important for avoiding counterregulatory effects. Further studies are needed to weigh the benefit of blocking virus entry against potential counterregulatory effects and possible protective effects of ACE2. However, the data herein suggest readily available drugs that warrant experimental evaluation to assess potential benefit. DCT was run on an animal model of SARS-CoV, and ranked compounds by their ability to induce gene expression signals that counteract disease-associated signals. Top hits included Vitamin E, ruxolitinib, and glutamine. Glutathione and its precursor glutamine were highly ranked by two independent methods, suggesting both warrant further investigation for potential benefit against SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: While these findings are not yet ready for clinical translation, this report highlights the potential use of two bioinformatics technologies to rapidly discover existing therapeutic agents that warrant further investigation for established and emerging disease processes.","Kim, Jason; Zhang, Jenny; Cha, Yoonjeong; Kolitz, Sarah; Funt, Jason; Escalante Chong, Renan; Barrett, Scott; Kusko, Rebecca; Zeskind, Ben; Kaufman, Howard",J Transl Med,,273

Reliable and rapid diagnostic tests for COVID-19 are crucial to control and manage the outbreak. Here, a label-free square wave voltammetry-based biosensing platform for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal samples is reported. The sensor was constructed on screen-printed carbon electrodes coated with gold nanoparticles. The electrodes were functionalized using 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) which was used for the immobilization of an antibody against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N protein). The binding of the immunosensor with the N protein caused a change in the electrochemical signal. The detection was realised by measuring the change in reduction peak current of a redox couple using square wave voltammetry at 0.04 V versus Ag ref. electrode on the immunosensor upon binding with the N protein. The electrochemical immunosensor showed high sensitivity with a linear range from 1.0 pg.mL-1 to 100 ng.mL-1 and a limit of detection of 0.4 pg.mL-1 for the N protein in PBS buffer pH 7.4. Moreover, the immunosensor did not exhibit significant response with other viruses such as HCoV, MERS-CoV, Flu A and Flu B, indicating the high selectivity of the sensor for SARS-CoV-2. However, cross reactivity of the biosensor with SARS-CoV is indicated, which gives ability of the sensor to detect both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The biosensor was successfully applied to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus in clinical samples showing good correlation between the biosensor response and the RT-PCR cycle threshold values. We believe that the capability of miniaturization, low-cost and fast response of the proposed label-free electrochemical immunosensor will facilitate the point-of-care diagnosis of COVID 19 and help prevent further spread of infection.","Eissa, Shimaa; Alhadrami, Hani A; Al-Mozaini, Maha; Hassan, Ahmed M; Zourob, Mohammed",Mikrochim Acta,,273
330558,Testing for COVID-19 regulates behavior in the general population: A qualitative study of experiences of awaiting test result for COVID-19,2021,"The recent emergence of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) as a pandemic affecting millions of individuals has raised great concern throughout the world, and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the causative agent for COVID-19. The multifunctional protein angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is accepted as its primary target for entry into host cells. In its enzymatic function, ACE2, like its homologue ACE, regulates the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) critical for cardiovascular and renal homeostasis in mammals. Unlike ACE, however, ACE2 drives an alternative RAS pathway by degrading Ang-II and thus operates to balance RAS homeostasis in the context of hypertension, heart failure, and cardiovascular as well as renal complications of diabetes. Outside the RAS, ACE2 hydrolyzes key peptides, such as amyloid-ß, apelin, and [des-Arg9]-bradykinin. In addition to its enzymatic functions, ACE2 is found to regulate intestinal amino acid homeostasis and the gut microbiome. Although the non-enzymatic function of ACE2 as the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 has been well established, the contribution of enzymatic functions of ACE2 to the pathogenesis of COVID-19-related lung injury has been a matter of debate. A complete understanding of this central enzyme may begin to explain the various symptoms and pathologies seen in SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, and may aid in the development of novel treatments for COVID-19.","Oz, Murat; Lorke, Dietrich Ernst",Biomed Pharmacother,,273

333062,From Economic Recovery to Health Resilience,2021,"INTRODUCTION: We aimed to give a global overview of trends in access to sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and what is being done to mitigate its impact. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a descriptive analysis and content analysis based on an online survey among clinicians, researchers, and organizations. Our data were extracted from multiple-choice questions on access to SRHR services and risk of SRHR violations, and written responses to open-ended questions on threats to access and required response. RESULTS: The survey was answered by 51 people representing 29 countries. Eighty-six percent reported that access to contraceptive services was less or much less because of COVID-19, corresponding figures for surgical and medical abortion were 62% and 46%. The increased risk of gender-based and sexual violence was assessed as moderate or severe by 79%. Among countries with mildly restrictive abortion policies, 69% had implemented changes to facilitate access to abortion during the pandemic, compared with none among countries with severe restrictions (P < .001), 87.5% compared with 46% had implemented changes to facilitate access to contraception (P = .023). The content analysis showed that (a) prioritizations in health service delivery at the expense of SRHR, (b) lack of political will, (c) the detrimental effect of lockdown, and (d) the suspension of sexual education, were threats to SRHR access (theme 1). Requirements to mitigate these threats (theme 2) were (a) political will and support of universal access to SRH services, (b) the sensitization of providers, (c) free public transport, and (d) physical protective equipment. A contrasting third theme was the state of exception of the COVID-19 pandemic as a window of opportunity to push forward women's health and rights. CONCLUSIONS: Many countries have seen decreased access to and increased violations of SRHR during the COVID-19 pandemic. Countries with severe restrictions on abortion seem less likely to have implemented changes to SRHR delivery to mitigate this impact. Political will to support the advancement of SRHR is often lacking, which is fundamental to ensuring both continued access and, in a minority of cases, the solidification of gains made to SRHR during the pandemic.","Endler, Margit; Al-Haidari, Taghreed; Benedetto, Chiara; Chowdhury, Sameena; Christilaw, Jan; El Kak, Faysal; Galimberti, Diana; Garcia-Moreno, Claudia; Gutierrez, Miguel; Ibrahim, Shaimaa; Kumari, Shantha; McNicholas, Colleen; Mostajo Flores, Desirée; Muganda, John; Ramirez-Negrin, Atziri; Senanayake, Hemantha; Sohail, Rubina; Temmerman, Marleen; Gemzell-Danielsson, Kristina",Acta obstet. gynecol. scand,,273

With the partial ebbing of the pandemic in some areas, universities and healthcare organizations conducting HPR are considering reopening. Whereas guidelines from governmental authorities and medical specialty societies currently exist to help restarting health services and resuming clinical trials, no clear guidance is available to aid resumption of HPR at community-based observational cohort studies. Indefinite stoppage of observational research at cohort studies carries many drawbacks and its safe resumption is important and feasible. In this narrative review, we describe a potential path forward for safely reopening community-based observational studies, drawing on scientific knowledge and best practices from a variety of medical and lay sources. We highlight current recommendations regarding pandemic status assessment and the metrics useful for guiding decisions regarding safe reopening/reclosing and for screening and surveillance of COVID-19 among employees and participants. We synthesize insights from contemporary literature regarding infection prevention and environmental safety into a set of easy to operationalize plans for restructuring HPR. And lastly, we suggest ways in which observational studies can potentially aid the efforts to characterize the pandemic.","Velagaleti, Raghava S; Vasan, Ramachandran S",J Am Heart Assoc,,273

339941,Cultivating the Therapeutic Alliance in a Telemental Health Setting,2021,"BACKGROUND: Daily new COVID-19 cases from January to April 2020 demonstrate varying patterns of SARS-CoV-2 transmission across different geographical regions. Constant infection rates were observed in some countries, whereas China and South Korea had a very low number of daily new cases. In fact, China and South Korea successfully and quickly flattened their COVID-19 curve. To understand why this was the case, this paper investigated possible aerosol-forming patterns in the atmosphere and their relationship to the policy measures adopted by select countries. OBJECTIVE: The main research objective was to compare the outcomes of policies adopted by countries between January and April 2020. Policies included physical distancing measures that in some cases were associated with mask use and city disinfection. We investigated whether the type of social distancing framework adopted by some countries (ie, without mask use and city disinfection) led to the continual dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 (daily new cases) in the community during the study period. METHODS: We examined the policies used as a preventive framework for virus community transmission in some countries and compared them to the policies adopted by China and South Korea. Countries that used a policy of social distancing by 1-2 m were divided into two groups. The first group consisted of countries that implemented social distancing (1-2 m) only, and the second comprised China and South Korea, which implemented distancing with additional transmission/isolation measures using masks and city disinfection. Global daily case maps from Johns Hopkins University were used to provide time-series data for the analysis. RESULTS: The results showed that virus transmission was reduced due to policies affecting SARS-CoV-2 propagation over time. Remarkably, China and South Korea obtained substantially better results than other countries at the beginning of the epidemic due to their adoption of social distancing (1-2 m) with the additional use of masks and sanitization (city disinfection). These measures proved to be effective due to the atmosphere carrier potential of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm that social distancing by 1-2 m with mask use and city disinfection yields positive outcomes. These strategies should be incorporated into prevention and control policies and be adopted both globally and by individuals as a method to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.","Telles, Charles Roberto; Roy, Archisman; Ajmal, Mohammad Rehan; Mustafa, Syed Khalid; Ahmad, Mohammad Ayaz; de la Serna, Juan Moises; Frigo, Elisandro Pires; Rosales, Manuel Hernández",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,273

First, all patients were randomly assigned to a training cohort or a validation cohort. By univariate analysis of the training cohort, we developed combination scores and screened the superior score for predicting the prognosis. Subsequently, we identified the independent factors influencing prognosis. Finally, we demonstrated the predictive efficiency of the score in validation cohort.A total of 145 patients were enrolled. In the training cohort, nonsurvivors had higher levels of lactic dehydrogenase than survivors. Among the 7 combination scores that were developed, lactic dehydrogenase-lymphocyte ratio (LLR) had the highest area under the curve (AUC) value for predicting prognosis, and it was associated with the incidence of liver injury, renal injury, and higher disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) score on admission. Univariate logistic regression analysis revealed that C-reactive protein, DIC score &#8805;2 and LLR >345 were the factors associated with prognosis. Multivariate analysis showed that only LLR >345 was an independent risk factor for prognosis (odds ratio [OR] = 9.176, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.674-31.487, Pâ<â.001). Lastly, we confirmed that LLR was also an independent risk factor for prognosis in severe COVID-19 patients in the validation cohort where the AUC was 0.857 (95% CI: 0.718-0.997).LLR is an accurate predictive score for poor prognosis of severe COVID-19 patients.","Li, Guojun; Xu, Fumin; Yin, Xinru; Wu, Na; Li, Yuanjie; Zhang, Tinghong; Chen, Dongfeng; Liu, Kaijun; Qiu, Qiu",Medicine (Baltimore),,273

The flow rate, type, and severity of cases presented to emergency departments varied during the pandemic in comparison to the past years. However, this change has not been well-described among the cases of hospital admission due to toxic exposure. STUDY OBJECTIVE: Recognition of the pattern of toxic exposure among the cases refereed to Tanta Poison Control Center (TPCC; Tanta, Egypt) during the past five years, and furthermore, exploration of the impact of lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic on the pattern of presented cases. METHODS: The current study is a five-year retrospective, comparative cross-sectional study carried out among acutely intoxicated patients admitted to TPCC during the spring months (March through May) of 2016-2020. A total of 1,916 patients with complete medical records were recruited. The type and manner of toxic exposure, demographic, clinical data, and outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: The current study noted that there were delays in time from toxic exposure to emergency services during the lockdown period. This was reflected in significant lower recovery rates (884.8/1,000 population; z = -3.0) and higher death rates (49.4/1,000 population; z = 2.1) despite the marked decrease in the total number of hospital admissions in comparison to the past four years. The lockdown period showed significantly higher phosphides (z = 3.5; &#967;2 = 34.295; P <.001) and antipsychotics exposure (z = 3.6; &#967;2 = 21.494; P <.001) than the previous years. However, predominance of female exposure and intentional self-poisoning was maintained over the past five years, including the lockdown. CONCLUSION: COVID-19-associated lockdown greatly reformed the usual intoxication pattern of the cases admitted to emergency room. Also, it played a role in delaying time of hospital arrival, which was reflected as lower recovery rates and higher death rates.","Fayed, Manar M; Sharif, Asmaa F",Prehosp Disaster Med,,273
345788,Neurohospitalist Practice and Well-Being During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Recent literature suggests that approximately 5%-18% of patients diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 may progress rapidly to a severe form of the illness and subsequent death. We examined the relationship between sociodemographic, clinical, and laboratory findings with mortality among patients. In this study, 112 patients were evaluated from February to May 2020 and 80 patients met the inclusion criteria. Tocilizumab was administered, followed by methylprednisolone to patients with pneumonia severity index score &#8804;130 and computerized tomography scan changes. Demographic data and clinical outcomes were collected. Laboratory biomarkers were monitored during hospitalization. Statistical analyses were performed with significance p &#8804; .05. A total of 80 patients: 45 males (56.25%) and 35 females (43.75%) met the study inclusion criteria. A total of 7 patients (8.75%) were deceased. An increase in mortality outcome was statistically significantly associated with higher average levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) with p value (.050), and d-dimer with p value (.024). Bivariate logistics regression demonstrated a significant increased odds for mortality for patients with bacterial lung infections (odds ratio [OR]: 10.83; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.05-57.40; p = .005) and multiorgan damage (OR: 103.50; 95% CI: 9.92-1079.55; p = .001). Multivariate logistics regression showed a statistically significant association for multiorgan damage (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 94.17; 95% CI: 7.39-1200.78; p = .001). We identified three main predictors for high mortality. These include IL-6, d-dimer, and multiorgan damage. The latter was the highest potential risk for in-hospital deaths. This warrants aggressive health measures for early recognition of the problem and initiation of treatment to reverse injuries.","Almaghlouth, Nouf K; Davis, Monique G; Davis, Michelle A; Anyiam, Felix E; Guevara, Roberto; Antony, Suresh J",J. med. virol,,273

352139,Suicide prevention and COVID-19: the role of primary care during the pandemic and beyond,2021,"BACKGROUND: Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been over 2 million deaths globally. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may be the main cause of death. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe the clinical features, outcomes, and ARDS characteristics of patients with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in Chongqing, China. METHODS: The epidemiology of COVID-19 from January 21, 2020, to March 15, 2020, in Chongqing, China, was analyzed retrospectively, and 75 ICU patients from two hospitals were included in this study. On day 1, 56 patients with ARDS were selected for subgroup analysis, and a modified Poisson regression was performed to identify predictors for the early improvement of ARDS (eiARDS). RESULTS: Chongqing reported a 5.3% case fatality rate for the 75 ICU patients. The median age of these patients was 57 (IQR 25-75) years, and no bias was present in the sex ratio. A total of 93% (n=70) of patients developed ARDS during ICU stay, and more than half had moderate ARDS. However, most patients (n=41, 55%) underwent high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy, but not mechanical ventilation. Nearly one-third of patients with ARDS improved (arterial blood oxygen partial pressure/oxygen concentration >300 mm Hg) in 1 week, which was defined as eiARDS. Patients with eiARDS had a higher survival rate and a shorter length of ICU stay than those without eiARDS. Age (<55 years) was the only variable independently associated with eiARDS, with a risk ratio of 2.67 (95% CI 1.17-6.08). CONCLUSIONS: A new subphenotype of ARDS-eiARDS-in patients with COVID-19 was identified. As clinical outcomes differ, the stratified management of patients based on eiARDS or age is highly recommended.","Zhan, Zhu; Yang, Xin; Du, Hu; Zhang, Chuanlai; Song, Yuyan; Ran, Xiaoyun; Zhang, An; Yang, Mei",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,273

Despite the global rollout of vaccinations and promising preliminary results, the focus remains on additional preventive measures to manage COVID-19. Results conflict on vitamin D's plausible role in preventing and treating COVID-19. We examined the relation between vitamin D status and COVID-19 severity and mortality among the multiethnic population of the United Arab Emirates. Our observational study used data for 522 participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at one of the main hospitals in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. Only 464 of those patients were included for data analysis. Demographic and clinical data were retrospectively analyzed. Serum samples immediately drawn at the first hospital visit were used to measure serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations through automated electrochemiluminescence. Levels < 12 ng/mL were significantly associated with higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection and of death. Age was the only other independent risk factor, whereas comorbidities and smoking did not contribute to the outcomes upon adjustment. Sex of patients was not an important predictor for severity or death. Our study is the first conducted in the UAE to measure 25(OH)D levels in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients and confirm the association of levels < 12 ng/mL with COVID-19 severity and mortality.","AlSafar, Habiba; Grant, William B; Hijazi, Rafiq; Uddin, Maimunah; Alkaabi, Nawal; Tay, Guan; Mahboub, Bassam; Al Anouti, Fatme",Nutrients,,273

Given the challenges in implementing widespread SARS-CoV-2 testing, there is increasing interest in alternative surveillance strategies. METHODS: We tested nasopharyngeal swabs from 1094 decedents in the Wayne County Medical Examiner's office for SARS-CoV-2. All decedents were assessed by a COVID-19 checklist, and decedents flagged by the checklist (298) were preferentially tested. A random sample of decedents not flagged by the checklist were also tested (796). We statistically analyzed the characteristics of decedents (age, sex, race, and manner of death), differentiating between those flagged by the checklist and not and between those SARS-CoV-2 positive and not. RESULTS: A larger percentage of decedents overall were male (70% vs 48%) and Black (55% vs 36%) compared to the catchment population. Seven-day average percent positivity among flagged decedents closely matched the trajectory of percent positivity in the catchment population, particularly during the peak of the outbreak (March and April). After a lull in May to mid-June, new positive tests in late June coincided with increased case detection in the catchment. We found large racial disparities in test results: despite no statistical difference in the racial distribution between those flagged and not, SARS-CoV-2 positive decedents were substantially more likely to be Black (82% vs 51%). SARS-CoV-2 positive decedents were also more likely to be older and to have died of natural causes, including of COVID-19 disease. CONCLUSIONS: Disease surveillance through medical examiners and coroners could supplement other forms of surveillance and may serve as a possible early outbreak warning sign.","Brouwer, Andrew F; Myers, Jeffrey L; Martin, Emily T; Konopka, Kristine E; Lauring, Adam S; Eisenberg, Marisa C; Lephart, Paul R; Nguyen, Teresa; Jaworski, Andrea; Schmidt, Carl J",Clin. infect. dis,,273

Limited information exists in Tanzania on antimicrobial resistance surveillance to delineate the potential sources of multi-drug-resistant bacteria for specific mitigation strategies among orthopaedic patients. Methods: A longitudinal study was conducted at Bugando Medical Centre in Mwanza city between January and May 2020. It involved the collection of rectal swabs/stools, hand swabs, and environmental sampling to identify extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing gram-negative bacteria. Participants ' data were collected using a structured questionnaire and analysed to determine factors associated with ESBL colonization among index orthopaedic patients and correlates with other ESBL sources using OR (95% CI) and a cut-off p-value of &lt;=0.05. Results: We found that 47.2% (125/265) of index patients, 77.8% (14/18) of neighbouring patients, 8.3% (2/24) of health-care workers, 72.2% (13/18) of non-medical caregivers, and 31.4% (27/86) of samples taken from the hospital environment had ESBL producers. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. predominated among participants and Acinetobacter spp. predominated in the environmental samples. Patients with open fractures had increased odds of being colonized with ESBL producers [OR (95% CI): 2.08 (1.16-3.75);p=0.015]. The floor below patients' beds was commonly contaminated;however, the odds of environmental contamination decreased on the third round of sampling [OR (95% CI: 0.16 (0.04-0.67);p=0.012], apparently as a result of parallel infection prevention and control responsive measures against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Conclusion: We found a high occurrence of ESBL colonization among participants and in the environmentat this tertiary hospital.

358767,Nutritional challenges in older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have excellent systemic activity and are standard first line treatment in EGFR/ALK wild type metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, their role in patients with brain metastases, which affects over 20% of patients and cause significant morbidity, is less clear. METHODS: We reviewed patients with EGFR/ALK wild-type mNSCLC with CNS metastases. Serial MRIs were reviewed to determine the time to intracranial progression (iPFS). Multivariate regression was performed to adjust for the disease-specific graded prognostic score (ds-GPA). RESULTS: We identified 36 ICI- and 33 chemotherapy-treated patients with baseline CNS metastases and available serial MRIs (average frequency:3.5 months). Baseline radiation was given except for 2 chemotherapy-treated patients with asymptomatic solitary metastasis. The CNS burden of disease was higher in the ICI-treated group (ICI:22% vs. chemotherapy:0% had >10 lesions; p = 0.02), but the utilization of WBRT was not (ICI:31% vs. chemotherapy:45%; p = 0.09). At the time of progression, CNS involvement was identified in 30 % of ICI-treated patients compared to 64 % of chemotherapy controls (p = 0.02). ICI-treated patients had superior iPFS (13.5 vs 8.4 months) that remained significant in multivariate analysis (HR 1.9; 95%CI 1.1--3.4).

359484,"Risk Perception of COVID-19, Meaning-Based Resources and Psychological Well-Being amongst Healthcare Personnel: The Mediating Role of Coping",2020,"The emergence and quick spread of SARS-CoV-2 has pointed at a low capacity response for testing large populations in many countries, in line of material, technical and staff limitations. The traditional RT-qPCR diagnostic test remains the reference method and is by far the most widely used test. These assays are limited to a few probe sets, require large sample PCR reaction volumes, along with an expensive and time-consuming RNA extraction step. Here we describe a quantitative nanofluidic assay that overcomes some of these shortcomings, based on the BiomarkTM instrument from Fluidigm. This system offers the possibility of performing 4608 qPCR end-points in a single run, equivalent to 192 clinical samples combined with 12 pairs of primers/probe sets in duplicate, thus allowing the monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 including the detection of specific SARS-CoV-2 variants, as well as the detection other pathogens and/or host cellular responses (virus receptors, response markers, microRNAs). The 10 nL-range volume of BiomarkTM reactions is compatible with sensitive and reproducible reactions that can be easily and cost-effectively adapted to various RT-qPCR configurations and sets of primers/probe. Finally, we also evaluated the use of inactivating lysis buffers composed of various detergents in the presence or absence of proteinase K to assess the compatibility of these buffers with a direct reverse transcription enzymatic step and we propose several protocols, bypassing the need for RNA purification. We advocate that the combined utilization of an optimized processing buffer and a high-throughput real-time PCR device would contribute to improve the turn-around-time to deliver the test results to patients and increase the SARS-CoV-2 testing capacities.","Fassy, Julien; Lacoux, Caroline; Leroy, Sylvie; Noussair, Latifa; Hubac, Sylvain; Degoutte, Aurélien; Vassaux, Georges; Leclercq, Vianney; Rouquié, David; Marquette, Charles-Hugo; Rottman, Martin; Touron, Patrick; Lemoine, Antoinette; Herrmann, Jean-Louis; Barbry, Pascal; Nahon, Jean-Louis; Zaragosi, Laure-Emmanuelle; Mari, Bernard",PLoS One,,273

362002,Mobile health intervention and COVID-19 pandemic outbreak: insights from Indian context,2020,"The current study examined anxiety and distress among members of the first community to be quarantined in the USA due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to being historically significant, the current sample was unusual in that those quarantined were all members of a Modern Orthodox Jewish community and were connected via religious institutions at which exposure may have occurred. We sought to explore the community and religious factors unique to this sample, as they relate to the psychological and public health impact of quarantine. Community organizations were trusted more than any other source of COVID-19-related information, including federal, state and other government agencies, including the CDC, WHO and media news sources. This was supported qualitatively with open-ended responses in which participants described the range of supports organized by community organizations. These included tangible needs (i.e., food delivery), social support, virtual religious services, and dissemination of COVID-19-related information. The overall levels of distress and anxiety were elevated and directly associated with what was reported to be largely inadequate and inconsistent health-related information received from local departments of health. In addition, the majority of participants felt that perception of or concern about future stigma related to a COVID-19 diagnosis or association of COVID-19 with the Jewish community was high and also significantly predicted distress and anxiety. The current study demonstrates the ways in which religious institutions can play a vital role in promoting the well-being of their constituents. During this unprecedented pandemic, public health authorities have an opportunity to form partnerships with religious institutions in the common interests of promoting health, relaying accurate information and supporting the psychosocial needs of community members, as well as protecting communities against stigma and discrimination.","Weinberger-Litman, Sarah L; Litman, Leib; Rosen, Zohn; Rosmarin, David H; Rosenzweig, Cheskie",J Relig Health,,273

Both central and peripheral nervous system involvement has been reported including headache, dizziness, hyposmia/anosmia, taste disturbances, seizures, stroke, alteration of the sensorium, and even acute hemorrhagic necrotizing leukoencephalopathy. Varying degrees of olfactory disturbances may pre-empt the diagnosis of COVID-19. Although no direct effect of 2019 nCoV has been reported yet on Parkinson's disease, there are enormous possible indirect effects and implications. We examine the potential effects and challenges posed by this pandemic to individuals with Parkinson's disease, particularly in the Indian context where telecommunication access or support group access may be lacking for these patients. Additionally, lockdown and social distancing may pose hurdles in the provision of optimum medical therapy, particularly if patients experience motor and non-motor deteriorations due to diverse reasons.","Garg, Divyani; Dhamija, Rajinder K.",Ann.

362327,Reentry Reflections: Views on COVID-19 From a Global Health Trainee,2020,"BACKGROUND: In a hospital setting, there is a need for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 to guide isolation measures and targeted admission. AIM: First, we evaluated the diagnostic performance of five SARS-CoV-2 rapid nucleocapsid protein antigen detection (RAD) assays (Biosynex, Biotical, Orient Gene, Panbio, SD Biosensor). Secondly, we described the performance and impact of the implementation of the SD Biosensor assay at our emergency department. METHODS: Sensitivity and specificity of the five RAD assays were analyzed on 100 respiratory samples: 60 real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive samples, 24 SARS-CoV-2 RNA negative samples and 16 samples positive for other respiratory pathogens. We adapted the manufacturer's protocol, to validate the antigen tests on transport media used for rRT-PCR in our routine practice. The SD Biosensor RAD assay was implemented as screening method for rapid diagnosis and targeted admission. FINDINGS: Sensitivity of the included RAD assays ranged from 88.9% to 100% for samples with Ct <26, specificity from 46.2% to 100%. During the implementation period, 4195 RAD tests were performed. Due to the rapid RAD result, 157 patients were transferred directly to the COVID-19 cohort instead of the regular ward (n=47) or the temporary COVID-19 ward (n=110). CONCLUSION: The SD Biosensor, Biotical and Panbio SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests had an acceptable overall performance and seem to be able to detect most of the contagious patients. In the context of high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2, RAD tests can be used as a rapid screening tool, to guide infection prevention measures and aid targeted admission.","Van Honacker, Eveline; Van Vaerenbergh, Kristien; Boel, An; De Beenhouwer, Hans; Leroux-Roels, Isabel; Cattoir, Lien",J. hosp. infect,,273

364396,Emergency preparedness and response (EP&R) by pharmacy professionals in India: Lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic and the way forward,2020,"BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous disease characterized by frequent exacerbation phenotypes independent of disease stage. Increasing evidence shows that the microbiota plays a role in disease progression and severity, but long-term and international multicenter assessment of the variations in viral and bacterial communities as drivers of exacerbations are lacking. METHODS: Two-hundred severe COPD patients from Europe and North America were followed longitudinally for 3 years. We performed nucleic acid detection for 20 respiratory viruses and 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing to evaluate the bacterial microbiota in 1179 sputum samples collected at stable, acute exacerbation and follow-up visits. RESULTS: Similar viral and bacterial taxa were found in patients from the USA compared to Bulgaria and Czech Republic but their microbiome diversity was significantly different (P < 0.001) and did not impact exacerbation rates. Virus infection was strongly associated with exacerbation events (P < 5E-20). Human rhinovirus (13.1%), coronavirus (5.1%) and influenza virus (3.6%) constitute the top viral pathogens in triggering exacerbation. Moraxella and Haemophilus were 5-fold and 1.6-fold more likely to be the dominating microbiota during an exacerbation event. Presence of Proteobacteria such as Pseudomonas or Staphylococcus amongst others, were associated with exacerbation events (OR > 0.17; P < 0.02) but more strongly associated with exacerbation frequency (OR > 0.39; P < 4E-10), as confirmed by longitudinal variations and biotyping of the bacterial microbiota, and suggesting a role of the microbiota in sensitizing the lung. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights bacterial taxa in lung sensitization and viral triggers in COPD exacerbations. It provides a global overview of the diverse targets for drug development and explores new microbiome analysis methods to guide future patient management applications.","Bouquet, Jerome; Tabor, David E; Silver, Jonathan S; Nair, Varsha; Tovchigrechko, Andrey; Griffin, M Pamela; Esser, Mark T; Sellman, Bret R; Jin, Hong",Respir Res,,273

In this study (N = 263), we examined the role of personality traits (i.e., Big Five and Dark Triad) and individual differences in perceptions of the COVID-19 pandemic situation (the situational eight: Duty, Intellect, Adversity, Mating, Positivity, Negativity, Deception, and Sociality) in accounting for individual differences in compliance with the governmental restrictions in Poland. We found that the way people perceived the situation explained more variance in compliance than personality traits which is in accordance with the hypothesis that strong situations, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, leave less room for dispositional tendencies in predicting behaviors than situational cues. Moreover, people scoring low on agreeableness and high on aspects of the Dark Triad traits (i.e., Machiavellianism, psychopathy Factor 1, and narcissistic rivalry) were less likely to comply with the restrictions. Additionally, we replicated and extended what is known about the associations between personality and individual differences in the perception of situations when the latter were assessed in relation to a strong situation and the former were assessed with long and multidimensional measures.","Zajenkowski, Marcin; Jonason, Peter K.; Leniarska, Maria; Kozakiewicz, Zuzanna",Pers.

A collective and coordinated national economic and social reconstruction effort aimed at shoring up services to promote children's MEB, like the Marshall Plan that helped rebuild Europe post-World War II, has been proposed to buttress against the expected retrenchment. The plan prioritizes children's well-being as a social objective. We propose strategically reconstructing the public safety-net systems serving youth, including early education, maternal and child health, child welfare, corrections, and mental health. That plan called for a concentrated focus on coalition-building and contracting by state mental health systems to establish a foundation for an improved health system. This paper offers a complementary set of suggestions for the four non-mental health systems mentioned above by recommending actionable steps based on scientific evidence to support improved services for children at risk for MEB problems. For each system we describe examples of evidence-informed services, policies or programs that (1) prevent disabilities and promote health, (2) protect and preserve families and neighborhoods, and (3) provide quality care. Prioritizing the promotion of children's MEB health by all state systems can shape U.S. children's health and well-being for generations to come.","Hoagwood, Kimberly Eaton; Gardner, William; Kelleher, Kelly J",Adm Policy Ment Health,,273

Currently there is no antiviral treatment recommended against SARS-CoV-2. Identifying effective antiviral drugs is urgently required. Methylene blue has already demonstrated in vitro antiviral activity in photodynamic therapy as well as antibacterial, antifungal and antiparasitic activities in non-photodynamic assays. In this study. non-photoactivated methylene blue showed in vitro activity at very low micromolar range with an EC50 (median effective concentration) of 0.30 ± 0.03 µM and an EC90 (90% effective concentration) of 0.75 ± 0.21 µM at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.25 against SARS-CoV-2 (strain IHUMI-3). The EC50 and EC90 values for methylene blue are lower than those obtained for hydroxychloroquine (1.5 µM and 3.0 µM) and azithromycin (20.1 µM and 41.9 µM). The ratios Cmax/EC50 and Cmax/EC90 in blood for methylene blue were estimated at 10.1 and 4.0, respectively, following oral administration and 33.3 and 13.3 following intravenous administration. Methylene blue EC50 and EC90 values are consistent with concentrations observed in human blood. We propose that methylene blue is a promising drug for treatment of COVID-19. In vivo evaluation in animal experimental models is now required to confirm its antiviral effects on SARS-CoV-2. The potential interest of methylene blue to treat COVID-19 needs to be confirmed by prospective comparative clinical studies.","Gendrot, Mathieu; Andreani, Julien; Duflot, Isabelle; Boxberger, Manon; Le Bideau, Marion; Mosnier, Joel; Jardot, Priscilla; Fonta, Isabelle; Rolland, Clara; Bogreau, Hervé; Hutter, Sébastien; La Scola, Bernard; Pradines, Bruno",Int J Antimicrob Agents,,273

374046,When fear and misinformation go viral: Pharmacists' role in deterring medication misinformation during the 'infodemic' surrounding COVID-19,2020,"There are questions and challenges regarding neurologic complications in COVID-19 patients. EEG is a safe and efficient tool for the evaluation of brain function, even in the context of COVID-19. However, EEG technologists should not be put in danger if obtaining an EEG does not significantly advance diagnosis or change management in the patient. Not every neurologic problem stems from a primary brain injury: confusion, impaired consciousness that evolves to stupor and coma, and headaches are frequent in hypercapnic/hypoxic encephalopathies. In patients with chronic pulmonary disorders, acute symptomatic seizures have been reported in acute respiratory failure in 6%. The clinician should be aware of the various EEG patterns in hypercapnic/hypoxic and anoxic (post-cardiac arrest syndrome) encephalopathies as well as encephalitides. In this emerging pandemic of infectious disease, reduced EEG montages using single-use subdermal EEG needle electrodes may be used in comatose patients. A full 10-20 EEG complement of electrodes with an ECG derivation remains the standard. Under COVID-19 conditions, an expedited study that adequately screens for generalized status epilepticus, most types of regional status epilepticus, encephalopathy or sleep may serve for most clinical questions, using simplified montages may limit the risk of infection to EEG technologists. We recommend noting whether the patient is undergoing or has been placed prone, as well as noting the body and head position during the EEG recording (supine versus prone) to avoid overinterpretation of respiratory, head movement, electrode, muscle or other artifacts. There is slight elevation of intracranial pressure in the prone position. In non-comatose patients, the hyperventilation procedure should be avoided. At present, non-specific EEG findings and abnormalities should not be considered as being specific for COVID-19 related encephalopathy.","Gélisse, Philippe; Rossetti, Andrea O; Genton, Pierre; Crespel, Arielle; Kaplan, Peter W",Clin Neurophysiol,,273

This study aimed to help inform triage guidance by exploring the views of lay people about factors to include in triage decisions. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Online survey between 29th of May and 22nd of June 2020 based on hypothetical triage dilemmas. Participants recruited from existing market research panels, representative of the UK general population. Scenarios were presented in which a single ventilator is available, and two patients require ICU admission and ventilation. Patients differed in one of: chance of survival, life expectancy, age, expected length of treatment, disability and degree of frailty. Respondents were given the option of choosing one patient to treat or tossing a coin to decide. RESULTS: Seven hundred and sixty-three participated. A majority of respondents prioritised patients who would have a higher chance of survival (72%-93%), longer life expectancy (78%-83%), required shorter duration of treatment (88%-94%), were younger (71%-79%) or had a lesser degree of frailty (60%-69%, all p<0.001). Where there was a small difference between two patients, a larger proportion elected to toss a coin to decide which patient to treat. A majority (58%-86%) were prepared to withdraw treatment from a patient in intensive care who had a lower chance of survival than another patient currently presenting with COVID-19. Respondents also indicated a willingness to give higher priority to healthcare workers and to patients with young children. CONCLUSION: Members of the UK general public potentially support a broadly utilitarian approach to ICU triage in the face of overwhelming need. Survey respondents endorsed the relevance of patient factors currently included in triage guidance, but also factors not currently included. They supported the permissibility of reallocating treatment in a pandemic.","Wilkinson, Dominic; Zohny, Hazem; Kappes, Andreas; Sinnott-Armstrong, Walter; Savulescu, Julian",BMJ Open,,273

Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used to compare variables with the development of new-onset headaches. Chi-squared test was also performed between demographic data and other factors that may be causing new-onset headaches. A p-value < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: A total of 241 healthcare workers participated, of which 68 participants (28.2%) reported de novo headaches since the start of the pandemic. Incidence of pre-existing headaches (odds ratio [OR] = 1.91; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.99-0.37; p = 0.049) was associated with new-onset headaches. Post hoc multivariable logistic regression analysis stated that incidence of pre-existing headaches (OR = 1.88; 95% CI: 0.94-3.78; p = 0.75) and age (OR = 2.21; 95% CI: 0.47-10.33; p = 0.36) was independently associated with new-onset PPE-induced headaches but was not statistically significant. Chi-squared analysis showed a statistically significant relationship between other factors (sleep deprivation, emotional stress, etc.) and department of activity, gender, and occupation (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Healthcare workers with previous history of pre-existing headaches were found to be more susceptible to PPE-induced headaches during COVID-19 pandemic. However, age and the department where the healthcare workers performed may also be risk factors.","Zaheer, Rumeesha; Khan, Maheen; Tanveer, Ahmed; Farooq, Amal; Khurshid, Zohaib",European journal of dentistry,,273

To evaluate the associated factors involved in these variants. Methods: between May/June of 2020, it was conducted a prospective cross-section study with symptomatic participants for COVID-19 (n=300). It was applied an online questionnaire and the DASS-21 to evaluate the mental health of participants. Results: it was observed that 28.6%, 29.7% and 27% of the participants showed severe/extreme levels symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression, respectively. The testing for COVID-19 application had constituted a protective factor for the development of psychiatric morbidity, once it had shown significant association in the low frequencies of severe/extreme depression [Odds Ratio (OR)]= 0.26; p=0.002) and stress (OR=0.39; p=0.01). Conclusion: individuals that are symptomatic for COVID-19 are a vulnerable group that may present high symptomatology for depression, anxiety, and stress. The identification of psychiatric morbidity frequency and its associated factors may contribute for the development of mental health strategies aiming at the prevention and mitigation of psychological impact in COVID-19 symptomatic population during the pandemic.","Santos, Alan Chaves dos; Tenorio, Paula Jaeger; Barbosa, Elias Almeida S.; Souza, Gustavo Fonseca de Albuquerque; Souza, Gabriela Albuquerque; Praciano, Gabriella de Almeida Figueredo; Maranhão, Laura Brito Barreto; Costa, Gabriela Oliveira Lobo Pereira da; Souza, Alex Sandro Rolland",Rev.

377301,A Survey of Mental Health in Graduate Nursing Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Recent increases in marijuana use and legalization without adequate knowledge of the risks necessitate the characterization of the billions of nanoparticles contained in each puff of smoke. Tobacco smoke offers a benchmark given that it has been extensively studied. Tobacco and marijuana smoke particles are quantitatively similar in volatility, shape, density and number concentration, albeit with differences in size, total mass and chemical composition. Particles from marijuana smoke are on average 29% larger in mobility diameter than particles from tobacco smoke and contain 3.4× more total mass. New measurements of semi-volatile fractions determine over 97% of the mass and volume of the particles from either smoke source are comprised of semi-volatile compounds. For tobacco and marijuana smoke, respectively, 4350 and 2575 different compounds are detected, of which, 670 and 536 (231 in common) are tentatively identified, and of these, 173 and 110 different compounds (69 in common) are known to cause negative health effects through carcinogenic, mutagenic, teratogenic, or other toxic mechanisms. This study demonstrates striking similarities between marijuana and tobacco smoke in terms of their physical and chemical properties.","Graves, Brian M; Johnson, Tyler J; Nishida, Robert T; Dias, Ryan P; Savareear, Benjamin; Harynuk, James J; Kazemimanesh, Mohsen; Olfert, Jason S; Boies, Adam M",Sci Rep,,273

380676,Psychological Well-being during Covid-19 Lockdown: Insights from a Saudi State University's Academic Community,2020,"BACKGROUND: During the recent COVID-19 outbreak, masks became mandatory and shortages frequent, therefore the prevalence of non-CE (European Conformity Mark) approved masks increased in the general population. We aimed to quantify the prevalence of mask-related cutaneous side effects and the differences between CE and non-CE approved masks. METHODS: In this multicenter prospective observational study conducted from March 20, 2020 to May 12, 2020(during and after quarantine), patients attending emergency departments for a dermatological consult were clinically assessed and their masks were inspected to detect CE marks and UNI (Italian National Unification Entity) norms. Patients with history of facial dermatoses or under current treatment for facial dermatoses were excluded. RESULTS: We enrolled 412 patients (318 during quarantine and 94 after quarantine). CE-approved masks were observed 52.8% vs. 24.5%, whilst subsets of non-CE approved masks were 9.7% vs. 14.9% (Personal protective equipment (PPE)-masks), 16.4% vs. 12.8% (surgical masks [SM]), and 21.1% vs. 47.9%(non-PPE) and (non-SM masks), respectively during and after quarantine. Remarkably, non-CE-approved masks resulted in patients displaying a statistically significant higher incidence of facial dermatoses and irritant contact dermatitis compared to CE-approved masks, and these differences were mainly driven by non-PPE non-SM masks. Comparing quarantine and after quarantine periods, no statistically significant differences were found for CE-approved masks, whilst differences were detected in non-CE-approved masks regarding incidence of facial dermatoses (P<0.0001)and irritant contact dermatitis (P=0.0041). CONCLUSIONS: Masks are essential to prevent COVID-19 but at the same time higher awareness regarding mask specifications should be promoted in the general population. Non-PPE and non-SM masks should undergo more rigorous testing to prevent the occurrence of cutaneous side effects and future patients' lawsuit damages.","Damiani, Giovanni; Gironi, Laura C; Pacifico, Alessia; Cristaudo, Antonio; Malagoli, Piergiorgio; Allocco, Francesca; Bragazzi, Nicola L; Linder, Dennis M; Santus, Pierachille; Buja, Alessandra; Savoia, Paola; Pigatto, Paolo Dm",Ital J Dermatol Venerol,,273
381410,Health systems resilience in managing the COVID-19 pandemic: lessons from 28 countries,2021,"BACKGROUND: Initial training is essential for the mental health peer support worker (PSW) role. Training needs to incorporate recent advances in digital peer support and the increase of peer support work roles internationally. There is a lack of evidence on training topics that are important for initial peer support work training and on which training topics can be provided on the internet. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to establish consensus levels about the content of initial training for mental health PSWs and the extent to which each identified topic can be delivered over the internet. METHODS: A systematized review was conducted to identify a preliminary list of training topics from existing training manuals. Three rounds of Delphi consultation were then conducted to establish the importance and web-based deliverability of each topic. In round 1, participants were asked to rate the training topics for importance, and the topic list was refined. In rounds 2 and 3, participants were asked to rate each topic for importance and the extent to which they could be delivered over the internet. RESULTS: The systematized review identified 32 training manuals from 14 countries: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Scotland, Sweden, Uganda, the United Kingdom, and the United States. These were synthesized to develop a preliminary list of 18 topics. The Delphi consultation involved 110 participants (49 PSWs, 36 managers, and 25 researchers) from 21 countries (14 high-income, 5 middle-income, and 2 low-income countries). After the Delphi consultation (round 1: n=110; round 2: n=89; and round 3: n=82), 20 training topics (18 universal and 2 context-specific) were identified. There was a strong consensus about the importance of five topics: lived experience as an asset, ethics, PSW well-being, and PSW role focus on recovery and communication, with a moderate consensus for all other topics apart from the knowledge of mental health. There was no clear pattern of differences among PSW, manager, and researcher ratings of importance or between responses from participants in countries with different resource levels. All training topics were identified with a strong consensus as being deliverable through blended web-based and face-to-face training (rating 1) or fully deliverable on the internet with moderation (rating 2), with none identified as only deliverable through face-to-face teaching (rating 0) or deliverable fully on the web as a stand-alone course without moderation (rating 3). CONCLUSIONS: The 20 training topics identified can be recommended for inclusion in the curriculum of initial training programs for PSWs. Further research on web-based delivery of initial training is needed to understand the role of web-based moderation and whether web-based training better prepares recipients to deliver web-based peer support.","Charles, Ashleigh; Nixdorf, Rebecca; Ibrahim, Nashwa; Meir, Lion Gai; Mpango, Richard S; Ngakongwa, Fileuka; Nudds, Hannah; Pathare, Soumitra; Ryan, Grace; Repper, Julie; Wharrad, Heather; Wolf, Philip; Slade, Mike; Mahlke, Candelaria",JMIR Ment Health,,273

To this point, the extent of this psychological burden, especially in Europe and Germany, remains unclear. This is the first study investigating German HPs after the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: We performed an online-based cross-sectional study after the COVID-19 outbreak in Germany (10-31 March 2020). In total, 2224 HPs (physicians n = 492, nursing staff n = 1511, paramedics n = 221) and 10 639 non-healthcare professionals (nHPs) were assessed including generalized anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-2), current health status (EQ-5D-3L), COVID-19-related fear, subjective level of information regarding COVID-19. RESULTS: HPs showed less generalized anxiety, depression and COVID-19-related fear and higher health status and subjective level of information regarding COVID-19 than the nHPs. Within the HP groups, nursing staff were the most psychologically burdened. Subjective levels of information regarding COVID-19 correlated negatively with generalized anxiety levels across all groups. Among HPs, nursing staff showed the highest and paramedics the lowest generalized anxiety levels. CONCLUSIONS: In the context of COVID-19, German HPs seem to be less psychological burdened than nHPs, and also less burdened compared with existing international data.","Skoda, Eva-Maria; Teufel, Martin; Stang, Andreas; Jöckel, Karl-Heinz; Junne, Florian; Weismüller, Benjamin; Hetkamp, Madeleine; Musche, Venja; Kohler, Hannah; Dörrie, Nora; Schweda, Adam; Bäuerle, Alexander",J Public Health (Oxf),,273

The impact of such closures on automated external defibrillator (AED) accessibility compared to changes in foot traffic levels is unknown. METHODS: We identified all publicly available online AED registries in Canada last updated May 1, 2019 or later. We mapped AED locations to location types and classified each location type as completely inaccessible, partially inaccessible, or unaffected based on government-issued closure orders as of May 1, 2020. Using location and mobility data from Google's COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports, we identified the change in foot traffic levels between February 15-May 1, 2020 (excluding April 10-12) compared to the baseline of January 3-February 1, 2020, and determined the discrepancy between foot traffic levels and AED accessibility. RESULTS: We identified four provincial and two municipal AED registries containing a total of 5848 AEDs. Of those, we estimated that 69.9% were completely inaccessible, 18.8% were partially inaccessible, and 11.3% were unaffected. Parks, retail and recreation locations, and workplaces experienced the greatest reduction in AED accessibility. The greatest discrepancies between foot traffic levels and AED accessibility occurred in parks, retail and recreation locations, and transit stations. CONCLUSION: A majority of AEDs became inaccessible during the COVID-19 pandemic due to government-mandated closures. In a substantial number of locations across Canada, the reduction in AED accessibility was far greater than the reduction in foot traffic.","Leung, K H Benjamin; Alam, Rejuana; Brooks, Steven C; Chan, Timothy C Y",Resuscitation,,273

Recently, BTK inhibitors acalabrutinib and ibrutinib have been found to protect against pulmonary injury in a small group of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines found in the circulation of COVID-19 patients with severe lung disease suggest the involvement of the innate immune system in this process. Understanding the potential mechanism of action of BTK inhibition in SARS-CoV-2 is clearly of importance to determine how acalabrutinib, ibrutinib and possibly other BTK inhibitors may provide protection against lung injury.","Benner, Brooke; Carson, William E",J Hematol Oncol,,273

386522,Africa's COVID-19 health technologies' watershed moment,2020,"BACKGROUND: The mainstay of control of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic is vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Within a year, several vaccines have been developed and millions of doses delivered. Reporting of adverse events is a critical postmarketing activity. METHODS: We report findings in 23 patients who presented with thrombosis and thrombocytopenia 6 to 24 days after receiving the first dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (AstraZeneca). On the basis of their clinical and laboratory features, we identify a novel underlying mechanism and address the therapeutic implications. RESULTS: In the absence of previous prothrombotic medical conditions, 22 patients presented with acute thrombocytopenia and thrombosis, primarily cerebral venous thrombosis, and 1 patient presented with isolated thrombocytopenia and a hemorrhagic phenotype. All the patients had low or normal fibrinogen levels and elevated d-dimer levels at presentation. No evidence of thrombophilia or causative precipitants was identified. Testing for antibodies to platelet factor 4 (PF4) was positive in 21 patients, negative in 1 patient, and equivocal in 1 patient. On the basis of the pathophysiological features observed in these patients, we recommend that treatment with platelet transfusions be avoided because of the risk of progression in thrombotic symptoms and that the administration of a nonheparin anticoagulant agent and intravenous immune globulin be considered for the first occurrence of these symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 remains critical for control of the Covid-19 pandemic. A pathogenic PF4-dependent syndrome, unrelated to the use of heparin therapy, can occur after the administration of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. Rapid identification of this rare syndrome is important because of the therapeutic implications.","Scully, Marie; Singh, Deepak; Lown, Robert; Poles, Anthony; Solomon, Tom; Levi, Marcel; Goldblatt, David; Kotoucek, Pavel; Thomas, William; Lester, William",N.

387081,Foregrounding Context in the COVID-19 Pandemic: Learning from Older Adults in Puerto Rico,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The suspension of elective surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented and has resulted in record volumes of patients waiting for operations. Novel approaches that maximise capacity and efficiency of surgical care are urgently required. This study applies Markov multiscale community detection (MMCD), an unsupervised graph-based clustering framework, to identify new surgical care models based on pooled waiting-lists delivered across an expanded network of surgical providers. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study using Hospital Episode Statistics. SETTING: Public and private hospitals providing surgical care to National Health Service (NHS) patients in England. PARTICIPANTS: All adult patients resident in England undergoing NHS-funded planned surgical procedures between 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2018. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The identification of the most common planned surgical procedures in England (high-volume procedures (HVP)) and proportion of low, medium and high-risk patients undergoing each HVP. The mapping of hospitals providing surgical care onto optimised groupings based on patient usage data. RESULTS: A total of 7 811 891 planned operations were identified in 4 284 925 adults during the 1-year period of our study. The 28 most common surgical procedures accounted for a combined 3 907 474 operations (50.0% of the total). 2 412 613 (61.7%) of these most common procedures involved 'low risk' patients. Patients travelled an average of 11.3 km for these procedures. Based on the data, MMCD partitioned England into 45, 16 and 7 mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive natural surgical communities of increasing coarseness. The coarser partitions into 16 and seven surgical communities were shown to be associated with balanced supply and demand for surgical care within communities. CONCLUSIONS: Pooled waiting-lists for low-risk elective procedures and patients across integrated, expanded natural surgical community networks have the potential to increase efficiency by innovatively flexing existing supply to better match demand.","Clarke, Jonathan; Murray, Alice; Markar, Sheraz Rehan; Barahona, Mauricio; Kinross, James",BMJ Open,,273

387612,COVID-19: A junior doctor's reflections,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to reveal how the pandemic process affected the number of ED visits and the reasons for application. METHODS: The daily number of ED visits during the pandemic were analyzed in 3 different periods; prepandemic period (February 1st to March 11th, declaration of the first COVID-19 case in Turkey), early pandemic period (March 12th to May 31th, period of strict measures), and late pandemic period (June 1st to July 31st, period of new norms). The pandemic periods were compared with the same timeframes in 2019 (comparison periods). Demographic variables and complaints of the patients on admission were investigated. RESULTS: The total number of ED visits in the study period in 2020 was 78,907, which was only the half of the applications in the same period in 2019 (n: 149,387). Data showed a sharp decrease at the number of daily visits to green and yellow zones after the announcement of the first case however red zone applications were more than twice that of the previous year. During pandemic nonspecific complaints was decreased and there was an increase at the percentages of respiratory, cardiac, and neurological complaints. CONCLUSION: Number of ED visits during the pandemic were decreased by half when compared to the previous year. It was an advantage of the pandemic to decrease ED visits due to ""nonemergent"" complaints, and thus, unnecessary patient burden. However, on the other hand, patients avoided seeking medical attention, even for life-threatening conditions which led to increased mortality and morbidity.","Çikrikçi Isik, Gülsah; Çevik, Yunsur",Am J Emerg Med,,273
387979,Solidarity in the wake of COVID-19: reimagining the International Health Regulations,2020,"We analyze the relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) under an increasing number of vaccinations in Germany. For the spread of SARS-CoV-2 we employ a SIR-type model that accounts for age-dependence and includes realistic contact patterns between age groups. The implementation of NPIs occurs on changed contact patterns, improved isolation, or reduced infectiousness when, e.g., wearing masks. We account for spatial heterogeneity and commuting activities in between regions in Germany, and the testing of commuters is considered as a further NPI. We include the ongoing vaccination process and analyse the effect of the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant, which is considered to be 20% - 60% more infectious then the currently dominant B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant. We explore different opening scenarios under the ongoing vaccination process by assuming that local restrictions are either lifted in early July or August with or without continued wearing of masks and testing. Our results indicate that we can counteract the resurgence of SARS-CoV-2 despite the Delta variant with appropriate timing for the relaxation of NPIs. In all cases, however, school children are hit the hardest. Author summaryOne of the greatest challenges within the Covid-19 pandemic is to identify the timing and amount of non-pharmaceutical interventions (face masks, travel bans, school closures, etc). In the year 2021 more and more people are vaccinated. When can we finally lift all restrictions and stop wearing masks? In order to provide more insights to this question, we use a mathematical model which is capable of simulating the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions in Germany while accounting for age-dependent factors as well as commuting activities between regions. We include the vaccination process and analyse the much more infectious Delta coronavirus variant. We simulate scenarios that consider the timing of the return to pre-pandemic contacts as well as when to suspend wearing masks and testing. Our results show that a later opening by 1 August in combination with masks and testing reduces the chance of a further infection wave considerably. In all of our scenarios, the infection manifests in the younger age groups.","Koslow, Wadim; Kühn, Martin J.; Binder, Sebastian; Klitz, Margrit; Abele, Daniel; Basermann, Achim; Meyer-Hermann, Michael",,,273

The aim of this study was to analyse and report the containment measures' impact on trauma surgery activity during the COVID-19 pandemic in order to quickly react and adjust in case of a new sanitary crisis and containment. METHODS: An original epidemiological study was performed in our trauma centre in France. Data from trauma surgeries performed during the pre-containment (from March 1 to March 16, 2020), containment (from March 17 to April 17, 2020) and reference (from March 1 to April 17, 2019) periods were compared. The primary outcome was the number of patients operated on daily and the daily operating room time. Clinical data, delay for surgery, mechanism of injury and injury pattern were also reviewed. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant decrease in the number of patients operated upon daily (- 39,8%, p value < 0.001) and daily operating room time (- 35.5%, p value < 0.001) between the reference and containment periods and between the pre-containment and containment periods (respectively, - 35.0%, p value < 0.001 and - 28.7%, p value 0.002). No differences were reported between the reference and pre-containment periods for daily-operated patients (p value 0.359). CONCLUSION: Containment measures had a direct impact on trauma surgery activity with a decrease of a third of trauma surgery activity. Those results could be useful if a new containment occurred.","Druel, Thibault; Andeol, Quentin; Rongieras, Frédéric; Bertani, Antoine; Bordes, Maxence; Alvernhe, Agathe",Int Orthop,,273

The most commonly cited reasons for excessive waste were regulatory and manufacturer restrictions on reuse or multiple use of devices, supplies, and pharmaceuticals. More than 90% believed that profit, liability reduction, and failure to consider carbon footprint drive manufacturers to produce more single-use products; more than 90% want more reusable products and more regulatory and manufacturer discretion over when and which products can be reused. Assuming comparable cost, 79% of surgeons preferred reusable over disposable instruments. In order of decreasing consensus, most were interested in reusing topical and intracameral medications, phacoemulsification tips, irrigating solutions/tubing, blades, cannulas, devices, and surgical gowns.","Chang, David F; Thiel, Cassandra L",J Cataract Refract Surg,,273

389993,A case study of a collaborative allied health and nursing crisis response,2020,"Given the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic and the shortage of medical resource, extensive deep learning models have been proposed for automatic COVID-19 diagnosis, based on 3D computed tomography (CT) scans. However, the existing models independently process the 3D lesion segmentation and disease classification, ignoring the inherent correlation between these two tasks. In this paper, we propose a joint deep learning model of 3D lesion segmentation and classification for diagnosing COVID-19, called DeepSC-COVID, as the first attempt in this direction. Specifically, we establish a large-scale CT database containing 1,805 3D CT scans with fine-grained lesion annotations, and reveal 4 findings about lesion difference between COVID-19 and community acquired pneumonia (CAP). Inspired by our findings, DeepSC-COVID is designed with 3 subnets: a cross-task feature subnet for feature extraction, a 3D lesion subnet for lesion segmentation, and a classification subnet for disease diagnosis. Besides, the task-aware loss is proposed for learning the task interaction across the 3D lesion and classification subnets. Different from all existing models for COVID-19 diagnosis, our model is interpretable with fine-grained 3D lesion distribution. Finally, extensive experimental results show that the joint learning framework in our model significantly improves the performance of 3D lesion segmentation and disease classification in both efficiency and efficacy.","Wang, Xiaofei; Jiang, Lai; Li, Liu; Xu, Mai; Deng, Xin; Dai, Lisong; Xu, Xiangyang; Li, Tianyi; Guo, Yichen; Wang, Zulin; Dragotti, Pier Luigi",IEEE. trans. med. imaging,,273

The ProPac-COVID trial evaluates whether combination therapy with macrolide azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine via anti-inflammation/immune modulation, antiviral efficacy, and pre-emptive treatment of supra-infections can shorten hospitalization duration and reduce the risk of non-invasive ventilation, treatment in the intensive care unit, and death in patients with acute hospital admission and a positive test for 2019-nCoV and symptoms of COVID-19 disease. METHODS: The ProPAC-COVID is a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical trial. The primary outcome is number of days spent alive and out of hospital within 14 days from randomization. Randomization will be in blocks of unknown size, and the final allocation will be stratified for age, site of recruitment, and whether the patient has any chronic lung diseases. Data is analyzed using intention-to-treat (ITT) principles, and main analyses will also be subject to modified ITT analysis and per protocol analysis. DISCUSSION: This paper describes the detailed statistical analysis plan for the evaluation of primary and secondary endpoints of the ProPAC-COVID study. Enrolment of patients to the ProPAC-COVID study is still ongoing. The purpose of this paper is to provide primary publication of study results to prevent selective reporting of outcomes, data-driven analysis, and to increase transparency.

390764,COVID-19: digital equivalence of health care in English prisons,2020,"BACKGROUND: Providing high-quality training to residency students during the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been a goal of our institution. Since 2108, we began to take microlectures to students teaching. Microlectures are online presentations, and the microlecture teaching method has many advantages, such as a short teaching time, situational resource composition, diverse communication, strong pertinence and can attend microlectures from home. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the advantages of the microlecture teaching method on students in standardized residency training. METHODS: Students from our department were randomly divided into the traditional teaching group (control group) and the microlecture teaching group (observation group). The teaching duration for both groups was 3 months. All students were assessed on basic knowledge of the neurology before enrollment. After the teaching session, the students were assessed on teaching effect, theoretical operation, and clinical practice satisfaction. The students also evaluated the teachers, and the teachers evaluated the students. RESULTS: A total of 84 students participated in the study and were divided equally into the observation group (42 students) and the control group (42 students). The results showed that the rate of reaching the standard of teaching effect, achievement of theory and operation, satisfaction with clinical practice, the student's grades by teachers, and student satisfaction with teachers were significantly higher in the observation group than in the control group (all P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The microlecture teaching method can effectively improve the clinical teaching effect for neurology students and should be adopted in clinical teaching, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kong, Zhaohong; Li, Tao; Zhang, Zhaohui; Jiang, Jian; Mei, Junhua",Ann Palliat Med,,273

393874,Early assessment of the impact of mitigation measures on the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy,2020,"Despite the societal and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the lockdown measures put in place by the Italian government provided an unprecedented opportunity to increase our knowledge of the effect transportation and industry-related emissions have on the air quality in our cities. This study assessed the effect of reduced emissions during the lockdown period, due to COVID-19, on air quality in three Italian cities, Florence, Pisa, and Lucca. For this study, we compared the concentration of particulate matter PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;, NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; measured during the lockdown period, with values obtained in the same period of 2019. Our results show no evidence of a direct relationship between the lockdown measures implemented and PM reduction in urban centers, except in areas with heavy traffic. Consistent with recently published studies, we did, however, observe a significant decrease in NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations among all the air-monitoring stations for each city in this study. Finally, O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; levels remained unchanged during the lockdown period. Of note, there were slight variations in the meteorological conditions for the same periods of different years. Our results suggest a need for further studies on the impact of vehicular traffic and industrial activities on PM air pollution, including adopting holistic source-control measures for improved air quality in urban environments.","Donzelli, G.; Cioni, L.; Cancellieri, M.; Morales, A.

The COVID-19 pandemic has claimed over 350,000 human lives within five months of its emergence, especially in the USA and the European continent. This study analysed the implications of the genetic diversity and mutations in SARS-CoV-2 on its virulence diversity and investigated how these factors could affect the successful development and application of antiviral chemotherapy and serodiagnostic test kits, and vaccination. Methods: All the suitable and eligible full text articles published between 31st December 2019 and 31st May 2020 were filtered and extracted from ""PubMed"", ""Scopus"", ""Web of Science"", and ""Hinari"" and were critically reviewed. We used the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms ""COVID-19, ""Mutation"", ""Genetic diversity"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""Virulence"", ""Pathogenicity"", ""Evolution"" and ""SARS-CoV-2 transmission"" for this search. Results: Our search showed that SARS-CoV-2 has persistently undergone significant mutations in various parts of its non-structural proteins (NSPs) especially NSP2 and NSP3, S protein, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). In particular, the S protein was found to be the key determinant of evolution, transmission, and virulence of SARS-CoV-2, and could be a potential target for vaccine development. Additionally, RdRp could be a major target in the development of antivirals for the treatment of COVID-19. Conclusion: Given the critical importance of mutations in the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 and in the development of sero-diagnostics, antivirals, and vaccines, this study recommends continuous molecular surveillance of SARS-CoV-2. This approach would potentially prompt identification of new mutants and their impact on ongoing biomedical interventions and COVID-19 control measures.","Abdullahi, Idris N; Emeribe, Anthony U; Ajayi, Onaoluwa A; Oderinde, Bamidele S; Amadu, Dele O; Osuji, Ahaneku I",,,273

On the other hand, higher sedentary time during the pandemic period can have deleterious effects. The objective of this study was to compare physical activity levels, sedentary time, and sleep parameters during the pre-COVID period and the COVID-19 pandemic period in young badminton athletes. Methods: Fifteen young badminton athletes were evaluated during a pre-COVID period (July 2019) and during the COVID-19 period (July 2020). Sleep parameters, physical activity level, and sedentary time were measured using a tri-axial accelerometer. Participants wore the accelerometer on their dominant wrist for 7 days consecutively. In addition, the average of each sleep parameter [time in bed and total sleep time in hours per day, sleep efficiency (%), wake after sleep onset (WASO, total per day), and sleep latency (minutes per day)] was reported over the 7-day period. Results: Athletes presented increased sedentary time (pre-COVID = 7.0 ± 1.1 vs.COVID-19 = 8.9 ± 1.9 h/day, p = 0.004, d = 1.30) and significant decreases in the total PA observed in counts per day (pre-COVID = 2,967,064.4 ± 671,544.1 vs. COVID-19 = 1,868,210.2 ± 449,768.4 counts/day, p = 0.001, d = 1.99), time in vigorous PA (pre-COVID = 7.7 ± 0.9 vs. COVID-19 = 6.1 ± 1.2 h/day, p = 0.001, d = 1.56), and time in moderate-to-vigorous PA (pre-COVID = 8.1 ± 0.9 vs. COVID-19 = 6.5 ± 1.3 h/day, p = 0.001, d = 1.48). There were no significant differences for time in light and moderate PA or in sleep parameters (p > 0.05).

399308,COVID-19 and doctor emigration: the case of Ireland,2021,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The lockdown response to the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted commercial gambling in many jurisdictions around the world. The goal of this review is to systematically identify and describe the survey data and findings to date examining the effect on individual gambling and gambling disorder. RECENT FINDINGS: Of the 17 publications meeting inclusion criteria, the majority reported cross-sectional assessments (nâ=â11, 65%) and remainder were longitudinal in that they had earlier gambling data for participants (nâ=â6, 35%). Not surprisingly given the closure of land-based gambling, an overall reduction in gambling frequency and expenditure was reported in all studies. The estimate of the proportion of participants in both the general population and the population that gambles who increased overall gambling or online gambling was variable. The most consistent correlates of increased gambling during the lockdown were increased problem gambling severity, younger age groups, and being male. SUMMARY: These results suggest that the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on gambling and problematic gambling are diverse - possibly causing a reduction in current or future problems in some, but also promoting increased problematic gambling in others. The longer-term implications of both the reduction in overall gambling, and the increase in some vulnerable groups are unclear, and requires assessment in subsequent follow-up studies. However, in the short term, individuals with existing gambling problems should be recognized as a vulnerable group.","Hodgins, David C; Stevens, Rhys M G",Curr Opin Psychiatry,,273

Methods: Forty COVID-19 patients admitted to the First Ward of Hubei Shiyan Second Medical Treatment Hospital from February 3 to February 6, 2020. Among them, 34 patients were tested for blood lipids before oral lopinavir/ritonavir. The blood lipid changes were observed during the treatment of oral lopinavir/ritonavir. Results: The blood lipid levels of 34 patients who underwent oral lopinavir/ritonavir treatment for 7-10 days were higher than those before treatment with significant difference. Among the 34 patients, fourteen patients showed significantly increased blood lipid levels after oral lopinavir/ritonavir (9-10 days of treatment), and their blood lipid levels were re-assayed 3-5 days after lopinavir/ritonavir discontinuance. The overall levels of triglyceride and cholesterol were still elevated, but the difference was not statistically significant. Conclusion: Lopinavir/ritonavir has a significant effect on blood lipid levels in patients with COVID-19.

400360,Indoor Air Quality and Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19),2020,"Aims: Europe has found itself at the epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic. Naturally, this has placed added strain onto healthcare systems internationally. It was feared that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could overrun the Irish healthcare system. As such, the Irish government opted to introduce a national lockdown on the 27 March 2020 in an attempt to stem the flow of admissions to hospitals. Similar lockdowns in the UK and New Zealand have resulted in reduced emergency department presentations and trauma admissions. The aim of this study is to assess the effect of the national lockdown on trauma presentations to a model-3 hospital in Dublin, Ireland. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted. All emergency department presentations between 27 March 2019 to 27 April 2020 and 27 March 2020 to 27 April 2020 were cross-referenced against the National Integrated Medical Imaging System-Picture Archiving Communication System (NIMIS-PACS) radiology system to identify those with radiologically proven skeletal trauma. These patients were grouped according to sex, age, discharge outcome, mechanism of injury, and injury location. Results: A 21% decrease in radiologically proven trauma was observed on comparison with the same time-period last year. Additionally, a 40% reduction in trauma admissions was observed during the COVID-19 lockdown. A 60% reduction in sports-related injuries and road traffic accident-related injuries was noted during the national lockdown. However, a 17% increase was observed in patients sustaining trauma because of domestic accidents. Conclusion: Variation was observed in both the volume and nature of trauma presentations during the COVID-19 lockdown. As would be expected, a reduction was seen in the number of injuries resulting from outdoor activities. Interestingly, increased rates of domestic injuries were seen during this period which could represent an unintended consequence of the prolonged period of lockdown.Cite this article: Bone Joint Open 2020;1-6:261-266.","Fahy, Stephen; Moore, Joss; Kelly, Michael; Flannery, Olivia; Kenny, Paddy",Bone Jt Open,,273

Aging, Emotion, and Coping During the COVID-19 Pandemic",2021,"SARS-CoV-2 genetic material has been detected in raw wastewater around the world throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and has served as a useful tool for monitoring community levels of SARS-CoV-2 infections. SARS-CoV-2 genetic material is highly detectable in a patients feces and the household wastewater for several days before and after a positive COVID-19 qPCR test from throat or sputum samples. Here, we characterize genetic material collected from raw wastewater samples and determine recovery efficiency during a concentration process. We find that pasteurization of raw wastewater samples did not reduce SARS-CoV-2 signal if RNA is extracted immediately after pasteurization. On the contrary, we find that signal decreased by approximately half when RNA was extracted 24-36 hours post-pasteurization and [~]90% when freeze-thawed prior to concentration. As a matrix control, we use an engineered enveloped RNA virus. Surprisingly, after concentration, the recovery of SARS-CoV-2 signal is consistently higher than the recovery of the control virus leading us to question the nature of the SARS-CoV-2 genetic material detected in wastewater. We see no significant difference in signal after different 24-hour temperature changes; however, treatment with detergent decreases signal [~]100-fold. Furthermore, the density of the samples is comparable to enveloped retrovirus particles, yet, interestingly, when raw wastewater samples were used to inoculate cells, no cytopathic effects were seen indicating that wastewater samples do not contain infectious SARS-CoV-2. Together, this suggests that wastewater contains fully intact enveloped particles.","Robinson, Carolyn A; Hsieh, Hsin-yeh; Hsu, Shu Yu; Wang, Yang; Salcedo, Braxton; Klutts, Jessica; Zemmer, Sally; Belenchia, Anthony; Reynolds, Melissa; Semkiw, Elizabeth; Foley, Trevor; Wan, Xiu-feng; Wieberg, Chris; Wenzel, Jeff; Lin, Chung-Ho; Johnson, Marc C",,,273

They argue about the need for making translations available in other languages and centralized access to regional databases and that one should not disregard citations in other languages. This fact could not be any more real in the current situation regarding the novel coronavirus. When considering treatment, diagnosis and prevention, around 44% of the articles in PubMed were written in Chinese. This prompts the urgent need for quality automatic translation to make such extremely valuable information available to medical personnel in as many languages as possible. We also point out that the community should also make efforts to guarantee editorial quality and to follow the best practices in editing and publishing. This is of critical importance as well, such that the content is properly scrutinized before being published.","Soares, Felipe; Yamashita, Gabrielli Harumi",Int J Infect Dis,,273
404629,Response to Felgendreff et al,2021,"Motivated with various responses of world governments to COVID-19, here we develop a toy model of the dependence epidemics spreading on the availability of tests for disease. Our model, that we call SUDR+K, is based on usual SIR model, but it splits the total fraction of infected individuals into two components: those that are undetected and those that are detected through tests. Moreover, we assume that available tests increase at a constant rate from the beginning of epidemics but are consumed to detect infected individuals. Strikingly we find a bi-stable behavior between a phase with a giant fraction of infected and a phase with a very small fraction. We show that the separation between these two regimes is governed by a match between the rate of testing and a rate of infection spread at given time. We also show that the existence of two phases does not depend on the mathematical choice of the form of the term describing the rate at which undetected individuals are tested and detected. Presented research implies that a vigorous early testing activity, before the epidemics enters into its giant phase, can potentially keep epidemics under control, and that even a very small change in rate of testing can increase or decrease the size of the whole epidemics of various orders of magnitude. For the real application of realistic model to ongoing epidemics, we would gladly collaborate with field epidemiologists in order to develop quantitative models of testing process.","Zlati'c, Vinko; Barjavsi'c, Irena; Kadovi'c, Andrea; vStefanvci'c, Hrvoje; Gabrielli, Andrea",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.08479v1.pdf,273

It also deprived them of in-person counselling services and social support. These changes have put students at a greater risk of developing mental illness. The objective of this review is to assess the prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms and sleep disturbances in higher education students during the pandemic. A systematic search of English and Chinese databases was conducted current to January 1st, 2021. The quality of included studies was evaluated using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms and sleep disturbances were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Eighty-nine studies (n=1,441,828) were included. The pooled prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and sleep disturbances was 34%, 32% and 33%, respectively. The prevalence values differ based on geographical regions, diagnostic criteria, education level, undergraduate year of study, financial situation, living arrangements and gender. Overall, the prevalence of depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms synthesized in this study was higher compared to pre-pandemic prevalence in similar populations. Evidently, mental health screening and intervention should be a top priority for universities and colleges during the pandemic.","Deng, Jiawen; Zhou, Fangwen; Hou, Wenteng; Silver, Zachary; Wong, Chi Yi; Chang, Oswin; Drakos, Anastasia; Zuo, Qi Kang; Huang, Emma",Psychiatry Res,,273

415162,Epidemiological correlation between COVID-19 epidemic and prevalence of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency in the world,2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory illness that can spread from person to person. The virus that causes COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus that was first identified during an investigation into an outbreak in Wuhan, China. The clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to be wide, encompassing asymptomatic infection, mild upper respiratory tract illness, and severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure and even death, with many patients being hospitalised with pneumonia. In China and East Asia, Chinese medicine has been widely used to treat diverse diseases for thousands of years. As an important means of treatment now, Chinese medicine plays a significant role in the treatment of respiratory diseases in China. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of Chinese medicine for COVID-19. METHODS: We will search the following sources for the identification of trials: The Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure Database (CNKI), Chinese Science and Technique Journals Database (VIP), and the Wanfang Database. All the above databases will be searched from the available date of inception until the latest issue. No language or publication restriction will be used. Randomized controlled trials will be included if they recruited participants with COVID-19 for assessing the effect of Chinese medicine vs control (placebo, no treatment, and other therapeutic agents). Primary outcomes will include chest CT and nucleic acid detection of respiratory samples. Two authors will independently scan the articles searched, extract the data from articles included, and assess the risk of bias by Cochrane tool of risk of bias. Disagreements will be resolved by consensus or the involvement of a third party. All analysis will be performed based on the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Dichotomous variables will be reported as risk ratio or odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and continuous variables will be summarized as mean difference or standard mean difference with 95% CIs. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The available evidence of the treatment of COVID-19 with traditional Chinese medicine will be summarized, and evaluation of the efficacy and the adverse effects of these treatments will be made. This review will be disseminated in print by peer-review.","Chen, Huizhen; Xie, Ziyan; Zhu, Yuxia; Chen, Qiu; Xie, Chunguang",Medicine (Baltimore),,273

METHODS: This was a multicentre, retrospective, observational cohort study which involved all vascular surgery services in Lombardy, Northern Italy. Data were retrospectively merged into a combined dataset covering the nine weeks of the Italian COVID-19 pandemic phase 1 (8 March 2020 to 3 May 2020). The primary outcome was freedom from in hospital death, secondary outcomes were re-thrombosis rate after peripheral revascularisation, and freedom from post-operative complication. RESULTS: Among 674 patients managed during the outbreak, 659 (97.8%) were included in the final analysis: 121 (18.4%) were CV19-pos. CV19-pos status was associated with a higher rate of complications (OR 4.5; p < .001, 95% CI 2.64 - 7.84), and a higher rate of re-thrombosis after peripheral arterial revascularisation (OR 2.2; p = .004, 95% CI 1.29 - 3.88). In hospital mortality was higher in CV19-pos patients (24.8% vs. 5.6%; OR 5.4, p < .001;95% CI 2.86 - 8.92). Binary logistic regression analysis identified CV19-pos status (OR 7.6; p < .001, 95% CI 3.75 - 15.28) and age > 80 years (OR 3.2; p = .001, 95% CI 1.61 - 6.57) to be predictors of in hospital death. CONCLUSION: In this experience of the vascular surgery group of Lombardy, COVID-19 infection was a marker of poor outcomes in terms of mortality and post-operative complications for patients undergoing vascular surgery treatments.","Bellosta, Raffaello; Piffaretti, Gabriele; Bonardelli, Stefano; Castelli, Patrizio; Chiesa, Roberto; Frigerio, Dalmazio; Lanza, Gaetano; Pirrelli, Stefano; Rossi, Giovanni; Trimarchi, Santi",Eur J Vasc Endovasc Surg,,273

416854,Measuring the impact of spatial perturbations on the relationship between data privacy and validity of descriptive statistics,2021,"COVID-19 has caused a global rush of universities to transfer their courses online to maintain continuity in student teaching and learning. The study presented in this article investigated the preparedness of academics in Small Island Developing State (SIDS) universities for shifting to emergency online teaching. To examine the impact of preparedness and other factors on the efficacy of academic staff in performing their work duties during the pandemic, the research team collected data from 75 respondents who filled in a questionnaire. In addition, they conducted semi-structured online interviews with a subsample of 5 respondents. They found that most academics had the necessary tools and infrastructure to teach online, including access to reasonably fast internet connections. However, many of them lacked adequate training in applying the use of technology to teaching, which limited their preparedness for developing e-learning activities. Thus, the study found that, insufficient competence in using educational technologies and inadequate university support impacted academics' work efficacy significantly. This impact was less pronounced for staff who had prior online teaching experience, which suggests that their pre-pandemic experiences lessened their dependence on support for online teaching when the sudden need arose. The authors' thematic analysis similarly found academics' uneven familiarity with technology and the need for more ""at-the-elbow"" technological support during crises to be significant, as well as a need for more leadership to deal with complex situations. Based on their findings, the authors conclude that greater preparedness for online teaching - and thus improved efficacy - might be achieved through a balanced mix of independent learning (by doing) on the part of academic staff and customised and targeted formal professional learning (through training provided by the university).","Seetal, Isma; Gunness, Sandhya; Teeroovengadum, Viraiyan",Int Rev Educ,,273

In this review, we identify a treatment strategy for anaphylaxis that balances the risks versus benefits of ED versus home management in this unprecedented time. Recent Findings: Physicians and patients have had to adapt new approaches to medical care during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic due to restricted access to health care facilities. Telemedicine has substituted in-person visits, and such a drastic change in the patient care paradigm presents a need to revise the acute management of anaphylaxis. Summary: Physicians should utilize telemedicine during this time to engage in shared decision-making with patients and their families to devise an anaphylaxis plan of management that emphasizes home care when symptoms are mild with an exception for ED care if a patient has had severe, near-fatal anaphylaxis episodes in the past. Previous anaphylaxis recommendations should remain in place despite the pandemic, including prompt use of epinephrine when needed, avoidance of known allergens, training of patients and their caregivers, and carrying of epinephrine autoinjector devices at all times to remain prepared in the event of an anaphylaxis episode.

However, it is challenging to properly evaluate device performance and train medical personnel for device deployment without the aid of functionally relevant models. Current in vitro aneurysm models suffer from a lack of key functional and morphological features of brain vasculature that limit their applicability for these purposes. These features include the physiologically relevant mechanical properties and the dynamic cellular environment of blood vessels subjected to constant fluid flow. Herein, we developed three dimensionally (3D) printed aneurysm-bearing vascularized tissue structures using gelatin-fibrin hydrogel of which the inner vessel walls were seeded with human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (hCMECs). The hCMECs readily exhibited cellular attachment, spreading, and confluency all around the vessel walls, including the aneurysm walls. Additionally, the in vitro devices were directly amenable to flow measurements via particle image velocimetry, enabling the direct assessment of the vascular flow dynamics for comparison to a 3D computational hydrodynamics model. Detachable coils were delivered into the printed aneurysm sac through the vessel using a microcatheter and static blood plasma clotting was monitored inside the aneurysm sac and around the coils. This biomimetic aneurysm in vitro model is a promising method for examining the biocompatibility and hemostatic efficiency of embolization devices and for providing hemodynamic information which would aid in predicting aneurysm rupture or healing response after treatment.","Jang, Lindy; Alvarado, Javier; Pepona, Marianna; Wasson, Elisa; Nash, Landon; Ortega, Jason; Randles, Amanda; Maitland, Duncan; Moya, Monica; Hynes, William Frederick",Biofabrication (Online),,273

(2) Methods: Visual examinations of daily increases in confirmed COVID-19 cases in 124 countries, determined first and second waves in 28 countries. (3) Results: The first wave spread rate increases with country mean elevation, median population age, time since wave onset, and decreases with temperature. Spread rates decrease above 1000 m, indicating high ultraviolet lights (UVs) decrease the spread rate. The second wave associations are the opposite, i.e., spread increases with temperature and young age, and decreases with time since wave onset. The earliest second waves started 5-7 April at mutagenic high elevations (Armenia, Algeria). The second waves also occurred at the warm-to-cold season transition (Argentina, Chile). Second vs. first wave spread decreases in most (77%) countries. In countries with late first wave onset, spread rates better fit second than first wave-temperature patterns. In countries with ageing populations (for example, Japan, Sweden, and Ukraine), second waves only adapted to spread at higher temperatures, not to infect the young. (4) Conclusions: First wave viruses evolved towards lower spread. Second wave mutant COVID-19 strain(s) adapted to higher temperature, infecting younger ages and replacing (also in cold conditions) first wave COVID-19 strains. Counterintuitively, low spread strains replace high spread strains, rendering prognostics and extrapolations uncertain.","Seligmann, Hervé; Iggui, Siham; Rachdi, Mustapha; Vuillerme, Nicolas; Demongeot, Jacques",,,273

Both S and M were chosen for the development of a chimeric vaccine that can generate memory B and T cells. siRNAs were also designed for S and M gene silencing. Moreover, six new drug candidates were suggested that might inhibit the activity of RdRp. Since SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 have 82.30% sequence identity, a Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) patients were analyzed. In this analysis, 13 immunoregulatory genes were found that can be used to develop type 1 interferon (IFN) based therapy. The proposed vaccine, siRNAs, drugs and IFN based analysis of this study will accelerate the development of new treatments.","Hossain, Mohammad Uzzal; Bhattacharjee, Arittra; Emon, Md Tabassum Hossain; Chowdhury, Zeshan Mahmud; Mosaib, Md Golam; Mourin, Muntahi; Das, Keshob Chandra; Keya, Chaman Ara; Salimullah, Md",Gene,,273

This study aims to provide a detailed systematic review of diarrhoea in adults with COVID-19. METHODS: A PUBMED and Scopus search (until 7 September 2020) was performed. Studies that were limited to describing incidence of diarrhoea and its effect on prognosis were excluded. RESULTS: Twenty-six papers including 7860 patients with COVID-19 were subjected to synthesis. Mean duration of diarrhoea was 4.2 (3.6-4.9) days (range 1-16 days), whereas mean bowel movement count was 4.6 (3.8-5.3) and maximum was 20 per day. Diarrhoea started on an average 5.1 (3.8-6.5) days after disease onset but was the first manifestation in 4.3% patients. Stool occult blood was detected in 6.8% of patients with diarrhoea, while 53.3% cases had watery diarrhoea. Patients with diarrhoea also had elevated faecal calprotectin. Viral genome in faeces was detected more often in patients with diarrhoea and most often in patients without respiratory symptoms. Fever, myalgia and respiratory symptoms were observed with the same incidence in patients with and without diarrhoea. Similarly, there were no differences noted in complete blood count and most inflammation biomarkers between patients with and without diarrhoea. However, nausea, vomiting abdominal pain, sneezing and headache were more common in patients with diarrhoea. Diarrhoea was the main manifestation of COVID-19 in 6.1% of cases and this form of the disease had specific features. CONCLUSIONS: Diarrhoea in COVID-19 needs further investigation.","Maslennikov, Roman; Poluektova, Elena; Ivashkin, Vladimir; Svistunov, Andrey",Infect Dis (Lond),,273

Aberrant profiles of DNA methylation have already been associated with cardiovascular diseases. We evaluated 190 patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) and 75 patients without ACS (non-ACS). Patient severity was assessed by the TIMI risk score, and both levels of global DNA methylation (ACS = 190; non-ACS = 75), stratified in expected group (male &#8805; 65 years; female &#8805; 55 years) and early group (male <65 years; female <55 years). As results, the ACS and non-ACS groups showed different levels of global DNA methylation, and patients with ACS were more methylated (p = 0.0121). Patients with ACS, showed a difference (p < 0.0001) in methylation profiles between groups. The low TIMI group had a higher level of DNA methylation, while the intermediate / high group showed a decreased methylation pattern. A negative correlation was observed between the level of global methylation and the increase in age (p = 0.0387; r = -0.15), which became hypomethylated over the years. The hypermethylated global DNA profile by its association with the development of ACS can be a potential biomarker.","Carla Silva Soares, Fábia; Amorim, Ester A S; Martins Araújo, Romário; Pereira Werkhauser, Roberto; Tadeu Nunes Diniz, George; Carvalho, Viviane Dcv; Silva, Lilían Ca; Montenegro, Sergio T; Moraes, Clarice N L; Martins, Danyelly B G; Montenegro, Sílvia M L",Clin. chim. acta,,273

El contagio del SARS-CoV-2 es rápido y su transmisión se da a través de gotas de saliva. De allí su importancia en la odontología. Objetivo Identificar los principales riesgos, vías de transmisión y medidas de prevención frente al COVID-19. Métodos Se realizó una revisión de literatura científica de los últimos dos años sobre el tema, en las bases de datos PubMed, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar y Research Gate. Los descriptores utilizados fueron los siguientes: ""coronavirus"", ""COVID-19"", ""dental"", ""dentistry"", ""oral"", ""stomatology"" y ""aerosol"". Se encontraron 350 artículos, de lo que se seleccionaron 50 por su actualidad, relación y enfoque. La transmisión del COVID-19 se da principalmente a través de gotas de saliva, aerosoles y fómites. El virus puede subsistir por un tiempo en el ambiente y en las superficies. Los odontólogos son trabajadores de la salud con peligro de contagiarse debido que varios de sus procedimientos liberan aerosoles. La bioseguridad en el ejercicio de esta profesión debe ser estricta y extrema, también la limpieza y desinfección del ambiente y superficies de contacto. Conclusiones En la profesión odontológica el riesgo potencial de contaminación entre operados, asistentes y pacientes es alto. El conocimiento del agente causal y de la enfermedad permitirá reducir la posibilidad de contagio. El odontólogo debe considerar a los pacientes como sospechosos de COVID-19 y aplicar la bioseguridad a todo nivel.","Herrera-Plasencia, Paul M.; Enoki-Miñano, Erika; Ruiz-Barrueto, Miguel y A.",Rev. salud pública,,273
427597,Digital technologies in the public-health response to COVID-19,2020,"7-Ketocholesterol, which is one of the earliest cholesterol oxidization products identified, is essentially formed by the auto-oxidation of cholesterol. In the body, 7-ketocholesterol is both provided by food and produced endogenously. This pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory molecule, which can activate apoptosis and autophagy at high concentrations, is an abundant component of oxidized Low Density Lipoproteins. 7-Ketocholesterol appears to significantly contribute to the development of age-related diseases (cardiovascular diseases, age-related macular degeneration, and Alzheimer's disease), chronic inflammatory bowel diseases and to certain cancers. Recent studies have also shown that 7-ketocholesterol has anti-viral activities, including on SARS-CoV-2, which are, however, lower than those of oxysterols resulting from the oxidation of cholesterol on the side chain. Furthermore, 7-ketocholesterol is increased in the serum of moderately and severely affected COVID-19 patients. In the case of COVID-19, it can be assumed that the antiviral activity of 7-ketocholesterol could be counterbalanced by its toxic effects, including pro-oxidant, pro-inflammatory and pro-coagulant activities that might promote the induction of cell death in alveolar cells. It is therefore suggested that this oxysterol might be involved in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 by contributing to the acute respiratory distress syndrome and promoting a deleterious, even fatal outcome. Thus, 7-ketocholesterol could possibly constitute a lipid biomarker of COVID-19 outcome and counteracting its toxic effects with adjuvant therapies might have beneficial effects in COVID-19 patients.","Ghzaiel, Imen; Sassi, Khouloud; Zarrouk, Amira; Nury, Thomas; Ksila, Mohamed; Leoni, Valerio; Bouhaouala-Zahar, Balkiss; Hammami, Sonia; Hammami, Mohamed; Mackrill, John J; Samadi, Mohammad; Ghrairi, Taoufik; Vejux, Anne; Lizard, Gérard",J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol,,273

We aimed to clarify the impact of social restrictions imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic on neuropsychiatric symptoms in PD patients and to identify risk factors associated with these symptoms. A cross-sectional, hospital-based survey was conducted from April 22, 2020 to May 15, 2020. PD patients and their family members were asked to complete paper-based questionnaires about neuropsychiatric symptoms by mail. PD patients were evaluated for motor symptoms using MDS-UPDRS part 2 by telephone interview. A total of 71 responders (39 PD patients and 32 controls) completed the study. Although there was no difference in the age distribution, the rate of females was significantly lower in PD patients (35%) than controls (84%) (P < 0.001). Participants with clinical depression (PHQ-9 score &#8805; 10) were more common in PD patients (39%) than controls (6%) (P = 0.002). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that an MDS-UPDRS part 2 score was correlated with the presence of clinical depression (PHQ-9 score &#8805; 10) and clinical anxiety (GAD-7 score &#8805; 7) (clinical depression: OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.04-1.66; P = 0.025; clinical anxiety: OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.07-1.72; P = 0.013).

431872,"Factors associated with social responsibility among university students in Yala, Thailand during the COVID-19 pandemic",2021,"BACKGROUND: The use of a mesh in primary ventral or incisional hernia repair lowers the recurrence rate and is the accepted standard of care for larger defects. In laparoscopic primary ventral or incisional hernia repair the insertion of a mesh is indispensable. Different mesh fixation techniques have been used and refined over the years. The type of fixation technique is claimed to have a major impact on recurrence rates, chronic pain, health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and complication rates. OBJECTIVES: To determine the impact of different mesh fixation techniques for primary and incisional ventral hernia repair on hernia recurrence, chronic pain, HRQOL and complications. SEARCH METHODS: On 2 October 2020 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE (Ovid MEDLINE(R)) Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE(R) Daily and Ovid MEDLINE(R)), Ovid Embase, and two trials registries. We also performed handsearches, and contacted experts from the European Hernia Society (EHS). SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including adults with primary ventral or incisional hernia that compared different types of mesh fixation techniques (absorbable/nonabsorbable sutures, absorbable/nonabsorbable tacks, fibrin glue, and combinations of these techniques). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We extracted data in standardised piloted tables, or if necessary, directly into Review Manager 5. We assessed risks of bias with the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. Two review authors independently selected the publications, and extracted data on results. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) for binary outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes. For pooling we used an inverse-variance random-effects meta-analysis or the Peto method in the case of rare events. We prepared GRADE 'Summary of findings' tables. For laparoscopic repair we considered absorbable tacks compared to nonabsorbable tacks, and nonabsorbable tacks compared to nonabsorbable sutures as key comparisons. MAIN RESULTS: We included 10 trials with a total of 787 participants. The number of randomised participants ranged from 40 to 199 per comparison. Eight studies included participants with both primary and incisional ventral hernia. One study included only participants with umbilical hernia, and another only participants with incisional hernia. Hernia size varied between studies. We judged the risk of bias as moderate to high. Absorbable tacks compared to nonabsorbable tacks Recurrence rates in the groups were similar (RR 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17 to 3.22; 2 studies, 101 participants). It is uncertain whether there is a difference between absorbable tacks and nonabsorbable tacks in recurrence because the certainty of evidence was very low. Evidence suggests that the difference between groups in early postoperative, late follow-up, chronic pain and HRQOL is negligible. Nonabsorbable tacks compared to nonabsorbable sutures At six months there was one recurrence in each group (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.07 to 14.79; 1 study, 36 participants). It is uncertain whether there is a difference between nonabsorbable tacks and nonabsorbable sutures in recurrence because the certainty of evidence was very low. Evidence suggests that the difference between groups in early postoperative, late follow-up and chronic pain is negligible. We found no study that assessed HRQOL. Absorbable tacks compared to absorbable sutures No recurrence was observed at one year (very low certainty of evidence). Early postoperative pain was higher in the tacks group (VAS 0 - 10: MD -2.70, 95% CI -6.67 to 1.27; 1 study, 48 participants). It is uncertain whether there is a difference between absorbable tacks compared to absorbable sutures in early postoperative pain because the certainty of evidence was very low. The MD for late follow-up pain was -0.30 (95% CI -0.74 to 0.14; 1 study, 48 participants). We found no study that assessed HRQOL. Combination of different fixation types (tacks and sutures) or materials (absorbable and nonabsorbable) There were mostly negligible or only small differences between combinations (e.g. tacks plus sutures) compared to a single technique (e.g. sutures only), as well as combinations compared to other combinations (e.g. absorbable sutures combined with nonabsorbable sutures compared to absorbable tacks combined with nonabsorbable tacks) in all outcomes. It is uncertain whether there is an advantage for combining different fixation types or materials for recurrence, chronic pain, HRQOL and complications, because the evidence certainty was very low or low, or we found no study on important outcomes. Nonabsorbable tacks compared to fibrin sealant The two studies showed different directions of effects: one showed higher rates for nonabsorbable tacks, and the other showed higher rates for fibrin sealant. Low-certainty evidence suggests that the difference between groups in early postoperative, late follow-up, chronic pain and HRQOL is negligible. Absorbable tacks compared to fibrin sealant One recurrence in the tacks group and none in the fibrin sealant group were noted after one year (low certainty of evidence). Early postoperative pain might be slightly lower using tacks (VAS 0 - 100; MD -12.40, 95% CI -27.60 to, 2.80;1 study, 50 participants; low-certainty evidence). The pattern of pain and HRQOL course over time (up to 1 year) was similar in the groups (low certainty of evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Currently none of the techniques can be considered superior to any other, because the certainty of evidence was low or very low for all outcomes.","Mathes, Tim; Prediger, Barbara; Walgenbach, Maren; Siegel, Robert",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,,273

Despite an unprecedented focus of scientific investigation, there is a paucity of evidence-based pharmacotherapies against this disease. Because of this lack of data-driven treatment strategies, broad variations in practice patterns have emerged. Observed hypercoagulability in patients with COVID-19 has created debate within the critical care community on the therapeutic utility of heparin. We seek to provide an overview of the data supporting the therapeutic use of heparin, both unfractionated and low molecular weight, as an anticoagulant for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, we review preclinical evidence establishing biological plausibility for heparin and synthetic heparin-like drugs as therapies for COVID-19 through antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects. Finally, we discuss known adverse effects and theoretical off-target effects that may temper enthusiasm for the adoption of heparin as a therapy in COVID-19 without confirmatory prospective randomized controlled trials. Despite previous failures of anticoagulants in critical illness, plausibility of heparin for COVID-19 is sufficiently robust to justify urgent randomized controlled trials to determine the safety and effectiveness of this therapy.","Hippensteel, Joseph A; LaRiviere, Wells B; Colbert, James F; Langouët-Astrié, Christophe J; Schmidt, Eric P",Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol,,273

Meanwhile, few studies focused on the midterm sequelae, which still remain largely unknown. AIM: To assess the physical performance of COVID-19 survivors at 3 to 6 months from Hospital discharge. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study focused on mid-term functional outcomes evaluation in COVID-19 survivors. SETTING: Outpatients who had been previously hospitalized due to COVID-19 from March to May 2020 at the University Hospital of Novara, Italy. POPULATION: We enrolled 204 patients, of which 60% were men, with the mean age of 57.9 years. METHODS: Patients firstly underwent the short physical performance battery test (SPPB), which is composed of a series of physical tests assessing the lower limb function and the functional status of the subjects. Subsequently, based on SPPB results, patients' cardiorespiratory fitness performance was further investigated. Patients with normal SPPB score (SPPB>10) underwent the 2-minute walking test (2MWT) whereas, in order to safely test the cardiorespiratory function, in patients with abnormal SPPB score (SPPB&#8804;10) the 1-minute sit-to-stand test (1MSTST) was performed. It should be noted that the 1MSTST can be safely performed even by subjects with compromised walking ability. RESULTS: Overall, 66 patients (32% of our sample) showed an impaired physical performance at 3 to 6 months after hospital discharge. In particular, 29 patients presented an SPPB score &#8804;10, and the 1MSTST confirmed this status in the whole group (100%) compared to the reference values for age and sex. Besides, among patients with a normal SPPB score, 37 showed a lower sex- and age-matched 2MWT score. Finally, a significant association between Intensive Care Unit hospitalization or mechanical ventilation and physical impairment was observed together with a significant association between the walking ability (measured with SPPB and 2MWT) and the number of comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: A residual physical and functional impairment was observed in COVID-19 survivors at mid-term evaluation after hospitalization.

METHOD: A cross-sectional survey was conducted between October 1 and December 1, 2020, in Iran. The study population consisted of patients who used the service. Three hundred-ninety-six patients were enrolled in the study by convenience sampling. Data were collected by a researcher-made questionnaire. The face, comprehensibility, and content validity of the questionnaire were tested and met. The reliability of this questionnaire was confirmed (r = 0.9). Descriptive statistics and multinomial logistic regression were conducted. Data were analyzed using STATA 14.0 software. RESULTS: In total, 396 patients responded to the online questionnaire. The mean age of patients was 37 ± 10.31 years. More than half of them had an academic degree (65.40 %). Teleconsultation was considered satisfactory by 172 patients (43.43 %), while more than half of the patients (56.57 %) were unsatisfied with teleconsultation. In terms of ""quality of care provided"" and ""patient information privacy"" components, around 41 % of patients were satisfied. However, the number of patients who feel satisfied with teleconsultation's similarity to a face-to-face encounter was lower (37.88 %). The results showed no significant relationship between age, gender, education, and overall satisfaction (p > 0.05). The association between overall satisfaction and health status was (AOR = 1.51, 95 % CI = 1.16-1.96). CONCLUSION: More than half of patients from our study did not have a good experience with teleconsultation. This is also partially due to the use of existing communication platform, instead of custom-made solution. It is necessary to improve the services' quality and meet patients' needs to optimize patients' experience, particularly during a health crisis, resulting in better health outcomes and end-user satisfaction.","Jannati, Nazanin; Nakhaee, Nouzar; Yazdi-Feyzabadi, Vahid; Tjondronegoro, Dian",Int J Med Inform,,273

434797,Examination of Digital Parenting Awareness of the Primary School Students' Parents During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers (HCWs) accounted for a significant proportion of COVID-19 infections worldwide. Retrospective seroprevalence surveys are often used to screen for unidentified previous infection with SARS-CoV-2. However, the rate of humoral response in HCWs affected by COVID-19 is not well-defined. AIMS: To assess the specific IgG humoral response in symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected HCWs and identify potential factors associated with humoral response. METHODS: We prospectively recruited 204 HCWs with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 humoral response. Serum-IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were analysed using two commercially available serological assays. A logistic regression was performed to identify independent factors associated with positive IgG serology test. RESULTS: Overall, the SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity rate was 77%. This seropositivity rate was higher in symptomatic than in asymptomatic COVID-19 infection (83% versus 57%; P < 0.001) and in older HCWs.. The seropositivity rate did not diminish with time. In logistic regression, only a history of COVID-19 symptoms and age were identified as independent factors associated with the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies are found significantly more frequently in symptomatic and in older HCWs. The fact that not all COVID-19 HCWs develop detectable IgG is vital for the interpretation of COVID-19 seroprevalence surveys.","Cordova, E; Bacelar, B; Nieto, F; Garibaldi, F; Aguirre, V; Machuca, M; Badia, M; Rodriguez, C",Occup. med,,273

The subsequent phase-wise relaxation from July 2020 led to a surge in the number of cases. This necessitated an understanding of the true burden of SARS-CoV-2 in the community. Consequently, a sero-epidemiological survey was carried out in the central Indian city of Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh. This article details the processes of data acquisition, compilation, handling, and information derivation from the survey. Information on socio-demographic and serological variables were collected from 4,883 participants using a multi-stage stratified random sampling method. Appropriate weightage was calculated for each participant as sampling fraction derived from Primary Sampling Unit (PSU), Secondary Sampling Unit (SSU) and Tertiary Sampling Unit (TSU). The weightage was then applied to the data to adjust the findings at population level. The comprehensive and robust methodology employed here may act as a model for similar future endeavours. At the same time, the dataset can also be relevant for researchers in fields such as data science, epidemiology, virology and earth modelling. © 2021","Joshi, A.; Shankar, P.; Chatterjee, A.; Singh, J.; Pakhare, A.; Yadav, K.; Shrivas, A.; Maurya, A.

In this research, we collected data from January 1 to March 30, 2020 (90 days). This study used secondary data of meteorological and air pollutant parameters obtained from the Pollution Control Department of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment as well as daily confirmed COVID-19 case data in the BMR obtained from the official webpage of the Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Thailand. We employed descriptive statistics, and Spearman and Kendall rank correlation tests were used to investigate the associations of weather variables, air pollutants, AQI with daily confirmed COVID-19 cases. Our findings indicate that CO, NO2, SO2, O3 PM10, PM2.5, AQI have a significantly negative association with daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in the BMR, whereas meteorological parameters such as temperature, relative humidity (RH), absolute humidity (AH) and wind speed (WS) showed significant positive associations with daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in the BMR. Our study is a useful supplement to encourage regulatory bodies to promote environmental strategies, as air pollution regulation could be a sustainable policy for mitigating the harmful effects of air pollutants. Furthermore, this study provides new insights into the relationship between daily meteorological factors, AQI, and air pollutants and daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in the BMR. These data may provide useful information to the public health authorities and decision makers in Thailand, as well as to the World Health Organization (WHO), in order to set proper strategic aimed at reducing the impact of the COVID-19. Future studies concerning SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses should investigate the possibility of infectious droplet dispersion in indoor and outdoor air during and after the epidemic outbreak.","Sangkham, Sarawut; Thongtip, Sakesun; Vongruang, Patipat",Environ Res,,273

We examined transcriptional profiles of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples to identify molecular mechanisms underlying these coagulopathies. mRNA levels for regulators of the kallikrein-kinin (C1-inhibitor), coagulation (thrombomodulin, endothelial protein C receptor), and fibrinolytic (urokinase and urokinase receptor) pathways were significantly reduced in COVID-19 patients. While transcripts for several coagulation proteins were increased, those encoding tissue factor, the protein that initiates coagulation and whose expression is frequently increased in inflammatory disorders, were not increased in BALF from COVID-19 patients. Our analysis implicates enhanced propagation of coagulation and decreased fibrinolysis as drivers of the coagulopathy in the lungs of COVID-19 patients.","Mast, Alan E; Wolberg, Alisa S; Gailani, David; Garvin, Michael R; Alvarez, Christiane; Miller, J Izaak; Aronow, Bruce; Jacobson, Daniel",eLife (Cambridge),,273

Intercontinental trends in neurosurgeons' perception and practices of telemedicine have been sparingly reported. METHODS: We conducted an online anonymized and validated survey using a structured questionnaire to gain insight into neurosurgeons' experience with telemedicine across various continents and rated its usefulness on a 5-point Likert scale. RESULTS: We received 286 responses across 5 continents. There was a trend to support a major paradigm shift favoring teleconsultations during the COVID-19 pandemic in respondents from North America (P = 0.06). Signed prescriptions were e-mailed along with video-based teleconsultations preferentially in Europe and North America. In comparison, audio- or text-based teleconsultations along with unsigned prescriptions were prevalent in Asia and Africa (P = 0.0005). Acceptability and perceived usefulness for telemedicine during the pandemic were similar across the globe, regardless of neurosurgeons' experience (mean satisfaction score 3.72 ± 1.09; P = 0.62). A majority of neurosurgeons from Asia and South America complained of difficulties during teleconsultations owing to lack of appropriate infrastructure, internet connectivity/prescription-related issues, and potential risk of litigation (P = 0.0005). Approximately 46% of neurosurgeons, predominantly from Europe and North America, thought that telemedicine could play a vital role in clinical practice even after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides (mean satisfaction score 3.26 ± 1.16; P = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine in neurosurgery is a viable alternative to physical outpatient services during the COVID-19 pandemic and could potentially play a vital role after the pandemic.","Tandon, Vivek; Raheja, Amol; Mishra, Shashwat; Garg, Kanwaljeet; Dash, Chinmaya; Borkar, Sachin A; Wellington, Jack; Chaurasia, Bipin; Fontanella, Marco M; Suri, Ashish; Chandra, P Sarat; Kale, Shashank S",World neurosurgery (Online),,273

We supposed that MDSCs also contributed to the impaired antitumor immunity in MDS. Here we demonstrated that STAT3-ARG1 pathway could be a critical signal transduction pathway that regulated MDSCs-mediated immunosuppression. Increased MDSCs was revealed in MDS patients when compared to healthy controls. Especially, MDSCs performed higher activated STAT3 and CCR2 expression in high-risk MDS patients. The CCL2 and IL-6 levels in MDS patients were also higher than in healthy controls, which could drive recruitment and activation of MDSCs. Meanwhile, lower expression levels of CD3Î¶ chain, perforin and granzyme B were demonstrated in MDS patients, which were associated with downregulated activation of CD8+ T lymphocytes. The results were supported by the decreased perforin, granzyme B and IFN-Î³ levels in the mixed-culture system of MDSCs and CD8+ T lymphocytes in vitro. Notably, targeting STAT3 pathway by selective inhibitor could decrease ARG1 expression in MDSCs and partially reverse the lower expression levels of effector molecules on CD8+ T lymphocytes. Therefore, this study revealed the potential STAT3-ARG1 mechanism behind MDSCs and provided a promising STAT3 targeting strategy in MDS.","Qi, Xiao; Jiang, Huijuan; Liu, Pei; Xie, Ning; Fu, Rong; Wang, Huaquan; Liu, Chunyan; Zhang, Tian; Wang, Huaqing; Shao, Zonghong",Leuk Lymphoma,,273

It is not restricted to any part of the society neither to any specific country or human activity or age;it is used by everyone, everywhere, in both real world and virtual platform. A quick search using the keywords Covid-19 and intellectual property rights (IPR), will mainly yield articles about the impact of Covid- 19- as a pandemic-on the protection of IPR and the measures to be taken by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) or other entities-providing legal services related to intellectual property-to preserve the pre-owned IPR and the means of assuring the sustainability of this protection during this pandemic. Nevertheless, in addition to the necessity ofpreserving the protection of IPR during this pandemic, a need to analyze and study the legal status of Covid-19 is today eminent: the most used designation as an element of the IPR constituting a new distinctive sign (DS). In turn, this study will analyze Covid-19 not as a pandemic but as a DS. This study will be the first of its kind in the field of IPR paving the way towards the recognition of the legal status of Covid-19 as a new DS: this is vital knowing that the use of this term must be regulated to avoid confusing or misleading the consumer;such use has to be in conformity with the laws of the distinctive signs prohibiting illegal use as per article 3 of the GCC Trademark Law (GCC TM). This study will reflect how the protection of Covid-19 is recognized as a new DS and its relation with the GCC TM focusing on the International means of protection through Paris Convention and the European Law and mainly the French Law due to the similarities in the stipulations of the French Law especially with regard to article 3 of the GCC TM: in fact, article L 713-2 of the French Code of Intellectual Property enumerates, similarly to the GCC TM, the signs that cannot be registered as trademarks mainly those who are deceptive. The possibility of the protection of the Covid-19 designation as a DS will protect the consumer against any misleading or deceptive use of the aforementioned designation specially that the GCC Trademark Law has explicit stipulations in this regard as previously mentioned.","Khater, Christiane Bou","Journal of Legal, Ethical and Regulatory Issues",,273

DESIGN & SETTINGS: The category, period, and regions selected in the Google Trends were ""health,"" ""15 January-15 May 2020,"" in the USA, the United Kingdom (UK), Germany, Italy, and France, respectively. The most commonly searched dietary supplements and functional foods (n = 32) during the pandemic were determined from a pool of keywords (n = 1,286) based on the terms' relative search volumes (RSVs) within the last five years. Correlation analyses were conducted to invesitgate associations between coronavirus-related parameters with each keyword's RSV for each country. Selected keywords (n = 25) were analyzed using the gtrendsR package in the R programming language; the ggplot2 package was used to visualize the data, the Prophet package was used to estimate the time series, and the dplyr package was used to create the data frame. RESULTS: Significantly strong positive correlations were identified between daily RSVs of the terms ""black seed,""""vitamin C,""""zinc,"" and ""quercetin,"" and search queries for ""coronavirus"" and ""COVID-19"" in the USA (Spearman's correlation coefficient >0.8, p < 0.000), and between the RSVs of the terms ""vitamin C"" and ""zinc,"" and daily search queries for ""coronavirus"" and/or ""COVID-19"" in the UK (Spearman's correlation coefficient > 0.8, p < 0.05).

CASE REPORT: This is a case of vitreous hemorrhage with secondary AACG in an 80-year-old man who presented to the emergency department (ED) with pain and vision loss in his left eye after undergoing intravitreal injection to treat exudative macular degeneration. The diagnosis was made with the use of point-of-care ultrasound after intraocular pressure (IOP) was found to be significantly elevated in the left eye. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Emergency physicians should have a high level of suspicion for AACG in patients who are diagnosed with a vitreous hemorrhage after intravitreal injection and should immediately measure IOP for elevation upon presentation to the ED.,"Jersey, Andrew; Perice, Leland; Li, Nicole; Johnson, Jennifer; Dulani, Tina",J. emerg. med,,273
443106,"Development of a Salutogenesis Workshop for SPPs to Help Them, Their Athletes, and the Athlete's Entourage Better Cope With Uncertainty During the COVID-19 Pandemic",2021,"The nursing community in the United States polarized in September 2020 between Dawn Wooten's whistleblowing about forced hysterectomies at an immigration center in Georgia and the American Nurses Association's refusal to endorse a presidential candidate despite the Trump administration's mounting failures to address the public health crisis posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. This reveals a need for more attention to political aspects of health outcome inequities. As advocates for health equity, nurses can join in recent scholarship and activism concerning the political determinants of health. In this paper, we examine recent work on the political determinants of health with an aim to add two things. First, we seek to build further on the notion of ""political"" determinants of health by distinguishing policy and governance structures from dynamics of politicization through appeal to critical disabilities studies. Second, we seek to apply this further nuanced approach to challenge rhetorical uses of ""vulnerable populations,"" where this phrase serves to misrecognize systemic institutionalized forces that actively exploit and marginalize people and groups. By refocusing attention to political systems organized around and perpetuating inequitable health outcomes, nurses and other health care professionals-as well as those whom they serve-can concentrate their effort and power to act on political determinants of health in bringing about more equitable health outcomes.","Dickman, Nathan Eric; Chicas, Roxana",Nurs Inq,,273
444225,The generals and the war against COVID-19: The case of Zimbabwe,2020,"Post-mortem surveillance in Ireland discloses skin-test negative cattle with presumptive evidence of infection of Mycobacterium bovis (lesions at routine slaughter (LRS)), the causative agent of bovine tuberculosis (bTB). Laboratory confirmation of lesions has impacts on trade restrictions for herds, therefore if laboratory capacity was diminished, how herds are treated would require an informed risk policy. Here we report the proportion of herds with subsequent evidence of within-herd transmission, based on skin-test results. We assess how herd-size, herd-type, and bTB-history affect the probability of additional reactors at follow-up test using univariable and multivariable random-effects models. The study represents a rapid response to developing an evidential base for policy demands during an extraordinary event, the COVID-19 epidemic in Ireland. A dataset from 2005 to 2019 of breakdowns were collated. Overall, 20,116 breakdowns were initiated by LRS cases. During the index tests of these breakdowns, 3931 revealed &#8805;1 skin-test reactor animals (19.54%; &#8805;1 standard reactors: 3827; 19.02%). Increasing herd-size was associated with reactor disclosure on follow-up. For small herds (<33 animals), 11.74% of follow-up tests disclosed &#8805;1 reactor; 24.63% of follow-up tests from very large herds (>137) disclosed &#8805;1 reactors. Beef (13.87%) and ""other"" (13%) herd production types had lower proportion of index tests with reactors in comparison with dairy (28.27%) or suckler (20.48%) herds. Historic breakdown size during the previous 3-years was associated reactor disclosure risk on follow-up. Our results are useful for rapid tailored policy development aimed at identifying higher risk herds.","Byrne, Andrew W; Barrett, Damien; Breslin, Philip; Madden, Jamie M; O039,; Keeffe, James; Ryan, Eoin",Vet Res Commun,,273

It is therefore essential that patients receive comprehensive information about the risks and benefits of this approach compared with a formal surgical repair either by pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) and/or scleral buckling (SB). We report a retrospective case series of retinal detachments (RD) satisfying the strict selection criteria for PR but who were managed with formal surgery. Single-operation success rate for PPV/SB at six months follow-up was 93.8% in our study, higher than published primary success rates for PR (60-80%). When counselling patients for possible PR, the ease, speed and potentially reduced co-morbidity of an outpatient-based procedure needs to be balanced against its significantly higher failure rate in comparison with primary PPV/SB.","Kiew, G; Poulson, A V; Newman, D K; Alexander, P; Snead, M P",Med Leg J,,273

The guidelines, consensus statements, and preliminary recommendations published by the thoracic surgeons so far have appreciated the importance of triage of patients with thoracic surgical diseases and multidisciplinary team (MDT) meeting. Delaying surgery or planning alternative treatment in patient care should be done by taking input from experts in thoracic specialties. The procedures that can be carried out in a hospital are based on the prevalence of COVID-19 patients within the hospital and availability of hospital resources. As a result, proper triaging, ensuring safety of patient and health care personnel, and optimal utilization of the available resources remain the cornerstone while fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.

446493,Drive-thru pharmacy services: A way forward to combat COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Long endemicity of the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1 subtype in Egypt poses a lot of threats to public health. Contrary to what is previously known, outbreaks have been circulated continuously in the poultry sectors all year round without seasonality. These changes call the need for epidemiological studies to prove or deny the influence of climate variability on outbreak occurrence, which is the aim of this study. This work proposes a modern approach to examine the degree to which the HPAI-H5N1disease event is being influenced by climate variability as a potential risk factor using generalized estimating equations (GEEs). GEE model revealed that the effect of climate variability differs according to the timing of the outbreak occurrence. Temperature and relative humidity could have both positive and negative effects on disease events. During the cold seasons especially in the first quarter, higher minimum temperatures, consistently show higher risks of disease occurrence, because this condition stimulates viral activity, while lower minimum temperatures support virus survival in the other quarters of the year with the highest negative effect in the third quarter. On the other hand, relative humidity negatively affects the outbreak in the first quarter of the year as the humid weather does not support viral circulation, while the highest positive effect was found in the second quarter during which low humidity favors the disease event.","Elsobky, Yumna; El Afandi, Gamal; Abdalla, Ehsan; Byomi, Ahmed; Reddy, Gopal",PLoS One,,273

The present public health emergency associated with SARS-CoV-2 makes this topic critically important. Yet to be tested is the potential effectiveness of simple interventions that create an isolation zone (IZ) for a suspected/confirmed sick or sensitive person requiring quarantine. The intent in existing homes is to find a practical means to mitigate exposure to airborne contaminants. In creating an IZ in an occupied single-family home in the study, four simple strategies were tested. The test configurations were: (1) IZ windows closed with IZ bathroom exhaust ventilation fan off, (2) IZ windows closed with IZ exhaust fan on, (3) IZ window open with IZ exhaust fan off, and (4) IZ window open with IZ exhaust fan on. Incense-generated fine particulate matter (PM2.5) was used as a marker for virus transmission. The measured transfer of PM2.5 from the IZ into the main zone (MZ) of the house enabled us to determine the relative effectiveness of four containment strategies. Collectively, the data from pressure differential (across zones) and PM2.5 measurements suggested that the best containment strategy was achieved through continuously operating the bathroom exhaust fan while keeping the windows closed in the IZ (configuration 2). Interventions using open windows were found to be less reliable, due to variability in wind speed and direction, resulting in an unpredictable and sometimes detrimental pressure differential in the IZ with reference to MZ. Our findings strongly suggest a simple IZ exhaust ventilation strategy has the potential for mitigating the risk from the airborne spread of contaminants, such as SARS-CoV-2.","Khan, Tanvir R; Parker, Danny S; Withers, Charles",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,273

Due to physical distancing restrictions during the COVID-19 global pandemic, online multiplayer games like Minecraft and Roblox are well-positioned to amplify healthy communication/social connections and mitigate the impact of social isolation. Research so far has been focused on how these gaming environments support youth development from the perspectives of individual stakeholders (e.g., caregivers, educators, designers, and developers). However, features of these games, such as communication and parental controls, are often misaligned with the ways in which children develop communication and social skills. Using a series of case studies of popular virtual worlds and online games, this paper provides an analysis of critical design features that serve youth throughout different stages of childhood and early adolescence. We offer three main contributions: (a) a comparison matrix of similarities and differences in communication and control features between platforms;(b) an evaluation of design features in selected virtual world platforms that promote safe and positive social interactions;and (c) a method for cross-platform comparison aimed at helping researchers, designers, and practitioners examine specific dimensions of social communication and play experience in virtual worlds.","Du, Yao Grace Thomas D.; Jagannath, Krithika Salen-Tekinbas Katie",Multimodal Technologies and Interaction,,273

The resulting system is governed by a strongly coupled reaction-diffusion system with different diffusion coefficients. Global existence and uniqueness are established under certain assumptions on known data. Moreover, global asymptotic behavior of the solution is obtained when some parameters satisfy certain conditions. These results extend the existing results in the literature. The main tool used in this paper comes from the delicate theory of elliptic and parabolic equations. Moreover, the energy method and Sobolev embedding are used in deriving {\em apriori} estimates.

We propose a new fully automated deep learning framework for rapid quantification and differentiation between lung lesions in COVID-19 pneumonia from both contrast and non-contrast CT images using convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) networks. Utilizing the expert annotations, model training was performed 5 times with separate hold-out sets using 5-fold cross-validation to segment ground-glass opacity and high opacity (including consolidation and pleural effusion). The performance of the method was evaluated on CT data sets from 197 patients with positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test result for SARS-CoV-2. Strong agreement between expert manual and automatic segmentation was obtained for lung lesions with a Dice score coefficient of 0.876 $\pm$ 0.005; excellent correlations of 0.978 and 0.981 for ground-glass opacity and high opacity volumes. In the external validation set of 67 patients, there was dice score coefficient of 0.767 $\pm$ 0.009 as well as excellent correlations of 0.989 and 0.996 for ground-glass opacity and high opacity volumes. Computations for a CT scan comprising 120 slices were performed under 2 seconds on a personal computer equipped with NVIDIA Titan RTX graphics processing unit. Therefore, our deep learning-based method allows rapid fully-automated quantitative measurement of pneumonia burden from CT and may generate results with an accuracy similar to the expert readers.","Grodecki, Kajetan; Killekar, Aditya; Lin, Andrew; Cadet, Sebastien; McElhinney, Priscilla; Razipour, Aryabod; Chan, Cato; Pressman, Barry D.; Julien, Peter; Simon, Judit; Maurovich-Horvat, Pal; Gaibazzi, Nicola; Thakur, Udit; Mancini, Elisabetta; Agalbato, Cecilia; Munechika, Jiro; Matsumoto, Hidenari; Mene, Roberto; Parati, Gianfranco; Cernigliaro, Franco; Nerlekar, Nitesh; Torlasco, Camilla; Pontone, Gianluca; Dey, Damini; Slomka, Piotr J.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.00138v3.pdf,273

We also propose here a generalization of Gompertz law. Our data analysis permits an evaluation of the maximum number of infected individuals. The daily data must be compared with the obtained fits, to verify if the spreading is under control. From our analysis it appears that the spreading is reaching saturation in China, due to the strong containment policy of the national governments. In Singapore a large growth rate, recently observed, suggests the start of a new strong spreading. For South Korea and Italy, instead, the next data on new infections will be crucial to understand if the saturation will be reached for lower or higher numbers of infected individuals.","Castorina, P.; Iorio, A.; Lanteri, D.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.00507v2.pdf,273

The COVID-19 vaccine trials are high profile trials that have enrolled more than 100â¯000 participants. Consent documents must be succinct and understandable to ensure informed voluntary participation. Objective: To assess how well informed consent documents of the COVID-19 vaccine trials achieve the ideal of being succinct and understandable, and to create a shorter, more readable document. Design, Setting, and Participants: This quality improvement study collected and analyzed the informed consent documents used in 4 COVID-19 vaccine phase III randomized clinical trials to quantitatively assess readability and length and, based on this analysis, created a measurably more accessible informed consent document. Analysis was conducted from October 2020 to January 2021. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcomes were number of words (measured as word count), time-to-read (measured at reading speeds of 175-300 words per minute), language complexity (measured using Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level assessment), and readability (measured using Flesch Reading Ease Score). Secondary outcomes included clarity of how the placebo group could access the vaccine if it is proven safe and effective. The study also examined the length and readability of an improved consent document. Results: The 4 informed consent documents were a mean (range) of 8333 (7821 to 9340) words long, with a mean (range) 35 (32.6 to 38.9) minutes to read at 240 words per minute. All documents exceeded grade 9 language complexity and scored lower than 60 in the formal reading ease metric, which constitutes difficult. Only 1 document specified that participants in the placebo group might receive vaccine. It was possible to write a document in fewer than 3000 words with a grade 7 to 8 reading level and a formal readability score that was not difficult. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that existing COVID-19 vaccine informed consent documents were too long, difficult to read, and exceeded grade 9 in language complexity.

We aimed to define the effect of targeted biologic and immunomodulator therapy on risk of COVID-19 in a multi-institutional cohort of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: We identified patients 18 years and older who received care for IBD at Partners Healthcare between January 2019 and April 2020. The primary outcome was development of COVID-19 defined as a positive polymerase chain reaction test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Multivariable regression models were used to examine the effect of immunosuppression on risk of COVID-19 and its outcomes. RESULTS: In a cohort of 5302 IBD patients, 39 (0.7%) developed COVID-19. There was no difference in age, sex, or race between IBD patients with and without COVID-19. The rate of COVID-19 was similar between patients treated with immunosuppression (0.8%) compared with those who were not (0.64%; P = 0.55). After adjusting for age, sex, race, and comorbidities, use of immunosuppressive therapy was not associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 (odds ratio, 1.73; 95% confidence interval, 0.82-3.63). The presence of obesity was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 (odds ratio, 8.29; 95% confidence interval, 3.72-18.47). There were 7 hospitalizations, 3 intensive care unit stays, and 1 death. Older age and obesity but not immunosuppressive treatment were associated with severe COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: The use of systemic immunosuppression was not associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 in a multi-institutional cohort of patients with IBD.","Burke, Kristin E; Kochar, Bharati; Allegretti, Jessica R; Winter, Rachel W; Lochhead, Paul; Khalili, Hamed; Colizzo, Francis P; Hamilton, Matthew J; Chan, Walter W; Ananthakrishnan, Ashwin N",Inflamm. bowel dis,,273

453235,Investigating the status of prevention of coronavirus in industries,2020,"This manuscript provides guidance on the management of thyroid dysfunction during the COVID-19 pandemic. Autoimmune thyroid diseases are not linked to increased risks of COVID-19. Uncontrolled thyrotoxicosis may result in more severe complications from SARS-CoV-2 infection, including thyroid storm. The management of patients with a new diagnosis of hyperthyroidism is best undertaken with a block-and-replace regimen due to limited biochemical testing availability. Antithyroid drug (ATD)-induced neutropenia may favour the progression of COVID-19 and symptoms of infection may be confused with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The withdrawal of ATDs and urgent measurement of neutrophils should be considered in case of flu-like manifestations occurring in the initial months of treatment. Urgent surgery or 131-I may be undertaken in selected cases of uncontrolled thyrotoxicosis. Patients with COVID-19 infection may present with conjunctivitis, which could cause diagnostic difficulties in patients with new or existing Graves' ophthalmopathy.

453236,Investigating the status of prevention of coronavirus in industries,2020,"Superspreaders, infected individuals who result in an outsized number of secondary cases, are believed to underlie a significant fraction of total SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Here, we combine empirical observations of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 transmission and extreme value statistics to show that the distribution of secondary cases is consistent with being fat-tailed, implying that large superspreading events are extremal, yet probable, occurrences. We integrate these results with interaction-based network models of disease transmission and show that superspreading, when it is fat-tailed, leads to pronounced transmission by increasing dispersion. Our findings indicate that large superspreading events should be the targets of interventions that minimize tail exposure.","Wong, Felix; Collins, James J",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,,273

(Special Issue: Progress of tobacco control in the Western Pacific Region.),2020,"Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic around the world. With the explosive growth of confirmed cases, emergency medical supplies are facing global shortage, which restricts the treatment of seriously ill patients and protection of medical staff. Taking China, the United States, Australia, and Canada as examples, this study compares and analyzes the reserve and supply systems of emergency medical supplies and problems exposed in response to the COVID-19 epidemic. Some common problems were found, such as insufficient types and quantities of emergency medical supplies in reserve, insufficient emergency production capacity, and imperfect command mechanism for emergency supplies deployment and transportation. A sound reserve system of emergency medical supplies is the basis and guarantee for dealing with public health emergencies such as major outbreaks. Based on the comparison of systems and practical experience, countries around the world should further improve the reserve and supply system of emergency medical supplies, and improve the coordination and cooperation mechanism for emergency supplies for international public health emergencies, so as to cope with increasingly severe public health emergencies in the context of globalization.","Wang, Xu; Wu, Wenhui; Song, Peipei; He, Jiangjiang",Biosci Trends,,273
454098,Use of facemasks during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in China, leading to worldwide morbidity and mortality, including depression and anxiety. As the pandemic spread throughout Italy, mental health concerns increased for people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF), who are at greater risk. The aim was to pilot a Telehealth Psychological Support Intervention for pwCF and caregivers to reduce stress, depression, and anxiety during the lockdown in Italy in March 2020. METHODS: This intervention utilized cognitive behavioral skills (e.g., cognitive reframing). Participants included 16 pwCF and 14 parents, who completed four individual telehealth sessions with a psychologist. Stress ratings, Patient Health Questionnaire and General Anxiety Disorder, PHQ-8 and GAD-7, were completed, in addition to Feasibility and Satisfaction ratings. RESULTS: Ratings of stress significantly decreased from pre- to post-testing for pwCF (paired t(14) = -4.06, p < .01) and parents (paired t = -5.2, p < .001). A large percentage of both groups scored in the clinical range for depression and anxiety at baseline (pwCF: depression/anxiety = 71%; parents: depression = 57%; anxiety = 79%); a large proportion (20%-40%) reported moderate to severe symptomatology. Significant reductions in depression for pwCF were found (pre: M = 8.0 to post: M = 4.7; paired t(14) = 2.8, p < .05) but not anxiety (pre: M = 6.9 to post: M = 5.6, t(14) = 1.2, p = NS-non-significant). Parental depression decreased for parents (pre: M = 6.4 to post: M = 5.1, t(14) = -2.5, p < .05), but not anxiety (pre: M = 8.1 to post: M = 7.9, t(14) = -0.2, p = NS). Feasibility and Satisfaction were positive. CONCLUSION: This telehealth intervention yielded reductions in stress and depression for participants. Anxiety did not significantly decrease, possibly because COVID was ongoing. This feasible, satisfactory intervention was effective for improving mental health.","Graziano, Sonia; Boldrini, Francesca; Righelli, Dario; Milo, Francesco; Lucidi, Vincenzina; Quittner, Alexandra; Tabarini, Paola",Pediatr. pulmonol,,273

Three studies conducted during the mass spreading of the virus in the United States toward the end of March 2020 show that this results partially from people's misperception of the virus's exponential growth in linear terms and that overcoming this bias increases support for social distancing. Study 1 shows that American participants mistakenly perceive the virus's exponential growth in linear terms (conservatives more so than liberals). Studies 2 and 3 show that instructing people to avoid the exponential growth bias significantly increases perceptions of the virus's growth and thereby increases support for social distancing. Together, these results show the importance of statistical literacy to recruit support for fighting pandemics such as the coronavirus.","Lammers, Joris; Crusius, Jan; Gast, Anne",Proc. Natl. Acad.

Herein, we present a prospective analysis of epidemiological, clinical, radiological and laboratory data of consecutive adult cancer patients seen in the Clínico San Carlos University Hospital (Madrid, Spain), and admitted to hospital and tested for COVID-19 between February 21 and May 8, 2020 due to clinical suspicion of infection. Data from 73 patients with confirmed COVID-19 and active solid tumors or diagnosed within the previous 5 years were analyzed. The most frequent malignancy was lung cancer (19%) and 54 patients (74%) were on active cancer treatment. Most common findings on presentation included cough (55%), fever (52%), and dyspnea (45%), and 32 (44%) patients showed oxygen saturation levels below 95%. Radiologically, 54 (73%) patients presented an abnormal pattern, the most frequent being infiltrates (64%). 18 (24.7%) patients died in hospital and 55 (75.3%) were discharged with clinical resolution of the event. Multivariable logistic regression adjusted for age and tumor stage showed higher odds of in-hospital death associated with a history of cardiovascular disease, hospitalization in the previous 30 days, and several features on admission including dyspnea, higher qSOFA score, higher C-reactive protein levels, and an abnormal neutrophil count.

457955,How resilient is your team? Exploring healthcare providers' well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide pandemic in 2020. In response, most countries in the world implemented lockdowns, restricting their population's movements, work, education, gatherings, and general activities in attempt to ""flatten the curve"" of COVID-19 cases. The public health goal of lockdowns was to save the population from COVID-19 cases and deaths, and to prevent overwhelming health care systems with COVID-19 patients. In this narrative review I explain why I changed my mind about supporting lockdowns. The initial modeling predictions induced fear and crowd-effects (i.e., groupthink). Over time, important information emerged relevant to the modeling, including the lower infection fatality rate (median 0.23%), clarification of high-risk groups (specifically, those 70 years of age and older), lower herd immunity thresholds (likely 20-40% population immunity), and the difficult exit strategies. In addition, information emerged on significant collateral damage due to the response to the pandemic, adversely affecting many millions of people with poverty, food insecurity, loneliness, unemployment, school closures, and interrupted healthcare. Raw numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths were difficult to interpret, and may be tempered by information placing the number of COVID-19 deaths in proper context and perspective relative to background rates. Considering this information, a cost-benefit analysis of the response to COVID-19 finds that lockdowns are far more harmful to public health (at least 5-10 times so in terms of wellbeing years) than COVID-19 can be. Controversies and objections about the main points made are considered and addressed. Progress in the response to COVID-19 depends on considering the trade-offs discussed here that determine the wellbeing of populations. I close with some suggestions for moving forward, including focused protection of those truly at high risk, opening of schools, and building back better with a economy.","Joffe, Ari R",Front Public Health,,273

458231,Documenting COVID-19 screening before surgery during lockdown (COVID Screen): an audit with routinely collected health data,2020,"The initial investigation by local hospital attributed the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) to pneumonia with unknown cause that appeared like the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as public health emergency after it spread outside China to several countries. Thus, an assessment of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) with novel estimation approaches is essential to the global debate. This study is the first to develop both time series and panel data models to construct conceptual tools that examine the nexus between death from COVID-19 and confirmed cases. We collected daily data on four health indicators namely deaths, confirmed cases, suspected cases, and recovered cases across 31 Provinces/States in China. Due to the complexities of the COVID-19, we investigated the unobserved factors including environmental exposures accounting for the spread of the disease through human-to-human transmission. We used estimation methods capable of controlling for cross-sectional dependence, endogeneity, and unobserved heterogeneity. We predicted the impulse-response between confirmed cases of COVID-19 and COVID-19-attributable deaths. Our study revealed that the effect of confirmed cases on the novel coronavirus attributable deaths is heterogeneous across Provinces/States in China. We found a linear relationship between COVID-19 attributable deaths and confirmed cases whereas a nonlinear relationship was confirmed for the nexus between recovery cases and confirmed cases. The empirical evidence revealed that an increase in confirmed cases by 1% increases coronavirus attributable deaths by ~0.10%–~1.71% (95% CI). Our empirical results confirmed the presence of unobserved heterogeneity and common factors that facilitates the novel coronavirus attributable deaths caused by increased levels of confirmed cases. Yet, the role of such a medium that facilitates the transmission of COVID-19 remains unclear. We highlight safety precaution and preventive measures to circumvent the human-to-human transmission.COVID-19; Novel coronavirus disease; Cases of novel coronavirus; Modelling COVID-19; China; Econometrics; Economics; Environmental economics; Environmental science; Health economics; Public health.","Sarkodie, Samuel Asumadu; Owusu, Phebe Asantewaa",Heliyon,,273

We investigate if CCP transfusion in patients with severe respiratory failure increases plasma titres of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and improves clinical outcomes. METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 (n=34) were consented for CCP transfusion and serial blood draws pretransfusion and post-transfusion. Plasma SARS-CoV-2 antireceptor binding domain (RBD) IgG and IgM titres were measured by ELISA serially, and compared with serial plasma titre levels from control patients (n=68). The primary outcome was survival at 30 days, and secondary outcomes were length of ventilator and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support, length of stay (LOS) in the hospital and in the intensive care unit (ICU). Outcomes were compared with matched control patients (n=34). Kinetics of antibodies and clinical outcomes were compared using LOess regression and ORs, respectively. RESULTS: Prior to CCP transfusion, 74% of patients were anti-RBD seropositive for IgG (median 1:3200), and 81% were anti-RBD IgM seropositive (median 1:320), while 16% were seronegative. The kinetics of antibody titres in CCP recipients were similar to controls. CCP recipients presented with similar survival, duration on ventilatory and/or ECMO support, as well as ICU and hospital LOS compared with controls.

462258,Covid-19 and mobile phone hygiene in healthcare settings,2020,"BACKGROUND: As the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is widely spreading across the United States, there is a concern about the overloading of the nation's health care capacity. The expansion of telehealth services is expected to deliver timely care for the initial screening of symptomatic patients while minimizing exposure in health care facilities, to protect health care providers and other patients. However, it is currently unknown whether US hospitals have the telehealth capacity to meet the increasing demand and needs of patients during this pandemic. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the population-level internet search volume for telehealth (as a proxy of population interest and demand) with the number of new COVID-19 cases and the proportion of hospitals that adopted a telehealth system in all US states. METHODS: We used internet search volume data from Google Trends to measure population-level interest in telehealth and telemedicine between January 21, 2020 (when the first COVID-19 case was reported), and March 18, 2020. Data on COVID-19 cases in the United States were obtained from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resources Center. We also used data from the 2018 American Hospital Association Annual Survey to estimate the proportion of hospitals that adopted telehealth (including telemedicine and electronic visits) and those with the capability of telemedicine intensive care unit (tele-ICU). Pearson correlation was used to examine the relations of population search volume for telehealth and telemedicine (composite score) with the cumulative numbers of COVID-19 cases in the United States during the study period and the proportion of hospitals with telehealth and tele-ICU capabilities. RESULTS: We found that US population-level interest in telehealth increased as the number of COVID-19 cases increased, with a strong correlation (r=0.948, P<.001). We observed a higher population-level interest in telehealth in the Northeast and West census region, whereas the proportion of hospitals that adopted telehealth was higher in the Midwest region. There was no significant association between population interest and the proportion of hospitals that adopted telehealth (r=0.055, P=.70) nor hospitals having tele-ICU capability (r=-0.073, P=.61). CONCLUSIONS: As the number of COVID-19 cases increases, so does the US population's interest in telehealth. However, the level of population interest did not correlate with the proportion of hospitals providing telehealth services in the United States, suggesting that increased population demand may not be met with the current telehealth capacity. Telecommunication infrastructures in US hospitals may lack the capability to address the ongoing health care needs of patients with other health conditions. More practical investment is needed to deploy the telehealth system rapidly against the impending patient surge.","Hong, Young-Rock; Lawrence, John; Williams, Dunc; Mainous III, Arch",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,273

We also evaluated a primary school setting (with student-educator ratios 30:1, 15:1 and 8:1), including cohorts that alternate weekly. In the childcare centre setting, grouping siblings significantly reduced outbreak size and student-days lost. We identify an intensification cascade specific to classroom outbreaks of respiratory viruses with presymptomatic infection.

463984,Challenges and Concerns for Older Adults in India Regarding the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Social containment measures imposed in Europe during the lockdown to face COVID-19 pandemic can generate long-term potential threats for metabolic health. METHODS: A cohort of 494 non-COVID-19 subjects living in 21 EU countries were interviewed by an anonymous questionnaire exploring anthropometric and lifestyle changes during 1-month lockdown. A subgroup of 41 overweight/obese Italian subjects with previously diagnosed nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD) joined the study following a 12-month follow-up period promoting weight loss by healthy lifestyle. RESULTS: During the lockdown, body weight increased in 55% of subjects (average 2.4 ± 0.9 kg). Weight change increased with age, but not baseline body mass index. Subjects living in Italy had greater weight gain than those living in other European Countries. Weight gain during the lockdown was highest in subjects reporting no physical activity, and low adherence to Mediterranean diet. In the NAFLD group, weight gain occurred in 70% of cases. Subjects reporting weight loss during lockdown had decreased fatty liver score at 3 months before the lockdown, as compared with 1 year before. CONCLUSIONS: Strict measures of social containment-even short-term-pave the way to the increased risk of metabolic abnormalities in the medium-long term. In this context, adherence to Mediterranean diet and regular physical activity play a protective role both in terms of weight gain and fatty liver development/progression, with implication for primary and secondary prevention. When adopting measures imposing social containment, intensive educational campaigns must increase public awareness about beneficial effects of healthy lifestyles.","Shanmugam, Harshitha; Di Ciaula, Agostino; Di Palo, Domenica Maria; Molina-Molina, Emilio; Garruti, Gabriella; Faienza, Maria Felicia; vanErpecum, Karel; Portincasa, Piero",Eur J Clin Invest,,273

The aim of our systematic review was to investigate symptoms and diagnostic-therapeutic management of IBD patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and MedRxiv up to July 29, 2020, to identify all studies reporting clinical information on adult and pediatric IBD patients with confirmed COVID-19. RESULTS: Twenty-three studies met our inclusion criteria, including 243,760 IBD patients. COVID-19 was diagnosed in 1028 patients (509 with Crohn's disease [49.5%], 428 with ulcerative colitis [41.6%], 49 with indeterminate colitis [4.8%], and 42 with missing data [4.1%]), accounting for a cumulative prevalence of 0.4%. Viral infection occurred more frequently in males than in females (56.5% vs 39.7%), and the mean age ranged from 14 to 85 years. The most common symptoms were fever (48.3%), cough (46.5%), and diarrhea (20.5%), and a COVID-19 diagnosis was achieved mainly through polymerase chain reaction analysis of nasopharyngeal swabs (94.4%) and chest computed tomography scans (38.9%). Hydroxychloroquine (23.9%), lopinavir/ritonavir (8.2%), steroids (3.2%), and antibiotics (3.1%) were the most used drugs. Overall, approximately a third of patients were hospitalized (30.6%), and 11.4% of them required admission to the intensive care unit. In total, 29 COVID-19-related deaths were reported (3.8%), and increasing age and the presence of comorbidities were recognized as risk factors for COVID-19 and negative outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Diarrhea occurs more frequently in IBD patients with COVID-19 than in the non-IBD population. Further studies are needed to define the optimal diagnostic-therapeutic approach in IBD patients with COVID-19.","D039,; Amico, Ferdinando; Danese, Silvio; Peyrin-Biroulet, Laurent",Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol,,273

Thus, the present study sets out to scrutinize the fraud pentagon theory on fraudulent financial statements. Each element is not able to be tested directly. However, there are proxies. The pressure element is providing as a personal financial need. The opportunity is becoming the industry’s nature. Each of the quality of the external auditors as well as the turnover of board directors proposes rationalization and competence. The quantity of CEO’s appearance in photos is a proxy of arrogance. The testing was carried out on the registered pharmaceutical companies of the Indonesian stock exchange in the span of the 2015-2019 periods. The samples were selected by the means of sampling technique which is purposive. Data are scrutinized by the means of panel data regression. The analysis results show that the characteristic of the industry positively affects financial reports which are fraudulent. Changing top management positions such as directors can be an indication of financial reports which are fraudulent.

In addition, we aimed to identify clinical predictors for a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) swab result. Patients underwent informal triage, standardized history taking, and physician evaluation, only where indicated. Patients were observed for 30 days. Safety was the primary outcome and was defined as a COVID-19-related 30 day re-presentation rate <5% and mortality rate <1% in patients presenting to the TTC. Feasibility was defined as an overruling of informal triage <5%. Among 4815 presentations, 572 (11.9%) were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and 4774 were discharged. Mortality at 30-days was 0.04% (2 patients, one of which related to COVID-19). Fever (OR 2.03 [95% CI 1.70;2.42]), myalgia (OR 1.94 [1.63;2.31]), chills (OR 1.77 [1.44;2.16]), headache (OR 1.61 [1.34;1.94]), cough (OR 1.50 [1.24;1.83]), weakness (OR 1.46 [1.21;1.76]), and confusion (OR 1.39 [1.06;1.80]) were associated with test positivity. Re-presentation rate was 8% overall and 1.4% in COVID-19 related re-presentation (69 of 4774). The overruling rate of informal triage was 1.5%. According to our study, a low-threshold testing process in a TTC appeared to be safe (low re-presentation and low mortality) and is feasible (low overruling of informal triage).

Membrane-bound ACE2 is depleted as a result of this entry mechanism. The consequence is that the protective renin-angiotensin system (RAS), of which ACE2 is an essential component, is compromised through lack of production of the protective peptides angiotensin-(1-7) and angiotensin-(1-9), and therefore decreased stimulation of Mas (receptor Mas) and angiotensin AT2-receptors (AT2Rs), while angiotensin AT1-receptors (AT1Rs) are overstimulated due to less degradation of angiotensin II (Ang II) by ACE2. The protective RAS has numerous beneficial actions, including anti-inflammatory, anti-coagulative, anti-fibrotic effects along with endothelial and neural protection; opposite to the deleterious effects caused by heightened stimulation of angiotensin AT1R. Given that patients with severe COVID-19 exhibit an excessive immune response, endothelial dysfunction, increased clotting, thromboses and stroke, enhancing the activity of the protective RAS is likely beneficial. In this article, we discuss the evidence for a dysfunctional protective RAS in COVID and develop a rationale that the protective RAS imbalance in COVID-19 may be corrected by using AT2R agonists. We further review preclinical studies with AT2R agonists which suggest that AT2R stimulation may be therapeutically effective to treat COVID-19-induced disorders of various organ systems such as lung, vasculature, or the brain. Finally, we provide information on the design of a clinical trial in which patients with COVID-19 were treated with the AT2R agonist Compound 21 (C21). This trial has been completed, but results have not yet been reported.","Steckelings, U Muscha; Sumners, Colin",Clin Sci (Lond),,273
475394,How The Covid-19 Pandemic Affected The Physical Activity Of Different Members Of A University Community,2021,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) entry factors, ACE2 and TMPRSS2, are highly expressed in nasal epithelial cells. However, the association between SARS-CoV-2 and nasal inflammation in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) has not been investigated. We thus investigated the expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors in nasal tissues of CRSwNP patients, and their associations with inflammatory endotypes of CRSwNP. METHODS: The expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was assessed in nasal tissues of control subjects and eosinophilic CRSwNP (ECRSwNP) and nonECRSwNP patients. The correlations between ACE2/TMPRSS2 expression and inflammatory indices of CRSwNP endotypes were evaluated. Regulation of ACE2/TMPRSS2 expression by inflammatory cytokines and glucocorticoids was investigated. RESULTS: ACE2 expression was significantly increased in nasal tissues of nonECRSwNP patients compared to ECRSwNP patients and control subjects, and positively correlated with the expression of IFN-Î³, but negatively correlated with tissue infiltrated eosinophils, and expression of IL5 and IL13. IFN-Î³ up-regulated ACE2 expression while glucocorticoid attenuated this increase in cultured nasal epithelial cells. Genes co-expressed with ACE2 were enriched in pathways relating to defence response to virus in nasal tissue. TMPRSS2 expression was decreased in nasal tissues of CRSwNP patients compared to control subjects and not correlated with the inflammatory endotypes of CRSwNP. Glucocorticoid treatment decreased ACE2 expression in nasal tissues of nonECRSwNP patients, but not in ECRSwNP patients, whereas TMPRSS2 expression was not affected. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that ACE2 expression, regulated by IFN-Î³, is increased in nasal tissues of nonECRSwNP patients and positively correlates with type 1 inflammation.","Wang, Ming; Bu, Xiangting; Fang, Gaoli; Luan, Ge; Huang, Yanran; Akdis, Cezmi A; Wang, Chengshuo; Zhang, Luo",Allergy,,273

Esta puede conducir al síndrome distrés respiratorio agudo (SDRA). Frente a su sintomatología severa, la ventilación mecánica (VM), y sus valores de mecánica ventilatoria aparecen como una herramienta fundamental. Un complemento, para analizar el estado de avance de esta patología es la radiografía de tórax (RT), aunque en ocasiones esta depende de la experiencia del equipo de salud. Así el objetivo de esta investigación fue explorar la relación de las medidas de mecánica ventilatoria y radiográficas con el tiempo de conexión a VM en pacientes COVID-19. Estudio retrospectivo, que incluyó a 23 pacientes en VM. Se recolectó información de variables de mecánica ventilatoria; PEEP, presión plateau, presión de distensión y compliance estática. Desde la RT se midió, altura y ancho pulmonar, ángulo costodiafragmático y espacio intercostal. Los resultados indicaron que las variables de mecánica ventilatoria tales como el PEEP y el plateau se relacionaron significativamente con el tiempo de conexión a VM (r=0,449; p=0,035 y r=0,472; p=0,026), mientras que las variables radiográficas construidas en base al ángulo costodiafragmático y el espacio intercostal presentaron similares comportamientos (r= 0,462; p=0,046 y r=-0,543; p=0,009). En conclusión, la presión resultante de la programación del ventilador mecánico junto a cambios estructurales observados en la RT, se relacionan con el tiempo de conexión a VM.","Muñoz-Cofré, Rodrigo; Araneda-Madrid, Patricio; del Sol, Mariano; Álvarez-Pérez, Felipe; Pérez-Riquelme, Camilo; Escobar-Cabello, Máximo; Valenzuela-Vásquez, Jorge",Int. j. morphol,,273

ESGE recommended reduction of non-emergency endoscopies, personal protection measures (PPM) and post-endoscopy calls to patients, to check their COVID-19 status. This study aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on endoscopy during the first European lockdown (March-May 2020). Methods Demographic data, patients' COVID-19 status before and after endoscopy, clinical data for those developingCOVID-19, implementation of PPM, number and type of overall endoscopies, as well as information for possible COVID-19infection of patients and PEU were retrospectively recorded. Results 1267 endoscopies (EGDs:46 %, colonoscopies/rectosigmoidoscopies:35 %, ERCPs:14 %, EUS:4 %) were performedin 1222 patients (mean age:63.4 y.o., males:59 %, inpatients:44 %) in 9 centers (6 countries). Pre-endoscopic testing forCOVID-19 was available for 326 (26.7 %) patients;87(7 %) tested positive. 7-14 days after endoscopy, 1204 patients werecontacted by telephone. Among 1135 pre-endoscopically COVID-19 negative patients 254 were tested post-endoscopy and8 were found positive (0.6 % of the total), with 6, 1 and 1 cases turning positive after EGD, colonoscopy and EUS,respectively. Of these, 4 were considered “obviously” irrelevant to endoscopy, but for the other 4 (3 post-EGD and 1 post-colonoscopy) the route of transmission remained obscure. Appropriate PPM were implemented and adhered to in allcenters;moreover, a significant reduction in the number of endoscopies was noted in all centers after March 2020. Finally,data regarding 163 PEU was recorded;5 (3 %) tested positive during the study period. In 4 of them (2 % of the total), theinfection was considered to be associated to their work environment. Conclusions COVID-19 transmission in endoscopic units is highly unlikely in a lockdown setting, provided endoscopies arereduced to emergency cases and appropriate PPM are implemented and followed.","Papanikolaou, I.; Chatzidakis, A.; Miltiadou, K.; Facciorusso, A.; Crinò, S.

During the pandemic, people with high coronavirus stress are at risk of experiencing poor subjective well-being. There is no research investigating the role of meaning-based coping and spirituality in explaining the link between coronavirus stress and subjective well-being. This study examined the mediating roles of meaning-based coping and spiritual well-being in the link between coronavirus stress and subjective well-being in young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. The sample included 427 young adults (71% female), ranging in age between 18 and 48 years (M = 21.06;SD = 2.62). Turkish young adults completed an online survey, including measures of coronavirus stress, subjective well-being, meaning-based coping, and spiritual well-being. The results indicate that greater meaning-based coping and spiritual well-being mediated decreases in the adverse impacts of coronavirus stress on subjective well-being.

482021,Short-Pulse Lasers: A Versatile Tool in Creating Novel Nano-/Micro-Structures and Compositional Analysis for Healthcare and Wellbeing Challenges,2021,"BACKGROUND: Pathology and imaging tests are frequently requested in the outpatient setting despite historically poor completion rates. The impact of COVID-19 telehealth on test completion rates is unknown. AIMS: To examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and telehealth transition on pathology and imaging test request and completion rates in Australian outpatient clinics. METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study with historical controls between March-May 2019 and March-May 2020. Pathology and imaging request and completion rates were collected in review consultation patients attending Gastroenterology and Rheumatology outpatient clinics at a tertiary healthcare system prior and during the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic in Melbourne. RESULTS: 1376 patients were included in the study. Pathology tests were requested more frequently in the COVID-19 group (n = 582/684, 85.2%) than control group (n = 492/692, 71.1%, p < 0.001) but completion rates were lower in the COVID-19 group (n = 443/582, 76.1%) than control group (n = 426/492 (86.6%), p < 0.001). Imaging tests were requested more frequently in the COVID-19 group (n = 345/682, 50.6%) than control group (n = 295/692, 42.6%, p = 0.003) with lower rates of completion in the COVID-19 group (n = 229/345, 66.4%) then control group (n = 247/295, 83.7%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic and telehealth transition has resulted in more frequent pathology and imaging requests but fewer test completion in the outpatients setting. This study has identified new clinical risks associated with the abrupt transition to telehealth during COVID-19 that should be explored in future studies and appropriately mitigated.

483838,Underperformance of Reverse-Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction in Japan and Potential Implications From Diamond Princess Cruise Ship and Other Countries During the Ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the pathogen responsible for the global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). From the first reported cases in December 2019, the virus has spread to over 4 million people worldwide. Human-to-human transmission occurs mainly through the aerosolization of respiratory droplets. Transmission also occurs through contact with contaminated surfaces and other fomites. Improved antisepsis of human and nonhuman surfaces has been identified as a key feature of transmission reduction. There are no previous studies of povidone iodine (PVP-I) against SARS-CoV-2. This study evaluated nasal and oral antiseptic formulations of PVP-I for virucidal activity against SARS-CoV-2. This is the first report on the efficacy of PVP-I against the virus that causes COVID-19. METHODS: Povidone iodine nasal antiseptic formulations and PVP-I oral rinse antiseptic formulations from 1% to 5% concentrations as well as controls were studied for virucidal efficacy against the SARS-CoV-2. Test compounds were evaluated for ability to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 as measured in a virucidal assay. SARS-CoV-2 was exposed directly to the test compound for 60 seconds, compounds were then neutralized, and surviving virus was quantified. RESULTS: All concentrations of nasal antiseptics and oral rinse antiseptics evaluated completely inactivated the SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: Nasal and oral PVP-I antiseptic solutions are effective at inactivating the SARS-CoV-2 at a variety of concentrations after 60-second exposure times. The formulations tested may help to reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 if used for nasal decontamination, oral decontamination, or surface decontamination in known or suspected cases of COVID-19.","Pelletier, Jesse S; Tessema, Belachew; Frank, Samantha; Westover, Jonna B; Brown, Seth M; Capriotti, Joseph A",Ear Nose Throat J,,273

Due to the similarity of symptoms with those of common gastrointestinal disorders, this infection is often underestimated, and the need for new specific diagnostic tools is becoming crucial. Given the remarkable impact that MALDI-TOF MS biotyping had in the last decade in clinical routine practice for the recognition of bacterial and fungi strains, a similar scenario could be foreseen for the identification of parasites, such as nematodes. In this work, a MALDI-TOF MS profiling of Anisakis proteome was pursued with a view to constructing a first spectral library for the diagnosis of Anisakis infections. At the same time, a shotgun proteomics approach by LC-ESI-MS/MS was performed on the two main fractions obtained from protein extraction, to evaluate the protein species enriched by the protocol. A set of MALDI-TOF MS signals associated with proteins originating in the ribosomal fraction of the nematode extract was selected as a potential diagnostic tool for the identification of Anisakis spp.","Marzano, Valeria; Pane, Stefania; Foglietta, Gianluca; Levi Mortera, Stefano; Vernocchi, Pamela; Onetti Muda, Andrea; Putignani, Lorenza",,,273

The COVID-19 pandemic has created unimaginable and unprecedented global health crisis. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, millions of dollars have been spent, hospitalization overstretched with increasing morbidity and mortality. All these have resulted in unprecedented global economic catastrophe. Several drugs and vaccines are currently being evaluated, tested, and administered in the frantic efforts to stem the dire consequences of COVID-19 with varying degrees of successes. Zinc possesses potential health benefits against COVID-19 pandemic by improving immune response, minimizing infection and inflammation, preventing lung injury, inhibiting viral replication through the interference of the viral genome transcription, protein translation, attachment, and host infectivity. However, this review focuses on the various mechanisms of action of zinc and its supplementation as adjuvant for vaccines an effective therapeutic regimen in the management of the ravaging COVID-19 pandemic. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent for the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), has brought unprecedented untold hardship to both developing and developed countries. The global race for vaccine development against COVID-19 continues with success in sight with attendant increasing hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality. Available drugs with anti-inflammatory actions have become alternative to stem the tide of COVID-19 with attendant global financial crises. However, Zinc is known to modulate several physiological functions including intracellular signaling, enzyme function, gustation, and olfaction, as well as reproductive, skeletal, neuronal, and cardiovascular systems. Hence, achieving a significant therapeutic approach against COVID-19 could imply the use of zinc as a supplement together with available drugs and vaccines waiting for emergency authorization to win the battle of COVID-19. Together, it becomes innovative and creative to supplement zinc with currently available drugs and vaccines.","Oyagbemi, Ademola Adetokunbo; Ajibade, Temitayo Olabisi; Aboua, Yapo Guillaume; Gbadamosi, Idayat Titilayo; Adedapo, Aduragbenro Deborah A; Aro, Abimbola Obemisola; Adejumobi, Olumuyiwa Abiola; Thamahane-Katengua, Emma; Omobowale, Temidayo Olutayo; Falayi, Olufunke Olubunmi; Oyagbemi, Taiwo Olaide; Ogunpolu, Blessing Seun; Hassan, Fasilat Oluwakemi; Ogunmiluyi, Iyanuoluwa Omolola; Ola-Davies, Olufunke Eunice; Saba, Adebowale Benard; Adedapo, Adeolu Alex; Nkadimeng, Sanah Malomile; McGaw, Lyndy Joy; Kayoka-Kabongo, Prudence Ngalula; Oguntibeju, Oluwafemi Omoniyi; Yakubu, Momoh Audu",J Food Biochem,,273

METHODS: Population-based retrospective cohort study involving 79,071 adults &#8805;50 years-old in Tarragona region (Southern Catalonia, Spain). Cohort characteristics (age, sex, residence, vaccinations history and comorbidities) were established at baseline, and Covid-19 cases occurring between 01/03/2020-30/04/2020 were registered. Cox regression analysis calculating Hazard ratios (HRs) adjusted by age, sex and comorbidities was used to estimate risk for Covid-19. RESULTS: Across study period, 1,547 cohort members were PCR tested (22.6% positive) and 367 were presumptive cases without PCR tested. Considering PCR-confirmed Covid-19, incidence (per 100,000 persons-period) was 441 overall (248, 141, 424, 1,303 and 3,135 in 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, 80-89 and &#8805;90 years-old, respectively; 380 in men and 497 in women; 259 in community-dwelling and 10,571 in nursing-home). By comorbidities, maximum incidence emerged among persons with neurological disease (2,723), atrial fibrillation (1,348), chronic renal failure (1,050), cardiac disease (856), respiratory disease (798) and diabetes (706). Lower incidence appeared in rheumatic diseases (230) and smokers (180). In multivariable analysis focused on community-dwelling individuals (N=77,671), only cardiac disease (HR: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.01-2.15; p=0.045) and respiratory disease (HR: 1.75; 95% CI: 1.00-3.02; p=0.051) were associated with an increased risk, whereas smoking (HR:0.43; 95% CI: 0.25-0.74; p=0.002) and influenza vaccinated (HR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.43-0.92; p=0.015) appeared associated with a decreased risk.

494609,Reduction in healthcare services during the COVID-19 pandemic in China,2020,"As in other Hymenoptera, adult ants cannot secrete silk, unlike the larvae that spin a cocoon prior to metamorphosis. Fisher and Robertson (1999) first showed the existence of a silk gland in the head of adult Melissotarsus beccarii workers, and we confirm this with detailed histology and ultrastructural comparisons of both queens and workers. This African genus exhibits extreme morphological adaptations (legs, head shape and mandibular muscles) for tunnelling behaviour inside living trees, that underlie an obligate mutualism with scale insects. Rhopalomastix is its sister genus distributed across Asia, and we show that queens and workers also have a silk gland. This lineage of minute workers relies on silk to secure their network of tunnels against other arboreal ants. We show striking differences between these genera in the anatomy and ultrastructure of the cells that secrete silk, especially numerous vacuoles and an unexpectedly branched end apparatus in Melissotarsus. Moreover, the legs of Melissotarsus are much more specialized for tunnelling, and this includes highly expanded basitarsi. The latter house the novel 'Delage-Darchen gland', and we document its anatomy and ultrastructure, suggesting a proteinaceous secretion to harden roofs made of silk combined with wood fragments. The restriction of the Delage-Darchen gland to Melissotarsus, combined with a modified silk gland (an almost three-fold increase in the number of secretory cells, and ultrastructural differences suggestive of higher secretory activity), are evidence of an outstanding evolutionary divergence relative to Rhopalomastix. Synthesis of silk by adults is a significant innovation among ants, but its augmented production in Melissotarsus makes them better adapted for the hazards of arboreal life.","Billen, Johan; Peeters, Christian",Arthropod Struct Dev,,273

METHODS: Participants were 100 residents and 102 staff from four co-located care homes in Wales. Data were collected from the homes and Public Health Wales, including demographics, presentations, test status and results, hospital admissions and deaths. Genomic sequencing of confirmed case samples was completed, where possible. Epi-curves, crude attack rates, a Kaplan-Meier survival curve and adjusted hazard ratios were calculated using R. RESULTS: About 14 confirmed and 43 possible resident cases, 23 confirmed and 47 possible staff cases occurred. Crude attack rates of possible and confirmed cases were 57% (residents) and 69% (staff). Genomic sequencing for 10 confirmed case PCR samples identified at least 5 different UK lineages of COVID-19.42 (42%) residents died, 23 (55%) with COVID-19 or suspected COVID-19 recorded on the death certificate. The hazard ratio for death amongst resident possible and confirmed cases compared to null cases, adjusting for age and sex, was 13.26 (95% CI 5.61-31.34). CONCLUSIONS: There were extensive outbreaks of COVID-19 in these homes with high crude attack rates and deaths. Universal testing and early isolation of residents are recommended.","Williams, O; Williams, C; Turner, D; Bull, M; Watkins, J; Hurt, L",J. public health (Oxf),,273

In March 2020, even before the first case of COVID-19 was registered, some African countries implemented total lockdown measures, which limited movement of people, banned mass gatherings, and closed schools and borders. However, these control measures, which affect individuals and society's well-being, cannot be implemented for a long time. There is an urgent need for a robust framework to guide African countries to make evidence-based decisions on easing these restrictive measures and reapply them when the infection rates increase significantly. This article presents a proposed framework to guide lockdown easing while limiting the community spread of COVID-19 in Africa. Due to lack of information on the impact of relaxing restrictions on peoples' movement on the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent for COVID-19) and how businesses will respond, it is almost clear that there is no single grand lockdown exit strategy. African governments should develop flexible, iterative lockdown exit plans based on epidemiological disease data, economic indicators, and peoples' views to inform decisions, all of which are paramount for success. A phased approach of changes and willingness to adapt methods will allow governments to minimize the pandemic's adverse impact and respond accordingly as new control tools become available.","Ikoona, Eric Nzirakaindi; Kitara, David Lagoro",Pan Afr Med J,,273

It draws on a survey sample of n = 1553 educators and trainers working in Singapore and their perspectives on how a migration to online LTA is producing long-term, if not permanent, changes to the organisation and delivery of post-secondary education and training. It reveals a largely positive view of digital resettlement of education and training in Singapore as a consequence of COVID-19. Yet despite the articulation by respondents of ‘paradigm change’ and ‘education without limits’, we find that an embrace of digitalisation is mobilised (and manipulated) not so much by pedagogical concerns but by economic ambitions and a utilitarian logic common to the neoliberal incantations of a global education policy community.

507176,COVID-19 and telemedicine: Immediate action required for maintaining healthcare providers well-being,2020,"It can be life-saving to monitor the respiratory rate (RR) even for healthy people in real-time. It is reported that the infected people with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), generally develop mild respiratory symptoms in the early stage. It will be more important to continuously monitor the RR of people in nursing homes and houses with a non-contact method. Conventional, contact-based, methods are not suitable for long-term health monitoring especially in-home care services. The potentials of wireless radio signals for health care applications, such as fall detection, etc., are examined in literature. In this paper, we focus on a device-free real-time RR monitoring system using wireless signals. In our recent study, we proposed a non-contact RR monitoring system with a batch processing (delayed) estimation method. In this paper, for real-time monitoring, we modify the standard joint unscented Kalman filter (JUKF) method for this new and time-critical problem. Due to the nonlinear structure of the RR estimation problem with respect to the measurements, a novel modification is proposed to transform measurement errors into parameter errors by using the hyperbolic tangent function. It is shown in the experiments conducted with the real measurements taken using healthy volunteers that the proposed modified joint unscented Kalman filter (ModJUKF) method achieves the highest accuracy according to the windowing-based methods in the time-varying RR scenario. It is also shown that the ModJUKF not only reduces the computational complexity approximately 8.54% but also improves the accuracy 36.7% with respect to the standard JUKF method.","Uysal, Can; Onat, Altan; Filik, Tansu",IEEE Access,,273

509452,PIN34 COVID 19 – What Is the Health-Economic Economically Justifiable Price of Lockdown?,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To review all available original publications on the harms and benefits of subcutaneous (SC) hydration in older patients. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. PARTICIPANTS: All studies on SC hydration in older patients without restrictions on design or language. MEASUREMENTS: The Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science databases and trial registries were searched from inception to November 5, 2019, and two reviewers independently extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias of individual outcomes. RESULTS: Thirty-one publications from 29 studies met the eligibility criteria. The data from six randomized controlled trials were used for the meta-analyses. The subgroup analysis including only the studies with the lowest risk of bias showed that SC hydration was associated with fewer adverse effects than intravenous (IV) hydration (risk ratio (RR) = 0.69; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.53-0.88; P = .003; n = 4; I2 = 0.0%; 545 infusions in each group). In absolute numbers, patients treated with SC hydration had an incidence rate of 90 adverse effects per 1,000 infusions versus 130 adverse effects per 1,000 infusions (95% CI = 102-169) with IV hydration. Secondary outcomes comparing IV with SC hydration showed that SC was 3.2 minutes faster to set up and markedly reduced the risk of agitation (RR = 0.42; 95% CI = 0.22-0.79; P = .007; I2 = 65%; n = 3); however, SC hydration delivered a lower volume of fluid and was less efficient at reducing serum osmolality (s-osmolality). CONCLUSIONS: SC hydration is safer than IV hydration and potentially reduces the risk of agitation, but it is less effective. SC hydration should be available as an alternative to IV hydration when treating older patients for mild-to-moderate dehydration. More high-quality studies are needed in the field to increase the confidence in the estimates.","Danielsen, Mathias Brix; Andersen, Stig; Worthington, Elisa; Jorgensen, Martin Gronbech",J Am Geriatr Soc,,273

METHODS: Retrospective, observational, cohort study of pediatric patients with IBD, receiving infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, or ustekinumab for at least 2âmonths. Data related to the immediate and delayed adverse events (AEs) were collected, focusing on the reaction type and severity, the time of onset, the outcome and the temporary or definitive therapy discontinuation secondary to the AE. Number of suspected and confirmed coronavirus disease-209 (COVID-19) cases and their outcomes, as well as flu vaccination coverage were collected. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-five children were included (101 [55%] CD, 82 [44%] UC, and 2 [1%] IBDU): 149 received infliximab (IFX) (81%), 88 (48%) adalimumab (ADA), 18 (21%) vedolizumab, and 4 (2%) ustekinumab. The overall AE rates were 49%, 67% of whom likely medication-related. Eleven (6%) patients experienced more than 1 AE, 18 patients (10%) presented an immediate reaction, and 82 (45%) a delayed AE. Among the 90 patients experiencing at least 1 AE, 97% had mild-to-moderate AEs. Only 4 SAEs were reported (4%). Treatment discontinuation because of AE occurred in 25 patients (14%). Four COVID-19 cases were reported, all with a mild course. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm a good safety profile of biologics. Infusion reactions to IFX administration remain one of the main issues, significantly linked to its immunogenicity and consequently with an impact on its efficacy and durability.","D039,; Arcangelo, Giulia; Distante, Manuela; Raso, Tonia; Rossetti, Danilo; Catassi, Giulia; Aloi, Marina",J. pediatr. gastroenterol. nutr,,273
511514,Looking inside the 'black box' of vaccine hesitancy: unlocking the effect of psychological attitudes and beliefs on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and implications for public health communication,2021,"Anecdotal evidence rapidly accumulated during March 2020 from sites around the world that sudden hyposmia and hypogeusia are significant symptoms associated with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Our objective was to describe the prevalence of hyposmia and hypogeusia and compare it in hospitalized and non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients to evaluate an association of these symptoms with disease severity. We performed a cross-sectional survey during 5 consecutive days in March 2020, within a tertiary referral center, associated outpatient clinic, and two primary care outpatient facilities in Paris. All SARS-CoV-2-positive patients hospitalized during the study period and able to be interviewed (n = 198), hospital outpatients seen during the previous month (n = 129), and all COVID-19-highly suspect patients in two primary health centers (n = 63) were included. Hospitalized patients were significantly more often male (64 vs 40%) and older (66 vs 43 years old in median) and had significantly more comorbidities than outpatients. Hyposmia and hypogeusia were reported by 33% of patients and occurred significantly less frequently in hospitalized patients (12% and 13%, respectively) than in the health centers' outpatients (33% and 43%, respectively) and in the hospital outpatients (65% and 60%, respectively). Hyposmia and hypogeusia appeared more frequently after other COVID-19 symptoms. Patients with hyposmia and/or hypogeusia were significantly younger and had significantly less respiratory severity criteria than patients without these symptoms. Olfactory and gustatory dysfunction occurs frequently in COVID-19, especially in young, non-severe patients. These symptoms might be a useful tool for initial diagnostic work-up in patients with suspected COVID-19.","Nouchi, Agathe; Chastang, Julie; Miyara, Makoto; Lejeune, Julie; Soares, André; Ibanez, Gladys; Saadoun, David; Morélot-Panzini, Capucine; Similowski, Thomas; Amoura, Zahir; Boddaert, Jacques; Caumes, Eric; Bleibtreu, Alexandre; Lorenzo, Alain; Tubach, Florence; Pourcher, Valérie",Eur. j. clin. microbiol. infect. dis,,273

511541,How pets factor into healthcare decisions for COVID-19: A One Health perspective,2020,"BACKGROUND: Since December 2019, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has affected over 50 000 people in Wuhan, China. However, the number of daily infection cases, hospitalization rate, lag time from onset to diagnosis date and their associations with measures introduced to slow down the spread of COVID-19 have not been fully explored. METHODS: This study recruited 6872 COVID-19 patients in the Wuchang district, Wuhan. All of the patients had an onset date from 21 December 2019 to 23 February 2020. The overall and weekly hospitalization rate and lag time from onset to diagnosis date were calculated. The number of daily infections was estimated by the back-projection method based on the number of daily onset cases. Their association with major government reactions and measures was analyzed narratively. RESULTS: The overall hospitalization rate was 45.9% (95% CI 44.7 to 47.1%) and the mean lag time from onset to diagnosis was 11.1±7.4 d. The estimated infection curve was constructed for the period from 14 December 2019 to 23 February 2020. Raising public awareness regarding self-protecting and social distancing, as well as the provision of timely testing and inpatient services, were coincident with the decline in the daily number of infections. CONCLUSION: Early public awareness, early identification and early quarantine, supported by appropriate infrastructure, are important elements for containing the spread of COVID-19 in the community.","Li, Wei-Ying; Dai, Yong; Chau, Pui-Hing; Yip, Paul S F",International health (Online),,273

Methods: We retrospectively retrieved data of inpatients with COVID-19 from January 21st to March 14th, 2020, and CAP from November 1st, 2019 to December 31st, 2019 in Wuhan Children's Hospital. We divided CAP into mycoplasma pneumonia and other viral pneumonia. We analyzed clinical and radiological features from those patients, and compared the differences among COVID-19, mycoplasma pneumonia and other viral pneumonia. Results: Eighty COVID-19 inpatients from January 21st to March 14th, 2020, as well as 95 inpatients with mycoplasma pneumonia and 50 inpatients with other viral pneumonia from November 1st, 2019 to December 31st, 2019 were included in our study. All patients were confirmed with RT-PCR. The clinical symptoms were similar in the three groups. Except fever and cough, diarrhea (6/80, 7.5%), tachypnea (2/80, 2.5%), and fatigue (6/80, 7.5%) were less common in COVID-19 patients. Compared to mycoplasma pneumonia and other viral pneumonia inpatients, COVID-19 patients present remarkably increased alanine aminotransferase (69/80, 86.3%). The typical CT feature of COVID-19 is ground-glass opacity, and it was more common in COVID-19 patients (32/80, 40%). Conclusion: The COVID-19 shared similar onsets with CAP. Even though the ground-glass opacity and elevated level of ALT were frequent in COVID-19, the better way for treatment and management of this disease is quickly and accurately identifying the pathogen.","Guo, Yu; Xia, Wei; Peng, Xuehua; Shao, Jianbo",Front Pediatr,,273

Most of the lesions were multiple, with an average of 12 ± 6 lung segments involved. The most common involved lung segments were the dorsal segment of the right lower lobe (69/80, 86%), the posterior basal segment of the right lower lobe (68/80, 85%), the lateral basal segment of the right lower lobe (64/80, 80%), the dorsal segment of the left lower lobe (61/80, 76%), and the posterior basal segment of the left lower lobe (65/80, 81%). The average pulmonary inflammation index value was (34% ± 20%) for all the patients. Correlation analysis showed that the pulmonary inflammation index value was significantly correlated with the values of lymphocyte count, monocyte count, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, days from illness onset, and body temperature (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The common chest CT findings of COVID-19 are multiple ground glass opacity, consolidation, and interlobular septal thickening in both lungs, which are mostly distributed under the pleura. There are significant correlations between the degree of pulmonary inflammation and the main clinical symptoms and laboratory results. Computed tomography plays an important role in the diagnosis and evaluation of this emerging global health emergency.","Wu, Jiong; Wu, Xiaojia; Zeng, Wenbing; Guo, Dajing; Fang, Zheng; Chen, Linli; Huang, Huizhe; Li, Chuanming",Invest Radiol,,273
516744,Telemedicine Medical Screening Evaluation Expedites the Initiation of Emergency Care for Children,2021,"BACKGROUND: Our purpose is to assess epidemiological agent-based models-or ABMs-of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic methodologically. The rapid spread of the outbreak requires fast-paced decision-making regarding mitigation measures. However, the evidence for the efficacy of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as imposed social distancing and school or workplace closures is scarce: few observational studies use quasi-experimental research designs, and conducting randomized controlled trials seems infeasible. Additionally, evidence from the previous coronavirus outbreaks of SARS and MERS lacks external validity, given the significant differences in contagiousness of those pathogens relative to SARS-CoV-2. To address the pressing policy questions that have emerged as a result of COVID-19, epidemiologists have produced numerous models that range from simple compartmental models to highly advanced agent-based models. These models have been criticized for involving simplifications and lacking empirical support for their assumptions. METHODS: To address these voices and methodologically appraise epidemiological ABMs, we consider AceMod (the model of the COVID-19 epidemic in Australia) as a case study of the modelling practice. RESULTS: Our example shows that, although epidemiological ABMs involve simplifications of various sorts, the key characteristics of social interactions and the spread of SARS-CoV-2 are represented sufficiently accurately. This is the case because these modellers treat empirical results as inputs for constructing modelling assumptions and rules that the agents follow; and they use calibration to assert the adequacy to benchmark variables. CONCLUSIONS: Given this, we claim that the best epidemiological ABMs are models of actual mechanisms and deliver both mechanistic and difference-making evidence. Consequently, they may also adequately describe the effects of possible interventions. Finally, we discuss the limitations of ABMs and put forward policy recommendations.","Maziarz, Mariusz; Zach, Martin",J Eval Clin Pract,,273

517898,Symbolic annihilation of Syrian refugees by Turkish news media during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Patients with diabetes are - compared to people without diabetes - at increased risk of worse outcomes from COVID-19 related pneumonia during hospitalization. We aim to investigate whether telemetric continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in quarantined hospitalized patients with diabetes and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or another contagious infection can be successfully implemented and is associated with better glycaemic control than usual blood glucose monitoring (finger prick method) and fewer patient-health care worker contacts. Furthermore, we will assess whether glucose variables are associated with the clinical outcome. The hypothesis is that by using remote CGM to monitor glucose levels of COVID-19 infected patients and patients with other contagious infections with diabetes, we can still provide satisfactory (and maybe even better) in-hospital diabetes management despite patients being quarantined. Furthermore, the number of patient-personnel contacts can be lowered compared to standard monitoring with finger-prick glucose. This could potentially reduce the risk of transmitting contagious diseases from the patient to other people and reduces the use of PPE's. Improved glucose control may reduce the increased risk of poor clinical outcomes associated with combined diabetes and infection. TRIAL DESIGN: This is a single centre, open label, exploratory, randomised, controlled, 2-arm parallel group (1:1 ratio), controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: The trial population is patients with diabetes (both type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, newly discovered diabetes that is not classified yet, and all other forms of diabetes) admitted to Nordsjællands Hospital that are quarantined due to COVID-19 infection or another infection. INCLUSION CRITERIA: 1. Hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 infection by real-time PCR or another validated method OR hospitalized with a non-COVID-19 diagnosis and quarantined at time of inclusion. 2. A documented clinically relevant history of diabetes or newly discovered during hospitalization as defined by The World Health Organizations diagnostic criteria for diabetes. 3. Written informed consent obtained before any trial related procedures are performed. 4. Male or female aged over 18 years of age. 5. Must be able to communicate with the study personnel. 6. The subject must be willing and able to comply with trial protocol. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: 1. Known hypersensitivity to the band-aid of the Dexcom G6 sensors INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Participants will be randomized to either real-time CGM with the Dexcom G6, a CGM system that does not need to be calibrated, or finger-prick glucose monitoring. Blinded CGM will be mounted in the finger-prick group. In the open CGM group, the glucose values will be transmitted to a Smartdevice in the nurse office where glucose levels can be monitored remotely. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary endpoint is the difference between groups in distribution of glucose values being in time in range (TIR), defined as 3.9 to 10 mmol/l. In addition, the primary endpoint is reported as the percentage of days of the whole admission, the patient reaches TIR. Secondary endpoints are the estimated number of saved patient-personnel contacts related to blood glucose measurements, incl. time healthcare providers spent on diabetes related tasks and PPE related tasks, during the patients' hospitalization. Furthermore, we will assess additional glucose outcomes and associations of glucose variables and patient outcomes (As specified in the protocol). RANDOMISATION: The service used for generating the randomization lists is www.random.org . Randomization is stratified by COVID-19 status and an allocation ratio of 1:1 to either CGM or finger-prick groups. BLINDING (MASKING): The design of the trial is open, however blinded CGM is recorded in the finger-prick group. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMIZED (SAMPLE SIZE): A sample size of N=72 is required for the primary endpoint analysis based on 80% power to detect a 10% difference between groups in TIR and to allow for a 15% dropout. The 72 participants will be randomized 1:1 to open CGM or finger-prick with 36 in each group. TRIAL STATUS: This structured protocol summary is based on the CGM-ISO protocol version 1.3, dated 13.05.2020. Date of first patient enrolled: 25.05.2020. Expected last recruiting is May 2021. Patients enrolled to date: 20 in total. 8 with confirmed COVID-19 infection and 12 with other infections. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04430608 .

519217,Key concerns in terms of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Flow-controlled ventilation (FCV) is a novel ventilation method increasingly being used clinically, particularly during the current COVID-19 pandemic. However, the continuous flow pattern in FCV during inspiration and expiration has a significant impact on respiratory parameters and ventilatory settings compared to conventional ventilation modes. In addition, the constant flow combined with direct intratracheal pressure measurement allows determination of dynamic compliance and ventilation settings can be adjusted accordingly, reflecting a personalized ventilation approach. CASE PRESENTATION: A 50-year old women with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection suffering from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was admitted to a tertiary medical center. Initial ventilation occurred with best standard of care pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) and was then switched to FCV, by adopting PCV ventilator settings. This led to an increase in oxygenation by 30 %. Subsequently, to reduce invasiveness of mechanical ventilation, FCV was individualized by dynamic compliance guided adjustment of both, positive end-expiratory pressure and peak pressure; this intervention reduced driving pressure from 18 to 12 cm H2O. However, after several hours, compliance further deteriorated which resulted in a tidal volume of only 4.7 ml/kg. CONCLUSIONS: An individualized FCV approach increased oxygenation parameters in a patient suffering from severe COVID-19 related ARDS. Direct intratracheal pressure measurements allow for determination of dynamic compliance and thus optimization of ventilator settings, thereby reducing applied and dissipated energy. However, although desirable, this personalized ventilation strategy may reach its limits when lung function is so severely impaired that patient's oxygenation has to be ensured at the expense of lung protective ventilation concepts.","Spraider, Patrick; Putzer, Gabriel; Breitkopf, Robert; Abram, Julia; Mathis, Simon; Glodny, Bernhard; Martini, Judith",BMC Anesthesiol,,273

The aim of the present study was to examine the risk factors for sarcopenia in elderly individuals with T2DM and the effects of metformin. Methods: A total of 1732 elderly with T2DM were recruited to this cross-sectional observational study, and we analyzed the data using logistic regression analyses. Skeletal muscle mass, grip strength, and usual gait speed were measured to diagnose sarcopenia according to the criteria of the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia, combined with expert consensus on sarcopenia in China. Results: The overall prevalence of sarcopenia was 10.37% of the participants. In the multivariate analysis, sex, age, educational level, and BMI were risk factors for sarcopenia, with women more likely to develop sarcopenia relative to men (OR = 2.539, 95% CI = 1.475-4.371; P < 0.05). We observed that sarcopenia increased with age and decreased with increasing BMI and educational level (P < 0.05). Participants who took metformin alone or combined with other drugs exhibited a lower risk for sarcopenia than those who took no medication (OR = 0.510, 95% CI = 0.288-0.904 and OR = 0.398, 95% CI = 0.225-0.702, respectively; P < 0.05). Conclusions: We showed that being female and at an older age, lower educational level, and lower BMI were risk factors for sarcopenia in elderly T2DM and that metformin acted as a protective agent against sarcopenia in these patients.","Chen, Fenqin; Xu, Shuai; Wang, Yingfang; Chen, Feng; Cao, Lu; Liu, Tingting; Huang, Ting; Wei, Qian; Ma, Guojing; Zhao, Yuhong; Wang, Difei",J Diabetes Res,,273

519429,Reopening safely - Lessons from Taiwan's COVID-19 response,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has spread rapidly throughout the world, causing thousands of illnesses and deaths. To fight this pandemic, almost all governments and health authorities have focused on prevention. In March or April, most countries' officials imposed home quarantine and lockdown measures nationwide. PURPOSE: This study sought to assess health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and anxiety levels among people in Portugal under mandatory home quarantine due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The results were compared to the general Portuguese population's HRQoL before the COVID-19 outbreak. This research also aimed to understand the factors that can influence the respondents' HRQoL. METHODS: A sample of Portugal's population quarantined at home (n = 904) filled in an online survey comprising the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item and the EQ-5D-5L and other questions about sociodemographic characteristics, feelings, duties and activities during the quarantine. The sample was weighted to mirror the general population's gender, age and education. Descriptive analyses and correlation coefficients were used to evaluation the respondents' anxiety and HRQoL. Generalised linear models were estimated to identify determinants of HRQoL during the COVID-19 quarantine. RESULTS: The results show that individuals quarantined at home reported higher anxiety and lower HRQoL levels and that people with more anxiety tended to have a lower HRQoL. Females and elderly individuals experienced the highest levels of anxiety and poorest HRQoL. In addition, HRQoL during the quarantine can be explained by various occupational and attitudinal variables, as well as sociodemographic variables. CONCLUSION: Individuals' mental health should be taken into consideration during pandemics or other emergency situations. Anxiety and other factors can decrease people's HRQoL, in conjunction with the pandemic's social and economic consequences.","Ferreira, Lara N; Pereira, Luís N; da Fé Brás, Maria; Ilchuk, Kateryna",Qual. life res,,273

Methods: Descriptive study of a nosocomial COVID-19 outbreak registered in March-April 2020 at medical ward of onco-hematological patients in an Spanish hospital. Confirmed cases were hospitalized patients, healthcare and non-healthcare workers who tested positive by PCR on a nasopharyngeal swab. Results: Twenty-two COVID-19 cases (12 workers and 10 inpatients) were laboratory-confirmed. Initial cases were a healthcare provider and a visitor who tested positive. The median patients age was 73 years (range 62-88). The main reason of admission was haematological in 8 patients and oncologic in 2. All patients followed an immunosuppressive treatment, 5/10 with high-flow oxygen nebulizations. Five patients presented a moderate/serious evolution, and 5 patients died. The mean workers age was 42.1±10.9. One healthworker required Intensive Care Unit admission, and all of them recovered completely. Conclusions: In the hospital setting, close patients surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 is essential, especially in immunosuppressed patients. Replacing nebulizations or high-flow oxygen therapies, when other equivalent options were available, to reduce dispersion, and controlling ventilation ducts, together with hygiene measures and an active follow-up on inpatients, visitors and workers appear to be important in preventing nosocomial outbreaks.","Bestilleiro, Rocío Seijo; Señaris, Diana Martinez; Rodríguez, María José Pereira; Vázquez, Rita Galeiras; Rodríguez, Raquel García; Rodriguez, María Teresa García; Martín, Cristina González; Pillado, María Teresa Seoane; Barreiro, Vanesa Balboa; Valiña, Valentín Valdés; Díaz, Sonia Pértega",Int J Med Sci,,273

Quality of life might become the most challenging long term complication. The JUBILE study describes the quality of life of people living with type 1 diabetes for more than 40 years. METHODS: Patients were recruited from thirty five French regional or university hospitals: patients and physicians completed questionnaires, validated by the Delphi method. From 1200 questionnaires circulated, 808 patients and their physicians returned questionnaires. RESULTS: The duration of type 1 diabetes was 49±6 years (mean±SD), age at diagnosis 15±10 years, HbA1c 7.4±0.9 % [58±10 mmol/mol] and 52% were men. Macrovascular disease was present in 32%, 46% had no or only mild non proliferative retinopathy. Insulin pumps were used by 25% and insulin pen/syringe users injected 3.9±2.1 times per day. Blood glucose was self-monitored at least 5 times per day by 67% of patients. Men had 1.8±1.2 children, women 1.4±1.0. More than half (55%) of this population was working, 38% had a university degree. Patients still had a busy life, going out (59%), eating out (82%), playing sports (38%) and travelling (66%). No differences appeared based on age, duration of diabetes, demography or social features. CONCLUSIONS: Living a long and pleasant life is possible with type 1 diabetes. Diabetes does not prevent people from having children, working at highly qualified jobs, travelling abroad: a message of hope that is comforting for patients, their family, relatives and the medical teams.","Altman, J-J; Niarra, R; Balkau, B; Vincent-Cassy, C",Diabet Med,,273

Alongside the excitement following the possibility of eradicating SARS-CoV-2 and ending the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been ample vaccine hesitancy, some due to the abundant reporting of adverse reactions. We report here that the occurrence of BNT162b2 vaccine adverse reactions is associated with enhanced antibody response. We found a statistically significant correlation between having an adverse reaction, whether local or systemic, and higher antibody levels. No sex difference was observed in antibody levels. However, as was recently reported, the antibody response was found to be lower among older vaccinees. The demonstration of a clear correlation between adverse reactions and antibody levels may help reduce vaccination hesitancy by reassuring that the presence of such reactions is an indication of a well-functioning immune system.","Rechavi, Yoav; Shashar, Moshe; Lellouche, Jonathan; Yana, Moshe; Yakubovich, Daniel; Sharon, Nechama",Vaccines (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9090977; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34579214/,273

FINDINGS: The mean level of burnout in the nurses at the COVID-19 hospitals was 57 out of 120, and burnout was affected by workload (β = 0.69, p < 0.001), job stress (β = 0.25, p < 0.001) and inadequate hospital resources for the prevention of COVID-19 (β = –0.16, p < 0.001). These three variables explained 87% of the variance in burnout. CONCLUSIONS: The burnout of nurses directly exposed to COVID-19 patients is more than nurses in other wards, and workload is the most significant cause of burnout in them. Therefore, necessary measures such as hiring more nurses, reducing working hours and increasing rest periods are necessary to reduce workload. In addition, the job stress of these nurses should be managed and controlled, and the hospital resources needed to prevent this disease should be provided.","Zare, Sajad; Kazemi, Reza; Izadi, Abolhassan; Smith, Andrew",Annals of global health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34221904/; https://doi.org/10.5334/aogh.3190,273
590336,Developing a Novel Interactive Colorectal Cancer Educational Session for First-Year Medical Students to Enhance Interest in Public Health,2021-09-22,"To date, COVID-19 case rates are disproportionately higher in Black and Latinx communities across the U.S., leading to more hospitalizations and deaths in those communities. These differences in case rates are evident in comparisons of Chicago neighborhoods with differing race/ethnicities of their residents. Disparities could be due to neighborhoods with more adverse health outcomes associated with poverty and other social determinants of health experiencing higher prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection or due to greater morbidity and mortality resulting from equivalent SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence. We surveyed five pairs of adjacent ZIP codes in Chicago with disparate COVID-19 case rates for highly specific and quantitative serological evidence of any prior infection by SARS-CoV-2 to compare with their disparate COVID-19 case rates. Dried blood spot samples were self-collected at home by internet-recruited participants in summer 2020, shortly after Chicago's first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Pairs of neighboring ZIP codes with very different COVID-19 case rates had similar seropositivity rates for anti-SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain IgG antibodies. Overall, these findings of comparable exposure to SARS-CoV-2 across neighborhoods with very disparate COVID-19 case rates are consistent with social determinants of health, and the co-morbidities related to them, driving differences in COVID-19 rates across neighborhoods.","Mustanski, B.; Saber, R.; Ryan, D.

Few days later, new cases are notified, followed by deaths. The government decided to adopt large-scale drastic measures against the epidemic. This study aims to describe and analyse the COVID-19 distribution in Morocco, according to key measures taken to curb this health problem. METHODS: An observational study of all cases daily reported by the Ministry of Health of Morocco from 02 March to 05 May 2020, was carried out. A mapping was performed. RESULTS: Before the implementation of the state of health emergency, 86 confirmed cases out of 471 biological examinations carried out have been reported and the highest cumulative incidence (0.43 cases per 100,000 inhabitants) was recorded in Fes-Meknes region. During the 1st quarantine, 2,960 positive cases out of 15,915 examinations carried out have been detected. Marrakech-Safi region was the most affected (15.33 cases per 100,000 inhabitants). Halfway through extended quarantine, 2,173 confirmed cases out of 49,570 biological examinations realized have been notified, the highest cumulative incidence has observed in Draa-Tafilalet region (27.45 cases per 100,000 inhabitants). The highest mortality was observed in Marrakech-Safi region (1.05 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants) and the highest case fatality rate (13.46%) was registered in Souss-Massa region. CONCLUSION: The strategy adopted by Morocco has enabled it to avoid a health catastrophe. But, it’s not over yet. Morocco should continue the massive efforts and reinforce the existing measures against the virus, especially in regions very affected by the epidemic.","Hadrya, Fatine; Soulaymani, Abdelmajid; El Hattimy, Faiçal",Pan Afr Med J,https://doi.org/10.11604/pamj.supp.2020.35.2.23505; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33623566/,273

594293,Sharing Solidarity Experiences to Overcome COVID-19,2020-09-03,"Backgrounds An ongoing outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia hit a major city of China, Wuhan, December 2019 and subsequently reached other provinces/regions of China and countries. We present estimates of the basic reproduction number, R0, of 2019-nCoV in the early phase of the outbreak. Methods Accounting for the impact of the variations in disease reporting rate, we modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases time series, in mainland China from January 10 to January 24, 2020, through the exponential growth. With the estimated intrinsic growth rate (γ), we estimated R0 by using the serial intervals (SI) of two other well-known coronavirus diseases, MERS and SARS, as approximations for the true unknown SI. Findings The early outbreak data largely follows the exponential growth. We estimated that the mean R0 ranges from 2.24 (95%CI: 1.96-2.55) to 3.58 (95%CI: 2.89-4.39) associated with 8-fold to 2-fold increase in the reporting rate. We demonstrated that changes in reporting rate substantially affect estimates of R0. Conclusion The mean estimate of R0 for the 2019-nCoV ranges from 2.24 to 3.58, and significantly larger than 1. Our findings indicate the potential of 2019-nCoV to cause outbreaks.","Zhao, Shi; Lin, Qianyin; Ran, Jinjun; Musa, Salihu S; Yang, Guangpu; Wang, Weiming; Lou, Yijun; Gao, Daozhou; Yang, Lin; He, Daihai; Wang, Maggie H",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.23.916395,273

While more studies are published to help us understand the virus, there is a dearth of studies on the clinical characteristics and associated outcomes of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on the African continent. Methods: We evaluated evidence from previous studies in Africa available in six databases between January 1 and October 6, 2020. Meta-analysis was then performed using Open-Meta Analyst software. Results: A total of seven studies including 4490 COVID-19 patients were included. The result of the meta-analysis showed 68.8% of infected patients were male. Common symptoms presented (with their incidences) were fever (42.8%), cough (33.3%), headache (11.3%), breathing problems (16.8%). Other minor occurring symptoms included diarrhea (7.5%), and rhinorrhea (9.4%). Fatality rate was 5.6%.

The approach led to the segregation of all segments of swine and human viruses into three distinct groups: two of them included the pandemic 1977 and 2009 human viruses, and the remaining group may be new in humans. These three groups might have originated from avian viruses and drifted out independently. Genome shifts occurred occasionally among swine viruses; however, distances between avian and swine/human viruses negated the existence of direct shifts from avian viruses. In humans, only one or two viruses appeared each year, which suggests the presence of competition among viruses that migrated freely. All segments drifted continuously under certain rules and constant velocity. Viruses that had caused an outbreak did not appear again over subsequent decades, which may mean populations had become immune to such viruses. In contrast, the viruses in livestock were rather conserved and maintained unique strains in small, separate areas. Such collections of swine strains included human segments, which could become an epidemic in the future.","Konishi, Tomokazu",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-55254-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31848356/,273

METHODS: A questionnaire was used to collect data from family doctors in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Beijing. We applied a structural equation analysis to analyze the causal relationship among the variables. RESULTS: We found out that psychological well-being and job involvement significantly influences the performance of family doctors in China. The study also noted that psychological capital moderates the relationship between psychological well-being attainment, job involvement, and performance. CONCLUSIONS: Studies have shown that these pressures affect their well-being considerably. For this reason, a healthcare professional who experiences positive emotions affects the total behavior which culminates into performance.","Xu, Xinglong; Zhou, Lulin; Asante-Antwi, Henry; Boafo-Arthur, Ama; Mustafa, Tehzeeb",BMC Fam Pract,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12875-020-01182-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32650723/,273

The world is experiencing a pandemic that has triggered significant challenges to healthcare systems in both high and low‐middle income countries (LMICs). Government policymakers and healthcare personnel are experiencing real‐life ethical dilemmas and are pressed to respond to these situations. Many possible treatments are being investigated, one of which is the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine. These drugs are approved for use by patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, and malaria. The demand for these products has increased, and the stocks are depleting for the patient population for whom the drugs are intended initially. Although both innovator and generic pharmaceutical manufacturers are making plans for increased production, there are challenges with global supply chains disruption and the retention of supplies for local markets. This may cause countries that rely on the importation of pharmaceuticals to be out of stock of supplies for an extended period. There are allegations of off‐label prescribing and hoarding. Pharmacists are the custodians and dispensers of medications and are faced with the task of assessing prescriptions and making decisions about the allocation of these products. This paper seeks to 1) highlight some of the ethical challenges of dispensing hydroxychloroquine by pharmacists during the COVID‐19 pandemic, 2) identify some of the responses to these issues from various regulatory authorities in the USA, and 3) recommend approaches to assist pharmacists in their decision‐making process, especially in LMICs.","Cox, Shereen",Dev World Bioeth,https://doi.org/10.1111/dewb.12284; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32844516/,273

In the context of presenting this study, we summarize the literature on data collection techniques, various marginalized and under researched populations, and the importance of gathering data about the victim-offender relationship and situational IPH risk factors. Additional research is needed to update risk factors for IPH to account for changes in technology and to examine differential risk across diverse populations. Local, community based data collection strategies are likely to provide more comprehensive and nuanced insight into IPH; though, to understand risk factors among marginalized populations, it may be necessary to increase sample size through a national strategy. Although not a panacea, we present this ongoing research as a model for other states to emulate and improve upon, in the hopes of developing more comprehensive data examining risk for IPH among victims of IPV.","Messing, Jill Theresa; AbiNader, Millan A.; Pizarro, Jesenia M.; Campbell, Jacquelyn C.; Brown, Megan Lindsay; Pelletier, Karissa R.",J Fam Violence,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10896-021-00254-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33654342/,273

Although effective against many infectious agents, the plant is not a miracle cure and there are infections where it has proved ineffective or limited. It is important to report those failures. METHODS: Here artemisinin, artesunate and dried leaf slurries of A. annua were used daily for 6 days in vivo against Babesia microti in mice 2 days post infection at 100 µg artemisinin/kg body weight. Parasitemia was measure before and 15 days days post treatment. Artemisinin and extracts of A. annua also were tested in vitro against six Candida sp. at artemisinin concentrations up to 180 µM and growth measured after cultures were fed drugs once at different stages of growth and also after repeated dosing. RESULTS: A. annua, artesunate, and artemisinin were ineffective in reducing or eliminating parasitemia in B. microti-infected mice treated at 100 µg artemisinin/kg body weight. Although the growth of exponential cultures of many of the tested Candida sp. was inhibited, the response was not sustained and both artemisinin and Artemisia were essentially ineffective at concentrations of artemisinin at up to 180 µM of artemisinin. CONCLUSIONS: Together these results show that artemisinin, its derivatives, and A. annua are ineffective against B. microti and at least six species of Candida.","Elfawal, Mostafa A.; Gray, Olivia; Dickson-Burke, Claire; Weathers, Pamela J.; Rich, Stephen M.",Longhua Chin Med,https://doi.org/10.21037/lcm-21-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34316676/,273

Methods PCR was used to detect HBoV1-DNA (HBoV1) and other viruses. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to explore possibility of co-detected for related viruses. Results The positivity rates in Nanjing and Lanzhou were 9.38% (74/789) and 11.62% (161/1386), respectively (P<0.05). The HBoV1 positive group was younger than negative group (P<0.05). Seasonal differences were noted, with a higher frequency of infection in December and July. HBoV1-positive children [72.34% (169/235)] were co-infected with other respiratory viruses. Multifactorial analysis showed no correlations between HBoV1 and the clinical classification, region, gender, age, or treatment as an outpatient or in a hospital. Correlations were identified between HBoV1 infections with ADV (OR=1.53, 95% CI 1.03-2.28), RSV (OR=0.71, 95% CI 0.52-0.98), and IFVA (OR=1.77, 95% CI 1.00-3.13). Conclusions Presence of HBoV1 in nasopharyngeal aspirates did not correlate with region or gender, although the prevalence of HBoV1 was higher in younger children.

In this study, we investigated the antitumor activity of a panel of EOs in different tumor models. The ability of Melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree oil) and its main component, terpinen-4-ol, to sensitize the target therapy currently used for melanoma treatment was also assessed. Our results demonstrated that EOs differently affect the viability of human cancer cells and led us to select six EOs effective in melanoma and lung cancer cells, without toxic effects in human fibroblasts. When combined with dabrafenib and/or trametinib, Melaleuca alternifolia synergistically reduced the viability of melanoma cells by activating apoptosis. Through machine learning classification modeling, α-terpineol, tepinolene, and terpinen-4-ol, three components of Melaleuca alternifolia, were identified as the most likely relevant components responsible for the EO’s antitumor effect. Among them, terpinen-4-ol was recognized as the Melaleuca alternifolia component responsible for its antitumor and proapoptotic activity. Overall, our study holds promise for further analysis of EOs as new anticancer agents and supports the rationale for their use to improve target therapy response in melanoma.","Di Martile, Marta; Garzoli, Stefania; Sabatino, Manuela; Valentini, Elisabetta; D’Aguanno, Simona; Ragno, Rino; Del Bufalo, Donatella",Cell Death Discov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34059622/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41420-021-00510-3,273

To better understand temporal evolution of COVID-19 related serological and other immune responses during a pandemic, we designed and implemented a baseline cross-sectional study of asymptomatic community volunteers and first responders in metro-Atlanta before the predicted infection peak in 2020. Methods: We recruited healthy community volunteers and first responders for health history, serology, and biobanking. Through an iterative process, we identified one location on our campus and one community location which were accessible, vacant, distant from COVID-19 testing sites, open for social distancing, private for informed consent, and operational for sanitation and ventilation. Research and cleaning supplies were obtained from other researchers and private online vendors due to shortages, and faculty directly participated in consenting and phlebotomy. Results: A total of 369 participants completed the study visits over six full and three half days.

The second part discusses the type of ethics that guided officials in their decisions. This type of ethics does not seem to me to be consistent with the ethical vision that would be appropriate in long-term care.

However, the implications of social media use on the everyday emotion (anxiety and depression) of users especially, international students, are not well understood. Thus, this study sought to examine the impact of social media use on the everyday emotion of international students in China during COVID-19. Using a structured online questionnaire based on modified questions from the generalized anxiety disorder 7 (GAD-7) and the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) and social media use instruments, data were collected from 480 participants. Of the total responses received, 474 were further analyzed employing the Partial Least Squares Path Modelling (PLS-PM). This study showed a significant positive relationship between social media use and everyday emotion (B = 0.34, 95% CI (0.26, 0.44)). Additionally, self-rated anxiety and depression associated with social media use among international students were generally mild (n = 249, 52.50% and n = 350, 73.80%, respectively). Moderating effects revealed that age and sex do not significantly moderate the relationship between social media use and everyday emotion in COVID-19. Given the nature of social media among international students, who are also prone to suffering from anxiety and depression associated with social media use, the positive effect of social media use and everyday emotion, especially in COVID-19, has important implications for international students’ education stakeholders. Thus, gaining a deeper understanding of this relationship could enable them to harness social media and use it as a valuable tool to overcome the social distancing constraints in COVID-19.","Larnyo, Ebenezer; Dai, Baozhen; Nutakor, Jonathan Aseye; Ampon-Wireko, Sabina; Appiah, Ruth; Larnyo, Abigail; Akey-Torku, Benedicta; Nkrumah, Edmund Nana Kwame",Healthcare (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34442148/; https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9081011,273

603340,Impact of SARS on healthcare utilization by disease categories: Implications for delivery of healthcare services,2007-04-18,"The COVID-19 pandemic has raised concern of viral spread within buildings. Although the near-field transmission and the infectious spread within individual rooms are well studied, the impact of aerosolized spread of SARS-CoV-2 via air handling systems within buildings remains unexplored. This study evaluates the concentrations and probabilities of infection for both building interior and exterior exposure sources using a well-mixed model in a multi-room building served by a central air handling system (without packaged terminal air conditioning). In particular, we compare the influence of filtration, air change rates, and the fraction of outdoor air. When the air supplied to the rooms comprises both outdoor air and recirculated air, we find filtration lowers the concentration and probability of infection the most in both source and connected rooms. We find that increasing the air change rate removes virus from the source room faster but also increases the rate of exposure in connected rooms. Therefore, slower air change rates reduce infectivity in connected rooms at shorter durations. We further find that increasing the fraction of virus-free outdoor air is helpful, unless outdoor air is infective in which case pathogen exposure inside persists for hours after a short-term release. Increasing the outdoor air to 33% or the filter to MERV-13 decreases the infectivity in the connected rooms by 19% or 93% respectively, relative to a MERV-8 filter with 9% outdoor air based on 100 quanta/h of 5 μm droplets, a breathing rate of 0.48 m(3)/h, and the building dimensions and air handling system considered.","Pease, Leonard F.; Wang, Na; Salsbury, Timothy I.; Underhill, Ronald M.; Flaherty, Julia E.; Vlachokostas, Alex; Kulkarni, Gourihar; James, Daniel P.",Build Environ,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132321000457?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33531734/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2021.107633; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360132321000457,273

Moreover, IFI44 is able to rescue poly(I·C)- and IFN-mediated inhibition of virus growth. Furthermore, we report a novel interaction of IFI44 with the cellular factor FK506-binding protein 5 (FKBP5), which binds to cellular kinases such as the inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B (IκB) kinases (IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKε). Importantly, in the presence of FKBP5, IFI44 decreases the ability of IKKβ to phosphorylate IκBα and the ability of IKKε to phosphorylate interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), providing a novel mechanism for the function of IFI44 in negatively modulating IFN responses. Remarkably, these new IFI44 functions may have implications for diseases associated with excessive immune signaling and for controlling virus infections mediated by IFN responses.","DeDiego, Marta L.; Nogales, Aitor; Martinez-Sobrido, Luis; Topham, David J.",mBio,https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.01839-19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31455651/,273

Understanding its transmission characteristics, including heterogeneity and the emergence of super spreading events (SSEs) where certain individuals infect large numbers of secondary cases, is of vital importance for prediction and intervention of future epidemics. Here, we collected information of all infected cases (135 cases) between 21 January and 26 February 2020 from official public sources in Tianjin, a metropolis of China, and grouped them into 43 transmission chains with the largest chain of 45 cases and the longest chain of four generations. Utilizing a heterogeneous transmission model based on branching process along with a negative binomial offspring distribution, we estimated the reproductive number R and the dispersion parameter k (lower value indicating higher heterogeneity) to be 0.67 (95% CI: 0.54–0.84) and 0.25 (95% CI: 0.13–0.88), respectively. A super-spreader causing six infections was identified in Tianjin. In addition, our simulation allowing for heterogeneity showed that the outbreak in Tianjin would have caused 165 infections and sustained for 7.56 generations on average if no control measures had been taken by local government since 28 January.

606799,Priority setting during the COVID-19 pandemic: going beyond vaccines,2021-01-18,"The large SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein is the main target of current COVID-19 vaccine candidates but can induce non-neutralizing antibodies, which may cause vaccination-induced complications or enhancement of COVID-19 disease. Besides, encoding of a functional S in replication-competent virus vector vaccines may result in the emergence of viruses with altered or expanded tropism. Here, we have developed a safe single round rhabdovirus replicon vaccine platform for enhanced presentation of the S receptor-binding domain (RBD). Structure-guided design was employed to build a chimeric minispike comprising the globular RBD linked to a transmembrane stem-anchor sequence derived from rabies virus (RABV) glycoprotein (G). Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and RABV replicons encoding the minispike not only allowed expression of the antigen at the cell surface but also incorporation into the envelope of secreted non-infectious particles, thus combining classic vector-driven antigen expression and particulate virus-like particle (VLP) presentation. A single dose of a prototype replicon vaccine, VSVΔG-minispike-eGFP (G), stimulated high titers of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in mice, equivalent to those found in COVID-19 patients. Boost immunization with the identical replicon further enhanced neutralizing activity. These results demonstrate that rhabdovirus minispike replicons represent effective and safe alternatives to vaccination approaches using replication-competent viruses and/or the entire S antigen.

608749,Dark personality traits and cyber aggression in adolescents: A moderated mediation analysis of belief in virtuous humanity and self-control,2020-10-13,"BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) often requires controlled ventilation, yielding high mechanical power and possibly further injury. Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) can be used as a bridge to recovery, however, if this fails the end result is destroyed lung parenchyma. This condition is fatal and the only remaining alternative is lung transplantation. In the case study presented in this paper, lung transplantation was not an option given the critically ill state and the presence of HLA antibodies. Airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) may be valuable in ARDS, but APRV settings recommended in various patient and clinical studies are inconsistent. The Time Controlled Adaptive Ventilation (TCAV™) method is the most studied technique to set and adjust the APRV mode and uses an extended continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) Phase in combination with a very brief Release Phase. In addition, the TCAV™ method settings are personalized and adaptive based on changes in lung pathophysiology. We used the TCAV™ method in a case of severe ARDS, which enabled us to open, stabilize and slowly heal the severely damaged lung parenchyma. CASE PRESENTATION: A 43-year-old woman presented with Staphylococcus Aureus necrotizing pneumonia. Progressive respiratory failure necessitated invasive mechanical ventilation and VV-ECMO. Mechanical ventilation (MV) was ultimately discontinued because lung protective settings resulted in trivial tidal volumes. She was referred to our academic transplant center for bilateral lung transplantation after the remaining infection had been cleared. We initiated the TCAV™ method in order to stabilize the lung parenchyma and to promote tissue recovery. This strategy was challenged by the presence of a large bronchopleural fistula, however, APRV enabled weaning from VV-ECMO and mechanical ventilation. After two months, following nearly complete surgical closure of the remaining bronchopleural fistulas, the patient was readmitted to ICU where she had early postoperative complications. Since other ventilation modes resulted in significant atelectasis and hypercapnia, APRV was restarted. The patient was then again weaned from MV. CONCLUSIONS: The TCAV™ method can be useful to wean challenging patients with severe ARDS and might contribute to lung recovery. In this particular case, a lung transplantation was circumvented.","Janssen, Malou; Meeder, J. Han.

Though international organisations created guidance in 2020 for vaccine deployment, this had to be adapted for each country's situation and values. We aimed to assist public health decision makers by identifying areas of consensus among Swiss experts for the deployment of one or more novel COVID-19 vaccines. METHODS An electronic, modified Delphi process between September and November 2020. We recruited a convenience sample of experts working in Switzerland from a variety of specialities, who completed two anonymous questionnaires. They voted on clarification questions and guidance statements from 0 (complete disagreement) to 10 (complete agreement). Responses for guidance statements with a median ≥8 and a lower inter-quartile range bound ≥7 were considered as reaching consensus. RESULTS Sixty-five experts accepted (66% response rate), with 47 completing the first questionnaire (72%), and 48 the second (74%). Statements reaching consensus included: in the first phase we should vaccinate front-line healthcare professionals and people ≥65 years with risk factors; widespread vaccination of children and adolescents should not be an early priority; and vaccines should be provided free of charge in the setting of national or cantonal vaccination campaigns. Statements not reaching consensus included: early vaccination of people living with someone with risk factors who are not themselves at risk; vaccination of people with previous confirmed or suspected COVID-19; and whether vaccination should be mandatory for individuals with certain activities, such as front-line healthcare professionals. CONCLUSIONS Experts reached consensus on several statements that were available for decision-makers when making key decisions for COVID-19 vaccine deployment in Switzerland. Statements without consensus highlighted areas requiring expert and public dialogue. The modified Delphi process allowed us to rapidly synthesise views from a broad panel of experts on sensitive topics, and could be considered for a broad range of issues during public health crises.","Selby, Kevin; Bornet, Marc-Antoine; Sancosme, Yann; von Elm, Erik; d'Acremont, Valérie; de Valliere, Serge; Cornuz, Jacques; Genton, Blaise",Swiss medical weekly,https://doi.org/10.4414/smw.2021.w30076; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34581549/,273

Healthcare has struggled to embrace systems safety approaches, mis-applied or misinterpreted others, and has stuck to a range of outdated and potentially counter-productive myths even has safety science has developed. One consequence of these persistent misunderstandings is that few opportunities exist in clinical settings for qualified HF professionals. Instead, HF has been applied by clinicians and others, to highly variable degrees – sometimes great success, but frequently in limited and sometimes counter-productive ways. Meanwhile, HF professionals have struggled to make a meaningful impact on frontline care and have had little career structure or support. However, In the last few years, embedded clinical HF practitioners have begun to have considerable success that are now being supported and amplified by professional networks.

Principles of a multisystem perspective on resilience and major findings on what matters for young people in disasters are delineated with reference to the pandemic. Striking parallels are noted in the psychosocial resilience factors identified at the level of individual children, families, schools, and communities. These parallels suggest that adaptive capacities associated with resilience in these interacting systems reflect interconnected networks and processes that co-evolved and may operate in concert.

METHODS: We surveyed a random sample of three groups of people: patients with epilepsy, people with psychiatric problems, and a group of the general population. The survey included four general questions (age, sex, education, and medical/psychiatric problem) and four COVID-19 specific questions (contracting COVID-19, relatives with COVID-19, wearing a face mask, and frequent hand washings). RESULTS: Three hundred and fifty -eight people were surveyed (108 healthy individuals, 154 patients with epilepsy, and 96 patients with psychiatric problems). Thirty-eight (11%) people had a history of COVID-19 contraction. The only factor that had a significant association with COVID-19 contraction was a relative with COVID-19 (Odds Ratio: 5.82; 95% Confidence Interval: 2.85–11.86; p = 0.0001). Having epilepsy did not increase the risk of COVID-19 contraction. CONCLUSION: Symptomatic COVID-19 does not seem to be more likely in PWE.

615773,Invited commentary: The Covid-19 pandemic in the United States,2021-01-04,"Turkey coronavirus (TCoV), one of the least characterized of all known coronaviruses, was isolated from an outbreak of acute enteritis in young turkeys in Ontario, Canada, and the full-length genomic sequence was determined. The full-length genome was 27,632 nucleotides plus the 3′ poly(A) tail. Two open reading frames, ORFs 1a and 1b, resided in the first two thirds of the genome, and nine additional downstream ORFs were identified. A gene for hemagglutinin-esterase was absent in TCoV. The region between the membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) protein genes contained three potential small ORFs: ORF-X, a previously uncharacterized ORF with an associated putative TRS within the M gene (apparently shared among all group III coronaviruses), and previously described ORFs 5a and 5b. The TCoV genome is organized as follows: 5′ UTR – replicase (ORFs 1a, 1b) – spike (S) protein – ORF3 (ORFs 3a, 3b) – small envelop (E or 3c) protein – membrane (M) protein – ORF5 (ORFs X, 5a, 5b) – nucleocapsid (N) protein −3′ UTR – poly(A). TCoV genome structure and sequence was most similar, but distinct from, avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). This is the first complete genome sequence for a TCoV and confirms that TCoV belongs to group III coronaviruses.","Gomaa, M.H.; Barta, J.R.; Ojkic, D.; Yoo, D.",Virus Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170208001317; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18468711/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170208001317; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2008.03.020,273
616688,Mental well-being during the first months of Covid-19 in adults and children: behavioral evidence and neural precursors,2021-09-02,"OBJECTIVES: Patients in ICUs often require neuroimaging to rule out a wide variety of intracranial problems. CT may be available in the ICU itself, but MRI has greater sensitivity for many conditions that affect the brain. However, transporting patients who are on ventilators and other life-sustaining devices is a labor-intensive process and involves placing the patient at risk for adverse events. This is a report of portable MRI in a clinical setting. DESIGN: This is a prospective, nonrandomized, observational study at one institution, utilizing a 0.064-T, self-shielding, portable MRI in ventilated patients in an ICU setting. SETTING: Academic medical center. PATIENTS: Nineteen patients with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. Patients selected for imaging had any of the following: 1) unexplained encephalopathy or coma, 2) seizures, 3) focal neurologic deficit, or 4) abnormal head CT. Imaging was performed in each patient’s ICU room with a portable, self-shielding, 0.064-T MRI. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Among 19 patients, 20 MRI scans in seven ICUs were acquired between April 13, 2020, and April 23, 2020. No adverse events to patients or staff from MRI acquisition were reported. In 12 patients, abnormal findings were seen, which included increased fluid attenuated inversion recovery signal (n = 12), hemorrhage (n = 3), and diffusion-weighted imaging positivity (n =3). Imaging led to changes in clinical management in five patients. CONCLUSIONS: In this case series of patients, use of portable MRI has been found to be safe, feasible, and led to changes in clinical management based on imaging results. However, future studies comparing results with other imaging modalities are required to understand fully the extent of its clinical utility.","Turpin, Justin; Unadkat, Prashin; Thomas, Justin; Kleiner, Nick; Khazanehdari, Shahab; Wanchoo, Sheshali; Samuel, Kenia; Moclair, Betsy O.; Black, Karen; Dehdashti, Amir R.; Narayan, Raj K.; Temes, Richard; Schulder, Michael",Crit Care Explor,https://doi.org/10.1097/cce.0000000000000306; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33381764/,273

618361,Scaled testing for COVID-19 needs community involvement,2021-03-01,"SARS-CoV-2 is a RNA Coronavirus responsible for the pandemic of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (COVID-19). It has affected the whole world including Odisha, a state in eastern India. Many people migrated in the state from different countries as well as states during this SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. As per the protocol laid by ICMR and Health & Family welfare of India, all the suspected cases were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of this study was to analyze the RNA binding domain (RBD) sequence of spike protein from the isolates collected from the throat swab samples of COVID-19 positive cases and further to assess the RBD affinity with ACE2 of different species including human. Whole genome sequencing for 35 clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolates from COVID-19 positive patients was performed using ARTIC amplicon based sequencing. Sequence analysis and phylogenetic analysis was carried out for the Spike and RBD region of all isolates. The interaction between the RBD and ACE2 receptor of five different species was also analysed. Except three isolates, spike region of 32 isolates showed one/multiple alterations in nucleotide bases in comparison to the Wuhan reference strain. One of the identified mutation at 1204 (Ref A, RMRC 22 C) in the RBD of spike protein was identified which depicted a stronger binding affinity with human ACE2 receptor compared to the wild type RBD. Furthermore, RBDs of all the Indian isolates are capable of binding to ACE2 of human, bat, hamster and pangolin. As mutated RBD showed stronger interaction with human ACE2, it could potentially result in higher infectivity. The study shows that RBDs of all the studied isolates have binding affinity for all the five species, which suggests that the virus can infect a wide variety of animals which could also act as natural reservoir for SARS-CoV-2.","Dash, Pujarini; Turuk, Jyotirmayee; Behera, Santosh Ku.; Palo, Subrata Ku.; Raghav, Sunil K.; Ghosh, Arup; Sabat, Jyotsnamayee; Rath, Sonalika; Subhadra, Subhra; Bhattacharya, Debadutta; Kanungo, Srikant; Kshatri, Jayasingh; Mishra, Bijaya kumar; Dash, Saroj; Mahapatra, Namita; Parida, Ajay; Pati, Sanghamitra",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.28.271601,273

The ivermectin is considered a drug of choice for various parasitic and viral diseases and shown to have in vitro effects against SARS-CoV-2. AIMS: Our study aimed to describe SARS-CoV2 infection and death rates in African countries that participated in an intensive Ivermectin mass campaign carried out to control onchocerciasis and compare them with those of countries that did not participate. METHODS: Data from 19 countries that participated in the World Health Organization (WHO) sponsored African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC), from 1995 until 2015, were compared with thirty-five (Non-APOC), countries that were not included. Information was obtained from https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ database. Generalized Poisson regression models were used to obtain estimates of the effect of APOC status on cumulative SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality rates. RESULTS: After controlling for different factors, including the Human Development Index (HDI), APOC countries (vs. non-APOC), show 28% lower mortality (0.72; 95% CI: 0.67-0.78) and 8% lower rate of infection (0.92; 95% CI: 0.91-0.93) due to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence in mortality rates and number of cases is significantly lower among the APOC countries compared to non-APOC countries. That a mass public health preventive campaign against COVID-19 may have taken place, inadvertently, in some African countries with massive community ivermectin use is an attractive hypothesis. Additional studies are needed to confirm it.","Guerrero, Rodrigo; Bravo, Luis Eduardo; Muñoz, Edgar; Ardila, Elvia Karina Grillo; Guerrero, Esteban",Colombia medica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33795896/; https://doi.org/10.25100/cm.v51i4.4613,273

It is unique in being the only evolutionary mechanism known to operate on a molecule in an organism’s own body. Deciphering the structural mechanisms through which somatic mutations in antibody genes increase affinity is critical to understanding the evolution of immune repertoires. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has allowed the reconstruction of antibody clonal lineages in response to viral pathogens, such as HIV-1, which was not possible in earlier studies of affinity maturation. Crystal structures of antibodies from these lineages bound to their target antigens have revealed, at the atomic level, how antibodies evolve to penetrate the glycan shield of envelope glycoproteins, and how viruses in turn evolve to escape neutralization. Collectively, structural studies of affinity maturation have shown that increased antibody affinity can arise from any one or any combination of multiple diverse mechanisms, including improved shape complementarity at the interface with antigen, increased buried surface area upon complex formation, additional interfacial polar or hydrophobic interactions, and preorganization or rigidification of the antigen-binding site.","Mishra, Arjun K.; Mariuzza, Roy A.",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2018.00117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29449843/,273

However, it suffers from limitations including the need of good image quality and of dedicated software with inter-vendor variability. We hypothesized that RV free wall longitudinal fractional shortening (LFS) could be used as a substitute to RVS, without suffering from the aforementioned limitations. Methods: We aimed to establish in a series of non-selected consecutive patients in sinus rhythm the value of LFS, calculated as [-(TAPSE/RVdiastolic length)] and of several common echocardiographic and Doppler parameters to predict an abnormal RV function, defined as RVS > − 20.2%. Results: Among 144 consecutive patients, poor image quality precluded the assessment of RVS and of LFS in 31 and 4 patients, respectively (P = 0.0018), resulting in a final study group of 113 patients. The intraclass correlation coefficients for inter- and intra-observer variability were 0.97 (95% CI 0.92; 0.98) and 0.93 (CI 0.92; 0.98) for LFS and RVS, respectively. Among all tested RV function indices, LFS best correlated with RVS (R 0.97, 95% CI 0.81; 0.91). Bland–Altman analysis for the comparison between LFS and RVS showed no systematic bias. The area under the ROC-curve of the various RV function indices to detect abnormal RVS was best for LFS (0.97, 95% CI 0.94–1), with sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive value of 83%, 96%, 96%, and 83%, respectively. Conclusion: LFS performs reasonably well to predict abnormal RVS and is more often feasible than RVS.","Unger, Philippe; Paesmans, Marianne; Vachiery, Jean-Luc; Rietz, Michael; Amzulescu, Mihaela; David-Cojocariu, Aurelia",Heart Vessels,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00380-021-01928-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34402942/,273
621425,"Age Differences in Stress, Life Changes, and Social Ties During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Implications for Psychological Well-Being",2020-12-21,"The ability to sense and adequately respond to variable environmental conditions is central for cellular and organismal homeostasis. Eukaryotic cells are equipped with highly conserved stress-response mechanisms that support cellular function when homeostasis is compromised, promoting survival. Two such mechanisms – the unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy – are involved in the cellular response to perturbations in the endoplasmic reticulum, in calcium homeostasis, in cellular energy or redox status. Each of them operates through conserved signaling pathways to promote cellular adaptations that include re-programming transcription of genes and translation of new proteins and degradation of cellular components. In addition to their specific functions, it is becoming increasingly clear that these pathways intersect in many ways in different contexts of cellular stress. Viral infections are a major cause of cellular stress as many cellular functions are coopted to support viral replication. Both UPR and autophagy are induced upon infection with many different viruses with varying outcomes – in some instances controlling infection while in others supporting viral replication and infection. The role of UPR and autophagy in response to coronavirus infection has been a matter of debate in the last decade. It has been suggested that CoV exploit components of autophagy machinery and UPR to generate double-membrane vesicles where it establishes its replicative niche and to control the balance between cell death and survival during infection. Even though the molecular mechanisms are not fully elucidated, it is clear that UPR and autophagy are intimately associated during CoV infections. The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has brought renewed interest to this topic as several drugs known to modulate autophagy – including chloroquine, niclosamide, valinomycin, and spermine – were proposed as therapeutic options. Their efficacy is still debatable, highlighting the need to better understand the molecular interactions between CoV, UPR and autophagy.","Prestes, Elisa B.; Bruno, Julia C.

Although the function of this viral protein is not fully elucidated, it is believed that it is crucial for the formation of the replication/transcription viral complex (RTC) and of the interaction of various viral “components” with the host cell; thus, it is essential for the entire viral life cycle. The first two SUDs, the so-called SUD-N (the N-terminal domain) and SUD-M (domain following SUD-N) domains, exhibit topological and conformational features that resemble the nsP3b macro (or “X”) domain. Indeed, they are all folded in a three-layer α/β/α sandwich structure, as revealed through crystallographic structural investigation of SARS-CoV SUDs, and they have been attributed to different substrate selectivity as they selectively bind to oligonucleotides. On the other hand, the C-terminal SUD (SUD-C) exhibit much lower sequence similarities compared to the SUD-N & SUD-M, as reported in previous crystallographic and NMR studies of SARS-CoV. In the absence of the 3D structures of SARS-CoV-2, we report herein the almost complete NMR backbone and side-chain resonance assignment ((1)H,(13)C,(15)N) of SARS-CoV-2 SUD-M and SUD-C proteins, and the NMR chemical shift-based prediction of their secondary structure elements.

The isolation of these antibodies, which are often rarely induced in human infections, has primarily been achieved by large-scale screening for suitable donors and new single B cell approaches to human monoclonal antibody generation. Engineering the antibodies to improve half-life and effector functions has further augmented their in vivo activity in some cases.

Within 24 h of hospital admission, a total of 922 patients aged ≥60 years were interviewed for symptoms of ongoing respiratory tract infection. Symptomatic patients were swabbed for oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal presence of viral pathogens immediately by members of the study group. During a 2-month period, non-symptomatic volunteers among interviewed patients were swabbed as well (controls). Oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal swabs were analyzed with real-time PCR for nine common respiratory viruses. A total of 147 out of 173 symptomatic patients and 56 non-symptomatic patients (controls) agreed to participate in the study. The patients were allocated to three cohorts: (1) symptomatic and PCR-positive (S/PCR+), (2) symptomatic and PCR-negative (S/PCR−), or (3) non-symptomatic and PCR-negative (control). There were no non-symptomatic patients with a positive PCR result. A non-significant difference in the frequency of empiric antibiotic administration was found when comparing the S/PCR+ to the S/PCR− cohort; 16/19 (84 %) vs. 99/128 (77 %) (χ(2) = 0.49). Antibiotic treatment was withdrawn in only two patients in the S/PCR+ cohort after receiving a positive viral diagnosis. The length of stay did not significantly differ between the S/PCR+ and the S/PCR− groups. We conclude that, at least in our general hospital setting, access to early viral diagnosis by real-time PCR had little impact on the antimicrobial treatment or length of hospitalization of elderly patients.

Current methods for pathogen detection and surveillance are usually dependent on prior knowledge of the etiologic agents involved. Hence, efficient approaches are required for screening wild mosquito populations to detect known and unknown pathogens. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we explored the use of Next Generation Sequencing to identify viral agents in wild-caught mosquitoes. We extracted total RNA from different mosquito species from South China. Small 18–30 bp length RNA molecules were purified, reverse-transcribed into cDNA and sequenced using Illumina GAIIx instrumentation. Bioinformatic analyses to identify putative viral agents were conducted and the results confirmed by PCR. We identified a non-enveloped single-stranded DNA densovirus in the wild-caught Culex pipiens molestus mosquitoes. The majority of the viral transcripts (.>80% of the region) were covered by the small viral RNAs, with a few peaks of very high coverage obtained. The +/− strand sequence ratio of the small RNAs was approximately 7∶1, indicating that the molecules were mainly derived from the viral RNA transcripts. The small viral RNAs overlapped, enabling contig assembly of the viral genome sequence. We identified some small RNAs in the reverse repeat regions of the viral 5′- and 3′ -untranslated regions where no transcripts were expected. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results demonstrate for the first time that high throughput sequencing of small RNA is feasible for identifying viral agents in wild-caught mosquitoes. Our results show that it is possible to detect DNA viruses by sequencing the small RNAs obtained from insects, although the underlying mechanism of small viral RNA biogenesis is unclear. Our data and those of other researchers show that high throughput small RNA sequencing can be used for pathogen surveillance in wild mosquito vectors.","Ma, Maijuan; Huang, Yong; Gong, Zhengda; Zhuang, Lu; Li, Cun; Yang, Hong; Tong, Yigang; Liu, Wei; Cao, Wuchun",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0024758; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21949749/,273

DESIGN: On-line cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Data were collected between 20(th) and 22(nd) April 2020. PARTICIPANTS: 6149 participants living in the UK aged 18 years or over. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Perceived immunity to COVID-19, self-reported adherence to social distancing measures (going out for essential shopping, nonessential shopping, and meeting up with friends/family; total out-of-home activity), worry about COVID-19 and perceived risk of COVID-19 to oneself and people in the UK. Knowledge that cough and high temperature / fever are the main symptoms of COVID-19. We used logistic regression analyses and one-way ANOVAs to investigate associations between believing you had had COVID-19 and binary and continuous outcomes respectively. RESULTS: In this sample, 1493 people (24.3%) thought they had had COVID-19 but only 245 (4.0%) reported having received a positive test result. Reported test results were often incongruent with participants’ belief that they had had COVID-19. People who believed that they had had COVID-19 were: more likely to agree that they had some immunity to COVID-19; less likely to report adhering to lockdown measures; less worried about COVID-19; and less likely to know that cough and high temperature / fever are two of the most common symptoms of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: At the time of data collection, the percentage of people in the UK who thought they had already had COVID-19 was about twice the estimated infection rate. Those who believed they had had COVID-19 were more likely to report leaving home. This may contribute to transmission of the virus. Clear communications to this growing group are needed to explain why protective measures continue to be important and to encourage sustained adherence.","Smith, Louise E.; Mottershaw, Abigail L.; Egan, Mark; Waller, Jo; Marteau, Theresa M.; Rubin, G.

625497,Psychological response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada: main stressors and assets,2021,"In this study of patients admitted with COVID-19, we examined differences between the two waves in patient characteristics and outcomes. Data were collected from the first COVID-19 admission to the end of study (01/03/2020–31/03/2021). Data were adjusted for age and sex and presented as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Among 12,471 admissions, 1452 (11.6%) patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. On admission, the mean (± SD) age of patients with other causes was 68.3 years (± 19.8) and those with COVID-19 in wave 1 was 69.4 years (± 18.0) and wave 2 was 66.2 years (± 18.4). Corresponding ages at discharge were 67.5 years (± 19.7), 63.9 years (± 18.0) and 62.4 years (± 18.0). The highest proportion of total admissions was among the oldest group (≥ 80 years) in wave 1 (35.0%). When compared with patients admitted with other causes, those admitted with COVID-19 in wave 1 and in wave 2 were more frequent in the 40–59 year band: 20.8, 24.6 and 30.0%; consisted of more male patients: 47.5, 57.6 and 58.8%; and a high LACE (Length of stay, Acuity of admission, Comorbidity and Emergency department visits) index (score ≥ 10): 39.4, 61.3 and 50.3%. Compared to wave-2 patients, those admitted in wave 1 had greater risk of death in hospital: OR = 1.58 (1.18–2.12) and within 30 days of discharge: OR = 2.91 (1.40–6.04). Survivors of COVID-19 in wave 1 stayed longer in hospital (median = 6.5 days; interquartile range = 2.9–12.0) as compared to survivors from wave 2 (4.5 days; interquartile range = 1.9–8.7). Patient characteristics differed significantly between the two waves of COVID-19 pandemic. There was an improvement in outcomes in wave 2, including shorter length of stay in hospital and reduction of mortality.

Variability in AKI may be explained by differences in traditional risk factors for AKI, heterogeneity among patient cohorts, and differences in racial and ethnic groups. Further, AKI requiring kidney replacement therapies (KRT) has been associated with increased mortality. Proposed mechanisms of kidney injury include direct viral-induced tubular or glomerular injury, sepsis-associated AKI, and thrombotic disease. Kidney pathology include acute tubular injury, glomerular fibrin thrombi, pigmented tubular casts, and collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. “Viral-like” particles have been observed in renal samples at electron microscopy and viral RNA has been identified in both glomerular and tubular compartments of kidney specimens, but the link between viral presence and injury remain unclear. Though the link between AKI and poor outcomes is clear, prevalence and outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with chronic kidney disease and end stage kidney disease has not yet been reported. In patients on immunosuppression like those with kidney transplants or glomerular disease, COVID-19 has presented a management dilemma.

Recent findings: The annual incidence of KD in Europe is about 10–15 per 100,000 children under 5 years old and seems to be relatively stable over time and space. Demographic characteristics are in line with those in other countries of the world, with a higher incidence in children from Asia and possibly North African origin. All studies performed across Europe found a coherent seasonal distribution of KD onset peaking from winter to early spring. This seasonal distribution was consistent over the years and suggests a climate-related environmental trigger. The occurrence of peaks during pandemics, microbiological findings and a possible link with southerly winds support the hypothesis of an airborne infectious agent. Neither other airborne agents such as pollutants or pollens nor urbanization and industrialization seem to have major effect on the etiology. Conclusion: Discrepancies in KD incidence rates across studies were due more to methodological differences, variation in definitions and awareness of the disease than a real increase in incidence. Genetic predisposition is undeniable in KD, but environmental factors seem to play a pivotal role. Several lines of evidence support a non-exclusive airborne infectious agent with a protective immune response by the host as a key factor in inducing the inflammatory cascade responsible for symptoms and complications.","Piram, Maryam",Front Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34113590/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2021.673554,273

We selected 25 census tracts per city, with probability proportional to the tract's size, ten households by census tract, and one random individual interviewed. A total of 8,265 older adults (≥60 years old) were interviewed and asked whether they had been vaccinated against flu in 2020. Vaccination coverage was 82.3% (95% CI: 80.1-84.2) with no difference by gender, age, and region; higher vaccination coverage was observed among the wealthiest (84.7% versus 80.1% in the poorest) and among the more educated (87.3% versus 83.2% less educated); lower coverage among indigenous (56.9% versus > 80% among other ethnic groups). A positive association was identified with the number of comorbidities among men but not among women. Most of the population was vaccinated (97.5%) in the public health system.

The inequitable impact of COVID-19 on people of color demonstrates the importance of applying expertise from nursing practice and public health systems to work with communities and other professions on complex health issues. Yet, despite a clear need for improved population health, educational programs designed to produce Advanced Public Health Nurses, with skills to address complex system changes, have become increasingly scarce. PURPOSE: We put forward the perspective that the nation needs more advanced practice nurses prepared for leadership roles focused on the health of whole populations, marginalized communities, and the systems and policies that promote their health. DISCUSSION: We argue that opportunities should be expanded for nurses to attain education for these roles through increased investments in the Doctor of Nursing Practice model to prepare nurses for advanced public health specialty practice.","Bekemeier, Betty; Kuehnert, Paul; Zahner, Susan J.; Johnson, Kathleen H.; Kaneshiro, Jasmine; Swider, Susan M.",Nurs Outlook,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.outlook.2021.03.023; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002965542100097X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33958201/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S002965542100097X,273

Yet the molecular events that underlie cellular recognition and response to SARS-CoV-2 infection remain to be elucidated. Here, we find that SARS-CoV-2 replication induces a delayed interferon (IFN) response in lung epithelial cells. By screening 16 putative sensors involved in sensing of RNA virus infection, we found that MDA5 and LGP2 primarily regulate IFN induction in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further analyses revealed that viral intermediates specifically activate the IFN response through MDA5-mediated sensing. Additionally, we find that IRF3, IRF5, and NF-κB/p65 are the key transcription factors regulating the IFN response during SARS-CoV-2 infection. In summary, these findings provide critical insights into the molecular basis of the innate immune recognition and signaling response to SARS-CoV-2.","Yin, Xin; Riva, Laura; Pu, Yuan; Martin-Sancho, Laura; Kanamune, Jun; Yamamoto, Yuki; Sakai, Kouji; Gotoh, Shimpei; Miorin, Lisa; De Jesus, Paul D.; Yang, Chih-Cheng; Herbert, Kristina M.; Yoh, Sunnie; Hultquist, Judd F.; García-Sastre, Adolfo; Chanda, Sumit K.",Cell Rep,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S221112472031617X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33440148/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.108628; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221112472031617X,273
630429,Vaccination anxiety when vaccinations are available: The role of existential concerns,2021-07-13,"The electron density of a nanoparticle is a very important characteristic of the properties of a material. This paper describes the formation of silver nanoparticles (NPs) and the variation in the electronic state of an NP’s surface upon the reduction in Ag(+) ions with oxalate ions, induced by UV irradiation. The calculations were based on optical spectrophotometry data. The NPs were characterized using Transmission electron microscopy and Dynamic light scattering. As ~10 nm nanoparticles are formed, the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) band increases in intensity, decreases in width, and shifts to the UV region from 402 to 383 nm. The interband transitions (IBT) band (≤250 nm) increases in intensity, with the band shape and position remaining unchanged. The change in the shape and position of the LSPR band of silver nanoparticles in the course of their formation is attributable to an increasing concentration of free electrons in the particles as a result of a reduction in Ag(+) ions on the surface and electron injection by [Formula: see text] radicals. The ζ-potential of colloids increases with an increase in electron density in silver nuclei. A quantitative relationship between this shift and electron density on the surface was derived on the basis of the Mie–Drude theory. The observed blue shift (19 nm) corresponds to an approximately 10% increase in the concentration of electrons in silver nanoparticles.","Ershov, Vadim; Tarasova, Natalia; Ershov, Boris",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms221910673; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34639013/,273
631368,A geographic analysis of population density thresholds in the influenza pandemic of 1918–19,2013-02-20,"PURPOSE: Breast radiation therapy accounts for a significant proportion of patient volume in contemporary radiation oncology practice. In the setting of anticipated resource constraints and widespread community infection with SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic, measures for balancing both infectious and oncologic risk among patients and providers must be carefully considered. Here, we present evidence-based guidelines for omitting or abbreviating breast cancer radiation therapy, where appropriate, in an effort to mitigate risk to patients and optimize resource utilization. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Multidisciplinary breast cancer experts at a high-volume comprehensive cancer center convened contingency planning meetings over the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic to review the relevant literature and establish recommendations for the application of hypofractionated and abbreviated breast radiation regimens. RESULTS: Substantial evidence exists to support omitting radiation among certain favorable risk subgroups of patients with breast cancer and for abbreviating or accelerating regimens among others. For those who require either whole-breast or postmastectomy radiation, with or without coverage of the regional lymph nodes, a growing body of literature supports various hypofractionated approaches that appear safe and effective. CONCLUSIONS: In the setting of a public health emergency with the potential to strain critical healthcare resources and place patients at risk of infection, the parsimonious application of breast radiation therapy may alleviate a significant clinical burden without compromising long-term oncologic outcomes. The judicious and personalized use of immature study data may be warranted in the setting of a competing mortality risk from this widespread pandemic.","Braunstein, Lior Z.; Gillespie, Erin F.; Hong, Linda; Xu, Amy; Bakhoum, Samuel F.; Cuaron, John; Mueller, Boris; McCormick, Beryl; Cahlon, Oren; Powell, Simon; Khan, Atif J.",Adv Radiat Oncol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2452109420300658; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452109420300658?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32292842/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adro.2020.03.013,273

We aimed to examine this association, including interactions with demographic and behavioural characteristics, type 2 diabetes, and other health conditions. METHODS: In this prospective, community-based, cohort study, we used de-identified patient-level data from the QResearch database of general practices in England, UK. We extracted data for patients aged 20 years and older who were registered at a practice eligible for inclusion in the QResearch database between Jan 24, 2020 (date of the first recorded infection in the UK) and April 30, 2020, and with available data on BMI. Data extracted included demographic, clinical, clinical values linked with Public Health England's database of positive SARS-CoV-2 test results, and death certificates from the Office of National Statistics. Outcomes, as a proxy measure of severe COVID-19, were admission to hospital, admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), and death due to COVID-19. We used Cox proportional hazard models to estimate the risk of severe COVID-19, sequentially adjusting for demographic characteristics, behavioural factors, and comorbidities. FINDINGS: Among 6 910 695 eligible individuals (mean BMI 26·78 kg/m(2) [SD 5·59]), 13 503 (0·20%) were admitted to hospital, 1601 (0·02%) to an ICU, and 5479 (0·08%) died after a positive test for SARS-CoV-2. We found J-shaped associations between BMI and admission to hospital due to COVID-19 (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] per kg/m(2) from the nadir at BMI of 23 kg/m(2) of 1·05 [95% CI 1·05–1·05]) and death (1·04 [1·04–1·05]), and a linear association across the whole BMI range with ICU admission (1·10 [1·09–1·10]). We found a significant interaction between BMI and age and ethnicity, with higher HR per kg/m(2) above BMI 23 kg/m(2) for younger people (adjusted HR per kg/m(2) above BMI 23 kg/m(2) for hospital admission 1·09 [95% CI 1·08–1·10] in 20–39 years age group vs 80–100 years group 1·01 [1·00–1·02]) and Black people than White people (1·07 [1·06–1·08] vs 1·04 [1·04–1·05]). The risk of admission to hospital and ICU due to COVID-19 associated with unit increase in BMI was slightly lower in people with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease than in those without these morbidities. INTERPRETATION: At a BMI of more than 23 kg/m(2), we found a linear increase in risk of severe COVID-19 leading to admission to hospital and death, and a linear increase in admission to an ICU across the whole BMI range, which is not attributable to excess risks of related diseases. The relative risk due to increasing BMI is particularly notable people younger than 40 years and of Black ethnicity.

Generally the number of deaths per million population are higher in the developed countries despite better health care efficiency, drinking water quality and expected healthy life span (HALE) at the time of birth. Developing and underdeveloped countries on the other hand have lower mortality even with higher rural and slum populations along with incidence of diarrhea because of lack of sanitation. We analyzed data from 122 countries out of which 80 were high or upper middle income and 42 were low or low middle income countries. There was statistically significant positive correlation between COVID 19 deaths /million population and water current score, health efficiency, and HALE. Statistically significant negative correlation was observed with % rural population and fraction of diarrhea because of inadequate sanitation for all ages. Moreover analysis of 51 countries showed that there is significant negative correlation between COVID 19 deaths /million population and proportion of total population living in slums. We propose that high microbial exposure particularly gram negative bacteria can possibly induce interferon type I which might have a protective effect against COVID 19 since the countries with less mortality also tend to have lack of sanitation and high incidence of attendant diseases. So, far none of the predictive models have taken into account immune status of populations engendered by environmental microbial exposure or microbiome.

634792,Distance learning in Italian primary and middle school children during the COVID-19 pandemic: a national survey,2021-06-02,"PURPOSE: Host genetic variants may contribute to severity of COVID-19. NKG2C(+) NK cells are potent antiviral effector cells, potentially limiting the extent of SARS-CoV-2 infections. NKG2C is an activating NK cell receptor encoded by the KLRC2 gene, which binds to HLA-E on infected cells leading to NK cell activation. Heterozygous or homozygous KLRC2 deletion (KLRC2(del)) may naturally occur and is associated with a significantly lower or absent NKG2C expression level. In addition, HLA-E*0101/0103 genetic variants occur, caused by a single-nucleotide polymorphism. We therefore investigated whether the severity of COVID-19 is associated with these genetic variants. METHODS: We investigated the distribution of KLRC2 deletion and HLA-E*0101/0103 allelic variants in a study cohort of 361 patients with either mild (N = 92) or severe (N = 269) COVID-19. RESULTS: Especially the KLRC2(del), and at a lower degree the HLA-E*0101, allele were significantly overrepresented in hospitalized patients (p = 0.0006 and p = 0.01), particularly in patients requiring intensive care (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.01), compared with patients with mild symptoms. Both genetic variants were independent risk factors for severe COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Our data show that these genetic variants in the NKG2C/HLA-E axis have a significant impact on the development of severe SARS-CoV-2 infections, and may help to identify patients at high-risk for severe COVID-19.","Vietzen, Hannes; Zoufaly, Alexander; Traugott, Marianna; Aberle, Judith; Aberle, Stephan W.; Puchhammer-Stöckl, Elisabeth",Genet Med,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41436-020-01077-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33500568/,273
634858,Introducing the First Special Issue on COVID-19 and Older Adults,2021,"The T cell immunoglobulin mucin (TIM) receptors are involved in the regulation of immune responses, autoimmunity, and allergy. Structures of the N-terminal ligand binding domain of the murine mTIM-1 and mTIM-2 receptors revealed an immunoglobulin (Ig) fold, with four Cys residues bridging a distinctive CC′ loop to the GFC β-sheet. The structures showed two ligand-recognition modes in the TIM family. The mTIM-1 structure identified a homophilic TIM-TIM adhesion interaction, whereas the mTIM-2 domain formed a dimer that prevented homophilic binding. Biochemical, mutational, and cell adhesion analyses confirmed the divergent ligand-binding modes revealed by the structures. Structural features characteristic of mTIM-1 appear conserved in human TIM-1, which also mediated homophilic interactions. The extracellular mucin domain enhanced binding through the Ig domain, modulating TIM receptor functions. These results explain the divergent immune functions described for the murine receptors and the role of TIM-1 as a cell adhesion receptor in renal regeneration and cancer.","Santiago, César; Ballesteros, Angela; Tami, Cecilia; Martínez-Muñoz, Laura; Kaplan, Gerardo G.; Casasnovas, José M.",Immunity,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1074761307001756; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074761307001756; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17363299/,273

During this time, the management of people with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and COVID-19 has become a global issue, especially since preexisting cardiovascular disease is a risk factor for the presence and the severity of COVID-19. The number of people with ST- elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) has decreased during the pandemic and delays in the time looking for medical care have been reported. In addition, the diagnosis of ACS may have been difficult due to possible underlying myocarditis or other clinical entities. Regarding management of people with STEMI, although the superiority of primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) over thrombolysis is well established, the notable exposure risks due to absence of negative pressure in catheterization rooms and the increased difficulty in fine manipulation on guidewires under proper protection equipment may contribute to the relatively secondary role of PCI during the COVID-19 pandemic; thus, fibrinolytic therapy or robotic-assisted PCI in early presenting STEMI patients may have an alternative role during this period if prevention measures cannot be taken.

TMPRSS2 is an emerging molecular target that plays a role in the early stages of SARS-COV-2 infection; hence, inhibiting its activity might be a target for COVID-19. This study aims to use many computational approaches to provide compounds that could be optimized into clinical candidates. As there is no experimentally derived protein information, initially we develop TMPRSS2 model. Then, we generate a pharmacophore model from TMPRSS2 active site consequently, and the developed models were employed for the screening of one million molecules from Enamine database. The created model was then screened using e-pharmacophore-based screening, molecular docking, free energy estimation and molecular dynamic simulation. Also, ADMET prediction and density functional theory calculations were performed. Three potential molecules (Z126202570, Z46489368, and Z422255982) exhibited promising stable binding interactions with the target. In conclusion, these findings empower further in vitro and clinical assessment for these compounds as novel anti-COVID19 agents.","Alzain, Abdulrahim A.; Albadwi, Fatima E.",Inform Med Unlocked,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352914821002331; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352914821002331?v=s5,273

The purpose of this study was to analyze the effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the use of emergency medical facilities in the Republic of Korea. This single-center, retrospective observational study was conducted in a tertiary teaching hospital located in Incheon Metropolitan City, Republic of Korea. We set the pandemic period as February 19, 2020 to April 18, 2020, and the control period was set to the same period in 2018 and 2019. All consecutive patients who visited the emergency department (ED) during the study period were included. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to age (pediatric patients, younger adult patients and older adult patients). The total number, demographics, clinical data, and diagnostic codes of ED patients were analyzed. The total number of ED patients in the pandemic period was lower than that in the control period, which was particularly pronounced for pediatric patients. The proportion of patients who used the 119 ambulances increased in all 3 groups (P = .002, P < .001, and P = .001), whereas the proportion of patients who visited on foot was decreased (P = .006, P < .001, and P = .027). In terms of diagnostic codes, a significant decrease was observed in the proportion of certain infectious or parasitic diseases (A00-B99), and respiratory diseases (J00-J99) in the pediatric and younger adult patient groups (P < .001 and P < .001, respectively). The COVID-19 pandemic reduced the number of ED patients; however, the proportion of patients using ambulances increased.

It is necessary to identify indicators that can be used as optimal predictors for clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: The clinical information from 126 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were collected from Wuhan Fourth Hospital. Specific clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, treatments and clinical outcomes were analyzed from patients hospitalized for treatment from 1 February to 15 March 2020, and subsequently died or were discharged. A random forest (RF) algorithm was used to predict the prognoses of COVID-19 patients and identify the optimal diagnostic predictors for patients’ clinical prognoses. RESULTS: Seven of the 126 patients were excluded for losing endpoints, 103 of the remaining 119 patients were discharged (alive) and 16 died in the hospital. A synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) was used to correct the imbalanced distribution of clinical patients. Recursive feature elimination (RFE) was used to select the optimal subset for analysis. Eleven clinical parameters, Myo, CD8, age, LDH, LMR, CD45, Th/Ts, dyspnea, NLR, D-Dimer and CK were chosen with AUC approximately 0.9905. The RF algorithm was built to predict the prognoses of COVID-19 patients based on the best subset, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the test data was 100%. Moreover, two optimal clinical risk predictors, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and Myoglobin (Myo), were selected based on the Gini index. The univariable logistic analysis revealed a substantial increase in the risk for in-hospital mortality when Myo was higher than 80 ng/ml (OR = 7.54, 95% CI [3.42–16.63]) and LDH was higher than 500 U/L (OR = 4.90, 95% CI [2.13–11.25]). CONCLUSION: We applied an RF algorithm to predict the mortality of COVID-19 patients with high accuracy and identified LDH higher than 500 U/L and Myo higher than 80 ng/ml to be potential risk factors for the prognoses of COVID-19 patients in the early stage of the disease.","Wang, Jie; Yu, Heping; Hua, Qingquan; Jing, Shuili; Liu, Zhifen; Peng, Xiang; Cao, Cheng’an; Luo, Yongwen",PeerJ,https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.9945; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32974109/,273

We describe the case of an Italian 7-week-old suckling baby SARS-CoV-2-positive only by cell culture method with no clinical suspicion and/or risk factors of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The patient was referred to the hospital with signs and symptoms of infection of the upper respiratory tract before the virus was spread to the province. Nasal and pharyngeal swabs and a nasopharyngeal aspirate were used for conventional and molecular diagnostic assays not including SARS-CoV-2 virus. Bacteria referred to resident population were revealed in nasal and pharyngeal swabs. No viruses were detected using both immunofluorescence assay and nucleic acid amplification assays in the nasopharyngeal aspirate. The baby was discharged in good conditions after 3 days of hospitalization. Later a cytopathic effect on the cell monolayers currently used for respiratory viruses was observed and the viral particles were identified as Coronaviridae by transmission electron microscopy. SARS-CoV-2 was identified by RT-PCR performed both on cell culture and on the stored aliquot of the original sample. The virus isolate was named SARS-Cov-2/human/Parma/1/2020.Cell culture still remains the only reference diagnostic method also for emerging viruses, allowing to reveal cytopathogenic viruses and demonstrating their infectivity.","Calderaro, Adriana; Arcangeletti, Maria Cristina; De Conto, Flora; Buttrini, Mirko; Montagna, Paolo; Montecchini, Sara; Ferraglia, Francesca; Pinardi, Federica; Chezzi, Carlo",Int J Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.05.035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32417248/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220303428?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220303428,273

The chest radiograph showed a large right-sided pneumothorax. The first attempt at drainage, performed through a large bored tube, failed. Due to the large dimension of the pneumothorax, and the lung condition (extensive consolidation and diffuse bullous dystrophies), the only thoracic surgical approach prospected was a pneumonectomy. Willing to preserve the lung, the pulmonology team attempted a multi-phase medical-oriented strategy based on medical thoracoscopy. Therefore, the patient underwent 5 chest tube insertions, 2 talc pleurodesis, and an intrapleural blood patch. Air leakage resolution was progressively achieved, and the patient became asymptomatic.

An analysis of 480 BALF samples was performed in patients with hematological malignancies over a period of 7 years. The results of culture methods, PCR, and immunoenzymatic sandwich microplate assays for Aspergillus galactomannan (GM) in BALF were analyzed. Further, the diagnostic thresholds for Aspergillus GM and Pneumocystis jiroveci were also calculated. Microbiological findings were present in 87% of BALF samples. Possible infectious pathogens were detected in 55% of cases; 32% were classified as colonizing. No significant difference in diagnostic yield or pathogen spectrum was found between non-neutropenic and neutropenic patients. There was one significant difference in BALF findings among intensive care units (ICU) versus non-ICU patients for Aspergillus spp. (22% versus 9%, p = 0.03). The most common pathogens were Aspergillus spp. (n = 86, 33% of BAL with causative pathogens) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 46, 18%); polymicrobial etiology was documented in 20% of cases. A quantitative PCR value of > 1860 cp/mL for Pneumocystis jirovecii was set as a diagnostic threshold for pneumocystis pneumonia. The absorbance index of GM in BALF of 0.5 was set as a diagnostic threshold for aspergillosis. The examination of BAL fluid revealed the presence of pathogen in more than 50% of cases and is, therefore, highly useful in this regard when concerning pulmonary infiltrates.

Entry inhibitors act by targeting viral and/or cellular components, through either the inhibition of protein-protein interactions within the viral envelope proteins or between viral proteins and host cell receptors, or through the inhibition of protein-lipid interactions. Interestingly, inhibitors that concentrate into/onto the membrane in order to target a protein involved in the entry process, such as arbidol or peptide inhibitors of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), could allow the use of doses compatible with therapeutic requirements. The efficacy of these drugs validates entry as a point of intervention in viral life cycles. Strategies based upon small molecule antiviral agents, peptides, proteins or nucleic acids, would most likely prove efficient in multidrug combinations, in order to inhibit several steps of virus life cycle and prevent disease progression.","Teissier, Elodie; Penin, François; Pécheur, Eve-Isabelle",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21193846/; https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules16010221,273

The survey also included online interviews with eminent materials scientists who shared their local experiences during this period. The interviews were compiled as a series of audio conversations for The STAM Podcast that is freely available worldwide. Our findings included that the majority of institutes were not prepared for such a crisis; researchers in China, Japan, and Singapore were able to resume research much quicker – for example after approximately one month in Japan – than their counterparts in the US and Europe after the first lockdowns; researchers adapted to using virtual teleconferencing to maintain contact with colleagues; and doctoral students were the hardest hit by the pandemic with deep concerns about completing their research and career prospects.

Although thrombocytopenia is not an initial presentation as an infectious coagulopathy, recent studies have demonstrated the vital role of platelets in COVID-19-associated coagulopathy SARS-CoV-2 and its spike protein have been known to directly or indirectly promote release of prothrombotic and inflammatory mediators that lead to COVID-19-associated coagulopathy. Although clinical features of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia include uncommon locations of thrombosis, including cerebral venous sinus, we speculate coronavirus spike-protein-initiated prothrombotic pathways are involved in the pathogenesis of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia, as current evidence suggests that the spike protein is the promotor and other cofactors such as perturbed immune response and inflammatory reaction enhance the production of anti-platelet factor 4 antibody.","Iba, Toshiaki; Levy, Jerrold H.",Trends Cardiovasc Med,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1050173821000967; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34455073/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tcm.2021.08.012; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1050173821000967?v=s5,273

The viral spike protein S has been reported to enhance thrombosis formation, stimulate platelets to release pro-coagulant factors and promote the formation of platelet-leukocyte aggregates even in absence of the virus. Although SARS-CoV-2 vaccines induce spike protein overexpression to trigger SARS-CoV-2-specific immune protection, thrombocyte activity has not been investigated in this context. Here, we provide the first phenotypic platelet characterization of healthy human subjects undergoing BNT162b2 vaccination. Using mass cytometry, we analyzed the expression of constitutive transmembrane receptors, adhesion proteins and platelet activation markers in 12 healthy donors before and at five different timepoints within four weeks after the first BNT162b2 administration. We measured platelet reactivity by stimulating thrombocyte activation with thrombin receptor-activating peptide (TRAP). Activation marker expression (P-Selectin, LAMP-3, LAMP-1, CD40L and PAC-1) did not change after vaccination. All investigated constitutive transmembrane proteins showed similar expressions over time. Platelet reactivity was not altered after BNT162b2 administration.

OBJECTIVE: To address these challenges as well as their preferences for sexual and gender minority–targeted interventions and digital programs, we developed and evaluated the acceptability, preliminary efficacy, and impact on theory-based change processes of an acceptance and commitment therapy–based digital program called Empowered, Queer, Quitting, and Living (EQQUAL). METHODS: Participants (n=22) of a single-arm trial conducted to evaluate the program were young adults, age 18 to 30 years, who self-identified as sexual and gender minority individuals and smoked at least one cigarette per day. All participants received access to the EQQUAL program. Participants completed web-based surveys at baseline and at a follow-up 2 months after enrollment. We verified self-reported smoking abstinence with biochemical testing; missing data were counted as smoking or using tobacco. RESULTS: For young adults who logged in at least once (n=18), the mean number of log-ins was 5.5 (SD 3.6), mean number of sessions completed was 3.1 (SD 2.6), and 39% (7/18) completed all 6 sessions. Overall, 93% of participants (14/15) were satisfied with the EQQUAL program, 100% (15/15) found it easy to use, and 100% (15/15) said it helped them be clearer about how to quit. Abstinence from smoking or using tobacco was confirmed with biochemical testing for 23% of participants (5/22). Both quantitative and qualitative results suggested a positive overall response to the avatar guide, with areas for future improvement largely centered on the avatar’s appearance and movements. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment acceptability of EQQUAL was very promising. The rate of abstinence, which was biochemically confirmed, was 3 times higher than that of the only other digital program to date that has targeted sexual and gender minority young adults and 6 to 13 times higher than those of nontargeted digital smoking interventions among sexual and gender minority young adults. Planned improvements for the next iteration of the program include making the avatar’s movements more natural; offering multiple avatar guides with different on characteristics such as race, ethnicity, and gender identity from which to choose; and providing a support forum for users to connect anonymously with peers.","Heffner, Jaimee L; Watson, Noreen L; Serfozo, Edit; Kelly, Megan M; Reilly, Erin D; Kim, Daniella; Baker, Kelsey; Scout, N F N; Karekla, Maria",JMIR Form Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/30241; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34328430/,273

This pandemic portrays a spectrum of clinical complications, primarily affecting the respiratory system reported to be caused by a pathogen SARS-CoV-2 belonging to the family of beta coronavirus. Currently, the main objective of the government authorities of all affected countries and research organizations is to find a potential solution in the form of a pharmacological intervention or a vaccination to eradicate the disease and to have a long-term solution to deal with the pandemic. A multitude of anti-viral regimens is proposed based on the repurposing of currently available drugs for other issues or the compassionate use of drugs to immediately control and optimize the healthcare facilities. Meanwhile, a number of agencies are proposing new drug candidates to recreate the possibility of treating the disease. Similarly, a lot of research work is going on worldwide for the development of vaccination. Currently, a good number of candidates has finally reached the borders of Clinical Trials and are expected to be launched as soon as possible. However, the regulatory framework and authorization of these candidates is the most significant aspect of the whole scenario, which needs a specific set of time for validation purposes. The present work is widely focused on the general aspects of COVID-19 and the regulatory landscape for the emergency authorization of repurposed drug candidates, compassionate use of drugs, investigational entities, and vaccine development worldwide.

However, there is still a widespread lack of testing in the US and many of the clinical diagnostics protocols require extensive human labor and materials, such as RNA extraction kits, that could face supply shortages and present biosafety concerns. Given the need to develop alternative reagents and approaches to allow nucleic-acid testing in the face of heightened demand and potential shortages, we have developed a simplified SARS-CoV-2 testing protocol adapted for its use in laboratory research with minimal molecular biology equipment and expertise.

649438,Inter-Professional Collaboration and Occupational Well-Being of Physicians Who Work in Adverse Working Conditions,2021-09-14,"BACKGROUND: The Onset PrevenTIon of urinary retention in Orthopaedic Nursing and rehabilitation, OPTION, project aims to progress knowledge translation vis-à-vis evidence-based bladder monitoring in orthopaedic care, to decrease the risk of urinary retention, and voiding complications. Urinary retention is common whilst in hospital for hip surgery. If not properly identified and managed, there is a high risk of complications, some lifelong and life threatening. Although evidence-based guidelines are available, the implementation is lagging. METHODS: Twenty orthopaedic sites are cluster randomised into intervention and control sites, respectively. The intervention sites assemble local facilitator teams among nursing and rehabilitation staff, including first-line managers. The teams receive a 12-month support programme, including face-to-face events and on-demand components to map and bridge barriers to guideline implementation, addressing leadership behaviours and de-implementation of unproductive routines. All sites have access to the guidelines via a public healthcare resource, but the control sites have no implementation support. Baseline data collection includes structured assessments of urinary retention procedures via patient records, comprising incidence and severity of voiding issues and complications, plus interviews with managers and staff, and surveys to all hip surgery patients with interviews across all sites. Further assessments of context include the Alberta Context Tool used with staff, the 4Ps tool for preference-based patient participation used with patients, and data on economic aspects of urinary bladder care. During the implementation intervention, all events are recorded, and the facilitators keep diaries. Post intervention, the equivalent data collections will be repeated twice, and further data will include experiences of the intervention and guideline implementation. Data will be analysed with statistical analyses, including comparisons before and after, and between intervention and control sites. The qualitative data are subjected to content analysis, and mixed methods are applied to inform both clinical outcomes and the process evaluation, corresponding to a hybrid design addressing effectiveness, experiences, and outcomes. DISCUSSION: The OPTION trial has a potential to account for barriers and enablers for guideline implementation in the orthopaedic context in general and hip surgery care in particular. Further, it may progress the understanding of implementation leadership by dyads of facilitators and first-line managers. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered as NCT04700969 with the U.S. National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials Registry on 8 January 2021, that is, prior to the baseline data collection.","Eldh, Ann Catrine; Joelsson-Alm, Eva; Wretenberg, Per; Hälleberg-Nyman, Maria",Implement Sci,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13012-021-01135-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34174917/,273

Nuestro objetivo fue estudiar en qué medida la cuarentena afectó el bienestar y los síntomas conductuales de sujetos con demencia que viven en la comunidad y sus cuidadores luego de las 8 semanas iniciales de aislamiento obligatorio. Métodos: Familiares de 119 pacientes con Demencia tipo Alzheimer (DTA) o trastornos relacionados que viven en la comunidad fueron invitados a participar de forma anónima y voluntaria de una encuesta exploratoria, de tipo transversal o sincrónica, y con formato electrónico. Se utilizó estadística descriptiva y el test de chi cuadrado con un valor de significancia de p<0.05 para analizar las diferencias según la severidad de la demencia. Resultados: La edad media de los sujetos con demencia fue 81.16 (± 7.03), 35% tenían >85. El 67% tenía DTA y el 26% demencia mixta. El 34.5% tenían demencia leve, 32% moderada, 33% severa. En el 67 % de los casos, el cuidador principal era familiar. Se observó un aumento de ansiedad (43%), insomnio (28%), depresión (29%), empeoramiento de la marcha (41%) y aumento del uso de psicofármacos. La frecuencia de síntomas conductuales fue mayor en sujetos con demencia leve (p<0.05). En casi todos los casos la rehabilitación fue suspendida durante la cuarentena. Hubo un aumento significativo de la sobrecarga del cuidador durante la pandemia (t= -8.657, p<0.001). Conclusiones: Tanto los sujetos con demencia que viven en la comunidad como sus cuidadores mostraron un empeoramiento de su bienestar y estado de salud durante la pandemia de COVID-19, debido a una combinación multifactorial de aislamiento social, ausencia de rehabilitación, aumento del estrés del cuidador, miedo de contraer la enfermedad entre otras causas. Es necesario desarrollar un plan de acción coordinado y urgente que involucre a las familias de los pacientes, las autoridades sanitarias y el personal de salud que habitualmente atiende a estos pacientes para mitigar el impacto negativo de la cuarentena y epidemia en la salud de los sujetos con demencia que viven en la comunidad. Introduction: In Argentina, the quality of care that elderly subjects with dementia living in the community received has been deeply affected by COVID-19 epidemic. Our objective was to study to what extend mandatory quarantine imposed due to COVID-19 had affected behavioral symptoms in subjects with dementia after the first 8 weeks of quarantine. Methods: Relatives of 119 patients with Alzheimer-type Dementia or related disorders living in the community were invited to participate anonymously and voluntarily in an exploratory, cross-sectional and synchronous survey. Characteristics of people with dementia and their caregivers were analyzed with descriptive statistics using the chi-square tests, p < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: Mean age: 81.16 (±7.03), 35% of the subjects had more than 85 years of age. Diagnosis were 67% Alzheimer´s dementia and 26% mixed Alzheimer´s disease. Stages were 34.5% mild cases, 32% intermediate stage, and 33% severe cases as per Clinical dementia Rating score. In 67% of the sample, a family member was the main caregiver. Important findings were increased anxiety (43% of the sample), insomnia (28% of the subjects), depression (29%), worsening gait disturbance (41%), and increase use of psychotropics to control behavioral symptoms. Behavioral symptoms were more prevalent in subjects with mild dementia compared to subjects with severe dementia. Rehabilitation services had been discontinued in most subjects due to the quarantine. COVID-19 confinement increased stress caregiver (t= -8.657, p<0.001). Conclusion: We concluded from our analysis that during COVID-19 epidemic there was a deterioration of behavioral symptoms in our population of elderly dementia subjects living in the community. Perhaps, our findings are related to a combination of social isolation, lack of outpatient rehabilitation services, and increased stress of family caregivers. It is necessary to develop a plan of action to help dementia subjects deal with the increased stress that this epidemic imposed on them.","Russo, María Julieta; Cohen, Gabriela; Campos, Jorge; Allegri, Ricardo F",Neurología Argentina,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1853002821000574; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuarg.2021.06.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1853002821000574?v=s5,273

We conducted a meta-analysis to assess the association between influenza vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 infection and clinical outcomes, aiming to provide evidence for COVID-19 prevention and vaccination promotion. We searched four databases from inception to 10 March, 2021. Random effects and fixed effects models were used to pool odds ratios (ORs) and adjusted estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used funnel plots to evaluate the publication bias, I2 statistics to evaluate the heterogeneity, and conducted subgroup analyses. Sixteen observational studies involving 290,327 participants were included. Influenza vaccination was associated with a lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (pooled adjusted OR: 0.86, 95%CI: 0.81–0.91), while not significantly associated with adverse outcomes (intensive care: adjusted OR 0.63, 95%CI: 0.22–1.81; hospitalization: adjusted OR 0.74, 95%CI: 0.51–1.06; mortality: adjusted OR 0.89, 95%CI: 0.73–1.09).

ITP is a known complication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In the first studies of the BNT162b2 messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccine, there were no reports of ITP and the incidence of serious adverse events (AEs) was low overall. Here, we present a case of ITP as a complication of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. CASE REPORT: Three days after receiving a second dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, a 39-year-old woman presented with a petechial rash on her trunk, legs, and arms, and fatigue and muscle aches. At the time of her hospital admission, her platelet count was 1000/µL. A peripheral smear showed profound thrombocytopenia. During the course of the patient’s hospitalization, she was treated with 2 units of platelets, 2 infusions of i.v. immunoglobulin, and i.v. methylprednisolone. Her platelet count increased to 92 000/µL on the day of discharge and she was prescribed a tapered dose of oral prednisone. One day later, her rash had resolved and her platelet count was 243 000/µL. The patient recovered completely with no complications. CONCLUSIONS: ITP should be considered a severe AE of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Knowing the early signs and symptoms of ITP will become increasingly important as more of the population receives this vaccine. Quick diagnosis and management are essential to avoid life-threatening bleeding.","King, Eleanor R.; Towner, Elizabeth",Am J Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34285180/; https://doi.org/10.12659/ajcr.931478,273

653368,Interactive virtual medication counselling in outpatient pharmacy: An accessible and safe patient counselling method during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021-07-03,"This chapter makes the case against performing exceptionally dangerous gain-of-function experiments that are designed to create potentially pandemic and novel strains of influenza, for example, by enhancing the airborne transmissibility in mammals of highly virulent avian influenza strains. This is a question of intense debate over the last 5 years, though the history of such experiments goes back at least to the synthesis of viable influenza A H1N1 (1918) based on material preserved from the 1918 pandemic. This chapter makes the case that experiments to create potential pandemic pathogens (PPPs) are nearly unique in that they present biosafety risks that extend well beyond the experimenter or laboratory performing them; an accidental release could, as the name suggests, lead to global spread of a virulent virus, a biosafety incident on a scale never before seen. In such cases, biosafety considerations should be uppermost in the consideration of alternative approaches to experimental objectives and design, rather than being settled after the fact, as is appropriately done for most research involving pathogens. The extensive recent discussion of the magnitude of risks from such experiments is briefly reviewed. The chapter argues that, while there are indisputably certain questions that can be answered only by gain-of-function experiments in highly pathogenic strains, these questions are narrow and unlikely to meaningfully advance public health goals such as vaccine production and pandemic prediction. Alternative approaches to experimental influenza virology and characterization of existing strains are in general completely safe, higher throughput, more generalizable, and less costly than creation of PPP in the laboratory and can thereby better inform public health. Indeed, virtually every finding of recent PPP experiments that has been cited for its public health value was predated by similar findings using safe methodologies. The chapter concludes that the unique scientific and public health value of PPP experiments is inadequate to justify the unique risks they entail and that researchers would be well-advised to turn their talents to other methodologies that will be safe and more rewarding scientifically.","Lipsitch, Marc",Influenza Virus,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-8678-1_29; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30151594/,273

METHODS: A survey was conducted to determine whether temperature screening successfully identified workers with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among a convenience sample of medical directors of multinational corporations in a wide range of industries. RESULTS: More than 15 million screenings were performed by 14 companies. Fewer than 700 episodes of fever were identified. Of these, only about 53 cases of COVID-19 were detected. By contrast about 2000 workers with diagnosed COVID-19 were in the workplace and not detected by screening.

Although the situation is stable to some extent within the developed countries, approximately one million have already died as a consequence of the unique symptomatology that these people displayed. Thus, the need to develop an effective strategy for monitoring, restricting, but especially for predicting the evolution of COVID-19 is urgent, especially in middle-class countries such as Romania. Material and Methods: Therefore, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models have been created, aiming to predict the epidemiological course of COVID-19 in Romania by using two statistical software (STATGRAPHICS Centurion (v.18.1.13) and IBM SPSS (v.20.0.0)). To increase the accuracy, we collected data between the established interval (1 March, 31 August) from the official website of the Romanian Government and the World Health Organization. Results: Several ARIMA models were generated from which ARIMA (1,2,1), ARIMA (3,2,2), ARIMA (3,1,3), ARIMA (3,2,2), ARIMA (3,1,3), ARIMA (2,2,2) and ARIMA (1,2,1) were considered the best models. For this, we took into account the lowest value of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for March, April, May, June, July, and August (MAPE(March) = 9.3225, MAPE(April) = 0.975287, MAPE(May) = 0.227675, MAPE(June) = 0.161412, MAPE(July) = 0.243285, MAPE(August) = 0.163873, MAPE(March – August) = 2.29175 for STATGRAPHICS Centurion (v.18.1.13) and MAPE(March) = 57.505, MAPE(April) = 1.152, MAPE(May) = 0.259, MAPE(June) = 0.185, MAPE(July) = 0.307, MAPE(August) = 0.194, and MAPE(March – August) = 6.013 for IBM SPSS (v.20.0.0) respectively.

However, it is unclear whether individuals are aware of disease risk and alter their behaviour early in the pandemic. We investigated risk perception and self-reported engagement in protective behaviours in 1591 United States-based individuals cross-sectionally and longitudinally over the first week of the pandemic. Subjects demonstrated growing awareness of risk and reported engaging in protective behaviours with increasing frequency but underestimated their risk of infection relative to the average person in the country. Social distancing and hand washing were most strongly predicted by the perceived probability of personally being infected. However, a subgroup of individuals perceived low risk and did not engage in these behaviours.

However, the investment of resources in primary care institutions is not based on the actual medical demands of the public. This study analysed primary care utilization to provide targeted guidance for the improvement of primary healthcare delivery in China. METHODS: We extracted outpatient visit data from all community healthcare centres in Shanghai from 2014 to 2018. Diseases were then classified according to ICD-10 codes. The disease spectrum (frequency, proportion, rank) was stratified by sex, age, and region. RESULTS: Most primary care outpatients were female (58.20%), 60–79 years old (57.91%), and in suburban regions (62.18%). Chronic diseases accounted for the majority (91.41%). Hypertension, chronic ischaemic heart disease, diabetes, and acute upper respiratory tract infections were the top four disorders for primary care visits regardless of sex. In the group aged 0–18 years, symptoms, signs and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings not elsewhere classified accounted for 37.96% of the top 20 reasons. Acute upper respiratory tract infections were the most common diseases in the groups aged 0–18 (11.20%) and 19–39 (11.14%) years. However, hypertension was the most common disease in the group aged > 39 years old (> 20%). There were more outpatients with respiratory and digestive diseases in suburban areas than in urban areas. In addition, problems associated with medical equipment and other healthcare deficiencies were relatively more common in suburban areas (suburban: 4.13%, rank 5; urban: 2.29%, rank 10). CONCLUSIONS: To meet the patients’ needs and to develop the primary care system, the Shanghai government should focus on diseases with regionally high proportions. Disease diagnosis and treatment should be improved in the younger and suburban populations.","Shi, Jianwei; Chi, Chunhua; Gong, Xin; Chen, Chen; Yu, Wenya; Huang, Jiaoling; Zhou, Liang; Chen, Ning; Yang, Yan; Liu, Qian; Wang, Zhaoxin",BMC Fam Pract,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12875-020-01146-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32349689/,273

COVID-19 pandemic has left its imprints on various health systems globally and caused immense social and economic disruptions. The scientific community across the globe is in a quest for digging the effective treatment for COVID-19 and exploring potential leads from traditional systems of healthcare across the world too. Ayurveda (Indian traditional system of medicine) has a comprehensive aspect of immunity through Rasayana which is a rejuvenation therapy. Here we attempt to generate the potential leads based on the classical text from Ayurveda in general and Rasayana in particular to develop effective antiviral and/or immunomodulator for potential or adjunct therapy in SARS-CoV-2. The Rasayana acts not only by resisting body to restrain or withstand the strength, severity or progression of a disease but also by promoting power of the body to prevent the manifestation of a disease. These Rasayana herbs are common in practice as immunomodulator, antiviral and protectives. The studies on Rasayana can provide an insight into the future course of research for the plausible development of effective management of COVID-19 by the utilization and development of various traditional systems of healthcare. Keeping in view the current pandemic situation, there is an urgent need of developing potential medicines.

660507,Intra-host Ebola viral adaption during human infection,2019-02-20,"BACKGROUND: Thrombosis and coagulopathy are highly prevalent in critically ill patients with COVID-19 and increase the risk of death. Immunothrombosis has recently been demonstrated to contribute to the thrombotic events in COVID-19 patients with coagulopathy. As the primary components of immunothrombosis, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) could be induced by complement cascade components and other proinflammatory mediators. We aimed to explore the clinical roles of NETs and the regulation of complement on the NET formation in COVID-19. METHODS: We recruited 135 COVID-19 patients and measured plasma levels of C5, C3, cell-free DNA and myeloperoxidase (MPO)-DNA. Besides, the formation of NETs was detected by immunofluorescent staining and the cytotoxicity to vascular endothelial HUVEC cells was evaluated by CCK-8 assay. RESULTS: We found that the plasma levels of complements C3 and MPO-DNA were positively related to coagulation indicator fibrin(-ogen) degradation products (C3: r = 0.300, p = 0.005; MPO-DNA: r = 0.316, p = 0.002) in COVID-19 patients. Besides, C3 was positively related to direct bilirubin (r = 0.303, p = 0.004) and total bilirubin (r = 0.304, p = 0.005), MPO-DNA was positively related to lactate dehydrogenase (r = 0.306, p = 0.003) and creatine kinase (r = 0.308, p = 0.004). By using anti-C3a and anti-C5a antibodies, we revealed that the complement component anaphylatoxins in the plasma of COVID-19 patients strongly induced NET formation. The pathological effect of the anaphylatoxin-NET axis on the damage of vascular endothelial cells could be relieved by recombinant carboxypeptidase B (CPB), a stable homolog of enzyme CPB2 which can degrade anaphylatoxins to inactive products. CONCLUSIONS: Over-activation in anaphylatoxin-NET axis plays a pathological role in COVID-19. Early intervention in anaphylatoxins might help prevent thrombosis and disease progression in COVID-19 patients.","Zhang, Yue; Han, Kai; Du, Chunjing; Li, Rui; Liu, Jingyuan; Zeng, Hui; Zhu, Liuluan; Li, Ang",Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33557911/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13054-021-03482-z,273

We find that variations in the time dimension and intensity of various strategies can have vastly different performance outcomes: (i) the timing of NPIs can 'shrink the area under the curve' (cumulative infections) not just 'flatten the curve'; (ii) prolonged lockdowns have diminishing margins of returns; (iii) smooth, submaximal lockdowns perform better than pulsatile lockdowns; and (iv) the efficiency of various strategies incorporating both epidemiological and non-epidemiological outcomes vary substantially.

Recently, there has been considerable investment in developing cell-based meat, an alternative meat production process that does not require the raising and slaughtering of animals, instead using muscle cells cultivated in a bioreactor. We discuss the animal ethics impacts of cell-based and plant-based meat on human-animal interactions from animal welfare and rights perspectives, focusing on industrial meat production scenarios. Our hypothesis is that the insertion of cell-based meat in the global meat market may alleviate farm animal suffering and potentially restore resources for wild fauna. We employed a conservative estimation of the cell-based meat contribution to the global meat market in the year 2040 to analyze the consequences for human-animal relationships for both wild animals and farmed domesticated animals. We discuss possible effects of an animal cell domestication process, previously described as the second domestication, on human-animal relationships. We consider its potential to reduce the impact of human demographic changes and land use on animal life, in particular whether there would be increased biomass availability and free land for wild animals. We anticipate a major reduction in animal suffering due to the decrease in the number of individual animals involved in food production, which justifies the adoption of cell-based meat from a utilitarian perspective. For the conventional animal food production that remains, further consideration is needed to understand which systems, either high or low welfare, will be retained and the impact of the innovation on the average farm animal welfare. Additionally, it seems likely that there will be less acceptance of the necessity of animal suffering in farming systems when meat production is uncoupled from animal raising and slaughter, supported by a deontological perspective of animal ethics. Consequent to this is anticipated the mitigation of relevant barriers to animal protection and to the recognition of animals as subjects by legislation. Thus, the development of the alternative meats may be related to a significant change in our relationship with non-human animals, with greater benefits than the prima facie effects on farm animals.","Heidemann, Marina Sucha; Molento, Carla Forte Maiolino; Reis, Germano Glufk; Phillips, Clive Julian Christie",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32849075/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01824,273

In a pandemic situation, urban hotspots could be potential superspreader areas as visits to urban hotspots can increase the risk of contact and transmission of a disease among a population. We mapped census-block-group to point-of-interest (POI) movement networks in 16 cities in the United States. We adopted a modified coarse-grain approach to examine patterns of visits to POIs among hotspots and non-hotspots from January to May 2020. Also, we conducted chi-square tests to identify POIs with significant flux-in changes during the analysis period. The results showed disparate patterns across cities in terms of reduction in hotspot POI visitors. Sixteen cities were divided into two categories using a time series clustering method. In one category, which includes the cities of San Francisco, Seattle and Chicago, we observed a considerable decrease in hotspot POI visitors, while in another category, including the cities of Austin, Houston and San Diego, the visitors to hotspots did not greatly decrease. While all the cities exhibited overall decreased visitors to POIs, one category maintained the proportion of visitors to hotspot POIs. The proportion of visitors to some POIs (e.g. restaurants) remained stable during the social distancing period, while some POIs had an increased proportion of visitors (e.g. grocery stores). We also identified POIs with significant flux-in changes, indicating that related businesses were greatly affected by social distancing. The study was limited to 16 metropolitan cities in the United States. The proposed methodology could be applied to digital trace data in other cities and countries to study the patterns of movements to POIs during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Li, Qingchun; Bessell, Liam; Xiao, Xin; Fan, Chao; Gao, Xinyu; Mostafavi, Ali",R Soc Open Sci,https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.201209; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33614069/,273

In the absence of a vaccine, a key way to control the pandemic is through behavioural change: people adhering to transmission-reducing behaviours (TRBs), such as physical distancing, hand washing and wearing face covering. Non-adherence may be explained by theories of how people think about the illness (the common-sense model of self-regulation) and/or how they think about the TRBs (social cognition theory and protection motivation theory). In addition, outbreaks of infectious diseases and the measures employed to curb them are likely to have detrimental effects on people’s mental and general health. Therefore, in representative repeated surveys, we will apply behavioural theories to model adherence to TRBs and the effects on mental and general health in the Scottish population from June to November 2020, following the initial outbreak of COVID-19. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Repeated 20 min structured telephone surveys will be conducted with nationally representative random samples of 500 adults in Scotland. The first 6 weeks the survey will be conducted weekly, thereafter fortnightly, for a total of 14 waves (total n=7000). Ipsos MORI will recruit participants through random digit dialling. The core survey will measure the primary outcomes of adherence to TRBs, mental and general health, and explanatory variables from the theories. Further questions will be added, enabling more detailed measurement of constructs in the core survey, additional themes and questions that align with the evolving pandemic.

China, Italy, France, Spain, Germany, United Kingdom, and USA are the worst affected countries. All these countries have robust health care systems but despite this there has been a huge shortage of health care facilities especially intensive care beds in these countries. A country like India has different challenges as far as medical care during this pandemic is concerned. The need of the hour is to improve the health care system as a whole.

The level of devastation by this outbreak is such that highly impacted countries will take years to recover. Studies have shown that timely detection based on accelerated sample testing and accurate diagnosis are crucial steps to reducing or preventing the spread of any pandemic outbreak. In this opinionated review, the impacts of metal organic frameworks (MOFs) as a biosensor in a pandemic outbreak is investigated with reference to COVID-19. Biosensing technologies have been proven to be very effective in clinical analyses, especially in assessment of severe infectious diseases. Polymerase chain reactions (PCR, RT-PCR, CRISPR) - based test methods predominantly used for SARS-COV-2 diagnoses have serious limitations and the health scientists and researchers are urged to come up with a more robust and versatile system for solving diagnostic problem associated with the current and future pandemic outbreaks. MOFs, an emerging crystalline material with unique characteristics will serve as promising biosensing materials in a pandemic outbreak such as the one we are in. We hereby highlight the characteristics of MOFs and their sensing applications, potentials as biosensors in a pandemic outbreak and draw the attention of researchers to a new vista of research that needs immediate action.","Udourioh, Godwin A.; Solomon, Moses M.; Epelle, Emmanuel I.",Cell Mol Bioeng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34249167/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12195-021-00686-9,273
668753,"Magnesium in Aging, Health and Diseases",2021-01-30,"The pandemic caused by novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS‐CoV‐2) has resulted in over 452,822 deaths in the first twenty days of June 2020 due to the coronavirus virus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). The SARS‐CoV‐2 uses the host angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to gain entry inside the human cells where it replicates by using the cell protein synthesis mechanisms. The knowledge of the tissue distribution of ACE2 in human organs is therefore important to predict the clinical course of the COVID‐19. Also important is the understanding of the viral receptor‐binding domain (RBD) a region within the spike (S) proteins that enable the entry of the virus into the host cells to synthesize vaccine and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). We performed an exhaustive search of human protein databases to establish the tissues that express ACE2 and performed an in‐depth analysis like sequence alignments and homology modeling of the spike protein (S) of the SARS‐CoV‐2 to identify antigenic regions in the RBD that can be exploited to synthesize vaccine and mAbs. Our results show that ACE2 is widely expressed in human organs that may explain the pulmonary, systemic, and neurological deficits seen in COVID‐19 patients. We show that though the S protein of the SARS‐CoV‐2 is a homolog of S protein of SARS‐CoV‐1, it has regions of dissimilarities in the RBD and transmembrane segments. We show peptide sequences in the RBD of SARS‐CoV‐2 that can bind to the MHC alleles and serve as effective epitopes for vaccine and mAbs synthesis. This article is protected by copyright.

668945,Psychological Well-being during Covid-19 Lockdown: Insights from a Saudi State University’s Academic Community,2020-12-02,"In this work, we aim to determine the main factors driving self-initiated behavioral changes during the seasonal flu. To this end, we designed and deployed a questionnaire via Influweb, a Web platform for participatory surveillance in Italy, during the 2017 − 18 and 2018 − 19 seasons. We collected 599 surveys completed by 434 users. The data provide socio-demographic information, level of concerns about the flu, past experience with illnesses, and the type of behavioral changes voluntarily implemented by each participant. We describe each response with a set of features and divide them in three target categories. These describe those that report i) no (26%), ii) only moderately (36%), iii) significant (38%) changes in behaviors. In these settings, we adopt machine learning algorithms to investigate the extent to which target variables can be predicted by looking only at the set of features. Notably, 66% of the samples in the category describing more significant changes in behaviors are correctly classified through Gradient Boosted Trees. Furthermore, we investigate the importance of each feature in the classification task and uncover complex relationships between individuals’ characteristics and their attitude towards behavioral change. We find that intensity, recency of past illnesses, perceived susceptibility to and perceived severity of an infection are the most significant features in the classification task and are associated to significant changes in behaviors. Overall, the research contributes to the small set of empirical studies devoted to the data-driven characterization of behavioral changes induced by infectious diseases.","Gozzi, Nicolò; Perrotta, Daniela; Paolotti, Daniela; Perra, Nicola",PLoS Comput Biol,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007879; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32401809/,273

Still, such exploration is challenging as there is a need for visualizations that are tailored for the purpose. RESULTS: The OmicLoupe software was developed to facilitate visual data exploration and provides more than 15 interactive cross-dataset visualizations for omics data. It expands visualizations to multiple datasets for quality control, statistical comparisons and overlap and correlation analyses, while allowing for rapid inspection and downloading of selected features. The usage of OmicLoupe is demonstrated in three different studies, where it allowed for detection of both technical data limitations and biological trends across different omic layers. An example is an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on two previously published studies, where OmicLoupe facilitated the identification of gene products with consistent expression changes across datasets at both the transcript and protein levels. CONCLUSIONS: OmicLoupe provides fast exploration of omics data with tailored visualizations for comparisons within and across data layers. The interactive visualizations are highly informative and are expected to be useful in various analyses of both newly generated and previously published data.

The data were obtained from the medicine sales staff working at drug retail outlets of Bahawalpur, Punjab, Pakistan, through in‐depth face‐to‐face interviews using a semi‐structured interview guide. A two‐step sampling strategy was used, including purposive and convenient sampling techniques. Sample size was determined by applying the saturation point criteria. A total of 17 interviews were audio‐recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using the thematic analysis. Analysis of data yielded six themes and seven sub‐themes. The themes included (1) knowledge about various aspects of COVID‐19, (2) practices of sales staff in response to COVID‐19 pandemic, (3) attitude of sales staff towards COVID‐19 pandemic, (4) services offered to presumptive COVID‐19 patients, (5) challenges encountered during pandemic and (6) suggestions to improve delivery of pharmacy services by sales staff.

While there are numerous functioning antifungal therapies, their high cost, substantial side effects and fear of overt resistance development preclude permanent prophylactic medication of risk-patients. Hence, a fast and definitive diagnosis of IPA is desirable, to quickly identify those patients that really require aggressive antimycotic treatment and to follow the course of the therapeutic intervention. However, despite decades of research into this issue, such a diagnostic procedure is still not available. Here, we discuss the array of currently available methods for IPA detection and their limits. We then show that molecular imaging using positron emission tomography (PET) combined with morphological computed tomography or magnetic imaging is highly promising to become a future non-invasive approach for IPA diagnosis and therapy monitoring, albeit still requiring thorough validation and relying on further acceptance and dissemination of the approach. Thereby, our approach using the A. fumigatus-specific humanized monoclonal antibody hJF5 labelled with (64)Cu as PET-tracer has proven highly effective in pre-clinical models and hence bears high potential for human application.","Gunzer, Matthias; Thornton, Christopher R.; Beziere, Nicolas",J Fungi (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/jof6040338; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33291706/,273

DESIGN: Retrospective observational study to assess attendance, attrition, and patient outcomes. SETTING: ICU Recovery Clinic. PATIENTS: Adult patients recently admitted to ICU for sepsis or acute respiratory failure and who were referred to clinic. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients (63%) attended ICU recovery clinic with a mean age of 53.2 ± 16 years (range, 20–82 yr), 42% female and mean Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores at an ICU admission of 9.4 ± 2.9 participated in outcomes. Twelve patients (32%) were lost to follow up and 12 patients (32%) were transferred to different providers before the end of 1 year. Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores were negatively associated with health-related quality of life at baseline (r = –0.41; p = 0.033; n = 28) and short term (r = –0.40; p = 0.037; n = 27). Male patients had higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores (mean difference = 2.4; t = 2.779; p = 0.008) and longer hospital length of stay (mean difference = 9.3; t = 2.27; p = 0.029). Female patients had higher scores on Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (mean difference = 7.2; t = 2.74; p = 0.01) and Impact of Events Scale-Revised (mean difference = 18.9; t = 2.74; p = 0.011) at the initial follow-up visit. Patients never attending clinic were more likely to live further away, have a tracheotomy, and spent longer time in the ICU.

A 5:1 cluster randomisation was performed at school level for the intervention group (IG) or the control group (CG). The twice-weekly 45 min intervention was the '11 for Health in Denmark' programme, which includes health education, football drills and small-sided games. The health education element focused on hygiene, nutrition, physical activity and well-being. Outcomes: The participants completed a 34-item multiple-choice computer-based health knowledge questionnaire preintervention and postintervention. IG also evaluated whether the programme was enjoyable.ResultsBetween-group differences (p<0.05) were observed in overall health knowledge in favour of IG (+7.2% points, 95% CI 6.1% to 8.4%, effect size, ES:0.59), with similar effects for girls (+7.4% points, 95% CI 5.9% to 9.0%, ES:0.57) and for boys (+7.0% points, 95% CI 5.3% to 8.7%, p<0.05, ES:0.51).

PRESENTATION OF CASE: Male patient, 69 years old, asthmatic, ex-smoker and bearer of systemic arterial hypertension, has been admitted to the emergency department with sudden onset of pain in the right lower limb (RLL), associated with cyanosis and reduced temperature of the limb. He has been tested for COVID-19 in the OR with positive result for IGG and IGM. Computed tomography angiography (AngioCT) was performed, showing signs of arterial embolization to both limbs, right internal iliac artery, and superior mesenteric artery. Faced with the threat of limb loss and the absence of signs and symptoms of visceral ischemia, the patient underwent full anticoagulation and RLL thromboembolectomy and tricompartmental fasciotomy. He was discharged after 7 days of hospitalization and demonstrated no other signs and symptoms of COVID-19, following outpatient follow-up. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 is associated with high risk of thrombotic complications being related to the clinical severity of the patient, with few studies that show symptoms of sudden pain in the lower limb without other complaints. CONCLUSION: Individuals infected with COVID-19 are at risk for arterial thromboembolic events, and knowledge of such cases is essential in order to create specific protocols for prophylaxis of thrombotic events in these patients, in addition to increasing the suspicion of infection in individuals with acute arterial occlusion, mostly during pandemic times.","de Oliveira Costa, Víctor; de Almeida, Guilherme Bicalho Civinelli; Nicolini, Eveline Montessi; de Abreu Rodrigues, Guilherme; da Costa, Bruna Malaquias Arguelles; Carvalho, Guilherme Heluey; dos Reis, Álvaro Luiz Segregio; Colen, Davi Pinto",Int J Surg Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33200062/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2210261220310695; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210261220310695?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2020.11.046,273

It is blind to its long history in marginalized, oppressed, and displaced communities where home gardens have always been part of a struggle for identity, autonomy, and self- and communal-determination. I argue the blindness embedded in the narrative of COVID victory gardens violates our “food-related obligations,” which are our responsibilities to ourselves, our food, and each other. Silencing how communities of color have historically grown food in pursuit of dignity disregards how home gardens in communities of color are not merely a reactionary response to crisis but part of a historical legacy whereby people of color have grown food for generations to create and recreate sustainable ways of living that validate their cultures, knowledges, and ways of being.","Valle, Gabriel R.",Food Ethics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33898736/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s41055-021-00088-7,273

Even though cynomolgus macaques from different geographic regions are used for these studies, there has been limited characterization of full-length major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I immunogenetics of distinct geographic populations. Here, we identified 48 MHC class I cDNA nucleotide sequences in eleven Indonesian cynomolgus macaques, including 41 novel Mafa-A and Mafa-B sequences. We found seven MHC class I sequences in Indonesian macaques that were identical to MHC class I sequences identified in Malaysian or Mauritian macaques. Sharing of nucleotide sequences between these geographically distinct populations is also consistent with the hypothesis that Indonesia was a source of the Mauritian macaque population. In addition, we found that the Indonesian cDNA sequence Mafa-B*7601 is identical throughout its peptide binding domain to Mamu-B*03, an allele that has been associated with control of Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) viremia in Indian rhesus macaques. Overall, a better understanding of the MHC class I alleles present in Indonesian cynomolgus macaques improves their value as a model for disease research, and it better defines the biogeography of cynomolgus macaques throughout Southeast Asia.","Pendley, Chad J.; Becker, Ericka A.; Karl, Julie A.; Blasky, Alex J.; Wiseman, Roger W.; Hughes, Austin L.; O’Connor, Shelby L.; O’Connor, David H.",Immunogenetics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00251-008-0292-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18504574/,273

Hence, in the present study, we will add electroacupuncture intervention based on oral prednisone tablets in the acute phase of IFP and compare the clinical effects with simple oral prednisone tablets. Besides, the prognosis and safety will be evaluated. The present study aims to evaluate the clinical efficacy, prognosis, and safety of electroacupuncture combined with oral prednisone tablets in the acute phase of IFP, using surface electromyography (sEMG) to objectively observe the recovery of facial expression muscle function. In addition, the morphological changes of the facial nerve were observed dynamically by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the acute phase to reveal the effect mechanism of this therapy. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials will be conducted in the first teaching hospital of Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine in China from September 2020 to April 2021. The treatment will be carried out in two phases, including the acute phase and the recovery phase. Eighty IFP patients will be recruited and randomized into two groups with a 1:1 ratio. Subjects in the acute phases of the control group will be given oral prednisone tablets, based on the control group, and subjects of the experimental group will be given electroacupuncture therapy simultaneously in the acute phase. Both groups will be stopped taking prednisone tablets and turn to electroacupuncture therapy in a recovery phase. Patients in the experimental group will receive treatment at least 6 times in the acute phase and both groups will receive treatment 9 times in the recovery phase, and there will be a follow-up period of 15 days after the treatment. The primary outcome is supposed to be related to the changes observed in the Sunnybrook (Toronto) Facial Grading System (SFGS) on the baseline and day 30 after the onset. Secondary outcome measures will include House-Brackmann Facial Nerve Grading System (H-B), measurement of Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), Facial Disability Index scale (FDI, including physical function subscore, FDIP, and social functioning and well-being subscore, FDIS), surface electromyogram (sEMG), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Adverse events will be recorded for safety assessment. DISCUSSION: The results of this trial will allow the present study to compare the difference in efficacy and prognosis between the strategy of combined electroacupuncture in the acute phase and only oral prednisone tablets.

However, the estimated annual figure of almost 60 000 human rabies fatalities is probably an underestimate. Almost all cases of human rabies result from bites from infected dogs. Therefore, the most cost-effective approach to elimination of the global burden of human rabies is to control canine rabies rather than expansion of the availability of human prophylaxis. Mass vaccination campaigns with parenteral vaccines, and advances in oral vaccines for wildlife, have allowed the elimination of rabies in terrestrial carnivores in several countries worldwide. The subsequent reduction in cases of human rabies in such regions advocates the multidisciplinary One Health approach to rabies control through the mass vaccination of dogs and control of canine populations.","Fooks, Anthony R; Banyard, Ashley C; Horton, Daniel L; Johnson, Nicholas; McElhinney, Lorraine M; Jackson, Alan C",The Lancet,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140673613627075; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24828901/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673613627075; https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(13)62707-5,273
680010,Resilience Among Professional Health Workers in Emergency Services,2020-09-19,"Automatic segmentation of lung opacification from computed tomography (CT) images shows excellent potential for quickly and accurately quantifying the infection of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and judging the disease development and treatment response. However, some challenges still exist, including the complexity and variability features of the opacity regions, the small difference between the infected and healthy tissues, and the noise of CT images. Due to limited medical resources, it is impractical to obtain a large amount of data in a short time, which further hinders the training of deep learning models. To answer these challenges, we proposed a novel spatial- and channel-wise coarse-to-fine attention network (SCOAT-Net), inspired by the biological vision mechanism, for the segmentation of COVID-19 lung opacification from CT images. With the UNet++ as basic structure, our SCOAT-Net introduces the specially designed spatial-wise and channel-wise attention modules, which serve to collaboratively boost the attention learning of the network and extract the efficient features of the infected opacification regions at the pixel and channel levels. Experiments show that our proposed SCOAT-Net achieves better results compared to several state-of-the-art image segmentation networks and has acceptable generalization ability.","Zhao, Shixuan; Li, Zhidan; Chen, Yang; Zhao, Wei; Xie, Xingzhi; Liu, Jun; Zhao, Di; Li, Yongjie",Pattern Recognit,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S003132032100296X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patcog.2021.108109; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34127870/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003132032100296X?v=s5,273

Most of its primary epidemiological aspects are not appropriately known, which has a direct effect on monitoring, practices and controls. The main objective of this work is to propose a high speed, accurate and highly sensitive CT scan approach for diagnosis of COVID19. The CT scan images display several small patches of shadows and interstitial shifts, particularly in the lung periphery. The proposed method utilizes the ResNet architecture Convolution Neural Network for training the images provided by the CT scan to diagnose the coronavirus-affected patients effectively. By comparing the testing images with the training images, the affected patient is identified accurately. The accuracy and specificity are obtained 95.09% and 81.89%, respectively, on the sample dataset based on CT images without the inclusion of another set of data such as geographical location, population density, etc. Also, the sensitivity is obtained 100% in this method. Based on the results, it is evident that the COVID-19 positive patients can be classified perfectly by using the proposed method.","Raajan, N. R.; Lakshmi, V. S.

681369,The Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic Social Restrictions on Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder and Their Caregivers in the State of Qatar: A cross-sectional study,2021-09-30,"PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to purify and characterize Ebola virus glycoprotein (GP)-specific IgG antibodies from hybridoma clones. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For hybridoma production, mice were injected by intramuscular-electroporation with GP DNA vaccines, and boosted with GP vaccines. The spleen cells were used for producing GP-specific hybridoma. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western blot assay, flow cytometry, and virus-neutralizing assay were used to test the ability of monoclonal IgG antibodies to recognize GP and neutralize Ebola virus. RESULTS: Twelve hybridomas, the cell supernatants of which displayed GP-binding activity by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the presence of both IgG heavy and light chains by Western blot assay, were chosen as a possible IgG producer. Among these, five clones (C36-1, D11-3, D12-1, D34-2, and E140-2) were identified to secrete monoclonal IgG antibodies. When the monoclonal IgG antibodies from the 5 clones were tested for their antigen specificity, they recognized GP in an antigen-specific and IgG dose-dependent manner. They remained reactive to GP at the lowest tested concentrations (1.953–7.8 ng/mL). In particular, IgG antibodies from clones D11-3, D12-1, and E140-2 recognized the native forms of GP expressed on the cell surface. These antibodies were identified as IgG1, IgG2a, or IgG2b kappa types and appeared to recognize the native forms of GP, but not the denatured forms of GP, as determined by Western blot assay. Despite their GP-binding activity, none of the IgG antibodies neutralized Ebola virus infection in vitro, suggesting that these antibodies are unable to neutralize Ebola virus infection. CONCLUSION: This study shows that the purified IgG antibodies from 5 clones (C36-1, D11-3, D12-1, D34-2, and E140-2) possess GP-binding activity but not Ebola virus-neutralizing activity.","Han, Baek-Sang; Jang, Ho-Young; Racine, Trina; Qiu, Xiangguo; Sin, Jeong-Im",Clin Exp Vaccine Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30112351/; https://doi.org/10.7774/cevr.2018.7.2.119,273

This study tested the effect of angiotensin II type I receptor blocker, losartan, on SARS-CoV-2 replication and inhibition of the papain-like protease of the virus. METHODS The dose-dependent inhibitory effect of losartan, in concentrations from 1μM to 100μM as determined by quantitative cell analysis combining fluorescence microscopy, image processing, and cellular measurements (Cellomics analysis) on SARS-CoV-2 replication was investigated in Vero E6 cells. The impact of losartan on deubiquitination and deISGylation of SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PLpro) were also evaluated. Results: Losartan reduced PLpro cleavage of tetraUbiquitin to diUbiquitin. It was less effective in inhibiting PLpro's cleavage of ISG15-AMC than Ubiquitin-AMC. To determine if losartan inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication, losartan treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero E6 was examined. Losartan treatment one hour prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection reduced levels of SARS-CoV-2 nuclear protein, an indicator of virus replication, by 80% and treatment one-hour post-infection decreased viral replication by 70%. CONCLUSION Losartan was not an effective inhibitor of deubiquitinase or deISGylase activity of the PLpro but affected the SARS-CoV-2 replication of Vero E6 cells in vitro. As losartan has a favorable safety profile and is currently available it has features necessary for efficacious drug repurposing and treatment of COVID-19.","Nejat, Reza; Sadr, Ahmad Shahir; Freitas, Branden; Crabttree, Jackelyn; Pegan, Scott D; Tripp, Ralph A; Najafi, David","Journal of pharmacy & pharmaceutical sciences : a publication of the Canadian Society for Pharmaceutical Sciences, Societe canadienne des sciences pharmaceutiques",https://doi.org/10.18433/jpps31931; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34319871/,273

Therefore, we analyzed the specificity of the current pandemic and proposed a concept and a measure of individual differences in the sense of responsibility for collective health (SRCH). This concept reflects individual's others-oriented approach to the pandemic. It refers to an individual's concern for collective health and the feeling of obligation to contribute to contain the pandemic in one's social environment. The results of Study 1 confirmed SRCH as the strongest predictor of the acceptance of pandemic-related restrictions, when comparing its predictive value with that of pandemic-related worries (considered a context-specific but self-oriented tendency) and two general traits indicating high orientation towards the self (i.e., grandiose and vulnerable narcissism). In Study 2, we compared the ability of SRCH to predict increased hygiene and social distancing with that of pandemic-related worries and narcissistic traits, and of social responsibility personal values—treated as others-oriented personality trait. The results revealed that SRCH explained most of the variance in social distancing, whereas pandemic-related worries predicted most of the variance in hygiene practices, although leaving SRCH a significant predictor.","Lachowicz-Tabaczek, Kinga; Kozłowska, Monika A.",Pers Individ Dif,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0191886921005171; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886921005171; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2021.111138; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34511682/,273

The aim of this study was to test two commercially available reaction mixtures in a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay to detect feline Coronavirus (FCoV) in body cavity effusions of cats with and without FIP, in order to minimize the time from sampling to obtaining results. RNA was extracted from body cavity effusion samples of 71 cats, including 34 samples from cats with a definitive diagnosis of FIP, and 37 samples of control cats with similar clinical signs but other confirmed diseases. Two reaction mixtures (Isothermal Mastermix, OptiGene Ltd.and PCRun™ Molecular Detection Mix, Biogal) were tested using the same primers, which were designed to bind to a conserved region of the FCoV membrane protein gene. Both assays were conducted under isothermal conditions (61 °C–62 °C). Using the Isothermal Mastermix of OptiGene Ltd., amplification times ranged from 4 and 39 min with a sensitivity of 35.3% and a specificity of 94.6% for the reported sample group. Using the PCRun™ Molecular Detection Mix of Biogal, amplification times ranged from 18 to 77 min with a sensitivity of 58.8% and a specificity of 97.3%. Although the RT-LAMP assay is less sensitive than real time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), it can be performed without the need of expensive equipment and with less hands-on time. Further modifications of primers might lead to a suitable in-house test and accelerate the diagnosis of FIP.","Günther, Sonja; Felten, Sandra; Wess, Gerhard; Hartmann, Katrin; Weber, Karin",J Virol Methods,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093417305761; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29540320/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2018.03.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093417305761,273
683644,"Commentary on: The SARS, MERS and novel coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemics, the newest and biggest global health threats: what lessons have we learned? A One Health approach to coronaviruses",2020-04-29,"The rapid detection of ongoing outbreak – and the identification of causative pathogen – is pivotal for the early recognition of public health threats. The emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases are linked to several determinants, both human factors – such as population density, travel, and trade – and ecological factors – like climate change and agricultural practices. Several technologies are available for the rapid molecular identification of pathogens [e.g. real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)], and together with on line monitoring tools of infectious disease activity and behaviour, they contribute to the surveillance system for infectious diseases. Web-based surveillance tools, infectious diseases modelling and epidemic intelligence methods represent crucial components for timely outbreak detection and rapid risk assessment. The study aims to integrate the current prevention and control system with a prediction tool for infectious diseases, based on regression analysis, to support decision makers, health care workers, and first responders to quickly and properly recognise an outbreak. This study has the intention to develop an infectious disease regressive prediction tool working with an off-line database built with specific epidemiological parameters of a set of infectious diseases of high consequences. The tool has been developed as a first prototype of a software solution called Infectious Diseases Seeker (IDS) and it had been established in two main steps, the database building stage and the software implementation stage (MATLAB(®) environment). The IDS has been tested with the epidemiological data of three outbreaks occurred recently: severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in China (2002–2003), plague outbreak in Madagascar (2017) and the Ebola virus disease outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (2018). The outcomes are promising and they reveal that the software has been able to recognize and characterize these outbreaks. The future perspective about this software regards the developing of that tool as a useful and user-friendly predictive tool appropriate for first responders, health care workers, and public health decision makers to help them in predicting, assessing and contrasting outbreaks.","Baldassi, F.; Cenciarelli, O.; Malizia, A.; Gaudio, P.",J Epidemiol Glob Health,https://doi.org/10.2991/jegh.k.200714.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32959625/,273

The aim of this study was to outline the main issues that led tobacco smoking being discussed as a potential risk factor associated with COVID-19. METHODS: articles from MEDLINE and pre-prints published from January to April 2020 were identified. RESULTS: data from China showed that men had more severe outcomes of COVID-19 than women. Since smoking prevalence is very high among Chinese men in comparison to women, it was hypothesized that smoking could be a risk factor for poor prognosis. This was also supported by the higher prevalence of comorbidities, many of which tobacco-related diseases, in patients with severe COVID-19, who were also more likely to have a smoking history. A meta-analysis confirmed these results, reporting an OR=2.25 (95% CI: 1.49-3.39) for developing severe COVID-19 among patients with a smoking history. Some authors, noticing that reported smoking prevalence among hospitalized patients was substantially lower than smoking prevalence in the source populations, speculated a protective role of nicotine. However, it is likely that low prevalence among hospitalized patients are partially due to many smokers misclassified as nonsmokers. Tobacco smoking seems to cause a dose-dependent upregulation of angiotensin-converting-enzyme-2 (ACE2), the virus cellular entry receptor, which could explain the higher risk of severe COVID-19 in smokers. CONCLUSIONS: There is need for further independent studies to clarify the role of smoking on COVID-19 incidence, progression and mortality.

They can be used as an avian culture model to better understand osteogenic, adipogenic, and myogenic pathways. Moreover, MSCs could also be used as a model to study various developmental and physiological processes in avian and other species. To obtain a comprehensive overview of this topic, the keywords “mesenchymal stem cells”, “chicken”, “disease”, “chicken dermatitis”, “viral infections in chicken”, and “antibiotics in chicken” were searched in WOS and PUBMED databases to obtain relevant information. ABSTRACT: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent progenitor cells that adhere to plastic; express the specific markers CD29, CD44, CD73, CD90, and CD105; and produce cytokines and growth factors supporting and regulating hematopoiesis. MSCs have capacity for differentiating into osteocytes, chondrocytes, adipocytes, and myocytes. They are useful for research toward better understanding the pathogenic potential of the infectious bursal disease virus, mineralization during osteogenesis, and interactions between MSCs as a feeder layer to other cells. MSCs are also important for immunomodulatory cell therapy, can provide a suitable strategy model for coculture with pathogens causing dermatitis disorders in chickens, can be cultured in vitro with probiotics and prebiotics with a view to eliminate the feeding of antibiotic growth promoters, and offer cell-based meat production. Moreover, bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) in coculture with hematopoietic progenitor/stem cells (HPCs/HSCs) can support expansion and regulation of the hematopoiesis process using the 3D-culture system in future research in chickens. MSCs’ several advantages, including ready availability, strong proliferation, and immune modulatory properties make them a suitable model in the field of stem cell research. This review summarizes current knowledge about the general characterization of MSCs and their application in chicken as a model organism.","Svoradova, Andrea; Zmrhal, Vladimir; Venusova, Eva; Slama, Petr",Animals (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34202772/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ani11071883,273

686201,Fostering Well-Being in the Elderly: Translating Theories on Positive Aging to Practical Approaches,2021-04-09,"Sepsis is the leading cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) and leads to increased morbidity and mortality in intensive care units. Current treatments for septic AKI are largely supportive and are not targeted towards its pathophysiology. Sepsis is commonly characterized by systemic inflammation and increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), particularly superoxide. Concomitantly released nitric oxide (NO) then reacts with superoxide, leading to the formation of reactive nitrogen species (RNS), predominantly peroxynitrite. Sepsis-induced ROS and RNS can reduce the bioavailability of NO, mediating renal microcirculatory abnormalities, localized tissue hypoxia and mitochondrial dysfunction, thereby initiating a propagating cycle of cellular injury culminating in AKI. In this review, we discuss the various sources of ROS during sepsis and their pathophysiological interactions with the immune system, microcirculation and mitochondria that can lead to the development of AKI. We also discuss the therapeutic utility of N-acetylcysteine and potential reasons for its efficacy in animal models of sepsis, and its inefficacy in ameliorating oxidative stress-induced organ dysfunction in human sepsis. Finally, we review the pre-clinical studies examining the antioxidant and pleiotropic actions of vitamin C that may be of benefit for mitigating septic AKI, including future implications for clinical sepsis.","Ow, Connie P.
