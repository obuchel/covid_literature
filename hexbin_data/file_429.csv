3970,Introducing a New Algorithm for Classification of Etiology in Studies on Pediatric Pneumonia: Protocol for the Trial of Respiratory Infections in Children for Enhanced Diagnostics Study,2019-04-26,"BACKGROUND: There is a need to better distinguish viral infections from antibiotic-requiring bacterial infections in children presenting with clinical community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) to assist health care workers in decision making and to improve the rational use of antibiotics. OBJECTIVE: The overall aim of the Trial of Respiratory infections in children for ENhanced Diagnostics (TREND) study is to improve the differential diagnosis of bacterial and viral etiologies in children aged below 5 years with clinical CAP, by evaluating myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA) as a biomarker for viral CAP and by evaluating an existing (multianalyte point-of-care antigen detection test system [mariPOC respi] ArcDia International Oy Ltd.) and a potential future point-of-care test for respiratory pathogens. METHODS: Children aged 1 to 59 months with clinical CAP as well as healthy, hospital-based, asymptomatic controls will be included at a pediatric emergency hospital in Stockholm, Sweden. Blood (analyzed for MxA and C-reactive protein) and nasopharyngeal samples (analyzed with real-time polymerase chain reaction as the gold standard and antigen-based mariPOC respi test as well as saved for future analyses of a novel recombinase polymerase amplification–based point-of-care test for respiratory pathogens) will be collected. A newly developed algorithm for the classification of CAP etiology will be used as the reference standard. RESULTS: A pilot study was performed from June to August 2017. The enrollment of study subjects started in November 2017. Results are expected by the end of 2019. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from the TREND study can be an important step to improve the management of children with clinical CAP.

A 433 base pair cDNA probe for the viral RNA encoding the nucleocapsid proteins of a Korean PRRSV isolate was generated by the polymerase chain reaction. All seven piglets infected with PRRSV showed a distinct, positive signal, scattered throughout the alveolar septa and spaces. Positive cells typically exhibited dark brown staining deposits in the cytoplasm without background staining. In-situ hybridization demonstrated that PRRSV replicated primarily in interstitial and alveolar macrophages, and occasionally in type 2 pneumocytes. The bronchial or bronchiolar epithelium did not exhibit a hybridization signal for PRRSV nucleic acids. The anterior and middle lobes of the lung were more reliable than the caudal or accessory lobes for the detection of PRRSV nucleic acids. The in-situ hybridization technique used was rapid, specific and sensitive, and may prove useful for the diagnosis of PRRSV infection in routinely fixed and processed tissues.","Cheon, D.-S.; Chae, C.; Lee, Y.-S.",J Comp Pathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130319/,429

We investigated T-cell replete haploidentical HSCT with post-transplantation cyclophosphamide following serotherapy-based, radiation-free, reduced intensity conditioning in children with non-malignant disorders who had rejected their primary graft. Twelve patients with primary or secondary graft failure received T-cell replete bone marrow grafts from haploidentical donors and post-transplantation cyclophosphamide. The recommended conditioning regimen comprised rituximab 375 mg/m(2), alemtuzumab 0.4 mg/kg, fludarabine 150 mg/m(2), treosulfan 20–24 g/m(2) and cyclophosphamide 29 mg/kg. After a median follow-up of 26 months (7–95), eleven of twelve patients (92%) are alive and well with complete donor chimerism in ten. Neutrophil and platelet engraftment were observed in all patients after a median of 18 days (15–61) and 39 days (15–191), respectively. Acute GVHD grade I was observed in 1/12 patients (8%) and mild chronic GVHD in 1/12 patients (8%). Viral reactivations and disease were frequent complications at 75% and 42%, respectively, but no death from infectious causes occurred. In summary, this retrospective analysis demonstrates that a post-transplantation cyclophosphamide-based HLA-haploidentical salvage HSCT after irradiation-free conditioning results in excellent engraftment and overall survival in children with non-malignant diseases.","Albert, Michael H.; Sirin, Mehtap; Hoenig, Manfred; Hauck, Fabian; Schuetz, Catharina; Bhattacharyya, Rajat; Stepensky, Polina; Jacoby, Elad; Güngör, Tayfun; Beier, Rita; Schulz, Ansgar",Bone Marrow Transplant,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8106764/,429

Isolation and identification of the virus showed that the pathogen causing this disease was a novel coronavirus. On January 12, 2020, the World Health Organization named the novel coronavirus causing the outbreak 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The disease caused by the virus was named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Later, the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses formally named this virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus shows strong infectivity and high lethality, arousing widespread concern. As an emerging virus, a comprehensive understanding of SARS-CoV-2 is missing. To provide a reference and a theoretical basis for further study of SARS-CoV-2, recent advances in our understanding of the virus are summarized in this review.","Xue, Ling; Li, Jiao; Wei, Lin; Ma, Cuiqing",J Int Med Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7488894/,429
46600,Personal Protective Equipment,2021-03-08,"In modern medicine, the oral cavity has often been viewed as a passive conduit to the upper airways and gastrointestinal tract; however, its connection to the rest of the body has been increasingly explored over the last 40 years. For several diseases, the periodontium and gingiva are at the center of this oral-systemic link. Over 50 systemic conditions have been specifically associated with gingival and periodontal inflammation, including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), which have recently been elevated from simple “associations” to elegant, mechanistic investigations. IBD and periodontitis have been reported to impact each other’s progression via a bidirectional relationship whereby chronic oral or intestinal inflammation can impact the other; however, the precise mechanisms for how this occurs remain unclear. Classically, the etiology of gingival inflammation (gingivitis) is oral microbial dysbiosis in the subgingival crevice that can lead to destructive periodontal disease (periodontitis); however, the current understanding of gingival involvement in IBD is that it may represent a separate disease entity from classical gingivitis, arising from mechanisms related to systemic inflammatory activation of niche-resident immune cells. Synthesizing available evidence, we hypothesize that once established, IBD can be driven by microbiomial and inflammatory changes originating specifically from the gingival niche through saliva, thereby worsening IBD outcomes and thus perpetuating a vicious cycle. In this review, we introduce the concept of the “gum–gut axis” as a framework for examining this reciprocal relationship between the periodontium and the gastrointestinal tract. To support and explore this gum–gut axis, we 1) provide a narrative review of historical studies reporting gingival and periodontal manifestations in IBD, 2) describe the current understanding and advances for the gum–gut axis, and 3) underscore the importance of collaborative treatment and research plans between oral and GI practitioners to benefit this patient population.","Byrd, Kevin M.; Gulati, Ajay S.",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7933581/,429
53321,"908 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Guidance During A Global Pandemic: A Statistical Analysis of National Perceived Confidence, Knowledge, And Educational Deficits Amongst U.K. Based Doctors",2021-05-04,"Background/Aims COVID-19 has had significant impacts upon the delivery of rheumatology care in the UK. To date, there is little data specifically addressing how care has been disrupted and the impact upon patient attitudes and beliefs. Herein, we describe the results of a national study investigating how COVID-19 has; (1) reduced access to services; (2) altered treatment and drug monitoring; (3) impacted on clinic follow-up; (4) changed patient beliefs regarding ongoing/future care. Methods We conducted an online survey of patients attending rheumatology clinics in the UK. Questions were developed by clinicians with input from patient charities and four expert patients. The survey was hosted online between 8 September and 8 October 2020. Results In total, 2,054 patients completed the survey and the average number of rheumatic conditions each patient reported was 1.98±1.38 with the most common being; rheumatoid arthritis (48%), lupus (20%), Sjogren’s syndrome (19%), fibromyalgia (15%) and vasculitis (8%). More than half (57%) were told to shield, whilst 10% decided to shield of their own accord. Compared with before the pandemic, 57% felt it was difficult/very difficult to contact their rheumatologist. Regarding treatment, 15% reported difficulty obtaining their usual medication. Less than half (45%) of patients continued medication as previously and had no problem accessing it, although 21% said their usual drug monitoring had been discontinued. Overall, 3% stopped their treatment of their own accord. In all, 26% said their appointments in rheumatology clinics had been cancelled and they did not know when they would be seen again (4% reported no change in their outpatient follow-up). Prior to the pandemic, 13% of patients had received a telephone consultation, however, since the pandemic 60% had received one. Just 19% felt it was easy to be honest with their clinician via telephone. Only 33% were satisfied with the current level of care, 43% reported their rheumatology care was worse than pre-pandemic and 38% of patients felt they needed to see their rheumatologist but could not get an appointment. Over half (57%) of patients expressed worries about their future care. If offered an appointment in the next few months 66% said they would prefer it be face-to-face. Conclusion To our knowledge, this study is the largest survey of patient experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic under rheumatological care anywhere in the world. We found more than half of patients were told to shield and one-in-ten decided to shield without being directly told to do so. Less than half of patients maintained relatively good access to their usual medication without necessary monitoring in many cases. In particular, patients express high levels of concern about their future care. These high levels of disruption indicate the importance of maintaining routine rheumatology services during the ongoing pandemic. Disclosure C.

62674,Patient experiences with telehealth in sleep medicine: a qualitative evaluation.,2021-03-23,"OBJECTIVES The success of longitudinal sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is perceived as being potentially limited by dilatation of the remaining gastric tube during the follow-up. The aim of this prospective study was to determine the incidence and the characteristics of sleeve dilatation during the first post-operative year. MATERIALS AND METHODS Gastric volumetry using 3D gastric computed tomography with gas expansion was performed in 54 successive subjects who underwent an LSG for morbid obesity at 3 and 12 months following surgery. Total gastric volume, volume of the gastric tube and the antrum, and diameter of the gastric tube were assessed after multiplanar reconstructions. An increase of at least 25 % of the total gastric volume was considered as sleeve dilatation. Percentage of excess BMI loss (%EBMIL) and daily caloric intakes were recorded during the first 18 months. RESULTS Sixty-one percent of the subjects experienced sleeve dilatation 1 year after surgery. The gastric tube was mainly involved in the sleeve dilatation process (+91 %). Sleeve dilatation occurred especially in subjects with smaller total gastric volume at baseline (189 vs 236 ml, p = 0.02). Daily caloric intake was similar between the groups at each point of the follow-up. No difference concerning %EBMIL was observed between the groups during the 18 months of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Sleeve dilatation occurred in more than 50 % of the patients. Dilatation was not necessarily linked to an increase of daily caloric intake and insufficient weight loss during the first 18 months following surgery. Small LSG at baseline is at higher risk of dilatation.","Disse, Emmanuel; Pasquer, Arnaud; Pelascini, Elise; Valette, Pierre-Jean; Betry, Cecile; Laville, Martine; Gouillat, Christian; Robert, Maud",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-016-2261-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27334645/,429

65176,Inclusive research and social determinants of health: two critical concepts at the forefront of furthering our understanding of COVID-19's impact on sleep and resilience.,2020-12-07,"AIM Endometriosis is one of the most common gynecological diseases diagnosed in almost 70% of patients with chronic pelvic pain (CPP). However, a quarter of women with pelvic pain is diagnosed with external genital endometriosis (EGE) during laparoscopy. A special group is represented by patients with PP that did not stop after the removal of endometrial foci. The mechanisms of the pathogenesis of the formation of pain syndrome are not completely explored yet. According to several authors, a significant role in the pathogenesis of pelvic pain recurrence after surgical treatment of EGE is played by active neuroangiogenesis, both in ectopic and eutopic endometrium. The aim of the study was to expand the understanding of the pathogenesis of pelvic pain that did not stop (recurrence) after surgical treatment of external genital endometriosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study involved 2 stages. At the first stage (algological), data from B&B, NRS and VRS algological questionnaires, which were completed by patients with recurrent PP after surgical treatment of EGE, were analyzed (n = 130, aged 18-45 years old, average age 32.5 ± 7.6 years). All women were operated on for EGE no later than 3-6 months after assessing the patients by the algological questionnaires; they did not receive drug therapy after surgical treatment and sought medical attention for recurrent pelvic pain. Materials for the study of the endometrium were obtained by the pipelle biopsymethod. The control group was formed from a number of women with EGE without PP, who applied for surgical treatment of infertility (n = 30). RESULTS The results of the study have shown that the basis of pathogenesis of pelvic pain recurrence in patients who did not receive medical therapy after surgical treatment of EGE is the activation of neuro-angiogenesis processes and reduction of apoptosis. The results show a statistically significant 1.6 times increasing expression of NGF in eutopic endometrium (57.9 ± 2.5 vs 35.3 ± 2.1% of patients with the silent form of the gene and its receptor NTRK1 1.8 times (2.78 ± 0.25 versus 1.56 ± 0.21.e. respectively). Conclusion: The pathogenesis of pelvic pain in patients who did not receive medical therapy after surgical treatment of endometriosis compared to no pain form of the disease is the activation of the processes of neurogenesis in the eutopic endometrium.","Radzinsky, Victor; Orazov, Mekan; Sharapova, Olga; Khamoshina, Marina",Gynecological endocrinology : the official journal of the International Society of Gynecological Endocrinology,https://doi.org/10.1080/09513590.2020.1816721; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33305663/,429
69737,Using interactive computer simulation for teaching the proper use of personal protective equipment.,2015,"Antidepressants are widely prescribed, but their efficacy relative to placebo is modest, in part because the clinical diagnosis of major depression encompasses biologically heterogeneous conditions. Here, we sought to identify a neurobiological signature of response to antidepressant treatment as compared to placebo. We designed a latent-space machine-learning algorithm tailored for resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) and applied it to data from the largest imaging-coupled, placebo-controlled antidepressant study (n = 309). Symptom improvement was robustly predicted in a manner both specific for the antidepressant sertraline (versus placebo) and generalizable across different study sites and EEG equipment. This sertraline-predictive EEG signature generalized to two depression samples, wherein it reflected general antidepressant medication responsivity and related differentially to a repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment outcome. Furthermore, we found that the sertraline resting-state EEG signature indexed prefrontal neural responsivity, as measured by concurrent transcranial magnetic stimulation and EEG. Our findings advance the neurobiological understanding of antidepressant treatment through an EEG-tailored computational model and provide a clinical avenue for personalized treatment of depression.","Wu, Wei; Zhang, Yu; Jiang, Jing; Lucas, Molly V; Fonzo, Gregory A; Rolle, Camarin E; Cooper, Crystal; Chin-Fatt, Cherise; Krepel, Noralie; Cornelssen, Carena A; Wright, Rachael; Toll, Russell T; Trivedi, Hersh M; Monuszko, Karen; Caudle, Trevor L; Sarhadi, Kamron; Jha, Manish K; Trombello, Joseph M; Deckersbach, Thilo; Adams, Phil; McGrath, Patrick J; Weissman, Myrna M; Fava, Maurizio; Pizzagalli, Diego A; Arns, Martijn; Trivedi, Madhukar H; Etkin, Amit",Nature biotechnology,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-019-0397-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32042166/,429

MATERIALS AND METHODS Sixty-four cuboid liver specimens were ablated with four commercially available RFA systems (Radionics Cool-tip, AngioDynamic 1500X, Boston Scientific RF 3000, Celon CelonPower LAB): 16 specimens for each system; eight for 3 cm, and eight for 5 cm. Ablation diameters were measured, volumes were calculated, and RFA times were recorded. RESULTS For the 3 cm target ablation volume, all tested RFA systems exceeded the mathematically calculated volume of 14.14 cm3. For the 3 cm target ablation volume, mean ablation volume and mean ablation time for each RFA system were as follows: 28.5 ± 6.5 cm3, 12.0 ± 0.0 min for Radionics Cool-tip; 17.1 ± 4.9 cm3, 9.36 ± 0.63 min for AngioDynamic 1500X; 29.7 ± 11.7 cm3, 4.60 ± 0.50 min for Boston Scientific RF 3000; and 28.8 ± 7.0 cm3, 20.85 ± 0.86 min for Celon CelonPower LAB. For the 5 cm target ablation volume, Radionics Cool-tip (48.3 ± 9.9 cm3, 12.0 ± 0.0 min) and AngioDynamic 1500X (39.4 ± 16.2 cm3, 19.59 ± 1.13 min) did not reach the mathematically calculated target ablation volume (65.45 cm3), whereas Boston Scientific RF 3000 (71.8 ± 14.5 cm3, 9.15 ± 2.93 min) and Celon CelonPower LAB (93.9 ± 28.1 cm3, 40.21 ± 1.78 min) exceeded it. CONCLUSION While all systems reached the 3 cm target ablation volume, results were variable for the 5 cm target ablation volume. Only Boston Scientific RF 3000 and Celon CelonPower LAB created volumes above the target, whereas Radionics Cool-tip and AngioDynamic 1500X remained below the target volume. For the 3 cm target ablation volume, AngioDynamic 1500X with 21% deviation was closest to the target volume. For the 5 cm target volume Boston Scientific RF 3000 with 10% deviation was closest.","Rathke, Hendrik; Hamm, Bernd; Güttler, Felix; Rathke, Joern; Rump, Jens; Teichgräber, Ulf; de Bucourt, Maximilian",Diagnostic and interventional radiology,https://doi.org/10.5152/dir.2013.13157; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24509185/,429

81622,AASM takes the pulse of the sleep field and responds to COVID-19.,2020-09-28,"BACKGROUND The development of low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS) after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) occurs in up to 25% of neonates and is associated with increased morbidity. Invasive cardiac output monitors such as pulmonary artery catheters have limited availability and are costly. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a noninvasive tool for monitoring regional oxygenation in neonates in the cardiac intensive care unit (CICU). We hypothesize that anterior abdominal NIRS may aid in the early identification of LCOS after cardiac surgery. METHODS Prospective observational study from October 2013 to October 2014 of all neonates with congenital heart disease admitted to the CICU following CPB. Abdominal NIRS values were continuously recorded upon CICU admission and for the subsequent 24-hour period. The primary outcome was the development of LCOS. Low cardiac output syndrome was defined as the presence of metabolic lactic acidosis (pH < 7.3 and lactate > 4) or addition of a new vasoactive agent or a vasoactive inotropic score > 15. Autoregressive time series models were constructed for each patient based on the continuously recorded NIRS values, and patients were stratified by development of LCOS. RESULTS Twenty-seven neonates met inclusion criteria, of whom 11 developed LCOS. Neonates who developed LCOS had lower constant NIRS values (49% vs. 66%, P < .001). Constant NIRS values less than 58% best predicted development of LCOS with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 69%. CONCLUSION Lower constant anterior abdominal NIRS values in the early postoperative period may allow early identification of neonates at risk for LCOS.","Hickok, Rhiannon L; Spaeder, Michael C; Berger, John T; Schuette, Jennifer J; Klugman, Darren",World journal for pediatric & congenital heart surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/2150135115618939; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26957401/,429
83743,"Avoiding Therapeutic Nihilism from Complex Geriatric Intervention ""Negative"" Trials: STRIDE Lessons.",2020-10-20,"BACKGROUND There are profound individual differences in clinical outcomes between colorectal cancers (CRCs) presenting with identical stage of disease. Molecular stratification, in conjunction with the traditional TNM staging, is a promising way to predict patient outcomes. We investigated the interconnectivity between tumor stage and tumor biology reflected by the Consensus Molecular Subtypes (CMSs) in CRC, and explored the possible value of these insights in patients with stage II colon cancer. METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis using clinical records and gene expression profiling in a meta-cohort of 1040 CRC patients. The interconnectivity of tumor biology and disease stage was assessed by investigating the association between CMSs and TNM classification. In order to validate the clinical applicability of our findings we employed a meta-cohort of 197 stage II colon cancers. RESULTS CMS4 was significantly more prevalent in advanced stages of disease (stage I 9.8% versus stage IV 38.5%, p < 0.001). The observed differential gene expression between cancer stages is at least partly explained by the biological differences as reflected by CMS subtypes. Gene signatures for stage III-IV and CMS4 were highly correlated (r = 0.77, p < 0.001). CMS4 cancers showed an increased progression rate to more advanced stages (CMS4 compared to CMS2: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.08-1.46). Patients with a CMS4 cancer had worse survival in the high-risk stage II tumors compared to the total stage II cohort (5-year DFS 41.7% versus 100.0%, p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS Considerable interconnectivity between tumor biology and tumor stage in CRC exists.

84095,Critical Supply Shortages - The Need for Ventilators and Personal Protective Equipment during the Covid-19 Pandemic.,2020-03-25,"The actin cytoskeleton drives cell motility and is essential for neuronal development and function. LIM and SH3 Protein 1 (LASP1) is a unique actin-binding protein that is expressed in a wide range of cells including neurons, but its roles in cellular motility and neuronal development are not well understood. We report that LASP1 is expressed in rat hippocampus early in development, and this expression is maintained through adulthood. High-resolution imaging reveals that LASP1 is selectively concentrated at the leading edge of lamellipodia in migrating cells and axonal growth cones. This local enrichment of LASP1 is dynamically associated with the protrusive activity of lamellipodia, depends on the barbed ends of actin filaments, and requires both the LIM domain and nebulin repeats of LASP1. Knockdown of LASP1 in cultured rat hippocampal neurons results in a substantial reduction in axonal outgrowth and arborization. Finally, loss of the Drosophila homolog Lasp from a subset of commissural neurons in the developing ventral nerve cord produces defasciculated axon bundles that do not reach their targets. Together, our data support a novel role for LASP1 in actin-based lamellipodial protrusion and establish LASP1 as a positive regulator of both in vitro and in vivo axon development.

In addition to standard and advanced monitors typically used during cardiac surgery, anesthesiologists may consider monitoring the brain with raw or processed electroencephalography (EEG). There is strong evidence that a protocol incorporating the processed EEG bispectral index (BIS) decreases the incidence intraoperative awareness in comparison with standard practice. However, there is conflicting evidence that incorporating the BIS into cardiac anesthesia practice improves ""fast-tracking,"" decreases anesthetic drug use, or detects cerebral ischemia. Recent research, including many cardiac surgical patients, shows that a protocol based on BIS monitoring is not superior to a protocol based on end-tidal anesthetic concentration monitoring in preventing awareness. There has been a resurgence of interest in the anesthesia literature in limited montage EEG monitoring, including nonproprietary processed indices. This has been accompanied by research showing that with structured training, anesthesiologists can glean useful information from the raw EEG trace. In this review, we discuss both the hypothesized benefits and limitations of BIS and frontal channel EEG monitoring in the cardiac surgical population.","Kertai, Miklos D; Whitlock, Elizabeth L; Avidan, Michael S",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0b013e31823ee030; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22253267/,429

OBJECTIVE We have screened phytocompounds from a medicinal herb, Tinospora cordifolia, for their capacities to interrupt the viral RBD and host ACE2 interactions. METHOD We employed molecular docking to screen phytocompounds in T. cordifolia against the ACE2-RBD complex, performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and estimated the electrostatic component of binding free energy. RESULTS 'Tinocordiside' docked very well at the center of the interface of ACE2-RBD complex, and was found to be well stabilized during MD simulation. Tinocordiside incorporation significantly decreased electrostatic component of binding free energies of ACE2-RBD complex (23.5 and 17.10 kcal/mol in the trajectories without or with the ligand, respectively). As the basal rate constant of protein association is in the order of 5, (105 to 106 M-1 S-1 ), there might be no big conformational change or loop reorganization, but involves only local conformational change typically observed in diffusion-controlled association. Taken together, the increase in global flexibility of the complex, clearly indicates the start of unbinding process of the complex. CONCLUSION It indicates that such an interruption of electrostatic interactions between the RBD and ACE2, and the increase in global flexibility of the complex, would weaken or block SARS-CoV-2 entry and its subsequent infectivity. We postulate that natural phytochemicals like Tinocordiside could be the viable options for controlling SARS-CoV-2 contagion and its entry into host cells.","Balkrishna, Acharya; Pokhrel, Subarna; Varshney, Anurag",Combinatorial chemistry & high throughput screening,https://doi.org/10.2174/1386207323666201110152615; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33172372/,429

Given the heterogeneity of patients from ethnic minorities, established strategies for patient centredness might not work in their case. The concept of coproduction provides a new perspective on how to collaboratively create the highest possible value for both the patient and the healthcare system. The concept acknowledges that all service is coproduced and directs attention to the relationship between patient and care provider. Coproduction is still a new concept in healthcare and its use with vulnerable groups of patients requires further study. This protocol outlines a scoping review to be conducted on the current knowledge on coproduction of service by immigrants and their service providers in the healthcare sector. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will use Joanna Briggs methodology for scoping reviews. The data will stem from the following databases: PubMed, Scopus, Ovid EMBASE, EBSCO CINAHL, EBSCO PsycINFO, Cochrane Library and Web of Science. We will also screen the websites of national authorities and research organisations for publications and review the literature lists of the identified articles for relevant references. We will include all types of literature on coproduction of healthcare or social service by immigrants and service providers, including their relationship with one another, communication and collaboration. Two reviewers will independently screen eligible publications and extract data using a checklist developed for this scoping review. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The results of the study will provide an innovative perspective on the coproduction of value in healthcare service by immigrant patients and care providers.

100711,Is There an Ethical Mandate to Practice Without Proper Personal Protective Equipment?,2021-02-05,"BACKGROUND Nosocomial outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can have devastating consequences from both a resource cost and patient healthcare perspective. Relying on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for identifying infected individuals may result in missed cases. Screening for antibodies after an outbreak can help to find missed cases and better illuminate routes of transmission. METHODS In this study, we present the results of a serological screening of the healthcare workers (HCWs) on a ward for infectious diseases in Sweden with a point-of-care antibody test 8 weeks after an outbreak of COVID-19. In all, 107/123 (87%) of HCWs who were tested with RT-PCR in the outbreak investigation participated in this study on seroprevalence. Participants were also asked to fill out a questionnaire entailing epidemiological data. The cohort was stratified by RT-PCR result and the resulting groups were compared to each other. RESULTS Six (8%) HCWs who were tested RT-PCR negative during the outbreak investigation had developed specific IgG antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). These HCWs had all worked shifts with colleagues who later were tested RT-PCR positive during the outbreak. CONCLUSIONS Our results indicate that a serological follow-up screening after an outbreak may be used as a complement to virus detection in an outbreak situation. However, immunoglobulin (Ig) G-detection should also be performed at the start of an outbreak, to facilitate interpretation of the results.","Strand, Rasmus; Fernström, Nils; Holmberg, Anna; De Marinis, Yang; Fraenkel, Carl-Johan; Rasmussen, Magnus",Infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1080/23744235.2021.1925739; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33974498/,429
102865,Advanced infection control for your practice.,2021-04-01,"Staying home and avoiding unnecessary contact is an important part of the effort to contain COVID-19 and limit deaths. Every state in the United States enacted policies to encourage distancing and some mandated staying home. Understanding how these policies interact with individuals' voluntary responses to the COVID-19 epidemic is a critical initial step in understanding the role of these nonpharmaceutical interventions in transmission dynamics and assessing policy impacts. We use variation in policy responses along with smart device data that measures the amount of time Americans stayed home to disentangle the extent that observed shifts in staying home behavior are induced by policy. We find evidence that stay-at-home orders and voluntary response to locally reported COVID-19 cases and deaths led to behavioral change. For the median county, which implemented a stay-at-home order with about two cases, we find that the response to stay-at-home orders increased time at home as if the county had experienced 29 additional local cases. However, the relative effect of stay-at-home orders was much greater in select counties. On the one hand, the mandate can be viewed as displacing a voluntary response to this rise in cases. On the other hand, policy accelerated the response, which likely helped reduce spread in the early phase of the pandemic. It is important to be able to attribute the relative role of self-interested behavior or policy mandates to understand the limits and opportunities for relying on voluntary behavior as opposed to imposing stay-at-home orders.","Yan, Youpei; Malik, Amyn A; Bayham, Jude; Fenichel, Eli P; Couzens, Chandra; Omer, Saad B",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2008814118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33820846/,429

These unpredictable and sometimes devastating events tax already stretched health care systems. The goal of this process paper is to share the experience of a pharmacy school in the development and implementation of a sustainable emergency preparedness and response support network (EPRSN) using an established student government infrastructure to support information sharing among community pharmacies, state emergency response teams, and community members. Observations There are more than 140 accredited pharmacy schools/colleges across the United States, employing more than 6,500 pharmacy faculty members and teaching more than 63,000 student pharmacists. The majority of schools/colleges provide free and volunteer-based health care services and collaborate with local, regional, and national entities, such as state boards of pharmacy and national and state professional pharmacy organizations. Student pharmacists are positioned across the country with reach to rural and underserved communities and have student organizational structures in place to manage student volunteers and support health care service opportunities. To address gaps in emergency and preparedness response, pharmacy students assessed and operationalized steps to develop the EPRSN. Pharmacies were identified and contacted by student pharmacists. Student leaders created student organization flowcharts and call charts with up-to-date pharmacist contact information. Organizational structure for collecting, capturing, updating, and sharing pharmacy data with state emergency response teams was developed and trialed. Conclusions Student pharmacists represent a sustainable resource, uniquely positioned to identify community needs, support emergency efforts, coordinate with local pharmacies, and work with pharmacists and others to ensure that patients receive the care they need during pandemics and other emergencies.","Bogart, Talethia; Nguyen, Elaine; Owens, Christopher; Robinson, Renee","Federal practitioner : for the health care professionals of the VA, DoD, and PHS",https://doi.org/10.12788/fp.0108; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34177219/,429

Radionuclide targeting of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) with 111In-labeled capromab pendetide (ProstaScint) is a clinical option for prostate cancer staging. We propose the use of 124I-labeled capromab to decrease the retention of radioactivity in healthy organs (due to the non-residualizing properties of the radiolabel). The use of 124I as a label should increase imaging sensitivity due to the advantages of PET as an imaging modality. Capromab targets the intracellular domain of PSMA; accumulation of radioactivity in the tumor should not depend on internalization of the antigen/antibody complex. Capromab was iodinated, and its targeting properties were compared with indium labeled counterpart in LNCaP xenografts in dual isotope mode. PSMA-negative xenografts (PC3) were used as a negative control. Radioiodinated capromab bound to PSMA specifically. Biodistribution of 125I/111In-capromab showed a more rapid clearance of iodine radioactivity from liver, spleen, kidneys, bones, colon tissue, as well as tumors. Maximum tumor uptake (13±8% ID/g for iodine and 29±9% ID/g for indium) and tumor-to-non-tumor ratios for both agents were measured 5 days post-injection (pi). High tumor accumulation and low uptake of radioactivity in normal organs were confirmed using microPET/CT 5 days pi of 124I-capromab.","Tolmachev, Vladimir; Malmberg, Jennie; Estrada, Sergio; Eriksson, Olof; Orlova, Anna",International journal of oncology,https://doi.org/10.3892/ijo.2014.2376; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24718894/,429

SETTING A national survey was conducted by Qualtrics from August 24 to September 11, 2020. The state-level variables were constructed on data from multiple sources. SUBJECTS 2,440 respondents 18 years and older from all 50 states and D.C. MEASURES The outcome variable is the public response to COVID-19 measured by threat perception, behavioral adjustment, and policy support. The predictors include individual-level sociodemographic factors and state-level indicators about public health conditions, political context, and economic recovery. ANALYSIS Multilevel structural equation modeling is used for statistical estimation. RESULTS People from states with more COVID-19 cases (β = 0.020, p < 0.1), mandatory face mask policies (β = 0.069, p < 0.05), and liberal governments (β = 0.002, p < 0.05) are more likely to respond while people from states whose economies have recovered closer to the pre-pandemic level are less likely to do so (β = -0.005, p < 0.05). Regarding individual-level predictors, older people (β = 0.005, p < 0.001) and people with better education (β = 0.029, p < 0.01), leaning toward the Democrat Party (β = 0.066, p < 0.001) and liberal political ideology (β = 0.094, p < 0.001), and have stronger generalized trust (β = 0.033, p < 0.001) are more likely to respond than their counterparts.

During this step, blood loss and unintended injuries to the intrahepatic structures and hepatic remnant may occur. There is no evidence to prove the ideal techniques for hepatic parenchymal transection. The aim of this study is to compare the safety, efficacy, and outcome of clamp-crush technique versus harmonic scalpel as a method of parenchymal transection in living-donor hepatectomy. METHODS Consecutive living liver donors, undergoing right hemi-hepatectomy, during the period between May 2015 and April 2016, were included in this prospective randomized study. Cases were randomized into two groups; group (A) harmonic scalpel group and group (B) Clamp-crush group. RESULTS During the study period, 72 cases underwent right hemi-hepatectomy for adult living donor liver transplantation and were randomized into two groups. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups regarding preoperative demographic and radiological data. Longer operation time and hepatectomy duration were found in group B. There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding blood loss, blood loss during hepatectomy, and blood transfusion. More unexpected bleeding events occurred in group A. Higher necrosis at the cut margin of the liver parenchyma was noted in group A. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups regarding postoperative ICU stay, hospital stay, postoperative morbidities, and readmission rates. CONCLUSION Clamp-crush technique is advocated as a simple, easy, safe, and cheaper method for hepatic parenchymal transection in living donors.","Sultan, Ahmad Mohamed; Shehta, Ahmed; Salah, Tarek; Elshoubary, Mohamed; Elghawalby, Ahmed Nabieh; Said, Rami; Elmorshedi, Mohamed; Marwan, Ahmed; Shiha, Usama; Fathy, Omar; Wahab, Mohamed Abdel",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11605-019-04103-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671805/,429

We hypothesized that drugs selected from proteins related by their tertiary structure, rather than their primary structure, were likely to interact with TMPRSS2. We created a structure-based phylogenetic computational tool named 3DPhyloFold to systematically identify structurally similar serine proteases with known therapeutic inhibitors and demonstrated effective inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro and in vivo. Several candidate compounds, Avoralstat, PCI-27483, Antipain, and Soybean-Trypsin-Inhibitor, inhibited TMPRSS2 in biochemical and cell infection assays. Avoralstat, a clinically tested Kallikrein-related B1 inhibitor, inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication in human airway epithelial cells.

131389,The COVID-19 pandemic: reflections for the field of sleep medicine.,2020-05-20,"INTRODUCTION To achieve significant progress in global HIV prevention from 2020 onward, it is essential to ensure that appropriate programmes are being delivered with high quality and sufficient intensity and scale and then taken up by the people who most need and want them in order to have both individual and public health impact. Yet, currently, there is no standard way of assessing this. Available HIV prevention indicators do not provide a logical set of measures that combine to show reduction in HIV incidence and allow for comparison of success (or failure) of HIV prevention programmes and for monitoring progress in meeting global targets. To redress this, attention increasingly has turned to the prospects of devising an HIV prevention cascade, similar to the now-standard HIV treatment cascade; but this has proven to be a controversial enterprise, chiefly due to the complexity of primary prevention. DISCUSSION We address a number of core issues attendant with devising prevention cascades, including: determining the population of interest and accounting for the variability and fluidity of HIV-related risk within it; the fact that there are multiple HIV prevention methods, and many people are exposed to a package of them, rather than a single method; and choosing the final step (outcome) in the cascade. We propose two unifying models of prevention cascades-one more appropriate for programme managers and monitors and the other for researchers and programme developers-and note their relationship. We also provide some considerations related to cascade data quality and improvement. CONCLUSIONS The HIV prevention field has been grappling for years with the idea of developing a standardised way to regularly assess progress and to monitor and improve programmes accordingly. The cascade provides the potential to do this, but it is complicated and highly nuanced. We believe the two models proposed here reflect emerging consensus among the range of stakeholders who have been engaging in this discussion and who are dedicated to achieving global HIV prevention goals by ensuring the most appropriate and effective programmes and methods are supported.","Auerbach, Judith D; Gerritsen, Annette Am; Dallabetta, Gina; Morrison, Michelle; Garnett, Geoffrey P",Journal of the International AIDS Society,https://doi.org/10.1002/jia2.25498; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32602653/,429

OBJECTIVE To evaluate perineogenital pain intensity and quality as well as short-term complications after BMGU, and to describe the impact of pain and complications on stricture recurrence. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial including 135 patients, who underwent BMGU from 2014 to 2015, was performed. INTERVENTION One-stage BMGU. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Patient-reported perineogenital pain was assessed by the Numeric Pain Rating Scale and the Short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire preoperatively and at 1, 5, and 21 d, and 3, 6, and 12 mo postoperatively. Complications were assessed by the Clavien-Dindo classification and the Comprehensive Complication Index. Pain and complications were compared according to stricture recurrence. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS At a mean follow-up of 21±15 mo, 29 patients (21%) had stricture recurrence. Pain intensity as well as sensory and affective pain quality decreased over time, reaching a minimum at 6 mo. Postoperative complications at days 5 (95% of patients) and 21 (27% of patients) were predominantly ""minor"" (Clavien-Dindo classification grade≤IIIa). Neither patient-reported perineogenital pain nor cumulative morbidity burden was different between patients with and those without stricture recurrence (all p ≥ 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Perineogenital pain is frequent after BMGU, but pain intensity and quality decrease over time. The same holds true for postoperative complications, which are frequent but mostly present as minor events. Current findings allow for thorough preoperative patient counseling regarding the expected perineogenital pain intensity and quality over time as well as complications following BMGU. PATIENT SUMMARY In this study, we looked at pain intensity and pain quality as well as complications following buccal mucosal graft urethroplasty. We found that pain in the perineogenital region is frequent, but pain intensity and quality decrease over time. Similarly, postoperative complications are frequent, but mainly present as minor events.","Fuehner, Constantin; Vetterlein, Malte W; Lesske, Judith; Rink, Michael; Riechardt, Silke; König, Frederik; Gild, Philipp; Pinnschmidt, Hans O; Meyer, Christian P; Ludwig, Tim A; Engel, Oliver; Fisch, Margit; Dahlem, Roland; Soave, Armin",European urology focus,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euf.2020.09.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069623/,429
137685,Empirical derivation and validation of a wandering typology.,2009,"Over the past few decades, advances in pharmacological, catheter-based, and surgical reperfusion have improved outcomes for patients with acute myocardial infarctions. However, patients with large infarcts or those who do not receive timely revascularization remain at risk for mechanical complications of acute myocardial infarction. The most commonly encountered mechanical complications are acute mitral regurgitation secondary to papillary muscle rupture, ventricular septal defect, pseudoaneurysm, and free wall rupture; each complication is associated with a significant risk of morbidity, mortality, and hospital resource utilization. The care for patients with mechanical complications is complex and requires a multidisciplinary collaboration for prompt recognition, diagnosis, hemodynamic stabilization, and decision support to assist patients and families in the selection of definitive therapies or palliation. However, because of the relatively small number of high-quality studies that exist to guide clinical practice, there is significant variability in care that mainly depends on local expertise and available resources.","Damluji, Abdulla A; van Diepen, Sean; Katz, Jason N; Menon, Venu; Tamis-Holland, Jacqueline E; Bakitas, Marie; Cohen, Mauricio G; Balsam, Leora B; Chikwe, Joanna",Circulation,https://doi.org/10.1161/cir.0000000000000985; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34126755/,429

Methods Hundred and forty-one consecutive patients underwent surgery for acute type A aortic dissection at our institution from 2010 to 2016. Of those, 104 patients underwent ascending aorta and hemiarch repair under hypothermic circulatory arrest with antegrade cerebral perfusion (standard group). Since 2013, 37 patients have undergone the standard procedure combined with antegrade stent implantation in the descending aorta (stented group). A matched analysis using the logistic EuroSCORE (37 patients per group) was done. All data were collected prospectively. Results The mean logistic EuroSCORE was 29 in both groups, P = 1. Cardiopulmonary bypass time was 150 ± 57 (standard) vs 157 ± 48 (stented) min, P = 0.6; aortic clamping 99 ± 47 (standard) vs 100 ± 36 (stented) min, P = 1. Stented patients had longer circulatory arrest times with antegrade cerebral perfusion, 23 ± 7 vs 15 ± 7 min, P < 0.001. Stroke occurred in 24.3% (standard) vs 8.1% (stented), P = 0.1; paraplegia developed in 2.7% (standard) vs 0% (stented), P = 1. Abdominal intervention due to suspected visceral ischaemia was needed in 18.9% (standard) vs 5.4% (stented), P = 0.2. 30-day mortality was 13.5% (standard) vs 0% (stented), P = 0.05. Survival at 6-month was 100% and 86.5% in patients with implanted stents and standard repair, respectively, P = 0.02. Conclusions Antegrade, open stent graft implantation into the descending aorta during acute type A aortic dissection repair is safe and is associated with improved outcomes at 6 months postoperatively compared to the standard repair technique.","Matt, Peter; Banerjee, Prerana; Grapow, Martin; Rueter, Florian; Schurr, Ulrich; Siegemund, Martin; Fassl, Jens; Reuthebuch, Oliver; Eckstein, Friedrich",European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1093/ejcts/ezw412; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28062548/,429
142785,"Before classifying exacerbation in myasthenia as crisis, comprehensive work-up is warranted.",2021-01-05,"Electron cryomicrographs of intact parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) virions revealed two different surface structures, namely, a continuous layer and distinct individual spikes. The structure of these spikes reconstructed from intact virions was compared with known F ectodomain structures and was found to be different from the prefusion PIV5 F0 structure but, surprisingly, very similar to the human PIV3 F postfusion structure. Hence, we conclude that the individual F1+F2 spikes in intact PIV5 virions also correspond to the postfusion state. Since the observed fusion activity of PIV5 virions has to be associated with prefusion F1+F2 proteins, they have necessarily to be localized in the continuous surface structure. The data therefore strongly suggest that the prefusion state of the F1+F2 protein requires stabilization, most probably by the association with hemagglutinin-neuraminidase. The conversion of F1+F2 proteins from the prefusion toward the postfusion state while embedded in the virus membrane is topologically difficult to comprehend on the basis of established models and demands reconsideration of our current understanding.","Ludwig, Kai; Schade, Boris; Böttcher, Christoph; Korte, Thomas; Ohlwein, Nina; Baljinnyam, Bolormaa; Veit, Michael; Herrmann, Andreas",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02154-07; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18216117/,429
143249,Reliability and validity of PSQI among frontline health care workers of COVID-19 using classical test theory and item response theory.,2021-09-17,"STUDY DESIGN This was a controlled, interventional animal study. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to investigate the thermal injury of nerve root by cauterization near the nerve root and to identify the prevention or rescue procedure of nerve root injury. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA In spine surgery, bipolar cauterization of epidural venous plexus near the nerve root is an essential procedure to control bleeding. Although a potential risk of neurological thermal damage exists, the underlying mechanism and prevention have not been elucidated. METHODS Temperature measurement and histological evaluation after bipolar cauterization near the posterior branch of the nerve root were performed using a rabbit model. Subsequently, the effect of saline irrigation or changing the direction of bipolar forceps to reduce thermal elevation during bipolar cauterization was evaluated. Finally, the effectiveness of locally injected corticosteroid after bipolar cauterization was evaluated. RESULTS After bipolar cauterization, temperature of the surrounding site reached 60.9 °C, and 47.8% of the nerves were histologically injured. Using saline irrigation, thermal elevation was significantly suppressed up to 42.7 °C (P < 0.01), and no nerve was histologically injured. When bipolar cauterization was performed in the perpendicular direction, temperature of the surrounding site reached only 40.4 °C (P < 0.01). Locally injected corticosteroid reduced the incidence of nerve injury to 25.0%. However, a significant increase in nerve damage remained compared with the sham group (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION Bipolar cauterization near the nerve roots can increase the temperature of nerve roots and cause thermal nerve root injury, despite no accidental direct nerve root injury. Using saline irrigation, or setting bipolar forceps perpendicular to nerve roots, thermal elevation could be suppressed and nerve injury could be prevented. Therefore, it is recommended that surgeons set bipolar forceps perpendicular to nerve roots or use saline irrigation for the prevention of nerve root injury.

150709,COVID-19 Shines a Spotlight on the Age-Old Problem of Social Isolation.,2020-09-09,"BACKGROUND Local treatment for pulmonary metastases is considered to be a reasonable treatment option in patients with oligometastatic disease. Percutaneous radio frequency ablation (RFA) has been reported as an alternative to surgery. Results of RFA for local control of pulmonary metastases were evaluated. METHODS All consecutive patients treated with RFA for pulmonary metastases (2004-2009) were included. RFA was performed percutaneously under computed tomographic guidance. Follow-up was scheduled at 1, 3, and 6 months after treatment and every 6 months thereafter. Major outcome parameters were local and any-site progression, complications, and survival. RESULTS Ninety pulmonary metastases were treated, in 46 patients at 65 sessions. Many patients had recurrent metastases after previous surgery (n = 36 of 46). Pneumothorax occurred in 34% (chest drain in 25%) and major complications in 6%. After median follow-up of 22 months (range, 2-65 months), 25 local progressions occurred after RFA; the 2-year local progression rate per lesion was 35%. Overall survival at 3 years was 69%. CONCLUSIONS Notwithstanding its relatively low morbidity, follow-up after RFA for pulmonary metastases shows a considerable rate of local progression. The role of local ablation techniques for long-term disease control in oligometastatic disease is discussed.","von Meyenfeldt, Erik M; Prevoo, Warner; Peyrot, David; Lai A Fat, Nathalie; Burgers, Sjaak J A; Wouters, Michel W; Klomp, Houke M",Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.25958; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21319158/,429

Since cognitive deficits are common in this population, we investigated how cognition influenced their understanding of the pandemic, socio-behavioral responses and lifestyle adaptations during lockdown, and how these factors affected their mood or memory. METHOD Telephone-based survey involving 204 older adults ≥65 y/o (median: 82) with previous assessments of cognitive state: 164 normal-old (NOLD), 24 mild-neurocognitive disorder (mild-NCD), 18 mild-moderate dementia. A structured questionnaire was developed to assess psychological and socio-behavioral variables. Logistic regression was used to ascertain their effects on mood and memory. RESULTS With increasing cognitive deficits, understanding of the pandemic and the ability to follow lockdown policies, adapt to lifestyle changes, and maintain remote interactions decreased. Participants with dementia were more depressed; NOLDs remained physically and mentally active but were more bored and anxious. Sleeping and health problems independently increased the likelihood of depression (OR: 2.29; CI: 1.06-4.93; p = 0.034 and OR: 2.45; CI: 1.16-5.16; p = 0.018, respectively); Regular exercise was protective (OR: 0.30; CI: 0.12-0.72; p = 0.007). Worsening subjective memory complaints were associated with dementia (p = 0.006) and depression (p = 0.004); New-onset sleeping problems raised their odds (OR: 10.26; CI: 1.13-93.41; p = 0.039). Finally, >40% with health problems avoided healthcare mainly due to fear of contagion. DISCUSSION NOLD and mild-NCD groups showed similar mood-behavioral profiles suggesting better tolerance of lockdown. Those with dementia were unable to adapt and suffered from depression and cognitive complaints. To counteract lockdown effects, physical and mental activities and digital literacy should be encouraged.","Carlos, Arenn Faye; Poloni, Tino Emanuele; Caridi, Martina; Pozzolini, Marco; Vaccaro, Roberta; Rolandi, Elena; Cirrincione, Alice; Pettinato, Laura; Vitali, Silvia Francesca; Tronconi, Livio; Ceroni, Mauro; Guaita, Antonio",Aging & mental health,https://doi.org/10.1080/13607863.2020.1870210; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33445968/,429

The Society of Critical Care Medicine (was formed in recognition of the challenges and need for specialized treatment for these fragile patients. As the specialty has grown, it has achieved impressive scientific advances that have reduced mortality and saved lives. With those advances, however, came growing recognition that the burden of critical illness did not end at the doorstep of the hospital. Delirium, once thought to be a mere by-product of critical illness, was found to be an independent predictor of mortality, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and long-lasting cognitive impairment. Similarly, deep sedation and immobility, so often used to keep patients ""comfortable"" and to facilitate mechanical ventilation and recovery, worsen mortality and lead to the development of ICU-acquired weakness. The realization that these outcomes are inextricably linked to one another and how we manage our patients has helped us recognize the need for culture change. We, as a specialty, now understand that although celebrating the successes of survival, we now also have a duty to focus on those who survive their diseases. Led by initiatives such as the ICU Liberation Campaign of the Society of Critical Care Medicine, the natural progression of the field is now focused on getting patients back to their homes and lives unencumbered by disability and impairment.

Disease severity is influenced by several factors including the extent and localization of skin lesions, severity of pruritus and comorbidities, such as psoriatic arthritis. Moderate to severe psoriasis is defined when cutaneous involvement is diffuse, covering more than 10% of the body surface areas and/or involving the sensitive areas such as face, genitalia, folds or nails or has high impact on patients' quality of life, and it occurs in approximately 15% of cases. In recent years, a growing understanding of psoriasis pathophysiology allowed the development of an increasing number of effective and safe treatments, including biologicals that are indicated for moderate to severe psoriasis. Different classes of biologicals have been already approved, including TNF-α (etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab and certolizumab pegol), IL-12/23 (ustekinumab), IL-17 (secukinumab, ixekizumab, brodalumab) and IL-23 (guselkumab, risankizumab, tildrakizumab) inhibitors. The objective of this narrative review is to revise efficacy and safety data of the latest biologicals, small oral molecules and biosimilar drugs for the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis at Phase III of clinical development. The latest IL-17 and IL-23 inhibitors include bimekizumab, netakimab and mirikizumab as well as oral small molecules, such as deucravacitinib, a tyrosine kinase 2 selective inhibitor, and piclidenoson, an agonist of the Gi protein-associated A3 adenosine receptor.

It is also one of the genes involved in maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). We aim to investigate molecular behaviors of different INS gene variants that may correlate with the clinical spectrum of diabetes phenotypes. In this study, we concentrated on two previously uncharacterized MODY-causing mutants, proinsulin-p.Gly44Arg [G(B20)R] and p.Pro52Leu [P(B28)L] (a novel mutant identified in one French family), and an NDM causing proinsulin-p.(Cys96Tyr) [C(A7)Y]. We find that these proinsulin mutants exhibit impaired oxidative folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with blocked ER export, ER stress, and apoptosis. Importantly, the proinsulin mutants formed abnormal intermolecular disulfide bonds that not only involved the mutant proinsulin, but also the co-expressed WT-proinsulin, forming misfolded disulfide-linked proinsulin complexes. This impaired the intracellular trafficking of WT-proinsulin and limited the production of bioactive mature insulin. Notably, although all three mutants presented with similar defects in folding, trafficking, and dominant negative behavior, the degrees of these defects appeared to be different. Specifically, compared to MODY mutants G(B20)R and P(B28)L that partially affected folding and trafficking of co-expressed WT-proinsulin, the NDM mutant C(A7)Y resulted in an almost complete blockade of the ER export of WT-proinsulin, decreasing insulin production, inducing more severe ER stress and apoptosis. We thus demonstrate that differences in cell biological behaviors among different proinsulin mutants correlate with the spectrum of diabetes phenotypes caused by the different INS gene mutations.","Wang, Heting; Saint-Martin, Cécile; Xu, Jialu; Ding, Li; Wang, Ruodan; Feng, Wenli; Liu, Ming; Shu, Hua; Fan, Zhenqian; Haataja, Leena; Arvan, Peter; Bellanné-Chantelot, Christine; Cui, Jingqiu; Huang, Yumeng",Molecular and cellular endocrinology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2020.111025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916194/,429

In a local context, the University of Oldenburg (Germany) suspended all in-person lectures and business trips in March 2020, affecting the energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the community. This paper presents the evaluation of emissions resulting from mobility associated with the University of Oldenburg before and after the COVID-19 restrictions, including commuting and business trips. Moreover, five scenarios targeting a reduction in emissions related to mobility are proposed and analyzed. The GHG emissions were calculated using specific emissions factors for each mode of transport, distance data obtained via a survey, and official university data. Overall, the results have revealed a substantial decrease in emissions in the summer semester 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The estimated GHG emissions reduction relative to the average emissions of the prior two semesters (pre-COVID-19) is 79% for commuting (equivalent to 1934 tCO2e), and 69% for business trips (equivalent to 888.6 tCO2e). Furthermore, the commuting emissions are 1.9 times higher than business trip emissions in summer and winter 2019, and 1.3 times higher in summer 2020. With respect to proposals for reductions, the most effective scenario for reducing GHG emissions considers a hybrid semester assuming one day a week without commuting, which is estimated to achieve a 15% emissions reduction relative to the baseline emissions. The paper thus shows the importance of commuting-related GHG emissions in a university higher education context as well as first approaches to reduce them. This study may be useful as a guidance for the University of Oldenburg in its efforts to reduce GHG emissions by providing a quantitative basis and scenarios for prioritizing and reducing mobility emissions. Beyond that, it provides comparative metrics for other institutions with similar characteristics.","Gamba, Angela Maldonado Diana Rowen Michael Torio Herena",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13148103,429

Subsequently, we investigated, in an animal model of AD, the oral administration of Combined Metabolic Activators (CMAs), consisting of NAD+ and glutathione precursors, to explore the effect for improvement of biological functions in AD. CMAs includes L-serine, nicotinamide riboside, N-acetyl-L-cysteine, and L-carnitine tartrate, salt form of L-carnitine. The study revealed that supplementation of the CMAs improved the AD-associated histological parameters in the animals. Finally, we designed a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled human phase 2 study and showed that the administration of CMAs improves cognitive functions in AD patients. A comprehensive analysis of the human plasma metabolome and proteome revealed that plasma levels of proteins and metabolites associated with redox metabolism are significantly improved after treatment. In conclusion, our results show that treating AD patients with metabolic activators leads to enhanced cognitive functions, suggesting a role for such a therapeutic regime in treating AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.","YULUG, B.; ALTAY, O.; LI, X.; HANOGLU, L.; CANKAYA, S.; LAM, S.; YANG, H.; COSKUN, E.; IDIL, E.; NOGAYLAR, R.; BAYRAM, C.; BOLAT, I.; ONER, S.; TOZLU, O.

Methods: An anonymous 40-question questionnaire was sent online to the patients of private orthodontic clinics in 2 cities of Birjand, and Mashhad, capitals of Eastern provinces of Iran. Orthodontic patients of Mashhad dental school received the questionnaire as well. Descriptive statistics were reported, and the association between gender, oral health literacy (OHL), and adherence to orthodontic appointments and attendance, along with data on feeling, concern, and level of anxiety regarding quarantine/coronavirus pandemic were evaluated using the chi-square analysis. Results: Three hundred twenty-four patients, with a mean age of 32.43 years, answered the questionnaire. Fifty-seven percent of participants said that they only left home for their daily requirements. Seventy-two percent of the participants reported feeling calm about the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences. Most of the patients (74%) said that they would attend their orthodontic appointment in case of urgency, and 41% of patients declared that their greatest concern was the probability of a delay in completion of treatment. Forty-five percent of patients had adequate OHL. There was a significant association between OHL and willingness to attend orthodontic treatment, concerns regarding the impact of the pandemic on orthodontic treatment, and the frequency of daily teeth brushing. Conclusion: Women respected the quarantine more than men. Patients with higher OHL were more willing to attend their appointments, but only in case of an emergency, due to the outbreak of COVID-19. Women were more concerned and had better oral hygiene behaviors.","Moghadam, M. G.; Omidkhoda, M.; Kazemi, H.",Turkish Journal of Orthodontics,https://doi.org/10.5152/turkjorthod.2021.20105,429

Recently, bispecific-CART cells targeting 2 antigens are being evaluated in various clinical trials. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was done of Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane. Data presented at annual hematology and oncology conferences were also included. Results: We included 4 phase I clinical trials with a total of 77 RRMM patients between the ages of 18 to 71 years. The median follow-up duration ranged from 1 month to 27.5 months. All were lymphodepleted with Cyclophosphamide and Fludarabine before receiving CAR-T cell therapy. The CAR-T cell targets include BCMA and CD38 (dose range 0.5 x 10∧6 - 4 x 10∧6 cells/kg), BCMA and TACI (dose range 15 - 900 x 10e6 CAR-T cells), BCMA and CD19 (1 x 10e5/kg - 3 x 10e5 CAR-T cells/kg), and BCMA and CD19 (dose 1 x 10e6 cells/kg). Overall response rate (ORR) was reported by 4 trials (87.5%, 43%, 93.8%, 95%). Complete response (CR) was also reported in 4 trials as 50%, 64%, 56.3% and 14% and partial response (PR) reported as 25%, 28%, 16.6%, 14%, 18% in 5 trials (table). The most common grade 3-4 adverse effects that were reported include cytokine release syndrome, neurotoxicity, neutropenia, lymphopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, increased LDH, lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI), dehydration, renal failure (table). Yan et al. reported one death due to cerebral hemorrhage which was considered unrelated to treatment.

METHODS: Participants were infants born <32 weeks gestational age (GA), N=116. We defined family SES by the infants' health insurance (private/higher vs. public/lower) and family language by the language mothers used to communicate with clinical staff (English vs. Other language). Family SES or family language groups were compared on: (1) the total amount of KC infants experienced during hospitalization; (2) frequency of KC per visitation days; and, (3) duration of KC events per day. RESULTS: Infants in the lower SES and Other language groups experienced KC in reduced amounts, lower frequencies, and shorter durations than infants in either the higher SES or English language groups. SES and language group differences remained significant after controlling for family visitation and GA at birth. After controlling for SES, language group differences in KC duration remained significant. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed disparities in the total amount, frequency, and duration of KC in the neonatal intensive care unit as a function of both family SES and language families used to communicate with clinical staff. These disparities reduced infants' access to this developmental care practice shown to stabilize clinical status and promote neurodevelopment. We recommend that hospital nurseries implement policies that minimize such disparities.","Brignoni-Perez, E.; Scala, M.; Feldman, H. M.; Marchman, V. A.; Travis, K.

The biological drivers of AMR are well understood, but factors related to treatment-seeking and the social contexts of antibiotic (AB) use behaviours are less understood. Here we describe the Holistic Approach to Unravelling Antibacterial Resistance in East Africa (HATUA), a multi-centre consortium that investigates the diverse drivers of drug-resistance in urinary tract infections (UTIs) in East Africa. Methods and Analysis: This study will take place in Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania. We will conduct geospatial mapping of AB sellers, and conduct mystery client studies and in-depth interviews (IDI) with drug sellers to investigate AB provision practices. In parallel, we will conduct IDIs with doctors, alongside community focus groups. Clinically diagnosed UTI patients will be recruited from healthcare centres, provide urine samples, and complete a questionnaire capturing retrospective treatment pathways, socio-demographic characteristics, attitudes and knowledge. Bacterial isolates from urine and stool samples will be subject to culture and antibiotic susceptibility testing (C&AST). Genomic DNA from bacterial isolates will be extracted with a subset being sequenced. A follow-up household interview will be conducted with 1800 UTI-positive patients, where further environmental samples will be collected. A sub-sample of patients will be interviewed using qualitative tools. Questionnaire data, microbiological analysis and qualitative data will be linked at the individual level. Quantitative data will be analysed using statistical modelling including Bayesian network analysis, and all forms of qualitative data analysed through iterative thematic content analysis. Ethics and Dissemination: Approvals have been obtained from all national and local ethical review bodies in East Africa and the UK. Results will be disseminated in communities, with local and global policy stakeholders, and in academic circles.

In MHV strain A59 (MHV-A59), the replicase gene encodes two predicted papain-like proteinase (PLP) domains, PLP-1 and PLP-2. Previous work using viral polypeptide substrates synthesized by in vitro transcription and translation from the replicase gene demonstrated both cis and trans cleavage activities for PLP-1. We have cloned and overexpressed the PLP-1 domain in Escherichia coli by using a T7 RNA polymerase promoter system or as a maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion protein. With both overexpression systems, the recombinant PLP-1 exhibited trans cleavage activity when incubated with in vitro-synthesized viral polypeptide substrates. Subsequent characterization of the recombinant PLP-1 revealed that in vitro trans cleavage is more efficient at 22 degrees C than at higher temperatures. Using substrates of increasing lengths, we observed efficient cleavage by PLP-1 requires a substrate greater than 69 kDa. In addition, when PLP-1 was expressed as a polypeptide that included additional viral sequences at the carboxyl terminus of the predicted PLP-1 domain, a fivefold increase in proteolytic activity was observed. The data presented here support previous data suggesting that in vitro and in vivo cleavage of the ORF 1a polyprotein by PLP-1 can occur in both in cis and in trans. In contrast to the cleavage activity demonstrated for PLP-1, no in vitro cleavage in cis or in trans could be detected with PLP-2 expressed either as a polypeptide, including flanking viral sequences, or as an MBP fusion enzyme.","Teng, H; Piñón, J D; Weiss, S R",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10074111/,429

The blood, and still more the milk, from transgenic animals appear a very attractive source of pharmaceuticals. The cells from these animals are expected to produce well-matured proteins in potentially huge amounts. Several problems remain before this process becomes used in a large scale. Gene transfer remains a difficult and costly task for farm animals. The vectors carrying the genes coding for the proteins of interest are of unpredictable efficiency. Improvement of these vectors includes the choice of efficient promoters, introns and transcription terminators, the addition of matrix attached regions (MAR) and specialized chromatin sequences (SCS) to enhance the expression of the transgenes and to insulate them from the chromatin environment. Mice are routinely used to evaluate the gene constructs to be transferred into larger animals. Mice can also be utilized to prepare amounts as high as a few hundred mg of recombinant proteins from their milk. Rabbit appears adequate for amounts not higher than 1 kg per year. For larger quantities, goat, sheep, pig and cow are required. No recombinant proteins extracted from the blood or milk of transgenic animals are yet on the market. The relatively slow but real progress to improving the efficiency of this process inclines to be reasonably optimistic. Predictive reports suggest that 10% of the recombinant proteins, corresponding to a 100 million dollars annual market, will be prepared from the milk of transgenic animals by the end of the century.","Houdebine, L M",Journal of biotechnology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7764960/,429

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the predominant virus isolated (96 children [45.5%]), followed by influenza A virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus type 1, which were only occasionally detected. From January 2004 to April 2004, a nested retrotranscription-PCR, using in-house primers directed to the matrix protein gene of hMPV, was carried out on samples in which no other viruses were detected. hMPV was detected in 18 (16.2%) children, indicating that this virus was the second-most-frequent cause of viral respiratory infections in children less than 1 year old. The rate of hospitalization for RSV- and hMPV-infected children was higher than 75%. While RSV had a peak from December to February, hMPV was increasingly detected from January to April. The mean age of hMPV-infected children (6.44 +/- 3.64 [mean +/- standard deviation] months) was significantly higher than that of RSV-infected children (3.99 +/- 2.96 [mean +/- standard deviation] months).

In contrast, in human medicine, especially until the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, they were unimportant viruses associated with the common cold. This is a brief comparative review of the biology of coronaviral infections emphasizing the commonalities among the various members of the family and considering how the veterinary experience with coronaviruses can inform the response to SARS-CoV-2. Coronaviruses are perhaps best viewed as mutation machines whose genetic sequences can readily change through genetic drift, recombination, and deletions from a large genome. However, to be of clinical concern, variants must have the perfect set of amino acids in the S protein receptor binding domain and in their replication-mediating nonstructural proteins. Extensive experience with veterinary coronaviral vaccines suggests that optimal clinical immunity is a tandem of mucosal and systemic responses induced by a combination of mucosal and parenteral vaccines.","Ellis, John",The Canadian veterinary journal = La revue veterinaire canadienne,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34341593/,429

This study examined whether coronavirus transcription involves a discontinuous transcription step; the possibility that a leader sequence from mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) genomic RNA could be used for MHV subgenomic defective interfering (DI) RNA transcription was examined. This was tested by using helper viruses and DI RNAs that were easily distinguishable. MHV JHM variant JHM(2), which synthesizes a subgenomic mRNA encoding the HE gene, and variant JHM(3-9), which does not synthesize this mRNA, were used. An MHV DI RNA, DI(J3-9), was constructed to contain a JHM(3-9)-derived leader sequence and an inserted intergenic region derived from the region preceding the MHV JHM HE gene. DI(J3-9) replicated efficiently in JHM(2)- or JHM(3-9)-infected cells, whereas synthesis of subgenomic DI RNAs was observed only in JHM(2)-infected cells. Sequence analyses demonstrated that the 5' regions of both helper virus genomic RNAs and genomic DI RNAs maintained their original sequences in DI RNA-replicating cells, indicating that the genomic leader sequences derived from JHM(2) functioned for subgenomic DI RNA transcription. Replication and transcription of DI(J3-9) were observed in cells infected with an MHV A59 strain whose leader sequence was similar to that of JHM(2), except for one nucleotide substitution within the leader sequence. The 5' region of the helper virus genomic RNA and that of the DI RNA were the same as their original structures in virus-infected cells, and the leader sequence of DI(J3-9) subgenomic DI RNA contained the MHV A59-derived leader sequence. The leader sequence of subgenomic DI RNA was derived from that of helper virus; therefore, the genomic leader sequence had a trans-acting property indicative of a discontinuous step in coronavirus transcription.","Jeong, Y S; Makino, S",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8139040/,429

However, the experiences of these patients are to date rarely documented. AIM Gaining insight into the experiences of COVID-ICU-survivors. METHODS 19 COVID-ICU survivors answered a written survey four months after admission. Screening lists measured psychological complaints and sleeping disorders. Visual analogue scales (VAS) measured the influence of the pandemic context and the quality of life. A written survey mapped patient experiences. Quantitative data were analyzed descriptively and qualitative data by means of thematic analysis. RESULTS 50% of the participants experienced psychological complaints or sleeping disorders. A limited social network and media coverage of COVID-19 complicated the recovery process of patients. 19% of the participants experienced a reduced quality of life. A weak social network caused feelings of hopelessness. Still, patients showed great resilience. CONCLUSION Most COVID-ICU survivors are resilient enough to integrate their experiences into their lives, despite the challenges the pandemic context poses on their rehabilitation. It is therefore important not to overmedicalise psychological complaints that occur during rehabilitation. Our attention needs to be directed to those with a weak social network.","Berends, K; Claus, L; De Waele, E; Crunelle, C L; Matthys, F; Vanderbruggen, N",Tijdschrift voor psychiatrie,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34043219/,429

However, the risk of developing an alcohol use disorder could increase after Roux-en-Y bypass. The purpose of this review is to emphasize the further research needed in this area. METHODS Pubmed and Sciencedirect databases were searched. Articles written in another language than French or English as well as abstracts, conference presentations, editorials and expert opinions were excluded. RESULTS Most of studies included in this review show an increased risk of developing an AUD (alcohol use disorder) after gastric bypass surgery. Male sex, younger age, smoking, regular alcohol consumption, AUD, recreational drug use, lower sense of belonging and undergoing a RYGB (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass) were identified as risk factors. There is an alteration of alcohol metabolism after gastric bypass. Gut hormones could also play a role in the development of AUD. The hypothesis of an addiction transfer is still controversial. CONCLUSIONS The risk of developing an AUD seems to increase after surgery. Long term follow-up, after the second post-surgery year, is needed. Further researches are needed to understand the mechanisms that underlie the development of AUD.","Briegleb, Marie; Hanak, Catherine",Psychiatria Danubina,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32890386/,429

Two primers that amplify a 383-base pair product between nucleotide positions 703 and 1086 relative to the start codon for the S1 gene of the Massachusetts 41 virus were designed and used to amplify the Beaudette, Massachusetts 41, Florida 18288, Connecticut, Iowa 97, Arkansas DPI, CA/NE95/99, DE/072/ 92, and GA/0470/98 strains of IBV. The primers were specific and did not amplify New Castle disease virus, Mycoplasma spp., or infectious laryngotracheitis virus. For RRT-PCR by FRET, an anchor probe conjugated to fluorescein and a detection probe conjugated to a red fluorophore were designed to anneal to a hypervariable region within the 383-base pair product. The level of sensitivity was 1 x 10(4) RNA molecules used as starting template. After amplification, a melting curve analysis was conducted to specifically identify IBV types. Because of sequence differences in the annealing position of the detection probe, the Arkansas, Connecticut, Beaudette, and Massachusetts 41 strains could be differentiated. No fluorescence was observed for the DE/072/ 92 and GA/0470/98 viruses with the anchor and detection probes. When the Beaudette strain was examined, two melting peaks were observed at 44 C and 51 C, indicating a quasispecies in that laboratory strain of IBV. Routine typing of vaccine strains of IBV was possible with this technology, but high standard deviations associated with the melting curve analysis of the FRET probes described herein made it difficult to use this test reliably for routine typing of IBV field isolates.","Jackwood, M W; Hilt, D A; Callison, S A",Avian diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14562902/,429

Little is known in the literature on the basic neuroanatomy of this species. This study focuses on the histology and glial expression of some brain regions of the striped owl. Five owls were obtained in the wild, and their brains were routinely prepared for Haematoxylin and Eosin, and Cresyl violet staining. Immunostaining was done with anti-Calbindin, anti MBP, anti-GFAP, and anti-Iba-1 antibodies; for the expression of cerebellar Purkinje cells and white matter, cerebral astrocytes and microglia cells respectively. These were qualitatively described. We found that the hippocampal formation of the striped owl, though unique, is very similar to what is seen in mammals. The cerebellar cortex is convoluted, has a single layer of Purkinje cells with profuse dendritic arborization, a distinct external granular cell layer, and a prominent stem of white matter were seen in this study. The astrocytic population in cerebral gray is similar, though lacking in many processes as is typical in protoplasmic astrocytes, while the microglia were not strongly stained. The few stained microglia cells did not, however, show any features of activation. The striped owl's brain reveals some conserved aspects of cellular neuroanatomy in both the avian and mammals that are typical in these species. More work is however needed particularly in age related differences in these structures. This is perhaps the first report of Calbindin immunostaining in the brain of the striped owl.","Olopade, J O; Karatu, A L; Olopade, F E; Folarin, O R; Ladagu, A D; Kwari, H D",Nigerian journal of physiological sciences : official publication of the Physiological Society of Nigeria,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33084626/,429

210733,Personal protective equipment and possible routes of airborne spread during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"An emergence of a novel coronavirus, causative agent of COVID19, named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), occurred due to cross-species transmission. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses able to infect a great number of hosts. Entrance of SARS-CoV-2 depends on the surface (S) protein interaction with host ACE2 protein and cleavage by TMPRSS2. ACE2 could be a species-specific barrier that interferes with bat-to-human coronavirus cross-species transmission. Molecular analysis supported bats as natural hosts for SARS-CoV and involved them in MERS-CoV origin. The genomic similarity between bat RaTG13 CoV strain and SARS-CoV-2 implicates bats in the origin of the new outbreak. Additionally, there is a hypothesis for the zoonotic transmission based on contact with Malayan pangolins by humans in Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, China. To investigate bats and pangolin as hosts in SARS-CoV-2 cross-species transmission, we perform an evolutionary analysis combining viral and host phylogenies and divergence of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 amino acid sequences between CoV hosts. Phylogeny showed SARS-like-CoV-2 strains that infected pangolin and bats are close to SARS-CoV-2. In contrast to TMPRSS2, pangolin ACE2 amino acid sequence has low evolutionary divergence compared with humans and is more divergent from bats. Comparing SARS-CoV with SARS-CoV-2 origins, pangolin has yet lower ACE2 evolutionary divergence with humans than civet-the main intermediary host of SARS-CoV. Thus, pangolin has become an opportune host to intermediates bat-to-human SARS-CoV-2 jump and entry.","Lopes, Luciano Rodrigo; de Mattos Cardillo, Giancarlo; Paiva, Paulo Bandiera",Braz. j. microbiol,,429

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV2. In severe cases, patients may develop severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and acute cardiac injury. While seizures and status epilepticus have not been widely reported in the past five months since the onset of COVID-19 pandemic, patients with COVID-19 may have hypoxia, multiorgan failure, and severe metabolic and electrolyte disarrangements; hence, it is plausible to expect clinical or subclinical acute symptomatic seizures to happen in these patients.

The aim of this consensus statement is to define guidelines for safe clinical care for children needing inter-facility transport while making sure that the clinical teams involved are sufficiently protected from SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: A taskforce, composed of members of the European Society of Paediatric and Neonatal Intensive Care (ESPNIC) Transport section and the European Society for Paediatric Research (ESPR), reviewed the published literature and used a rapid, two-step modified Delphi process to formulate recommendations regarding safety and clinical management during transport of COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: The joint taskforce consisted of a panel of 12 experts who reached an agreement on a set of 17 recommendations specifying pertinent aspects on neonatal and paediatric COVID-19 patient transport. These included: case definition, personal protective equipment, airway management, equipment and strategies for invasive and non-invasive ventilation, special considerations for incubator and open stretcher transports, parents on transport and decontamination of transport vehicles. CONCLUSIONS: Our consensus recommendations aim to define current best-practice and should help guide transport teams dealing with infants and children with COVID-19 to work safely and effectively. IMPACT: We present European consensus recommendations on pertinent measures for transporting infants and children in times of the coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2 /COVID-19) pandemic.A panel of experts reviewed the evidence around transporting infants and children with proven or suspected COVID-19. Specific guidance on aspects of personal protective equipment, airway management and considerations for incubator and open stretcher transports is presented.Based on scant evidence, best-practice recommendations for neonatal and paediatric transport teams are presented, aiming for the protection of teams and patients.

We used the data of 88 noncritical COVID-19 MHD patients collected from 65 medical units at the hospitals in Wuhan, China, from January 1 to March 10, 2020. t-test, Wilcoxon rank sum test, and Fisher exact probability method were used to compare the baseline characteristics, treatment, and death. Log-rank test and Cox regression multivariate analysis was used to compare the survival of noncritical patients who were transferred to BSRRT modality versus those who were continued on the IHD. Univariate analysis showed the level of reported fatigue symptom at present, bilateral lung computed tomography infiltration and steroid treatment differed between the two groups. The outcome of death of the two groups did not show significant differences in univariate analysis (P = .0563). Multivariate Cox regression analysis dialysis showed modality of treatment after COVID-19 diagnosis was not a significant predictor of death (P = .1000). These data suggest that for noncritical COVID-19 MHD patients, the transfer from IHD to BSRRT does not have significant difference in the risk of death compared with IHD group.

Early prediction of progression to severe cases is needed. We retrospectively collected patients with COVID-19 in two hospital of Chongqing from 1st January to 29th February 2020. At admission, we collected the demographics and laboratory tests to predict whether the patient would progress to severe cases in hospitalization. Severe case was confirmed when one of the following criteria occurred: (a) dyspnea, respiratory rate &#8805;30 breaths/min, (b) blood oxygen saturation &#8804;93%, and (c) PaO2 /FiO2 &#8804; 300 mm Hg. At admission, 348 mild cases were enrolled in this study. Of them, 20 (5.7%) patients progressed to severe cases after median 4.0 days (interquartile range: 2.3-6.0). Pulmonary inflammation index, platelet counts, sodium, C-reactive protein, prealbumin, and PaCO2 showed good distinguishing power to predict progression to severe cases (each area under the curve of receiver operating characteristics [AUC] &#8805; 0.8). Age, heart rate, chlorine, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, procalcitonin, creatine kinase, pH, CD3 counts, and CD4 counts showed moderate distinguishing power (each AUC between 0.7-0.8). And potassium, creatinine, temperature, and D-dimer showed mild distinguishing power (each AUC between 0.6-0.7). In addition, higher C-reactive protein was associated with shorter time to progress to severe cases (r = -0.62). Several easily obtained variables at admission are associated with progression to severe cases during hospitalization.

251811,Human Touch via Touchscreen: Rural Nurses' Experiential Perspectives on Telehealth Use in Pediatric Hospice Care,2020,"During the current COVID-19 pandemic, a need for evaluation of already available drugs for treatment of the disease is crucial. Hereby, based on literature review from the current pandemic and previous outbreaks with corona viruses we analyze the impact of the virus infection on cell stress responses and redox balance. High levels of mortality are noticed in elderly individuals infected with SARS-CoV2 and during the previous SARS-CoV1 outbreak. Elderly individuals maintain a chronic low level of inflammation which is associated with oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokine production, a condition that increases the severity of viral infections in this population. Coronavirus infections can lead to alterations of redox balance in infected cells through modulation of NAD + biosynthesis, PARP function along with altering proteasome and mitochondrial function in the cell thereby leading to enhanced cell stress responses which further exacerbate inflammation. ROS production can increase IL-6 production and lipid peroxidation resulting in cell damage. Therefore, early treatment with anti-oxidants such as NAC during COVID-19 can be a way to bypass the excessive inflammation and cell damage that lead to severe infection, thus early NAC as intervention should be evaluated in a clinical trial setting.","Nasi, Aikaterini; McArdle, Stephanie; Gaudernack, Gustav; Westman, Gabriel; Melief, Cornelis; Rockberg, Johan; Arens, Ramon; Kouretas, Demetrios; Sjölin, Jan; Mangsbo, Sara",Toxicol.

The concentrations of metals were analyzed by inductive coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) after digestion with a mixture of HNO3, HCl, and H2O2. The skin-whitening creams were found to have metal concentrations in parts per million (ppm) in the following range: Hg (1.0-18,210 ppm), Co (0.1992-1.9931 ppm), Cr (1.0453-2.7455 ppm), Cu (0.6987-0.1997 ppm), Fe (8.8868-28.6213 ppm), Ni (0.7487-1.5958 ppm), Pb (0.2997-4.7287 ppm), and Zn (7819.2-39,696.7 ppm). As and Cd were not detected in any of the fifteen skin-whitening creams. Only one cream (L'Oréal Paris White Perfect) was found in safe limits defined by the Food and Drug Administration for cosmetics.

Thirty-five school aged children with at least three months of weightlifting experience were randomized to one of three training conditions: VF-PA, VF or the Control group (CONT). Subjects underwent test sessions one week before (T0) and one day after (T1) a six-session training period and a retention test session a week later (T2). During each test session, the Kinovea version 0.8.15 software measured the kinematic parameters of the snatch performance. Following distance learning sessions (T1), the VF-PA improved various kinematic parameters (i.e., barbell horizontal displacements, maximum height, looping and symmetry) compared with T0 (p < 0.5; Cohen's d = 0.58-1.1). Most of these improvements were maintained during the retention test (T2) (p<0.01, Cohen's d = 1.2-1.3) when compared withT0. However, the VF group improved only twoparameters (i.e., barbell symmetry and horizontal displacement) at T1 (p < 0.05; Cohen's d = 0.9), which were not maintained at T2. Better horizontal displacement and looping values were registered during the retention test in the VF-PA group compared with theCONT group (p < 0.05, Cohen's d = 1.49-1.52).

This may pose a potential virus transmission risk. We aimed to develop a nomogram to predict the duration of viral shedding for individual COVID-19 patients. This retrospective multicentric study enrolled 135 patients as a training cohort and 102 patients as a validation cohort. Significant factors associated with the duration of viral shedding were identified by multivariate Cox modeling in the training cohort and combined to develop a nomogram to predict the probability of viral shedding at 9, 13, 17, and 21 d after admission. The nomogram was validated in the validation cohort and evaluated by concordance index (C-index), area under the curve (AUC), and calibration curve. A higher absolute lymphocyte count (P=0.001) and lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (P=0.013) were correlated with a shorter duration of viral shedding, while a longer activated partial thromboplastin time (P=0.007) prolonged the viral shedding duration.

277192,"Improving precision and power in randomized trials for COVID-19 treatments using covariate adjustment, for binary, ordinal, and time-to-event outcomes",2020,"We extend the baseline Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) infectious disease epidemiology model to understand the role of testing and case-dependent quarantine. Our model nests the SEIR model. During a period of asymptomatic infection, testing can reveal infection that otherwise would only be revealed later when symptoms develop. Along with those displaying symptoms, such individuals are deemed known positive cases. Quarantine policy is case-dependent in that it can depend on whether a case is unknown, known positive, known negative, or recovered. Testing therefore makes possible the identification and quarantine of infected individuals and release of non-infected individuals. We fix a quarantine technology-a parameter determining the differential rate of transmission in quarantine-and compare simple testing and quarantine policies. We start with a baseline quarantine-only policy that replicates the rate at which individuals are entering quarantine in the US in March, 2020. We show that the total deaths that occur under this policy can occur under looser quarantine measures and a substantial increase in random testing of asymptomatic individuals. Testing at a higher rate in conjunction with targeted quarantine policies can (i) dampen the economic impact of the coronavirus and (ii) reduce peak symptomatic infections-relevant for hospital capacity constraints. Our model can be plugged into richer quantitative extensions of the SEIR model of the kind currently being used to forecast the effects of public health and economic policies.","Berger, D.

292651,[The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological health of healthcare workers],2020,"BACKGROUND: Current evidence indicates that children are relatively spared from direct COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality, but that the indirect effects of the pandemic pose significant risks to their health and wellbeing. OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of the local COVID-19 outbreak on routine child health services. METHODS: The District Health Information System data set for KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) provincial health services was accessed, and monthly child health-related data were extracted for the period January 2018 - June 2020. Chronological and geographical variations in sentinel indicators for service access, service delivery and the wellbeing of children were assessed. RESULTS: During April - June 2020, following the start of the COVID-19 outbreak in KZN, significant declines were seen for clinic attendance (36%; p=0.001) and hospital admissions (50%; p=0.005) of children aged &lt;5 years, with a modest recovery in clinic attendance only. Among service delivery indicators, immunisation coverage recovered most rapidly, with vitamin A supplementation, deworming and food supplementation remaining low. Changes were less pronounced for in- and out-of-hospital births and uptake rates of infant polymerase chain reaction testing for HIV at birth, albeit with wide interdistrict variations, indicating inequalities in access to and provision of maternal and neonatal care. A temporary 47% increase in neonatal facility deaths was reported in May 2020 that could potentially be attributed to COVID-19-related disruption and diversion of health resources. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple indicators demonstrated disruption in service access, service delivery and child wellbeing. Further studies are needed to establish the intermediate- and long-term impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak on child health, as well as strategies to mitigate these.","Jensen, C; McKerrow, N H",S Afr Med J,,429
292713,Seasonal Influenza Prevention and Control Progress in Latin America and the Caribbean in the Context of the Global Influenza Strategy and the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"The anti-cancer agent doxorubicin (DOX) has high cardiotoxicity that is linked to DOX-mediated increase in oxidative stress, mitochondrial iron overload, DNA damage, autophagy, necrosis, and apoptosis, all of which are also associated with secondary tumorigenicity. This limits the clinical application of DOX therapies. Previous studies have attributed DOX-mediated cardiotoxicity to mitochondrial iron accumulation and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which seem to be independent of its anti-tumor DNA damaging effects. Chemo-sensitization of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) in the cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) pathway induces tumor cell death despite the cardiotoxicity associated with DOX treatment. However, sGC-cGMP signaling must be activated during heart failure to facilitate myocardial cell survival. The sGC pathway is dependent on nitric oxide and signal transduction via the nitric oxide-sGC-cGMP pathway and is attenuated in various cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, cGMP signaling is regulated by the action of certain phosphodiesterases (PDEs) that protect the heart by inhibiting PDE, an enzyme that hydrolyses cGMP to GMP activity. In this review, we discuss the studies describing the interactions between cGMP regulation and DOX-mediated cardiotoxicity and their application in improving DOX therapeutic outcomes. The results provide novel avenues for the reduction of DOX-induced secondary tumorigenicity and improve cellular autonomy during DOX-mediated cardiotoxicity.","Cho, Haneul; Zhao, Xiao-Xiao; Lee, Sora; Woo, Jong Shin; Song, Min-Young; Cheng, Xian Wu; Lee, Kyung Hye; Kim, Weon",Am. j. cardiovasc. drugs,,429
292731,COVID-19: A systematic evaluation of personal protective equipment (PPE) performance during restraint,2021,"The double burden of malnutrition is the coexistence of two different conditions, mainly reflected as excess or deficit in weight. Anemia is a specific nutritional deficit not always included in the double burden assessment. We reviewed overweight and/or obesity (OW/OB) and anemia studies from Latin-American Children over the last ten years up to 2019. Two authors evaluated the MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and LILACS databases. A scale of ten questions was used to assess the risk of bias in prevalence studies. Fourteen studies were selected. The population studies' size ranged from 147 to 20,342 children with different socio-economic backgrounds, such as urban, peri-urban and rural settings, socio-economic status, schooling, population (ethnic minorities and indigenous), and environmental differences (sea level or high altitude). The prevalence of OW/OB ranged from 4.9% to 42%. The prevalence of anemia was from 3.4% to 67%. The double burden, including OW/OB and anemia, ranged from 0.7% to 67%. A higher prevalence of excess weight and anemia was found in rural and high altitude above sea level environments, extreme poverty, low education level, and indigenous communities. These heterogeneous data, before the 2020 (COVID-19 pandemic), reflect the vast inequities between countries and within each country. Food insecurity linked to poverty and the induced change in eating habits and lifestyles threaten optimal child nutrition in ongoing and future scenarios. The existence of OW/OB and anemia and their simultaneous coexistence in the community, home, and individual levels, indicates that interventions should be comprehensive to face the double burden of malnutrition.","Shimabuku, Roberto L; Delgado, Carlos A; Nakachi, Graciela; Teruya, Alberto A; Velasquez, Pablo M",Tohoku J Exp Med,,429
292732,COVID-19: A systematic evaluation of personal protective equipment (PPE) performance during restraint,2021,"Background: Among Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) manifestations, Olfactory (OD) and Gustatory (GD) Dysfunctions (OGD) have drawn considerable attention, becoming a sort of hallmark of the disease. Many have speculated on the pathogenesis and clinical characteristics of these disturbances; however, no definite answers have been produced on the topic. With this systematic review, we aimed to collect all the available evidence regarding the prevalence of OGD, the timing of their onset and their resolution, their rate of recovery and their role as diagnostic and prognostic tools for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Methods: A systematic review comprising all the observational studies that reported the prevalence and/or the longitudinal trajectories of OGD in COVID-19 patients, as self-reported by patients or measured through objective psychophysical tests. Results: After the selection process, 155 studies were included, with a total of 70920 patients and 105291 not-infected individuals. Prevalence reports were extremely variable across studies, with wide ranges for OD (0% - 98%) and GD (0-89%) prevalence. OGD occurred early during the disease course and only rarely preceded other symptoms; out of 30 studies with a follow-up time of at least 20 days, only in 5 studies OGD fully resolved in more than 90% of patients. OGD had low sensitivity and high specificity for SARS-CoV-2 infection; accuracy of OD and GD for infection identification was higher than 80% in 10 out of 33 studies and in 8 out of 22 studies considered, respectively. 28 out of 30 studies that studied the association between OGD and disease severity found how OGD were associated with lower rates of severe pneumonia, hospitalization and mortality. Conclusions: OGD seem to be highly prevalent in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They occur early, concomitantly with other symptoms and often persist after recovery, in some cases for months; whether a full recovery eventually occurs in all cases is not clear yet. OGD are good predictors of SARS-CoV-2 infection and are associated with a milder disease course.","Boscutti, A; Delvecchio, G; Pigoni, A; Cereda, G; Ciappolino, V; Bellani, M; Fusar-Poli, P; Brambilla, P",Brain Behav Immun Health,,429

293537,A Shot at Inclusion: Reconsidering Categorical Exclusion of Hospice Patients from COVID Vaccine Allocation,2021,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to examine the consequences of Covid-19-related isolation and social restrictions on the well-being of nursing home residents and their family members, and to analyze how distancing has affected the relationships of family members with residents and the nursing home staff. DESIGN: The data consist of 41 thematic one-on-one interviews conducted during May-December 2020 with family members of nursing home residents. Convenience sampling was utilized by asking several nursing homes in different parts of Finland to relay a contact request from the researchers to the residents' family members. The main themes of the interviews were lockdown and visiting restrictions. Subthemes included the frequency of visits, other means of interaction, changes in the relationships of family members with their loved ones and with nursing home staff, and the feelings aroused by the situation. The interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, resulting in 794 pages of data. METHOD: The qualitative study uses inductive content analysis. NVivo12 software facilitated the systematic coding of the data. RESULTS: According to the family members, distancing aggravated the residents' pre-existing conditions: they reported a sudden progression in memory disorders and significant deterioration in physical abilities, for example. Both residents and family members experienced anxiety, grief, and severe stress, and family members expressed concern that residents might die due to a lack of social contact and activity. Family members were also frustrated about not being able to touch their relatives or participate in their care, and therefore sometimes thought that their visits were useless. New forms of interaction with family members, introduced by the nursing homes, were appreciated. However, some family members perceived the interactional protocols as unfair and complained about insufficient information. CONCLUSIONS: The findings underline the need for nursing homes to implement a good interactional protocol. Overall, the results show that the measures taken to protect residents' health during the Covid-19 outbreak were short-sighted in terms of the social dimension of well-being. It is therefore important to continue developing safe and humane solutions for interaction when social restrictions are in place.

294126,How to Leverage Collaborations Between the BME Community and Local Hospitals to Address Critical Personal Protective Equipment Shortages During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Inspired by a recent work of Crovisier and Pujals on mildly dissipative diffeomorphisms of the plane, we show that H\'enon-like and Lozi-like maps on their strange attractors are conjugate to natural extensions (a.k.a. shift homeomorphisms on inverse limits) of maps on metric trees with dense set of branch points. In consequence, these trees very well approximate the topology of the attractors, and the maps on them give good models of the dynamics. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first examples of canonical two-parameter families of attractors in the plane for which one is guaranteed such a 1-dimensional locally connected model tying together topology and dynamics of these attractors. For H\'enon maps this applies to Benedicks-Carleson positive Lebesgue measure parameter set, and sheds more light onto the result of Barge from 1987, who showed that there exist parameter values for which H\'enon maps on their attractors are not natural extensions of any maps on branched 1-manifolds. For Lozi maps the result applies to an open set of parameters given by Misiurewicz in 1980. In general, under mild dissipation, conjugacy holds if the attractor does not have an arc in common with a stable manifold, and the density of branch points holds when the attractor is a homoclinic class. Our result can be seen as a generalization to the non-uniformly hyperbolic world of a classical result of Williams from 1967.","Boro'nski, Jan; vStimac, S.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.14780v1.pdf,429

294493,Predicting COVID-19 vaccine take-up: Moving beyond demographics,2021,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a novel beta-coronavirus that has recently emerged as the cause of the 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based tests are optimal and recommended for the diagnosis of an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Serology tests for viral antibodies provide an important tool to diagnose previous exposure to the virus. Here we evaluate the analytical performance parameters of the Diazyme SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG serology assays and describe the kinetics of IgM and IgG seroconversion observed in patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to our hospital. METHODS: We validated the performance of the Diazyme assay in 235 presumed SARS-CoV-2 negative subjects to determine specificity. Subsequently, we evaluated the SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG seroconversion of 54 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients and determined sensitivity of the assay at three different timeframes. RESULT: Sensitivity and specificity for detecting seropositivity at &#8805;15 days following a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR result, was 100.0% and 98.7% when assaying for the panel of IgM and IgG. The median time to seropositivity observed for a reactive IgM and IgG result from the date of a positive PCR was 5 days (IQR: 2.75-9 days) and 4 days (IQR: 2.75-6.75 days), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that the Diazyme IgM/IgG assays are suited for the purpose of detecting SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM in patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infections. For the first time, we report longitudinal data showing the evolution of seroconversion for both IgG and IgM in a cohort of acutely ill patients in the United States. We also demonstrate a low false positive rate in patients who were presumed to be disease free.","Suhandynata, Raymond T; Hoffman, Melissa A; Kelner, Michael J; McLawhon, Ronald W; Reed, Sharon L; Fitzgerald, Robert L",J Appl Lab Med,,429

302702,Game theory to enhance stock management of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) during the COVID-19 outbreak,2021,"BACKGROUND: New therapeutic options to address the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are urgently needed. One possible strategy is the repurposing of existing drugs approved for other indications as antiviral agents for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Due to the commercial unavailability of SARS-CoV-2 drugs for treating COVID-19, we screened approximately 250 existing drugs or pharmacologically active compounds for their inhibitory activities against feline infectious peritonitis coronavirus (FIPV) and human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), a human coronavirus in the same genus (Betacoronavirus) as SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: FIPV was proliferated in feline Fcwf-4 cells and HCoV-OC43 in human HCT-8 cells. Viral proliferation was assayed by visualization of cytopathic effects on the infected Fcwf-4 cells and immunofluorescent assay for detection of the nucleocapsid proteins of HCoV-OC43 in the HCT-8 cells. The concentrations (EC50) of each drug necessary to diminish viral activity to 50% of that for the untreated controls were determined. The viabilities of Fcwf-4 and HCT-8 cells were measured by crystal violet staining and MTS/PMS assay, respectively. RESULTS: Fifteen out of the 252 drugs or pharmacologically active compounds screened were found to be active against both FIPV and HCoV-OC43, with EC50 values ranging from 11 nM to 75 µM. They are all old drugs as follows, anisomycin, antimycin A, atovaquone, chloroquine, conivaptan, emetine, gemcitabine, homoharringtonine, niclosamide, nitazoxanide, oligomycin, salinomycin, tilorone, valinomycin, and vismodegib. CONCLUSION: All of the old drugs identified as having activity against FIPV and HCoV-OC43 have seen clinical use in their respective indications and are associated with known dosing schedules and adverse effect or toxicity profiles in humans. Those, when later confirmed to have an anti-viral effect on SARS-CoV-2, should be considered for immediate uses in COVID-19 patients.","Yang, Cheng-Wei; Peng, Tzu-Ting; Hsu, Hsing-Yu; Lee, Yue-Zhi; Wu, Szu-Huei; Lin, Wen-Hsing; Ke, Yi-Yu; Hsu, Tsu-An; Yeh, Teng-Kuang; Huang, Wen-Zheng; Lin, Jiunn-Horng; Sytwu, Huey-Kang; Chen, Chiung-Tong; Lee, Shiow-Ju",Biomed J,,429

310818,Face mask healthy or unhealthy- A review,2020,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented increased usage of Personal protective equipment (PPE) by healthcare-workers. PPE usage causes headache in majority of users. We evaluated changes in cerebral hemodynamics among healthcare-workers using PPE. METHODS: Frontline healthcare-workers donning PPE at our tertiary center were included. Demographics, co-morbidities and blood-pressure were recorded. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) monitoring of middle cerebral artery was performed with 2-MHz probe. Mean flow velocity (MFV) and pulsatility index (PI) were recorded at baseline, after donning N95 respirator-mask, and after donning powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR), when indicated. End-tidal carbon-dioxide (ET-CO2) pressure was recorded for participants donning PAPR in addition to the N95 respirator-mask. RESULTS: A total of 154 healthcare-workers (mean age 29 ± 12 years, 67% women) were included. Migraine was the commonest co-morbidity in 38 (25%) individuals while 123 (80%) developed de-novo headache due to N95 mask. Donning of N95 respirator-mask resulted in significant increase in MFV (4.4 ± 10.4 cm/s, p < 0.001) and decrease in PI (0.13 ± 0.12; p < 0.001) while ET-CO2 increased by 3.1 ± 1.2 mmHg (p < 0.001). TCD monitoring in 24 (16%) participants donning PAPR and N95 respirator mask together showed normalization of PI, accompanied by normalization of ET-CO2 values within 5-min. Combined use of N95 respirator-mask and PAPR was more comfortable as compared to N95 respirator-mask alone. CONCLUSION: Use of N95 respirator-mask results in significant alterations in cerebral hemodynamics. However, these effects are mitigated by the use of additional PAPR. We recommend the use of PAPR together with the N95 mask for healthcare-workers doing longer duties in the hospital wards.","Bharatendu, Chandra; Ong, Jonathan J Y; Goh, Yihui; Tan, Benjamin Y Q; Chan, Amanda C Y; Tang, Jonathan Z Y; Leow, Aloysius S; Chin, Amanda; Sooi, Kenneth W X; Tan, Yi Lin; Hong, Chiew S; Chin, Benjamin Z; Ng, Elizabeth; Foong, Theng Wai; Teoh, Hock Luen; Ong, Shi Ting; Lee, Pyng; Khoo, Deborah; Tsivgoulis, Georgios; Alexandrov, Andrei V; Sharma, Vijay K",J Neurol Sci,,429
311135,Life-Saving Procedures Performed While Wearing CBRNe Personal Protective Equipment: A Mannequin Randomized Trial,2021,"A focus on helping others is generally lauded, particularly in medicine, but in the context of a pandemic when health care professionals are facing increased risk, loss, and trauma, this focus can potentially be detrimental. In this study, we sought to (a) examine if health care workers intensely involved in the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are experiencing negative psychological and emotional outcomes, and (b) investigate if helping related factors (prosocial motivation and perceived prosocial impact) exacerbate and mitigate relationships to negative outcomes in a crisis situation. Using data collected from doctors and nurses before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, we examine the relationship between intensity of involvement in the COVID-19 pandemic response and emotional exhaustion and depression, as well as the moderating effects of prosocial motivation and perceived prosocial impact. Data was collected at three time points (T1 and T2 prepandemic, and T3 during COVID-19), with prosocial motivation and controls collected at T1/T2 and predictors and outcomes collected during the pandemic. We find that intensity of involvement does associate with emotional exhaustion at work and that higher prosocial motivation exacerbates this relationship. Supplemental analyses suggest that the exposure to self-dimension of involvement is positively associated with emotional exhaustion and depression. Understanding the roles of prosocial motivation and prosocial impact in managing regulatory resources has important ramifications for health care workers on the frontlines of health crises responses, as these resources are necessary to manage the associated trauma.

OBJECTIVE: To observe the association between ABO blood groups and the presentation and outcomes of confirmed COVID-19 cases. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a prospective cohort study of patients with mild-to-moderately severe COVID-19 infections who presented in the COVID-19 unit of Dhaka Medical College Hospital and were enrolled between 01 June and 25 August, 2020. Patients were followed up for at least 30 days after disease onset. We grouped participants with A-positive and A-negative blood groups into group I and participants with other blood groups into group II. RESULTS: The cohort included 438 patients; 52 patients were lost to follow-up, five died, and 381 completed the study. The prevalence of blood group A [144 (32.9%)] was significantly higher among COVID-19 patients than in the general population (p < 0.001). The presenting age [mean (SD)] of group I [42.1 (14.5)] was higher than that of group II [38.8 (12.4), p = 0.014]. Sex (p = 0.23) and co-morbidity (hypertension, p = 0.34; diabetes, p = 0.13) did not differ between the patients in groups I and II. No differences were observed regarding important presenting symptoms, including fever (p = 0.72), cough (p = 0.69), and respiratory distress (p = 0.09). There was no significant difference in the median duration of symptoms in the two group (12 days), and conversion to the next level of severity was observed in 26 (20.6%) and 36 patients (13.8%) in group I and II, respectively. However, persistent positivity of RT-PCR at 14 days of initial positivity was more frequent among the patients in group I [24 (19%)] than among those in group II [29 (11.1%)]. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of blood group A was higher among COVID-19 patients. Although ABO blood groups were not associated with the presentation or recovery period of COVID-19, patients with blood group A had delayed seroconversion.","Mahmud, Reaz; Rassel, Mohammad Aftab; Monayem, Farhana Binte; Sayeed, S K Jakaria Been; Islam, Md Shahidul; Islam, Mohammed Monirul; Yusuf, Mohammad Abdullah; Rahman, Sabrina; Islam, K M Nazmul; Mahmud, Imran; Hossain, Mohammad Zaid; Chowdhury, Ahmed Hossain; Kabir, A K M Humayon; Ahmed, Kazi Gias Uddin; Rahman, Md Mujibur",PLoS One,,429

In this article, we summarize the current state of POC tools and propose an all-in-one, highly sensitive POC assay that integrates antibody detection, protein detection, and serum cytokine detection to diagnose COVID-19 infection. We believe this article will provide insight into the current state of POC diagnostics for COVID-19, and promote additional research and tool development that could be exceptionally impactful.","Wang, Yung-Chih; Lee, Yi-Tzu; Yang, Ting; Sun, Jun-Ren; Shen, Ching-Fen; Cheng, Chao-Min",Bioeng Transl Med,,429

313799,Structural inequities in the global supply of personal protective equipment,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The virtual interview for residency and fellowship applicants has previously been utilized preliminarily in their respective processes. The COVID-19 pandemic forced many programs to switch to a virtual interview process on short notice. In the independent plastic surgery process, which was underway when the pandemic started, applicants had a heterogeneous experience of in-person and virtual interviews. The purpose of this study was to assess if applicants prefer a virtual interview experience to an in-person interview as well as determine if virtual interview applicants had a different opinion of a program compared to the in-person interview applicants. DESIGN/SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: The 2019 to 2020 applicants who interviewed at the Indiana University Independent Plastic Surgery program were administered an anonymous online survey about their interview experience at our program. RESULTS: Our survey response was 60% (18/30). The in-person interview group (nâ¯=â¯10) rated their overall interview experience higher than the virtual interview group (nâ¯=â¯8) 8.8 vs 7.5 (pâ¯=â¯0.0314). The in-person interview group felt they became more acquainted with the program, the faculty, and the residents more than the virtual group (4.7 vs 3.25, p < 0.0001) (4.3 vs 3.25, pâ¯=â¯0.0194) (4.3 vs 2.75, p < 0.0001). The majority of applicants favored in-person interviews (16/18, 88.9%). The in-person interview group spent significantly more money on their interview at our program compared to the virtual interview group ($587 vs $0, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that the virtual interview process was an efficient process for applicants from both a financial and time perspective. However, the virtual interview process left applicants less satisfied with their interview experience. The applicants felt they did not become as acquainted with the program as their in-person counterparts. The virtual interview process may play a large role in residency and fellowship applications in the future, and programs should spend time on how to improve the process.","Bamba, Ravinder; Bhagat, Neel; Tran, Phu C; Westrick, Evan; Hassanein, Aladdin H; Wooden, William A",J. surg. educ,,429

However, the cardiovascular system is greatly affected by these conditions and is often responsible for complications and mortality of these patients. In order to show the cardiovascular implications in patients infected with COVID-19 and the importance of social isolation as an alternative to curb the spread of the disease, a literature review was carried out based on 37 articles, in English, Portuguese and Spanish, available on Scielo and PubMed. The findings showed that cardiac complications associated with COVID-19 infection are similar to those produced by: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and influenza. However, COVID-19 has a much greater and faster contamination and, unlike influenza, there is no vaccine or treatment available yet. In view of this, social isolation becomes a tool that can reduce and flatten the curve of cases and thus protect the people at higher risk, decreasing the chances of serious conditions related to the disease, potential deaths and the collapse of the country's health system.","Costa, Juliana Alves; Silveira, Juliana de Almeida; Santos, Sara Cristine Marques Dos; Nogueira, Patrícia Pereira",Arq Bras Cardiol,,429

326609,Loss and grief amidst COVID-19: A path to adaptation and resilience,2020,"BACKGROUND: The most recent emerging infectious disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is pandemic now. Iran is a country with community transmission of the disease. Telehealth tools have been proved to be useful in controlling public health disasters. We developed an online self-screening platform to offer a population-wide strategy to control the massive influx to medical centers. METHODS: We developed a platform operating based on given history by participants, including sex, age, weight, height, location, primary symptoms and signs, and high risk past medical histories. Based on a decision-making algorithm, participants were categorized into four levels of suspected cases, requiring diagnostic tests, supportive care, not suspected cases. We made comparisons with Iran STEPs (STEPwise approach to Surveillance) 2016 study and data from the Statistical Centre of Iran to assess population representativeness of data. Also, we made a comparison with officially confirmed cases to investigate the effectiveness of the platform. A multilevel mixed-effects Poisson regression was used to check the association of visiting platform and deaths caused by COVID-19. RESULTS: About 310 000 individuals participated in the online self-screening platform in 33 days. The majority of participants were in younger age groups, and males involved more. A significant number of participants were screened not to be suspected or needing supportive care, and only 10.4% of males and 12.0% of females had suspected results of COVID-19. The penetration of the platform was assessed to be acceptable. A correlation coefficient of 0.51 was calculated between suspected results and confirmed cases of the disease, expressing the platform's effectiveness. CONCLUSION: Implementation of a proper online self-screening tool can mitigate population panic during wide-spread epidemics and relieve massive influx to medical centers. Also, an evidence-based education platform can help fighting infodemic. Noticeable utilization and verified effectiveness of such platform validate the potency of telehealth tools in controlling epidemics and pandemics.","Azadnajafabad, Sina; Saeedi Moghaddam, Sahar; Rezaei, Negar; Ghasemi, Erfan; Naderimagham, Shohreh; Azmin, Mehrdad; Mohammadi, Esmaeil; Jamshidi, Kosar; Fattahi, Nima; Zokaei, Hossein; Mehregan, Ashkan; Damerchilu, Bahman; Fathi, Pouya; Erfani, Hossein; Norouzinejad, Abbas; Gouya, Mohammad Mehdi; Jamshidi, Hamidreza; Malekzadeh, Reza; Larijani, Bagher; Farzadfar, Farshad",Int. j. health policy manag,,429
327783,Epidemiology of and Risk Factors for Coronavirus Infection in Health Care Workers: A Living Rapid Review,2020,"The rise of social networks as the primary means of communication in almost every country in the world has simultaneously triggered an increase in the amount of fake news circulating online. This fact became particularly evident during the 2016 U.S. political elections and even more so with the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Several research studies have shown how the effects of fake news dissemination can be mitigated by promoting greater competence through lifelong learning and discussion communities, and generally rigorous training in the scientific method and broad interdisciplinary education. The urgent need for models that can describe the growing infodemic of fake news has been highlighted by the current pandemic. The resulting slowdown in vaccination campaigns due to misinformation and generally the inability of individuals to discern the reliability of information is posing enormous risks to the governments of many countries. In this research using the tools of kinetic theory we describe the interaction between fake news spreading and competence of individuals through multi-population models in which fake news spreads analogously to an infectious disease with different impact depending on the level of competence of individuals. The level of competence, in particular, is subject to an evolutionary dynamic due to both social interactions between agents and external learning dynamics. The results show how the model is able to correctly describe the dynamics of diffusion of fake news and the important role of competence in their containment.","Franceschi, Jonathan; Pareschi, Lorenzo",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.14087v1.pdf,429
328778,Contamination of personal protective equipment during COVID-19 autopsies,2021,"This paper traces the plunge and rebound of the taxi market in Shenzhen, China through the COVID-19 lockdown. A four-week taxi GPS trajectory data set is collected in the first quarter of 2020, which covers the period of lockdown and phased reopening in the city. We conduct a spatiotemporal analysis of taxi demand using the data, and then select taxis that continued to operate through the analysis period to examine whether and how they adjusted operational strategies. We find, among other things: (i) the taxi demand in Shenzhen shrank more than 85% in the lockdown phase and barely recovered from that bottom even after the city began to reopen;(ii) the recovery of taxi travel fell far behind that of the overall vehicle travel in the city;(iii) most taxis significantly cut back work hours in response to the lockdown, and many adjusted work schedule to focus on serving peak-time demand after it was lifted;(iv) taxi drivers demonstrate distinct behavioral adaptations to the pandemic that can be identified by a clustering analysis;and (v) while the level of taxi service dropped precipitately at the beginning, it quickly rebounded to exceed the pre-pandemic level, thanks to the government’s incentive policy. These empirical findings suggest (i) incentives aiming at boosting supply should more precisely target where the boost is most needed;(ii) the taxi market conditions should be closely monitored to support and adjust policies;and (iii) when the demand is severely depressed by lockdown orders or when the market is oversupplied, taxi drivers should be encouraged and aided to use more centralized dispatching modes.","Zheng, Hongyu Zhang Kenan Nie Yu",Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice,,429
328983,Work place spirituality: How does it impact junior resident doctors’ employee engagement in multispecialty hospitals during COVID-19? An experience from NABH accredited hospitals in Karnataka,2020,"A growing body of evidence demonstrates that asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is a major contributor to the COVID-19 pandemic. Frontline healthcare workers in COVID-19 hotspots have faced numerous challenges, including shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) and difficulties acquiring clinical testing. The magnitude of the exposure of healthcare workers and the potential for asymptomatic transmission makes it critical to understand the incidence of infection in this population. To determine the prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst healthcare workers, we studied frontline staff working in the Montefiore Health System in New York City. All participants were asymptomatic at the time of testing and were tested by RT-qPCR and for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The medical, occupational, and COVID-19 exposure histories of participants were recorded via questionnaires. Of the 98 asymptomatic healthcare workers tested, 19 (19.4%) tested positive by RT-qPCR and/or ELISA. Within this group, four (4.1%) were RT-qPCR positive, and four (4.1%) were PCR and IgG positive. Notably, an additional 11 (11.2%) individuals were IgG positive without a positive PCR. Two PCR positive individuals subsequently developed COVID-19 symptoms, while all others remained asymptomatic at 2-week follow-up. These results indicate that there is considerable asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2 within the healthcare workforce, despite current mitigation policies. Furthermore, presuming that asymptomatic staff are not carrying SARS-CoV-2 is inconsistent with our results, and this could result in amplified transmission within healthcare settings.

331671,Cutaneous hyperesthesia: A novel manifestation of COVID-19,2020,"Background While Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with increased risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) during hospitalization despite prophylactic anticoagulation, there is a lack of evidence-based guidelines for dose escalation of anticoagulation for patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Methods This single-center retrospective cohort study was part of a quality improvement program evaluating safety and efficacy of anticoagulation protocols at our large, metropolitan public hospital. We implemented a D-dimer-based guideline for dosing unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in COVID-19 hospitalized patients that allowed for up-titration from standard prophylactic dosing to escalated prophylactic dosing or therapeutic dosing based on patient risk and presence of known or highly suspected VTE. Primary endpoints were International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH)-defined major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB) events and in-hospital survival. Findings Among 262 COVID-19-infected patients hospitalized between March 15th and June 15th, 2020, 125 (73.1%) were male. Highest anticoagulation dose was: 65.3% prophylactic, 13.4% escalated prophylactic, 21.4% therapeutic. The dose was uptitrated in 83 (31.6%) patients. Bleeding events were comparable between the therapeutic (12.5%) and escalated prophylactic groups (11.4%), but significantly higher than in the prophylactic group (1.2%). In-hospital survival at 28 days was superior among patients whose anticoagulation was uptitrated to either escalated prophylactic or therapeutic (77.6%), compared to those receiving fixed prophylactic (56.7%) or fixed therapeutic (26.7%) dosing (p = 0.001). Conclusion A dynamic, D-dimer based dose escalation of anticoagulation for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 may improve in-hospital mortality without increasing fatal bleeding.","Bhoopat, Lantarima Martynova Anastasia Choi April Pattaranithima Pattharawin Han Semi Du Senxi Syed Ibrahim Chan Catherine Oh Esther E.; Borok, Zea Liebler Janice Lee Wilson Melissa Tantiyavarong Pichaya O039; Connell, Casey",Thrombosis Update,,429
332440,Developing of the modernization paradigm and the ideas of neoconvergence after the global crisis Covid 19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Descriptions of cutaneous findings associated with COVID-19 have not been consistently accompanied by histopathology or confirmatory testing for SARS-CoV-2. OBJECTIVE: To describe and classify the cutaneous findings with supporting histopathology of confirmed COVID-19 inpatients. METHODS: We included consecutive inpatients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 for whom a dermatology consult was requested. A skin biopsy was performed in all cases. Skin findings were classified as being compatible with a cutaneous manifestation of COVID-19 or as representing a distinct clinical entity. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients were studied in whom thirty-one dermatologic diagnoses were made. Twenty-two of the dermatoses were compatible with a cutaneous manifestation of COVID-19; nine entities were not associated with infection by SARS-CoV-2. The most common COVID-19-associated pattern was an exanthematous presentation. In four patients, a new pattern was observed, characterized by discrete papules with varied histopathological findings including a case of neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis. No cases of pernio-like lesions were identified. Skin findings not associated with COVID-19 represented 29% of diagnoses and included Malassezia folliculitis, tinea, miliaria, and contact dermatitis. LIMITATIONS: There is no gold-standard test to distinguish between viral exanthems and drug reactions. CONCLUSION: A histopathological study is critical before attributing skin findings to a manifestation of COVID-19.","Barrera-Godínez, A; Méndez-Flores, S; Gatica-Torres, M; Rosales-Sotomayor, A; Campos-Jiménez, K I; Carrillo-Córdova, D M; Durand-Muñoz, M C; Mena-Hernández, G L; Melchor-Mendoza, Y K; Ruelas-Villavicencio, A L; García-Irigoyen, A; Acatitla-Acevedo, G A; Toussaint-Caire, S; Domínguez-Cherit, J",J.

This necessitates a remote examination of such patients without sacrificing information quality. RESEARCH QUESTION: The goal of this study was to assess the feasibility of a 5G-based robot-assisted remote ultrasound system in examining patients with COVID-19 and to establish an examination protocol for telerobotic ultrasound scanning. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-three patients with COVID-19 were included and divided into two groups. Twelve were nonsevere cases, and 11 were severe cases. All patients underwent a 5G-based robot-assisted remote ultrasound system examination of the lungs and heart following an established protocol. Distribution characteristics and morphology of the lung and surrounding tissue lesions, left ventricular ejection fraction, ventricular area ratio, pericardial effusion, and examination-related complications were recorded. Bilateral lung lesions were evaluated by using a lung ultrasound score. RESULTS: The remote ultrasound system successfully and safely performed cardiopulmonary examinations of all patients. Peripheral lung lesions were clearly evaluated. Severe cases of COVID-19 had significantly more diseased regions (median [interquartile range], 6.0 [2.0-11.0] vs 1.0 [0.0-2.8]) and higher lung ultrasound scores (12.0 [4.0-24.0] vs 2.0 [0.0-4.0]) than nonsevere cases of COVID-19 (both, P < .05).

Lung histopathology often reveals fibrin-based blockages in the small blood vessels of patients who succumb to the disease. Antiphospholipid syndrome is an acquired and potentially life-threatening thrombophilia in which patients develop pathogenic autoantibodies targeting phospholipids and phospholipid-binding proteins (aPL antibodies). Case series have recently detected aPL antibodies in patients with COVID-19. Here, we measured eight types of aPL antibodies in serum samples from 172 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. These aPL antibodies included anticardiolipin IgG, IgM, and IgA; anti-ß2 glycoprotein I IgG, IgM, and IgA; and anti-phosphatidylserine/prothrombin (aPS/PT) IgG and IgM. We detected aPS/PT IgG in 24% of serum samples, anticardiolipin IgM in 23% of samples, and aPS/PT IgM in 18% of samples. Antiphospholipid autoantibodies were present in 52% of serum samples using the manufacturer's threshold and in 30% using a more stringent cutoff (&#8805;40 ELISA-specific units). Higher titers of aPL antibodies were associated with neutrophil hyperactivity, including the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), higher platelet counts, more severe respiratory disease, and lower clinical estimated glomerular filtration rate. Similar to IgG from patients with antiphospholipid syndrome, IgG fractions isolated from patients with COVID-19 promoted NET release from neutrophils isolated from healthy individuals. Furthermore, injection of IgG purified from COVID-19 patient serum into mice accelerated venous thrombosis in two mouse models. These findings suggest that half of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 become at least transiently positive for aPL antibodies and that these autoantibodies are potentially pathogenic.","Zuo, Yu; Estes, Shanea K; Ali, Ramadan A; Gandhi, Alex A; Yalavarthi, Srilakshmi; Shi, Hui; Sule, Gautam; Gockman, Kelsey; Madison, Jacqueline A; Zuo, Melanie; Yadav, Vinita; Wang, Jintao; Woodard, Wrenn; Lezak, Sean P; Lugogo, Njira L; Smith, Stephanie A; Morrissey, James H; Kanthi, Yogendra; Knight, Jason S",Sci. transl. med,,429
355413,Catatonia in a hospitalized patient with COVID-19 and proposed immune-mediated mechanism,2020,"The Covid-19 pandemic has made clear the need to improve modern multivariate time-series forecasting models. Current state of the art predictions of future daily deaths and, especially, hospital resource usage have confidence intervals that are unacceptably wide. Policy makers and hospitals require accurate forecasts to make informed decisions on passing legislation and allocating resources. We used US county-level data on daily deaths and population statistics to forecast future deaths. We extended the SIR epidemiological model to a novel model we call the PECAIQR model. It adds several new variables and parameters to the naive SIR model by taking into account the ramifications of the partial quarantining implemented in the US. We fitted data to the model parameters with numerical integration. Because of the fit degeneracy in parameter space and non-constant nature of the parameters, we developed several methods to optimize our fit, such as training on the data tail and training on specific policy regimes. We use cross-validation to tune our hyper parameters at the county level and generate a CDF for future daily deaths. For predictions made from training data up to May 25th, we consistently obtained an averaged pinball loss score of 0.096 on a 14 day forecast. We finally present examples of possible avenues for utility from our model. We generate longer-time horizon predictions over various 1-month windows in the past, forecast how many medical resources such as ventilators and ICU beds will be needed in counties, and evaluate the efficacy of our model in other countries.","Bao, Richard; Chen, August; Gowda, Jethin; Mudide, Shiva",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.13693v1.pdf,429

Plasma samples from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) PCR-positive individuals (Uganda, 78 samples from 78 individuals, and Baltimore, 266 samples from 38 individuals) and from prepandemic individuals (Uganda, 1,077, and Baltimore, 532) were evaluated. Prevalence ratios (PR) were calculated to identify factors associated with a false-positive test. After the first positive PCR in Ugandan samples, the sensitivity was 45% (95% confidence interval [CI], 24,68) at 0 to 7 days, 79% (95% CI, 64 to 91) at 8 to 14 days, and 76% (95% CI, 50 to 93) at >15 days.

The specificity of 96.5% (95% CI, 97.5 to 95.2) in Ugandan samples was significantly lower than that in samples from Baltimore, 99.3% (95% CI, 98.1 to 99.8; P < 0.01).

Sensitivity of the CoronaCHEK was similar in samples from Uganda and Baltimore. The specificity was significantly lower in Ugandan samples than in Baltimore samples.

However, given the mobile technology that is frequently used for these assessments, concise assessments are preferred. The current study compared single-item ratings with multiple-item subscale scores of the same construct, by calculating the corresponding Bland and Altman 95% limits of agreement interval. The analysis showed that single-item ratings are usually in good agreement with assessments of their corresponding subscale. In the case of more complex multimodal constructs, single-item assessments were much less often in agreement with multiple-item questionnaire outcomes. The use of single-item assessments is advocated as they more often incorporate assessments of all aspects of a certain construct (including the presence, severity, and impact of the construct under investigation) compared to composite symptom scores.","Verster, Joris C.; Sandalova, Elena Garssen Johan Bruce Gillian","European Journal of Investigation in Health, Psychology and Education",,429

Acknowledging the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to mutate into distinct strains as an RNA virus and investigating its potential to cause reinfection is important for future health policy guidelines. It was thought that individuals who recovered from COVID-19 generate a robust immune response and develop protective immunity; however, since the first case of documented reinfection of COVID-19 in August 2020, there have been a number of cases with reinfection. Many cases are lacking genomic data of the two infections, and it remains unclear whether they were caused by different strains. In the present study, we undertook a rapid systematic review to identify cases infected with different genetic strains of SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by PCR and viral genome sequencing. A total of 17 cases of genetically confirmed COVID-19 reinfection were found. One immunocompromised patient had mild symptoms with the first infection but developed severe symptoms resulting in death with the second infection. Overall, 68.8% (11/16) had similar severity; 18.8% (3/16) had worse symptoms; and 12.5% (2/16) had milder symptoms with the second episode. Our case series shows that reinfection with different strains is possible, and some cases may experience more severe infections with the second episode. The findings also suggest that COVID-19 may continue to circulate even after achieving herd immunity through natural infection or vaccination, suggesting the need for longer-term transmission mitigation efforts.","Wang, Jingzhou; Kaperak, Christopher; Sato, Toshiro; Sakuraba, Atsushi",J. invest. med,,429

Despite focused efforts to achieve this balance, the frequency of both thrombotic and bleeding events remains high. Anticoagulation is complicated to manage in this population due to the complexities of the hemostatic system that are compounded by age-related developmental hemostatic changes, variable effects of the etiology of critical illness on hemostasis, and blood-circuit interaction. Lack of high-quality data to guide anticoagulation management in ECMO patients results in marked practice variability among centers. One aspect of anticoagulation therapy that is particularly challenging is the use of antithrombin (AT) supplementation for heparin resistance. This is especially controversial in the neonatal and pediatric population due to the baseline higher risk of bleeding in this cohort. The indication for AT supplementation is further compounded by the potential inaccuracy of the diagnosis of heparin resistance based on the standard laboratory parameters used to assess heparin effect. With concerns regarding the adverse impact of bleeding and thrombosis, clinicians and institutions are faced with making difficult, real-time decisions aimed at optimizing anticoagulation in this setting. In this clinically focused review, the authors discuss the complexities of anticoagulation monitoring and therapeutic intervention for patients on ECMO and examine the challenges surrounding AT supplementation given both the historical and current perspectives summarized in the literature on these topics.","Chlebowski, Meghan M; Baltagi, Sirine; Carlson, Mel; Levy, Jerrold H; Spinella, Philip C",Crit Care,,429

Its effect and impact are still evolving, with deaths estimated to reach 40 million if unchecked. One effective and complementary strategy to slow the spread and reduce the impact is to trace the primary and secondary contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases using contact tracing technology. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to survey strategies for digital contact tracing for the COVID-19 pandemic and to present how using mobile positioning data conforms with Nigeria's data privacy regulations. METHODS: We conducted an exploratory review of current measures for COVID-19 contact tracing implemented around the world. We then analyzed how countries are using mobile positioning data technology to reduce the spread of COVID-19. We made recommendations on how Nigeria can adopt this approach while adhering to the guidelines provided by the National Data Protection Regulation (NDPR). RESULTS: Despite the potential of digital contact tracing, it always conflicts with patient data privacy regulations. We found that Nigeria's response complies with the NDPR, and that it is possible to leverage call detail records to complement current strategies within the NDPR. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that mobile position data contact tracing is important for epidemic control as long as it conforms to relevant data privacy regulations. Implementation guidelines will limit data misuse.","Ekong, Iniobong; Chukwu, Emeka; Chukwu, Martha",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,,429

While millions of people were forced to stay home to reduce the spread of COVID-19 from March to July 2020, verbal artists posted recorded performances online and viewers had more time than usual to watch and share them. COVID verbal art refers to songs, poems, and comedy skits that mention social and physical distancing, quarantine and isolation, hygiene and cleaning practices, everyday experiences during the pandemic, as well as social and political critiques of policies and practices that explicitly mention COVID-19 or coronavirus. An examination of 227 verbal art performances posted on YouTube and TikTok provides an ethnographic record of how everyday life has changed over time during the COVID-19 pandemic, and how the focus shifted from initial confusion to political critique. © 2021 University of Toronto.

364425,Pc-facs,2020,"Young infants may be limited in searching for hidden objects because they lack the means-end motor skill to lift occluders from objects. This account was investigated by presenting 5- to 8-month-old infants with objects hidden behind transparent, semitransparent, and opaque curtains. If a means-end deficit explains search limitations, then infants should search no more for an object behind a transparent curtain than for objects behind semitransparent or opaque curtains. However, level of occlusion had a significant effect on manual search and visual attention. Infants retrieved and contacted the object more, contacted the curtain more, and looked away less with the transparent curtain than with the semi transparent or opaque curtains. Adding a time delay before allowing search and presenting a distraction after occlusion further depressed infants' behavior. The findings fail to support the means-end deficit hypothesis, but are consistent with the account that young infants lack object permanence.","Shinskey, Jeanne L; Bogartz, Richard S; Poirier, Christopher R",Infancy,,429

Epidemiology's social contract reflecting a dual commitment to science and health could arguably be entirely met by producing research results under conditions variously described as objective, impartial, neutral, independent and handing such results to decision makers and the public at large. However a closer examination shows that the four adjectives address sharply distinct issues, with distinct practical implications, and that the epidemiologist responsibility is 'de facto' involved beyond providing research results. Hence the epidemiologist's engagement should encompass arguing from a science-for-health viewpoint and proactively driving the results into decision processes on public health issues.","Saracci, Rodolfo",Am. j. epidemiol,,429

371046,Problems and solutions of personal protective equipment doffing in COVID-19,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic and the SARS-CoV-2 with its variants have posed unprecedented challenges worldwide. Existing vaccines have limited effectiveness against the SARS-CoV-2 variants. Therefore, novel vaccines to match current mutated viral lineages with long-term protective immunity are urgently in demand. In the current study, we for the first time designed a recombinant Adeno-Associated Virus 5 (rAAV5)-based vaccine named as rAAV-COVID-19 vaccine (Covacinplus) by using RBD-plus of spike protein with both the single-stranded and the self-complementary AAV5 delivering vectors (ssAAV5 and scAAAV5), which provides excellent protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection. A single dose vaccination induced the strong immune response against SARS-CoV-2. The induced neutralizing antibodies (NAs) titers were maintained at a high peak level of over 1:1024 even after more than one year of injection and accompanied with functional T-cells responses in mice. Importantly, both ssAAV- and scAAV-based RBD-plus vaccines exhibited high levels of serum NAs against current circulating variants including variants Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta. SARS-CoV-2 virus challenge test showed that ssAAV5-RBD-plus vaccine protected both young and old age mice from SARS-CoV-2 infection in the upper and the lower respiratory tracts. Moreover, whole genome sequencing demonstrated that AAV vector DNA sequences were not found in the genome of the vaccinated mice after one year vaccination, demonstrating excellent safety of the vaccine. Taken together, this study suggests that rAAV5-based vaccine is powerful against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants with long-term protective immunity and excellent safety, which has great potential for development into prophylactic vaccination in human to end this global pandemic.","Liao, Guochao; Fan, xing-xing; Lau, Hungyan; Liu, Zhongqiu; Li, Chinyu; Xu, Zeping; Zhang, Yu; Qi, Xiaoxiao; Li, Dan; Zhu, Qing; Chen, Liqing; ZHOU, Hua; Zhu, Sisi; Ke, Bixia; Pan, Hudan; Cong, Zhe; Li, Yongchao; Feng, Qian; Lv, Qi; Liu, Jiangning; Liang, Dan; Hong, Wenshan; Li, Yebo; Bao, Linlin; Zhou, Feng; Gao, Hongbin; liang, shi; Huang, Bihong; Wu, Miaoli; Qin, Chuan; Ke, Changwen; liu, liang",,,429

375332,Clinical and neurological factors in the formation of an individual predisposition to COVID-associated ischemic stroke,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The Covid-19 pandemic has required new protocols for endotracheal intubation mandating cumbersome personal protective equipment and modifications to prior intubation procedures. We assessed the success and complications of endotracheal intubation under such protocols. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of endotracheal intubation in the emergency department, intensive care unit, or ward between September 11, 2018 and June 11, 2020 at two urban hospitals. Using a standardized form, we included basic demographics, intubation techniques, and success, and pre-specified complications, defined as critical (cardiac arrest or failure to intubate) or non-critical. At both sites, Covid-19 intubation protocols took effect on March 11, 2020, and we compared pre-post patients. The primary outcome was first-pass success without complications. Secondary outcomes included first-pass success and complications. We analysed by descriptive techniques. RESULTS: Overall, we collected 1534 patients before March 11, 2020 and 227 after; groups were similar in age and sex distribution. Staff endotracheal intubation increased from 37 to 63%. First pass success was 1262/1534 (82.3%) pre versus 195/227 (85.9%) post, for a difference of 3.6% (95% CI - 1.8-8.0%). First pass success without complications was 1116/1534 (72.8%) pre versus 168/227 (74.0%) post, for a difference of 1.3%, (95% CI - 5.2-7.0%). There were 226 complications pre (14.7%) versus 47 (20.7%) post, for a difference of 6.0%. (95% CI 0.6-12.1%). CONCLUSIONS: New pandemic endotracheal intubation protocols did not result in a decrease in first-pass success, or first-pass success without complications.","Dullemond, Kia; Renschler, Colby; Trojanowski, Jan; Scheuermeyer, Frank; Stenstrom, Rob; Griesdale, Donald; MacRedmond, Ruth; Nattrass, Elan; Farina, Lena; Yoo, Jeff",CJEM,,429

METHODOLOGY: Our study included age and sex-based analysis of epidemiological data of infected and deceased patients from various countries. The patient data was graphically depicted with the slope's calculation to describe a gradual or steep spread of the disease along with subsequent rise or fall in the death reports. RESULTS: Population groups of 20-49 years of age and 50 years-above were highly vulnerable to infection. Interestingly, 20-49 years of age group was most affected in India. However, higher population of the deceased were reported in the 50 years-above in all countries. India and South Korea demonstrated a gradual appearance of COVID-19 positive cases than other countries illustrated by reduced slope %. Further the highest percentage of infected people and deaths were reported from the densely populated states of India. We observed a sex independent prevalence of COVID-19. The BCG and JE vaccine are unique in the vaccination regime of India and South Korea. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced ACE-2 expression in the children's nasal epithelium may be responsible for reduced SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility. Countries showed varying patterns in COVID-19 spread and associated mortality. It may be influenced by factors, such as screening strategy, countries demography, implementation of lockdown, etc. Due to limited evidence, it would be difficult to point to the influence of the virus on either sexes. Although vaccines may stimulate non-specific immunity, experimental proofs are needed to demonstrate the potential of any vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.","Jakhmola, Shweta; Baral, Budhadev; Jha, Hem Chandra",J Infect Dev Ctries,,429

The variable and occasionally rapid course of clinical disease raises safety concerns of using telemedicine in the clinical management of acute infection with the novel coronavirus. We present a case of novel coronavirus infection in an immunocompetent individual with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) who failed to manifest an adaptive immune response to acute infection and was subsequently reinfected. The case highlights the use of telemedicine in managing novel coronavirus respiratory disease and the potential role of OSA as a disease facilitator.","Sicsic, Isabelo; Chacon, Andres R; Zaw, Moe; Ascher, Kori; Abreu, Alexandre; Chediak, Alejandro",BMJ case reports,,429

A deep CNN architecture has been proposed in this paper for the diagnosis of COVID-19 based on the chest X-ray image classification. Due to the nonavailability of sufficient-size and good-quality chest X-ray image dataset, an effective and accurate CNN classification was a challenge. To deal with these complexities such as the availability of a very-small-sized and imbalanced dataset with image-quality issues, the dataset has been preprocessed in different phases using different techniques to achieve an effective training dataset for the proposed CNN model to attain its best performance. The preprocessing stages of the datasets performed in this study include dataset balancing, medical experts' image analysis, and data augmentation. The experimental results have shown the overall accuracy as high as 99.5% which demonstrates the good capability of the proposed CNN model in the current application domain. The CNN model has been tested in two scenarios. In the first scenario, the model has been tested using the 100 X-ray images of the original processed dataset which achieved an accuracy of 100%. In the second scenario, the model has been tested using an independent dataset of COVID-19 X-ray images. The performance in this test scenario was as high as 99.5%. To further prove that the proposed model outperforms other models, a comparative analysis has been done with some of the machine learning algorithms. The proposed model has outperformed all the models generally and specifically when the model testing was done using an independent testing set. © 2021 Aijaz Ahmad Reshi et al.","Reshi, A.

387557,Does personal protective equipment in the era of covid-19 influence quality of colonoscopy?,2021,"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease related mortality is the leading cause of death in the United States, with hypertension being the most prevalent and potent risk factor. For decades hypertension has disproportionately affected African Americans, who also have a higher burden of associated comorbidities including diabetes and heart failure. METHODS: Current literature including guideline reports and newer studies on hypertension in African Americans in PubMed were reviewed. We also reviewed newer publications on the relationship between COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease. FINDINGS: While APOL1 has been theorized in the epidemiology of hypertension, the increased prevalence and associated risks are primarily due to environmental and lifestyle factors. These factors include poor diet, adverse lifestyle, and social determinants. Hypertension control can be achieved by lifestyle modifications such as low sodium diet, weight loss, and adequate physical activity. When lifestyle modifications alone do not adequately control hypertension, a common occurrence among African Americans who suffer with greater prevalence of resistant hypertension, pharmacological intervention is indicated. The efficacy of renal denervation, and the use of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 and aminopeptidase A inhibitors, have been studied for treatment of resistant hypertension. Furthermore, the recent COVID-19 crisis has been particularly devastating among African Americans who demonstrate increased incidence and poorer health outcomes related to the disease. CONCLUSION: The disparities in outcomes, which are largely attributable to a greater prevalence of comorbidities such as hypertension and obesity, in addition to adverse environmental and socioeconomic factors, highlight the necessity of specialized clinical approaches and programs for African Americans to address longstanding barriers to equitable care.","Ferdinand, Keith; Batieste, Tivona; Fleurestil, Mashli",J Natl Med Assoc,,429

Methods: We conducted a thematic analysis on written reflections by neonatal nurses worldwide, exploring their experiences of COVID-19. Twenty-two reflections were analysed from eleven countries. Results: Thematic analysis revealed 4 main themes relating to the nurses' role: 1) protector 2) challenges to human quality of care 3) vulnerability and 4) resilience. The measures taken as protector were described as compromising the human qualities of care fundamental to their role. This tension, together with other new challenges, heightened feelings of vulnerability. Concurrently, nurses identified role resilience, including resourcefulness and peer support, which allowed them to navigate the global pandemic. Conclusion: By identifying global challenges and strategies to overcome these, neonatal nurses may be better equipped as the pandemic continues.

394118,Improving Tolerance to Snorkel Mask Use as Alternative Personal Protective Equipment,2021,"In the COVID-19 pandemic, among the more controversial issues is the use of face coverings. To address this we show that the underlying physics ensures particles with diameters&1 $\mu$m are efficiently filtered out by a simple cotton or surgical mask. For particles in the submicron range the efficiency depends on the material properties of the masks, though generally the filtration efficiency in this regime varies between 30 to 60 % and multi-layered cotton masks are expected to be comparable to surgical masks. Respiratory droplets are conventionally divided into coarse droplets (>5-10 $\mu$m) responsible for droplet transmission and aerosols (<5-10 $\mu$m) responsible for airborne transmission. Masks are thus expected to be highly effective at preventing droplet transmission, with their effectiveness limited only by the mask fit, compliance and appropriate usage. By contrast, knowledge of the size distribution of bioaerosols and the likelihood that they contain virus is essential to understanding their effectiveness in preventing airborne transmission. We argue from literature data on SARS-CoV-2 viral loads that the finest aerosols (<1 $\mu$m) are unlikely to contain even a single virion in the majority of cases; we thus expect masks to be effective at reducing the risk of airborne transmission in most settings.","Robinson, Joshua F.; Anda, Ioatzin Rios de; Moore, Fergus J.; Gregson, Florence K.

However, vaccine perception and acceptance among pregnant and lactating women is unknown in Singapore. We aimed to determine the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination among these two groups of women in Singapore, and factors associated with vaccine acceptance. MethodsWe conducted an anonymous, online survey on the perception and acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine in pregnant and lactating women at a tertiary hospital in Singapore from 1st March to 31st May 2021. Information on demographics and knowledge were collected, and these factors were assessed for their relationship with vaccine acceptance. ResultsA total of 201 pregnant and 207 lactating women participated. Vaccine acceptance rates in pregnant and lactating women were 30.3% and 16.9% respectively. Pregnant women who were unsure or unwilling to take the vaccine cited concerns about safety of the vaccine during pregnancy (92.9%), while lactating women were concerned about potential long-term negative effects on the breastfeeding child (75.6%). Other factors significantly associated with vaccine acceptance included a lower monthly household income or education level, appropriate knowledge regarding vaccine mechanism and higher perceived maternal risk of COVID-19. Most pregnant (70.0%) and lactating women (83.7%) were willing to take the vaccine only when more safety data during pregnancy and breastfeeding were available. ConclusionsCOVID-19 vaccine acceptance was low among pregnant and lactating women in Singapore. Addressing safety concerns when more data is available and education on mechanism of vaccine action will likely improve acceptance among these women.","Jayagobi, Pooja A; Ong, Chengsi; Yeo, Kee Thai; Lim, Caleb CW; Seet, Meei Jiun; Kwek, Lee Koon; Ku, Chee Wai; Chan, Jerry; Mathur, Manisha; Chua, Mei Chien",,,429

One option may be to deliver healthcare interventions remotely through digital healthcare solutions. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to bring together the evidence for remote healthcare during a quarantine situation period to support people living with cardiovascular disease during COVID-19 isolation. METHODS: The PubMed, CINAHL and Google Scholar were searched using telehealth OR digital health OR mHealth OR eHealth OR mobile apps AND COVID-19 OR quarantine search terms. We also searched for literature relating to cardiovascular disease AND quarantine. RESULTS: The literature search identified 45 potentially relevant publications, out of which nine articles were included. Three overarching themes emerged from this review: (1) preparing the workforce and ensuring reimbursement for remote healthcare, (2) supporting mental and physical health and (3) supporting usual care. CONCLUSION: To support people living with cardiovascular disease during COVID-19 isolation and to mitigate the effects of quarantine and adverse effect on mental and physical well-being, we should offer remote healthcare and provide access to their usual care.","Neubeck, Lis; Hansen, Tina; Jaarsma, Tiny; Klompstra, Leonie; Gallagher, Robyn",Eur J Cardiovasc Nurs,,429

While the level of adjustment made by partners to such activities is thought to contribute to a couple's sense of mutuality, perceptions of time use concerning activity engagement has yet to be considered. As such, this study will determine the level of perceptual congruence between partners with respect to perceived time use in their respective and shared activities. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of the IP-COUPLES study is to determine the similarities and differences between partners in terms of their perceptual congruence with respect to independent and jointly performed activities. This study will also examine the association between independent and joint activities in terms of perceptual congruence of time use and the strength of this association. METHODS: This descriptive observational study includes 100 couples from Western Switzerland who are recruited using snowball sampling methods. The Life Balance Inventory (LBI), a self-report questionnaire that captures activity configuration congruence, will measure independent and joint perceptions of both time use allocated to daily activities and corresponding satisfaction. Due to COVID-19, the protocol can be administered virtually by the primary investigator. The mean scores of perceptual congruence variables will be used for analysis, namely perceived congruence of time use in terms of independent and jointly performed activities. For the first objective, an independent t test will be used for each variable to compare the mean score between activities on the LBI. For the second objective, the correlations between the mean scores for these activities will be calculated for each variable using the Pearson correlation. RESULTS: The IP-COUPLES study protocol was developed in 2019 and 2020. Enrollment began in June 2020. Data collection will continue until October 2021 to account for time needed for recruitment due to the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. Analysis and presentation of results are expected in 2022. CONCLUSIONS: This study is exploratory, as it is the first to our knowledge to investigate how perceived time-use patterns with respect to independent or jointly performed activities are similar or different among romantic couples. By investigating the interpersonal perception of time-use patterns among couples, the IP-COUPLES study is an important first step to understanding how romantic partners' daily activities are contributing to the level of satisfaction as a partner and as a couple and to the sense of mutuality between partners in a romantic relationship.

408112,"Differential perceptions regarding personal protective equipment use during the COVID-19 pandemic by NHS healthcare professionals based on ethnicity, sex and professional experience",2021,"BACKGROUND: Serology tests can identify previous infections and facilitate estimation of the number of total infections. However, immunoglobulins targeting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been reported to wane below the detectable level of serologic assays (which is not necessarily equivalent to the duration of protective immunity). We estimate the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection from serology studies, accounting for expected levels of antibody acquisition (seroconversion) and waning (seroreversion), and apply this framework using data from New York City and Connecticut. METHODS: We estimated time from seroconversion to seroreversion and infection fatality ratio (IFR) using mortality data from March to October 2020 and population-level cross-sectional seroprevalence data from April to August 2020 in New York City and Connecticut. We then estimated the daily seroprevalence and cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: The estimated average time from seroconversion to seroreversion was 3-4 months. The estimated IFR was 1.1% (95% credible interval, 1.0%, 1.2%) in New York City and 1.4% (1.1, 1.7%) in Connecticut. The estimated daily seroprevalence declined after a peak in the spring. The estimated cumulative incidence reached 26.8% (24.2%, 29.7%) at the end of September in New York City and 8.8% (7.1%, 11.3%) in Connecticut, higher than maximum seroprevalence measures (22.1% and 6.1%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is underestimated using cross-sectional serology data without adjustment for waning antibodies. Our approach can help quantify the magnitude of underestimation and adjust estimates for waning antibodies.","Shioda, Kayoko; Lau, Max S Y; Kraay, Alicia N M; Nelson, Kristin N; Siegler, Aaron J; Sullivan, Patrick S; Collins, Matthew H; Weitz, Joshua S; Lopman, Benjamin A",Epidemiology,,429

In this case report, we described a case of SARS-CoV-2 infection with the clinical course for more than 2 months. This patient had recovered from pneumonia after treatment. The viral RNA of throat swabs became negative and the viral-specific antibodies were produced during the recovery period. However, the viral RNA reappeared and additionally persisted in throat swabs for more than 40 days. In addition, the viral RNA was detected in multiple types of specimens with extremely high titers in the saliva. In conclusion, these findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 can cause a long clinical course. The coexistence of viral RNA and viral-specific antibodies may imply an immune evasion of SARS-CoV-2 from the host's immune system.","Yang, Jian-Rong; Deng, Dao-Ting; Wu, Nan; Yang, Bin; Li, Hong-Juan; Pan, Xiao-Ben",J. med. virol,,429
408678,In reply: Personal protective equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic (Letters #1 and #2),2020,"Purpose: The COVID-19 outbreak has imposed extensive shocks embracing all stages of the food supply chain (FSC). Although the magnitude is still unfolding, the FSC responds with remarkable speed, to mitigate the disruptive consequences and sustain operations. This paper aims to investigate how operationalising supply chain agility (SCA) practices has occurred amid the COVID-19 crisis and expectations for how those practices could transform the supply chain in the post-COVID-19 era. Design/methodology/approach: Following an exploratory case-based design, this paper examines the various agile responses that three supply chains (meat, fresh vegetables and bread) adopted and elaborate using the dynamic capability (DC) theoretical lens. Findings: First, the findings demonstrate how, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, each affected case pursued various agile responses through sensing and seizing capabilities. Sensing includes identifying and assessing the relevant opportunities and threats associated with the specific supply chain context. Seizing involves acquiring, combining and modifying the tangible and intangible resources at the firm and supply chain levels. Second, supply chain transformation is likely if firms and their supply chain develop the sustaining capability to ensure that the desirable changes outlast the crisis. Practical implications: This study provides an actionable guide for practitioners to develop agile responses to systemic changes in times of crisis and to sustain favourable changes so as to enable their outlasting of the crisis. Originality/value: This study provides a novel and unique perspective on the role of SCA in crisis – in this case, the pandemic. This paper synthesises the empirical stories of the agile responses in the FSC and elaborates on the DC framework, to identify theoretical and practical implications. This paper establishes the sustaining capability as the missing DC capability for enabling transformation in the post-COVID-19 era. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Do, Q.

Urology Virtual clinics (VCs) were initiated at our institution to ensure continued provision of service during the pandemic. The study aim was to analyse outcomes and cost-effectiveness of VCs compared to pre-COVID- 19 face-to face (F2F) clinics. Method: We retrospectively analysed the VCs from 18th March 2020 to 1st July 2020 and compared them to F2F clinics in the same period in 2019. Clinical outcomes were compared, and potential financial savings were estimated to see if VCs can be incorporated into future practice. Results: 1317 patients were reviewed in 2020 as compared to 1941 in 2019. We noted similar rates of discharges [25.4% (2020) v/s 24.1% (2019)], follow-ups (48.7% (2020) v/s 48.4% (2019)] and patients who did not attend/answer (6.8% (2020) v/s 6.6% (2019)]. Potentially, over £100,000 can be saved by changing 50% appointments to VCs. Conclusions: Our data shows that VCs are non-inferior to F2F clinics and have allowed continued effective service provision during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is potential to incorporate VCs into future practice without compromising on efficacy. Further data collection and analysis is ongoing at our institution on a larger scale.","Hassanzadeh-Baboli, D.; Pavithran, A.; Khawaja, I.; Maan, Z.; Deshpande, A.",British Journal of Surgery,,429

ACE2 is shed to the circulation, and a higher plasma level of soluble ACE2 (sACE2) might reflect a higher cellular expression of ACE2. The present study explored the associations between sACE2 and clinical factors, cardiovascular biomarkers, and genetic variability. METHODS AND RESULTS: Plasma and DNA samples were obtained from two international cohorts of elderly patients with atrial fibrillation (n = 3999 and n = 1088). The sACE2 protein level was measured by the Olink Proteomics® Multiplex CVD II96 × 96 panel. Levels of the biomarkers high-sensitive cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT), N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15), C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, D-dimer, and cystatin-C were determined by immunoassays. Genome-wide association studies were performed by Illumina chips. Higher levels of sACE2 were statistically significantly associated with male sex, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and older age. The sACE2 level was most strongly associated with the levels of GDF-15, NT-proBNP, and hs-cTnT. When adjusting for these biomarkers, only male sex remained associated with sACE2. We found no statistically significant genetic regulation of the sACE2 level. CONCLUSIONS: Male sex and clinical or biomarker indicators of biological ageing, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes are associated with higher sACE2 levels. The levels of GDF-15 and NT-proBNP, which are associated both with the sACE2 level and a higher risk for mortality and cardiovascular disease, might contribute to better identification of risk for severe COVID-19 infection.","Wallentin, Lars; Lindbäck, Johan; Eriksson, Niclas; Hijazi, Ziad; Eikelboom, John W; Ezekowitz, Michael D; Granger, Christopher B; Lopes, Renato D; Yusuf, Salim; Oldgren, Jonas; Siegbahn, Agneta",Eur Heart J,,429
413249,Prediction of Personal Protective Equipment Use in Hospitals During COVID-19,2020-10-29,"Light exposure at night has various implications for human health, but little is known about its effects on energy metabolism during subsequent sleep. We investigated the effects of polychromatic white light using conventional light-emitting diodes (LED) and an alternative light source, organic light-emitting diodes (OLED), producing reduced spectral content in the short wavelength of blue light (455 nm). Ten male participants were exposed to either LED, OLED (1000 lx), or dim (< 10 lx) light for 4 h before sleep in a metabolic chamber. Following OLED exposure, energy expenditure and core body temperature during sleep were significantly decreased (p < 0.001). Fat oxidation during sleep was significantly reduced (p = 0.001) after the exposure to LED compared with OLED. Following exposure to OLED, fat oxidation positively correlated with the 6-sulfatoxymelatonin levels, suggesting that the role of melatonin in lipolysis differs depending on the light. These findings advance our knowledge regarding the role of light in energy metabolism during sleep and provide a potential alternative to mitigate the negative consequences of light exposure at night.","Ishihara, Asuka; Park, Insung; Suzuki, Yoko; Yajima, Katsuhiko; Cui, Huiyun; Yanagisawa, Masashi; Sano, Takeshi; Kido, Junji; Tokuyama, Kumpei",Sci Rep,,429

METHODS: We reviewed the demographic characteristics, laboratory abnormalities, radiological features, and treatments of 7 patients with nocardiosis and glomerular disease receiving steroids and immunosuppression therapy at the nephrology department of the Second Xiangya Hospital between 2012 and 2019. RESULTS: It was found that all 7 patients had been receiving methylprednisolone for renal disease at a median dose of 20 mg per day and a median duration of 4 months before developing nocardiosis. There were 4 males and 3 females, and the median age was 52.14 years. All 7 patients had hypoalbuminemia at the time of admission. In addition, various cystic abscesses in the subcutaneous tissue, with or without lung and brain involvement, were observed in these patients. Encouragingly, body temperatures returned to normal, and subcutaneous abscesses diminished or disappeared with compound sulfamethoxazole treatment alone or in combination with linezolid, imipenem and mezlocillin/sulbactam. CONCLUSIONS: It was shown that multisite abscesses, including subcutaneous, pulmonary and cerebral abscesses, were the common manifestations of nocardiosis in glomerular disease patients. Sulfonamide was the first-line antibiotic therapy for nocardiosis, and combinations of other antibiotics were also needed in some serious cases.","Han, Yuzhang; Huang, Zineng; Zhang, Huifang; He, Liyu; Sun, Lin; Liu, Yu; Liu, Fuyou; Xiao, Li",BMC Nephrol,,429
416984,The right to clothing and personal protective equipment in the context of COVID-19,2021,"Introduction: Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) quickly evolved into a global pandemic in early 2020, and most countries enforced social confinements to reduce transmission. This seems to dovetail with increasing, potentially problematic, screen use habits, such as gaming and ""binge-watching."" Yet, the subjective experience of the common confinements may vary not only between individuals depending on age, sex, and living conditions (i.e., living alone) but also within individuals from day to day: confinements might interfere with habitual activity schedules more strongly on some days than on others. Such dynamic confinement experience has not been studied in relation to screen use yet but might guide targeted intervention. Method: In total, 102 participants (n = 83 female, n = 80 university students) completed 14 days of ecological momentary assessment during a COVID-19-related lockdown in Germany and Austria. Each evening, they indicated the extent to which they felt restricted by confinements in their social and work lives and whether they engaged in unusually high and intense levels of television watching, social media use, news consumption, internet surfing, and gaming. They also reported on how much they experienced their day to be structured. Results: Experienced work confinements were positively associated with social media usage. Further, work confinements were positively associated with gaming in males and with news consumption, especially in individuals living alone. Social confinements were positively associated with watching television especially in younger participants and with social media consumption in younger participants. Higher experienced day structure was related to less television watching, gaming, and internet surfing but more news consumption. Discussion: Screen use behaviors increased with higher confinements within person, dependent on sex, age, and living situation. Such knowledge allows tailoring on the person level (who should be addressed?) and the time level (when should interventions be scheduled?) as the negative consequences of excessive screen use behaviors on mental and physical health are well-documented. One potential low-threshold intervention might be day-structuring.","Arend, Ann-Kathrin; Blechert, Jens; Pannicke, Björn; Reichenberger, Julia",Front Public Health,,429

However, the mechanisms of host response to N. bombycis remain unclear. STING (stimulator of interferon genes) is an adapter protein involved in the innate immune response to pathogens. In this study, a transgenic gRNA vector containing BmSTING was constructed and microinjected to generate the transgenic line BmSTING&#916;6bp/WT and BmSTING&#916;5bp/WT in silkworms. The expression of BmSTING was significantly reduced in BmSTING&#916;5bp/WT compared to non-transgenic silkworm. The mortality and LC3 level in BmSTING&#916;6bp/WT and BmSTING&#916;5bp/WT was significantly decreased in the early infection stage of N. bombycis, but the transgenic silkworms died rapidly in the later stage. Furthermore, both BmSTING and LC3 were increased in BmE cell lines after infection with N. bombycis.

In 2016, more than 276 million cases of neurological disorders were reported worldwide. Moreover, neurological disorders are the second leading cause of death. Generally, the etiology of neurological diseases is not fully understood. Recent studies have related the onset of neurological disorders to viral infections, which may cause neurological symptoms or lead to immune responses that trigger these pathological signs. Currently, this relationship is mostly based on epidemiological data on infections and seroprevalence of patients who present with neurological disorders. The number of studies aiming to elucidate the mechanism of action by which viral infections may directly or indirectly contribute to the development of neurological disorders has been increasing over the years but these studies are still scarce. Comprehending the pathogenesis of these diseases and exploring novel theories may favor the development of new strategies for diagnosis and therapy in the future. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to review the main pieces of evidence for the relationship between viral infection and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Guillain-Barré syndrome, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy. Viruses belonging to the families Herpesviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Flaviviridae, and Retroviridae have been reported to be involved in one or more of these conditions. Also, neurological symptoms and the future impact of infection with SARS-CoV-2, a member of the family Coronaviridae that is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic that started in late 2019, are reported and discussed.","Wouk, Jéssica; Rechenchoski, Daniele Zendrini; Rodrigues, Bianca Cerqueira Dias; Ribelato, Elisa Vicente; Faccin-Galhardi, Ligia Carla",Arch. virol,,429

COVID-19 patients with ESKD need isolation dialysis, but most of them cannot be handled in time due to limited continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) machines. CRRT provided benefits for this patient by removing potentially damaging toxins and stabilizing his metabolic and hemodynamic status. With the control of uremia and fluid status, this patient ended up with an uneventful post-CRRT course, absence of clinical symptoms, and negative PCR tests.

METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 underwent non-invasive evaluation of systemic endothelium-dependent microvascular reactivity - using laser Doppler perfusion monitoring in the skin of the forearm - coupled to local thermal hyperemia. Maximal microvascular vasodilatation (44 °C thermal plateau phase) was used as endpoint. A multiplex biometric immunoassay was used to assess a panel of 48 serum cytokines and chemokines. Severe COVID-19 (S-COVID) was defined according to WHO criteria, while all other cases of COVID-19 were considered mild to moderate (M-COVID). A group of healthy individuals who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 served as a control group and was also evaluated with LDPM. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients with COVID-19 (25% S-COVID) and 14 controls were included. Basal microvascular flow was similar between M-COVID and controls (P = 0.69) but was higher in S-COVID than in controls (P = 0.005) and M-COVID patients (P = 0.01). The peak microvascular vasodilator response was markedly decreased in both patient groups (M-COVID, P = 0.001; S-COVID, P < 0.0001) compared to the healthy group. The percent increases in microvascular flow were markedly reduced in both patient groups (M-COVID, P < 0.0001; S-COVID, P < 0.0001) compared to controls. Patients with S-COVID had markedly higher concentrations of dissimilar proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, compared to patients with M-COVID. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with COVID-19, especially with S-COVID, endothelium-dependent microvascular vasodilator responses are reduced, while serum cytokines and chemokines involved in the regulation of vascular function and inflammation are increased.","Sabioni, Letícia; De Lorenzo, Andrea; Lamas, Cristiane; Muccillo, Fabiana; Castro-Faria-Neto, Hugo Caire; Estato, Vanessa; Tibirica, Eduardo",Microvasc Res,,429

In the present study, we examined the provision of stroke care in Kobe City during the COVID-19 epidemic, where some major stroke centers ceased to provide emergency care. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study. The Kobe Stroke Network surveyed the number of stroke patients admitted to all primary stroke centers (PSCs) in the city between March 1 and May 23, 2020, and between March 3 and May 25, 2019. In addition, online meetings between all PSC directors were held regularly to share information. The survey items included emergency response system characteristics, number of patients with stroke hospitalized within 7 days of onset, administered treatment types (IV rt-PA, mechanical thrombectomy, surgery, and endovascular therapy), and stroke patients with confirmed COVID-19. RESULTS: During the period of interest in 2020, the number of stroke patients hospitalized across 13 PSCs was 813, which was 15.5% lower than that during the same period of 2019 (pâ¯=â¯0.285). The number of patients admitted with cerebral infarction, intracerebral hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage decreased by 15.4% (pâ¯=â¯0.245), 16.1% (p = 0.659), and 14.0% (pâ¯=â¯0.715), respectively. However, the rates of mechanical thrombectomy and surgery for intracerebral hemorrhage were slightly increased by 12.1% (pâ¯=â¯0.754) and 5.0% (pâ¯=â¯0.538), respectively. PSCs that ceased to provide emergency care reported a decrease in the number of stroke cases of 65.7% compared with the same period in 2019, while other PSCs reported an increase of 0.8%. No case of a patient with stroke and confirmed COVID-19 was reported during the study period. CONCLUSION: Kobe City was able to maintain operation of its stroke care systems thanks to close cooperation among all city PSCs and a temporal decrease in the total number of stroke cases.","Ohara, Nobuyuki; Imamura, Hirotoshi; Adachi, Hidemitsu; Hara, Yoshie; Hosoda, Kohkichi; Kimura, Hidehito; Kuwayama, Kazuyuki; Mizowaki, Takashi; Motooka, Yasuhiko; Nakashima, Kazuya; Shinoda, Narihide; Takamoto, Takeshi; Ueno, Yasushi; Yamaura, Ikuya; Yanagihara, Chie; Yoshida, Yasuhisa; Kawamoto, Michi; Sakai, Nobuyuki",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,,429

We sought to develop guidance for procurement and use of CCP, particularly in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) for which data are lacking. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multidisciplinary, geographically representative group of individuals with expertise spanning transfusion medicine, infectious diseases and hematology was tasked with the development of a guidance document for CCP, drawing on expert opinion, survey of group members and review of available evidence. Three subgroups (i.e. donor, product and patient) were established based on self-identified expertise and interest. Here, the donor and product-related challenges are summarized and contrasted between HICs and LMICs with a view to guide related practices. RESULTS: The challenges to advance CCP therapy are different between HICs and LMICs. Early challenges in HICs related to recruitment and qualification of sufficient donors to meet the growing demand. Antibody testing also posed a specific obstacle given lack of standardization, variable performance of the assays in use and uncertain interpretation of results. In LMICs, an extant transfusion deficit, suboptimal models of donor recruitment (e.g. reliance on replacement and paid donors), limited laboratory capacity for pre-donation qualification and operational considerations could impede wide adoption. CONCLUSION: There has been wide scale adoption of CCP in many HICs, which could increase if clinical trials show efficacy of use. By contrast, LMICs, having received little attention, require locally applicable strategies for adoption of CCP.","Bloch, Evan M; Goel, Ruchika; Wendel, Silvano; Burnouf, Thierry; Al-Riyami, Arwa Z; Ang, Ai Leen; DeAngelis, Vincenzo; Dumont, Larry J; Land, Kevin; Lee, Cheuk-Kwong; Oreh, Adaeze; Patidar, Gopal; Spitalnik, Steven L; Vermeulen, Marion; Hindawi, Salwa; Van den Berg, Karin; Tiberghien, Pierre; Vrielink, Hans; Young, Pampee; Devine, Dana; So-Osman, Cynthia",Vox sang,,429

Due to inherent sequence length limits of these models, they need to be run over a document's passages, rather than processing the entire document sequence at once. Although several approaches for aggregating passage-level signals have been proposed, there has yet to be an extensive comparison of these techniques. In this work, we explore strategies for aggregating relevance signals from a document's passages into a final ranking score. We find that passage representation aggregation techniques can significantly improve over techniques proposed in prior work, such as taking the maximum passage score. We call this new approach PARADE. In particular, PARADE can significantly improve results on collections with broad information needs where relevance signals can be spread throughout the document (such as TREC Robust04 and GOV2). Meanwhile, less complex aggregation techniques may work better on collections with an information need that can often be pinpointed to a single passage (such as TREC DL and TREC Genomics).

Data on the mobility level of patients with COVID-19 in the intensive care unit (ICU) are needed. OBJECTIVE: To describe the mobility level of patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU and to address factors associated with mobility level at the time of ICU discharge. METHODS: Single center, retrospective cohort study. Consecutive patients admitted to the ICU with confirmed COVID-19 infection were analyzed. The mobility status was assessed by the Perme Score at admission and discharge from ICU with higher scores indicating higher mobility level. The Perme Mobility Index (PMI) was calculated [PMI = &#916;Perme Score (ICU discharge-ICU admission)/ICU length of stay]. Based on the PMI, patients were divided into two groups: ""Improved"" (PMI > 0) and ""Not improved"" (PMI &#8804; 0). RESULTS: A total of 136 patients were included in this analysis. The hospital mortality rate was 16.2%. The Perme Score improved significantly when comparing ICU discharge with ICU admission [20.0 (7-28) points versus 7.0 (0-16) points; P < 0.001]. A total of 88 patients (64.7%) improved their mobility level during ICU stay, and the median PMI of these patients was 1.5 (0.6-3.4). Patients in the improved group had a lower duration of mechanical ventilation [10 (5-14) days versus 15 (8-24) days; P = 0.021], lower hospital length of stay [25 (12-37) days versus 30 (11-48) days; P < 0.001], and lower ICU and hospital mortality rate. Independent predictors for mobility level were lower age, lower Charlson Comorbidity Index, and not having received renal replacement therapy. CONCLUSION: Patients' mobility level was low at ICU admission; however, most patients improved their mobility level during ICU stay. Risk factors associated with the mobility level were age, comorbidities, and use of renal replacement therapy.","Timenetsky, Karina Tavares; Serpa Neto, Ary; Lazarin, Ana Carolina; Pardini, Andreia; Moreira, Carla Regina Sousa; Corrêa, Thiago Domingos; Caserta Eid, Raquel Afonso; Nawa, Ricardo Kenji",PLoS One,,429

454102,Curating the Evidence on Role of Personal Protective Equipment in COVID-19: A Review of Scientific Publications and Social Media Recommendations (preprint),2020,"Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is uncontrolled in many parts of the world; control is compounded in some areas by the higher transmission potential of the B.1.1.7 variant1, which has now been reported in 94 countries. It is unclear whether the response of the virus to vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 on the basis of the prototypic strain will be affected by the mutations found in B.1.1.7. Here we assess the immune responses of individuals after vaccination with the mRNA-based vaccine BNT162b22. We measured neutralizing antibody responses after the first and second immunizations using pseudoviruses that expressed the wild-type spike protein or a mutated spike protein that contained the eight amino acid changes found in the B.1.1.7 variant. The sera from individuals who received the vaccine exhibited a broad range of neutralizing titres against the wild-type pseudoviruses that were modestly reduced against the B.1.1.7 variant. This reduction was also evident in sera from some patients who had recovered from COVID-19. Decreased neutralization of the B.1.1.7 variant was also observed for monoclonal antibodies that target the N-terminal domain (9 out of 10) and the receptor-binding motif (5 out of 31), but not for monoclonal antibodies that recognize the receptor-binding domain that bind outside the receptor-binding motif. Introduction of the mutation that encodes the E484K substitution in the B.1.1.7 background to reflect a newly emerged variant of concern (VOC 202102/02) led to a more-substantial loss of neutralizing activity by vaccine-elicited antibodies and monoclonal antibodies (19 out of 31) compared with the loss of neutralizing activity conferred by the mutations in B.1.1.7 alone. The emergence of the E484K substitution in a B.1.1.7 background represents a threat to the efficacy of the BNT162b2 vaccine.","Collier, Dami A; De Marco, Anna; Ferreira, Isabella A T M; Meng, Bo; Datir, Rawlings P; Walls, Alexandra C; Kemp, Steven A; Bassi, Jessica; Pinto, Dora; Silacci-Fregni, Chiara; Bianchi, Siro; Tortorici, M Alejandra; Bowen, John; Culap, Katja; Jaconi, Stefano; Cameroni, Elisabetta; Snell, Gyorgy; Pizzuto, Matteo S; Pellanda, Alessandra Franzetti; Garzoni, Christian; Riva, Agostino; Elmer, Anne; Kingston, Nathalie; Graves, Barbara; McCoy, Laura E; Smith, Kenneth G C; Bradley, John R; Temperton, Nigel; Ceron-Gutierrez, Lourdes; Barcenas-Morales, Gabriela; Harvey, William; Virgin, Herbert W; Lanzavecchia, Antonio; Piccoli, Luca; Doffinger, Rainer; Wills, Mark; Veesler, David; Corti, Davide; Gupta, Ravindra K",Nature,,429

459774,The Impact of COVID-19 on Essential Medicines and Personal Protective Equipment Availability and Prices in Saudi Arabia,2021,"COVID-19 vaccination resistance has become a major challenge to prevent global SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Here we report that the vaccination coverage rate is inversely correlated to the mutation frequency of the full genome (R2=0.878) and spike gene (R2=0.829) of SARS-CoV-2 delta variants in 16 countries, suggesting that full vaccination against COVID-19, with other mitigation strategies, is critical to suppress emergent mutations. Neutrality analysis of DH and Zeng E tests suggested that directional selection was the major driving force of delta variant evolution. To eliminate the homogenous effects (population expansion, selective sweep etc.), the synonymous (Dsyn) and nonsynonymous (Dnonsyn) polymorphisms of the delta variant spike gene were estimated with Tajima D statistic. Both D ratio (Dnonsyn/Dsyn) and deltaD (Dsyn-Dnonsyn) have positive correlation with the full vaccination rate (R2= 0.723 and 0.505, respectively) in 19 countries, indicating that purifying selection pressure of SARS-CoV-2 spike gene increased as the vaccination coverage rate increased. Taken together, our data suggests that vaccination plays an important role in the purifying selection force of spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 delta variants.","Yeh, Ting-Yu; Contreras, Gregory P.",,,429

The present survey aimed to provide a European overview on the COVID-19 impact on surgical oncology. METHODS: This anonymous online survey was accessible from April 24 to May 11, 2020, for surgeons (n = 298) who were contacted by the surgical society European Digestive Surgery. The survey was completed by 88 surgeons (29.2%) from 69 different departments. The responses per department were evaluated. RESULTS: Of the departments, 88.4% (n = 61/69) reported a lower volume of patients in the outpatient clinic; 69.1% (n = 47/68) and 75.0% (n = 51/68) reported a reduction in hospital bed and the operating room capacity, respectively. As a result, the participants reported an average reduction of 29.3% for all types of oncological resections surveyed in this questionnaire. The strongest reduction was observed for oncological resections of hepato-pancreatico-biliary (HPB) cancers. Of the interviewed surgeons, 68.7% (n = 46/67) agreed that survival outcomes will be negatively impacted by the pandemic. CONCLUSION: The first COVID-19 pandemic wave had a significant impact on surgical oncology in Europe. The surveyed surgeons expect an increase in the number of unresectable cancers as well as poorer survival outcomes due to cancellations of follow-ups and postponements of surgeries.","Stöss, Christian; Steffani, Marcella; Pergolini, Ilaria; Hartmann, Daniel; Radenkovic, Dejan; Novotny, Alexander; Friess, Helmut; Müller, Michael W",Dig Surg,,429

Therefore, we performed this meta-analysis to further investigate whether TNF-&#945; variants are related to AKI susceptibility. Methods: A comprehensive search of observational studies on the association of TNF-&#945; polymorphism with AKI susceptibility was conducted in the PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase databases through February 10, 2020. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% corresponding confidence intervals (95% CIs) were analyzed to evaluate the strength of the relationship. Results: A total of 8 studies involving 6694 patients (2559 cases and 4135 controls) were included. Pooled analysis showed a trend of increased risk between the TNF-&#945; rs1800629 variant and AKI (A vs. G: OR [95%CI] = 1.33 [0.98-1.81]) among the overall population. Ethnicity-stratified analysis indicated that the TNF-&#945; rs1800629 variant was a risk factor for Asians (OR [95%CI] = 1.93 [1.59-2.35]) while it is not for Caucasians (OR [95%CI] = 1.04 [0.91-1.20]). Additionally, we also found that TNF-&#945; rs1799964 polymorphism was observed to have a significant relationship with AKI risk in Asian patients (C vs. T, OR [95%CI] = 1.26 [1.11-1.43]). Conclusions: The TNF rs1800629 polymorphism exhibited a trend toward AKI susceptibility with ethnic differences. The relationship was found to be significant among the Asian population, but not among those of Caucasian origin. Additionally, the TNF-&#945; rs1799964 polymorphism was also related to a significantly increased risk of AKI in Asians.","Chen, Guanzhong; Liu, Bowen; Li, Huanqiang; Mai, Ziling; Zhang, Liyao; Li, Min; Liu, Liwei; Chen, Shiqun; Chen, Jiyan; Liu, Yong",Biomed Res Int,,429

467713,Sourcing Personal Protective Equipment During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"The globalization of the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic impacts is set to run havoc across economies in the world, throwing many into recession and possibly depression. The aim of this paper is to provide an overall understanding of the likely macroeconomic shocks of the pandemic on a diverse range of economic activities and indicators across economies. The paper covers implications to demand, supply, supply chain, trade, investment, price level, exchange rates, and financial stability and risk, growth, and international cooperation. The paper combines a unique theoretical impact mapping and supplements it with emerging evidence to develop the impacts’ likely progression and span. Furthermore, the paper uses a standard Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply (AD-AS) model of macroeconomics to explain the likely growth effects arising out of essential and nonessential goods markets and outlines necessary features policy responses should consider. Data and information to analyze the impacts are assimilated from different sources, including news and media publications, the OECD, and IHS Markit-CIPS. Assessments of this paper suggest that many economies are about to see a period of stagflation driven by demand and supply slump, increased unemployment, deflationary pressure, reduced trade flows, and disruptions in the supply chain, which may result in a recessionary period if not acted fast with innovative policy responses. As almost all economies are badly affected, a global growth recession is imminent if the pandemic continues. However, based on past experience of pandemics and epidemics and the current evidence, a U-shaped recovery pattern is the most optimistic possibility for most countries and the world economy. The paper could help policy-makers in understanding the pandemic’s broad-based impacts and policy needs to fight the imminent economic damage. Particularly, assessments with respect to the essential and non-essential goods markets could provide useful insights in designing appropriate policy responses to fight the pandemic. All considered, the paper calls for a collective and globalized response alongside standalone policy responses undertaken by individual economies. The assessments are broadly in line with the limited literature available on macroeconomic implications of CVODI-19 and could serve as a basis for advanced analysis on COVID-19 economics.

TOs were reached through phone calls, emails, and virtual sources as face-to-face interviews were not possible due to COVID-19 pandemic and restrictions on travel by the government. In-depth interviews were conducted to gather data. Results suggest that the TOs although realize the importance of social, environmental, and economic dimensions of tourism on the communities but have no management systems in place to cater accordingly.

The TOs do not select a destination based on Global Sustainable Tourism Council criterion, but rather the selection of destination is mostly demand-based and profit-oriented.

Cirrhotic subjects consecutively referring to eight Italian centers were prospectively enrolled for a 6-month period in 2019. Subjects were asked if they had received a flu vaccine in the last 12 months. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of lack of vaccination. A total of 818 cases were recruited. The overall vaccine coverage was 39.6% (26.9% in those younger than 65 years and 51.9% in those older than 64 years; p < 0.001). Age < 65 years (odds ratio [OR] = 2.38; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.68-3.36), alcoholic etiology (OR = 2.40; 95% CI = 1.49-3.85), birth abroad (OR = 2.7; 95% CI = 1.10-6.61), and residence in South/Sardinia island (OR = 1.66; 95% CI = 1.14-2.42) all resulted independent predictors of the likelihood of lack of vaccination. The lack of information regarding the vaccine as the reason for no vaccination was reported by 71.4% of foreigners and by 34.7% of natives (p < 0.001).

The risk factors for depression included drinking (p = 0.04; adjusted OR = 2.81, 95%CI: 1.26~6.24), nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (p < 0.001; adjusted OR = 3.54, 95%CI: 1.10~11.44), pregnancy's influence on mobility (p = 0.02; adjusted OR = 1.42, 95%CI: 1.11~1.83), anxiety (p < 0.001; adjusted OR = 1.66, 95%CI: 1.57~1.75), insomnia (p < 0.001; adjusted OR = 1.17, 95%CI: 1.14~1.21) and daily attention to fetal movement (p < 0.001; adjusted OR = 0.41, 95%CI: 0.31~0.56). LIMITATIONS: This study used a cross-sectional design, and cannot compare changes in the incidence of depression before and after the COVID-19 outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 outbreak, the prevalence rate of depression among Chinese prenatal and postnatal women was 35.4%. Moreover, anxiety, insomnia, drinking, nausea and vomiting during pregnancy, as well as the impaired movement and less daily monitoring of fetal movement were risk factors for depression.","Li, Chuanxiao; Huo, Lijuan; Wang, Ruoxi; Qi, Ling; Wang, Wenjia; Zhou, Xin; Zhou, Yongjie; Zhang, Xiangyang",J Affect Disord,,429

Under these unprecedented circumstances, there are no well-established guidelines for cancer patients. RECENT FINDINGS: The risk for serious disease and death in COVID-19 cases increases with advancing age and presence of comorbid health conditions. Since the emergence of the first case in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, tremendous research efforts have been underway to understand the mechanisms of infectivity and transmissibility of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), a fatal virus responsible for abysmal survival outcomes. To minimize the mortality rate, it becomes prudent to identify symptoms promptly and employ treatments appropriately. Even though no cure has been established, multiple clinical trials are underway to determine the most optimal strategy. Managing cancer patients under these circumstances is rather challenging, given their vulnerable status and the aggressive nature of their underlying disease. In this comprehensive review, we discuss the impact of COVID-19 on health and the immune system of those affected, reviewing the latest treatment approaches and ongoing clinical trials. Additionally, we discuss challenges faced while treating cancer patients and propose potential approaches to manage this vulnerable population during this pandemic.","Gosain, Rohit; Abdou, Yara; Singh, Abhay; Rana, Navpreet; Puzanov, Igor; Ernstoff, Marc S",Curr Oncol Rep,,429
484516,Bereavement Support on the Frontline of COVID-19: Recommendations for Hospital Clinicians,2020,"Within otolaryngology, scribes have been utilized as a means of increasing clinic efficiency and easing workload on physicians. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a majority of otolaryngology clinic appointments at academic institutions have been moved to telemedicine in order to limit interpersonal contacts. At the height of the pandemic, our institution has protocolized scribe participation from in-person to remote. Scribes have virtually participated in telemedicine appointments in an effort to facilitate documentation and enhance the patient-physician relationship. Beyond the pandemic, as patients start being evaluated in-person, the risk of contamination and spread through aerosol generating procedures has limited the number of ancillary support staff that can be present in the examination rooms. As such, virtual scribing from a separate location within the clinic has been deemed warranted. This paper documents the protocols on virtual scribing for both telemedicine and a hybrid approach for in-clinic appointments where high-risk procedures are being performed.","Noordzij, Renee; Plocienniczak, Michal J; Brook, Christopher",Am J Otolaryngol,,429

Currently, re-purposing of existing drugs is the only therapeutic option for managing COVID-19 symptoms and associated co-infections to reduce mortality. Antimicrobials as varied as antiparasitic, antiviral, and antibiotics are under various stages of evaluation. Areas covered: Recently, doxycycline, a broad-spectrum antibiotic that has also reported antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties was widely investigated in clinical trials, either alone or in combination with other drugs, and repurposed for COVID-19 treatment. In the review, the potential therapeutic applications of doxycycline in COVID-19 treatment and its potential adverse implications with respect to antimicrobial resistance bestowed by repurposing the antibiotic have been expounded. Expert opinion: 'Fighting disease with already existing antibiotics' and 'antimicrobial resistance progression' are like two arms of a balance that has to be carefully equilibrated. Any imbalance by the inappropriate or indiscriminate use of the repurposed drugs would cause a disastrous increase in antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Hence, cautious parallel assessment of potential long-term consequences of AMR is of great importance to mankind as its impacts would prevail even after the current pandemic.","Narendrakumar, Lekshmi; Joseph, Iype; Thomas, Sabu",Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther,,429
487923,Understanding the genetic contribution of the human leukocyte antigen system to common major psychiatric disorders in a world pandemic context,2020,"Hormesis refers to a nonmonotonic (biphasic) dose-response relationship in toxicology, environmental science, and related fields. In the presence of hormesis, a low dose of a toxic agent may have a lower risk than the risk at the control dose, and the risk may increase at high doses. When the sample size is small due to practical, logistic, and ethical considerations, a parametric model may provide an efficient approach to hypothesis testing at the cost of adopting a strong assumption, which is not guaranteed to be true. In this article, we first consider alternative parameterizations based on the traditional three-parameter logistic regression. The new parameterizations attempt to provide robustness to model misspecification by allowing an unspecified dose-response relationship between the control dose and the first nonzero experimental dose. We then consider experimental designs including the uniform design (the same sample size per dose group) and the c -optimal design (minimizing the standard error of an estimator for a parameter of interest). Our simulation studies showed that (1) the c -optimal design under the traditional three-parameter logistic regression does not help reducing an inflated Type I error rate due to model misspecification, (2) it is helpful under the new parameterization with three parameters (Type I error rate is close to a fixed significance level), and (3) the new parameterization with four parameters and the c -optimal design does not reduce statistical power much while preserving the Type I error rate at a fixed significance level.","Kim, Steven; Wand, Jeffrey; Magana-Ramirez, Christina; Fraij, Jenel",Risk anal,,429

A retrospective, uncontrolled, cross-sectional study of 31 Lassa fever survivors (62 eyes) who underwent an ophthalmic evaluation in January 2018 at the Kenema Government Hospital in Kenema, Sierra Leone was performed. Data collection included demographic information, ocular/systemic symptoms, visual acuity (VA), and ophthalmic examination findings. Main outcome measures included anterior and posterior segment ophthalmic manifestations and level of VA impairment in Lassa fever survivors. Anterior segment findings included cataract (18%) and pterygium (2%), while posterior segment manifestations consisted of glaucoma (6%), preretinal hemorrhage (2%), and lattice degeneration (2%). Findings suggestive of prior sequelae of uveitis included chorioretinal scarring (5%), retinal fibrosis (3%), and vitreous opacity (2%). Visual acuity was normal/mildly impaired in 53 eyes (85%), moderately impaired in 6 eyes (10%), and 3 eyes (5%) were considered blind by the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Median VA was worse in Lassa fever survivors with ophthalmic disease findings (p<0.0001) for both anterior segment (p<0.0001) and posterior segment disease (p<0.013). Untreated cataract was a significant cause of visual acuity impairment (p<0.0001). Lassa fever survivors in this cohort were found to have cataract and posterior segment findings that potentially represent sequelae of uveitis associated with visual impairment. Future studies are warranted to improve our understanding of the spectrum of ocular disease in this emerging infectious disease of public health consequence.","Li, Alexa L; Grant, Donald; Gbakie, Michael; Kanneh, Lansana; Mustafa, Ibrahim; Bond, Nell; Engel, Emily; Schieffelin, John; Vandy, Matthew J; Yeh, Steven; Shantha, Jessica G",PLoS One,,429

Immun. 87 (2020) 144-146]",2020,"BACKGROUND: Over the last decade, virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a cutting-edge technology in stroke rehabilitation. VR is defined as a type of computer-user interface that implements real-time simulation of an activity or environment allowing user interaction via multiple sensory modalities. In a stroke population, VR interventions have been shown to enhance motor, cognitive, and psychological recovery when utilized as a rehabilitation adjunct. VR has also demonstrated noninferiority to usual care therapies for stroke rehabilitation. OBJECTIVE: The proposed pilot study aims to (1) determine the feasibility and tolerability of using a therapeutic VR platform in an inpatient comprehensive stroke rehabilitation program and (2) estimate the initial clinical efficacy (effect size) associated with the VR platform using apps for pain distraction and upper extremity exercise for poststroke neurologic recovery. METHODS: This study will be conducted in the Comprehensive Integrated Inpatient Rehabilitation Program at the James A Haley Veterans' Hospital. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with 10 clinical staff members to assess the feasibility of the VR platform from the clinician perspective. A prospective within-subject pretest-posttest pilot design will be used to examine the tolerability of the VR platform and the clinical outcomes (ie, upper extremity neurologic recovery, hand dexterity, pain severity) in 10 veteran inpatients. A VR platform consisting of commercially available pain distraction and upper extremity apps will be available at the participants' bedside for daily use during their inpatient stay (approximately 4-6 weeks). Clinician interviews will be analyzed using qualitative descriptive analysis. Cohen d effect sizes with corresponding 95% CIs will be calculated for upper extremity neurologic recovery, hand dexterity, and pain. The proportion of participants who achieve minimal clinically important difference after using the VR platform will be calculated for each clinical outcome. RESULTS: This study was selected for funding in August 2020. Institutional review board approval was received in October 2020. The project start date was December 2020. The United States Department has issued a moratorium on in-person research activities secondary to COVID-19. Data collection will commence once this moratorium is lifted. CONCLUSIONS: Our next step is to conduct a large multi-site clinical trial that will incorporate the lessons learned from this pilot feasibility study to test the efficacy of a VR intervention in inpatient rehabilitation and transition to home environments. When VR is used in patients' rooms, it serves to provide additional therapy and may reduce clinician burden. VR also presents an opportunity similar to home-based practice exercises. VR can be implemented in both clinical settings and people's own homes, where engagement in ongoing self-management approaches is often most challenging. This unique experience offers the potential for seamless transition from inpatient rehabilitation to the home.

496973,Awareness on impact of quarantine lockdown on environment during covid-19,2020,"Digital technologies have a significant role in collecting, filtering and disseminating information, allowing for social, healthcare and economic activities even in the context of highly restrictive public health measures in the current COVID-19 pandemic. As personal contact is greatly reduced, they also create a shared informational landscape, allowing for a shared threat response. This is a difficult task, since truthfulness of content that leads to actionable knowledge is impossible to consistently validate. So, not only that curation of information is rarely congruent with pressing health issues, but digital spaces may also become fertile ground for misinformation and disinformation, contributing to the devastating effects of an infodemic. Digital intermediaries are useful exactly because their representation of reality is not a true construct, but a result of purposely curated information. However, they are active, dynamic epistemological agents with their own logic and aim. In dealing with a pandemic, we should reconsider the ways how our digital informational landscapes are created and sustained. This urges us to consider ethical governance of digital data curation and dissemination, alongside forms of control of the truthfulness and reach of its content. Some of the most fundamental issues in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic, including the newly available vaccines are reliant on digital information and data sharing among experts, and the role of informing the general public. The need to create a reproducible, valid and truthful informational landscape is paramount, while allowing for free and rational, behavioral individual choices oriented toward preserving and promoting healthy behavior. These are issues at the heart of dealing with any pandemic, as well as a well-organized health care policy.","Curkovic, Marko; Kosec, Andro; Roje Bedekovic, Marina; Bedekovic, Vladimir",J Biomed Inform,,429

500059,Occupational Dermatoses Related to Personal Protective Equipment Used During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic made imperative the search for means to end it, which requires a knowledge of the mechanisms underpinning the multiplication and spread of its cause, the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Many viruses use members of the hosts' chaperoning system to infect the target cells, replicate, and spread, and here we present illustrative examples. Unfortunately, the role of chaperones in the SARS-CoV-2 cycle is still poorly understood. In this review, we examine the interactions of various coronaviruses during their infectious cycle with chaperones in search of information useful for future research on SARS-CoV-2. We also call attention to the possible role of molecular mimicry in the development of autoimmunity and its widespread pathogenic impact in COVID-19 patients. Viral proteins share highly antigenic epitopes with human chaperones, eliciting anti-viral antibodies that crossreact with the chaperones. Both, the critical functions of chaperones in the infectious cycle of viruses and the possible role of these molecules in COVID-19 autoimmune phenomena, make clear that molecular chaperones are promising candidates for the development of antiviral strategies. These could consist of inhibiting-blocking those chaperones that are necessary for the infectious viral cycle, or those that act as autoantigens in the autoimmune reactions causing generalized destructive effects on human tissues.","Paladino, Letizia; Vitale, Alessandra Maria; Caruso Bavisotto, Celeste; Conway de Macario, Everly; Cappello, Francesco; Macario, Alberto J L; Gammazza, Antonella Marino",,,429

515884,Risk of COVID-19 due to Shortage of Personal Protective Equipment,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic imposed in many countries, in the short term, the interruption of face-to-face teaching activities and, in the medium term, the existence of a 'new normal', in which teaching methods should be able to switch from face-to-face to remote overnight. However, this flexibility can pose a great difficulty, especially in the assessment of practical courses with a high student-teacher ratio, in which the assessment tools or methods used in face-to-face learning are not ready to be adopted within a fully online environment. This article presents a case study describing the transformation of the assessment method of a programming course in higher education to a fully online format during the COVID-19 pandemic, by means of an automated student-centered assessment tool. To evaluate the new assessment method, we studied students' interactions with the tool, as well as students' perceptions, which were measured with two different surveys: one for the programming assignments and one for the final exam. The results show that the students' perceptions of the assessment tool were highly positive: if using the tool had been optional, the majority of them would have chosen to use it without a doubt, and they would like other courses to involve a tool like the one presented in this article. A discussion about the use of this tool in subsequent years in the same and related courses is also presented, analyzing the sustainability of this new assessment method.","Barra, E.; Lopez-Pernas, S.; Alonso, A.; Sanchez-Rada, J.

We aimed to ascertain whether social distancing; difficulty with daily activities; and levels of concern regarding COVID-19 changed after the March 16, 2020 announcement of the nation's first shelter-in-place orders (SIPO) among individuals living in the seven affected counties in the San Francisco Bay Area. METHODS: We conducted an online, cross-sectional social media survey from March 14 -April 1, 2020. We measured changes in social distancing behavior; experienced difficulties with daily activities (i.e., access to healthcare, childcare, obtaining essential food and medications); and level of concern regarding COVID-19 after the March 16 shelter-in-place announcement in the San Francisco Bay Area versus elsewhere in the U.S. RESULTS: In this non-representative sample, the percentage of respondents social distancing all of the time increased following the shelter-in-place announcement in the Bay Area (9.2%, 95% CI: 6.6, 11.9) and elsewhere in the U.S. (3.4%, 95% CI: 2.0, 5.0). Respondents also reported increased difficulty obtaining hand sanitizer, medications, and in particular respondents reported increased difficulty obtaining food in the Bay Area (13.3%, 95% CI: 10.4, 16.3) and elsewhere (8.2%, 95% CI: 6.6, 9.7). We found limited evidence that level of concern regarding the COVID-19 crisis changed following the announcement. CONCLUSION: This study characterizes early changes in attitudes, behaviors, and difficulties. As states and localities implement, rollback, and reinstate shelter-in-place orders, ongoing efforts to more fully examine the social, economic, and health impacts of COVID-19, especially among vulnerable populations, are urgently needed.","Elser, Holly; Kiang, Mathew V; John, Esther M; Simard, Julia F; Bondy, Melissa; Nelson, Lorene M; Chen, Wei-Ting; Linos, Eleni",PLoS One,,429

With COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing consequences, mass transportation is actually the main barrier for students and workers dependents of transport to go back to their daily routines with comfort and safety. Thus, the objective is to determine a demand control able to equalize the number of passengers in each car, respecting the COVID-19 social distancing protocols. The number of passengers in each time-of-day range were combined in four different models that included independent variables related to passenger’s behavior indicating that almost 90% of all passengers are following a very strict and straight daily routine that can be coordinated and scheduled creating enough time space one from the other to avoid undesirable concentrations inside buses and bus stops. In conclusion, a very accurate urban management tool can arise from the study and may be able to solve not only the pandemic issues but also to improve local public services efficiency, to attract private investments and to improve citizen's quality of life.","Wernecke Fumagalli, Luis Andre Rezende Denis Alcides Guimarães Thiago André",Journal of Urban Management,,429

This study describes clinical and imaging characteristics of patients with COVID-19 infection who presented with intracranial bleeding in a European multicenter cohort. Methods: This is a multicenter retrospective, observational case series including 18 consecutive patients with COVID-19 infection and intracranial hemorrhage. Data were collected from February to May 2020 at five designated European special care centers for COVID-19. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. Intracranial bleeding was diagnosed on computed tomography (CT) of the brain within one month of the date of COVID-19 diagnosis. The clinical, laboratory, radiologic, and pathologic findings, therapy and outcomes in COVID-19 patients presenting with intracranial bleeding were analyzed. Results: Eighteen patients had evidence of acute intracranial bleeding within 11 days (IQR 9–29) of admission. Six patients had parenchymal hemorrhage (33.3%), 11 had subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) (61.1%), and one patient had subdural hemorrhage (5.6%). Three patients presented with intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) (16.7%). Conclusion: This study represents the largest case series of patients with intracranial hemorrhage diagnosed with COVID-19 based on key European countries with geospatial hotspots of SARS-CoV-2. Isolated SAH along the convexity may be a predominant bleeding manifestation and may occur in a late temporal course of severe COVID-19.","Nawabi, Jawed; Morotti, Andrea; Wildgruber, Moritz; Boulouis, Gregoire; Kraehling, Hermann; Schlunk, Frieder; Can, Elif; Kniep, Helge; Thomalla, Götz; Psychogios, Marios; Hamm, Bernd; Fiehler, Jens; Hanning, Uta; Sporns, Peter",J.

Even in normal circumstances, ICU families frequently experience significant psychological dysfunction-including posttraumatic stress disorder and other trauma-related reactions, especially during the end of life period. The COVID pandemic likely will exacerbate these reactions as more and more families are being barred from the ICU. Consequently, ICU families are facing additional barriers in fully understanding the complex medical needs of their loved ones (and hence being able to make informed care decisions on their behalf); establishing rapport and bonding with nurses and other members of the ICU treatment team; and, in the event that a loved one passes, achieving closure. ICU health care providers can take steps to mitigate these outcomes by being mindful of the unique stressors ICU families are currently facing and tailoring their communication and behavior accordingly.

The evolutionary relationship between 2019-nCoV and the other human respiratory illness-causing coronavirus is not closely related. We sought to characterize the relationship of the translated proteins of 2019-nCoV with other species of Orthocoronavirinae. A phylogenetic tree was constructed from the genome sequences. A cluster tree was developed from the profiles retrieved from the presence and absence of homologs of ten 2019-nCoV proteins. The combined data were used to characterize the relationship of the translated proteins of 2019-nCoV to other species of Orthocoronavirinae. Our analysis reliably suggests that 2019-nCoV is most closely related to BatCoV RaTG13 and belongs to subgenus Sarbecovirus of Betacoronavirus, together with SARS coronavirus and Bat-SARS-like coronavirus. The phylogenetic profiling cluster of homolog proteins of one annotated 2019-nCoV protein against other genome sequences revealed two clades of ten 2019-nCoV proteins. Clade 1 consisted of a group of conserved proteins in Orthocoronavirinae comprising Orf1ab polyprotein, Nucleocapsid protein, Spike glycoprotein, and Membrane protein. Clade 2 comprised six proteins exclusive to Sarbecovirus and Hibecovirus. Two of six Clade 2 nonstructural proteins, NS7b and NS8, were exclusively conserved among 2019-nCoV, BetaCoV_RaTG, and BatSARS-like Cov. NS7b and NS8 have previously been shown to affect immune response signaling in the SARS-CoV experimental model. Thus, we speculated that knowledge of the functional changes in the NS7b and NS8 proteins during evolution may provide important information to explore the human infective property of 2019-nCoV.","Fahmi, Muhamad; Kubota, Yukihiko; Ito, Masahiro",Infect Genet Evol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134820301039; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104272; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32142938/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134820301039,429

The implementation of safety measures in high-income countries has largely mitigated these risks. However, in many low- and middle- income countries (LMICs), resources to institute safety measures are lacking, increasing the risk of occupational exposures to these hazards. The aim of this scoping review is to map and synthesize the available research on occupational hazards among health care workers in LMICs, identify research gaps and inform policy. Searches for relevant articles were conducted in five electronic databases using a broad range of search terms. The inclusion criteria were: quantitative observational or experimental studies which examined exposure to one or more occupational hazards among health care workers in a LMCI; and the article was published in English in a peer-reviewed journal. A total of 99 studies met the inclusion criteria, and data were extracted from these studies. Large proportions of health care workers in LMICs were exposed to biological hazards (bloodborne pathogens, tuberculosis), psychosocial hazards (workplace violence, burnout, job dissatisfaction), ergonomic hazards (musculoskeletal complaints), and chemical hazards (exposure to latex and antineoplastic drugs). The implementation of risk reduction strategies was suboptimal. The majority of the literature was on biological hazards (48%), and research on other hazards was limited in comparison. Occupational safety needs to become a priority public health issue to protect health care workers in LMICs.

This study aims to investigate the voice symptoms and their environmental risk factors as well as the work ability associated with distance teaching and to compare these with symptoms in previous contact teaching. METHODS: We conducted a survey of 121 primary and secondary school teachers across Finland. The survey was advertised online through social media and the replies collected from voluntarily participating teachers. RESULTS: During distance teaching vocal symptoms appeared less often than in school with 71% teachers experiencing them in regular teaching and 44% in distance teaching, VHI result decreased from 7.88 in school teaching to 4.58 in distance teaching. Acoustic conditions were reported to be more suitable in distance teaching with 73% of teachers finding them adequate during distance teaching in comparison to 46% for those in regular teaching. Background noise was the most disturbing factor for a teacher’s voice in the classroom and in distance teaching and this was even more conspicuous in the classroom. Also, subjectively experienced poor indoor air quality at school influenced the voice negatively. Further, voice problems were associated with increased subjective stress levels and reduced ability to work. CONCLUSION: Distance teaching has affected teachers’ voices in a positive way compared with regular teaching. This difference is likely to be due to better acoustics and indoor air quality in distance teaching conditions.

En función de los niveles de riesgo cardiovascular de estos pacientes, puede ser necesario el empleo de estatinas de alta potencia y/o ezetimiba y/o inhibidores de la proproteína convertasa subtilisina (iPCSK9) en pacientes de alto y muy alto riesgo cardiovascular. Los pacientes tratados con iPCSK9 deben seguir con el tratamiento por sus efectos beneficiosos sobre la prevención de la enfermedad cardiovascular. Los pacientes con hipercolesterolemia familiar y COVID-19 son especialmente vulnerables a la enfermedad cardiovascular precoz y deben seguir recibiendo el tratamiento hipolipemiante intensivo. Conclusiones: En los pacientes con COVID-19, la mayoría de las enfermedades cardiovasculares basales son de origen aterosclerótico, con peor pronóstico para los pacientes con alto riesgo y muy alto riesgo de enfermedad cardiovascular. En estos pacientes, el tratamiento intensivo con estatinas y/o combinación fija con ezetimiba y/o iPCSK9 juega un papel fundamental. Abstract Background and objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic has shown that cardiovascular diseases carry a higher risk of mortality. Doubts have been raised regarding lipid therapy in these patients. The objectives are to analyze the efficacy and safety of lipid lowering therapy in patients with COVID-19 Material and Methods: A review of the scientific literature was conducted in PubMed, CDC Reports, NIH, and NCBI SARS-CoV-2 using the keywords: COVID-2; statins; ezetimibe; PCSK9 inhibitors; hypercholesterolemia; and hypolipidemic drugs. Results: The stations should continue to use patients with COVID-19 based on their efficacy, safety, immunosuppressive effects, anti-inflammatory availability and accessibility. Depending on the cardiovascular risk levels of these patients, the use of high potency statins and / or ezetimibe and / or iPCSK9 may be necessary in patients with high and very high cardiovascular risk. Patients treated with iPCSK9 should continue treatment for its beneficial effects in preventing cardiovascular disease. Patients with familial hypercholesterolemia and COVID-19 are especially vulnerable to cardiovascular disease and should continue to receive severe lipid lowering therapy. Conclusions: In patients with COVID-19, the majority of baseline CVDs are of atherosclerotic origin, with the worst prediction for patients with high risk and very high risk of CVD. In these patients, intensive treatment with statins and / or fixed combination with ezetimibe and / or iPCSK9 plays a fundamental role.","Vargas, Manuel Frías; Rodríguez, Ángel Díaz; Fernández, Beatriz Díaz",Semergen,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1138359320302069; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1138359320302069?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32718781/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.semerg.2020.06.014,429

IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine with an essential role in the development and proliferation of regulatory T cells, restricting myeloid and chronic inflammatory T cell responses. However, IL-10 is also essential for the expansion of antigen activated, tumor specific CD8(+) T cells, leading to spontaneous tumor development in IL-10 deficient patients and mice. IL-10 induces IFNγ and cytotoxic mediators in antigen activated T cells. In clinical trials, monotherapy with recombinant, pegylated IL-10 (Pegilodecakin) induced objective responses in cancer patients. Patients receiving pegilodecakin had a systemic increase of IFNγ and granzymes, proliferation and expansion of immune checkpoint positive CD8(+) T cells.

598317,Spectrum of Neurologic & Neuroimaging manifestation of COVID-19,2021-03-03,"BACKGROUND: Sustained spread of SARS-CoV-2 has happened in major US cities. Capacity needs in Chinese cities could inform the planning of local healthcare resources. METHODS: We described the intensive care unit (ICU) and inpatient bed needs for confirmed COVID-19 patients in two Chinese cities (Wuhan and Guangzhou) from January 10 to February 29, 2020, and compared the timing of disease control measures in relation to the timing of SARS-CoV-2 community spread. We estimated the peak ICU bed needs in US cities if a Wuhan-like outbreak occurs. RESULTS: In Wuhan, strict disease control measures were implemented six weeks after sustained local transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Between January 10 and February 29, COVID-19 patients accounted for an average of 637 ICU patients and 3,454 serious inpatients on each day. During the epidemic peak, 19,425 patients (24.5 per 10,000 adults) were hospitalized, 9,689 (12.2 per 10,000 adults) were considered to be in serious condition, and 2,087 patients (2.6 per 10,000 adults) needed critical care per day. In Guangzhou, strict disease control measures were implemented within one week of case importation. Between January 24 and February 29, COVID-19 accounted for an average of 9 ICU patients and 20 inpatients on each day. During the epidemic peak, 15 patients were in critical condition, and 38 were classified as serious. If a Wuhan-like outbreak were to happen in a US city, the need for healthcare resources may be higher in cities with a higher prevalence of vulnerable populations. CONCLUSION: Even after the lockdown of Wuhan on January 23, the number of seriously ill COVID-19 patients continued to rise, exceeding local hospitalization and ICU capacities for at least a month. Plans are urgently needed to mitigate the effect of COVID-19 outbreaks on the local healthcare system in US cities.","Li, Ruoran; Rivers, Caitlin; Tan, Qi; Murray, Megan B; Toner, Eric; Lipsitch, Marc",medRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033241; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32511447/,429

This coronavirus is a virulent mutant of the harmless, ubiquitous feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). To date, feline coronavirus (FCoV) research has been hampered by the lack of susceptible cell lines for the propagation of serotype I FCoVs. In this study, long-term feline intestinal epithelial cell cultures were established from primary ileocytes and colonocytes by simian virus 40 (SV40) T-antigen- and human Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase (hTERT)-induced immortalization. Subsequently, these cultures were evaluated for their usability in FCoV research. Firstly, the replication capacity of the serotype II strains WSU 79–1683 and WSU 79–1146 was studied in the continuous cultures as was done for the primary cultures. In accordance with the results obtained in primary cultures, FCoV WSU 79–1683 still replicated significantly more efficient compared to FCoV WSU 79–1146 in both continuous cultures. In addition, the cultures were inoculated with faecal suspensions from healthy cats and with faecal or tissue suspensions from FIP cats. The cultures were susceptible to infection with different serotype I enteric strains and two of these strains were further propagated. No infection was seen in cultures inoculated with FIPV tissue homogenates. In conclusion, a new reliable model for FCoV investigation and growth of enteric field strains was established. In contrast to FIPV strains, FECVs showed a clear tropism for intestinal epithelial cells, giving an explanation for the observation that FECV is the main pathotype circulating among cats.","Desmarets, Lowiese MB; Theuns, Sebastiaan; Olyslaegers, Dominique AJ; Dedeurwaerder, Annelike; Vermeulen, Ben L; Roukaerts, Inge DM; Nauwynck, Hans J",Vet Res,https://doi.org/10.1186/1297-9716-44-71; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23964891/,429

This increase may be due to the persistence of virus in the CNS in the absence of B cells. In mice lacking antibody receptors or complement pathway activity, virus did not persist yet demyelination was similar to parental mice. In infected RAG1(−/−) mice, moderately sized, typical demyelinating lesions were identified. Therefore, demyelination can occur in the absence of B and T cells.","Matthews, A. E.; Lavi, E.; Weiss, S.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to perform an analysis of expressed emotions in Greek Twitter during the first flow of COVID-19. METHODS: The study period was January 25th to June 30th, 2020. The data collection was performed via the Twitter filter streaming API using appropriate search keywords. The emotional analysis of the tweets that satisfied the inclusion criteria was achieved using a deep learning approach (suggested by Colneric and Demsar 2020) that performs better by utilizing recurrent neural networks on sequences of characters. Emotional epidemiology tools like the six basic emotions (joy, sadness, disgust, fear, surprise, and anger) based on the Paul Eckman classification were adopted. RESULTS: Surprise at the emerging contagion was the most frequent emotion detected, while the imposed isolation resulted mostly in anger (OR=2.108). Yet, Greeks felt rather safe during the first COVID-19 flow, while their positive and negative emotions reflected a masked ""flight or fight"" or fear vs. anger response to the epidemic contagion.

Among these, microarray methods are particularly well suited for diagnostics as they allow multiplexing, or the ability to test for multiple targets simultaneously from the same specimen. Microarray technologies commonly used for the detection and identification of microbial targets include solid-state microarrays, electronic microarrays and bead suspension microarrays. Microarray methods have been applied to microbial detection, genotyping and antimicrobial resistance gene detection. Microarrays can offer a panel approach to diagnose specific patient presentations, such as respiratory or gastrointestinal infections, and can discriminate isolates by genotype for tracking epidemiology and outbreak investigations. And, as more information has become available on specific genes and pathways involved in antimicrobial resistance, we are beginning to be able to predict susceptibility patterns based on sequence detection for particular organisms. With further advances in automated microarray processing methods and genotype–phenotype prediction algorithms, these tests will become even more useful as an adjunct or replacement for conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing, allowing for more rapid selection of targeted therapy for infectious diseases.","Miller, Steve; Karaoz, Ulas; Brodie, Eoin; Dunbar, Sherry",Methods in Microbiology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0580951715000033; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0580951715000033,429

METHODS: We enrolled cases (testing positive) and controls (testing negative) from among the population whose SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostic test results from 24 February-29 April 2021 were reported to the California Department of Public Health. Participants were matched on age, sex, and geographic region. We assessed participants’ self-reported history of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine receipt (BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273). Participants were considered fully vaccinated two weeks after second dose receipt. Among unvaccinated participants, we assessed willingness to receive vaccination. We measured vaccine effectiveness (VE) via the matched odds ratio of prior vaccination, comparing cases with controls. RESULTS: We enrolled 1023 eligible participants aged ≥18 years. Among 525 cases, 71 (13.5%) received BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273; 20 (3.8%) were fully vaccinated with either product. Among 498 controls, 185 (37.1%) received BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273; 86 (16.3%) were fully vaccinated with either product. Two weeks after second dose receipt, VE was 87.0% (95% confidence interval: 68.6-94.6%) and 86.2% (68.4-93.9%) for BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, respectively. Fully vaccinated participants receiving either product experienced 91.3% (79.3-96.3%) and 68.3% (27.9-85.7%) VE against symptomatic and asymptomatic infection, respectively. Among unvaccinated participants, 42.4% (159/375) residing in rural regions and 23.8% (67/281) residing in urban regions reported hesitancy to receive COVID-19 vaccination.

At these junctures, the paper introduces the Arctic situation and the emerging problems, development in agenda setting, the policy processes, and the outcomes of the EU’s and China’s Arctic approaches. It argues that China’s rise as a maritime and Arctic power and its close relations with Russia along the Northern Sea Route shaped the EU’s Arctic policies and their shift towards the Barents sub-Arctic region.

The objective of this study is to summarize China’s countermeasures and experience in response to the COVID-19 emergence in order to serve as a warning for the global COVID-19 prevention and control, and further provide some suggestions for global fighting to COVID-19. METHODS: Content analysis, expert consultation, and high frequency word analysis were applied in this study. Relevant data and information were collected from official websites, the experience accumulated in China during the fighting to the novel coronavirus, and suggestions from some experts. RESULTS: As of March 29, 2020, China had accumulated 82 419 confirmed diagnoses, and the mortality rate was 4.01%; in the mean time, the global had accumulated 596 042 confirmed diagnoses, and the mortality rate was 4.76%. Although the mortality of COVID-19 was not so high, its harmfulness couldn’t be ignored. Ten facts during COVID-19 epidemic in China were summarized in the study, including: the COVID-19 is highly contagious and can be spread through many channels; although elderly people and people with underlying diseases are susceptible, young people can also be victims; isolation is the most effective way to reduce the risk of COVID-19, and secondary disasters induced by COVID-19 should be emphasized in advance.

Person-to-person transmission is evident in outbreaks involving household and hospital contacts. Effective antivirals are urgently needed. METHODS: We used small compound-based forward chemical genetics to screen a chemical library of 1280 known drugs against influenza A virus in Biosafety Level-2 laboratory. We then assessed the anti-MERS-CoV activities of the identified compounds and of interferons, nelfinavir, and lopinavir because of their reported anti-coronavirus activities in terms of cytopathic effect inhibition, viral yield reduction, and plaque reduction assays in Biosafety Level-3 laboratory. RESULTS: Ten compounds were identified as primary hits in high-throughput screening. Only mycophenolic acid exhibited low EC(50) and high selectivity index. Additionally, ribavirin and interferons also exhibited in-vitro anti-MERS-CoV activity. The serum concentrations achievable at therapeutic doses of mycophenolic acid and interferon-β1b were 60–300 and 3–4 times higher than the concentrations at which in-vitro anti-MERS-CoV activities were demonstrated, whereas that of ribavirin was ∼2 times lower. Combination of mycophenolic acid and interferon-β1b lowered the EC(50) of each drug by 1–3 times.

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study on 7.347 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus as the principal diagnosis, using hospitalization discharge summary data from January 1 to December 31, 2015. Disease stages were classified as stages 1, 2, and 3. RESULTS: Of 7.347 patients, 16.2% had urinary tract infections. The urinary tract infection prevalence was 24.4% in 428 patients in stage 1 and 4.8% in 2.840 patients in stage 2; it was higher among patients who underwent medical procedures than among those who underwent surgery (24.4% vs 4.8%). In multivariate regression analysis, age (OR = 1.031; 95% CI = 1.02–1.04), length of hospitalization (OR = 1.018; 95% CI = 1.013–1.024), sex (woman) (OR = 2.248; 95% CI = 1.778–2.842), comorbidity of stage 3 cerebrovascular disease (OR = 1.737; 95% CI = 1.111–2.714), and comorbidity of stage 1 colorectal cancer (OR = 2.417; 95% CI = 1.152–5.074) were found to be the risk factors of urinary tract infection in the ten hospitals considered. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that urinary tract infection prevalence was higher in women without evidence of organ injury and those receiving medical treatment. Comorbidities (cerebrovascular disease and colorectal cancer) were identified as risk factors.","Carrondo, Maria Cristina; Moita, Joaquim Jorge",Obes Med,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451847620300105; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2451847620300105; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32289092/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.obmed.2020.100190,429

The scientific community’s massive response has resulted in a flood of experiments, analyses, hypotheses, and publications, especially in the field of drug repurposing. However, many of the proposed therapeutic compounds obtained from SARS-CoV-2 specific assays are not in agreement and thus demonstrate the need for a singular source of COVID-19 related information from which a rational selection of drug repurposing candidates can be made. In this paper, we present the COVID-19 PHARMACOME, a comprehensive drug-target-mechanism graph generated from a compilation of 10 separate disease maps and sources of experimental data focused on SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pathophysiology. By applying our systematic approach, we were able to predict the synergistic effect of specific drug pairs, such as Remdesivir and Thioguanosine or Nelfinavir and Raloxifene, on SARS-CoV-2 infection. Experimental validation of our results demonstrate that our graph can be used to not only explore the involved mechanistic pathways, but also to identify novel combinations of drug repurposing candidates.","Schultz, Bruce; Zaliani, Andrea; Ebeling, Christian; Reinshagen, Jeanette; Bojkova, Denisa; Lage-Rupprecht, Vanessa; Karki, Reagon; Lukassen, Sören; Gadiya, Yojana; Ravindra, Neal G.; Das, Sayoni; Baksi, Shounak; Domingo-Fernández, Daniel; Lentzen, Manuel; Strivens, Mark; Raschka, Tamara; Cinatl, Jindrich; DeLong, Lauren Nicole; Gribbon, Phil; Geisslinger, Gerd; Ciesek, Sandra; van Dijk, David; Gardner, Steve; Kodamullil, Alpha Tom; Fröhlich, Holger; Peitsch, Manuel; Jacobs, Marc; Hoeng, Julia; Eils, Roland; Claussen, Carsten; Hofmann-Apitius, Martin",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-90296-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34040048/,429

This is because those populations may have specific characteristics, culture and behaviours that can accelerate the spread of the virus, and they usually have less access to healthcare, particularly in times of crisis. In order to carry out a comprehensive national intervention plan, policy makers should be sensitive to the needs and lifestyles of these groups, while taking into account structural and cultural gaps. In the context of Israel, the two most prominent and well-defined minority groups are the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community and parts of the Arab population. The government was slow to recognize the unique position of these two groups, public pressure eventually led to a response that was tailored to the ultra-Orthodox community and during the month of Ramadan a similar response has been implemented among the Arab community.","Waitzberg, Ruth; Davidovitch, Nadav; Leibner, Gideon; Penn, Nadav; Brammli-Greenberg, Shuli",Int J Equity Health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12939-020-01191-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32429995/,429

A series of unprecedented shocks is straining the capacity of food assistance organizations to reach vulnerable populations. We discuss how the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting the demand and the supply of international food assistance, and we propose three policy changes that can keep food flowing to those in need. First, donor countries can prioritize humanitarian spending in aid-allocation decisions. Second, governments can exempt food assistance from trade barriers that impede procurement (export restrictions) and delivery (import tariffs). Third, donor countries can allow flexibility for implementing agencies by untying food assistance from domestic procurement and shipping restrictions. All of these suggestions are regulatory changes that can be made without requiring increased spending. These options are particularly relevant now because donor-country governments are entering economic recessions, and foreign aid budgets will be constrained.","Cardwell, Ryan; Ghazalian, Pascal L.",World Dev,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X20301856?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.105059; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0305750X20301856; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834375/,429

METHODS: The electronic database of Embase and PubMed were searched for relevant studies. A meta-analysis of eligible studies that reported the prevalence of abnormal urine analysis and kidney dysfunction in COVID-19 was performed. The incidences of AKI were compared between severe versus non-severe patients and survivors versus non-survivors. RESULTS: A total of 24 studies involving 4963 confirmed COVID-19 patients were included. The proportions of patients with elevation of sCr and BUN levels were 9.6% (95% CI 5.7–13.5%) and 13.7% (95% CI 5.5–21.9%), respectively. Of all patients, 57.2% (95% CI 40.6–73.8%) had proteinuria, 38.8% (95% CI 26.3–51.3%) had proteinuria +, and 10.6% (95% CI 7.9–13.3%) had proteinuria ++ or +++. The overall incidence of AKI in all COVID-19 patients was 4.5% (95% CI 3.0–6.0%), while the incidence of AKI was 1.3% (95% CI 0.2–2.4%), 2.8% (95% CI 1.4–4.2%), and 36.4% (95% CI 14.6–58.3%) in mild or moderate cases, severe cases, and critical cases, respectively. Meanwhile, the incidence of AKI was 52.9%(95% CI 34.5–71.4%), 0.7% (95% CI − 0.3–1.8%) in non-survivors and survivors, respectively. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was required in 5.6% (95% CI 2.6–8.6%) severe patients, 0.1% (95% CI − 0.1–0.2%) non-severe patients and 15.6% (95% CI 10.8–20.5%) non-survivors and 0.4% (95% CI − 0.2–1.0%) survivors, respectively.

METHODS: We assessed diagnostic performance of existing cases definitions (e.g. influenza-like illness, COVID-like illness) using symptoms reported from 185 household contacts to a PCR-confirmed case of COVID-19 in Wisconsin and Utah, United States. We stratified analyses between adults and children. We also constructed novel case definitions for comparison. RESULTS: Existing COVID-19 case definitions generally showed high sensitivity (86–96%) but low positive predictive value (PPV) (36–49%; F-1 score 52–63) in this community cohort. Top performing novel symptom combinations included taste or smell dysfunction and improved the balance of sensitivity and PPV (F-1 score 78–80). Performance indicators were generally lower for children (< 18 years of age). CONCLUSIONS: Existing COVID-19 case definitions appropriately screened in household contacts with COVID-19. Novel symptom combinations incorporating taste or smell dysfunction as a primary component improved accuracy. Case definitions tailored for children versus adults should be further explored.

In response to this, the Scale Measuring the Impact of Interprofessional Learning (SMIIL) was developed to facilitate the context-driven evaluation of IPL interventions in the undergraduate setting. Items of this scale reflect common IPL themes and align to levels one to three of the modified Kirkpatrick's model. This scale was piloted in a cohort of 787 BMBS (Bachelor of Medicine Bachelor of Surgery) students at a medical school in the South West of England. A response rate of 22.7% was achieved despite the disruption of face-to-face data collection during the Covid-19 lockdown (March to July 2020). Descriptive statistics, factor analysis, and Cronbach's Alpha were used to validate and refine the scale. The resultant SMIIL is a unidimensional instrument comprised of 17 items with an acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.80). Further research is required to develop the scale fully and validate it by involving different cohorts of pre-qualification healthcare students in multiple localities and varying styles of IPL interventions.","Sebastian, Juliet; Eaton, Mike",Journal of interprofessional care,https://doi.org/10.1080/13561820.2021.1938520; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34311668/,429

Concern was voiced as to the impact on the psychiatric stability of this population due to anxiety about the pandemic, recommended isolation, and limited in-person interactions with treatment providers and support systems. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on a cohort of involuntarily hospitalized SMI patients.Methods: The electronic medical records from March 28 through December 31, 2020 of all COVID-positive psychiatric inpatients were retrospectively reviewed. No outpatients or readmissions were included in the sample.Results: During the study period 238, COVID-positive inpatients were identified out of approximately 12,859 discreet admissions. The sample consisted of 158 men (66%) and 80 women (34%). The mean age of positive patients was 41 years. Eight patients (3%) required medical hospitalizations related to COVID-19, with 1 death. Ninety-seven patients (41%) had at least 1 or more of the known medical comorbidities related to increased risk for COVID-19 infection. Seclusion, restraints, and administration of as-needed medications (PRN) for anxiety or psychotic agitation occurred less frequently in the COVID-positive patients compared to those without infection.Conclusions: Medical hospitalizations were infrequent in the study sample. Medical comorbidities were much higher in this group relative to statewide data.

This is closely related to lifestyle habits such as dietary intake and physical activity; hence, self-management should be continuously practiced. However, after childbirth, women find it challenging to practice self-management due to physical discomfort and child rearing. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an intervention program that is tailored to the characteristics of each participant and allows them to practice self-health management efficiently without time and space restrictions. This study aimed to develop a self-management mobile virtual reality program and investigate its efficacy in preventing type 2 diabetes after childbirth among women diagnosed with gestational diabetes. Intervention with the self-management mobile virtual reality program was performed for 12 weeks. The data of 57 participants in the experimental group and 62 participants in the control group were analyzed. After 12 weeks, the body weight, body fat, hemoglobin A1c, and fasting glucose were decreased in the experimental group compared with the control group. In addition, the dietary habits and health-promoting lifestyle profile were improved in the experimental group compared with the control group.

There are no studies that specifically investigate the frequency, characteristics, and presentation patterns of pain in COVID-19 infection. AIMS: Our aim is to evaluate the frequency, localization, and severity of pain among the presenting signs and symptoms in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Patients with the diagnosis of COVID-19 who were admitted to our hospital between March and June 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients’ general symptoms at the first admission to the hospital, presence of pain at admission, localization, severity, and persistence of pain were queried by phone call. RESULTS: A total of 210 inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 were recruited from the hospitals database. Complaints of the patients were 76.6% fatigue, 69.3% pain, 62% fever, 45.3% cough, 43.5% loss of taste and/or smell, 25% diarrhea, and 0.5% skin lesions respectively. Pain was the chief complaint in of 46.61% of the patients. Pain complaints had started on average 2.2 (± 2.8) days before admission. Among 133 patients reporting pain, the distribution of site was 92 (69.2%) myalgia/arthralgia; 67 (50.4%) headache; 58 (43.6%) back pain; 44 (33.1%) low back pain; 33 (25.0%) chest pain; 28 (21.1%) sore throat; and 18 (13.6%) abdominal pain. CONCLUSIONS: The most common pain symptoms were myalgia/arthralgia and headache (69.17% and 50.37%) and found to be much higher than previously reported. Pain is one of the most common complaints of admission to the hospital in patients with COVID-19. Patients who apply to health institutions with pain complaints should be evaluated and questioned in suspicion of COVID-19 infection.","Murat, Sadiye; Dogruoz Karatekin, Bilinc; Icagasioglu, Afitap; Ulasoglu, Celal; İçten, Sacit; Incealtin, Onur",Ir J Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33188626/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11845-020-02433-x,429

Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing, we characterized the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from uninfected controls and COVID-19 patients and cells in paired broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF). We found a close association of decreased dendritic cells (DCs) and increased monocytes resembling myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), which correlated with lymphopenia and inflammation in the blood of severe COVID-19 patients. Those MDSC-like monocytes were immune-paralyzed. In contrast, monocyte-macrophages in BALFs of COVID-19 patients produced massive amounts of cytokines and chemokines, but secreted little interferons. The frequencies of peripheral T cells and NK cells were significantly decreased in severe COVID-19 patients, especially for innate-like T and various CD8(+) T cell subsets, compared to healthy controls. In contrast, the proportions of various activated CD4(+) T cell subsets among the T cell compartment, including Th1, Th2, and Th17-like cells were increased and more clonally expanded in severe COVID-19 patients. Patients’ peripheral T cells showed no sign of exhaustion or augmented cell death, whereas T cells in BALFs produced higher levels of IFNG, TNF, CCL4, CCL5, etc. Paired TCR tracking indicated abundant recruitment of peripheral T cells to the severe patients’ lung. Together, this study comprehensively depicts how the immune cell landscape is perturbed in severe COVID-19.","Xu, Gang; Qi, Furong; Li, Hanjie; Yang, Qianting; Wang, Haiyan; Wang, Xin; Liu, Xiaoju; Zhao, Juanjuan; Liao, Xuejiao; Liu, Yang; Liu, Lei; Zhang, Shuye; Zhang, Zheng",Cell Discov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33101705/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41421-020-00225-2,429

In this scenario, distinct population groups might react differently. Vegetarians, who follow a non-conventional dietary pattern, could be more vulnerable to the abrupt changes in normal life routine and economic instability. Therefore, this study aimed at evaluating if the current pandemic situation somehow affected vegetarians’ QoL. A cross-sectional study was carried out in Brazil between 28 July and 14 September 2020 to evaluate the QoL in vegetarians during the pandemic period. Vegetarian adults replied to an online survey that included the VEGQOL and WHOQOL-BREF instruments to evaluate QoL and questions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 1282 individuals participated. Only 3.8% had tested positive for COVID-19, but 39.9% affirmed having a family member who tested positive for the disease. Almost half (46.3%) of the sample had an income drop due to the pandemic. Results of QoL scores in the different subcategories of vegetarians were similar to previously published data. Individuals who had already tested positive for COVID-19 had lower QoL scores than those who did not test positive, but only in the VEGQOL. QoL was lower for the participants who declared that Sars-Cov-2 had already infected a family member for almost all the parameters evaluated. On the other hand, an income drop affected QoL only partially. Studying how vegetarians are influenced by such conditions contributes to the generation of relevant data that can be used to support healthcare and public policies in the future.","Hargreaves, Shila Minari; Nakano, Eduardo Yoshio; Han, Heesup; Raposo, António; Ariza-Montes, Antonio; Vega-Muñoz, Alejandro; Zandonadi, Renata Puppin",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34444808/; https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13082651,429

These immune complexes (ICs) have been tested in humans and animal models, mostly in forms of experimental or clinical vaccination, for at least a century. With intensified research on Fcγ receptor‐mediated immune modulation, as well as with immune complex‐directed antigen processing, presentation, and inflammatory responses, there are renewed interests of using ICs in vaccines and immunotherapies. Currently, IC‐based immune therapy has been broadly experimented in HBV and HIV viral infection control and antitumor treatments. However, mechanistic insights of IC‐based treatments are relatively recent subjects of study; strong efforts are needed to establish links to connect laboratory findings with clinical practices.

A reply,2020-07-07,"COVID-19 is a global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection and is associated with both acute and chronic disorders affecting the nervous system. Acute neurological disorders affecting patients with COVID-19 range widely from anosmia, stroke, encephalopathy/encephalitis, and seizures to Guillain-Barre Syndrome. Chronic neurological sequelae are less well defined although exercise intolerance, dysautonomia, pain, as well as neurocognitive and psychiatric dysfunctions are commonly reported. Molecular analyses of cerebrospinal fluid and neuropathological studies highlight both vascular and immunologic perturbations. Low levels of viral RNA have been detected in the brains of few acutely ill individuals. Potential pathogenic mechanisms in the acute phase include coagulopathies with associated cerebral hypoxic-ischemic injury, blood-brain barrier abnormalities with endotheliopathy and possibly viral neuroinvasion accompanied by neuro-immune responses. Established diagnostic tools are limited by a lack of clearly defined COVID-19 specific neurological syndromes. Future interventions will require delineation of specific neurological syndromes, diagnostic algorithm development, and uncovering the underlying disease mechanisms that will guide effective therapies.","Balcom, Erin F; Nath, Avindra; Power, Christopher",Brain,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34398188/; https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awab302,429

These issues were not observed in Canada or elsewhere; consequently, recommendations from Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) and the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) on whether to use LAIV differed for two influenza seasons (2016-2017 and 2017-2018). This retrospective describes how NACI arrived at its recommendations in response to post-market signals of reduced LAIV performance from the US in 2013-2014 and again in 2015-2016. NACI's experience with LAIV marks the first time in Canada where a preferential recommendation on the use of an influenza vaccine in a routine immunization program was reversed. This experience highlights the importance of ongoing post-market monitoring of vaccines, international collaboration and careful consideration of local context to inform vaccine recommendations. NACI's capacity for timely responses to post-market vaccine performance signals will facilitate responsiveness to similar post-market monitoring signals from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines.","Zhao, Linlu; Young, Kelsey; House, Althea; Stirling, Rob; Tunis, Matthew",Canada communicable disease report = Releve des maladies transmissibles au Canada,https://doi.org/10.14745/ccdr.v47i56a06; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34220353/,429
639659,Coronavirus antibody positive tests and continued use of personal protective equipment throughout the pandemic,2020-06-20,"BACKGROUND: Physiological changes during pregnancy put pregnant women at higher risk for COVID-19 complications. The objective of this study was to evaluate clinical and laboratory characteristics and outcomes of 24 COVID-19 pregnant patients and their newborns referred to the Al-Zahra tertiary maternity hospital in Tabriz, Iran. METHODS: Clinical records of 24 COVID-19 confirmed pregnant patients were retrospectively reviewed from10 March 2020 to 15 April 2020. Vertical transition was assessed through neonatal pharyngeal swab samples. The study has been approved by the Tabriz University Medical Ethics Committee (IR.TBZMED.REC.1399.497). RESULTS: There were 24 hospitalized cases with clinical symptoms and confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. The mean age of cases was 26.5 years; most were nulliparous (54.2%), in their third trimester (62.5%) and were in the type A blood group. Clinical symptoms in order of prevalence were cough, fever, dyspnea, myalgia, anosmia, and diarrhea. Oxygen saturation (SpO2) in 70.8% cases was in the normal range (greater than 93%). The risk of premature labor or abortion in cases showed no increase. 12 cases were in ongoing normal status; on follow up, 11 cases had delivered their babies at term and one had ended in IUFD because of pregnancy-induced hypertension. All delivered babies were healthy. Caesarean section in all cases was performed under obstetric indications or maternal demand, and no relation was found between COVID-19 and Caesarean delivery. Neonatal outcomes according to gestational age in 8 cases out of 11 (72.72%) were desirable; neonatal morbidity and mortality resulted from pregnancy complications. Blood pH in 6 neonates was assessed due to immaturity and NICU admission, all of which were in normal ranges except one case related to HELLP syndrome. There was no evidence of vertical transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that clinical symptoms in pregnancy were similar to non-pregnant women, no rise in risk of premature labor or abortion was seen, and vertical transmission was not observed in none of cases. Lymphopenia was the leading laboratory change. Given asymptomatic cases despite severe forms of infection in pregnancies, we propose screening in all suspected cases. All placentas and newborns should be tested in the field for vertical transmission.","Vaezi, Maryam; Mirghafourvand, Mojgan; Hemmatzadeh, Shahla",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34001013/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-021-03764-y,429

Thus, we propose a new way of comparison countries that avoids the main difficulties in the comparison by using three-dimensional trajectories for this type of data. Methods: We introduce a new index to analyze the level of confinement that each country was subject to overtime, based on the Community Mobility Reports published by Google resorting to Principal Component Analysis. Subsequently, by using longitudinal clustering, we divide the European countries into similar groups according to the COVID-19 obits and also to the confinement index. However, to make the most out of the clustering methods we resort to artificial longitudinal data to evaluate both the methods and the indices. Results: By using artificial data, we discover that Calinski–Harabasz outperformed other internal indices in indicating the real number of clusters. The tests also suggested that [Formula: see text]-means with Euclidean distance was the best method among the ones studied. With the application to both the mobility and fatalities datasets, we found two groups in each one. Conclusions: Our analysis enables us to discover that European northern countries had more mobility during the first confinement and that the deaths caused by COVID-19 started to drop around the 40th day since the first death.","da Costa, Joaquim Pinto; Garcia, André",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34464767/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2021.106346; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016926072100420X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016926072100420X,429

Its roles in neuronal processes such as learning, memory or cognition are well established, and also in disorders such as depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and dementia. However, its effects on adhesion and cytoskeletal remodelling which are strongly affected by 5-HT receptors, are not as well studied with some exceptions for e.g. platelet aggregation. Neuronal function is strongly dependent on cell-cell contacts and adhesion-related processes. Therefore the role played by serotonin in psychiatric illness, as well as in the positive and negative effects of neuropsychiatric drugs through cell-related adhesion can be of great significance.

STUDY DESIGN: Children between 1 and 6 years of age, their parents and caregivers in 14 childcare facilities in Dresden, Saxony/Germany were invited to participate in the KiTaCoviDD19-study between July 2020 and January 2021. Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was assessed up to 4 times during the study period in all participating adults and personal characteristics as well as epidemiologic information of personal SARS-CoV-2 history were obtained. Samples for stool virus shedding of SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed by PCR every 2-4 weeks in all participating children. RESULTS: In total, 318 children, 299 parents and 233 childcare workers were enrolled. By January 2021, 11% of the participating adults were detected as seropositive, whereas the percentage of children shedding SARS-CoV-2 was 6.8%. Overall, we detected 17 children with SARS-CoV-2 virus shedding in 8 different childcare facilities. In 4 facilities there occurred a maximum of 3 connected cases in children. About 50% of SARS-CoV-2 infections in children could not be connected to a secondary case within our study population. CONCLUSION: This study does not provide evidence for relevant asymptomatic (“silent”) spread of SARS-CoV-2 in childcare facilities, in either a low or a high prevalence setting.

Viral transmission occurs directly or indirectly via fomites. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence and viability of FCV in the environment after sequential oronasal infections of specified pathogen-free cats with two FCV field strains in a research facility. Replicating virus was detected in saliva swabs from all ten cats after the first and in four out of ten cats after the second FCV exposure using virus isolation to identify FCV shedders. In the environment, where cleaning, but no disinfection took place, FCV viral RNA was detectable using RT-qPCR on all tested items and surfaces, including cat hair. However, only very limited evidence was found of replicating virus using virus isolation. Viral RNA remained demonstrable for at least 28 days after shedding had ceased in all cats. Disinfection with 5% sodium bicarbonate (and Incidin(TM) Plus) and barrier measures were effective in that no viral RNA was detectable outside the cat rooms.

Here, we use population size for pathogen transmission to measure the intensity of public health interventions, which is a key characteristic variable for nowcasting and forecasting of COVID-19. By formulating a hidden Markov dynamic system and using nonlinear filtering theory, we have developed a stochastic epidemic dynamic model under public health interventions. The model parameters and states are estimated in time from internationally available public data by combining an unscented filter and an interacting multiple model filter. Moreover, we consider the computability of the population size and provide its selection criterion. With applications to COVID-19, we estimate the mean of the effective reproductive number of China and the rest of the globe except China (GEC) to be 2.4626 (95% CI: 2.4142–2.5111) and 3.0979 (95% CI: 3.0968–3.0990), respectively. The prediction results show the effectiveness of the stochastic epidemic dynamic model with nonlinear filtering. The hidden Markov dynamic system with nonlinear filtering can be used to make analysis, nowcasting and forecasting for other contagious diseases in the future since it helps to understand the mechanism of disease transmission and to estimate the population size for pathogen transmission and the number of hidden infections, which is a valid tool for decision-making by policy makers for epidemic control.","Zhang, Xuqi; Liu, Haiqi; Tang, Hanning; Zhang, Mei; Yuan, Xuedong; Shen, Xiaojing",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34504277/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-97578-9,429
651375,Contributing factors to personal protective equipment shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020-10-02,"At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States Cutaneous Lymphoma Consortium (USCLC) and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Cutaneous Lymphoma Task Force (EORTC-CLTF) developed emergency guidelines for the management of patients with cutaneous lymphomas (CLs) during the pandemic. These emergency protocols were intended to ensure patient safety and called for dose modifications, treatment delays and treatment interruptions as necessary to minimize exposure risks to COVID-19. Because there are no established maintenance protocols for CLs, the impact of such delays or interruptions on disease outcomes was not known. The ISCL created an International Cutaneous Lymphomas Pandemic Section (ICLYPS) to collect data from the institutions around the world to assess the impact of these changes on patients’ outcomes and to determine if these measures were effective in preventing infection. We summarize the outcomes from a preliminary cohort of patients from Brazil, Greece, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, the UK and the US. Actively managed patients with an established diagnosis of CL from March to October 2020 were included according to the Institutional Protection of Human Subjects guidelines at the respective centers. We included 149 patients in this retrospective review. The average age was 61.88 years (range: 22–95). 2 patients (1.3%) had diagnoses of CD30+ lymphoproliferative disorders (LyP and pcALCL), 112 (75.2%) had mycosis fungoides (MF), and 35 (23.5%) had Sézary syndrome (SS). 77 patients (68.7%) had stages IA–IIA MF, 23 (20.5%) had Stage IIB MF, 6 (5.4%) had stage III MF, and 41 (27.5%) had Stage IV disease, of which 6 had Stage IV MF (5.4%) and 35 had SS (23.5%). Treatment was delayed for more than half (53.0%) of the patients for a mean of 3.2 months (range: 10 days to 10 months). Treatment delay was associated with a significant risk of disease relapse or progression across all stages (65.8% vs 32.9%, p<0.00001). During follow up, 6 patients (4%) died due to disease progression, including 3 patients with Stage IIB MF, one with Stage IVB MF, and two with SS. Twenty-eight patients (18.8%) had a confirmed COVID-19 infection during the capture period. Two of these cases were definitive hospital-acquired infections following prolonged hospital admission, while the remaining contracted the virus through community exposures. There were no outpatient office-acquired infections. Three of the 26 patients who contracted COVID-19 died of the infection (2 SS and 1 LyP, mean age: 80, range: 66–89). The ICLYPS analysis has revealed that treatment interruptions and delays during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significantly worse outcomes in patients with CLs as compared to those who did not experience treatment interruptions. No outpatient office-acquired infections were reported in this extensive review, and patients with CLs who developed COVID-19 did not do worse than expected according to their risk factors. Effective safety measures and protocols can prevent transmission of COVID-19 at physicians’ offices. Interruption of therapy leads to negative clinical outcomes and should be avoided, especially in the setting of advanced disease, as the risk of contracting COVID-19 in the outpatient setting did not outweigh the risk of morbidity and mortality due to disease progression. Ensuring continuity of treatment and maintenance therapy appears to be critical to avoiding life-threatening disease progression.","Geskin, Larisa J; Garcia-Saleem, Tiffany; Akilov, Oleg E; Enz, Paula; Guenova, Emmanuella; Ortiz-Romero, Pablo L; Papadavid, Evangelia; Quaglino, Pietro; Rozati, Sima; Stonesifer, Connor; Burns, Austin; Khaleel, Alexandra; Scarisbrick, Julia J",European Journal of Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0959-8049(21)00685-7; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959804921006857; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0959804921006857,429

USE OF AUDITORY BRAINSTEM RESPONSES AND NEUROIMAGING FOR LONG-TERM PATIENT FOLLOW-UP.,2020-05-15,"BACKGROUND: Nocturnal cough and wheeze are important symptoms when diagnosing any respiratory disease in a child, but objective measurements of these symptoms are not performed. METHODS: The aim of our study was to analyze the use of an automated detection system to assess breath sounds objectively in comparison to cough and wheeze questionnaires and to evaluate its feasibility in clinical practice. RESULTS: Forty-nine recordings of thirty-nine children were processed (asthma n = 13; cystic fibrosis n = 2; pneumonia n = 5; suspicion of habit cough n = 7; prolonged, recurrent or chronic cough n = 13), and cough and asthma scores were compared to the objective nocturnal recordings. Time for audio-validation of recordings took between 2 and 40 min (mean: 14.22 min, (SD): 10.72). Accuracy of the automated measurement was higher for cough than for wheezing sounds. Nocturnal cough readings but not wheeze readings correlated with some of the corresponding scores. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge this is the first study using a new device to assess nocturnal cough and obstructive breath sounds objectively in children with a wide variety of respiratory diseases. The assessment proved user friendly. We obtained additional information on nighttime symptoms, which would otherwise have remained obscure. Further studies to assess possible diagnostic and therapeutic benefits of this device are needed.","Lindenhofer, Markus; Roth, Lena; Mädel, Clemens; Götzinger, Florian; Kainz, Katharina; Lex, Christiane; Frischer, Thomas; Reinweber, Matthias; Zacharasiewicz, Angela",BMC Pediatr,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12887-020-02455-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33308199/,429

653461,Emergent hospital reform in response to outbreak of COVID-19,2020-05-06,"Romania officially declared its first SARS-CoV-2 case on February 26, 2020. The first and largest COVID-19 outbreak in Romania was recorded in Suceava, N/E region of the country, and originated at the Suceava regional county hospital. Following sheltering-in-place measures, infection rates decreased, only to rise again after relaxation of measures. This study describes the incursion of SARS-CoV-2 in Suceava and other parts of Romania and analyzes the mutations and their association with clinical manifestation of the disease during the period of COVID-19 outbreak. Phylogenetic analysis indicated multiple sites of origin for SARS-CoV-2 strains in Suceava, specifically from Spain, Italy and Russia, but also other strains related to those from Czech Republic, Belgium and France. Most Suceava samples contained mutations common to European lineages, such as A20268G, however aproximately 10% of samples were missing such mutations, indicating a possible different origin. While overall genome regions ORF1ab, S and ORF7 were subject to most mutations, several recurring mutations such as C27707T were identified, and these were mainly present in severe forms of the disease. Non-synonymous mutations, such as C3225A (Thr987Asn in NSP3a domain), associated with changes in a protein responsible for decreasing viral tethering in human host were also present. Patients with diabetes and hypertension exhibited eight and three time,s respectively, higher odds ratios of acquiring severe forms of the disease and these were mainly related to C27707T mutation. These results will aid in tracing virus movement throughout Romania and identification of infectivity, virulence and pathogenicity.","Lobiuc, A.; Dimian, M.; Puscaselu, R.; Sturdza, O.; Covasa, M.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20248741v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.22.20248741,429

Indeed, the pandemic has had a considerable impact on the delivery of medical education in the UK for both pre-clinical and clinical year students. In response to the escalating case fatality rate due to the pandemic, there has been widespread termination of clinical placements, face-to-face teaching sessions, and examinations that require a physical presence by UK medical schools. It is hoped that the cancellation of the aforementioned activities will greatly reduce the exposure of medical students to the coronavirus however, the consequences of these actions may pose substantial issues for the learning experience and professional development of medical students. One such issue is the lack of regular communication between students and personal tutors which may give rise to burnout within students and impede academic performance. Furthermore, the suspension of clinical placements may result in a gradual reduction in students’ clinical skills competence. The practice of medicine is grounded upon the application of basic science which involves undertaking clinical procedures and as such, students may be at a disadvantage due to the missed opportunity to refine these essential skills. In this article, we provide an overview of the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical education, specifically regarding curriculum delivery and assessment of students. We also adopt a holistic approach by considering the impact of the pandemic on the mental wellbeing of medical students during this unprecedented time. We offer pragmatic suggestions to uphold the quality of medical education such as the implementation of virtual interprofessional education sessions to solve clinical vignettes and virtual consultation skills with simulated patients. We conclude with suggested areas for future research to examine the effectiveness of a virtual interprofessional education model on both short and long-term learning as well as encouraging medical students and academic staff to trial innovative methods of teaching. Despite the resultant complications of the pandemic on medical education, these challenging times may present a serendipitous opportunity for medical students to cultivate the personal attributes expected of a doctor in the face of adversity. In light of the pandemic, there is scope to reconsider the effectiveness of current medical education and welcome innovative methods of delivering education whilst ensuring quality. The combination of recent telecommunication developments with current teaching methodologies may positively change the future landscape of medical education.","Sani, Immanuel; Hamza, Yaser; Chedid, Youssef; Amalendran, Jubilent; Hamza, Nadir",Ann Med Surg (Lond),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32983429/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2049080120302934; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2020.08.045; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2049080120302934,429

Autotaxin (ATX; ENPP2), the enzyme largely responsible for extracellular lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) production, has been suggested to play a pathogenic role in, among others, pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were subjected to low and high tidal volume mechanical ventilation using a small animal ventilator: respiratory mechanics were evaluated, and plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples were obtained. Total protein concentration was determined, and lung histopathology was further performed RESULTS: Injurious ventilation resulted in increased BALF levels of ATX. Genetic deletion of ATX from bronchial epithelial cells attenuated VILI-induced pulmonary edema.

Sample types include whole blood, plasma, serum, leukocytes, and DNA. The GCB links samples to detailed clinical data available in the GEN-COVID Patient Registry (GCPR). It includes hospitalized patients (74.25%), broken down into intubated, treated by CPAP-biPAP, treated with O2 supplementation, and without respiratory support (9.5%, 18.4%, 31.55% and 14.8, respectively); and non-hospitalized subjects (25.75%), either pauci- or asymptomatic. More than 150 clinical patient-level data fields have been collected and binarized according to the organs/systems primarily affected by COVID-19: heart, liver, pancreas, kidney, chemosensors, innate or adaptive immunity, and clotting system, for further statistics. Hierarchical Clustering analysis identified five main clinical categories: i) severe multisystemic failure with either thromboembolic or pancreatic variant; ii) cytokine storm type either severe with liver involvement or moderate; iii) moderate heart type either with or without liver damage; iv) moderate multisystemic involvement either with or without liver damage; v) mild either with or without hyposmia. GCB and GCPR are further linked to the GEN-COVID Genetic Data Repository (GCGDR), which includes data from Whole Exome Sequencing and high-density SNP genotyping. The data are available for sharing through the Network for Italian Genomes, within the COVID-19 dedicated section.

Deep learning and, in particular, convolution-based approaches are the current state-of-the-art classification models. However, in the presence of noisy hyperspectral datasets, these deep convolutional neural networks underperform. In this paper, we proposed a feature augmentation approach to increase noise resistance in imbalanced hyperspectral classification. Our method calculates context-based features, and it uses a deep convolutional neuronet (DCN). We tested our proposed approach on the Pavia datasets and compared three models, DCN, PCA + DCN, and our context-based DCN, using the original datasets and the datasets plus noise. Our experimental results show that DCN and PCA + DCN perform well on the original datasets but not on the noisy datasets. Our robust context-based DCN was able to outperform others in the presence of noise and was able to maintain a comparable classification accuracy on clean hyperspectral images.","Ramirez Rochac, Juan F.; Zhang, Nian; Thompson, Lara A.; Deksissa, Tolessa",Comput Intell Neurosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34306058/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/9923491,429

The virus surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) is responsible for both viral attachment and release. Similarity to bovine and porcine torovirus hemagglutinin-esterase (BToV HE, PToV HE), bovine coronavirus HE (BCoV HE) and influenza C hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion (InfC HEF) proteins were exploited in a computational homology-based structure analysis of ISAV HE. The analysis resolved structural aspects of the protein and identified important features of relevance to ISAV HE activity. By recombinant expression and purification of secretory HE (recHE) proteins, receptor-binding and quantitative analyses of enzymatic activities displayed by ISAV HE molecules are presented for the first time. Three different recHE molecules were constructed: one representing a high virulent isolate, one a low virulent, while in the third a Ser(32) to Ala(32) amino acid substitution was introduced in the enzymatic catalytic site as inferred from the model. The three amino acid differences between the high and low virulent variants, of which two localized to the putative receptor-binding domain and one in the esterase domain, had no impact on receptor-binding or -release activities. In contrast, the Ser(32) amino acid substitution totally abolished enzymatic activity while receptor binding increased, as observed by agglutination of Atlantic salmon red blood cells. This demonstrates the essential role of a serine in the enzyme's catalytic site. In conclusion, structural analysis of ISAV HE in combination with selected recHE proteins gave insights into structure–function relationships and opens up for further studies aiming at dissecting molecular determinants of ISAV virulence.","Müller, Anita; Markussen, Turhan; Drabløs, Finn; Gjøen, Tor; Jørgensen, Trond Ø.; Solem, Stein Tore; Mjaaland, Siri",Virus Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20398710/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170210001231; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2010.03.020; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170210001231,429

However, few targeted resources are available, which potentially limits the effectiveness of this group. Launched in 2016, the staff scientist path at Emory has tripled in size over 4 y to 138 staff. The present case study evaluated the perceptions of staff scientists related to onboarding experiences and professional development needs, including those needs arising from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) impacts in the workplace. A survey of Emory staff scientists was conducted from May to June 2019 as part of a program evaluation initiative to assess perceptions of onboarding and professional development opportunities. Interviews with a subset of scientists informed the survey development and identified COVID-19-related impacts on daily work. Results indicated the need for targeted orientation resources specific to staff scientists, accurate and timely information and resources to support scientists' supervisors, and professional development for scientists in leadership and management-related skills. Remote work associated with COVID-19 accentuated the need for managerial skills, including team development in digital work environments.

The One Health approach is a pathway to synergistically addressing outcomes in term of health and sustainability, but gender issues at the One Health and biodiversity nexus are largely ignored. By examining the roles and responsibilities of Indigenous and Local People, and especially women, in conserving natural resources, and the social costs of living at the Human-Animal-Environment interface under current conservation strategies, we show that women bear a disproportionate health, poverty and climate burden, despite having pivotal roles in conserving biodiversity. To mitigate risks of emerging infectious diseases, food insecurity and climate change impacts, a gender perspective has previously been proposed, but implementation lags behind. Endemic zoonotic diseases, human-wildlife conflict and environmental pollution lack gender-sensitive frameworks. We demonstrate that women can be powerful agents for change at all levels of society, from communities to businesses, and policy-making institutions, but gender inequalities still persist. We develop a framework for mainstreaming a gender-responsive and rights-based One Health approach, in order to heal ourselves and nature. Using a leverage-points perspective, we suggest a change of paradigm, from the pursuit of GDP and over-consumption, to a focus on human well-being and their reconnection with healthy environments, using a One Health understanding of nature and health. We recommend learning from Indigenous People to re-position ourselves within nature and to better conserve biodiversity. We also propose integration of gender equity in leadership, the respect of human rights, women’s rights (access to health care, healthy food, land tenure, natural resources, education, and economic opportunities), and the rights of nature, through the implementation of gender-responsive and rights-based One Health Action Plans, at policy-making level, in the private sector and the civil society. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unveil deep socio-economic inequities in the wealthiest economies and the vital role of nature in supporting our health, we argue to seize this opportunity to build back better and improve resilience and sustainability by using a gender-responsive and rights-based One Health approach.","Garnier, Julie; Savic, Sara; Boriani, Elena; Bagnol, Brigitte; Häsler, Barbara; Kock, Richard",One Health Outlook,https://doi.org/10.1186/s42522-020-00029-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33225225/,429

We assessed the short-term impact of a COVID-19 immunization program with varying constraints on population health and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) needs. METHODS: A SARS-CoV-2 transmission model was calibrated to French epidemiological data. We defined several vaccine implementation scenarios starting in January 2021 based on timing of discontinuation of NPIs, supply and uptake constraints, and their relaxation. We assessed the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations averted, the need for and number of days with NPIs in place over the 2021–2022 period. RESULTS: An immunisation program under constraints could reduce the burden of COVID-19 hospitalizations by 9–40% if the vaccine prevents against infections. Relaxation of constraints not only reduces further COVID-19 hospitalizations (30–39% incremental reduction), it also allows for NPIs to be discontinued post-2021 (0 days with NPIs in 2022 versus 11 to 125 days for vaccination programs under constraints and 327 in the absence of vaccination). CONCLUSION: For 2021, COVID-19 control is expected to rely on a combination of NPIs and the outcome of early immunisation programs. The ability to overcome supply and uptake constraints will help prevent the need for further NPIs post-2021. As the programs expand, efficiency assessments will be needed to ensure optimisation of control policies post-emergency use.","Coudeville, Laurent; Jollivet, Ombeline; Mahé, Cedric; Chaves, Sandra; Gomez, Gabriela B.",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0250797; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33909687/,429

To address these limitations, we examined a next-generation sequencing (NGS) and iterative mapping approach for virus detection in clinical samples. We analyzed 40 clinical specimens from hospitalized children diagnosed with acute bronchiolitis, croup, or respiratory tract infections in which virus identification by viral culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was unsuccessful. For our NGS data analysis pipeline, clinical samples were pooled into two NGS groups to reduce sequencing costs, and the depth and coverage of assembled contigs were effectively increased using an iterative mapping approach. PCR was individually performed for each specimen according to the NGS-predicted viral type. We successfully detected previously unidentified respiratory viruses in 26 of 40 specimens using our proposed NGS pipeline. Two dominant populations within the detected viruses were human rhinoviruses (HRVs; n = 14) and human coronavirus NL63 (n = 8), followed by human parainfluenza virus (HPIV), human parechovirus, influenza A virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and human metapneumovirus. This is the first study reporting the complete genome sequences of HRV-A101, HRV-C3, HPIV-4a, and RSV, as well as an analysis of their genetic variants, in Taiwan. These results demonstrate that this NGS pipeline allows to detect viruses which were not identified by routine diagnostic assays, directly from clinical samples.

The nanodecoy, made by fusing cellular membrane nanovesicles derived from human monocytes and genetically engineered cells stably expressing angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) receptors, possesses an antigenic exterior the same as source cells. By competing with host cells for virus binding, these nanodecoys effectively protect host cells from the infection of pseudoviruses and authentic SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, relying on abundant cytokine receptors on the surface, the nanodecoys efficiently bind and neutralize inflammatory cytokines including interleukin 6 (IL-6) and granulocyte−macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and significantly suppress immune disorder and lung injury in an acute pneumonia mouse model.

689385,COVID‐19 Pandemic and Shortage of Personal Protective Equipment in Tokyo Clinics,2020-05-19,"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had profound impact on health care not only for its direct effects, but also because it deeply influenced the whole clinical practice and diagnostic pathways, particularly in the acute setting. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a patient with respiratory dysfunction due to myasthenia gravis (MG) initially misdiagnosed as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection due to ambiguity in the interpretation of radiological and microbiological findings during COVID-19 pandemic. DISCUSSION: Respiratory dysfunction as first clinical manifestation of myasthenia gravis is rare, but potentially very harmful. Emergency physicians should always consider neurological diseases when dyspnea cannot be explained by cardiac or respiratory causes.","Scopelliti, Giuseppe; Osio, Maurizio; Arquati, Massimo; Pantoni, Leonardo",Neurol Sci,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10072-020-04826-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33068195/,429
